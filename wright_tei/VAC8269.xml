BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.&#xD;
'LIE favorable recep~n hich \~he public gave to&#xD;
the Widow Bedott Papers, by Mrs. F. M.&#xD;
Whither, has induced the publication of another&#xD;
volume of the works of the same author.&#xD;
It is a natural desire tlm'~ we wish to know something&#xD;
of the personal history of those who have amused or in-&#xD;
terested us, and the~ reader feels a claim upon a favorite&#xD;
writer, kindred to the claims of friendship.&#xD;
For this reason,, we have deemed it not inappropriate to&#xD;
accompany the present collection with a brief biographical&#xD;
sketch of their author.&#xD;
Itmight at first be supposed, that the life of one whose&#xD;
writings prove her' to have possessed such a remarkable va-&#xD;
riety of talents, must furnish rich and abundant material f~r&#xD;
an extended memoir. But itmust be borne in mind, that&#xD;
true "genius is often allied to oreitt delicacy and re-&#xD;
~'. UN&#xD;
serve of character. And thus while it was apparent to al~&#xD;
/&#xD;
who knew Mrs. Whither, that she was a person of supe~&#xD;
I      '                             nor intellect, she was perhaps in every-respect the oppo-&#xD;
site of all that we learn from the term, "a strong-minded&#xD;
Woman." And so singularly modest and unobtrusive&#xD;

&#xD;
were her habits, that her life might safely yield in variety&#xD;
of incident, to the humblest champion of woman's rights;&#xD;
or the most obscure victim of woman's wrongs.&#xD;
While her only claim to eminence is found in the re~&#xD;
markable genius which her writings display; a respect&#xD;
for that shrinking timidity with which she ever avoided&#xD;
publicity, seems to forbid us to do more than to dwell&#xD;
upon those features of her character which are in some&#xD;
degree the property of her readers, and our sketch, there-&#xD;
fore, will necessarily be meagre; but we shall enrich&#xD;
it with .such extracts from her letters and her poems, as&#xD;
will give to the appreciative reader ,a better idea of heP&#xD;
mental qualities than can b~ conveyed in any words of&#xD;
our own.&#xD;
Mrs. Frances Miriam Whitcher, was the daughter of&#xD;
Mr. Lewis Berry, and was born at Whitestown, Oneida&#xD;
County, New York, on the first day of November, 1811.&#xD;
This village shares with the township the name of its&#xD;
earliest settlers, and is one of the oldest, as well as one of&#xD;
the most beautiful villages in Central New York.&#xD;
That fine scenery which everywhere marks the valley of&#xD;
the Mohawk River, is spread out with particular magnifi-&#xD;
cence and beauty, in this immediate locality. The beauti-&#xD;
ful hills, the broad, luxuriant valley, and the gently&#xD;
flowing waters of the river, are among its natural attrac-&#xD;
tions, 'while the noble elms, which cast their grateful&#xD;
shadows over its principal street, are a pleasant and per..&#xD;
petual memorial of 'those who might be truly termed its&#xD;
" first families."&#xD;
In 'its earlier history, Whitestown was the shire town&#xD;
of Oneida County, awd' the courts being held here, added&#xD;
to its other attractions as a home for gentlemen of the&#xD;
&#xD;
legal profession. Many whose names have been high in&#xD;
forensic distinction and brilliant upon the pages of his..&#xD;
tory, were then counted among its citizens, and gave' to&#xD;
the social circle of that time a character for liberal culture&#xD;
and refined taste inferior to none in the State.&#xD;
Thus, fortunately, her early associations were such as not&#xD;
only furnished examples of superior mental excellence, but&#xD;
were well calculated to develop those germs of latent&#xD;
genius, the possession of which she showed even in child-&#xD;
hood.&#xD;
While' yet only two years old, and ignorant of her al.&#xD;
phabet, she learned to 'recite long pieces of poetry, and&#xD;
very early began making rhymes herself.' The first of&#xD;
these of which any record is preserved, is a parody on the&#xD;
familiar verses entitled "My Mother," ivhichwere common&#xD;
in the juvenile~Readers of that time. The " Grandfather"&#xD;
alluded to in the parody, was a member of her father's&#xD;
family, with whom the child was far from being a favorite.&#xD;
Her lines ran thus: -&#xD;
Who was it, when our friends were here,&#xD;
And In the room I did appear,&#xD;
Said, "This is Middy, she's our dear"?&#xD;
My Grandfather.&#xD;
Who was it, when I swept the floor,&#xD;
Would make me sweep it o'er a~d o'er,&#xD;
And say, "Come back and sweep it more"&#xD;
My Grandfather.&#xD;
And when I let the platter$all,&#xD;
Who said, as loud as he could bawl,&#xD;
"Now just come back and break them all"?&#xD;
~Iy Grandfather.&#xD;
A short time previous to the composition of ths parody,&#xD;

&#xD;
when five years old, she made "her first pictorial ex-&#xD;
ploit," as she afterward termed it, by drawing the likeness&#xD;
of an old gentleman, who, by familiar, but" not intention-&#xD;
ally offensive joking, had incurred her displeasure.&#xD;
The 'circumstance forms the subject of the first picture&#xD;
in a series of humorous sketches, which were made years&#xD;
afterward for a friend to whom she had promised an illus-&#xD;
trated volume of her, life.&#xD;
Her first teacher seems to have been an antiquated&#xD;
maiden, who did not sufficiently gain her respect to escape&#xD;
her ridicule; for we find her in the same series in many&#xD;
sketches, where the position evidently was not chosen for&#xD;
the benefit of the sitter.&#xD;
From this juvenile institution she was promoted 'to the&#xD;
primary department of the village academy, 'where her&#xD;
mirth-loving propensities found a new and wider field for&#xD;
exercise, which she did ~iot fail to improve; for here noth-&#xD;
ing capable of a ludicrous construction escaped her deli-&#xD;
cacy to perceive, and ability to portray; and while this&#xD;
"mischief" often brought her under discipline, her pun-&#xD;
ishments we find, in turn, made the subjects of her&#xD;
~3~ches -so emphatically did her ruling passion "grow&#xD;
by what it fed on."&#xD;
A better account of this may be learned from her own&#xD;
words, in a letter' to Mrs. Alice B. Neal, a friend to whom&#xD;
she was known only through the medium of the pen, and&#xD;
the symp~4hy of kindred intellectual tastes.&#xD;
"'Yo~ ~las't kind letter was very gratifying. The ac-&#xD;
quisition of a new friend is a 'source of great pleasure to&#xD;
me; for I assure you that it has never 'been my lot to&#xD;
have. many friends. You possess the happy faculty of&#xD;
drawing all hearts at once to you; but. I, unfortunately,&#xD;
&#xD;
do not. And I will tell you, what I believe to be the&#xD;
secret of jt: I received, at my birth, the undesirable gift&#xD;
of a remarkably strong sense of the ridiculous. I can&#xD;
scarcely remember the time when the neighbors were not&#xD;
afraid that I would 'make fun of them.' For indulging&#xD;
in this propensity, I was scolded at home, and wept over&#xD;
and prayed with, by certain well-meaning old. maids in&#xD;
the neighborhood; but all to no purpose. The only re-&#xD;
ward of their labors was frequently their likenesses drawn&#xD;
in charcoal and pinned to the corners of their 'shawls,&#xD;
with, perhaps, a descriptive verse below. Of course I had&#xD;
not many' friends, even among my own playmates. And&#xD;
yet, at the bottom of alL this deviltry, the e was a warm,&#xD;
affectionate heart -~- if any were really kiiPl to me, how I&#xD;
loved them!"'&#xD;
One little picture in the series, alluded to from her&#xD;
"ideal world," which has pleased us particularly, is en-&#xD;
titled "The Adventure." It is thus described by herself,&#xD;
during a walk on the banks of the river about a mile from&#xD;
her home, she related to her companions thus :-&#xD;
"Once I was walking here, when I 'saw on that stump&#xD;
of a tree a beautiful Bible all bound in gold lying open.&#xD;
I started to get it, when a little angel with shining wing8&#xD;
came flying dowh towards it, and when I 'reached the&#xD;
place the book was *a heap of ashes, and the angel was&#xD;
gone.~~&#xD;
Her school education was completed in her native vil-&#xD;
lage, with the exception of some lessons in French, from&#xD;
a very superior teacher in the neighboring city of Utica,&#xD;
where she acquired a' high proficiency in that language,&#xD;
but with an instinctive horror of affectation and display,&#xD;
she always avoided, both in conversation aud in writing,&#xD;
the use of any foreign words or phrases.&#xD;

16       BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.                           1310 GRAPHI6AL INTRODUCTION.      17&#xD;
&#xD;
In the t~rt of drawing, in which she has left such abun-&#xD;
dant proof of her taste and skill, her only instruction was&#xD;
a few hints from a similarly gifted relative.&#xD;
In epistolary correspondence she particularly excelled,&#xD;
her pen gliding without an effort into rhyme, and making&#xD;
the most trivial occurrences attractive by her happy power.&#xD;
of expression, as well as by the most life-like pen draw-&#xD;
ings, with which her letters are embellished, and in which&#xD;
she often introduced herself in some most ludicrous or&#xD;
preposterous manner.&#xD;
Nothing was allowed to escape her pencil or her pen,&#xD;
and even the every-day occurrences in a quiet family fur-&#xD;
nished material, which when embellished by her genius,&#xD;
became amusing and interesting. The following mock se-&#xD;
rious lines on the death of a pet crow, show her ability to&#xD;
mingle the ridiculous with the sublime:&#xD;
No sigh was heard, no tear was shed,&#xD;
/      And not a word was spoken,&#xD;
But the pale cheek and drooping head&#xD;
Told how their hearts were broken.&#xD;
There was no outward sign of woe,&#xD;
Though every hope had failed 'em,&#xD;
A chance observer scarce would know&#xD;
That aught uncommon ailed 'em!&#xD;
Manhood and youth and age were there,&#xD;
Touched with the same deep sorrow;&#xD;
~h~y thought of pne whom they must bear&#xD;
~o his harp-yard grave, to-morrow.&#xD;
There in an old tin pan he Jay,&#xD;
The once beloved an4 cherishe~,&#xD;
Alas, how soon he, passed away,&#xD;
How cruelly he perished!&#xD;
&#xD;
And one was there, once gay and spry,&#xD;
'Twas one that did adore him;&#xD;
A maniac glare was in her eye,&#xD;
She silently bent o'er him.&#xD;
She loved the dear departed crow&#xD;
Like dearest friend, or brother,&#xD;
And watched his infant graces grow,&#xD;
Just like some tender mother,&#xD;
Love, like some tender Ilower of earth,&#xD;
Long in her heart had wasted;&#xD;
Tom, like the sun, had called it forth,&#xD;
And death, like winter, blasted.&#xD;
11cr grief was silent, dark, and dcep,&#xD;
For1 oh, she loved him, dearly;&#xD;
'Tis never those who loudest weep,&#xD;
That sorrow most sincerely.&#xD;
There is a grief that dwells within,-&#xD;
A grief beyond my telling;&#xD;

"It seemed to me Mrs. Whitcher always wore the same&#xD;
dress," a remark that shows that she appreciated that sen-&#xD;
sible maxim, that "to be well dressed, a lady's attire&#xD;
should be so arranged as never to excite a thought."&#xD;
She possessed a high degree of conversational ability&#xD;
in the circle of congenial friends; their presence seemed&#xD;
to inspire her, and to devcdop many little graces and at-&#xD;
tractions which the first critical glance frightened away, so&#xD;
much that among strangers and ordinary acquaintances,&#xD;
she became reserved 'and timid to a degree which was&#xD;
often regarded as haughtiness and pride, or a sense of&#xD;
conscious superiority. But amid the genial circle of fa-.&#xD;
miliar friends, her eye brightened with intelligence, her&#xD;
features glowed with enthusiasm, while the liquid and har-&#xD;
monious flow of her words possessed almost the charming&#xD;
power of music.&#xD;
The story of the Widow Spriggins was among' the ear-&#xD;
lier productions of her pen, and was originally written for&#xD;
"The M~oonian Circle," a social and literary association,&#xD;
sustained by persons of taste and ability. The liter-&#xD;
ary productions of the Circle were presented to its mem-&#xD;
bers in the form of a paper, which was for some time&#xD;
called " The Momus," a liame which it fully merited.&#xD;
Among the members~ of the Circle, however, there, were&#xD;
some who deemed the paper too much devoted to "the&#xD;
harmless comedy of life," and it was accordingly changed&#xD;
in name, and somewhat in character, to "The M~onian.&#xD;
The circumstances form the subject of an article from the&#xD;
"M~onian," which may be found in the present volume.&#xD;
The Widow Spriggins' articles were afterward favor -&#xD;
ably, though not very extensively, introduced to the pub-&#xD;
lic by Mr. Calvert Comstock, late editor of the Albany&#xD;
&#xD;
Argus, who was at that time editing a weekly paper at&#xD;
Rome, New York, and was a personal friend of their&#xD;
author.&#xD;
She received no pecuniary compensation for any of her&#xD;
articles, until the summer' of 1346, when she became a&#xD;
regular contributor to "Neal's Saturday Gazette." Its&#xD;
editor, who was a humorist of acknowledged ability,&#xD;
highly appreciated the genius of his contributor. 'But&#xD;
neither his enthusiastic praise, nor the flattering reception&#xD;
with which her productions were received by its readers,.&#xD;
could overcome her habitual self-distrust and timidity. In&#xD;
a letter accompanying one of the Bedotts, she says:&#xD;
"I fear criticism; I fear 'the world's dread laugh.' I&#xD;
fear a repulse, a failure; there are a thousand things to&#xD;
make me shrink from taking a step which may look like&#xD;
courting publicity; and I assure you, no1~hing but the&#xD;
hope of one d~ay reaping some pecuniary benefit, induces&#xD;
me to offer myself as a contributor to your paper."&#xD;
On the sixth of January, 1847, she was married to the'&#xD;
Rev. B. W. Whitcher, and in the following spring re-&#xD;
moved to Elmira, Chemung County, where Mr. Whither&#xD;
assumed the pastoral care of St. Peter's church.&#xD;
The following playful rhyming letter, written during&#xD;
her husband's temporary absence from home, a few days&#xD;
after their marriage, may not be inappropriate here.&#xD;
I will weave an idle rhyme, dear,&#xD;

&#xD;
Her peculiar traits of character were not particularly&#xD;
adapted to her new sphere of life; her retiring and r~&#xD;
served disposition illy qualified her for a position which&#xD;
makes so great demand upon the demonstrative sympam&#xD;
thies, as that of a clergyman's wife. And, although she&#xD;
found in Elmira a few whose friendship and kindness were&#xD;
ever held in grateful remembrance, the greater number&#xD;
of her new acquaintances regarded her with distrust and&#xD;
suspicion; and her greatest pleasure was fo~ind in her&#xD;
domestic relations. As a wife, she was ever kind and&#xD;
thoUghtful,' placing a high estimate upon her marriage&#xD;
duties, requiring the i~iost refined and exalted tenderness,&#xD;
which it was her constant aim to inspire.&#xD;
In Elmira the "Bedott Papers" were continued and&#xD;
completed. The "Aunt Maguire 'Letters," published in&#xD;
Godey's Lady's Book, were written here, and a series in a&#xD;
difThrent style u~der the name of "Letters from Timber-&#xD;
yule" were begun, which her death left incomplete. A&#xD;
few of the first chapters of the story 'of Mary Elmer were&#xD;
also written at this place.&#xD;
Though. Whitelier's literary reputation will perhaps,&#xD;
most particularly be identified with her humorous works,&#xD;
she has left in 'her little poems and sketches and in the&#xD;

she was not confined, in the range of her genius, to any one&#xD;
department of literature, but might have gained a brilliant&#xD;
reputation in the various walks of authorship. Those who&#xD;

-provoking productions, will find with surprise the depth,&#xD;
tenderness, and~ spiritual beauty which her more serious&#xD;
writings reveal. Possessing at ~he same time an eye for the&#xD;
ridiculous, a sense of the grotesque in combination, and&#xD;
the quaint in character, with a genuine love of the beauti-&#xD;
fal, and admiration of the grand, her productions had'&#xD;
power not only to please the fancy, but to satisfy the higher&#xD;
wants of the mind. Even her humorous articles do not&#xD;
stand upon their wit alone as their chief merit; true, they&#xD;
make you laugh, and thus they answer the true test of their&#xD;
excellence in this respect.. And the Widow Bedott might&#xD;
have graduated as the very worst speller in the "bad spel-&#xD;
ling" school 'of 'literature so popular at the present day,&#xD;
but her humor was always the vehicle of sense "to point a&#xD;
moral or adorn a tale," and even when the widow ~iseour-&#xD;
se5 "on punkins," she reads a wholesome homily to the&#xD;
troublesome neighbor who "borroweth and repayeth not&#xD;
again."&#xD;
As an' appreciative critic has said, "There is as clear&#xD;
delineation of character in these writings as in. the works&#xD;
of Dickens or Thackeray. They are the cleverest, as 'well&#xD;
as the'~most popular of any articles of the kind by an Amer-&#xD;
ican author. Those doomed perforce to 'immortality by&#xD;
the hand now stilled forever, should be &amp;amp;itisfied that they&#xD;
have secured what so many have labored assiduously to&#xD;
obtain."&#xD;
Saxe finds" it is a very serious thing to be a fanny&#xD;
man," and Mrs. Whither found it "a very serious thing"&#xD;
to be a funny woman. Few" writers since the days of&#xD;
Coleridge have been so much at the same time ~e subject&#xD;
of panegyric by their friends and of censure from their&#xD;
enemies; for while the reading public were convulsed with&#xD;
&#xD;
laughter over the inimitable drollery and cleverness of her&#xD;
sketches, and editors were eagerly striving to ~secure the&#xD;
popularity which her contributions commanded in whatever&#xD;
publication they appeared, their author was being assailed&#xD;
with the greatest vituperation and personal insult from&#xD;
those who fancied they had unwittingly furnished models&#xD;
for her sketches; and in one instance Mr. Whither was&#xD;
threatened by a man with legal prosecution for damages,&#xD;
which Mrs. Samson Savage had done to characteristics&#xD;
which he fancied belonged exclusively to his wife, and&#xD;
other less prominent characters were zealously searched 'out&#xD;
and applied, as many an indignation meeting could witness.&#xD;
"This means you," and "this means such a one," the&#xD;
said, as 'each fitted the garment to a neighbor's back, whik&#xD;
all tmited in aiming resentment at the author with as much&#xD;
anger as if she had labelled their parcels with their individ..&#xD;
ual names.&#xD;
So high indeed ran the tide of angry feeling that it soon&#xD;
became apparenI~ that Mr. Whither's usefulness as a&#xD;
clergyman would find fewer obstacles in some other parish.&#xD;
Such a result was entirely unanticipated ,by Mrs..&#xD;
Whitcher. Her characters 'were not designed 'simply to&#xD;
represent individuals, but were types of different classes;&#xD;
and however closely they may apply to particular persons,&#xD;
it is illiberal to so universal a genius as hers as to attempt to&#xD;
confine its application simply to one locality. But not in&#xD;
Elmira alone were hunted up ~originals for her portraits.&#xD;
A few weeks after the publication of the sewing society&#xD;
articles, Mrs. Whither wrote thus to a friend :~&#xD;
"'It is an amusing fact that several villages are eon-&#xD;
tending for' the honor of being the birth-place of 'Mrs.&#xD;
Samson Savage.' A man from a village in County&#xD;

came into one Qf the bookstores the other day to get some&#xD;
'Lady's Books,' saying that they were all alive about it in&#xD;
his place, because they hadl a 'Mrs. Samson Savao'e'&#xD;
there. And we have heard from -, a village twenty&#xD;
miles distant, that they have fitted the coat to a woman&#xD;
there."&#xD;
And yet Mrs. Samson Savage and Mrs. J. Pixley&#xD;
Smith are only representatives of that large class where&#xD;
ignorance and vulgarity are only made more conspicuous&#xD;
by wealth. Sam Ludlow is a character by far too common&#xD;
in real life; an unruly son of a ruling deacon; while Per-&#xD;
milla Spriggins is but a pitiful illustration of the effect of&#xD;
the continual reading of love stories on vain and weak-&#xD;
minded girls. Almost any one can find "a Hugelina," a&#xD;
would-be-literary character among their own acquaintances,&#xD;
however limited the circle may be.&#xD;
It is true Mrs. Whither has been charged with satir..&#xD;
izing, in some of her characters, things which should be&#xD;
held sacred from ridicule. But whether Sam Ludlow&#xD;
"gets religion" for the' purpose of getting hold of the&#xD;
"old man's" purse-strings, or the Widow Bedott resorts&#xD;
to Elder Sniffles for religious instruction with habeas cor-&#xD;
pus intentions in her mind; if we examine closely~ we find&#xD;
that it' is only where selfishness and hypocrisy steal the&#xD;
cloak of piety, that they are held up and made at once&#xD;
odious and ridiculous.&#xD;
Few lives have perhaps furnished better examples of sin-&#xD;
cere piety and devotiQn than hers. That rare humility of&#xD;
which we have already spoken, was not only a part of the,&#xD;
ornament of" a meek and quiet spirit," but of one scrupu-&#xD;
lous in the conscientious discharge of duty. She not only&#xD;
loved the public services of the church, but was constant&#xD;

hud faithful in those devotions which receive the promise&#xD;
of" Him who seeth in secret."&#xD;
The following lines written during a period of suffering,&#xD;
show how well she had learned that hardest of all Christian&#xD;
lessons, resignation to the solemn ascription, "Thy will&#xD;
be done."&#xD;
Afflict me, Father; let thy heavy rod&#xD;
'Fall on my sinful head;&#xD;
I would not shun the sufferings of my God,&#xD;
whose blood for me was shed.&#xD;
Afflict me, Father; I will take the cross&#xD;
Unmurmuringly and still,&#xD;
By thy good help; and bear all earthly loss,&#xD;

Ay, slay me, Father, and I will not fear&#xD;
The coming of Death's dart,&#xD;
If I may see the Lord's kind angel near,&#xD;
To strengthen my weak heart.&#xD;
Not only in religious duties, but in the offices of friend-&#xD;
ship was she eminently uniform and faithful, and a good&#xD;
impression once made upon her feelings was enduring. In&#xD;
illustration of this tenacity of feeling, we insert a letter&#xD;
which was written not many years before her death, 'and&#xD;
which refers to an affection, of which "Time but the im-&#xD;
pression stronger made." This letter was addressed to the&#xD;
same person as the one from which our former extract was&#xD;
made.&#xD;
"I was quite alone all last evening, and my mind wan-&#xD;

always associated in my imagination with a dear sister of&#xD;
mine,' who died at sixteen, when I was oi4y five years~ old.&#xD;

&#xD;
I recollect 'her perfectly. They say she was a genius; and&#xD;
I remember that she was beautiful and joyous, and always&#xD;
good to me. I loved her better than any one else.' She&#xD;
used to put me eyery night in my' little crib, and sit and'&#xD;
tell me stories till I went to sleep, and hear me say my&#xD;
prayers and little hymns. She had a thousand winning&#xD;
ways. There was one pretty mark of love that seems very&#xD;
pleasant to me now as I look back to it. She used often to&#xD;
reward me for being good, by putting some trifle under my&#xD;
pillow after I was asleep, and it made me so happy to&#xD;
'wake in the morning and find it. How easy it is to please&#xD;
a ohild!&#xD;
"This sweet sister took more pains with me than any-&#xD;
body else ever did. It was a great calamity that I lost&#xD;
her. Yet I have alw~iys felt that there was still a bond&#xD;
between us. When I was little, I used to dream of hef&#xD;
almost every night, and, as I grew older, I thought about&#xD;
her a great deal. In my lonely rambles, I often fancied&#xD;
that she called me; even now I sometimes think I can&#xD;
'hear her distinctly pronounce my name in the night. I&#xD;
know not~ why it is 'so, but I fancy that you are like her.&#xD;
I was thinking of it last evening as I sat aloiie, and I threw&#xD;
aside my sewing and scratched down these simple verses to&#xD;
you. View the~n, dear -, not as poetry but as a little&#xD;
token of affection.&#xD;
Of the "verses ~' here mentioned, we will select two, as&#xD;
illustrative of her attachment to the memory of her sister,&#xD;
and of her~ belief in the intin~ate union between departed&#xD;
spirits and their friends on ealth : -&#xD;
True, some will call it fancy's flight,&#xD;
And say it ne'er can be,&#xD;
That in the wakeful hours of night&#xD;
An angel speaks to me.&#xD;
&#xD;
I " The wondrous and mysterious ties&#xD;
Some hearts can never know,&#xD;
That link the loved in paradise&#xD;
With those they love below."&#xD;
Another little poem adctressed to the same sister ran&#xD;
thus :-.&#xD;
MY SISTER.&#xD;
Would I were sleeping on thy peaceful breast,&#xD;
Friend of my infimt years!&#xD;
Thou who couldst lull my wayward heart to rest,&#xD;
And soothe my childish fears.&#xD;
Oh, 'tis a blessed thing like thee to die&#xD;
IBefore the dark hours come!&#xD;
Before the light reflected frorri on high&#xD;
Is lost in earthly gloom.&#xD;
Peace t~ thee, bud of paradise! expand&#xD;
In the Lord's garden; there,&#xD;
The flowers arc nurtured by the Almighty hand,&#xD;

In the autumn of 1850, Mrs. Whither returned to&#xD;
Whitestown. Her literary labors had been almost sus-&#xD;
pended during the year just passed, as her time had been&#xD;
occupied' in the care of her infant daughter. Few women&#xD;
have discharged with higher appreciation or greater love&#xD;
their maternal duties, than was now ehown in her devotion&#xD;
to her child. Her health,' which had for some time been&#xD;
delicate, now began more perceptibly to fail, and the symp-&#xD;

&#xD;
toms of the consumption, which for a' long time had hung&#xD;
like a threatening shadow over her, now made their pres-&#xD;
ence more apparent. Still she declined to receive medical&#xD;
aid, feeling reluctant to begin a contest where the struggle,&#xD;
promised to be long, and the result uncertain.&#xD;
It soon became apparent to those who loved her that it&#xD;
was,&#xD;
"The little rift within the lute,&#xD;
That by and by should make its music mute&#xD;
And slowly widening, silence all the sound!"&#xD;
- /&#xD;
Prompted by maternal affection, she applied herself to&#xD;
making her child's wardrobe and, as opportunity offered,&#xD;
resumed her labor on the story of Mary Elmer.&#xD;
It had long been her intention to write something in a&#xD;
graver style 'than anything *hich she had hitherto offered&#xD;
to the public. Much as sh~4 excelled in the comic vein, we&#xD;
think it was not chosen to gratify her own taste or inclimv.&#xD;
says, "II am heartily sick of Bedotting and Maguiring,&#xD;
tion, for in one of her le ters written from Elmira, she&#xD;
'and only wish I could be as well paid for more sensible&#xD;
matter." She would no doubt have found more pleasure in&#xD;
the exercise of a higher aiA purer taste, but her inclina-&#xD;
'~ tion was overruled by circumstances. ' The intense pathos&#xD;
of Mary Elmer may have been heightened by the fact that&#xD;
it was written during a period of physical suffering, but it&#xD;
proves that its author possessed as great power over the&#xD;
pathetic' as the risible emotions of the reader, and like the&#xD;
"immortal bard" when she chose to "come no more to&#xD;
make you laugh," possessed equal ability to present " such&#xD;
solemn scenes as cause the eye to flow,"&#xD;
Like many other humorists, hei~ natural, tendency was&#xD;
more to melancholy than to mirth, and we learn from one&#xD;
&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
who loved her, that her pen which was employed so suc-&#xD;
cessfully for the amusement of others, was' often guided&#xD;
by an eye dun with unshed tears.&#xD;
Although, like Hood, she had found the public ear&#xD;
more open to melodies than to maladies, with him she felt&#xD;
that "a life of mere laughter is like music without its(&#xD;
bass, or a picture of vague unmitigated light, while an~&#xD;
occasional melancholy is like those rich old glooms of'&#xD;
Rembrandt."&#xD;
The pathos of Mary Elmer was as easy to her pen as&#xD;
the humor of Sprigginsor Bedott; for her gifts were like&#xD;
song to the bird, or perfume to thefiower; and thus the&#xD;
success of her writings does not depend upon her energy,&#xD;
for she was easily discouraged, and always self-distrusting,&#xD;
while her humility kept her always from self-assertion,&#xD;
and often from effort. Thus her life became one of obser-&#xD;
vation, rather than of action; and to the last her literary&#xD;
productions were cast doubtingly upon the uncertain&#xD;
stream of public favor.&#xD;
She never shoved any undue devotion to the material&#xD;
and practical, and seemed strangely unconscious of the&#xD;
possession of those talents, which, if united with greater&#xD;
worldly wisdom,. might earlier have brought her th~&#xD;
grateful reward of fame, as well as those more tang-&#xD;
ible returns which the world counts as the criterion of&#xD;
success.&#xD;
That remarkable sagacity with which she appreciated&#xD;
the springs of human passion, and which with such rare&#xD;
perspicuity her writings display, she seldom brought into&#xD;
working use, for she was credulous and unsuspecting in a.&#xD;
marked, degree.&#xD;

"~il&#xD;
&#xD;
last literary labor, was left unfinished. The last letter she&#xD;
ever penned was one which accompanied some chapters&#xD;
of hc~r manus~ipt to her publisher, and was written only&#xD;
three weeks before her death. From it we make an ex-&#xD;
tract:&#xD;
"I never sent off a manuscript so unsightly as this.&#xD;
But I can do no better. You will see that it bears evi-&#xD;
dence to the trembling hand and miserable body sustained&#xD;
by opiates. Oh, the horrid stuff! There would never be&#xD;
any danger of' my becomijig' an opium-eater from choice.&#xD;
I hope the compositor will nQt be utterly confounded. I&#xD;
send three chapters, and the rest will be forthcoming' as&#xD;
soon as circumstances will permit. I have been verx de-&#xD;
sirous to finish this story, probably the last I shall write.&#xD;
And I trust there will be nothing in it 'which, dyii~g, I&#xD;
should wish to blot.' Perhaps Mr. '.may thipk the&#xD;
style too~ plain and homely. I have been so anxious to&#xD;
avoid the grandiloquent style of many of our femiile story&#xD;
writers, that I may haye gonef too far the othei~ way.1 I&#xD;
have become so entirely disgusted vith1 that sort of com-&#xD;
position applied to the commonest and most trifling, sub-&#xD;
jects, as well as to those more important, that I never.&#xD;
have patience to get through ~tn article of that descrip-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
Her manuscript ha~ been. carefully preserved by Mr.&#xD;
Whither, and it was not until after repeated efforts to get&#xD;
it completed ly others had failed, that the present writer&#xD;
attempted the task of" ending,?' not to say "finishing"&#xD;
it, not unconscious of the presumption with which the. act&#xD;
might be regarded by many, for one without literary ex-&#xD;
penence, or even literary ambition, to attemptt to add to&#xD;
anything a genius like hers had left incomplete, yet aux-&#xD;
&#xD;
34&#xD;
&#xD;
BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
ious to give to usefulness a little tale which seemed quite&#xD;
too good to be lost.&#xD;
After sending away her last letter, her health began 'to&#xD;
fail more rapidly, and her'time was devoted to more im-&#xD;
mediate preparation, for death.&#xD;
Jeremy Taylor's Holy Living and Dying was now her~&#xD;
constant companion, as it had been a solace and comfort&#xD;
in hours of health.&#xD;
She received with humility the holy communion, and all&#xD;
the consolations which the Church of England has in store&#xD;
for her departing children.&#xD;
The sun which rose on the fifth anniversary 'of her&#xD;
bridal day, shed its last rays into the room where she lay&#xD;
clothed in the bridal robes of death. With the solemn ser-&#xD;
vice of the Church she had so much loved, they committed&#xD;
her body to the dust.'&#xD;
In the rural grave-yard of her native village, in the&#xD;
little enclosure where lie those to whom. she was connected&#xD;
by family ties, and beside the sister for whose companion-&#xD;
ship' she had so long and fondly yearned, she rests. And&#xD;
who can say but in "those heavenly habitations where&#xD;
the souls of them that sleep inAhe Lord Jesus 'enjoy per-&#xD;
petual felicity," their spirits are united in nearer and purer&#xD;
ties, as in communion with the saints beneath the altar,&#xD;
they join in the solemn anthem, "How long, 0 Lord," as&#xD;
in earnest hope they wait the final benediction.&#xD;
In accordance with her own humble wishes, her name&#xD;
'and age on a little 'tablet is all . that marks 'her resting-&#xD;
place. But in the hearts of those who loved her as a&#xD;
friend, and admired her ds an author, is written a brighter&#xD;
and more enduring word of her virtues than can be traced&#xD;
by the pen of the biographer, or graven in the eloquence&#xD;
of sculptured marble.                 M. IL. NV.&#xD;

W1ie~i I was about sixteen our folks sent me to Miss&#xD;
Van Dusen's boarding-school to Scaticoke. She was a&#xD;
cousin of my mother, and whilst I was there besides lair-&#xD;
nin' all monner of accomplishmentss I took a mazin' notion to&#xD;
reading' and red Rosabelly, and Alviry, and the Childern of&#xD;
the Abby all through. Well, arter staying' there three&#xD;
months I went hum, and at my departer Miss Van 'Dusen&#xD;
give rue the Childern of the Abby, 'cause 'twas my favorite&#xD;
book and I was her favorite puppil, teRm' on me to&#xD;
read it cerfully and wouldd improve my taste and under-&#xD;
standin' amazin'ly.&#xD;
Well, I returned to the paternal ruff, and I tell ye I was&#xD;
a touch above' the vulgar, but I'd or'to tell ye how II&#xD;
looked. My hair was of that lovely hue that folks calls red&#xD;
and novels calls auburn. Sometimes I suffered it to flow&#xD;
cerlessly over my alabaster shoulders, and sometimes I con-&#xD;
fined it on the tip top of my head with a quill. My face&#xD;
was considerate immineAtly honsome. My bigger was on-&#xD;
common graceful, and I had a gret , deal of dignitude.&#xD;
But more 'n all that, I writ poetry of the first order, and&#xD;
was called the biggest genyus in Podunk. ~I knowd I was&#xD;
a touch above the vulgar, as I said afore, and so I kept&#xD;
myself putty scarce. I didn't let nun of the fellers come&#xD;
within gunshot of me tho' there want one there but what&#xD;
would a jumped sky high to git me, but I didn't incurridge&#xD;
'er~i, for I was detairmined I wouldn't give my affections to&#xD;
nobody that didn't look like Lord Mortimer, him that the&#xD;
Ohildern of the Abby tells about9 and nun of the young.&#xD;
men in Podunk want no touch to him,, for the biggest part&#xD;
on em was aniazin' fleshy and he ~&amp;amp;ant. Well, a number&#xD;
on 'em art a spell plukt up curridge to make up to me.&#xD;
There was Bonypart Buggins, a risin' farmer, he took arter&#xD;

me consairnedly. One afternoon I was a sitting' under a&#xD;
tree in the orchard reading' in the Childern of the Abby,&#xD;
and II tho't I heern a noise, so I lookt up, and lo and be-&#xD;
hold 'twas Bonypart leanin' agin a stump.&#xD;
"Your sarvent," says he~ I gin him an all-to~pieces&#xD;
stiff bow, and went on continuyin' reading , - at last says&#xD;
he, -&#xD;
"Miss Ruggles."&#xD;
"Hold yer tongue,". says I.&#xD;
"Ye needn't be so ferce," says he.&#xD;
Then I riz right up and says I, "What do ye mean by&#xD;
contrudin' yer pesky presence on my solitary modifications,&#xD;
hay? If 'twant for disgracin' this ere book I'd heave fl at&#xD;
yer head." So he cleared out considerable skeart and never&#xD;
bothered me no more.&#xD;
And there wa~ another young man in our town by the&#xD;
name of' Yokop Van Snorter, a merchant, 1~hat lived nigh&#xD;
by, makin' money and doin' well. There want a gearl in&#xD;
Podunk but what would a had him ony me, and I was the&#xD;
ony on~ he took a notion tew. But he was as fat as a&#xD;
hoss, and more 'ii all that he had such a name 'twas enuf&#xD;
to disgust me. Well, he was kinder timersome and&#xD;
darse~at speak to me, so he writ me a "billydux," (that&#xD;
are's the French for loveletter,) I can't remember edjackly&#xD;
how 'twas eupprest, ony I know he writ how't.he loved me&#xD;
better'n sour crout or flitters, or anything on airth, and&#xD;
wanted me to marry him right off. Now in all the novil~&#xD;
I'd read, nun of the y~ung men didn't make a supposition&#xD;
in sich a stile, so I jist, took it and writ on t'other side&#xD;
o'nt, -&#xD;
"You gret unheerd of Dutch lubber; ye don't know how&#xD;

* I wouldn't have ye nor touch to, so ye may giv up yer en-&#xD;

and that evening' we were all a sittin' round the kitchen lire,&#xD;
mother a dipping' candles, Nadab and Abihu twisting' nut-&#xD;
cakes, and Mirtilly a fryin' on'em, Il3emas and Ketury knit-&#xD;
tin', (my mother dedicated all her children jest alike. She&#xD;
didn't approve of havin' the boys do all the Qut-door work&#xD;
and the gears all the housork, so in the afternoon the&#xD;
gearls went out and heipt the boys chop wood and hoe&#xD;
taturs, &amp;amp;c., and in the evening' the boys cum in and heipt&#xD;
the gearls do up the chores,) but I was a reading, I never&#xD;
had nothing' to do with kitchinary consairns for I reckoned&#xD;
and mother reckoned tow, that a young woman that had&#xD;
been to boardin'-school and lairnt phizziology, and trigge-&#xD;
ology, and astrology, besides painting' jtnd mongers,&#xD;
shouldn't or'to do no housork, and I never read in nonovil&#xD;
of a heroine that washed dishes and fried nutcakes, and&#xD;
so forth. An~iandy Malviny Fitzalen didn't' do't, and Ii&#xD;
was detairmined I wouldn't do't, tWo' father used to jaw me&#xD;
about it, for he never had no sense of properiety. But I&#xD;
didn't think 'twas any disparagation to resist mother in sup..&#xD;
perintendin' the children, for I reckoned 'twas quite interest-.&#xD;
in' to teach their young ideas how to fire, as Poke says,&#xD;
and the evening' I speak on I'd jest ben piittin' Cornelus and&#xD;
Gad, and Axy and Vine, to bed in the trundle-bed, and&#xD;
was beseated reading' in Cecely, (a nov11 belonging' to a na..&#xD;
ber of ourn,) when father came in and says he to me, says&#xD;
be, '~ Milly,"- says I, "Sir!" "Come up chamber,"&#xD;
says he, "I want to see ye a minnit." So I shot up my&#xD;
interesting novil with a sythe and follered my ferce and&#xD;
grumpy looking' payrent. When we got up chamber he&#xD;
shot the door and says he, "Milly," - says I, "Sir,~~&#xD;

&#xD;
says he, "Yer a darn fool." "Be, hay," sa I, "what&#xD;
for?" "Why," says he, "I've been over to Van&#xD;
Snorter's store, and he told me all about that a e mean&#xD;
dirty trick you've ben a sarvin' him, with tears in his eyes.&#xD;
If you'd ~a writ him a decent letter tellin' on him you&#xD;
couldn't marry him, it wouldn't a ben so bad; but. even&#xD;
then you'd* a ben a fool, for you'll never git sich another&#xD;
chance, - but to send him sich a sassy, crusty mess of&#xD;
stuff; why you'd or'to be flogged for't. I tell'&amp;amp; him if I&#xD;
was him I never'd speak to ye agin, - but he says he&#xD;
takes art~r ye yit, and wants me to persuade ye to have&#xD;
him, and I tell ye ye'd better do't."&#xD;
"What!" exclamigat~d I, "me have York Van&#xD;
Snorter? why, he don't look no more like Lord Mortimer&#xD;
than a back-log does! You may manui~e me in the most&#xD;
gloomiest 4unjir~ in Podunk, you may deny me the, en-&#xD;

"Massy sakes U' says Mirtilly, "what's to pay?"&#xD;

she staid a spell and tried to ~mfort me.&#xD;
"But," says' I, "leave me, Oh leave me alone in my&#xD;

So Ketury went out and putty soon she cum back and&#xD;

So father he cum right strait home and into the chamber&#xD;

I tell ye, for that are caper of yourn.". So sayin' he cum&#xD;

I, "Go in and tell mother that I've absquandered to the&#xD;

then~" like a fair lily surcharge with tears," * I run&#xD;
across the meads and fields till I cum to a tavern about&#xD;

stuck my head all full of morning' glories that growled by                   $&#xD;

so, that's my name," reiterated I. "Won't ye come in?"&#xD;
So in he walked, and IBot a cheer for him and:he teild me&#xD;
that he'd ben' a traveling' 'for his heith and stopt a spell ill&#xD;
Podunk, a~id bein acquainted with the postmaster there,&#xD;
(Mr. Smith) he'd heern the hili 'of :my history from him,&#xD;
and he said that the account' Mr.' $mith had.givhimofmy~&#xD;
character and tippearance, mi~fo4ii~s and pairsecutious; had&#xD;
made him very muck ~oneairned and interested about me.&#xD;
This surprised me amazinlyj for I knowd Mr. Smith want&#xD;

&#xD;
I'd be astonished to see ye so besmitten at fust sight. I've&#xD;
read of sich. things time and agin, but as you're a stranger&#xD;
to me it would be onprudent in me to permit ye to pay&#xD;
your devours to me. Howsomever, I won't dis~ncourage&#xD;
ye entirely, for your mouner of declaring ' the state of yer&#xD;
feeling's has possessed me considerable in yer favor, and I'm&#xD;
purty sartin from your appearance you ain't no country&#xD;
bushwhacker; so I beseech on ye to rise.~~&#xD;
"Fairest of created creturs," says he, "I cannot rise&#xD;
till you promise to reserve a leetle corner in your heart for&#xD;
the despairing' Philander."&#xD;
Thinks me, what a beautiful name he's got. "Git up,&#xD;
Philand~r," exciamigated I, "the promise is yourn." So&#xD;
he rjz, and then says he, "Seraphic gearll grant me one&#xD;
of the flowers that decorate your head, to gaze on when&#xD;
alone." So ill gin him a morning' glory, and arter kissing'&#xD;
my lilly band he went away syin'. As he was stepping'&#xD;
out, says~ I, "Philander, be you sure your affection won't&#xD;
never prove uneonstant?"&#xD;
Says he, "jest as sure as the vast firmament of sun,&#xD;
moon, and stars moves round this terrestrious globe I&#xD;
never will be false." So I shot the door and went up&#xD;
chamber to look out of the winder at him as long as I&#xD;
could see him, and when he got over the hill t'other side&#xD;
of the house he hov away the posy I giv hint and he begun&#xD;
to laff as if he'd go off. At fust I w~is surprised to see&#xD;
him laflin' so consairnedly when 'he seemed to feel so bad&#xD;
at leaving' on me. So I watched him till he got out of&#xD;
sight, and he kept a laffin', and every little while he'd kick&#xD;
up his foot as if he was tickled, and finally I concluded he'd&#xD;
got a highsteric fit brung 'on by his overpowering' feelings.&#xD;
Arter he'd made his disappearance I sot down to read&#xD;

&#xD;
pairsecuted and miserable, and i~othin' pervents my spirits&#xD;
from sinking' into entire dispair in this tryin' hour except the&#xD;
cheerin' idee of my greacef'ul Philander." I must a looked&#xD;
very interesting' setting' there leaning' on my elbow, syin' and&#xD;
groanin', my eyes swimming' in tears, and father's cruil&#xD;
pistle lyin' afore me. So I took the Child&amp;amp;n of the Abby&#xD;
to comfert myself by reading' a spell, and turned to the 5th&#xD;
chapter cause there's a description in 't of Lord Mortimer&#xD;
that's eny most ezackly like Philander, I remember it now&#xD;
word for word, and though my Amandy Malviny Spriggins&#xD;
has got the book now there aint no need of my looking' in't,&#xD;
for to describe Lord Mortimer, it says,&#xD;
"He Was now in the glowing' prime of life his person&#xD;
was strikinly eloquent, and his mouners insinniatinly&#xD;
pleasing' seducij~i' sweetness dwelt in his smile, and his&#xD;
expressyve eyes could sparkle with cotitelligence, or beam&#xD;
with sensibility, and the harmony of his ~Voice giv a charm&#xD;
to the equation of his language which seldom or never&#xD;
failed of hem' um~esistible."&#xD;
Now that's jest the way Philander lookt. lie was very&#xD;
tall, and the slimmest creetur fever did see; his eyes was&#xD;
as black as two coals, and good grievous! how expressive;&#xD;
his hair was. black tew black and shiny as a crow's tail ;.-&#xD;
and he had gret-big whiskers; on the hull he was the f'ac-&#xD;
sinatinest beein I ever beheld. Be sure I'd a ben ladder&#xD;
'if he'd a happened to seen me and fell in love with me&#xD;
without known' who I was; wouldd a ben snore moran-&#xD;
tick Ye kpow Lord Mortimer couldn't find out for ever&#xD;
so long who Amandy was, ~rnd' he was eny most puzzled&#xD;
to pieces. But then if he did know all about me I didn't&#xD;
know nothing about him, who he was, nor where he cum&#xD;
from: ~o I had jest as mucl~ un~airtinty and disquietude&#xD;
&#xD;
consairnin him as Lord Mortimer had consairnin' Amandy,&#xD;
and I tell ye 'twas quite interest4' to be so sittyated.&#xD;
Jest then Aunt iluldy and Uncle Jonah cum hum, and&#xD;
I run down stairs and showd 'em father's letter. Arter&#xD;
they'd red it, says aunt says she,&#xD;
"The consairned old hog! he's mistaken if he thinks&#xD;
I'm a guayne to let ye work for a livin' - so he may just&#xD;
hang up his fiddle - and ye needn't be nun ~onsairned&#xD;
about it; ye shan't work nor touch tew.". -&#xD;
"Oh my darling' relative," says I, flingin' my arms&#xD;
round her and kissing' on her, "yer extrornary kindness 'in&#xD;
this gret and sad emairgency will never be blotterated from&#xD;
my rememberation.* But I shan't be unindustrious, for&#xD;
the idee of bein' manured in a factory as father threatens, is&#xD;
shocking' to me, so I'll retire to my compartment and&#xD;
ponderate for a spell,~and then cuin and tell ye the result&#xD;
of my circumfiexions."&#xD;
So IL went into my chamber and was a wondering' what&#xD;
Amandy would a did in sich a dilamby - when all of a&#xD;
scudding I happened to think how't when she had' so much&#xD;
trouble with Lord Mortimer's father she went off to Scot-&#xD;
land and kept school, and thinks me, I'll keep school tew.&#xD;
So I went into the pitching and sot down betooxt uncle&#xD;
and aunt, and I say-s to 'em, says I," Dear friends - re-&#xD;
duced as I be to the dretful alternative of doing suthing&#xD;
for a livin' or beein' shot, up in a horrid dunjin, I've 'con-&#xD;
cluded what occerpation I'd folly."&#xD;
"What is't?" says they.&#xD;
I continued~ "What can be more interesting' and digni-&#xD;

sa~ Well, I'll be darned if I know now what ye mean,"&#xD;
UncleJonah.&#xD;
"You gret coot you," says Aunt iltildy says she&#xD;
"don't ye know nothing ? she means she'll teach a siminary;&#xD;
and now that's jest what Higgins Patent needs to make it&#xD;
a rael gihteel place."&#xD;
"Yes," says uncle, "and Permilly's the very one to&#xD;
do it, for any body that knows so many big words as she&#xD;
does, ort-to keep a siminary and I'll see about it right&#xD;

Arter tea I retired to my chamber. 'Twas a despot&#xD;
charming' moonshiny evening' and I sot down by the winder,&#xD;
and the beauty of the prospect, and the stars, and the&#xD;
moonshine, and the gentle breezes that fanned my cheek,&#xD;
and the quiosity of natur, and the idee of my own individ..&#xD;
dyal sorters begun to operate so on my inimaggination that&#xD;
I was overpowered with mawlancholy, and so I sung&#xD;
"blu&amp;amp;eyed Mary," (1 was a very purty singer I be&#xD;
yit,) and jest as I'd got done that affectin' line where it&#xD;
says,&#xD;
"I now am sorrer's child."&#xD;
I heei~n somebody heave a sythe; so I looked out of the&#xD;
winder, and Jo and behold 'twas Philander standing' about&#xD;
three feet from the winder.&#xD;
"Enchantin' beein!" says he, "yer music has eny most&#xD;
annilliated me! enrapurin' tones! ravishin' strains!"&#xD;
" Oh Jemmeni !" says I, "I'm sure I shall faint away.&#xD;
I'm so flustered seem' you here; if you'd only gone off&#xD;
without syin' or sayin' nothing' wouldd a ben jest like Lord&#xD;

"Oh 1" says he, "if his surprise and delight had a ben&#xD;

of exciamigatiOn, 0 Miss Ruggles, I'm a lingering' round&#xD;

the dear flower you giv me - I've gazed on it ever sen."&#xD;
"Massy!" says I, "I see ye heave it away when ye&#xD;
got along a-piece, and I should like to know what made&#xD;
ye kick up and laff so. I reckoned ye'd got the high-&#xD;
steriCs."&#xD;
"Not so," says he, "'twas a conniption-fit - I'm sub-&#xD;
ject to 'em arter beein' overcome as I was when I fust see&#xD;
you - when I recovered I returned and pickt up this&#xD;
flower."&#xD;
Says I, "It looks as fresh as if yot~d jest pickt it off this&#xD;
ere vine.&#xD;
"I've kept it fresh," says he, "with my tears while it&#xD;
was sticking' in 'the buttonhole nighest my. heart."&#xD;
"I entreat you to depart and leave me," says I;&#xD;
Atnandy used to very often send Lord Mortimer off9&#xD;
"Sweetest of maidens!" says Philander says he, "I&#xD;
obey your high bequest." So sayin' he vanished and'dis-&#xD;
appeared, and I took my pencil and paper and. writ the&#xD;
follerin' "stauzys by moonlight."&#xD;
Iu,%ay distractin' sittyation,&#xD;
Oblee~ed from hum to wander,&#xD;
I han't but jest one consolation,&#xD;

"Why," says he, "I think we'd or't to find out the&#xD;
hull, for I'm sure I don't want to send my porter to school&#xD;
to a person that ain't respectable, if, she's ever so accom-&#xD;
plished."&#xD;
"No more don't I," says Squire Jones .--" nor I&#xD;
nyther," says all the rest.&#xD;
j tell ye I couldn't hold in no longer; so I stuck my&#xD;
bead out of the winder, and says I, "Misters I" They&#xD;
all lookt up, and when they see we th~y was bethunder-&#xD;

pen in, and laid t'other on my heart, and was jest a guayne&#xD;
to begin when, Obadiah he see me and says he,&#xD;
"Golly! Miss Ruggles, is that you? well, I've fetched&#xD;
y er old chist" -&#xD;
What else he signed~ to~say I don't know, for Dr. Davis&#xD;
took holt on him and shook him and says he,&#xD;
"Stop yer yaw-hawin; don't ye see the lady's guayne&#xD;
to speak."&#xD;
So he etopt and I begun agin, and addressed 'em as&#xD;
folders: "Gentlemen - as ye don't know nothing' con-&#xD;
sairnin' me only what you've heern from this ere ignorant&#xD;
creetur, I spose you must entertain strange idees about&#xD;
me; but if you knowd what I've underwent to hum - if&#xD;
you knowd my afflictions, and maltreatment, you wouldn't&#xD;
blame me nun for lobsquanderin', nor ye wouldn't listing a&#xD;
ininnit to the agrogious disrepresentations this killing pro-&#xD;
mulgates, and if you'll call on me this afternoon ru tell&#xD;
ye the hull of my history from eend to eend."&#xD;
So they convairsed together a spell and then Dr. Davis&#xD;
he stept out from the middle on 'em, and says he,&#xD;
"We'll do ourselves the honor of calling on~ Miss Rug-.&#xD;
gles this afternoon."&#xD;
So sayin' he hysted his hat and made a low bow, and I&#xD;
made a curchy, and the men they went hum, but I oh-&#xD;
sairved Dr. Davis look back at me in admiration, and I&#xD;
knowd he was besruitten at fust sight; but thinks me, it&#xD;
won't do to ineurridge him, for my affections is unrecover-&#xD;
ably' gin to another; (Dr.. Davis w~s a widdyer, a very&#xD;
nice, smart man-very much set b9 - and an oncommou&#xD;
good physicianer too.) Well, Uncle Jonah he went out&#xD;
and brung in my chist, and then I read my advertisement&#xD;

he telid me to write four or five on 'em to stick up in the&#xD;
towns round there. S~ I did and when I'd got 'em writ&#xD;
I reckoned twas time to habiiate myself for the company&#xD;
that was a comm' to see me, ~o I ~nlocked my dust, and&#xD;
took out a white dimity with a long short with a blue rib.-&#xD;
bin' round the bottom on't, and put it on, and 'tied a red&#xD;

ribbin round my head and stuck, a numbe~' of' morning'&#xD;
*   glories in it; then I' huv a pink silk long shawl round' my&#xD;
neck, and my twilight was completed. So you see I didn't&#xD;
depart from the elegant simplicity always conspicuous in&#xD;
my dress. Arter dinner I went and sot down in the&#xD;
square room and purty soon .1 heerd a master loud talking'&#xD;
so I looked out, 'and~ 'twas Dickens, and Jones, and&#xD;
'Peabody, and Doty, and their wives, and Dr. Davis, a&#xD;
.comin' up the hill; so I fixed myself in a reclinin' poster,&#xD;
and took the Chuldern of the Abby and begun reading .&#xD;
IPurty soon they knockt, and Aunt Huldy she' hollered,&#xD;
"Walk in " -~so in they all cmxi, and aunt she introduced&#xD;
us, and the gentlemen made bows, and the ladies and me,&#xD;
we made curchys to one another, and we all said' we&#xD;
hoped for better acquaintance. Artier talking' about the&#xD;
weather a spell, says Missis Peabody says she,&#xD;
"So you're a guayne to set up seminary, hay?"&#xD;
~' I sign to," says I, "if I can git patternage"&#xD;
'Says Missis Dickens says she, "we've all agreed td send&#xD;
oi~r dorters to ye, but we've heern rather an unfavorable&#xD;
account~on ye from ~tin pedlar from your place."&#xD;
S aye Deacon Peabody says he,   'my wife and I we thot"&#xD;
says Missis Peabody, interruptin' of ltim "I teild&#xD;

"No, you didn't," says she, "'twas we said it to you&#xD;

they kept on continuing talking' for ever so long, and at last&#xD;

J 'md as I don't desire to employ my fair hands in wroughtin'&#xD;

All the while I was makin' this speech ye never see a&#xD;
surprisder looking' set of folks than them I 'was addressing'&#xD;
and for a spell arter I'd done there wan't a word spoke&#xD;
- and Dr. Davis he seemed to be wonderfully affected,&#xD;
for he turned his face round and lookt out the winder all&#xD;
the time. At last says Deacon Peabody says he,&#xD;
" Well, I never beeltd sich a ~master sight of crooked&#xD;
wards in my day. I rather guess my porter han't no&#xD;
season to lairn sich stuff." I s'pose Missis Peabody was a&#xD;
waiting' to see what opinion the deacon would express so 's&#xD;
to have hem conterary to it, for she broke right in and&#xD;
says she,&#xD;
* ' "I rather guess, mister Deacon Peabody,' ittle be as I&#xD;
say. My Mirandy shall go to this ere young woman's&#xD;
school, for, I never heerd nobody use eleganter language&#xD;
in my life, so you may shet yer head,"&#xD;
&#xD;
I tell ye the deacon did shet up his head and lookt as&#xD;
if he wished he hadn't opened it. As soon as Missis 'Pea-&#xD;
body ixprest her mind the rest of the wimmin up and&#xD;
agreed with her, and it was '~urty evident that she was the&#xD;
rulin' woman in Higgins Patent. They all on ~em said&#xD;
they'd patternise me, and the men they lookt purty grumpy,&#xD;
but they darsent say a word.'&#xD;
Arter a spell, says Deacon P. says he, "I guess we'd&#xD;
better be goin'."&#xD;
"Well, I guess I ain't a guayne 'to be in no hurry,"&#xD;
says his wife, "you may go as soon as you please, tho'."&#xD;
"So may you," says Missis Dickens to her hu~band.&#xD;
"So may you'," says Missis I)oty to hem.&#xD;
"So may y~u," says Missis Jones to the squire, and so&#xD;
the men folks ~went off, and the wimmin stayed. "Now&#xD;
do take off yer things and stay to tea," says Aunt Huldy.&#xD;
"Well, I didn't cum to siay," says Missis Peabody.&#xD;
"Nor I nyther," says Missis Dick~ns.&#xD;
"Me nyther," says Miseis Jones.&#xD;
"No more didn't I," says Missis Doty.&#xD;
"But I don't know but I'll stay," says Missis Peabody.&#xD;
"Well, I guess I will," says all the others.&#xD;
So they took off their things, and purty soon every one&#xD;
on 'em hailed out their nittin' work, and I tell ye, they&#xD;
want nun on 'em slow to talk but I can't spend time ~to&#xD;
tell about their visit. In the evening' arter they'd all, gone,&#xD;
I went out to take a walk, and as I w'ent by the house&#xD;

behpld, 'twas Philander leanin' agin a tree with his honker-.&#xD;

"Alas!" says he, "lovijest of created being's, I must&#xD;

" Leave me!" says I, " I shall sairtin faint away; do&#xD;

says he, "Compose herself, my angell"&#xD;

S soon as Aurory had opened the porticos of the&#xD;
horizoA, the fair Permilly ariz and ~arranged her&#xD;
attire - for 'twas the momentuous morning' that&#xD;
her seminary was guayne to begin. I put on a&#xD;
yaller streeked open gownd with a flounce round it, and a&#xD;
long green sash round my waist, and a blue crape turbine&#xD;
on my head, with one long black ostrtdge feather stuck in&#xD;
it, then I put niy pink silk long shawl round my neck,&#xD;
and then condescended down into the breckfust room.&#xD;
Arter breckfust Uncle Jonah he gin me his watch, sayin'&#xD;
I'd need a time-piece in school. 'Twas an exttornary gret&#xD;
silver watch -don't' see no sich big watches no~r~days.&#xD;
So I tied it to a red ribbing and hung it round my neck,&#xD;
and 'twas so big I couldn't stuff it under my sash, sol let&#xD;
it hang outside. Bein' all ready for a start I happened to&#xD;
think how't I or'to carry Philander's picter with me all&#xD;
the time, and what to do I didn't know, for I was afeard&#xD;
wouldd get rubbed out. So I went to Uncle Jonah and&#xD;
axed him if he hadn't sum kind of a small flat box he&#xD;
could lend me (didn't tell him what I wanted on't&#xD;
hadn't said a word to him nor Aunt Huldy about Philan-&#xD;

backer box with a snap to it and axed me if wouldd do.&#xD;
"That are's the very thing." So I put the~ picter in't,&#xD;
and jammed it under my sash, and tookiny parrysol and&#xD;
set out for school, and as II went by the housen 'twas curus&#xD;
to see the folks peeking' out and. exolaimin', "There goes&#xD;
the new school-ma~m. Did you' ever!" an4l sich like.&#xD;
*   Well, I cum to ~the deacon's and Missis Peabody she&#xD;
cum to the door and showed me the way into the school.&#xD;
room, aud you never heerd sich a racket as there was&#xD;
there afQre I went in, but as soon as they see me they&#xD;
was as still as mice. There was about thirty gearis there,&#xD;
* and a number cmxi in arter I did, so't I had forty~seven in&#xD;
the hull, and sum on 'em -was purty big; so I made the&#xD;
big ones s'~t on one side and the leetle ones on otherr side,&#xD;
and arter i'd~ got 'em all arranged, says I, "Siminary's&#xD;
begun:" and then I made 'em read round in the English&#xD;
Reader. Arter they'd read, I axed 'em if they'd ever sy..&#xD;
phered, and they all said "No." So I tell'd 'em to take&#xD;
their slates, and I was surprised to find out that more'n&#xD;
half on 'em couldn't make figgers so I tell'd 'em to take&#xD;
the rethmetic and copy 'em out on't.&#xD;
"KNow," says I, "make one side of yer slates jest as&#xD;
full of fingers as ittle hold." - So they did; and then says&#xD;
Mirandy Peabody says she, "What shall we do next?"&#xD;
'~ Don't ye know nothing? " says I, "make t'other side&#xD;
full." So they did: and then says Mirandy," What next?"&#xD;
"Rub 'em out," says I,-" and put up yer sites; ye've&#xD;
syphered enuff for one day; the big ones may go out&#xD;
whilst I hear the little ones spell," (for spelling' I always&#xD;
'tho't was the most importinate part of eddycation:) so I&#xD;
made the little gearls stand up in a row, and I to9ka spell-&#xD;
in' book in one hand and a switch in t'other, and says I,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now the fust one that misses shall be whipt and go to the&#xD;
foot."&#xD;
"Well," says Drusilly Doty, says she, "what w4il'l be&#xD;
did to me if I miss?" (she was to the foot.)&#xD;
"Nun of yer s~trce," says I. Well the fust time round&#xD;
they all spelt right but Philandy Dickens, and I did as I&#xD;
said I would to her. Next time round I put out "grub,"&#xD;
'to Hepsy Hawkins; 'she was to the head, a a s she,&#xD;
"g-r-w-eb, grub."&#xD;
"There aint no sich letter as 'eb,'" says I, "go down&#xD;
to the foot." So she started and run as fast as ever she&#xD;
could so's I couldn't git a chance to whip her.. "Now,&#xD;
Hepsy Hawkins," says I, "to pay for that are trick of&#xD;
your'n you shall always be in a ~Aass by herself."&#xD;
"Good!" says she, "then I shall always be at the&#xD;
head."&#xD;
"Go long and set on the floor under the table," says I.&#xD;
So she went and then I put it out to Bricy Stokes and she&#xD;
spelt it right. "Now," says II, "what's 'the meaning&#xD;
on't?" Bricy couldn't tell, nor nun of the rest on 'em.&#xD;
So says I, "What eats up the cabbages ~"&#xD;
"Why, folks," says Ritty Rickets.&#xD;
"Well," says I, - "what eats 'em up when they're&#xD;
growing' in the guarding "&#xD;
Says she, "The critters gits in and eat 'em sum-&#xD;
times."&#xD;
"Don't ye know nothing? " says I, "why worms eats&#xD;
'em and worms is grubs."&#xD;
"Now," says Melissy 'Peabody, "I know what for&#xD;

Arter a spell I tell'd 'em they might go out and send the&#xD;
big ones in. So they run hollering' and yelling' and tearing'&#xD;
down stairs, and it did seem as if the, hull house would&#xD;
cum down. Thinks me, P11 f~z 'em for that. Purty soon&#xD;
flepsy Hawkins - she't was under the table -~ says to&#xD;
me&#xD;
"Miss Ruggles, maytent I go out?"&#xD;
"No, ye inaytent," says I.&#xD;
"I'm sorry I was sassy," says she, "I won't be never&#xD;

"' Well, go," says I. Whilst she was guayne, says I,&#xD;
"Ye'll never be sassy agin, kay?" -&#xD;
" No, straw," says she, and cut out of the door.&#xD;
Thinks me, she'll gitit! Well, the big gearls cum in and&#xD;
I axed 'em if they'd ever studied grommer. Most on 'em&#xD;
said they had sum. "Well," says I, "it's best to 'be&#xD;
pairfect in't; and seem' you've' studied' sum afore, ye may&#xD;
lairn half' way through 'at once so's td git done quick and&#xD;

took and slung her round and round, and made her go&#xD;
back under the table4 Well, they all yelled and bellered&#xD;
'like1 split; you never heerd sich a racket, I'm sartin.&#xD;
Purty soon I lookt at my watch and see 't~ras time to let&#xD;
out, so I tell'd 'eni they might go hum, and they all went&#xD;
only jest ab6ut a dozen that brung their dinners; I'd brung&#xD;
mine tew - for 'twas most a ~xnild to Uncle Jorrockses&#xD;
so I took it out of my undispensible and eat it. 'It sub..&#xD;

&#xD;
hunk of cheese, a pickle, and an apple turnover. That&#xD;
was all' the dinner I tool~, for I never had no great of an&#xD;
appetite - bein' like Amandy, ye know she only took sum&#xD;
"slight refreshments" and whilst I was eatin' thinks&#xD;
me, I wonder if Amandy ~had sich a ~tussle gittin' along&#xD;
with her school as I do; I'll look into the Childern of the&#xD;
Abby when I get hum and see, for I've eny most forgot;&#xD;
my memory's rather forgetful sumtimes, but 0 I I never&#xD;
shall forget my Philander. So I topk out my tobaccer box&#xD;
and lookt at him. Arter~" gazin' on't with agoniziji' ten-&#xD;
derness '~ for a spell, and syin' and groanin' and kissing'&#xD;
on't, I put it back, and I see all the gears a whispering'&#xD;
and wondering ; so says I to 'em:&#xD;
"0 gears I the belovedest and vallyablest thing I've&#xD;
got is in this ere box."&#xD;
"What is it?" says they, "and what makes ye cry and&#xD;
groan over it so?" '~&#xD;
"Ax me no questions,'~ says I~" I don't desire to dis-&#xD;
pose confidence in nobody."&#xD;
Well, purty soon the scholars all cum in and I begun&#xD;
school. Then I made the little ones all take their sowin',&#xD;
only Hepsy Hawkins and. sent her under the table agin,&#xD;
and she went without makin' a apeck of fuss. I see she&#xD;
had sumthin' under ~her apern and I axed her what 'twas,&#xD;
an(1 she said 'twas her spelfin'-book. Well, I sot the little&#xD;
gears to sowin'; sum on 'em had pieces of caliber to&#xD;
make bed..kivers on, and sum on 'em had cloth to lairn to&#xD;
mark letters and make birds and trees 'on. Then I heerd&#xD;
the big ones recite in grimmer, and they kept a stopping' for&#xD;
me to ax 'em questions, but says I, "That an't. no way;&#xD;

ye must begin to the beginning' of yer lesson, and say clean&#xD;

but they made blunderin' work on't I had to keep tellin'&#xD;
on 'em all the time what cum next, and when they got&#xD;
into eases it earn Sophire Joneses turn and she'd forgot&#xD;
what cum next. So says 1, "Nammi, Poesmine,' Oh-&#xD;
jine." Says Sally Ann Higgins, says she, "Miss Rug-&#xD;
glee, what's the meaning' of them are words? they're&#xD;
master queer!"&#xD;
Says I, "Miss Sally Ann Higgins, I gue~s ye hadn't ben&#xD;
under' very good deseplyne in the schools ye've ben to afore&#xD;
yit, or ye wouldn't darst to ax yer school-inarm questions,&#xD;
and sich questions! want to know what's the meaning' of&#xD;
Nomini, Posswine' Objine! Why, its grimmer that's&#xD;
the meaning' on't so shet yer head."&#xD;
When they'd got don~ sayin' grommer I' tell'd 'em they&#xD;
~night~ paint the rest of the afternoon. So they took out&#xD;
their velvet and paints and cam to I'd forgot my picters "~&#xD;
so I sent Ann Mariar Dodge 'down arter 'em and when she&#xD;
cum back I tho't I'd give 'em Nomy and Ruth for the fast&#xD;
lesson. So I stuck it up agin the wall and heipt 'em cut&#xD;
out the theories, and they begun, and sum on 'em done&#xD;
very well, but sum made dretful work, 'specially about the&#xD;
artificial flowers and feathers on Ruth's bunnit, and sum on&#xD;
'em made Nomy's 'nittin'~work look as if all the stitches&#xD;
* was dropt. Byrne-by I tell'd 'em to put up their painting'&#xD;
and sowin' and put on their things, for 'twas time to let out&#xD;
school, - so they did. Then I tell'd 'em to stand up in a&#xD;
r6w all' round the edge of the room. "Now," says 'I,&#xD;
"clasp 'yer bands across yer waists as I do -now make&#xD;
yer manners as I do." Then I made a low church, and&#xD;
they all did jest as I did., "Now," says I, "I shall sus-&#xD;
&#xD;
pect ye to make yer manners ev~ry arternoon when school's&#xD;
out without my showing' of ye, how - Siminary's out."&#xD;
* So they ali' went hum only Hepsy Hawkins - I made her&#xD;
stay a spell arter. So I slickt up my~' table, and then I&#xD;
called Hepsy Hawkins out and says I,&#xD;
"Be ye sorry for disbehavin' so to-day 1" Says she,&#xD;
"Yis, marm?'&#xD;
Says I, "Won't ye never misconduct so agin?"&#xD;
"No, marm," says she. ".Well then ye may go hum,"&#xD;
says I. So she ketehed her bunnit in less than no time&#xD;
and run off hum. Then I took my parrysol and walked&#xD;
eff humwards with the greatest deliberosity and dignitude&#xD;
for I reckon a school-marm can't be tew digniEed. Whilst&#xD;
I was a guayne' along every body lookt out of the binderr&#xD;
and laift, and I met a hull grist of boys gt~ayne hum from&#xD;
deestrict school, and they hoorawed and clapt their hands.&#xD;
Thinks me, IL wonder if this ere's the way they suppress&#xD;
their adinireation to Higgins Patent. At last wheW I was&#xD;
eny most hum I met a young man descendin' up the hill&#xD;
he had yeller hair, and a .gret red face and snuff-colored&#xD;
clue on and a slate under his arm. Well, he stared at me&#xD;
and jest as I'd got along by says he, "Marm!"&#xD;
Saysl, "Hay!".&#xD;
Says he, "Did you know there's a dead critter tied to&#xD;
your sash?"&#xD;
"Gracious'!" says I, "you don't say so." So he stept&#xD;
up and took it off for me and as true as natur' 'twas an old&#xD;
dried-up dead hen, and I lnowd in a' minnit that Hepsy&#xD;
Hawkins had did it while I was a fixin' my table. 1 never&#xD;
in my hull life had anything happen to me that made me&#xD;

His hair is black - his hands is white.-.&#xD;
His voice is sweet his eyes is bright.&#xD;

HE second day I kept school as I was a winding' my&#xD;

fighting' and throwing' stuns.' When the young man ~ee me,&#xD;
says he, "Yer sarvent, marm."&#xD;
I bowed to him putty stiff, and he cumn right u~ and sot&#xD;
down aside of me, and, says he, -&#xD;
"Seems to me ye look inawlancolly, young woman;&#xD;

"Well," says he, "if ye'll show me that are treshure,&#xD;

er box, and arter looking' at it a minnit says he, "I swan-&#xD;
ny! I' don't wonder ye cry when ye look at it, for it's the&#xD;
consairnedest looking' thing ever I see. What in natur' do&#xD;
ye keep it for?"&#xD;
I grabbed the box and riz up without sayin' a word, and&#xD;
walked off indignatious.&#xD;
"Curus cretur, by golly," says the young man; then&#xD;
he ketcht up a club and took arter the boys, and they all&#xD;
run hooting' and bellerin' down the hill, and I didn't see&#xD;
no more on 'em. When I arrove to hum I found Aunt&#xD;
Huldy beginning' to rigg for the party, so I begun to fix&#xD;
tew. And I'll tell ye how I drest; I reckon I neyer lookt&#xD;
equal t~ what I did that evening , in my life. j put on a&#xD;
white spencer with sh~orL eieeves and blue ribbons tied roi~nd&#xD;
the bottom ~n 'em, whic~i counteracted finely with my&#xD;
snowy arms; then Ii wore a yaller canton ompe skeart&#xD;
with' red ribbon loopt~ up all ~j'ound the bottom on't, and a&#xD;
pink-'sash round my waist. My hair was quirld up on the&#xD;
tip-top of my head, and confined with a dretful high-toppt&#xD;
comb, (I've got it now,) and was jest a guayne to put my&#xD;
artifishel wreath on my head; when thinks me, I wonder&#xD;
how Amandy 'd a fixed her head on sich a casion.' So I&#xD;
took the Childern of the Abby and red where it tells about&#xD;
her guayne to Missis Kilcorban's ball, and I found she had&#xD;
on a turbine with sum feathers in't. So I took my green&#xD;
shawl with sprangles all over it and wound it round and&#xD;
round my head, and' stuck sii black ostridge feathers in't.&#xD;
Then thinks me, I must put a chain to 'Philander's pieter,&#xD;
&#xD;
IYIDO If SPRIG GItjS.&#xD;
&#xD;
as Amandy used. to have to her mother's - (wonder she&#xD;
didn't wear Lord Mortimer's, but I s'pose 'twas so big she&#xD;
couldn't.) So I took a string of glass beads as big as&#xD;
bullets, and all the different colors ever ye see, and fas-&#xD;
tened the box to it and hung it round my alagaster neck.&#xD;
Jest as ide finished habiliatin, Aunt Jiuldy cum in, and&#xD;
says I, " Aint ye struck with my surpassin' loveliness "&#xD;
"Yis, I be,." says she; "I never see ye look so putty;&#xD;
but how do I look?"&#xD;
"As well as could be expected," anserd I," from a wo-&#xD;
man that's past the moridion of youthful facksination."&#xD;
"Well, cum on then, if yer ready," says she; "but we&#xD;
must eat suthin afore we go, tho' I haint no doubt Missis&#xD;
Wilkins '11 have enuff stuff to eat." So we went into the&#xD;
pitching and aunt and uncle eat 3 'or 4 bowls full of butter-&#xD;
milk' pop, but I didn't eat but a little mite. 'Then I put&#xD;
on my monte to kiver my clus, so's the folks wouldn't be&#xD;
staring' at my unresistable elegance along the road, and huv&#xD;
my leno vail over my head and we sot off. Well, we got to&#xD;
the place o~" rendyvows," and Aunt Huldy and a hull grist&#xD;
of wimmin that cum in just behind us went into 'the dress-&#xD;
in'-room to take off their~ things, but I sot dowxi by a win-&#xD;
der in the ~ia1l, and when the wimmin cum out to be rush-&#xD;

she, "Why don't ye take off y~r mantle and cum along?"&#xD;
"Cause nater," says I.&#xD;
Why," says she, " they'll think queer on't."&#xD;

in and I was left alone to my solemeolly run~irations.* Ar-.&#xD;
ter setting' there a spell I heerd a noise, and purty\soon&#xD;
soiiie~folks begun to condescend and says one,&#xD;
"0 doctor, I'm half. frightened to death!" and says&#xD;
another, "I'm skirt tew." The door stood on a jar and&#xD;
they pusht it open and went in. Arter they'd shet the&#xD;

I took off my montle, ~agested my feathers, and so forth, and&#xD;
opend the door, and lo and behold, the minister was a&#xD;
prayin' - thinks me, I wonder if they always begin their&#xD;
parties here witk praying ; but I didn't ker. So I recovered.&#xD;
my oomposher,~ and with my natural elegance walkt up the&#xD;

Stept along, and seem' a sofy at the upper eend of the&#xD;

sot down in a cheer and put my fan up afore my face, and&#xD;
I guess I kept it there ~a spell. Byrne by the minister got&#xD;
done praying' and beg7m marrying' of 'em and thinks me,&#xD;
I'll giv a look and see who 'tis. So I lookt up and my&#xD;

"Do for grammany's sake open it and s~e what's in't,"&#xD;
says i~1issis Hawkins, (she spited me on, account of the&#xD;

it round when Johnson he ketcht it away from him and&#xD;
without ever looking' at it gin it to me.&#xD;
"Ten thousand million thanks," jackleated I, "I ~&#xD;
a knowd that ~anybody that lookt so much like Philander&#xD;
in face and bigger couldn't help resembling' of him in nobli-&#xD;
tude of mind." Johnson's face turnd as red as fire. I&#xD;
spoi~e he felt dashed to be praised up by si~h an interesting'&#xD;
bein' as I was.&#xD;
"Now," says I, "IF wish sumbody'd recoverate my&#xD;

So Johnson he rummaged round and found it and gin&#xD;
it to me, and I put the profile into't and stuift it under my&#xD;
sash, and went and sot down in a cheer at the murder eend&#xD;
of the room. Purty soon Spriggins cum up with the three&#xD;

"Have you ben up to slute the bride!" says Johnson.&#xD;
"No," says I,' "I guess taint best - ittle ony make the&#xD;

says I, "if I stare at ye considerable, for you do look&#xD;
amazingly like sumbody I know.&#xD;
"0 stare as much ~s ye please," says he, "IF like to be&#xD;

"Well, you'll take sum of the egg-nogg; won't ye 1"&#xD;
says Spriggins, hollering' at the same time to a nigger.&#xD;
wench that - was carrying' round a server full of suthin' to&#xD;

"These ere timbales aint full enuff," says Spriggins, so&#xD;

Everybody in the room was looking' at us - pertickleely at&#xD;

Uncle Jonah he was clear acrost the room and he hollered&#xD;
out,&#xD;
"Don't tease Milly to let into the vittals and drink;&#xD;
she's right when she says she han't no casion, for she eat&#xD;

if she takes down all that are stuff she'll sairtin be sick&#xD;
"Gracious " say~ ill, "that are's the everlastinest lie I&#xD;

"So 'tis," says Aunt Huldy. "She ony eat tew bowls&#xD;

I tell ye it did -seem as if I should i~pire. "0 misery&#xD;

Tornson he took holt of t'other and Wilkins he too&#xD;

consairnedly half scart out of his wits. And whilst&#xD;
they was a takin' of me out - my head hanging' over on&#xD;
Johnson's shoulder - my feathers fell out of my turbin, and&#xD;
says I, "Sumb~dy jest pick up them ~are ostridge feathers&#xD;
afore they git stompt on."&#xD;
"I vanny she aint faint," says Missis Hawkins.&#xD;
"I be faint tew," says I. So they took me into the&#xD;
hail and sot me down on the stairs, and sum on 'em blowd&#xD;
me and sum on 'em stuift smeflin' bottles up my nose. Dr.&#xD;
Davis he felt of my pulse and his hand trembled dretfully,&#xD;
and tho' my eyes was shot I could tell that he was dret-&#xD;
fully agitated. Purty soon Jones (mean crittur) he took&#xD;
and stuift a nastyfetity pill down. my mouth and made me&#xD;
as sick as a dog. So then I cum tew, and I riz up and&#xD;
says I, "I think I've had about eny most enuff trouble for&#xD;

if sumbody 'II have the carriage drew up I'll return to&#xD;

"Bless yer gizzard," says Aunt iluldy, "don't ye know&#xD;

"Well," says Spriggins, "I'll go hum and git our&#xD;

and then Spriggins he went out t6 the wagging and helpt&#xD;

stop and see ye to-morrer when I go hum from school, if&#xD;
you're will-in'." Thinks me, if he'd a leff out ~rhat he said&#xD;
about the egg-nogg and guayne to school wouldd a ben&#xD;
jest like what Sir Charles Bingley said to Amandy when&#xD;
she was guay-ne away from Missis Kilcorban's ball. So I&#xD;
giv him permission jest as Amandy did Sir Charles and&#xD;
then the driver druv off; and 'twas. a gret bi~ flamber-'&#xD;
gasted lumber wagging and it jolted most consairnedly, and&#xD;
I got knockt round from one side to t'other, and ouce in a~&#xD;
while I houndid up much as three or four foot into the air,&#xD;
and I tell ye I was all but did over when I got hum. I&#xD;
retired immejuntly to my compartment, and buy myself&#xD;
down in a cheer by the winder, jest as Amandy did. The&#xD;
woods, slivered by the beams of the moon that rode mojes~&#xD;
tic in the furmanent of stars, recalled to my rernemberation&#xD;
the vows of unchanngable regard that had ben utterated&#xD;

Arter a spell Aunt Huldy cum hum, and she cum in to&#xD;

"0 aunt," says I, "how could. ye be so oufeelin' as to&#xD;

So I took rather a small sized hunk and eat it, and&#xD;

ME.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE morning' arter the wedding' I got up the minnit I&#xD;
waked, cause Jabez Spriggins was a guayne to&#xD;
call on me on his way to school, and his school&#xD;
begun airlier'n mine so I hurried and drest me&#xD;
afore breckfust ~ drest very plain that morning' - dident&#xD;
put no riggin' whatsoever on my head, but I let my hair&#xD;
in its own natyve and glossy hue float over my shoulders, *&#xD;
but I couldent make it. quirl nun to save my gizzard,&#xD;
though I put it 'up in papers~and tin, and everything else;&#xD;
and I wondered , ~and do yit, what mad&amp;amp;'Amandy's hair al-&#xD;
ways hang in graceful stringlets over her shoulders; but I&#xD;
was detairmined ide let mine hang down for once whether&#xD;
or no. Then I put on my bhie caliber long..short, with a&#xD;
yeller skirt under it, hung my watch round my neck, and&#xD;
was just a guayne to put Philander in my pocket, when&#xD;
thinks me, fle look at it. fust. So I opened the box, and&#xD;
;lo and behold, the picter was entirely rubbed out - they'd&#xD;
finger it so much the night afore to Missis Wilkinses.&#xD;
~So I t6ok a pen and draw'd it over agin as nigh like t'other&#xD;
tOhildern of the Abby.&#xD;
&#xD;
as I could. Jest as Ide got it draw'd, Aunt.Huldy cum to&#xD;
the foot of' the stairs and hoilerd to me to cum to break-&#xD;
fust. So I condescended down, and as soon as ever Uncle&#xD;
Jonah see me, says he,&#xD;
"Land o' liberty! Permilly, what in the name of nater&#xD;
have ye got yer hair all raked down so for? it looks like&#xD;
the dragon!"&#xD;
"It don't nyther," says Aunt Huldy, says she, "it&#xD;
looks j~f1ike the young wimmin's in the novels - so you&#xD;
jest hold yer jaw."&#xD;
"~'Vell," says I, "-I don't ker what nobody' says about&#xD;
it; for it's fixed putty much as Amandy did bern, and she&#xD;
knowd what was what, and I don't think men has any biz-&#xD;
ness to meddle with wiminin's dress, specially them that&#xD;
don't know nothing' about nothing. "&#xD;
"I vum ! '~ says Uncle Jonah, says he, "Permilly's&#xD;
rather warm wife; can't ye give her .a little b*itterxnilk&#xD;
popto cool her off?"&#xD;
"Nun of yer sarce about buttermilk pop," says Aunt&#xD;
Huldy - so sayin', she gin him a grip, but he deluded her&#xD;
grasp, and grabbing' a hunk of short cake he cut out&#xD;
doors, and then he stuck his head into the winder, and&#xD;
says he,&#xD;
"Ye better both on ye take a chaw of tobacker out of'&#xD;
Milly's box. I reckon ittle callum yer minds." So sayin'&#xD;
he run off, and says aunt, says she, "That are's the pro-&#xD;
vokine~t creetur ever I see, and the wost on't is he never&#xD;
gits mad. I wish 'I had a little of Missis Peabody's grit.&#xD;
I tell ye I'd stir him up then he wouldn't darst to pester&#xD;
me so. Jest then I looked up and see Spriggins a cum-&#xD;
mm' over the bill. "There!" says I, "he's a cummin'."&#xD;

"I know it," says I, "and I don't know what to do&#xD;
with the creetur; Amandy always used Sir Charles Bingly&#xD;
well, but when she wouldn't have hiui he ceny most&#xD;
died."&#xD;
'.' Good landy!" says Aunt Huldy, "you don't mean to&#xD;
sairve 'him so I hope. He's a nice staidly young man as&#xD;
ever was, and his father's got a rael productive farm, and&#xD;
nary child in the world ony Jabez, and his parents set a&#xD;

"Yer granny's a dead creetur as much!" says I,&#xD;
"why, them are's my ostridge fethers sticking' out of his&#xD;

Putty soon he began knocking' to the 'door. "Y9ugo&#xD;

do.&#xD;
"No, no," says I, "that aint according' to etiquit -&#xD;
you- go, and'when he axes for me, you cram out and call&#xD;
me." So she ~went and ushered him in; and arter a spell&#xD;
'says he, "Where's that tire young woman that's here?".&#xD;
I was a waiting' in the pitching, and aunt she screamed out&#xD;
and, says she,"' Hullo, Milly! he's axed arter ye." I was&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
she went says she, "I'll know how next time." Then&#xD;
and says I to Spriggins, "Well, how did&#xD;
yerself last night arter nay departed?"&#xD;
middlin'," says he, "I got a putty good chance at&#xD;
the egg-nogg and stuff- but I don't like to see folks act&#xD;
they did. Arter the old peopic went huni the young&#xD;
on like sixty. The fellers they. got yer. os-&#xD;
and stuck 'em behind their ears, and caperd&#xD;
and hollered, 'Ilooraw for the yin/c of PQdUfllc!'&#xD;
the bride said she thought you'd or'to teach fainting'&#xD;
in your siminary, and the gears all on 'em did act&#xD;
consairnedly. I tried ever so long to git yer feathers, and&#xD;
couldn't. At last Johnson took 'em and laid 'em on the&#xD;
table, and as soon as I got a chance I ketcht' 'em unhe-&#xD;

"Well," said, I, "Pm unexpressibly obleejed to ye for&#xD;

to ye." So they all jumpt to git it and then they had&#xD;
a tussle which sho'd accompanate me evry one on&#xD;
'em wanted to go. At last says Jones (the doctor's&#xD;
student) says he, "Let Miss Ruggles take her choice."&#xD;
"Agreed," says they. So says I, " I can git along well&#xD;
enough without nobody, but se~in' ye're so anxious to go&#xD;
with me lie choose Mr. Johnson." When I said this the&#xD;
other fellers ript out a mess of wicked iswearin' words, and&#xD;
shook their fists at Johnson. "Now, gentlemen," says I,&#xD;
"I beseech on ye not to fight a dull with the favored swine,&#xD;
for I set store by all on ye, ony I admire Mr. Johnson be..&#xD;
cause he resembleates my Philander so much." So Johnson&#xD;
he gin me his arm and we started,~when Jones up and says&#xD;
he, "Miss Rugg'les will get her long-short as wet as muck&#xD;
Ile jest bring my surtoot and let her put it on." So he&#xD;
run and brung his surtoot. That Jones want a very putty&#xD;
appearing' young man, and I was real pervoked at him for&#xD;
givin' me the nastyfettity pill at the wedding' - but when&#xD;
he ~was. so consairned about me as for to offer me his sur-&#xD;
toot, thinks me, Lie surmount my nantipathy to him. So&#xD;
they all helpt me on with it and Johnson he buttoned it&#xD;
round me. "Now," says I, "what's to 1~e did? it's a&#xD;
master sight too long." Jones was wonderful tall, and his&#xD;
surtoot was a terrible long drab one with a number of capes&#xD;
sich as they wore in them days, and II was uncommon sl~ort&#xD;
and fairy-like in my bigger. -.&#xD;
"lie tell ye what," says Wilkins, "fle go behind and&#xD;
hold it up."&#xD;

"0 no, let me," says Tomson.&#xD;
"Now, gentleme~y" says I, "if it's so desirable to go&#xD;
long of me, s'pose one of ye holds up each skeart."&#xD;
"Thattle be charming, " says Wilkins. So they took&#xD;
holt, and we sot off, and Jones he stood in the door, and&#xD;
lookt at us. Whilst he ~as guayne along, says John5on&#xD;
says he, "0! the delightsome gratifaction of sheltering' the&#xD;
most heautiftillest of created creeturs from this outragin'&#xD;
storm!" " Ah, it's exquizzitte!" says Tomson. "It's&#xD;
the squintessence of pleasure," says Wilkins. And sich&#xD;
like ixpressions they made all along.&#xD;
Putty soon we arrove to the deacon's, and hem' quite&#xD;
late the scholars had all cum and sum on 'em was looking'&#xD;
out of the wonders, and when they see us they hulled to&#xD;
t'others and they all run to the wonders to look at us, and&#xD;
ye never heerd sicb a roaring' as they sot up in yer born&#xD;
days; and when we got into the house they all cam out on&#xD;
the stairs to see us - I tell ye I was awful mad to see 'em&#xD;
so unrespectful, and I should a let right into 'em and&#xD;
knock over a few if I hadent a concluded to chano'e&#xD;
monner of teaching' a little, for that morning' whilst I was&#xD;
a dressing' I happened to think how't I'd orto look into the&#xD;

tvactidly I s'pose they was dretful jelous. 0! what a&#xD;
terrible thing jealousy is! It distils pison into the most&#xD;
secret and unbeknown recessions of the heart, - it discom-&#xD;
poses and frusterates the finest affections of natur', and&#xD;
scatters 'the firebrands of confusion and pt~rgatory through...&#xD;
out society.&#xD;
Arter I was disbegaged from. the ~surtoot, says Johnson&#xD;
says he, "If the rain continys all day we'll ourn arter ye&#xD;
this afternoon."&#xD;
"0! don't pester yerselves," says I.&#xD;
"Pester us!" says Wilkins says he,: "why, it would&#xD;
be the most con~ummjt satisfication for us to' attend ye&#xD;
neverstandin' we should git wet to the backbone."&#xD;
"~0!" ~says Tomson, raisin' his eyes and layin' his&#xD;
hand on his bussom, "Ide be willing' to kiss yer footprints&#xD;
-'twould be exquizzite."&#xD;
"0 landy! '~ says I," that wouldent be woth while -&#xD;
ye may enjoy the felickity of imprintin' a kiss 'oii my lily&#xD;

I, "I intreat that ye won7t nun on ye. permit yerselves to&#xD;

it, and put it back agin ~- and~ then makin' a~ low eurchy I&#xD;
perceeded. up chamber, and as I went along I could hear&#xD;
all the fellers a syin'.&#xD;
When I went' into the school-room the gears was all&#xD;
setting' down looking' jest as if they suspected a knockin'-~&#xD;

and it must be on account of my extrornary strictness, for&#xD;
I can't think of nothing' else that could a had an attendance&#xD;
to dimminnish my scholars, - ~o I sha'n't giv nobody. no&#xD;
murder 'casion to complain of my stairnness." Ye never see&#xD;
creeturs act as my scholars did that day cause I didn't jaw&#xD;
'em nun - more'n forty times I was on the pint of coffin'&#xD;
sum on 'em; but then Ide happen to think -~s6 I let 'em&#xD;
go on jest as they pleased.. In the afternoon when the&#xD;
little ones had went out, and the big ones was a painting ,&#xD;
and I was givin', Glorianny Stokes sum coi~structions con-&#xD;
sairnin' the ~icter she was a copying , ('twas Gineral P~~t-&#xD;
nam ridin' down the mountain' -~-- an uncommon splendid&#xD;
and.highly finished picter,) Philindy Ann Eliggins hollered&#xD;
out, -&#xD;
* "Do look, Miss Ruggles."&#xD;
"Timothy Titus!" says I, "if that are aint my retinow&#xD;
a cuinmin," - and sure as~ creation, 'twas Johnson, and&#xD;
Wilkins, and Tomson, a cummin' with a hoss to take me&#xD;
hum. The gearls all snorted out. a laffin', and says&#xD;
Mirandy Peabody, says she, "I never see sich a bony,&#xD;
scrawny hoss, in my life."&#xD;
* "Shet up!".says I, "it's a spirited, fiery steed."&#xD;
Then I stuck my head out of the winder, and says I,&#xD;
"Gentler~en, what for did ye cum so airly? yer altogether&#xD;
tew punctable, - but ye may cum in and visit my siminary&#xD;
if ye want to." So. they was a cummin', and says I, "Ye'd&#xD;
best tie up the boss fust, -2mabby 'II he'll run away."&#xD;
~ "Run away!" says Drusilly Potter "he wouldn't run&#xD;
away if ye should jam him with a red-hot poker from now&#xD;
to next never - it's father's old Billy.; he's game legged&#xD;
and eeny most blind, -- much as a body can do to make&#xD;
him stir at all."&#xD;
&#xD;
Well, they cum in and sot down, and says I, "Now,&#xD;
gears, don't let yer attention be extracted by these ere&#xD;
young men it's very improper,," So they all on 'em&#xD;
kept on painting , ony jest Drusilly Potter, and she kept her&#xD;
head out of the winder and talked to the old hoss Billy all&#xD;
the time - she was a~ terrible hawbuck. The hoss he&#xD;
knowd her voice and he begun a snortin' and ye never&#xD;
heerd sich a consairnid rackit in yer born days. I was&#xD;
dretful 'shamed, for the fellers must a thought strange on't;&#xD;
but I didn't want to jaw her, for wouldn'tt a ben like&#xD;
Amandy. The young men egzamined the painting's and&#xD;
admired them amazin'ly, and putty soon I hollered to the&#xD;
little gearls to cum in, and 'twas ever so long~re they&#xD;
obeydid the summonses. Finally they cum and sa#s&#xD;
I, "Ye may put on yer things, for I don't want to keep.&#xD;
these ere gentlemen waiting. " But the fellers said they&#xD;
waiit in no hurry, and begged on me to continny my con-&#xD;
structiQns so I heerd 'em spell, and then the fellers&#xD;
wanted to hear 'em read; so IL tell'd 'em to git their En -&#xD;
lish Readers, and they did. They read in the poetry in&#xD;
the afternoon this time; I told 'em to read the~ peece be-.&#xD;
ginnin', "Dear Chole, while the boosy crowd "- 'twas a&#xD;
gret favorite of mine, and I read it beautiful -~ I always&#xD;
read a vairse fust for each on 'em, to show 'em how. The&#xD;
gentlemen was inraptered with the read~n'. Then I tell'd&#xD;
em to put on their things and make their manners so&#xD;
they did;~ and says I, "Siminary's out "*- and they all&#xD;
cared out.&#xD;
So I begun to git-ready, and the fellers went down and&#xD;
brung up the old surtoot.&#xD;
"It don't rain," says I, "I han't no 'casion for that&#xD;
are."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8269-00000052"/>&#xD;
"But," says Johnson, "it's' damp, and we're afraid&#xD;
ye'Il ketch yer death a cold without it." So they put it&#xD;
on, and they exerted me down stairs, and resisted me to&#xD;
surmount the hoss, and there in the medder aside the&#xD;
house was all my scholars a waiting' for to see me go.&#xD;
Johnson he led the hoss; and Wilkins and Tomson walkt&#xD;
on 'each' side on't, and in that sittyation we went clean hum&#xD;
and ev'ry once 'in a while the h2ss would stop still, and&#xD;
Tomson, (tender-hearted young man,) inside of thumping'&#xD;
on him, would giv his tail a jerl~ and make him go agin.&#xD;
All the gentlemen kept a payin' on me complements all the&#xD;
way about my. majestic appearance and everybody stared&#xD;
at us; but nobody couldn't ~ay a word - they was all&#xD;
speechless with adinireation. I must a presented an iinpo-&#xD;
sin' appearance with the gret long surtoot a hanging' over&#xD;
the bosses back, and my hair a floating' over my shoulders;&#xD;
but I was quite uncomfortablee, for 'twas dretftzl' warm, and&#xD;
the si~irtoot was dretful heavy, . and the sun beet down&#xD;
awful hot, so't my ,phiziogermy was all kivered with swet-.&#xD;
spiration.&#xD;
Well, we got hum. I unmounted, and Johnson giv the&#xD;
boss a slap, and he limped off to Potter's. "Walk in,&#xD;
gentlemen," says I. So they all cum in, and desisted me&#xD;
off with the surtoot, and I opened the square room door,&#xD;
and rushered 'em in. " Bcseat yerselves," says L Then&#xD;
I .we'nt up chamber and arranged my dress; wiped the&#xD;
swetspiration off my face; done up my hair,, it felt so&#xD;
warm; stuck a couple of ostridge feathers in my head, anc~&#xD;
condescended to the square room, where I found Aunt&#xD;
Huldy and Mr. Jabez Spriggins, and his mother, an old~&#xD;
erly woman, of oncommdn good' understanding , and very&#xD;
agreeable, but very nigh-sighted and considerable deef'; ~o't&#xD;
&#xD;
she didn't appear as much, struck with my looks as she&#xD;
otherways would a ben. She'd ben there all the arter-&#xD;
noon, and Jabez stopt on his way hum from school; they'd&#xD;
ben a setting in the pitching Iong of Aunt iluldy.&#xD;
"Yer sarvent," says Jabez, "I make ye acquainted&#xD;
with my mother.~~&#xD;
"how do ye dew?" says I, but she didn't look off her&#xD;
nittin' work. So Jabez' he hollered right in her ear,&#xD;
"Miss Ruggles axes ye how ye dew?" '~ Miss&#xD;
says she, "well, why couldn't she speak up so's to be&#xD;
beerd?" So I went and sot down nigh by her and&#xD;
yelled out as loud as ever I could,&#xD;
"Yer considerable hard of hearing , ain't ye Mi~sis Sprig-&#xD;
gins?" "Hard of hearing " says she, "yer mistaken;&#xD;
my hearing's as good as ever 'twas, ony I can't hear whis-.&#xD;
penn' no more'n anybody else that hadn't alwas ben used&#xD;
to't; if they'd talk as they did when I was young I could&#xD;
= bear well enuff." Well, I talkt to Missis Spriggins a&#xD;
spell, and she seemed to take quite a notion to me, 'cause&#xD;
I hollered so loud - said I talkt as they did in old times.&#xD;
Byrne by tea was reddy, and aunt cum in and called us&#xD;
out so we went into the kitctiing, and says aunt, "Set&#xD;
by." So we sot down to the table, and we had punkin&#xD;
pie, and apple-sass, and short cake, and nuteakes, and&#xD;
sweet cake, and pickled cowQumbers, and sage cheese.&#xD;
"' Missis Spriggins," says Aunt Huldy, "is yer tea&#xD;
agreeable? "&#xD;
"Yis," says she.&#xD;
"Jabez is yourn?" . " Fust rate," says he.&#xD;
"Mr. Wilkins, is yourn?" "Excellent," says he.&#xD;
'~ Mr. Johnson is yourn?" "Delishus," says he.&#xD;
Mr. Tomson is yourn?"&#xD;

"Exquizzite," says he.&#xD;
"Well now," continyd she, "do eat, and don't be&#xD;

eat putty hearty but me - I ony took a dish of tea, and&#xD;
didn't eatnotbin'..&#xD;
Putty soon arter tea old Spriggins cum in a wagon arter&#xD;
his wife. Aunt and uncle went in the kit~hing and I was&#xD;
alone with four interesting' young men: so says I, "Gen.&#xD;
tlemen, what good do ye spose it's a guayne to do ye to&#xD;
take arter me? I'm undessolubly united in the bonds of&#xD;
affection on Philander; I can't incurridge nary on ye."&#xD;
They all put their honkerchers to their eyes - Spriggins&#xD;
he lookt dretfully pleased, and says he, "Ye don't mean&#xD;
me tew, 'cause ye ain't a guayne to giv me my anser till&#xD;
I've larut that are you know what, and thattle be putty&#xD;

"0!" says Wilkins says he, "don't put a momenta-&#xD;

Says Tomson, " Don't break my heart by sayin' ye&#xD;
'won't be mine."&#xD;
Says Johnson,' " Don't, for goodness sake drive me to&#xD;
desperation. and discomboberation by sich soul-diatractin'&#xD;

"My gracious, Mr. Johnsqn," says 1, "how much&#xD;

'there was three fellers felt bad, them are three coilidge&#xD;

Arter they'd went I went to take a walk, and I rumbled&#xD;

He was married a week ago."&#xD;

OLD SONG.&#xD;
&#xD;
L, the anteceedin' week of things went on&#xD;
~      urty much as they did the proceeding ; but a&#xD;
{Saturday an event conspired that changed my&#xD;
destination. When I went hum from my sim-&#xD;
mary, lo and behold, there was a letter from Podunk for&#xD;
me; and I opened it and found 'twas from father - here's&#xD;
a subscription on't:&#xD;
"DORTER MILLY Ourn hunt right strait off you yer&#xD;
marm is to the pint of death. She was took last, week with&#xD;
a dretful cramp in her side -~awfal crick in her back - blind&#xD;
headache and terrible cold feet. She's talkt about her&#xD;
Milly ever sen she was took, and wanted to have us send&#xD;
for ye at fust, but as I reckoned she'd git up agin aforo&#xD;
long - (cause she's ben took so a number of times ~nd&#xD;
never died afore) I thought 'twant best to send for ye,&#xD;
we've had sich peccable times ser~ ye went off; but she got&#xD;
wus and wus, and now we don't have no idee she'll git&#xD;
well - so ye jest cum hum as quick as ye can, and dew&#xD;
make up yer mii4 to be of sum service to as when ye git&#xD;
here.,                  Yer daddy,&#xD;
"NADAB RUG~LEs."&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, thinks me, my exhibition 's all knockt in the head&#xD;
- (for yer must know I was perjectin to have an exhibi-&#xD;
tion in my seminary) and I mustent think of nothing' now&#xD;
only my beloved parent - so I buy myself on the bed&#xD;
,~aiid jackelated, "0 mairciful creation! support and&#xD;
strenken me in this tryin hour, and enable me to cumfort&#xD;
my onfortinate mother af'ore she dies." Jest as Arnandy&#xD;
did when she heard of her father's illness. Then I thought&#xD;
Ide go into highsterics. So 1 begun kicking' and squallin'&#xD;
and rollin' my eyes consairnedly. Aunt Huldy she heerd&#xD;
ine and she cum up.&#xD;
"Grandfer grievous!" says she, "what's to pay?"&#xD;
"0 dear si~z!" says I, "read that are letter and ye&#xD;
won't wonder at me. for my everlasting' dear mother isent&#xD;
suspected to live from* one day to t'other."&#xD;
"You don't~ say so," says she. So she took and read&#xD;
it, and says she, "Ile go hum with ye, for I must see&#xD;
Viny once more afore she dies; jump up, Milly; we'll git&#xD;
reddy right off; and go in the stage when it cuins along&#xD;
this evening "&#xD;
"Onfeelin' woman]" says I, "how can ye tell me to&#xD;
git up when I've got the highstericks so owfully!"&#xD;
"I know it," says she, ~' poor child ! but then if ye&#xD;
don't git over it the stage will go along afore yer reddy -&#xD;
and don't ye remember how Amandy hurried to git to her&#xD;
rather when she heerd he was sick." So I hopt up in the&#xD;
most agonizing' state of condition and begun to giL reddy.&#xD;
I put on my black rottenette gownd, and a black bomba-&#xD;
zeen long shawl that mother gin 5e, Qne she wore when&#xD;
she was in mourning' for Grandfer Hogobone then I tied'&#xD;
a black ribbon round my bunnit, and stuck one amazing'&#xD;
long black ostridge father in't. Then I stuift all the rest&#xD;

of my things in my chist. and lockt it up. Whilst T was&#xD;
* fixin', Aunt Huldy went out and told Uncle Jonah, and&#xD;
purty soon they cum in, and says uncle, says he,&#xD;
"WhyMilly, it's all nonsense~ for yer aunt to go hum&#xD;
with ye."&#xD;
- "I guess lie go for all you - so there, now," says aunt.&#xD;
"Well," says uncle, "T shant giv ye no money to go&#xD;
with. Ye never hear of any of y~r relations bein' sick&#xD;
but what ye want to go and see 'em die, and cut a worth&#xD;
to the funeral, and ye might better stay hum and take care&#xD;

"Mighty family!" says Aunt Huldy, "ony one old&#xD;

this inawlancolly ciision ~I wish ye'd retire to the kitchenary&#xD;

"Alas 1 our darling' teacher's gone,  - /&#xD;
That's why we put these black gowuds on;&#xD;
We can't submit to't tho' we must;&#xD;
It seems as if our very hcarts would bust."&#xD;
Arter supper the stage cum along, and Uncle Jonah run&#xD;
out and hulled, "Pas~enger for Podunk;" so they druv&#xD;
up, and we all went out, and whilst the driver was helping'&#xD;
Uncle Jonah put my chist into't, I huy my arms round&#xD;
Aunt Huldy and kist her agin and agin, exclamigatin',&#xD;
"Farewell belovedest, darlinest Aunt Huldy may all&#xD;
the biessins of Heaven be condescended upon yer." Then&#xD;
I stretch out oiie hand and had t'other on my heart, and&#xD;
looking' round me with a heavy sythe, says I thus: "Adool&#xD;
sylvaific shades of. Higgins Patent! no longer will ye giv&#xD;
a syluin to the fair Permily. Ad~oo! sweet umbraggious&#xD;
shady grove where I parted with Philander - no more will&#xD;
my fairy form wander amonkst yer exciudid shades, to&#xD;
court the musses and think on my distant swine -II bid&#xD;
ye an interminable farewell !"&#xD;
There was three gentlemen in the stage, and they stared&#xD;
at me consairnedly, and says one on 'em to Aunt Huldy,&#xD;
"Is the young woman derangedd"&#xD;
"Deraunged! no;" says she, " ony she's rather&#xD;
smarter'n common folk~."&#xD;
Well, I got in and we druv off. 0! if there is a&#xD;
minnit in this subernary state of egsistence, when the sad&#xD;
and sorrerful sperrit fells as if it wouldent giv teppence&#xD;
for all ~creation, 'tis when we part with finds. It felt so&#xD;
then - so I huv my head languidiously over onto the&#xD;
shoulder of the man that sot aside of me, and bust into a&#xD;
simmuhaneous hood of tears.&#xD;
Arter Ide recovered a little I raised my droopin' head&#xD;

&#xD;
and Io~kt round and I never see tew surprisder lookin'&#xD;
ereetms than the men that sot opposite of' me. They&#xD;
opened their eyes as big as sarcers and begun whisperin'&#xD;
about me but the one next to me didn't say a ~r6rd, So&#xD;
I lookt round at him and good gracious~.! he lookt so much&#xD;
like Philander, (ony sum older,) that I utterated a percin'&#xD;
skreik and tumbled prostracious on~ the bottom of the&#xD;
stage. They all jumpt up and resisted me to rise and arter&#xD;
I was beseated, says I, "Gentlemen, mabby you think&#xD;
strange of me, and for fear you should entertain oranious&#xD;
impressions regarding' me, lie tell ye my history, if ye'd&#xD;
like to hear it." They all said they'd like to hear it wonder-&#xD;
fully so I teild 'em the hull I've telld my readers; only&#xD;
I couldn't remember all the poetry; but I had a coppy of&#xD;
my Ode to Memory in my work pocket, and I took that&#xD;
out and read it to 'em. The young man that set aside of&#xD;
me said he never heerd enny thing equal to it; but the&#xD;
other men didn't s~iy a word, and nary on 'em didn't speak&#xD;
to me agin - they was elderly men and uncommon ruff&#xD;
looking , but otherr one was a rael slick looking' feller -he&#xD;
telld me he lived in Utica; and like most of the resides&#xD;
of that extensive and anncient city he was uncommon gin-&#xD;
teel in his appearance, and refined in his monners. Well,&#xD;
purty soon we arrive at Utica, and the stage druv up to&#xD;
the' stage-hoQse, and there was a lot of men standing' round&#xD;
and when the young man got out, there was one run o t&#xD;
~monkst from 'em and shook hands with him; so I poked&#xD;
riiy head out t~ giL a better sight on him, and as true as crea-&#xD;
tion, 'twas Philander! my long-lost Philander. He was&#xD;
considerb]e altered, and I should thought 'twas Johnson&#xD;
if he hadent a had on the same green coat With a black&#xD;
velvet collar he had on when he paid his distresses to me;&#xD;
&#xD;
but there was no mistake; so I jumpt out of the stage and&#xD;
run towers him. The men all gin ~ay for me and I rushed&#xD;
ahead exclamigatin, "0 Philander! my own darling' Phil..&#xD;
ander! Heaven ~has at last restored you to your mourning'&#xD;
but faithful Permilly."&#xD;
So sayin' I buy my arms round him and ceny most had&#xD;
a highateric fit. There was ever ~so many young men&#xD;
standing' round, and amongst 'em I see Wilkins and Tom~.&#xD;
son, and they all hoorawd. Philander, instid of returning'&#xD;
my enraptured caresses, Iookt rael mad, and didn't know&#xD;
what to do. At last the young man that cum in the stttge&#xD;
with me says he, ~"The young woman's crazy- she's&#xD;
taken my brother to be sumbody else;" and says Philan.&#xD;
der, " We'd better take her into the house till the stage is&#xD;
reddy." So he and his brother led me in and sot me down&#xD;
on a sofy~ and all the other fellers hollered arter. Philan-&#xD;
der and his brother whispered together t~ spell, and then&#xD;
Philander went out, motioning' to t'other fellers to accompa~&#xD;
nate him. Arter they'd all went ony Philander's brother&#xD;
and me, he cum to me and says he, "Miss Iluggles;"&#xD;
says I, "Hay!" says he, "I've got suthin to tell ye,&#xD;
thattle no doubt make ye feel rusher bad, and tho' I'd&#xD;
rather have an iron spike druv thro' me than to communi-&#xD;
cate sich a piece of intelligence, yit it's my duty to do it,&#xD;
and if II don't ye'll find it out sum time or other."&#xD;
"Dew tell ,". says I, "my curiosity is rung up to the&#xD;
biggest pitch - dew tell me."&#xD;
"Well," says he, "if I must I must--- Philander's&#xD;
married!"&#xD;
If a thousand muskits had ben fired at my head, and a&#xD;
million baggeinets run through my~ body, I shouldent a ben&#xD;
more bethundersf~ruck nor no nigher killed than I was that&#xD;

minnit. I yelled out as loud as ever I could, a~id then I&#xD;
got up and took off my bunnit and laid it on the ~table, and'&#xD;
begun tearing' my hair most awfully, and ravin' and&#xD;
screemin' the wost way, ~o't all the folks in the house cum&#xD;
running' in to* see what was the matter. Arter Ide got&#xD;
coinplectly desausted I s~t down and gin vent to my scorer&#xD;
in heart-spflttifl' groans~ and sythes, and thinks me, how&#xD;
would Amandy acted if she'd heern Lord Mortimer was&#xD;
married? There's no tellin'. But I know how she acted&#xD;
when she heerd he was a guayne to be.. She lost her&#xD;
appetite and growd as thin as a rail; but didn't say a&#xD;
word about it to nobody - tho' she took on when she got&#xD;
alone. And thinks me, like enuff Philander's torrannical&#xD;
father has ben a makin' of him git i~iarried agin his inclina-&#xD;
tion, jest as Lord Mortimer's father was a guayne to make&#xD;
him.. So says I, "Did his cruel father impel him to git&#xD;
married agin his inclination?" and 1 lookt'round to where&#xD;
Philander's brother sot, and lo and behold, he want there.&#xD;
I spose he was so overcum by my suffering  he couldn't&#xD;
stand it, and so cleared out, and* I never see no more on&#xD;
him nor Philander nyther from that day to this. I han't&#xD;
no doubt but what Philander had been conducted to believe&#xD;
that I was onfaithful to him. Lord Mortirner wouldn't a&#xD;
wiped his old shoes on Lady Euphrasia Sutherland if he&#xD;
hadent a posed Amandy was unfaithful no more would-&#xD;
&amp;amp;ntiPhilander a married anybody else if he hadn't a posed&#xD;
Ide forget him, and ide be willing to bet a boss that John-&#xD;
son and Wilki~is and Tomeon bad been a lyin' to him about&#xD;
me; 'cause they wanted me themselves. Well, arter&#xD;
thinking' on't all over I got up and. dun up my hair, and put&#xD;
on my bunnit, and tho' there was more'n fox~ty {olks - men,&#xD;
wimmin, and children, axin' of me questions - I dident&#xD;
&#xD;
anser 'em nor tell 'em what aided me, but arter Ide got&#xD;
fixt I went out and stood by the door till t'other stage got&#xD;
reddy to go, and then I got in' aud huv my head agin the&#xD;
back side of the stage and shot. up my eyes and didn't&#xD;
open 'em agin whilst t'other passengers was a gittin' in,.&#xD;
nor for, quite a spell arterwards: but there I sot a ponder-&#xD;
in', and my ruminations was the most distressing' I ever&#xD;
experienced in my born days, and whilst I was a setting' in&#xD;
that persition I composed sum very mournful stauzys, and&#xD;
I thought Ide write 'em off so I opend my eyes and I see&#xD;
tw~s considerable daik, so't I couldn't ede the folks that&#xD;
was in the stage, ony so fur as to see that they was all&#xD;
men folks, and I was the ony shema~e in the stage. So&#xD;
says I, "Gentlemen; I. want to write down sum poetry&#xD;
and I don't see how line to do it, it's so dark."&#xD;
"0!" says one on 'em says he, "I can write as well&#xD;
in the dark as I can without a light. fle write it for ye if&#xD;
ye'll tell me as I go long."&#xD;
'lie be obleejed to ye to do it," says I: so I gin him&#xD;
my pencil hind a piece of paper, and he took his hat and&#xD;
writ on top oi't, (me tellin' on him a line to. once) the&#xD;
follerin':&#xD;
ON A LAMENT.&#xD;
Did you ever see Philander?&#xD;
0! he was a charming' swine;&#xD;
He was tall, and he was slender;&#xD;
He was honsome; he was mine.&#xD;
To a maid he took a notion,&#xD;
She his love did soon return,&#xD;
And while he was on the oshun&#xD;
She believed his heart was hem.&#xD;
He Intended for. to marry;&#xD;
But alas! his mind he ohaunged&#xD;
Now she's ravin' like old Harry;~&#xD;

"That's all,"~says I, "noW giv it to me."&#xD;
"0 no I" says he, "you must allow me to read it to&#xD;

kn~w'd who 'twas: "Land of' liberty!" says I, "Mr.&#xD;

"Egzackly," says he, "and I vow I believe this is&#xD;
Miss Ruggles- IL dident know ye afc~re - and here's Mr.&#xD;

"This is strangee" says Johnson," how on airth have&#xD;

"Purty question for you to ax, you tarnal wretch," says&#xD;
IL, 'shaking my fist in his face.&#xD;
"What have we done ?"' says Tomson.&#xD;
"Dun?" says IL. "Haint ye ben the means of dashin'&#xD;
the dish of felicity from my lips? -~- Hlaint ye undermined&#xD;
me in the affections of Philander? Haint it ben thro'&#xD;
your instrumentality that he's went, and married another,&#xD;
and left me to uncornboundid dispare?"&#xD;
"0 yer mistaken!" says they all to once.&#xD;
"I aint nyther," says. I so I atuft my fingers in my&#xD;
ears and held 'em so ever so lono~. At last Tomson&#xD;
begun to read the poitry he'd writ down for me out loud,&#xD;
and when he'd red it the sung it to a Methodist tune.&#xD;
&#xD;
Toinson he lined it as they do in meeting . So I took my&#xD;
fingers out of my ears to listen to 'em, and says Johnson,&#xD;
"Music hath charms to sooth a savid~ge! I tho't you'd get&#xD;
over it."&#xD;
"I hadn't got over it nyther," says I so I stuck my.&#xD;
bead out of the winder and hollered "Murder! murder!"&#xD;
as loud as ever I could yell. Well the houses they was&#xD;
dretfully skirt, and took off as tight as ever they cDuld&#xD;
pull. The driver he tried to hold 'em in, and kept a&#xD;
hollering' "hoe!" but they went faster and faster, and&#xD;
purty soon they went tearing' down a hill and .huv the&#xD;
stage right over; and we all cum tumblin' out ~n massy&#xD;

"Unpossible!" says all three of the fellers, "you&#xD;

"Hold yer jaw," says I, "yer a set of thundering' mean&#xD;

"Well," says the driver, "if ye did ye wouldn't have&#xD;
to do it, seem' it's aireddy arranged in' that persition."&#xD;
When the driver said that, the fellers all laift consairn-&#xD;

"0, lawful suz I" says I,"' ye all begin to laff, now&#xD;

dressin' the driver)~ "jest take off my chist, for lime a&#xD;

"~yeJl~n't no ehist." Sosays I to the man, "Mister, I&#xD;
wish ye'd let yer boy there go up to Utica and get my&#xD;

driver up 'and says he, "Don't ye dew it; she han't got no&#xD;

"Ye lie like split," says I, "I'm a young woman of&#xD;

it want for all these ere sircumstences my own individdyal&#xD;
extinction would be enuff to skewer me the steam and ad-&#xD;

"Well," says the driver, " ye've got to pay as much&#xD;
damrnage as if ye went to Durrup" So I' took out my.&#xD;
puss and paid him and they druv off and I went into the&#xD;
house; and says I to the man and woman, "That are&#xD;
driver haint no reason to think I'm derannged, ony cause&#xD;
I wouldent trail with' the company he's carrying , and I do&#xD;
boseech on ye to send arter my chist to Utica, for it's got&#xD;
all my notions in't."&#xD;
"Well,"~says the man, "it's pitch dark now -.--- I can't&#xD;
let JToky~go to-night, but mabby I will to-Inorrer."&#xD;
"Well, then," says I, "jest give giv me a compart-&#xD;
ment for I want to go into a~ state of retiracy."&#xD;
"Give' ye what?" says the woman.&#xD;
"Why, a room to sleep in you," says I.'&#xD;
"Well," says she, "ye'll have to sleep "with Zady, for&#xD;
the schoolmaster's a boarding' here this week, and he's got&#xD;
the spare bed, and he's gone to bed now." So she took a&#xD;
lontern and went up chamber and I hollered arter, and she&#xD;
rushered me into a room that was in considerable of a&#xD;
condition - there was a half a looking gla~s, an QId three&#xD;
lcgg~d cheer, and an old shaken' table that would tumble&#xD;
over if ye lookt at it~hard; and in the corner was a trundle&#xD;
bed and a gret fat' gearl asleep on't a snorin' the wost&#xD;
Way.&#xD;
"Good woman," says I. "My name's Missis Hitchins,"&#xD;
says she.&#xD;
"Well, Missis Hitchins," says I, "ye may make yer&#xD;
disappearance." So she went off, and I took the lontern&#xD;
and went up and took a realizing' sense of the trundle bed;&#xD;

&#xD;
and besides the snorin' of the fleshy gearl, the uncommon&#xD;
narrowness of the trundle bed was sich ~s to. render it on-&#xD;
possible tQ repose there: so thinks me, I'll set up all night.&#xD;
So I turned the old cheer over and sot down on't, and be-&#xD;
gun to ponderate ;-~and thinks me, how much my sitty~tion&#xD;
is like Amandy's when she stopt to old Byrnes ilamber-&#xD;
gasted cottidge. What a pity she di4ent have my genyus&#xD;
for makin' poetry - what an interesting' account she'g a gin&#xD;
of her misfortins; but taint everybody that has a natural&#xD;
~     genyus for't, and if it don't cum natural there's no use in&#xD;
tryin' - they bought as well try to make a univairse as&#xD;
to try to' make poetry without beela' naturally gifted that&#xD;
way and seem' I've got' sich gret poeticle talents Ide&#xD;
or'to improve 'em, and certainly the sollein sittyation line&#xD;
placed in to-night should or'to inspire me with a wonder"&#xD;
ful frenzy for composin'. So I lookt in my ridicule and&#xD;
there want no paper there.&#xD;
Just then I heerd suinbody in the contigruous room ut-&#xD;
terate the terriblest percin' skreek I ever heerd in my born&#xD;
days. So thinks me, sr~mbody's dyin' or sumbody's mur-&#xD;
deAn', sumbody; and hem' indeed with uncommon cur-.&#xD;
ridge, I ketcht the lontern and run in there - but there&#xD;
want no noise nor nobody' there ony sumbody in bed; so I&#xD;
Went up to the bed to ~ee whether the occerpyer was dead&#xD;
or alive - and lo and behold, there was a very interesting'&#xD;
looking . young man asleep there, and thinks me he had the&#xD;
nightmare when he yelled so no doubt he was a dream-.&#xD;
in' of his own sorrers and misfortins, for I knowd from his&#xD;
looks that he want a strannger to greef. 1k had on a red.&#xD;
~nightcap with a tossil on top, and a number of holes in't&#xD;
thro' which his dark hair was pokin' in graceful neglitude.&#xD;
0! (solliquized I,) greef has did its w9rk on that are&#xD;
&#xD;
long thin nose and turned up the tip on't with continyl&#xD;
sobbin'! greef has undoubtedly drawd down the corners&#xD;
of that are mouth, and dreams of unrelentin' ennemys&#xD;
pursuing' of ye has certainly skairt ye to sidh an alarming&#xD;
degree as to make 'yer ears start out so and bust them.&#xD;
holes in yer nightcap! peace to yer ashes, mournin' swine.&#xD;
So sayin' I turned round to go out, when I obsairved sum&#xD;
paper lyin' on the table. So I reckoned Ide help myself&#xD;
to a sheet on't to write sum poetry on; but seem' an ink-.&#xD;
stand and pei~ there thinks nje, lie write here cause. this&#xD;
ere table don't shake so as t'other does. So I drawd up a&#xD;
cheer and sot down, and my medifkations resulted in the&#xD;
follerin' confusion:&#xD;
Who knows but what I'm setting' nigh&#xD;
To sum extinguished stranger,&#xD;
That from his hum was forced to fly&#xD;
O'er this wide world a ranger.&#xD;
Mabby his father was onkind,&#xD;
And tried to make him wed&#xD;
Sum geari that wasent to his mind,&#xD;
And so from hum he fled.&#xD;

made me last night - and that poetry! Jimmini, it's fine!&#xD;
I couldn't rest till ide writ an anser to 'it - for line a poit&#xD;

last night."&#xD;
"But," says I, interruption' him, "ye said how't ye&#xD;
writ an anser to my poiin. II should like to see it."&#xD;
So he put his hand in his pocket and took out a fol&amp;amp;d&#xD;
paper containing' 45 amazing' putty vairses, and tho' it&#xD;
would take tew much time to cop~y 'em all, I can't help&#xD;
substractiri' a few on 'em. Arter guayne on to say how't&#xD;
he want asleep when I went into his room, but ony "per~&#xD;
tending' for to sleep," he continnys in the follerin manner:&#xD;
"0! slob a face I never see&#xD;
Sence Ion airth was born!&#xD;
'Twas brightest noonday's sun to me,&#xD;
With lflusbing hues of morn.&#xD;
"And then I seen you starin' round,&#xD;

Sumthin' it had lost.&#xD;
"And then i~iy pen I s~ez~ you take,&#xD;

&#xD;
And then set down an for to make&#xD;
That poetry so dear.&#xD;
"And o'er the'sheet the pen you drew,&#xD;
In rhymink fury 'dashing,&#xD;
And from yer eyes the idees flew,&#xD;
Like lightning bugs a flashing."&#xD;
Here comes in a number of stanzys about Mister&#xD;
Shakespeare, rollin' frenzy, &amp;amp;o.; and then he goes on,&#xD;
"And when you'd got it writ, you took&#xD;
And put it in my 1'ike-..&#xD;
That jewel of a ciphering book-&#xD;

"Dy day I read that arithmetic,&#xD;

"My streekid sky's ben black and blue,&#xD;
A world of botheratlon,&#xD;
As you have ben, so I've ben through&#xD;
A sight of tribulation."&#xD;
Then he goes on to tell about his sorrers - ho~'t he'd&#xD;
ben in love a number of'timesand always got the mitten,&#xD;
and so finally made up his mind not t~ try no more&#xD;
but taint woth while to subscribe that part, as there's 18&#xD;
vairses on't. So he contains,&#xD;
"Alit Shakespeare says,.-"&#xD;
(I spose this Mr. Shakespeare's sum intimit frind of'&#xD;
'hissen.)&#xD;
"' Ab I Shakespeare says, and Shakespeare knew,&#xD;

and II and the master was left alone together,- and we con-&#xD;
~ vairsed about things in general, and I discovered that Mr.&#xD;
Gorum was a young man of uncommon bright immagin&#xD;
nation and highly cultivated mind, * I axed him to write&#xD;
me an ode on the death &amp;amp;f my mother.&#xD;
"Is yer mother dead?" says he.&#xD;
"No," says I, "but I suspect she will be by the time&#xD;
I get hum." So sayin' I put my honkercher to my eyes,&#xD;
and was dretfully overcum for a spell.&#xD;
Bymeby Hoky arrive with my chist, and as I was a&#xD;
guayne out in the stage that evening' I reckoned I wouldn't&#xD;
have it carried up chamber. So I took out my kee and&#xD;
unlocked it, and took out sick articles as I contended to&#xD;
put' on, and went up into Zady'8 room and arranged my&#xD;
apparril.&#xD;
Deem' a very warm dayl tho't I wouldn't wear no bun-&#xD;
nit to nieetin'. So I done up my auburn treasis with my&#xD;
bigh-toppt comb, tied my six black oshidge feathers together&#xD;
with 'a black ribbing and stuck 'em in my head - ye know&#xD;
I had on my black rottenette gownd - wells I rolled 'up&#xD;
the sleeves to make 'em. look ~short, and put on my long&#xD;
black cambriek gloves, then ]~4~iv my black 'long shawl&#xD;
round my neck and pined it down on one holder with a&#xD;
black bow' with tew eends to't much as a yard and a half&#xD;
'long, then I loo~t the skeart of my gQwnd up on one side&#xD;
and pined a black bow on't and my 'dress was completed,&#xD;
and certingly if ever a creetur lookt interesting' I did, that&#xD;
minnit in my mournin' habileations.&#xD;
Arter I was drest I condesendid, and I never see a sur-&#xD;
prisdex~' creetur than the master was - he w~s quite over-&#xD;
cum' with admireation, and declared that he never see a&#xD;
more charinin' appearance than what I ~ereented all in&#xD;

black. Well he went into the buttery and brung me a&#xD;
piece of cheese on a f9rk, and then he went to the cubberd&#xD;
and fetched me a wonderful long nutcake on another fork.&#xD;
Then he helpt himself and arter we'd eat 'em he said 'twas&#xD;
time to be guayne. So I took my parrysol and we lockt&#xD;
ar~ns and off we sot for meeting, and I don't bleeve that&#xD;
tew more interesting' beeins ever prerambleated the scrub..&#xD;
urbs of New Hartford afore oi~ sen.' Mr. Gorum was&#xD;
drest with the biggest taste; he had on a bug-tailed yaller&#xD;
thin coat and nankeen trowsis. Well, we walkt purty&#xD;
slow and when we got to meetiii' the folks had most on&#xD;
~em 'arrove there, and as he walkt up the broad ile the peo..&#xD;
pIe stared at us as if they was bethunderstruck. The miii-&#xD;
ister wa~ a reading' the sam, and be stoppt as much as a&#xD;
minnit; but Missis Hitchins and Zady was surprisder than&#xD;
anybody else. I never extracted so much attention inniy&#xD;
life as I did that day in the New Hartford presbiteerian&#xD;
ineetin' house -~ once' in the sairmon 'the minister illuded to&#xD;
the sorrers and disappointment of airth, and I groaned out&#xD;
loud, and everybody lookt round at me, and' sum ~nfeelin&#xD;

stopping' right short in his dizeourse, says he," My f'riuds,&#xD;

stoppt laffin, and the 'men folks generally stoppt staring' ~&#xD;
'but' the winnmin folks couldent help peekin' round once in&#xD;

men folks in~ the stage; all on 'em uncommon muffins but&#xD;
one, and he was sich an attracktyve man I can't help de-&#xD;
scribin' on him; he had &amp;amp; 'very dignified but summat&#xD;
stairrin' phizziog~rmy - tho' when he addressed himself to&#xD;
rue a brand smile played over his feeders but I never see&#xD;
the beat of hisconversationable powers afore 'nor sen. The&#xD;
otI~er passengers was electrificated by his eloquation, and&#xD;
didn't say but very little, and no wonder! He was talking '&#xD;
about Utica~ when I got ~ and it was evident that he was&#xD;
a resider qf-that citty.~ ~&#xD;
"GentP~men," says he, "our citty is the centre of the&#xD;
State - I may say of the United States. It is as remark-&#xD;
erbJe for its intairnal arrangements as it is for the&#xD;
enlightenment and information of its inhabiters. It is&#xD;
in all respects very fur previous to Phelideiphy. New York&#xD;
itself can't hold a candle to it. Gentlemen! where will&#xD;
ye find such refinement of manners and elegance of ap-&#xD;
peerence as the ladies of our city pozzess? and where sich&#xD;

TheiIturnino~ to me with a ravhin' smile, says he, "Mum,&#xD;
have ye ever been in Utica, mum&#xD;

very distres~in' circumstances."&#xD;
"Ab!" says he, with a very greacef'ul inclination of&#xD;

Jest then we cam to Little Falls, and the four codgers&#xD;
got out and a remarkerbie ginteel woman and a little boy&#xD;
about five year old got in. It was considerable dark and I&#xD;
couldn't see her feeters extinctly, but putty soon she 'spoke&#xD;
to the little boy, and I recognatid her voice in a minnit.&#xD;
"Goody gracious, Miss Van Dusen!" says I.&#xD;
"Maircifal heavens! my dear Permilly!" says she -&#xD;

0! if 'there is a minnit when the heart-broken sperrit&#xD;

"0! Permilly!" at which Mr. Spluttergut, the gentle-&#xD;

recoveratid from. ~ur jouful surprise I axed her ~where she&#xD;

"What's yer name, you little d~arlin'?" says I, kissing'&#xD;

continyd she, "1 wanted to giv him a cognomer that wo'd&#xD;
sound 'well in congress I intend he shall write it 'L.&#xD;

"'Charmin' name," says I. Then she axed me where I&#xD;
was guuyne? And I begun to the heginnin' of my history&#xD;
arter I left her seminary and tell'd her the bull, and she&#xD;
was very much affectid.&#xD;
"0!" says she,."~~~wd that yer sensaty've and mo-&#xD;
rantic nater would have to suffer wonderfully from the cold&#xD;

ci~perate Jabezes affection, sayin' that a heart like hisen&#xD;
was woth possession , and more'n all that 'twas time I. was&#xD;
~settled down.&#xD;
Well, bime-by we arrive to Durrup, (or Skenackedy,&#xD;
as 'sum calls it,) and Missis Stokes invited me to 'accompa-.&#xD;
nate her to her father-in-law's and becin' eeny most tired&#xD;
out, for we'de rid all night, I thought I would. So we&#xD;
got out and I ax~ed Mr. Spluttergut to call on me if ever&#xD;
he ciim our way, and he wanted to be conformed where F&#xD;
resided; and I tell'd him in the villidge of Podunk. "Ah,&#xD;
egzactly," says he, ~with a graceful inolineation, "I re-&#xD;
member the loquation very well now it's a short distance&#xD;
previous to Schaticoke."&#xD;
"Jest so," says I. So then we sepperati4, and I never&#xD;
see a bow that was a sircumstence to the one he made a&amp;amp;&#xD;
our partin'~&#xD;
Then my former instructoress and me winded our way&#xD;
to Mr. Stokesis, and the old folks was wonderful glad to&#xD;
see Silly, as they called her,. (her name was Prisilly miter-&#xD;
ally,) and I raly tho't they'd eat up little Lord Mortimer,&#xD;
and they was very perlite to me tew, and said that if Ide&#xD;
stay till arter dinner they'd send m~ hum in their wagging,&#xD;

&#xD;
and so I concluded I would, "-tho' ev'ry minnit," jackilatid&#xD;
I,." that restrains me from my adored mother seems like&#xD;
an eternity of a hundred year." Well, we had dinner, and&#xD;
then Philo Stokes - the old folksis youngest son got&#xD;
the wagging reddy, and arter tellin' the Stokesis to cum to&#xD;
Podunk, Missis Silly Stokes perticklearly, and imbracin'&#xD;
her tenderly, I and my chist, and Philo set off for Podunk.&#xD;
We got there about 4 o'clock, and as we was a drivin' into&#xD;
the villidge, I cryin' and ringin' my hands distractiously,&#xD;
we met Mr. ~mith, the ~nfeelin' postmaster, and says&#xD;
he,-&#xD;
"No wonder ye cry; ye've ben the means of yer poor&#xD;
mother&#xD;
"Benthe means on her," says I.&#xD;
"Yis," anserd he, "' Missis Smith says she haint a&#xD;
doubt but what 'twas takin' on about you sot her into the&#xD;
dizorder she died on she was.. berried yesterday."&#xD;
When he said that I sunk faintin' away in the 1~ottom of&#xD;
the wagging jest as Amandy did when' her father died -&#xD;
and I remaindid onsensible till we got to fathet"s. Philo&#xD;
was eny most skeart to death. "What ails yen?" says he.&#xD;
"I've fainted away," retorted I, "ye must git ~umbody&#xD;
to ~help ye lift me out when we-git to father's." So he&#xD;
druv as tight as ever he could and eny most jolted me ~to&#xD;
death, 'and seem' father to work in the feeld he hollered to&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Iluilo! Mr. Ruggles, cum and help git yer porter&#xD;
out of the wagging she says she's faintid away." So&#xD;
father he cum, and he and Philo hawld me out head fust&#xD;
and eny most kilt me doin' on't. Ketury she cum running'&#xD;
out, and with her resistancee I manidged to git into the&#xD;

Arter ide staid onsensible a spell, I.open'd my eyes and&#xD;

Well, I ushered him into the square room and, sot&#xD;

"That's the checker," says he.&#xD;

teild Ketury all about it, eau~e I knowa she wouldent tell&#xD;

then I put on my travellin' habileations and arter imbracin'&#xD;
Ketury ii sot off, for Dorrup. Well, 'twas five mile there,&#xD;
and when I got therethe stage had went nut. So I went&#xD;
over to~ old Mister Stokeses~ and telid 'em Ide found my&#xD;
mother dead and concluded to go right back to Higgins&#xD;

telld me that old Mr. Stokes was a guayne to Utica in the&#xD;
inornin' on bizness in his own waggin, and if I was a mind&#xD;
to I mut go with him. "Well," says I, "I reckon I&#xD;
will."&#xD;
"But," says Missis Stokes, "where's yer chist ?"&#xD;
"0!" says I, "I reckoned I wouldent be bothered with&#xD;
it, and they're a guayne to send it on." Well, I stayd&#xD;
there all night, and in the morning' we sot off for Utica.&#xD;
Old Stokes didn't drive very tight, and so we was three&#xD;
days a guayne to Utica - but as I waiit to 'eend my Rec-&#xD;

We arrive to Utica jest at the edge of the evening' and&#xD;

Beein' thus attired I took my parrysol and sot out to&#xD;
look up Spriggins, and you nevei' in all yer born days see&#xD;
sich a staring' as there was whilst I walkt up Ginnisee&#xD;
Street - everybody cum to the doors and wonders, and&#xD;
evet' so menny men and boys followed artei~, me a hoorawin'&#xD;
and inakin' a terrible fuss - but I was so akustomed to&#xD;
admiration I 'didi~'t mind it a bit, but plummenaded 'along&#xD;
with the biggest onconsairn and dignitude. Well, arter&#xD;
preambleatin' a number of 'streets, finally I cum round to&#xD;
~a place they called the "Reading. Room," and I stopt to&#xD;
the door and looked in. The room was full of' gentlemen,&#xD;
and ~is sure 'as a gun, in the midst on 'em was Mister&#xD;
Spluttergut (the gentleman I met in the stage), and he&#xD;
was a harangewin on 'em with the most oncomparalleled&#xD;
eloquence, and they was all a listening' with 'the biggest&#xD;
attention~&#xD;
Well, whilst I vi~as a listening' to the s1~rprisin' and capti-.&#xD;
vatin' .sentinAents he' pored forth' consairnii~' railroads and&#xD;
canals, I see suthin' yaller 'a sticking' up amonket a mess&#xD;
of beads' in the fur eend of the room, and whilst I was a&#xD;
w6nderin' what 'twas, the heads moved, and lo and be-.&#xD;
'hold! 'twas the tip top of Jabezes hair. As soon as I&#xD;
see him I skrield out, "My Jabez 4 My Jabez!" and&#xD;
rushed into the room - Jabez he' see me and he lookt sur-&#xD;
prised enuff- we squoze thro' the men, and when~ we&#xD;
reach one another I buy myself' fainting' into the arms of&#xD;
my adoring' Spriggins. I never see a surprieder set' of&#xD;
folks than the men in' the Utica Readin' Room was that&#xD;
minnit. 'They all gin way and fixt a seat for me -~- even&#xD;
Mist~r Spluttergut stopt ~his harangew, exelarnigatin',&#xD;
"Quite an ok-kurrence."&#xD;
&#xD;
Well, arter a sp4l one of the young men hild a lit segar&#xD;
to my nose, and that fetcht me tew. So I riz up and takin'&#xD;
hold of Sprigginses arm we perceedid to Baggses hotel.&#xD;
Arter we arrive there Jabez axed me whether ide be mar-&#xD;
ried there or wait till we got to Higgins Patent.&#xD;
"0 here, certingly," says I, "in this ere celebrated ho-.&#xD;
tel in the ginteelest siLty in creation."&#xD;
So Spriggins went arter the justice, and there we was&#xD;
married. As soon as the serrynnony was overdone, husband&#xD;
he caild for~ some pie and cheese, and after weed eat it he&#xD;
brun~ up his hoss, and as soon as ide arranged my tray-.&#xD;
ellin' dress, he surmounted his creetur, and I, resisted by&#xD;
a number of gentlemen, got on behind him, and I sonny&#xD;
II bleevo the hull town of Utica was collected to see us go,&#xD;
and wh~n we whipt up the hoss and sot off, they gin three&#xD;
all-to-pieces cheers, in honor of us. ' Well, we went as&#xD;
fast as the hoss could go with sich an. uncommon heft and'&#xD;
arrove to Higgins Patent about leven 'o'clock at night.&#xD;
Mother and Father Spriggins was abed, but they got up&#xD;

CHAPTER 1.&#xD;
HAT modest-looking white house that stands&#xD;
somewhat isolated, whose is it? lit seems the&#xD;
abode of ease without pretension."&#xD;
It belongs to Mrs. Lee, widow of Dr. Lee;&#xD;
whose sudden death, some fifteen years ago, cas&amp;amp;~a gloom&#xD;
over the whole community. He was in the prime of life.&#xD;
Talent and probity had raised him to an enviable standing&#xD;
in his profession, when by the mysterious ordering of&#xD;
Divine Providence, he was cut off without a molnent*s&#xD;
warning. Yet not, we trust, without preparation, fQr one&#xD;
whose life, like his, is a oon~tant exercise of Christian vir&#xD;
tues, cannot be unprepared for death, however or when-&#xD;
ever it may arrest 1~im.&#xD;
He had just returned from visiting some distant patients,&#xD;
and was caressing his only child, when Mrs. Lee left the&#xD;
room to make preparations for tea. A few moments after,&#xD;
litt.Ie Mary came running out, crying:&#xD;

&#xD;
"Mamma, I can't wake papa, do come and help me&#xD;
wake papa!"&#xD;
Mrs. Lee supposed, however, that he had fallen asleep&#xD;
through weariness, and telling the little girl "not to dis-&#xD;
turb papa," took her by the hand and led her softly back&#xD;
into the apartment. But what a sight was she destined to&#xD;
behold! Her husband had sunk back in his chair- and,&#xD;
one glance at his face revealed the awful certainty -~ he&#xD;
was d~ad! A piercing shriek rang through the house,&#xD;
and then for many hours the wretched woman knew noth-&#xD;
ing of what was passing around her. The horror and&#xD;
agony of the first hour of returning, consciousness, I&#xD;
could not, if I would, depict.&#xD;
It was long, very long, before she recovered from the&#xD;
shock, for. she had loved her husband devotedly. Yet&#xD;
after his death she felt that she had not fully appreciated&#xD;
his 'noble character. She knew not all hi~ excellence until&#xD;
he was gone. None but herself, thotight that Margaret&#xD;
Lee had failed in any duty towards th~ departed. He had&#xD;
never thought so. And yet before her mind arose a&#xD;
fk~usand little errors and delinquencies, which her teiider&#xD;
conscience magnified into great faults 'and failures resulting&#xD;
from. gross selfishness. She did not say, as many would&#xD;
in a like affliction, "He was my idol and therefore Heaven&#xD;
has taken him from me." But she said, in the bitterness of&#xD;
her heart, "I did not love him as I ought. I did not do&#xD;
half that I might have done to make him happy, and thus&#xD;
am I punished."&#xD;
The weight of such a sorrow would have crushed her,&#xD;
had not the care of her little daughter contributed to&#xD;
divert her thoughts from running always in the same dark&#xD;
channel. There had been a wonderful affection between&#xD;
&#xD;
this child and, her father, whom she: strongly resembled&#xD;
both in features and disposition~ She was but three years&#xD;
old when he died, and for some time, she could ~not coinpre-&#xD;
hend that he was to return no more. At every sound of a&#xD;
c~irriage, or step in the hall, she would, run out to meet&#xD;
"'papa." When at length she was made' to understand&#xD;
that he could not come back to her, but that if she 'was a&#xD;
good girl she would one day go to him, she gave up look-&#xD;
ing for her father, and seemed only desirous to ~e very&#xD;
good, that she might go to him. 'Many times in the day&#xD;
she would go ~to her mother, and folding her arms upon&#xD;
her knee would say, "Now mamma tell Mary about papa."&#xD;
And then the heart-broken mother told her of her father,&#xD;
and the blessed place where he was waiting for them both.&#xD;
As she looked at the bright little being who stood with her&#xD;
dimpled hands resting on her mother's lap, and her deep,&#xD;
thoughtful eyes turned up so' earnestly to her face; she&#xD;
trembled that one so pure and skinless should be left to her&#xD;
weak 'and erring guidance.&#xD;
"But God has committed her to me,' said 'she, "and&#xD;
He will: help me." 'And 'earnestly did' she pray 'for His&#xD;
help.&#xD;
Every evening when her mother was undressing her, the&#xD;
little one never failed to ask the question, "Mauxma, has&#xD;
Mary been a good girl to-day?" And on receiving an&#xD;
approving answer, she' would say her prayer and go to&#xD;
sleep very happy..&#xD;
A few months ~after her father's death she was stricken&#xD;
with the scarlet fever. For' two days she suffered in-&#xD;
tensely, and~ appeared' scarcely conscious of anything save'&#xD;
~her own pain. 'On the Third, at evening, this abated, ~an4.&#xD;

&#xD;
the little girl as she lay in her mother's aims, looked up&#xD;
and said faintly:&#xD;
"Mamma; h~is Mary been a good girl to-day?"&#xD;
Mrs. Lee pressed the precious child to her bosom and&#xD;
whispered, "Yes, darling, Mary is always a dear, goQd&#xD;
little girl."&#xD;
An expression of perfect peace passed over tl~e cherub&#xD;
face. She murmured her childish prayer and then fell&#xD;
asleep - a long, quiet sleep it was, from which she awaked&#xD;
in Paradise.&#xD;
Who can understand the utter desolateness of the child-&#xD;
less widow as she sat alone in her solitary dwelling' from&#xD;
which she felt that light and joy were forever departed!&#xD;
And yet there was no other place on earth so dear to her.&#xD;
It was the home whither she had come a bride, but a few&#xD;
years before, ~nd those few~ years had been by far the&#xD;
happiest of her life. The happiest yet clouded by the&#xD;
greatest sorrow she had ev~ known. And here she&#xD;
resolved to . pass the rest of her days. She therefore&#xD;
rejected all' solicitations to return to the east, her former'&#xD;
home, and where her only surviving near relation, a&#xD;
sister, still resided.&#xD;
This sister who was many years older than Mrs. Lee,&#xD;
had married very rich, and her family lived in a style. and&#xD;
rnqved in a circle wholly at variance with Mrs. Lee's taste&#xD;
and circumstances. An annual visit of a few weeks was&#xD;
all that she would proniise1 them. From this visit she&#xD;
always returned eage4y to her own unostentatious home,&#xD;
and the graves of her buried treasures.&#xD;
She no longer, mingled in general society; it had lost&#xD;
all attraction for her. Her visits were mostly visits of&#xD;
mercy. She was not rich, but ,her income was much more&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
than sufficient for her own expenditure; and the overplus&#xD;
she devoted to charity~. She was not like those careful&#xD;
far-seeing persons who are always laying in store for a&#xD;
"rainy day" to come, such 4ays were instantlyy falling&#xD;
in her pathway. They were the suffering and the needy,&#xD;
and she thanked Heaven that one consolation remained to&#xD;
her in the midst of her afflictions the power sometimes&#xD;
to alleviate those of others. She had few intimate friends,&#xD;
for although there was that in her grief which invited sym-&#xD;
pathy, the dignity of her manner checked all familiarity;&#xD;
and those few only knew the real humility and sweetness&#xD;
of her character.&#xD;
Year after year passed away, and Mrs. Lee remained&#xD;
the same. 'Unchanged in her simple habits and retiring&#xD;
manners. Unchanged in her quiet, unobtrusive, way of&#xD;
doing good. Unchanged in her silent sorrow. Un-.&#xD;
changed in her mourning 4ress. She was a wonder to&#xD;
many who knew that ~with her youth, her appearance,&#xD;
and her station, she might, if she chose, be the idol off a&#xD;
flattering crowd, the leader of fashionable society. And*&#xD;
they thouglit it" astonishing that she didn't at least go&#xD;
into second mourning,, which would be so much more be-&#xD;
edming to her style of beauty."&#xD;
And so, with her loneliness and her prayers, her corn.&#xD;
munings with the departed and her labors of love, we .w4l1&#xD;
leave her awhile.&#xD;
In the outskirts of the same town, or what was then&#xD;
0&#xD;
the outskii'ts, stood a poor old house, which has long since.&#xD;
been demolished to make way for new ones. Old and&#xD;
poor it certainly was, but still neat and comfortable. And&#xD;
in it dwelt another widow and her only daughter. Mrs.&#xD;
Grant had been the wife of an industrious and thriving&#xD;

&#xD;
mechanic, who left a prosperous business in a small village&#xD;
not far distant, and came hither in the hope of doing&#xD;
better. But unfortunaP4y he soon fell into intemperate&#xD;
habits wasted his little property died miserably and&#xD;
left his wife and child to struggle with poverty as best&#xD;
they might.&#xD;
Susan, the girl, was too young then to do much, and&#xD;
Mrs. Grant was obliged to work very hard to maintain&#xD;
them both, andipay the rent of beE small tenement. But&#xD;
as Susan grew older she became very useful. When she&#xD;
was thirteen or fourteen years of age, she 'learned the&#xD;
business of dress-making; and in ~ few years was able to&#xD;
earn a comfortable subsistence for herself and her mother.&#xD;
The latter through anxiety and over-exertion, had become&#xD;
prematurely infirm, and was only equal to the discharge&#xD;
of her own household duties. These she performed while&#xD;
Susan went her daily rounds amongst her employers. The&#xD;
evenings they passed happily together.&#xD;
Mrs. Grant was a truly religious woman, and she had&#xD;
trained he2 daughter to piety and an abhorrence of eVery..&#xD;
thing that is evil. The young gh'l was ~often thrown in&#xD;
the wa~r of temptation as she pursued her calling, but, she&#xD;
overcam&amp;amp;it, and grew up good and virtuous, a pattern&#xD;
of neatness and quiet industry. Everybody liked Susan&#xD;
~4rant. And when at length she married, almost every-&#xD;
body 4iought she had done remarkably well to get George&#xD;
Elmer, a young man of excellent principles and great&#xD;
activity. In fact one who was called a very "enterprising&#xD;
young man."&#xD;
There were some, howev~, who pronounced him "vis-&#xD;
ionary." That is, wanting ~n stability and perseverance.&#xD;
For. although he was both active and intelligent, and&#xD;
&#xD;
always engaged in. some sort of business, he ~nevei' fob&#xD;
lowed any one occupation long enough to acquire much&#xD;
pro~fidency, or realize much profit in it.&#xD;
He had been a carpenter, a printer, a merchant's clerk,&#xD;
had studied medicine~a short time, law a still shorter time,&#xD;
and had abandoned the last for dentistry, in which he was&#xD;
engaged at the time of his marriage. Thus he went fx~om.&#xD;
one thing to another, ~iever exactly failing in any, but&#xD;
always relinquishing each for something else which his&#xD;
sanguine nature imagined would prove much moi~e lucra-&#xD;
tive.&#xD;
With this propensity to change, it is not surprising that&#xD;
George Elmer laid up little or nothing. His family was&#xD;
always. comfortable it is true. But that was the result of&#xD;
Susan's good management more than of his. Still he was&#xD;
a very kind husband and father, and there was nowhere a&#xD;
happier family to be found than theirs.&#xD;
Susan's mother lived with them, and was. regarded by&#xD;
the affectionate young couple as a great blessing and come&#xD;
* foi~t. She did indeed make herself useful in many ways,&#xD;
particularly in sharing with Sus t care of the children,&#xD;
- of whom there were two, - ~, t pretty little creatures&#xD;
as ever blessed a fireside.&#xD;
When these were about six and four years old, George,&#xD;
who had long since given up dentistry for something else,&#xD;
and that again for something else, bought out a daguer-&#xD;
nan who was going to California, and began the business&#xD;
on~his own account.&#xD;
For several months he worked vigorously at it, making&#xD;
wretched likenesses, having a world of trouble with his&#xD;
"chemicals," and consequently very' little patronage, as&#xD;

&#xD;
there was a rival professor in the place, whose skill was&#xD;
unquestioned.&#xD;
But at length his efforts were crowned with success. He&#xD;
fairly mastered the ttrt. His "chemicals" worked admir-&#xD;
ably, and he turned out pictures~ that were more life-like&#xD;
than the originals themselves~ His "Daguerrian Gallery"&#xD;
became famous,. and that of his rival dwindled into insigni-&#xD;
ficance. He had plenty to do. His pictures commanded&#xD;
a good price. His circumstances began visibly to im-&#xD;
prove, and he felt warranted m taking a larger and more&#xD;
commodious house for his family.&#xD;
Such was the ~tate of things, when George Elmer sud-&#xD;
denly resolved to follow the example of his illustrious pre-&#xD;
decessor, and go to seek his Portune in California. This&#xD;
was in the early stage of the "gold excitement." The&#xD;
daguerrian had not been heard from. But one other' di-&#xD;
vidual had gone from the same place, a shoemaker, the&#xD;
first who had ventured, and wonderful accounts of his&#xD;
success had travelled back.&#xD;
Susan Elmer heard the announcement of her husband's&#xD;
intention with a heavy heart. She tried to dissuade him&#xD;
from the undertaking. The perils of the journey, the&#xD;
dangers of the climate, the uncertainty of success, and&#xD;
the. unavoidably long separation from his family in, any&#xD;
case, all these she represented to him, but in vain, lie&#xD;
saw no possibility of failure. His mind was made up.&#xD;
"0 George," said she, ." we are doing well enough.&#xD;
You are just beginning to realize something ~frorn yOur&#xD;
present business, with a p4spect of making a handsome&#xD;
support in time."&#xD;
"0 but it takes such an everlasting* while to get rich&#xD;
here. I can make more in California in one year than I&#xD;

could here in my whole life-time. Just think of Smith,&#xD;
the shoemaker! he's making money like dirt. I don't&#xD;
mean to be away over a year, and a year's soon gone you&#xD;
know. And then -~ hurrah, Susy! we'll roll in gold&#xD;
dust!"&#xD;
Little Johnny who stood 'beside his mother, sobbing out&#xD;
of sympathy with her, thought "that wouldn't be nice at&#xD;
all, it wasn't pretty to roll in dust."&#xD;
"We shall see, my son," said his fatherer patting his&#xD;
head, "we shall see.~~&#xD;
Susan was silenced but not convinced. She saw thatE&#xD;
her husbar~d was fully resolved upon going. She there-&#xD;
fore ceased her opposition and went to work diligently to&#xD;
prepare his wardrobe. But despite her efforts to look on&#xD;
the bright side of things, she had many sad forebodings.&#xD;
And so had Mrs. Grant. She thought it a great risk to&#xD;
run for a very small gain.&#xD;
Elmer sold out his daguerrian apparatus for much less&#xD;
than it cost him, settled up his business, and prepared to&#xD;
take his departure. Susan proposed that he should carry&#xD;
with him his case of dentist's instruments. "It won't&#xD;
take a great deal of room," she said, "and you may find&#xD;
it necessary to do something besides dig for gold, before&#xD;
you come back."&#xD;
George laughed and said, "So I suppose you think&#xD;
that the little I do succeed in turning up would be profit-&#xD;
ably left behind in people's teeth."&#xD;
But Susan, when she packed his trunk, put the case of&#xD;
instruments in the bottom, thinking that at least they&#xD;
would do no harm.&#xD;
A sum of money that would have sufficed to support&#xD;
them all in comfort for a year or n~ore under Susan's care-&#xD;

Cal management, was requisite for George Elmer's outfit&#xD;
and travelling expenses, ~onsequently he was unable to&#xD;
leave, them much. The man wEG had taken his da-&#xD;
guerrian apparatus, a Mr. Green, - not long resident in&#xD;
the village - bud not yet paid, but was to band the money&#xD;
to Mrs. Elmer in the course of a week or~ two. This,&#xD;
George said, w6~iid be ample for all their expenses, until&#xD;
he. should send th~ii a supply, which he hoped to do before&#xD;
many months. Ailil in a year or a year and a half at&#xD;
the farthest, "he would be with them again. And then&#xD;
I "&#xD;
they would have a house of their~own suck a house too&#xD;
And so George Elmer bade his wife and children fare-&#xD;
well. With some tears it is true, for be loved them dearly,&#xD;
and it was for their~ sakeq that he left them; yet with high&#xD;
hopes and brilliant anticipations of a golden future. Poor&#xD;
Susan could not speak at all. *The little ones cried aloud,&#xD;
and old Mrs. Grant as she pressed his band in both her&#xD;
own, said with a trembling voice: "God bless you, my&#xD;
son, and bring you safely back again."&#xD;
"Ask it Qf Him every day,' mother," responded the&#xD;
young man, "and a11 of yo~m pray for me daily till we&#xD;
meet again, as I surely shall for you. Keep up good&#xD;
courage 'twill notbe long after all - a year is soon gone."&#xD;
For some little time after George's departure, 'his family&#xD;
contrived to get along without incurring~ debts. But&#xD;
Susan'~ small stock rapidly decreased.~ The winter was at&#xD;
hand. Wood and many other necessaries ought to be pur-&#xD;
chased. But so far from beings able to procure these, she&#xD;
had scarcely enough 'to supply their immediate wants. The&#xD;
man .Green, to her great disappointment, had left the place&#xD;
without 'paying what he owed, and gozme no one knew&#xD;
whither. Very soon after her hd~band went away, she&#xD;

p&#xD;
resumed her old occupation pf dress-making, took the&#xD;
work in, and devoted to it eveijy moment of time that she&#xD;
could spare from her other d&amp;amp;ities, which were rendered&#xD;
heavier by the increasing feebleness of her mother~ The&#xD;
winter came. Another child was added to the little flock,&#xD;
- a nice boy. His mother looked sadly in his unconscious&#xD;
face and wondered "what would become of him."&#xD;
"Trust in the Loi~d," said the grandmother.&#xD;
"It is all I can do just now," Susan replied with a deep&#xD;
sigh. About this time the r&amp;amp;nt fell due. Mrs. Elmer had&#xD;
not th~ means to pay it. She therefore sold some of her&#xD;
furniture to meet this and oth6r expenses, for she was re-&#xD;
solv~d not to go into debt as long as it could possibly be&#xD;
avoided.&#xD;
Soon after this her heart wa~ gladdened by intelligence~&#xD;
from George. He had reached San Francisco in safety,&#xD;
and was about to start for the diggings," and trusted soon&#xD;
to send her some of the results of his labors. It was&#xD;
cheering to know that he was alive and well, and Susan&#xD;
plied her needle with renewed energy every moment that&#xD;
her baby did not require her attention. Mrs. Gratit,&#xD;
though suffering under a slight paralysis, could still get&#xD;
about with a cane, and assist somewhat in the household&#xD;
labors. And Mary, the eldest child, was very good about&#xD;
amusing the little one, who fortunately was not at all*&#xD;
fretful.&#xD;
Still with all her exertions, itwas very little that Susan&#xD;
could earn by sewing. She had not regained her former&#xD;
strength since the ~Arth of her ~child. ~Never before had&#xD;
she sewed so steadily. She felt that it was undermining&#xD;
her health, but she was determined to struggle on and keep&#xD;
out of debt until the promised aid should oom~ froui her&#xD;

husband. And what if she should receive no such aid?&#xD;
What 'if George after all should be unsuccessful and finally&#xD;
return as 'poor as he went away? At any rate, he should&#xD;
have no debts of hers to discharge, even though she should&#xD;
be obliged to part with every superfluity to avoid them.&#xD;
As the winter wore on, expenses increased. The avails&#xD;
of 'Susan's 'labor were quite inadequate to. meet them, and&#xD;
she accordingly sold several more articles of her furniture,&#xD;
thinking that if all should end well, their loss could be&#xD;
easily supplied.&#xD;
The spring was somewhat advanced, when Smith, the&#xD;
shoemaker, returned from California, and brought news of&#xD;
George Elmer. But 0, what 'news!' lie called to see&#xD;
Susan, and thus his story ran. Poor Elmer had died&#xD;
of the prevailing feyer on the very day that Smith left San&#xD;
Francisco. He had become discouraged with digging for&#xD;
gold, gone to San Francisco, and returned to his former&#xD;
occupation of house building, which was~ very profitable&#xD;
there, and in which he would undoubtedly have done well,'&#xD;
had he not been taken down with . the fever which carried&#xD;
him off in a few days'. Smith saw him the day before he&#xD;
came away. George then did not believe that his illness&#xD;
Would terminate fatally, and~ hoped soon to resume his&#xD;
work. He sent many affectionate messages to his family,&#xD;
with a handsome gold brooch for Susan containing, a lock&#xD;
of his hair and a daguerreotype likeness, and recjuested&#xD;
Smith to say to them that he should come home in six~&#xD;
months or thereabouts.&#xD;
"But we all knew," continued the narrator, "th~~t he&#xD;
couldn't get well, he himself was the only one who had&#xD;
any hope. The doctor told me then that he couldn't live&#xD;
through the night. And so it proved. The next morn-&#xD;
ing I heard he was dead."&#xD;

TRIAkS AND OIIANGES.&#xD;

&#xD;
During this recital Susan Elmer sat like one tut~ned to&#xD;
stone. She uttered no cry. She spoke not a word. Nor&#xD;
did she look towarek Mr. Smith, when he took his de~&#xD;
parture. The grandmother cried violently, and so did&#xD;
little Mary who was old enough to understand something&#xD;
of their loss. Johnny cried too. But for a long time&#xD;
Susan remained in that same immovable state, grasping&#xD;
the brooch as though it 'was all the world to her now.&#xD;
I know not how long she would have sat thus, had not&#xD;
the baby awaked from a long sleep in its cradle and begun&#xD;
to cry. No mother's ear was ever deaf to such a sound.&#xD;
Susan took up her little one and attended to its wants, and&#xD;
then. she wept. She remembered that ~t was fatherless~&#xD;
"I'm glad to see you cry, my child,~ said her mother,&#xD;
'.' I fared you never would."&#xD;
"I feared s&amp;amp;too, mother," said Susan, "and I thank&#xD;
God that I can."&#xD;
"Trust in the Lord," pursued the old woman. - "He&#xD;
will not forsake us." Susan did not reply.&#xD;
As soon after this sudden and great affliction as Susan&#xD;
could command her thoughts sufficiently for the task, she&#xD;
tried to fix upon some plan by which her expenses might&#xD;
be lessened, and her income increased. As ~a first step,&#xD;
she disposed of all og her remaining furniture excepting&#xD;
only the bare necessaries, and a small mantel clock, which&#xD;
had been George's gift to ~her on the last anniversary of&#xD;
their marriage. She then oved to a small house, or&#xD;
rather two rooms of a house not far distant, at a much&#xD;
lower' rent, and though almost broken down with fatigue&#xD;
and sorrow, applied herself more constantly than ever to&#xD;
her needle. The poor have no time for idle grief.&#xD;

CHAPTER Ii.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE report of George Elmer's death soon reached&#xD;
Mrs. Lee. This lady, of whom the reader&#xD;
'already knows something, had not heard of the&#xD;
family before. At least not particularly, for 'she&#xD;
resided at the 'opposite extremity of the place. She had&#xD;
visited Elmer's daguerrian 'rooms, and remembered the&#xD;
proprietor as an intelligent, well-mannered young man.&#xD;
Had the poverty of the Elmers been generally known,&#xD;
she would long since~ have made acquaintance with them.&#xD;
But Susan was no complainer, and very few persons 'had&#xD;
any idea of their destitution. In fact none save those who&#xD;
had bought their furniture for less than half its real value.&#xD;
An~ they were not the ones likely to interest themselves in&#xD;
b~ha~f of the poor.&#xD;
But Mrs. Lee heard of George Elmer's death, heard&#xD;
how 'suddenly and unexpectedly the blow had fallen upon&#xD;
,his poor wife. The name "widow" had always the&#xD;
power to elicit her deepest sympathy, and Mrs. Elmer's&#xD;
'a1iliodon~ affected her unusually. It was like the one great&#xD;
sorrow. of-her own life. So unlooked~.for and overwhelm-&#xD;
ing. Her heart went out towards the bereaved woman,&#xD;
an'd she resolved to go and see her.&#xD;
'~Ac~ordingly, after a' few days, she inquired the way and&#xD;
went. It was' after the family had removed. She knocked&#xD;
at the door of the huzhble dwelling, and was admitted by&#xD;
&#xD;
)&#xD;
&#xD;
Johnny, who showed her into the room where his mother&#xD;
and the rest were collected. Susan's sad, worn face was&#xD;
bent low over her sewing. The old motrier was knitting&#xD;
socks at ~ixpence per pair for a neighboring variety store,&#xD;
and little Mary was holding the baby on her lap. When&#xD;
Mrs. Lee announced her name, Susan and her mother rose&#xD;
and i~elcomed her. They knew her by reputation.&#xD;
"Mrs. Elmer," said Mrs. Lee, "IF have heard ~of your&#xD;
affliction, and am come, not to intrude 'upon your grief,&#xD;
but to offer you the sympathy which none can so truly feel&#xD;
as those who have experienced a like sorrow."&#xD;
Susan thanked her kind visitor, while tears flowed freely&#xD;
down her pale face. T'need not repeat all the conversatk~n&#xD;
which'ensued. ~iisan was not a great talker, but the little&#xD;
she. said impressed Mrs. Lee very favorably. As to the&#xD;
latter, she possessed the happy faculty of saying just&#xD;
enough, and~ just the right things. On this occasion' she&#xD;
completely won Susan's heart; for. she was free alike&#xD;
from that patronizing manner which offends the sensitive,&#xD;
and thal~ haughtiness which repels them. After conversing&#xD;
some time with ~Mrs. Elmer and her mother, Mrs. Lee&#xD;
turned to the children, and taking from her pocket som'e;&#xD;
sugar~plums, gave theni '~to Johnny, telling 'him to divide&#xD;
them with his sister.&#xD;
"But you see," said Johnny,. who was a very loquacious&#xD;
little fellow, "she can't hold the sugar-plums ~nd the baby&#xD;
too, so if you'll please to take Georgey, then I'll give her&#xD;
some."&#xD;
Susan"was somewhat alarmed at the boy's boldness, and&#xD;
was beginning to check him, when Mrs. Lee reassured her&#xD;
by saying, with a smile, to Johnny,&#xD;

"That's just what I want to do, if the baby will let me;&#xD;
I don't like to frighten babies and make them cry."'&#xD;
"0, but our baby don't cry at strangers," said the&#xD;
little boy eagerly, "he isn't afraid ~f anybody, he'll go to&#xD;
you and stay as long as you want him to."&#xD;
"He looks like a good baby,'~ Mrs. Lee replied; "bring&#xD;
him here, my dear, I'm a great friend to babies."&#xD;
As the little girl advanced with the "infant prodigy,"&#xD;
(as she and Johnny considered him,) Mrs. Lee observed&#xD;
her more particularly than she had done before. She ~was&#xD;
a very pretty child, and her deep blue eyes and~light curl-&#xD;
ing hair brought to the mind of the lonely lady the&#xD;
image of her own lost darling. She took the baby on her&#xD;
lap, and putting her arm round his sister; asked what was&#xD;
her name.&#xD;
"Mary," the little girl answered.&#xD;
Mrs. Lee's eyes filled with te~rs. She looked earnestly&#xD;
in the child's face for a moment, kissed her cheek, and then&#xD;
told her to go and get her share of the sugar-plums.&#xD;
The baby ,fully sustained the reputation. which Johnny&#xD;
had giyen him, by laughing an~26Wing at Mrs. Lee, 'and&#xD;
taking great liberties with her bonnet and shawl, to her ev~-&#xD;
ident satisfaction. She had a great fondness for children,&#xD;
although she was not wont to manifest it in the boisterous&#xD;
manner of some. But ~while apparently wholly occupied&#xD;
with the baby, she was not unobservant of the two older&#xD;
children who' retired to a corner for the purpose of dividing&#xD;
her trifling gift. She was much pleased at the manner in&#xD;
which this was done.&#xD;
Mary counted them (Johnny could not count so many)&#xD;
and divided them into two equal optionsns, one of which&#xD;
Johnny poured into her apron.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And here's 'two more because you're the biggest,"&#xD;
said he, taking a couple' from his own share and adding&#xD;
them towers.&#xD;
But Mary objected to thig arrangement. "NoJohnny,&#xD;
you must keep a whole half and two wore because you re&#xD;
the littlest, you know;" and she put ft~~r of them back in&#xD;
her brother's apron.&#xD;
~' No, Mary, that isn't the way,~' Johnny began, and I&#xD;
know not. how much longer they would have argued the&#xD;
point, had not a knock at the door interrupted them.&#xD;
The new arrival was no less a personage than Mrs.&#xD;
Smith, wife of the returned shoemaker of that name. She&#xD;
lived not far from the Elmers' present abode, and having&#xD;
seen Mrs. Lee go there, thought she would take that occa-&#xD;
sion to make a friendly call and find out the object of&#xD;
that lady's visit. iCt wa~ reported that Smith had come&#xD;
back rich. He had indeed a good deal of money and was&#xD;
making quite a noise aboht it. He had followed his busi-&#xD;
ness while absent, and found it much more profitable than&#xD;
digging in the mines. 'But of this he said nothing. He&#xD;
merely said, "he'd been to~~California, and 'therq was no&#xD;
farther necessity for his making shoes; he meant to drive&#xD;
a bigger business." His help-meet, who had long pined&#xD;
for "a large house and a hired girl," was now about to&#xD;
have these wishes realized. She therefore felt "as good&#xD;
as anybody!"&#xD;
But we shall have more to do with her hereafter, there-&#xD;
fore we will dismiss her for the present. Soon after her&#xD;
entrance Mrs. Lee took leave.&#xD;
'As she walked homewards she reflected upon the little&#xD;
incident connected with the sugar-plums, the entire absence&#xD;
of~ selfishnes~ shown by both the children in the division of&#xD;

&#xD;
what was to them quite a treasure. She conjectured, and&#xD;
with reason too, that such a disposition had not been&#xD;
formed or cultiyated by any particular course of training&#xD;
pursued by their parents, but r~iust be th~ natural result of&#xD;
perfect unanimity between those parents. This was the se-&#xD;
cret. George and Susan Elmer were not wise or learned&#xD;
persons. They had no theory of family government -&#xD;
system of "suasion" upon which~ they acted. But they&#xD;
* ' had no differences. They agreed in every thing. With&#xD;
this example of mutual confidence and respect before them,&#xD;
how could the children be other than they were, loving and&#xD;
obedient?&#xD;
That evening, when these little ones knelt by their&#xD;
mother's knee to say their prayers, Mary, who repeated&#xD;
hers first, voluntarily added the name of Mrs. Lee to those&#xD;
for whom she daily prayed; and her brother followed her&#xD;
example. Thus ran the simple petition.&#xD;
"0 God! forgive, all my sins, and make me a good&#xD;
child, and bless my dear father, and mother, and grnnd..&#xD;
mother, and ~ brothers, and Mrs. Lee,. and everybody, fort&#xD;
Jesus Christ's sake. Amen 1"&#xD;
After the children had gone to bed, Mrs. Grant said to&#xD;
her daughter,&#xD;
"Susan, is it - right to let the children pray for their&#xD;
* father now?"&#xD;
"I don't know, mother," replied the sorrowful woman.&#xD;
"I have thought a good deal about it myself, but some-&#xD;
how 'I cannot bear to tell them they must no longer ask&#xD;
God to bless their father. It se~ms like breaking the last&#xD;
link between him and us, and something tells me it is bet-.&#xD;
ter to let them do it. It cannot do them any harm, and&#xD;
surely it cannot hurt poor George, can it, inothei?"'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Just so, it cannot, my child, and I don't believe it will&#xD;
be laid to your charge as a sin."&#xD;
Thus answering, the old mother took off her spectacles&#xD;
and wiped the tears from her eyes, and the two worked on&#xD;
for some time in silence. At length Mrs. Grant said,&#xD;
"Susan, what a difference there is between folks!"&#xD;
"A very great difference, mother. Were you thinking&#xD;
of Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Smith? I was at that moment.",&#xD;
Yes, they were the persons I had in my mind when I&#xD;
spoke.' I noticed the contrast more, I suppose, because&#xD;
they happened to b~ here at tl~e same tune. What a per-&#xD;
fect lady Mrs. Lee is~! how kind and pleasing in her&#xD;
manners!"&#xD;
"She is indeed. It seems to me I never before realized&#xD;
how much there is in kind words. I have felt better ever&#xD;
since"&#xD;
"Yes, they were what the Bible calls 'words fitly&#xD;
spoken.' But that Mrs. Smith! Somehow I can't help&#xD;
thinking she only came~ to spy out the nakedness of the&#xD;
land! can you?"&#xD;
"It did appear so certainly, but you know it isn't right&#xD;
to judge from appearances. She may mean very well,&#xD;
though she isn't at all like Mrs. Lee.."&#xD;
"Very true; she, may mean well, and have an odd way&#xD;
with her."&#xD;
It ,wa~ evident to Mrs. Lee that the Elmers were very&#xD;
poor. K The apartment in which she had found them,&#xD;
although it had an air of comfort which cleanliness and or-&#xD;
der always give to even the meanest abode, yet betokened&#xD;
extreme indigence, and sh~ thought it strange~ that George&#xD;
Elmer should have left his family. so destitute. She in-&#xD;

quired farther concerning them, of Harriet, her maid, who&#xD;
was one of the knowing kind.&#xD;
Harriet was able to give her the required information,&#xD;
for she had found out 'a good deal about them from the&#xD;
1~'Ludlows, who had 'boughtno small part of. Mrs. Elmer's&#xD;
furniture.&#xD;
"0 yes, I meant to tell you ttbout 'em," said she, "for&#xD;
~' I thought likely you'd do ~6mething to help 'em. They're&#xD;
dreadful poor I guess, thou h he left 'em quite cornforta-&#xD;
ble when he went away. But she's been sick a good deal&#xD;
since, and they seem to have run out pretty much. She&#xD;
takes in sewing, and the old woman knitting; 'but I guess&#xD;
it's precious little they earn, for since ~he heard of his&#xD;
death, she's left the good house they lived in, and sold off&#xD;
the chief of her furniture very low indeed. Mrs. Ludlow&#xD;
bQught a nice set of chairs, and a handsome bureau, be..&#xD;
sides several other things of her. She said she though it&#xD;
..was a deed of charity to take 'em; but *for my part, I&#xD;
thought Mrs. Ludlow got a bargain."&#xD;
Mrs. Lee no longer hesitated. She procured a quantity&#xD;
of knitting yiirn, and the next morning set qut with it for&#xD;
the house of Mrs. Elmer. Aftersome little conversation&#xD;
with the woijien, she said, laying the package on the table,&#xD;
"I have brought yarn for Mrs. Grant to knit into&#xD;
stockings for me. She can do 'them at her leisure, as I&#xD;
shall not need them until next fall."&#xD;
* Mrs Grant thanked her, and Mrs. Lee turned the con~&#xD;
versation to, other subjects. She tpiked with Susan about&#xD;
the children, especially Mary, in whom she already felt ai~&#xD;
* unusual 'interest.&#xD;
"Your little girl is like my own, and you must spare&#xD;
her to me for a day now and then."&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
Susan acquiesced cheerfully in this proposal, and it was&#xD;
settled that Mary should go to Mrs~ Lee's one day during&#xD;
the following week. Harriet was to come after her.&#xD;
"0~ I shall be ~o glad!" exclaimed the light-hea~aed&#xD;
child; "but then who'll help mother take care of the'&#xD;
baby?"&#xD;
"I can do that," said Johnny, straightening up with an&#xD;
air of importance. This difficulty disposed of, another&#xD;
suggested itself to Mary'a mind.&#xD;
"Mother," she whispered, looking down at her patched&#xD;
and faded clothes, "What shall I do? my frock is real&#xD;
rusty." -&#xD;
"You have another, my dear;" and Susan colored&#xD;
slightly.&#xD;
"1 know it, but that's just as rusty as this you know."&#xD;
"Never' mind the frock," said Mrs. Lee., smiling. "It&#xD;
is Mary and not the frock that I care about."&#xD;
'Then calling Johnny to her, she gave him a gay wooden&#xD;
soldier, and rose to go. At the same time she dr&amp;amp; from&#xD;
her pocket a five dollar bank note, and proffering it to&#xD;
Mrs. Grant, said,&#xD;
"I will pay you now for the knitting."   -&#xD;
"1 thank you, but I can't change that," said th6 old&#xD;
woman; "and besides I don't know how much to charge&#xD;
until I see how many stockings the yarn 'will knit."&#xD;
" Keep it all if you please," returned Mrs. Lee;' "there&#xD;
is none too much ~ the yarn will knit several pairs, and&#xD;
knitting is slow work; we should always consider the&#xD;
time."&#xD;
Mrs. Grant saw at once, and appreciated with heart-'&#xD;
felt gratitude the ~good lady's delicate manner of bestowing,&#xD;
a charity. '~She thanked her again, and not without tears&#xD;

in her eyes. Mrs. Elmer joined her- mother in expressions&#xD;
of' gratitude, and Mrs. Lee, after. a few more words with&#xD;
the children, and a kiss to the baby, took her departure.&#xD;
"What a woman!" exclaimed Mrs. Grant; ." she&#xD;
didn't even a~k me what I charged. There's not many&#xD;
who do~so, Susan."&#xD;
"Not many/indeed. She 18 ~ne of a thousand."&#xD;
"I feel as if the Lord had raised us up. a friend who&#xD;
knows how tQpity us, for she is a widow herself."&#xD;
"Yes, she is a widow, and that's enough to bear with-&#xD;
out being poor like us, mother."&#xD;
The old woman thought there was something like a&#xD;
murmur in these words, and it grieved her.&#xD;
- "Look there, Susan!" she said, pointing to the' chil...&#xD;
dr'en1 "the Lord leaves yrou all those; yet he. saw fit to&#xD;
take from 'Mrs. Lee the only one she had."&#xD;
Susan turned her tearful eyes towards the little ones,&#xD;
then clasping her hands, said in a low voice, "Thy will be&#xD;
done."&#xD;
It was-indeed a pleasant sight. The baby was in the&#xD;
cradle, crowing over the soldier which Johnny had put&#xD;
iiito his hands, while' the other children sat, one on each&#xD;
side, watching his performances w~ith great s~ti~faction~&#xD;
You like my traii~er don't* you, baby!" said the little&#xD;
boy. "Mrs. Lee's a nice lady; isn't she, baby? I mean&#xD;
to keep my trainer always, wouldn't' you, Mary?"-&#xD;
"YesI' would," answered 'his sister, " but then you'll&#xD;
have to take it away from baby, fo~ he'll soon have the&#xD;
paint all Qff.".&#xD;
"Sure enough, I never thought of that. I'll get him&#xD;
something else." So he raii and 'brought a cord with sev~.&#xD;
*~ral empty spools strung upofi ~t, a plaything which be-&#xD;
&#xD;
came a novelty by the occasional addition. of another spool,&#xD;
and aided by Mary succeeded in extricating the trainer from&#xD;
his perilous situation, and in pacifying the baby, who was&#xD;
at first disposed to gruiiible at the exchange.&#xD;
Notwithstanding Mrs. Lee had said that she should not&#xD;
need the stockings for some months to come, Mrs. Grant&#xD;
determined *to. go to work upon them immediately, as&#xD;
"there was no knowing what might happen." On open-&#xD;
ing the package of yarn, she found ~n. it a note directed&#xD;
to Mrs. Elmer. It contained a few kind words and the&#xD;
sum of twenty dollars. At this additional proof of Mrs.&#xD;
Lee's goodness, Susan's tears flowed afresh, and her&#xD;
mother said,&#xD;
"'He th4 bath pity. on the poor, lendeth unto the Lord V&#xD;
that womati is surely laying up 5easiires in heaven."&#xD;
When little Mary went to pay the promised visit to&#xD;
Mrs. Lee, she wore a neat new calico frock, and she said to&#xD;
the lady, "My mother told me I must thank you for my&#xD;
new frock."&#xD;
The child wa~ very happy that day, looking at books&#xD;
and pictures, and talking with Mrs. Lee ~about thex~i.&#xD;
Then' running out into the pleasant' garden among the&#xD;
many beautiful spring flowers, and expressing her childish&#xD;
wonder and delight to Peter Jackson, the colored man who&#xD;
was working there, asking him a hundred questions which&#xD;
Peter good-naturedly answered. Tlw~n back ag~in into&#xD;
the house, to wonder and exclaim at the variety y of interest-&#xD;
ing objects there. In Mrs. Lee's ow room she saw a&#xD;
child's chair, which delighted her o~reatlf&#xD;
"0 what a pretty chair I" she. exclaimed; "I had just&#xD;

&#xD;
too little to hold many chairs. May Isit down in itMrs.&#xD;
Lee?"&#xD;
This had been little Mary Lee's chair; no child had&#xD;
ever sat in it since *her death. lit was guarded as a sacred&#xD;
relic, and more closely associated with its owner than any&#xD;
other of her little pps~essions so carefully preserved by the&#xD;
bereaved mother.&#xD;
"Yes, you may ~it in it, m~ dear," said Mrs. Lee.&#xD;
"It seems exactly like my own chair," pursued the&#xD;
child as she rocked backwards and forwards in it. "I&#xD;
always used to sit in mine when mother and father were&#xD;
reading. And too, I used to sit in it when I was learning&#xD;
my hymns after 'mother."&#xD;
"Say me some ofyour hymns, d~irling."&#xD;
*     iVNry repeated the simple verses that her ihother had&#xD;
taught her,~ and wondered why Mrs. Lee cried so all the&#xD;
while.&#xD;
"It must be" thought she, "because she feels so sorry&#xD;
that my father is dead." So she thought she would say&#xD;
* something to comfort Mrs. Lee, and pausing in the&#xD;
midst of her hymn, she laid her hand on the lady's arm,&#xD;
and said -&#xD;
"0, don't cry so Mrs. Lee, that's a great deal better*&#xD;
place than this, there's no trouble there, and nobody ever&#xD;
dies, and all good' people shall see each other there again.~~&#xD;
1V1r~. Lee looked wonderingly in the face of' her little&#xD;
comforter. The deep blue eyes, so like those that had&#xD;
once been turned lovingly up to her own as she, talked of&#xD;
heaven and the angels, were fixed upc~i her. It seemed&#xD;
as though the spirit of her sainted child was looking through'&#xD;
them' into her very heart, and tenderly rebuking her long-&#xD;
~ cherished sorrow. A feeling of awe 'stole over' her,~ and&#xD;
&#xD;
pressing her lips to the forehead of the little girl, she arose&#xD;
and led her from the room.&#xD;
Mary went home at evenings happy as child could be.&#xD;
She carried a basket containing several nice books for her~&#xD;
self and Johnny, some pretty stuff to make frocks for the&#xD;
baby, and a bottle of cordial for her grandmother. There&#xD;
was also a mysterious package for her mother, neatly tied&#xD;
up, which Mary was very curious about, but she was too&#xD;
well-bred to ask questions. This was' a suitable mourning&#xD;
shawl for Mrs. Elmer. "Mrs. Lee accompanied the little&#xD;
girl home, and frequently offered to relieve her. But Mary~&#xD;
insisted upon carrying the basket all the way, declaring&#xD;
that it wasn't the least bit heavy. And as she trudged&#xD;
along she chattered incessantly.&#xD;
"0 won't they be glad when I come? How Johnny&#xD;
will jump when he sees his book! and won't the b4aby look&#xD;
pretty in his new frocks! his old ones 'are growing so&#xD;
small, another hasn't got him any in~ ever so long. I&#xD;
wonder~ if the little ro~ue has4~ missed me. It seems a gre at&#xD;
while since I went away this morning, I never was gene&#xD;
so long before."&#xD;
Thus she rattled on; and Mrs. Lee, who had resolved&#xD;
upon asking Mrs. Elmer to let her take little Mary, to&#xD;
be trained and educated as her own daughter, abandoned&#xD;
the idea when she saw how the childioved her home and&#xD;
family. Nay, she almost reproached herself for having en-&#xD;
tertained it. But she had conceived a strong affection for&#xD;
the )ittle creature, and determined to do~all that she ~oiild&#xD;
for her, without having her constantly under her own eye.'&#xD;
As soon as they entered the house, Mary rushed up to&#xD;
the ba~y ~ whom his mother was. undressing, and nearly&#xD;
red him witlikisses. ' -&#xD;

~know what I've got fQr you. And, grandmother, some-&#xD;
* thing for you too. And for you, mother. And I've had&#xD;
such a nice time. .If Johnny had only been there "-.&#xD;
"We will hear about it~by-and-1~y," said her mother,&#xD;
as she rose~ and pressed Mrs. Lee's h~~nd. Mary stopped&#xD;
abruptly, when she remembered who was in the room, and*&#xD;
taking off her bonnet and cape, sat downquietly with the&#xD;
baby in her arms, somewhat impatient it is true, to display&#xD;
the contents of the basket and relate her adventures. In&#xD;
fact, she could not help whispering them over for the&#xD;
baby's benefit, beginning each description thus : -&#xD;
"And what do you think, baby, - I saw - And&#xD;
w~atdo you think; baby! Mrs. Lee said And where&#xD;
do y~u1 think, baby! Harriet went "-&#xD;
From this time the circumstances of the Elmers were&#xD;
much improved. Many comforts were added to their hum-&#xD;

soon begaii to consider the subject of assisting them to hire&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
S soon as Mts. Lee had gone, Harriet prepared for&#xD;
her own departure. She dressed herself hastily,&#xD;
fastened ~he window-shutters, dragged her trunk&#xD;
to the porch, locked the door and ran down to&#xD;
Peter's with the key. After delivering Mrs. Lee's directions&#xD;
to Peter, she went to the stage-house to bespeak her&#xD;
passage. Being told that the stage would call for her in&#xD;
about an hour, she hurried back to parry the note to Mrs.&#xD;
Elmer, who lived in another direction.&#xD;
As. she was passing De~icon Ludlow's, which was nearly&#xD;
opposite .Mrs. Lee's, Miss Eunice called to her from the&#xD;
window. The Ludlows had been watching the proceedings&#xD;
at Mrs.~ Lee's with great interest all the morning. They&#xD;
had seen that lady depart, evidently on a journey, and it&#xD;
was much earlier than she usually' made her annual visit&#xD;
east. But Harriet would 'come in and tell them all about&#xD;
it soon. When,, however, they saw that she too was prepar-&#xD;
ing to 'go away, they felt a slight degree of uneasiness;&#xD;
and seeing her, at length actually about to pass their house&#xD;
without stopping, they feared losing her' altogether and not&#xD;
I&#xD;
finding* out anything, and therefore arrested her progress~ as&#xD;
above stated.&#xD;
"Where are you going, Harriet?" exclaimed .the mother&#xD;
and three daughters, all in a breath.&#xD;
"0 I've got to go up street on an errand, but I'll stop&#xD;
and say goo&amp;amp;by when I conie back."&#xD;
&#xD;
"0 stop now, stop now; can't you?"&#xD;
"Well I suppose I may as well come in a minute now,&#xD;
the stage don't go in nearly an hour yet."&#xD;
And so she went in, to the great relief of the Ludlows.&#xD;
Harriet, although as honest and faithful a girl as ever lived,&#xD;
had a great talent for gossiping, and not being encouraged&#xD;
to exercise it at Mrs. Lee's, was very glad to indulge in an&#xD;
occasional outpouring at Deacon Ludlow's, where it was&#xD;
fully appreciated and, drawn out. In fact their made a.&#xD;
good deal of her there, always invited her to attend the&#xD;
weekly prayer-meeting whenever it was held at their housp,&#xD;
and noticed her in several ways in order to keep her good&#xD;
matured~ Of course the simple-minded girl was flattered&#xD;
by such attentions, and often "ran in," after her work was&#xD;
done up, to chat an hour or so with them, She had no&#xD;
suspicion of the ~stimation in which ~they really held, or&#xD;
professed to hold, her among their acquaintances, to whom&#xD;
they frequently remarked,&#xD;
"What a pert, forward thing that Harriet is! I wouldn't&#xD;
keep such a creature round me, but I guess Mrs. Lee's not&#xD;
very particular who she has, if she only gets her work&#xD;
done.,~&#xD;
Had Harriet known of this, she never would have gone&#xD;
in there again. Not~so much on her own account as Mrs.&#xD;
Lee's, with whom she had lived nearly seven years without&#xD;
a wish to change her place, and whom she regarded as ap~&#xD;
preaching nearer to perfection than any other living person.&#xD;
On this occasion the Ludlow~ had a thousand questions&#xD;
to ask; and Harriet, in her zeal to tell all the whys and the&#xD;
wherefores, the hows and the whens of Mrs. Lee's move-&#xD;
Inents, as well as her own, allowed her minute to be a very&#xD;
long one. After running on for half an hour with great&#xD;

velocity, she jumped up suddenly, declaring she must go,&#xD;
~~for she'd got to take a note to Mrs. thner. But then she&#xD;
was assailed With another volley of questions', on the subject&#xD;
of Mrs. Lee's intercourse with die Elmers, and she could&#xD;
not' resist the temptation to sit down a moment longer and&#xD;
tell about Mrs. Lee's kindness t~ that family, at least as&#xD;
much as she knew about it, for she had often been sent&#xD;
there with vegetables and' other things. "And sometiuThs&#xD;
there was such a load that Peter Jackson had to go, with&#xD;
-it." '&#xD;
"0, shedoes a great deal for them, and there's many a&#xD;
poor family ~an say the same. She's always doing good,&#xD;
I never saw the beat of it; why, some-folks would get rich&#xD;
on what she gives away" -&#xD;
"I wonder if she don't expect to ride to heaven on her&#xD;
~good works," said Mrs. Ludlow.&#xD;
Well, I guess that's, a pretty sure-footed horse ar~y&#xD;
way," responded Harriet with some warmth.&#xD;
"0 Ijarriet, Harriet!" said Mrs. Ludlow solemnly,&#xD;
',' Pm sorry to hear you speak so, it shows what influence&#xD;
you've been under. Dpn't you know the Bible says our&#xD;
own righteousness is but filthy rags? Nothing but a living&#xD;
faith cam save&#xD;
"Yes, I know it, a living fi~ith, and that's just Mr~,&#xD;
Lee's kind Qf faith, for 'faith without works is dead,' the&#xD;
same Bible says, you know."&#xD;
"I'm' glad you read your Bible," said Mrs. Ludlow with&#xD;
a slight sneer, for she felt a little chagrined that the 'girl&#xD;
was able to give her' blow, for blow with her own weapons.&#xD;
Harriet noticed the sneer and answered, -&#xD;
"Well, I won't take credit that isn't my due. I own I&#xD;
don't read my Bible as much as I ought to, though I'+e no&#xD;

excuse, for I've got-a beautiful one that Mrs. Lee gave me.&#xD;
I~ut I hear it read every night find mornii~g, so I know&#xD;
something about what's in it."&#xD;
Perhaps she would have made a few more quotations,&#xD;
liad she not at that moment he~rrd the stage horn.&#xD;
"0 dear me! what shall I do! there's the stage and I&#xD;
~haven't carried the note to Mrs~ Elmer! ~&#xD;
"Never mind," said Miss Eunice, "Sam can run down&#xD;
with it, or one of us can take it to Mrs. Elmer!"&#xD;
Poor Haifriet had no resource but to accept Miss Ludlow's~&#xD;
offer. So she gave her the note saying that it was very&#xD;
important, and she would like her to have it sent as soon&#xD;
as possible. She then hastened out, and s~w the stage&#xD;
still at a little distance off, taking in some passengers. At&#xD;
the 'same moment she observed Sam Ludlow standing by&#xD;
Mrs.' Lee's gate watching the approach of the stage.&#xD;
"I'll give it to Sam myself,~' said she, turning back to&#xD;
the window in time to see the four Ludlows' heads close&#xD;
together over the note, which Miss Eunice was holding up&#xD;
to the light. Just in the midst of their comments upon it,&#xD;
they were startled by the voice of Harriet shouting, -&#xD;
"Give it to me! there's Sam by our~house.".&#xD;
Eunice could do no less than surrender the note, though&#xD;
she would gladly have kept it a little longer to satisfy her-.&#xD;
self in regard to its contents. ' Harriet was somewhat vexed&#xD;
at the curiosity of' the Ludlows, and fe1~ glad to get the&#xD;
nOte back again; she thought it was much better to give it&#xD;
to Sam herself, and 'see him start with it, then she should&#xD;
feel as though it would reach its destination safely. Sam&#xD;
Ludlow was a lubberly boy of, fourteen. He was often&#xD;
hanging abou&amp;amp; Mrs. Lee's gate; and had several times gone&#xD;
on errands for Harriet;. for which she always paid him. a&#xD;

&#xD;
* sixpence in ~tdvance. Sam was very fond of a sixpence,&#xD;
and was much more ready to do errands for Harriet than&#xD;
for his mother. or sisters, as they would nut.pay him.&#xD;
"IIexe, Sam," said she, "I want you to take this note&#xD;
to Mrs. Elmer right away, I'm going in the. stage and&#xD;
haven't time."&#xD;
"Who was your waiter last year?" was Sam's r@ply.&#xD;
Harriet knew that this was the way in which the inter-&#xD;
esting youth usually answered his sisters when they re-&#xD;
quested him to do anything, and she remembered that she&#xD;
bad always paid him for waiting upon her. But she had&#xD;
now no change in her purse,. her money was in bills, she&#xD;
could only promise a reward, she however persevered.&#xD;
"Do take it for me, Sam, tlmt'~ a good fellow, and when&#xD;
I come baAk I'll give you a shillino-"&#xD;
"Give it to me now."&#xD;
"I can't, I haven't got the change, my money is all in&#xD;
bills. Will you take it? see, the stage is close by, I'll&#xD;
surely ~pay you the shilling when Ii come back, and that&#xD;
will be before long I expect."&#xD;
~ Swear you'll do it."&#xD;
No, Sam, I won't swear, that's wicked; but I ~ol-&#xD;
emnly promise."&#xD;
"Well; kiss my jack-knife then, it's all the same in&#xD;
Dutch." And he took out% the weapon 'so dear to every&#xD;
boy's heart, and held it up before her.' They were lifting&#xD;
her trunk to the stage top.&#xD;
~N~Till you carry the note if I'll kiss that?"&#xD;
"As sui~e as gunflints."&#xD;
"And right away, without going home first?"&#xD;
"Right off, as quick as a streak 'o lightning."&#xD;
"Are you coming?" shouted the driver.&#xD;
&#xD;
Harriet kissed the jack-knife,~ gave. Sam the note, and&#xD;
jumped into the stage, calling after Sam to be very care-&#xD;
ful, and not loiter a moment on the way. As she&#xD;
stretched her neck out of the stage window, she had the&#xD;
satisfaction of seeing the young gentleman start on his ex-&#xD;
pedition; not quite so quick as lightning, but at a very&#xD;
brisk pace.&#xD;
His sisters called to him from the window~ but he hur-&#xD;
ried on without noticing them. Not so much that he&#xD;
wished to do his errand faithfully, as because "he didn't.&#xD;
care for them."&#xD;
"She's mighty a xious about this note, seems to me,&#xD;
said Sam, mentally, as he went on his way.&#xD;
"Wonder what 's about! feels as tho~gh~ there was&#xD;
something in it - s wouldn't wonder if 'twas money - pay&#xD;
for sewing I 'spose."&#xD;
The note had been hastily written, and the envelope&#xD;
fastened lightly with a wafer. Sam thought hq'd like to&#xD;
just see what was in~ide~ Harriet was only a hired girl,&#xD;
what did he care for her! Some other vague thoughts&#xD;
floated through his mind. He determined to open it; he&#xD;
could easily stick it together again if he wanted to. So&#xD;
he turned to see whether the stage was out of ~i~ht~ It&#xD;
was no~ longer visible.&#xD;
A few paces on he turned aside into a narrow lane,&#xD;
went behind an old shed, no mortal eye was upon him, he&#xD;
felt quite safe; and, taking out his jack-knife, he slipped&#xD;
the blade under the wafer, which .yielded without difficulty,&#xD;
and Sam found his conjectures correct. Where was&#xD;
money, more money than he had ever seen together be-&#xD;
fore. He blundered through the note as well as he could,&#xD;
and found that the money was a gift, not from Harriet,&#xD;

but from Mrs. Lee. JXe thought of several things that he&#xD;
wanted very much, especially a;fighting~cock, owned by a&#xD;
man who kept a ten-pin alley, and numerous other articles&#xD;
quite as useful and desirable. The temptation was strong.&#xD;
lie saw that the amount was not mentioned in the note.&#xD;
There were several bills; he could take 9ne, it never&#xD;
would be found out. So he stuffed a "five" into his&#xD;
pocket, wet the wafer a little and fastei~ed it ~down again,&#xD;
and then contemplated his work wifh satisfaction.&#xD;
It was well done. Nobody would ever have suspected&#xD;
that the note had been opened. He went on a few steps,&#xD;
and then paused to contemplate it again; and as he did so&#xD;
he reflected, "Why not take the whole while i t~ was in his&#xD;
power? But Harriet ,and Mrs. Lee would Aome back,&#xD;
and then he would be found out. What then?" "Never&#xD;
mind," said the tempter in his ear. "The old nian'll&#xD;
have to fork over, that's all, and you'll have the good of&#xD;
the money."&#xD;
"And the old woman," thought Sam, "how she'll jaw&#xD;
and jaw, jf I'm ever found out."&#xD;
"Never mind that neither," pursued the tempter,&#xD;
"they can't blame you, they expect you to cut up now,&#xD;
you aint converted yet."&#xD;
"So here goes,~~ said Sam, and he tore open the enve-&#xD;
lope, took out the rest of th&amp;amp;money, chewed the note until&#xD;
it became a soft wad, then threw it at the~old shed, where&#xD;
for aught I know to the contrary, it is sticking to this day.&#xD;
He then took his way to the residence of the game-cock's&#xD;
owner, where he astonished divers youug geutlerncm by his&#xD;
display of the ready, although he was careful not to ex-&#xD;
hibit. the whole amount in his possession. It was a strange&#xD;
thino' to see Sam Ludlow with more than a shilling~ in his&#xD;
&#xD;
hands, and of course the "five" which, he drew from his&#xD;
pocket created some surprise.&#xD;
"Why, Sam, where did you get so much?" "Found&#xD;
the way to the old man's locker?" "Old boy loosened&#xD;
his purse string~ at last, eh?" were some of the questions&#xD;
showered upon the young thief. But he contrived to&#xD;
evade them. "Pity if he couldn't h~ve a little money as&#xD;
well as other folks. He didn't see what there was tcr&#xD;
make such a thundering fuss about."&#xD;
When Sam left the ten-pin alhjy, his five was nearly&#xD;
exhausted. He had entered to his het~rt's content into&#xD;
the amusements of the establishment. A thing which he&#xD;
had not been able to do before for want of funds. He&#xD;
had also regaled himself with various good things; and as&#xD;
he walked homewards with his long-desired game-cock&#xD;
under his arm, he felt a high degree of satisfaction; for,&#xD;
notwithstanding he had lost all that he staked \in the&#xD;
games, he still had a large sum left, upon which he meant&#xD;
to revel for a long time to come. /&#xD;
On his arrival at home, his sisters questioned him con-&#xD;
cerning the note. But he gave them no satisfaction.&#xD;
"Didn't you notice what was in it when she opened&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"No; I didn't go in the house at all."&#xD;
"Well, I should like to know whether there was money&#xD;
in that note. Why didn't you wait a minute and see, you&#xD;
stupid fellow!"&#xD;
"What do you s'pose I cared about knowing what w~is&#xD;
q~ the plague note? What business was it of mine?"&#xD;
The game-cock did not attract much attention at the&#xD;
deacon's San~i was alway~ bringing home something of&#xD;
the animal kind to annoy the family, and generally bar..&#xD;
gained it away for something else in a few days.&#xD;

&#xD;
Deacon Ludlow, although himself a worthy, religious&#xD;
man, unfortunately took very little pains with the early&#xD;
training of his children. He never questioned Sam in re-&#xD;
gard to where he spent his evenings. In f4ct, he seldom&#xD;
reproved him for anything. Mrs. Ludlow, it is true,&#xD;
scolded and fretted at-the boy frequently, but he regarded&#xD;
her words no more than the idle wind. Sam Ludlow had&#xD;
started in the road to destruction, and there was no voice&#xD;
to call him' back.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
HE Elmers wondered what had become of Mrs.&#xD;
Lee. Many days passed without one of her wel-&#xD;
come visits. The chafty, 2~ood-natured Harriet,&#xD;
t6o, they missed her almost daily calls. And it&#xD;
was but natural that\they should miss the comforts she&#xD;
was wont to bring. ~After some time it was settled that&#xD;
they must have gone away. At length they questioned&#xD;
Peter Jackson as he was passing one day, and from him&#xD;
they learned the facts.&#xD;
About a fortnight after Mrs. Lee's departure, Mrs.&#xD;
Elmer's mother was suddenly reduced to a state of entire&#xD;
helplessness by another paralytic~ stroke~ She was con-&#xD;
fined wholly to her bed. Her mind also was greatly af-&#xD;
fected, and she shQwed an irritability and fretfulness quite&#xD;
foreign to her nature. Susan's 'labors were'increas~d ten~.&#xD;
fold by this calamity. Her mother required more~ care&#xD;
&#xD;
than an infant, and could not bear to have Susan out of&#xD;
her sight for a moment. Her speech was much impaired,&#xD;
but her sight and hearing were, if anything, quickened.&#xD;
She would have the window~curtains down, for the broad&#xD;
daylight hurt her eyes. The children's noise disturbed&#xD;
her very much, and Susan was obliged to send the two&#xD;
older ones out 'of doors to play, many 'times when she&#xD;
would gladly have kept them in. Her~sewing too, had to&#xD;
be almost wholly abandoned. She had but little time for&#xD;
it during the day, and then 'the room was so dark that she&#xD;
could scarcely see at all. When the evening came, and&#xD;
the little ones were all gone to their rest, the old mother,&#xD;
too, at last asleep, and Susan sat down with her work in&#xD;
hand, she was usually so worn and weary that her fingers&#xD;
almost refused to move.&#xD;
Things went on in this way for a month, and Susan's&#xD;
resources were nearly gone. She 'had for some time past&#xD;
reduced her own and her children'~ food to the smallest&#xD;
possible quantity, and that of the coarsest kind. A little&#xD;
of a better quality she still managed to procure for hei&#xD;
mother, and tIle old woman complained that this was not&#xD;
as good as she wished. Susan knew that her poor mother&#xD;
was not herself &amp;amp;~ny longer, and she never manifested the&#xD;
least impatience with her murmuring. But sh9 missed her&#xD;
encouraging 'words, the "trust in the 'Lord, my child.&#xD;
lie will not forsake you," with which she used to cheer&#xD;
her in times of despondency. And she thought if her&#xD;
mother w&amp;amp;uld only speak so now, she could bear up better~&#xD;
under her trials.&#xD;
'And George, too, how she missed him now! more than&#xD;
ever -~ more eVery day. She could not help itt. 'The&#xD;
future looked very dark. Pay-day was ~drawing on, and&#xD;

&#xD;
where w~is her rent to come from! Pay-day came, and&#xD;
Susan was not ready. The landlord, a hard-fisted, grasp-&#xD;
ing man,, called for his dues. Mrs. Elmer told him it&#xD;
was utterly impossible for her to pay then, she had not a&#xD;
dollar, but if he would give her a few days' time, she hoped&#xD;
to be' able to satisfy him. He appeared to doubt her&#xD;
word, and pointing ,~ to the mantel-clock (Geor~ge's last&#xD;
'gift before he went from home), he intimidated a wish to&#xD;
take possession of ~it.&#xD;
"I'll take that," he' said, "seeincr you don't seem to&#xD;
have anything else that's worth much; though 'it's a poor&#xD;
concern, 'still, I don't know jut I'll take it and let you ~4f,&#xD;
considering."&#xD;
Susan looked at him with astonishment. She was not&#xD;
accustomed to such meanness. She knew that the clock&#xD;
had cost more than double the amount of her debt, a~id&#xD;
she knew that the nian must be aware of its value. ~$4~ e&#xD;
hesitated a while. It went to her 'heart to part with it.&#xD;
"Well, what do you say? shall I take it?"&#xD;
"' It is a valuable clock, sir, it cost more than twice as&#xD;
much as I owe you, and has not been in use a year yet."&#xD;
The tnan advanced close to her, and impertinently ex-&#xD;
amined her brooch, which she always wore.&#xD;
"That'll do,", said he, after satisfying himself that it&#xD;
was real gold.' '~ P11 take that if you aint' a mind to let&#xD;
the clock go. I'll take it and say square; guess it's worth&#xD;
five dollars. You' owe me twelve; but considering your&#xD;
circumstances, I'll ~be satisfied with that."&#xD;
Long before the conclusion' of this speech, Susan had&#xD;
covered h~r brooch with her hand, as if his very look were&#xD;
profanation; and when he finished, she turned towards the&#xD;
clock, and said hurriedly,&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
"Take that."&#xD;
He proceeded to take 'jt down, and after it was safely in&#xD;
his possession, he told Mrs. Elmer that she must vacate&#xD;
the house before night, as he bad rented it to some one&#xD;
who would be ready pay. - Susan's indignation .was roused&#xD;
at this shameful injustice, and she said, -&#xD;
"Surely, you do not mean to turn i~e out of the house&#xD;
now, with my helpless mother and little' ones. That&#xD;
clock, too, is fully worth another quarter's rent, and 4&#xD;
good deal more. You will allow me to remain a few\&#xD;
weeks, and meantime I will be looking for another house."&#xD;
"This clock worth another quarter's rent, hey!" and&#xD;
he laughed heartily at the idea. "Why, woman, you&#xD;
know nothing about the value of, things, if you did you'd&#xD;
think I've let you: off pretty easy. As for the house,&#xD;
didn't I tell you I'd let it already to a family that's to take&#xD;
possession to-morrow. I've done the best I can by you.&#xD;
'Everybody must look to their own interest, y~u know, and&#xD;
if I have a chance to let a tenement to better advantage&#xD;
than I can to you, why of course it's my duty to do it., I&#xD;
owe it to my own family ;. scripture, you know, says&#xD;
everybody must provide for their own.&#xD;
Susan said no more, she was not accustomed to disput-&#xD;
ing, and she, allowed 'the face-grinder to depart' without&#xD;
farther parley. When he reached the door, he turned&#xD;
back and remarked that "he should expect to find the&#xD;
4 remises cleared early in the morning of the' follQwing&#xD;
ay." She merely bowed in reply, and he went away, to&#xD;
her great relief'.&#xD;
But where should she go? No, home and no means of&#xD;
procuring one. ' It was still earlj in the day,' not more&#xD;
than ten o'clock. The old woman appeared confused and'&#xD;

tpuzzled at the scene which had'~just taken place, and asked&#xD;
some questions, although she did' not comprehend anything&#xD;
of it. 'Susan, brought her a cup of tea and' a 'bit of toast,&#xD;
sa~ by her, and answered her questions in a manner that&#xD;
sa~jsfied. her, and before long she fell into a sound sleep.&#xD;
Susan' immediately gave the baby into Mary's charge, told&#xD;
Johnny 1'to sit quietly beside his grandmother's bed until&#xD;
her return, put on her bonnet and shawl, and slipped&#xD;
quietly into the street.&#xD;
Where should she go? where, where? If Mrs. Lee&#xD;
were only at home! The thought of writing to her for&#xD;
aid to enable her to remain in her. present abode, crossed&#xD;
her mind. But it was too late. ~She mu4 quit to-day.&#xD;
She looked up the street and then down, undecided which&#xD;
way to go.&#xD;
At length her eye fell upon an old, brown, barnish look-&#xD;
ing 'house, standing alone on a slight eminence,' a little out&#xD;
of the town. She knew it was the residence of Mrs. Mad-&#xD;
dock, the ~voman with whom she learned the business of&#xD;
dressmaking. INow a widow like herself, and poor, too,&#xD;
but nQt in want, for she owned the house which she occu-&#xD;
pied, and by her own labors, she still pursued her former&#xD;
occu potion,~ supported herself and two children, something&#xD;
older than Susan's two eldest. She had also' four children&#xD;
still older, who were all earning their own living at differ~&#xD;
~ent trades. Two sons had gone from home, and two&#xD;
daughters, tailoresses, boarded with their. mother and took&#xD;
in wox~k from the shops.&#xD;
Thither Susan determined to bend her. step~. She had&#xD;
not Been much of Mrs. Maddock since her marriage, but&#xD;
she remembered her as a very kind-hearted woman.&#xD;
'"Perhaps she can help me," thought the desolate&#xD;
&#xD;
woman as she pursued her way. "I, recollect how kind&#xD;
she used to be to us apprentice girls. How in pleasant&#xD;
weather she always sent us~ out on the grass plot twice a&#xD;
day to have a romp, and stretch our limbs. She said&#xD;
our health required it. And what pleasant cooling drinks&#xD;
she used to make for us in hot days."&#xD;
Many other little circumstances Susan recalled as she&#xD;
went along, all of them in Mrs. M.'s favor, and she could&#xD;
not help feeling that she would do something for her now.&#xD;
Nor was she mistaken Mrs. Maddock bad heard of&#xD;
George Elmer's death, but not ,o~/ the circumstances of his&#xD;
family. .She listened to Susan's sad story with tears, and&#xD;
when it was endod, freely offered her a shelter in her own&#xD;
house.&#xD;
"There is one good-sued room at liberty, on the ground&#xD;
floor too, and if you can get along with that, come. We're&#xD;
poor but we have health, and no helpless ones amongst us."&#xD;
"But perhaps I never shall be able to pay you."&#xD;
"'Don't borrow any trouble about that, dear. If you&#xD;
ever should be able to pay ~ne, as I hope you will for your&#xD;
own sake, why well and good. And if you shouldn't&#xD;
'twont kill me. I shan't be any poorer for it a hundred&#xD;
years hence."&#xD;
" No, indeed -you will not," said Susan as grateful tears&#xD;
fell from her eyes. "'He that giveth to the poor lendeth&#xD;
unto the Lord; ' and He will surely reward you whether I&#xD;
ever can or not."&#xD;
She then arose, saying that she x~ould go and\ hire a cart&#xD;
to remove 'her furniture.&#xD;
" Wait a moment," said Mrs. M.., "and I will run&#xD;
over and see ifNeighbor Grey's' team is at liberty to-day,&#xD;
if it should be it will save you the expense of a cart, for&#xD;
they have offered me the use of it whenever I wish."-&#xD;

So she hastened to Neighbor Grey's, and soon returned&#xD;
~ith the pleasing intelligence, that she could have the,&#xD;
team all the~ ~afternoon, and David Grey to drive. It was&#xD;
arranged that immediately after dinner, she would come&#xD;
down with David and the team. She would have a bed&#xD;
laid in the wagon, and Mr&amp;amp; Grant should be removed be-.&#xD;
fore anything else, lest she might be worried by ~he noise&#xD;
and. confusion.&#xD;
When Susan returned home, she found things just as&#xD;
she had left them, anA her mother still sleeping. She&#xD;
prepared their scanty dinner, and soon after they had&#xD;
eaten it, the 6old woman awaked. While Susan was&#xD;
giving her a rather more substantially meal than the rest of&#xD;
£hem bad enjoyed, she told her of the approaching change&#xD;
in their circumstances, and at length succeeded in making&#xD;
her understand that they were going to a new home, much&#xD;
more comfortable than the present one, where they would&#xD;
have no stairs to ascend, and where a very nice woman&#xD;
was living.&#xD;
She appeared rather pleased with the idea of a change,&#xD;
and when the kind-looking Mrs. 1\ktaddock, and the good-&#xD;
natured David Grey boon after came in, she' was quite&#xD;
willing to have them sand Susan lift her gently from the&#xD;
bed and carry her out to the wagon. They laid her .ip an&#xD;
easy position on the soft bed and pillows which Mrs. Mad-&#xD;
dock had arranged, and Susan seated herself beside her on&#xD;
the bed, holding a parasol to shade her face. Mrs. Mad-&#xD;
dock went on the sidewalk carrying the baby, while Mary&#xD;
and Johnny trotted behind her as merry as birds, shouting&#xD;
and talking to the baby, who crowed and laughed back to&#xD;
thorn. They reached the house before 'the rest of: the&#xD;
party, who advanced very ~Iowly and carefully. Susan&#xD;
&#xD;
talked cheerfully to her mother, and the old woman seemed&#xD;
to enjoy the ride very much.&#xD;
When they arrived at Mrs. Maddock's, Mrs. Grant was&#xD;
laid upon Mrs. M.'s bed ur~til her own could be prepared.&#xD;
She appeared rather uneasy at being in a strange house,&#xD;
and would not suffer Susan to leave her~at alL. Therefore&#xD;
Mrs. Maddock kindly offered to go back with the wagon&#xD;
and superintend the loading up of the furniture. There&#xD;
was not much, and it was soon transported. The small&#xD;
piece of carpet was laid down, the bed was set u~, and the&#xD;
old woman was deposited on it, to change no more until&#xD;
she should lie down in the last resting-placeK of us all.&#xD;
As Susan went rbout, arranging her few articles in the&#xD;
quiet room, she felt a degree of satisfaction that she had&#xD;
not known for months. For she was sure that, happen&#xD;
what might, there was now no danger of her poor mother&#xD;
and little ones being turned into the street. She was&#xD;
more cheerful than she,~ad been in a long, long time.&#xD;
There was a certain hymn which she used to be fond of&#xD;
singing, and George of hearing, and this evening as she&#xD;
rocked her baby to* sleep, ~he sang it for the first time&#xD;
since she had heard of her husband's death. It had a&#xD;
chorus which ran thus :-&#xD;
I&#xD;
"Look up, ~uy soull be like the lurk&#xD;
That singing soars afar -&#xD;
There7s ne'er a cloud however dark&#xD;
~Ut veils a shining star."&#xD;
When she had laid her baby down and ceased singing,&#xD;
her mother, who had been lying very quietly for sometime,~&#xD;
said, "Sinr it again, child."&#xD;

&#xD;
Surprised and pleased pusan complied, and when she&#xD;
had finished, the old woinaii said,&#xD;
"Once ~nore, my child~ it sounds so good."&#xD;
So 8he sang it a third tjme, with a tremulous voice and&#xD;
shedding thankful tears all the while. And when it was&#xD;
ended, the old mother took up the last words, "shining&#xD;
star," and~ murmured them over several times, each time&#xD;
fainter, until they died away entirely, and she fell~ asleep.&#xD;
The children, who were in their little bed, had been&#xD;
lying awake, listening to theh~ mother, and presently she&#xD;
heard Mary say in a low voice,&#xD;
"Johnny, are you awake?"&#xD;
Yes, are you?&#xD;
"Yes, did y~u hear mother sing ? "&#xD;
"I guess IL did, didn't it sound pleasant, Mary?"&#xD;
the auo'e&#xD;
"0, it did, it made me think~ ~ ls with shin-&#xD;
ing wings that live above the clouds."&#xD;
"So it did me, how funny that we should think of the&#xD;
same thing!"&#xD;
"So it was, Johnny, it made me think of father too, did&#xD;
it you?"&#xD;
." Yes, I thought -about father while I was thinking of&#xD;
the angels."'&#xD;
"So did I. He used to like to hehr mother sing .that,&#xD;
you know. -&#xD;
"Did he? 1 forget."           -*&#xD;
"Why yes, johnny, don't you remember how he used&#xD;
to ~ay; ' Oome, Susey, sing the "shining star"?"&#xD;
"0 yes, I do remember about it now."&#xD;
"I wonder if he heard her sing 'it now!" said the little&#xD;
girl musingly. And then they went to sleep with their&#xD;
arms round each other's necks.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Susan sat by her little taper, she thought over these&#xD;
childish words. She thought too of her mother's pleasure&#xD;
while she was singing, and of heir peaceful falling asleep&#xD;
afterwards. Then she wondered that she had so long lost&#xD;
sio'ht of the "shining star," and w~s glad sh~ had found'&#xD;
it again. It had made them all so happy. And she knelt&#xD;
down and prayed that her afflictions might.soften her heart,&#xD;
and draw her ~nearer to God. That she might no longer&#xD;
look at the cloud, but through it, and ever keep her eye&#xD;
upon the "shining star" beyond. From this tjme she&#xD;
went about her daily round of toilsome duties, resigned,&#xD;
and even cheerful, and every night she sang the "Shining&#xD;
Star."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
&#xD;
IRS. ELMER was much more comfortable at Mrs.&#xD;
Maddock's than she had been before since Mrs.&#xD;
j Lee went away. Her quarters were narrow, it is&#xD;
true, but there was a shady, pleasant door-yard,&#xD;
where Mrs. Maddock permitted the children to play when-&#xD;
ever they chose. ~There they passed several hours when the&#xD;
weather was fine.. And sometimes they hail the baby with&#xD;
them in a little wagon ~belonging to Jane and Sarah,&#xD;
Mrs. Maddock's little - girls. Meanwhile their mother was&#xD;
busy -within, now at the old woman's bedside, now at her&#xD;
household work, and now. patching and mending for herself&#xD;
and children.&#xD;

MARY ELMER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
Her evenings Susan devoted to sewing for Mrs. Mad-&#xD;
dock. By this means she hoped to p~y her rent, and she&#xD;
was therefore, surprised when after finishing the first piece,&#xD;
that good woman proffered her full pay..&#xD;
"0 no, Mrs. Maddock," said Susan, "I wish to pay&#xD;
the 'r~nt of my room in this way."&#xD;
"Fie! fie! dear," returned 'Mrs. M., throwing the&#xD;
money into her lap, "don't speak 'ohi~at again, if you do&#xD;
I shall be offended. Don't you know you must have&#xD;
something coming in t&amp;amp; live on? You may just as well&#xD;
help me about my sewing, as to take it in on your own hook.&#xD;
IL have more calls than II can possibly attend to. And&#xD;
besides, my eyes are not as strong as they once were. I&#xD;
can't sew of evenings~ any more excepting on the plainest&#xD;
parts, an~your help will be ,a great accommodation to me.&#xD;
It will enable me to serve all my customers. So if you&#xD;
will just take hold and lend me a hand whenever you feel&#xD;
like it, and allow me to pay you what it's worth, I assure&#xD;
you it will not only be some assistance to you, but 'twill&#xD;
actually put money in my pocket too."&#xD;
"Thank you! thank you! Mrs. Maddock. Then I&#xD;
will do the nicest parts and you the plainest, for my eyes&#xD;
are perfectly strong and good yet."&#xD;
"Agreed, that's a nice arrangement. Butt you mustn't&#xD;
try your 'eyes too much and spoil them while you're a&#xD;
young woman. You shall have one of my lard lamps in&#xD;
here. I have two,. and the girls. and I never use but one&#xD;
nt a time. 4They give a bright light and then they're very&#xD;
economical. You 'can burn any kind of grease in them,&#xD;
and that saves the expense of oil,"&#xD;
'Susan thanked her again, and said she hoped there&#xD;
would come a time when~ she should be able to repay' some&#xD;

&#xD;
of this kindness, and the conversation ended with Mrs.&#xD;
Maddock's 'commanding her never again to speak of obli-&#xD;
gation.&#xD;
This worthy woman's kindness did not stop here.&#xD;
Scarcely a day passed without ?ome token of her interest in&#xD;
the Elmers. A pie or a cake for the children. And often&#xD;
a bit of fish, an egg, or some other little delicacy for, the&#xD;
old woman. ~nd every morning a pitcher of milk.&#xD;
"You will at least take pay for the milk," said Susan,&#xD;
almost imploringly.&#xD;
"Bless your soul aiid body, dear woman," Mrs.' Mad-&#xD;
dock replied, "do you think I shall be ~ny the poorer in&#xD;
a hundred yeai~s for giving you a little milk? I never sell&#xD;
milk to anybody that's worse off. than I am. My cow's a&#xD;
first-rate animal. I make all my own butter and have&#xD;
several pots to spare every fall. And when a rich family&#xD;
wants to buy milk of me, why I take the piiy-of--~-course.&#xD;
But as for selling milk to poor folks, I can't do that. 'My&#xD;
mother before me never did it, and I never will."&#xD;
"Your mother must have been very good."&#xD;
"Good! I never' saw the like of her. I didn't know&#xD;
how good she was when I was a young, giddy girl. It&#xD;
wasn't so much by what she said as by what she did, that&#xD;
she showed her goodness. But after she was dead and&#xD;
gone I began, to realize it. And when I was married and&#xD;
went away, and saw more of the world, then it struck me&#xD;
how much better my mother was than most of people. And&#xD;
when my family began to gzow up rom~d me, and I had&#xD;
my own trials and troubles, I remembered how many my&#xD;
mother had, and how patiently she 'bore them. 0~ how sor-&#xD;
ry I felt that I hadn't been more dutiful and loving ~to ber.&#xD;
So I tried to do as she used to, for I remembered her ac&#xD;

tions better than her words. And rye tried to keep them&#xD;
always before me. But if I should live hundred and fifty&#xD;
years I neVer should come to be what my mother was."&#xD;
Susan looked at the poor wreck upon the bed, and&#xD;
thanked God in her heart that she too had been reared by&#xD;
a good mother, and was now privileged to sustain and care&#xD;
for hers in that state of helplessness9&#xD;
Notwithstanding Mrs. ~Maddock's unvarying kindness,&#xD;
there were some circumstances which rendered Susan's situa-&#xD;
tion rather unpleasant to one of her temperament. The feel-&#xD;
ing of dependence which constant~j.weighed upon her spirit,&#xD;
was jncreased by a si1spicion~ that the two older daughters&#xD;
of Mrs. Maddock were not satisfied with her being there.&#xD;
they were good-tempered girls, and there was never any-&#xD;
thing rude or unkind in their deportment towards herself.&#xD;
But occasionally .a hasty expression to her children esQaped&#xD;
them. And once, as she was passing through the enti~y~&#xD;
she heard one of them say to the other,&#xD;
"I' tl;iink we have children enough of our own without&#xD;
keeping other people's. I should think she might put&#xD;
Mart out." Susan did not blame th~ girls. She thought&#xD;
it natural that they should feel so. But it made her very un'T&#xD;
happy. She had not thought of putting Mary out before,&#xD;
and it Wrung her heart. But she felt the necessity of doing&#xD;
something. If Mrs. Lee were only~ home.. She knew&#xD;
that she might count upon help from her. She was almost&#xD;
sure that she would have been glad to take Mary, and tbat,&#xD;
she could have borne, for Mary loved Mrs. Lee, and would&#xD;
no doubt have been happy with her. But she was gone,&#xD;
and there was no 'one who knew when she would be back.&#xD;
While she was in this state of perplexity, an opportunity&#xD;
offered for getting Mary a place, and she embraced it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Not without many secret tears, still in the hope that the&#xD;
separation would not be long. The child her~eIf was at&#xD;
first unwilling to go. She could not bear to leave hei&#xD;
mother and Johnny, and above all the baby. And then&#xD;
too, Mrs. Smith, with whom she was going to live, was&#xD;
not a bit like ~Mrs. Lee. She did not look as pleasant.&#xD;
If it was Mrs. Lee she would be willing to go and 'live&#xD;
always with her.&#xD;
But her mother talked long and seriously to her.&#xD;
"You are a little girl, 'Mary," she said, "but you are&#xD;
old enough to see that I have to work very hard ~to get&#xD;
clothes and food -for you all. Mrs. Smith offers to feed&#xD;
and clothe you, which is very kind. And in return you&#xD;
are to help tare care of her biLby, just as you do of your&#xD;
own little brother. Don't you see that will be helping me&#xD;
very much?"&#xD;
When the little girl understood that it would bej relief&#xD;
to her mother, she became il~econci1'ed to the idea ongoing,&#xD;
and the next morning, after a great many kisses all round,&#xD;
and numerous hugs administered to the baby, she set out&#xD;
for Mrs. Smith's, with a basket on her arm containing 'her&#xD;
small wardrobe, and Sarah Maddock to show her the way.&#xD;
"I don't half like the looks of that Mrs. Smith where&#xD;
Mary's gone," said Mrs. Maddock to her daughters.&#xD;
"Nor I," said Martha.&#xD;
"Nor I neither," said Anne. "I should be\very sorry&#xD;
if the -little thing wasn't Well treated, for she's a good&#xD;
child."&#xD;
Both the girls fdt some compunction for having wished&#xD;
her away; and they made amemids afterwards by constant&#xD;
kindness to Johnny and the baby.&#xD;

the one before, mentioned, wife of the man who had made&#xD;
~his fortune in California, no longer "Jonathan Smith the&#xD;
shoemaker," but "J. Pixicy- Smith, the leather merchant~"&#xD;
The exact amount of Mr. Smith's acquisitions in California&#xD;
was ~not known; but to judge from the change in his out.&#xD;
ward circumstances since his return, it must have been&#xD;
considerable. He was doing business on a pretty large&#xD;
scale; and' Mis. Smith, from a small, unpainted house,&#xD;
where' she "did her own work," was elevated to a tall, red&#xD;
brick one, with bright green window blinds, and there,&#xD;
reigned over a hired girl and also a baby nurse. An ex-&#xD;
tract from a letter which she wrote about this time to a&#xD;
sister in 'Vermont, will give some idea both of the woman&#xD;
and her mansiofl:&#xD;
"'It's but of brick painted reds three story high, and&#xD;
very tall chimberly tops, and a fuller kitchen in the base-~&#xD;
ment underneath. The upper story we haint furnished&#xD;
more than to put shades to the windows to make a show&#xD;
on the~~ou~side, but the first and second stories is complete.&#xD;
I've g6t two parlors with folding doors between 'em; the&#xD;
frorrt parlor is furnished with mahogany chairs and a sofa&#xD;
cushined with hair'cloth, and a looking glass bigg enough&#xD;
ito see the 'whole of yourself in, and two ottermans, anda&#xD;
splendid 'centre4able with a tremenjous bigg astorial lamp&#xD;
in the middle of it. The mantletry shelf is supported by&#xD;
xn~rble pillows, and atop of it stands three Jo, Randals, the&#xD;
middle one nearly a yard high, with rising of a hundred&#xD;
diamond dependents hanging from it.' Over the sofa hangs&#xD;
Mr9 Smith'~ portrait as natural as life, and the windows&#xD;
has gold' cornishes as much as a foot wide, and musling&#xD;
curtings of the most costliest description. And tl~e carpets&#xD;
I i~ouldu't describe if I shc~old try forever, 'they "being alike&#xD;
&#xD;
in both parlors, and all covered with magnificent flower&#xD;
pots bright enough to dazzle common folkses eyes. In&#xD;
the back parlor stands Henrietta's pianb; we calculate tO"&#xD;
have her learn music; then there's two tater tates, yo*u&#xD;
know what they are I spose, and chairs and mantletryasheif&#xD;
like them in the front parlor, on Which staiids'a n~imber of&#xD;
pappy Mash ornaments, that's very fashionable nowj You&#xD;
never saw any like em, they being intirely~new fashioned,&#xD;
and named after the inventor, old Mr. Mash. I shouldn't&#xD;
wonder if it 'was the one we used to~know, he was always&#xD;
inventing something you. know, and a number more things&#xD;
of various descriptions. At the. lower end I calculate to&#xD;
* have a family' picture to hano~; it's. nearly done now, and&#xD;
Mr. Boggles is a painting it'; you can imagine how supe-&#xD;
rior it is when I tell you that we shall have to pay twenty-&#xD;
five dollars for it. It represents the four oldest children a&#xD;
standing up in a row; Ferdinand stands first with a book&#xD;
in his hand, J'Ienrietta next with a bokay, Josephine next,&#xD;
a holding her doll, and Columbus last a drumming-on his&#xD;
little drum. On one side sits me a holding the babe, J.&#xD;
Pixley Junior in my arms. In the foldi~ig doors stands one*&#xD;
of these Elizabeth Ann chairs, that's considered so undis-&#xD;
pensable in every genteel -parler at the present time, with&#xD;
a high-pinted back and cushined with red -velvet, and very&#xD;
uneasy if a body ever wanted tc~ set down in em, but they&#xD;
don't. We calculate to have the house heated by a furniss&#xD;

MARY EL MEl? , OR&#xD;
other dust; it seems to open some folkses eyes all of a sud-&#xD;
~ding, instid of blinding em. "I keep a bigg girl that does&#xD;
the heft of my work, and have to pay her a dollar a week;&#xD;
and besides her I've got a small one to take care of J. Pix-&#xD;
Thy, and I get a good deal out of h~r and it's all clear gain,&#xD;
for all IL pay her is her clothing and vittals, and the cloth-&#xD;
'lug aint much, as I shall make her wear the girls' old&#xD;
things; the food is something, for such children eat aw-&#xD;
fully, but I watch her pretty close; she's only seven year&#xD;
old but I never saw a child of that age so handy with a&#xD;
babe. A good deal 6C the furniture I've described, husband&#xD;
bought to a vandue in New York, very cheap indeed, but&#xD;
don't you never breathe a sillyble about it to no living crea-&#xD;
ture, but come as soon as convenient and see how we look&#xD;
in our new residence."&#xD;
When little Mary arrived' at Mrs. Smith's, Sarah took&#xD;
her ~t&amp;amp; the basement door and then left her. She knocked&#xD;
and ~Vas told to come in. There was no one in the kitchen&#xD;
excepting the hired girl,~ who was washing up the breakfast&#xD;
things. She was an odd looking girl, almost as dark as a&#xD;
squaw, with a flat nose and a long chin. She was cross-&#xD;
eyed too, and her stiff black hair was cropped close to her&#xD;
head. Mary was almost frightened when she first looked&#xD;
at her. 'But when she spoke in a pleasant voice and asked&#xD;
if" this was the' little girl that was to live there," her fears&#xD;
subsided% and she answered in the affirmative.&#xD;
"Well then ,~ take off your things and I'll put them up&#xD;
stairs; you'll sleep with me."'.&#xD;
Mary surrendered her bonnet and cape, as well as her&#xD;
basket to the queer-looking girl, who patted her head and&#xD;
said, "How nice your hair curls! is it natural ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
* "Natural?" said the little" girl inquiringly.&#xD;
"I mean do you roll it up in papers, ~or does it curl&#xD;
itself?"&#xD;
"0, it ourls itself. I didA't know what you meant at&#xD;
first."&#xD;
" Well, that's beautiful. Now I suppose you must go&#xD;
up stairs to Mrs. -Smith's room. No need of my going&#xD;
with you; right up this stairs and then along the hall, and&#xD;
into the room where you hear a dreadful hullabaloo.~~&#xD;
These directions enabled Mary to find the room without&#xD;
difficulty. She tapped at the door, but was not heard.&#xD;
So she opened it and, went in. Such was the commotion&#xD;
inside that her entrance was unnoticed. The two girls&#xD;
were disputing furiously' about Josephine's sun-bonnet,&#xD;
which she declared henrietta had hidden. Columbus, a&#xD;
boy about three years old, was stamping about in an old&#xD;
pair of his father's boots, and Mrs. Smith, baby ~,jn arms,&#xD;
was standing at the window, knocking and screaming at&#xD;
Ferdinand, the eldest hope, who was loitering in the street,&#xD;
instead of going to school.&#xD;
"You do know where it is, and you know you do," said&#xD;
Josephine. '&#xD;
"I don't neither, a'nd you know I don't."&#xD;
"You lie, and you know you lie."&#xD;
"I don't lie, you lie yourself. Say ma! shan't she give&#xD;
mc up my sun-bonnet? I want to go to school."&#xD;
"I don't care whether she does' or not," shouted Mrs.&#xD;
Smith turning quickly round. "I'm half crazy with this&#xD;
everlasting racket; go to school, sun-bonnet or no sun-&#xD;
bonnet." And she gave them each a hearty box on the&#xD;
ear and pushed them out of the door, while phey xetaliated'&#xD;
by calling her a" mean old thing," "old cross-patch," &amp;amp;o.&#xD;

As. Mrs. Smith opened the doer to eject the girls, 'she&#xD;
perceived little Mary, who stood trembling behind it.&#xD;
"'0 you've come, have, you? well, I'll attend to you&#xD;
soon." She then seized Columbus and shook him violently&#xD;
with the hand she had at liberty..&#xD;
" What do you mean, you little scamp, clattering round&#xD;
in them boots'! get out of 'em quicker ;" and she lifted&#xD;
him up by the arm so that the boots fell off. The boy&#xD;
bawled lustily.' At 'this moment Mr. Smith entered the&#xD;
room, evidently much 'excited.&#xD;
"At it again hey ~" said he. "You're always abusing&#xD;
that boy. ~Lumruy, my~son, come with pa," taking hold of&#xD;
his arm..&#xD;
Mrs. Smith did not relax her gripe on the other arm.&#xD;
The boy was a constant bone of contention between his&#xD;
parents.&#xD;
"I wish," she said, "you wouldn't always interfere&#xD;
when I'm a trying to correct him, Mr. Smith."&#xD;
"A~nd I wish yQu'd be good enough to let ~o of hi&#xD;

As the mother labored 'under a disadvantage on account&#xD;
of one arm 'being occupied with J. Pixley, 'Junior, she was&#xD;
in the end co~npel1ed to yield, and the affectionate father&#xD;
led his son off in triumph to the "leather store."&#xD;
Poor little Mary, to whom such scenes were new, was&#xD;
nearly frightened out of her wits at it, and felt quite re-&#xD;
lieved to find herself alone with Mrs. Smith and the baby.&#xD;
Mrs. Smith was a tall, poking woman, with a sallow com-&#xD;
plexion, and a long, sharp nose. She turr~ed to Mary as&#xD;
soon as 'the coast was cleared, and oi'dered her to go to the&#xD;
kitchen and tell Jerusha to send her a 'basin of water, right&#xD;
from the pump to wash the babe. Mary obeyed, and after&#xD;

sending her to fetch half a dozen more things, Mr~.&#xD;
Smith was ready to begin the ablution of J. Pixley.&#xD;
He was a very fat baly, with cheeks hanging down on&#xD;
his shoulders, and a pointed head, crowned on the summit&#xD;
with a tuft of stiff, black hair about an inch long, which&#xD;
stuck up straight in spite of all his mother's efforts with&#xD;
comb and brush, to make it lie down. Little Mary's first&#xD;
movement was to run up and stand by Mrs. Smith, as she&#xD;
always did by her mother when she washed their baby.&#xD;
"What makes' him cry so?" she asked. "Our b'aby&#xD;
never does when he's washed."&#xD;
"Well, I shouldn't wonder if your ma takes the chill&#xD;
off the water. Some folks don't know any better, but it's&#xD;
no way. I always wash my children in the colde~t' water&#xD;
I can get, and in the summer I put a chunk .oC ice in it."&#xD;
Mary no longer wondered that J. Pixley cried, nor that&#xD;
his skin was so red. She noticed whenThis mother put on&#xD;
his clothes, that she pinned his waist bands as tight as she&#xD;
could possibly draw them, and she concluded that this was&#xD;
done to push up the flesh and make his cheeks fat.&#xD;
"How funny his hair looks," remarked the child in the&#xD;
simplicity of her. heart. "It doesn't curl round like our&#xD;
baby's, his i~ real pretty; it goes so;" and she described&#xD;
several half circles with her finger on J Pixley's head.&#xD;
K Mrs. Smith never forgave her this speech. She glanced&#xD;
spitefully at the little girl's head, covered with those short&#xD;
golden rings which are so beautiful in childhood, and which&#xD;
art cannot imitate7 thinking as she did so, of the stiff, mud..&#xD;
colored locks of her own children, and after a moment she&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"So you think curly hair's mighty pretty? Well I don't&#xD;
agree with you. I'm glad he hasn't got curly hair,. nor&#xD;

any of the other children. It looks so nigger. If your&#xD;
ma expects me to fuss With yours as she does, and keep&#xD;
it ~quirled up in that ridiculous way, she's mistaken."&#xD;
"My -mother doesn't fuss with, it. She only combs it&#xD;
out in the morning when I get up," said Mary, in some&#xD;
alarm, fearing that she had done something wrong.&#xD;
"You talk too much child, "said Mrs. Smith sharply.&#xD;
When she had finished J. Pixley's toilet, she laid him&#xD;
in the cradle still screaming, and told her to rock him to&#xD;
sleep.&#xD;
"And if he won't go to sleep so - take him up and&#xD;
walk with him till he does; do you hear?"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am," answered Mary.&#xD;
"And then sit down on that stool by the cradle and&#xD;
sew on this till he wakes up. You can sew some, can't ~&#xD;
you? you're old enough anyhow."&#xD;
Mary answered that she could sew a little on coarse&#xD;
things, and she took from Mrs. Smith's hand a towel begun&#xD;
to be hemmed.&#xD;
as soon as he wakes, -let me know; do you -&#xD;
hear?"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am," said the child, and then Mrs. Smith&#xD;
went into the kitchen.&#xD;
Mary rocked the cradle, 'singing the while a childish&#xD;
tune. There was something in her voice and manner&#xD;
soothing to the poor baby after his mother's rough hand-&#xD;
ling, and he soon ceased crying and fell asleep without&#xD;
Qbliging Mary ~to take him up. And then the little nurse&#xD;
began her sewing. She felt very sorrowful, as she sat on&#xD;
the little stool in that strange, disorderly rooih, and thought&#xD;
of the angry words she bad heard, and the angry faces she&#xD;
had seen there, and ~then of her own home where all~was so&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
T this moment the little girl was startled by a&#xD;
strange noise under Mrs. Smith's bed, and pres-.&#xD;
ently a large Newfoundland dog emerged,&#xD;
stretched, shook himself, and looked round. As&#xD;
soon as he caught sight of the strange child sitting by the&#xD;
cradle, he showed his- teeth, and uttered a low growl.&#xD;
Poor. Mary was dreadfully terrified. What should she&#xD;
do? If she were to stir or cry out, he might spring at&#xD;
her and tear her to pieces before any one could come to&#xD;
her rescue. Therefore she bethought herself to try coax-&#xD;
ing. She remembered to have seen her father once con&#xD;
ciliate a ferocious dog in this manner, when she was out&#xD;
with him; and so, frightened as sh~ was, she ventured ~to&#xD;
speak to him.&#xD;
Poor fellow-! poor old fellow."&#xD;
The dog relaxed his countenance somewhat, and came a&#xD;

few steps i~earer. She spoke again, in a low, sweet&#xD;
vo1c~.&#xD;
"Doggy, good doggy, y@u won't bite a poor little girl,&#xD;
will you?"&#xD;
The dog advanced close to her side. She took courage&#xD;
and patted his back, though her hand trembled a little,&#xD;
still talking in the same pleasant way, and very soon the&#xD;
creature sat down and laid his head caressingly on her lap.&#xD;
Little Mary was greatly relieved, and resumed 'her sewing.&#xD;
This animal had a great antipathy to children past the age&#xD;
of infancy; caused, undoubtedly, by his having been cpn~&#xD;
stantly teased and worried by the little Smiths. lie was&#xD;
the terror of all the urchins in the neighborhood, who&#xD;
would scamper off whenever they saw him. He was not&#xD;
accustomed to kind ~woi'ds, and they had a magical, effect&#xD;
upon him, when uttered by Mary's sweet, child-like voice.&#xD;
So~ from this time, Bounce and the lade girl were th~ best&#xD;
of friends.&#xD;
When Mrs. 'Smith came in 'shortly after, she 'was ex-&#xD;
ceedingly surprised at the phenomenon which met her eyes.&#xD;
'After her astonishment had in a measure subsided, she in-&#xD;
quired "how that dog came there." Mary 'answered that&#xD;
'he came' from under the bed.&#xD;
"Well, how came he'to be so friendly with you?"&#xD;
"I don't know, indeed," said Mary, "only I thought&#xD;
he was going to bite me, so I said, 'poor fellow,' and&#xD;
talked to him, and after awhile he came up to m~ very&#xD;
good."&#xD;
"So you've been coaxing him, hey! Well, I'll let you&#xD;
know I didn't get y~u here to play with the dog; here~&#xD;
Bounce, get outyou nasty quadrupled;" and she assisted&#xD;
him with her foot to obey the command.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
The commotion awaked the baby, whereupon' his&#xD;
mother took him up, and then ordered Mary to "fly&#xD;
round and put the room to rights." The child was very&#xD;
expert at "putting to rights," for she had been taugj~it to&#xD;
assist her mother in this way, but she never before had&#xD;
quite so unpromising a field to work upon.&#xD;
how can I ever get it to rights?" thought she; " it&#xD;
is so dreadfully to wrongs." But what with her own ideas&#xD;
of propriety, and Mrs. Smith's instructions where to plane&#xD;
tide, and how to fix that, she~-did at length succeed in get-&#xD;
ting the room into a state something like order; a 'nearer&#xD;
apprQach ~to it in fact, than had been achieved in a lono'&#xD;
time.&#xD;
"I-hereafter," said Mrs. Smith," I shall expect you to&#xD;
do this every morning without being told; d'ye hear?"&#xD;
Mary answered in the affirmative, and then her mis-&#xD;
tress told her to bring on her sewing, as she wanted to see&#xD;
what sort of work she made of it. Mary' brought it to&#xD;
her, and she ,at once pronounced it "distress-ed," the'&#xD;
stitch s, she said, were a foot long - she wondered that a&#xD;
great in like her couldn't sew better, and 'ordered her to&#xD;
take m re pains in future. Mary said ~' she could sew&#xD;
a good dea better when she had a thimble, but she had&#xD;
not brought hers.&#xD;
"So you haint fetcht no thimble, hey? Well, it's curi-&#xD;
ous your ma didn't think of it. Shouldn't wonder if you&#xD;
hadn't any.",&#xD;
"0, yes ma'am, I've got a nice silver one, that father&#xD;
gave me on my last bivt~hday before he went away.~~&#xD;
"Silver thiiHble for a young one like you that's all the&#xD;

"But mother said when it's outgroWn I can gi~ve\ it to&#xD;
some little girl that's littler yet than I. So I mean t give&#xD;
it to Hannah Fenno, she's oniy four, and when she gets&#xD;
too big for it, she ~'can give it to little Ellen, and after&#xD;
Ellen, little Maria, that's a baby now can have it, and so&#xD;
you see it never'll- be lost."&#xD;
"' Well, I declare! I did not know there was anybody&#xD;
so green in creation! give away a silver thimble, when&#xD;
you can't get vittals to eat~ nor clothing to cover your&#xD;
surfisses. But it's a mystery to me that your ma didn't&#xD;

"I suppose she didn't think you'd want me to 'sew."&#xD;
"Didn't, hey~? I wonder what she calculated to have&#xD;
you do all the time the babe's asleep; hold your hands and&#xD;
play lady?"&#xD;
To this question the child made no reply, but she ven-&#xD;
tured' to ask if she might go home and get her thimble.&#xD;
"There! jest as I knew wouldd be, ready to jump at&#xD;
any excuse to trot home. But I'll tell you wkat, Mary&#xD;
Elmer, once~ for all I tell you, and do you listen to me&#xD;
and remember'what I say. I aint a going to halve no run-&#xD;

no, not every day, of course; but only' once in a&#xD;

idly.&#xD;
"Yes, yes," responded Mrs. Smith, snappishly. "You&#xD;
couldn't exist I s'pose, without seeing that elegant curly-&#xD;
beaded cherubim once in a while. And then wouldd be&#xD;
so interesting to me to have you come back and ding-dong&#xD;
it into my ears the rest of the time. A wonderful help&#xD;
you'd he to me in such a case.' No, you aint to go home&#xD;
at all, I give you to understand. D'ye hear?"&#xD;

TRIALS AND CHANCES.        203&#xD;
&#xD;
Mary would have answered, bu~ something came up in&#xD;
her throat and prevented her. She tri~d to choke it&#xD;
down, inwain, and after a moment she burst into teari.&#xD;
"You 'great cr~-baby," said Mrs. Smith; "1've a&#xD;
great mind to send you home ~and let you all starve to-&#xD;
gether, or go to the poor-house."&#xD;
These words alarmed the child, and she said hurriedly,&#xD;
"0, don't. send me home, Mrs. 'Smith, mother cannot&#xD;
provide for us all. I'll tl7y to be good, I won't cry any&#xD;
more.~~&#xD;
Mrs. Smith was graciously pleased to be mollified at&#xD;
these prQmis~es, and after giving Mary a lecture touching&#xD;
her future conduct, dwelling at large on the poor-house&#xD;
and starvation in case of any act of disobedience, and her&#xD;
own kindness in being willing to save her from such a&#xD;
fate, she brought out Josephine's thimble for her t6 use&#xD;
until she could have an opportunity to send for her own.&#xD;
She soon after told her to take the "babe" into the&#xD;
kitchen for his dinner. Mary obeyed, and Mrs. Smith&#xD;
followed.&#xD;
In the kitchen Mrs. Smith passed the greater portion&#xD;
of her time. She was unaccustomed to servants, and&#xD;
wholly ignorant of the proper manner of treating them.&#xD;
She had not the slightest confidence in Jerusha. Not be-&#xD;
cause she had any reason to doubt the girl's honesty, but&#xD;
because she regarded all "hired girls" as the natural ene-&#xD;
mies of their employers, and ready to take advantage of&#xD;
every opportunity to defraud them. She therefore. kept&#xD;
up a system of petty esjj~onage over all Jerusha's move-&#xD;
ments, both to see that she did not purloin or waste any-~&#xD;
thing, and to be sure that she was constantly busy, and&#xD;
- not trying to slight or "shirk, off" her work.&#xD;

&#xD;
Therefore, whether she had anything to do in the&#xD;
kitchen or not, she was generally there; for the most part&#xD;
gossiping with Jerusha, and asking her all sorts of ques-&#xD;
tions about families where she had lived, which the girl,&#xD;
"like many others when encouraged, was ready enough to&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
Occasionally, however, Mrs. Smith 'was visited with an&#xD;
attack of reserve. A sudden sense of her own greatness&#xD;
and importance as mistress of the house, came over her,&#xD;
and she determined tQ let Jerusha "know her, pla~."&#xD;
At such times her bearing towards her drumstick, " as she&#xD;
called her, was dignified in the e4reme. She 'moved&#xD;
about with a queenly air, and although she continued her&#xD;
visits to the kitchen as~ usual, 'she always brought with her&#xD;
"' Thaddeus df Warsaw" (the only book in the house), ~&#xD;
and pretended to read while she *kept a good look-out&#xD;
upon Je~usha. These attacks occurred just after she had&#xD;
received a call or an invitation from soine one whom she&#xD;
considered genteel, or after a spat with Jerusha, which ~as&#xD;
no rare occurrence. Jerusha, 'who was a shrewd girl, and&#xD;
knew the difference between a "lady ~" and "no lady,"&#xD;
was both provoked and amused at these "genteel fits," as&#xD;
she called them.&#xD;
But' let us not forget J. Pixlcy's dinner. This consisted&#xD;
of a large' quantity of mashed potato well buttered, the&#xD;
soft part of a huge piece of apple~pie, and a bowl of&#xD;
milk. Mary thought it a "funny" dinner for a baby of&#xD;
ten months nbt yet weaned, but she 'did not dare to say&#xD;
'so.&#xD;
While she was feeding him the children came in from&#xD;
school, and 'a terrible uproar~ ensued. The girls. made&#xD;
themselves merry for a while in commenting~, upon little&#xD;
&#xD;
Mary's appearance; particularly ~her curly golden hair,&#xD;
which they considered vastly inferior to their "own mud.-&#xD;
coL~red pigtails, and then fell to quarreling as usual,&#xD;
while Ferdinand amused himself by jogging her elbow, to&#xD;
make her spill 'the baby's food. Tbb poor child was&#xD;
frightened at the conduct of the great rude boy, and was&#xD;
just on the point of crying again, when the 'entrance ~f&#xD;
Bounce diverted the young gentleman's attention from her.&#xD;
The dog had barely time to run up and gree( his new&#xD;
friend with a wag of his tail, when the same tail was&#xD;
seized by Ferdinand, who began to drag him about the&#xD;
room by it. '~ Bounce neVer would bite his master's chit..&#xD;
dren, but he often barked and snarled terribly under their&#xD;
treatment. At this indignity he sent forth a succession of&#xD;
yells which\ alarmed Mary, although she did not blame&#xD;
him at all. The yelling of the dog, the shouts of Ferdi-&#xD;
nand, an~d the boisterous quarreling of the two girls, cre-&#xD;
ated a concert such as the quiet little creature had never&#xD;
heard before.&#xD;
",Get out o' the house every live soul of you," screamed&#xD;
Mrs. Smith. "I can't stand this racket, and' I won't&#xD;
stand it." Then seeing that the children 'did not start,&#xD;
she seized a broom exclaiming, "If you won't go I'll&#xD;
make you go," and drove them forth into the back yard,&#xD;
with orders to stay there till dinner was ready.&#xD;
And then Jerusha proceeded to s~et the table. They&#xD;
ate in the kitchen. The dining-room was only used when&#xD;
they had company. While Mary was yet feeding the&#xD;
baby, Mr. Smith returned from his store dragging along&#xD;
Columbus; who was roaring at the top of his voice.&#xD;
"If ever I take this boy to the store again "- thus&#xD;

far had Mr. Smith proceeded, when Mrs. Smith broke&#xD;
in.&#xD;
"I wonder what's the reason you're forever tormenting&#xD;
that child. Lummy, my son, what's pa been doing to&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"He's been shippingg me," blubbered the cherub.&#xD;
"Whipping you, hey ~ Mr. Smith, I should' like to&#xD;
know what business you have to whip this boy?"&#xD;
"I whipped him because he deserved it; he's done&#xD;
more mischief at the store this morning than his neck's~.&#xD;
worth, confound limIt"&#xD;
"Mischief, hey ! tha1~s a likely story! come here to ma,&#xD;
Lummy, darling 1"&#xD;
Columbus obeyed, and took refuge in his mother's lap;&#xD;
and then turning to ~h~s father, said with an air of great&#xD;
satisfaction,&#xD;
"E ce,, ya ya, I don't tare for you."&#xD;
Dinner was now ready, and little Mary was not sorry&#xD;
when Mre. Smith sent her back in the bed-room with the&#xD;
baby, to1 wait. until they were 'through. She was begin-&#xD;
fling to feel very hungry, but she thought she would&#xD;
rather go without her dinner altogether, than to sit down&#xD;
with the children, to say nothing of their parents. When&#xD;
at last she was called out to dinner, there was no one there&#xD;
beside Mrs. Smith, Jerusha, and Columbus, who was still&#xD;
at the table, being always allowed to sit and stuff huin~elf&#xD;
as long as he chose. Mrs. Smith took the baby, and mo-&#xD;
tioned Mary to - not a seat, but a stand by a very dirty&#xD;
plate which one of the children had used. Jerusha, who&#xD;
had dined (she always ate with the family excepting when&#xD;
they had company), offered to wait upon the little girl,&#xD;
but Mrs. Smith declined, saying she would attend to her&#xD;
&#xD;
herself. She then put a large potato on her plate, cut it&#xD;
up in chunks, and sprinkled #salt over 'it. To this she&#xD;
added a very small piece of meat, 'and then told Jerusha&#xD;
to take' off the dishes. In obeying this~order, the girl, as&#xD;
she took up the bread plate to take it away, offered it to&#xD;
Mary. Mrs. Smith pushed it quickly from her, saying,&#xD;
"She don't need bread with her potato."&#xD;
Mary did want a piece of bread, but she dared not to&#xD;
say so. There was a 'small piece of pie left on Jerusha's&#xD;
plate. To tell the truth she had reserved it on purpose&#xD;
for little Mary. She handed the plate to her, saying as&#xD;
she did so, "Would you like this hit of pie?"&#xD;
Mary thanked her, but-before she had time to take it&#xD;
Mrs S. said with much excitement,&#xD;
"Columbus may want that."&#xD;
"He's got more on his plate now than he can manage,&#xD;
and he's as full as a tick already," said Jerusha.~ "And&#xD;
besides it's a piece I saved' a purpose for her," and she&#xD;
slipped it off on Mary's plate.&#xD;
"Jerusha U' said Mrs. Smith, turning v~ery red with&#xD;
anger. "W'hen I said I'd attend to her myself, I meant&#xD;
so. And I wish you'd mind your own business, and .not&#xD;
go to loading down her plate and stuffing her with vittals&#xD;
you haint any right to."&#xD;
"I didn't mean to stuff her," replied Jerusha, "I&#xD;
thought there was no harm in giving her that little piece of&#xD;
pie."&#xD;
"Don't you know that such children will always make&#xD;
themselves sick overloading if their food aint: portioned&#xD;
out to 'em. It was for her good, of course, that I didn't&#xD;
want she should have the pie."&#xD;
"And for Columbus's good too, I s'pose that ~you&#xD;

wanted he should have it, I don't know why 'taint as bad&#xD;
for him to overload a~ for Mary."&#xD;
As soon as Jerusha had 'delivered this speech, she began&#xD;
to sing, the way in. which she usually terminated the fre-&#xD;
quent spats between herself and Mrs. Smith, for whom&#xD;
sh~ had not the smallest respect.&#xD;
After this~scene, our little Mary was too much frightened&#xD;
to eat the pie, and taking the baby returned to the bed-&#xD;
ioom, (Mrs. S. had not yet learned quite enough* of gem-&#xD;
tility to call it "the nursery,") Mrs. Smith banged after&#xD;
her, enraged at not being able to have the last word with&#xD;
Jerusha. On reaching that apartment she threw herself&#xD;
down in the rocking-chair, rocked furiously for a few&#xD;
minutes, then jumped up, took down "Thaddeus 'of&#xD;
Warsaw," from a shelf in the closet, and banged back into.&#xD;
the kitchen.&#xD;
During, the afternoon Mary had only occasional glimpses&#xD;
of her, when she came and poked her head in at the door to&#xD;
see. how matters stood there, to administer a warning or&#xD;
threatening word to the poor little nurse, and then hastened&#xD;
back to her favorite post. It was a doleful afternoon to&#xD;
the child. The baby fretted 'almost constantly. Mary&#xD;
thought his overloading bad something to do with it. It&#xD;
rained and therefore he could not be taken out in his little&#xD;
wagon. She tasked all her powers to aniuse him. She&#xD;
talked to him, sang to him, took him to the window and&#xD;
tried to interest him in the sights outside. But the dhly&#xD;
way that she could quiet him at all, was by carrying him&#xD;
up and down the room.&#xD;

&#xD;
he screamed so tremendously that it brought his mother&#xD;
from the kitchen, and she crave Mary a terrible scolding&#xD;
for "letting him lie, there and cry." Mary said she had&#xD;
only laid, him down a little' while to rest her arms.&#xD;
"Time enough for that when he's asleep," said the affec-&#xD;
tionate mother, "don't you let me catch you doing so&#xD;
So Mary took him up and~ walked with him; up and&#xD;
down, up a~d down, until she felt as though her ankles&#xD;
would break and her arms drop off. At last it occurred.&#xD;
to her how very tightly his mother had pinned his 'clothes&#xD;
in the morning, and she thought that after si~cli a dinner as&#xD;
he had ~eaten they mirst be verjr~uncomfortable. She ven-&#xD;
tured to examine. They were very tight indeed, she could*&#xD;
hardly get her finger under them. She knei~ he mkzst be&#xD;
suffering on that account, and after some hesitation she de-&#xD;
termined to loosen them if possible. ' This was no light&#xD;
task for her, but she 'accomplished it after a time. She&#xD;
carefully extracted the pins. But when she had got them&#xD;
all out, and begun to put them in again, her fingers&#xD;
trembled a little, she was so fearful of pricking the baby.&#xD;

Geor~ey's? I'm ~o afraid I shall hurt you."&#xD;
But she did not hurt him. He was much more quiet&#xD;
,while she was undoing and doing him over, and when she&#xD;
had finished, his cries ceased entirely. Mary had really&#xD;
done this nice little piece of work as well as any grown&#xD;
perso; ccluld, and the child was completely relieved. He&#xD;
stretched his limbs out to 'their full extent, and~seemed de-&#xD;
lighted to be able' to do so. Indeed, Mary fancied that he&#xD;
looked up gratefully in her face, and she felt an interest in&#xD;

the homely little thing, that she had not felt before. She&#xD;
kfssed him, and he tried to return the caress, then laying&#xD;
his cheek against hers fell asleep in a few moments.&#xD;
"Dear baby," said Mary as 'she laid him in his cradle,&#xD;
"how glad you are to be made comfortable; perhaps you&#xD;
will. get to love me though your mother doesn't, but 0&#xD;
how tired I am!" And throwing herself on the floor at full&#xD;
length, she stretched out her arms aiid enjoyed for a few&#xD;
minutes the luxury of resting.&#xD;
"I must be careful not to test too long," she thought,&#xD;
"or Mrs. Smith wilhcome and be angry with me. I'll&#xD;
be up directly and go td my sewing." But "directly" she&#xD;
began to, think it was very pleasant to lie so, and then she&#xD;
had a confused idea ~f not caring whether Mrs9 Smith came&#xD;
in or not, and then - she was. asleep.&#xD;
Fortunately Mrs. Smith did not coAie in during her ~~Pt&#xD;
which was soon cut short by a great noise under the&#xD;
window. It was the young Smiths 'returning from school9&#xD;
She was at fkst alarmed to find that she had been asleep,&#xD;
but was~reassured on seeing the baby just as she left him,&#xD;
and sitting down on her little stc~ol began to sew. She&#xD;
had just finished one end of the towel when the baby waked,&#xD;
- ~nd she took him into the kitchen for his supper, as Mrs.&#xD;
Smith had directed. The family were taking tea.&#xD;
"I was in hopes that young one wouldn't wake till we&#xD;
got through," said Mrs. Smith, as she began to prepare&#xD;
his supper, for which he was clamoring loudly. This meal&#xD;
fully ~quallea his dinner in quantity, although it differed in&#xD;
quality; being a bowl of crackers and milk, accompanied&#xD;
by a lai~ge ginger-cake. She placed them on a stand near&#xD;
the tea.~table, where she could keep an eye upon Mary,&#xD;
and see that she did not "eat it half up herself," and then&#xD;

the little girl sat down, and began the prQcess of stuffing&#xD;
the infant Pi~dey.&#xD;
While ~rs. Smith was lool~ing round to watch Mary,&#xD;
Columbus, who sat in a high chair near her, reached- out&#xD;
to help hir4iself to something, and in so doing turned over&#xD;
her tea-cup. She gave him a ringing box on the ear,&#xD;
called him ~t "tormented tyke," and was in the act of - ptit-&#xD;
ting him down from the table, when his father interposed,&#xD;
caught him up, chair' and all, carried him round and seated&#xD;
him next f~o himself, saying it was shameful to cuff a child&#xD;
fqr a mere accident.&#xD;
Columbus, finding himself in security, cast a look of ~&#xD;
ultation at his mother, and pouting out his lips informed&#xD;
her that he didn't tire for her! The three elder children,&#xD;
who bad successively undergone the same process of traim.&#xD;
ing in their earlier childhood, and who gave daily and&#xD;
hourly evidence of its legitimate effects, applauded the boy's&#xD;
spirit with such expressions as these: "That's you, Luni !"&#xD;
"Stand up for your rights! " "Give it to her!" Fer-'&#xD;
dina~~-even went so far as to propose" Three cheers for&#xD;
Lum!" -&#xD;
Mr. Smith was highly delighted at this piece of wit, and&#xD;
laughed heartily ; but Mrs. Smith, not viewing it in the&#xD;
same light, t6id Ferdinand to "hold his tongue." This&#xD;
command the young gentleman 9beyed literally,, by thrust-&#xD;
ing out that member and taking it between his thumb and&#xD;
finger; at which performance the merriment of the young&#xD;
ladies became excessive. Mrs. Smith stormed, Mr. Smith&#xD;
escaped to the storeand the " table broke up in confusion."&#xD;
Mrs. Smith then removed the cakes and apple-sauce&#xD;

and a little apple-sauce left on her husband's plate, she&#xD;
plastered the latter on the bread, and placing a cup of&#xD;
'water beside it, took the baby from Mary and told her to&#xD;
go and eat her supper3 Jerusha did not interfere although-&#xD;
she 'looked.~ round several times as though she wondered&#xD;
why Mrs. Smith did not go to her'own room with the baby,&#xD;
as -she usually did directly after tea, there being nothing on&#xD;
the table to require her attention. Mrs. Smith, however,&#xD;
did not take the hint, but remained~ until Mary had eaten&#xD;
her small allowance, and then giving her the "babe," sent&#xD;
her back to the' bed 'room, where she found that the two&#xD;
girls had preceded her. They had called Bounce in, and&#xD;
when Mary entered were adjusting an old shawl over his&#xD;
back, at which the dog was greatly ahnoyed.&#xD;
One corner of the shawl had a hole in it. This they&#xD;
drew over his tail, and having tied the other two corners&#xD;
round his neck, pronounced it a first-rate saddle. Bounce&#xD;
did not, sUbmit ~patiently, but growled and snarled all the&#xD;
"time. "'The girls, however, knew by experience that his&#xD;
growling when directed at them meant nothing, and so they&#xD;
continued to tease him in every possible way, and to laugh&#xD;
and shout at hi~ vain efforts to disengage himself from the&#xD;
shawl. Mary felt very sorry for the poor creature..&#xD;
"0 girls, don't plague him so," said ~e, "see~how&#xD;
bad it makes him feel."&#xD;
"Who told you to stick in your gab?" said Henrietta.&#xD;
"' Who cares if it does make him feel bad?" said Jo-&#xD;
sephine.&#xD;
Mary ventured to say' that she cared, and again besought&#xD;
them to take the shawl off.&#xD;
'~ Just hear her, Jo," said Henrietta, "what business is&#xD;
'~it'~bf hers what we do?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Sure enough, the little nasty pot -wrastier ," responded&#xD;
the amiable sister. "Come, Hen, let's set him on to her."&#xD;
This proposition was received by Hen with great glee.&#xD;
"Seek her, Bounce, seek her!" she said, clapping her&#xD;
hands, and pointing at the little girl. The dog turned and&#xD;
looked at Mary. It was not such~ look as that with which&#xD;
he had greeted her in the morning, but one of supplication.&#xD;
It seemed to say "Will you not help me? or do you mean&#xD;
to join my tormentors?"&#xD;
"Go it, old fellow! seek her!" cried both the 'girls,~&#xD;
clapping their hands with renewed vigor.&#xD;
"Poor Bouncey! poor Bouncey!" 'said Mary, in those&#xD;
sweet low tones of hers, which had 'already won him.&#xD;
As soon as he heard her voice, he ran directly up to her&#xD;
and licked her face, uttering at the same time a pleading&#xD;
oan. She immediately went to work to extricate him&#xD;
'fr~i the shawl. A rather difficult task because of the&#xD;
b~b~on her lap. But she succeeded after a few moments,&#xD;
to the great delight of the dog. He jumped about licking&#xD;
her face and hands, and also bestowing his caresses upon&#xD;
the baby, whom' the sagacious creature had discovered to&#xD;
be the 'object of her care, much to the astonishment of Hen&#xD;
and Jo, who bad witnessed the scene in silent wonder.&#xD;
J~ist then Mrs. Smith came in and, seeing Bounce,&#xD;
demanded angrily "who let that dog in there."&#xD;
"Mate let him in," said Henrietta without hesitation,&#xD;
at the same time winking at Josephine.&#xD;
"0 no, no, 'Mrs. Smith," said Mary. "I didn't let&#xD;
him in, did I, Josephine?"&#xD;
"Indeed you did, and you l~now you did," answered&#xD;
that unscrupdous young lady.&#xD;
"And you lie if you sayyou didn't~," chimed in Henri-&#xD;

&#xD;
"You little hussy "- began Mrs. Smith.&#xD;
" Now I guess you'll catch it, Mate," said Jo (Mate&#xD;
was the euphonious nickname which the children had&#xD;
given her). -&#xD;
- "0 how can they say II did it?" sobbed the poor child,&#xD;
as the tears rushed to 'her eyes; "he was here when I&#xD;
came in and they were putting the shawl on him."&#xD;
In her agony she appealed to flounce himself.&#xD;
"Don't I tell the truth, Bounu ~ I didn't let you in,&#xD;
did I?"                                       /&#xD;
Bounce could only wag his tail in reply, at which the&#xD;
girls laughed immoderately and said it meant "yes, you&#xD;
did." Mrs. Smith 4tutned him out, and then catching&#xD;
Mary by the shoulder, and shaking her almost hard enough&#xD;
to dislodge J. Pixley from her lap, addressed her thus:&#xD;
"So you expect me to believe you against both the girls&#xD;
do you you good-for..nothing little hussy! Didn't I&#xD;
tell you this morning that I wouldn't have that dog in&#xD;
here? )Vhat possest you to let him in - say?"&#xD;
Mary ~ould scarcely articulate "I didn't let ~him in."&#xD;
"-Don't tell me such~a lie as that," screamed Mrs. Smith,&#xD;
giving her another and harder shake, while the girls looked&#xD;
on with entire satisfaction.&#xD;
"she didn't let him in, ma," said Columbus, issuing&#xD;
from his sister's bedroom adjoining, whither he had gone&#xD;
on a voyage of discovery like his famous namesake.&#xD;
"What have you been doing in there, you little plague?"&#xD;
exclaimed both the girls, hoping to prevent his giving any&#xD;
further information. But Mary too, had caught his&#xD;
words, and said imploringly,&#xD;
"You know I didn't let him in, don't you, Lummy?"&#xD;
"Yes, I know you didn't do it. Hen letted him in,&#xD;
&#xD;
she opened the window and tailed him in. Jo tailed him&#xD;
too." -&#xD;
Before this speech was finished the girls had vanished.&#xD;
Mrs. Smith saw at once that the J~oy spoke the truth, and&#xD;
that her daughters had told a lie. But she said nothing&#xD;
to make amends to the poor child who had suffered so&#xD;
severely in consequence of it. She commanded Lummy&#xD;
to "stop his talking'" and -then saying it was time to&#xD;
undress the "babe," took him from Mars's arms and told&#xD;
her to p~it Coluz4us in bed. He slept in a crib in the&#xD;
girls' room. - At first he utterly refused to go, and his&#xD;
mother had just announced her intention to "give it to&#xD;
him," as soon as she was done with the baby, when Mary&#xD;
induced him to comply by promising to tell him a pretty&#xD;
story, which promise she faitl~ifully kept by relating the&#xD;
wonderful history of "Mother Hubbard and her door"&#xD;
which had such a soothing effect upon Columbus that he&#xD;
was asleep before it was finished.&#xD;
When Mary returned, Mrs. Smith was ready to deliver&#xD;
up J. Pixley to her charge to be walked to Bleep. She did&#xD;
not notice the loosening of his underpinning, which gave&#xD;
his little nurse the courage to go through with the process&#xD;
of relieving him thus as often as she f6und him suffering&#xD;
from being pinned too tight.' She then ~nt to the kitchen&#xD;
where she had "something to do." This something the&#xD;
reader will, perhaps, fancy to - have been a boxing and&#xD;
scolding of her girls for the lie they had told her. By&#xD;
no means. This grievous sin was passed over without a&#xD;
reprimand without even an allusion to it, when every&#xD;
day she punished her children for faults that were nothing&#xD;
in comparison with it.&#xD;

~ ARY walked with the baby for some time but he&#xD;
showed no signs of sleepiness, his 'afternoon ii~p&#xD;
had made him wakeful. He was quiet, however,&#xD;
and at length she ventured to lay him down&#xD;
awake, for to. say the truth, her arms could hold out no&#xD;
longer. When Mrs. Smith came back nearly an hour&#xD;
afterwards, with a candle,. she found Mary and the baby&#xD;
*   both fast asleep, the latter on her little stool with her head&#xD;
~resting against the cradle for it was long after her ordinary&#xD;
bed-time. Mrs. Smith was vexed with herself for not&#xD;
having left a light that Mary might have gone on with her&#xD;
sewing.! She roused her with two or three smart raps on&#xD;
her back, called her a lazy thing," and scolded her&#xD;
roundly for" shirking" in that way when she might have&#xD;
gone and got a candle and sewed, instead of snoozing away&#xD;
the time. ~Mary was too worn and sleepy to ~omprehend&#xD;
all that Mr~&amp;amp; Smith said, and rubbing her eyes she asked&#xD;
if she might go to bed.&#xD;
"You may as well," returned Mrs. Smith, "for I see&#xD;
plainly you aint a going to be. good for anything in the&#xD;
evening; come along~ you're to sleep with Jerusha."&#xD;
She led the way up the back stairs, to a desolate look~&#xD;

* chair. Some nails were stuck round in the beams for&#xD;
b;iiging clothes on, and several of them were appropriated&#xD;
by Jerusha's scanty wardrobe.&#xD;
Mary's own little basket sat on the floor. ill one corner,&#xD;
Jerusha had. carried it up. Mary was nota co~rard, JJ~i~&#xD;
she had that dread of strange, Jonely sleepiffg rooms which&#xD;
is natural to childhood; and she inquired timidly whether&#xD;
Jerusha would b&amp;amp;up soon.&#xD;
"What, you aint afraid I hope," said Mrs. Smith, "a&#xD;
gr~at girl like ~y~ou afraid of 4he 'dark! I'm ashamed of&#xD;
you. Come! be spry, take off yotirclothes~ndji~mnp iii.&#xD;

Then lying down again she comforted herself with the&#xD;
thought that if she tried to be good and do right always,&#xD;
God wouhj take care of her, and in the end all would be.&#xD;
well. With this feeling, she soon dropped asleep.&#xD;
Not~ long after, Jerusha came in. She stepped softly&#xD;
up 'to the bedside, and holding the stump of a candle&#xD;
which she carried so as to reveal the 'face of the sleeper,&#xD;
she looked at her for a moment. The tears were still&#xD;
standing on the~ quiet face, although. her last waking&#xD;
thoughts had left a peaceful expression there.&#xD;
"' What a pretty little creetur!" thought Jerusha. "I&#xD;
almost hate t~ wake her, she must be so tired."&#xD;
She then put down the candle, and touched the child's&#xD;
forehead lightly, at the same time pronouncing 'her name.&#xD;
"Mother! mother! did you call me I" said Mary,&#xD;
opening her eyes and fixing them wonderingly upon quite a&#xD;
different face' from her mother's.&#xD;
"Don't be frightened," Jerusha said gently. "It's&#xD;
'only me - Jerusha to bed."&#xD;
"Q; yes, I know now. 'I thought I heard my mother&#xD;
calling me."&#xD;
"I guess you was'dreaming about your mother."&#xD;
"Perhaps 'I was."&#xD;
"Don't you feel pretty tired? "&#xD;
"'Yes, quite tired, the baby is so heavy.'~&#xD;
"And some hungry too, aint 'you? I know I often feel&#xD;
quite hungry after I've worked hard all' day."&#xD;
'"Yes, I do feel 'rather hungry."&#xD;
"' Well take~ this; 'taint a good thing to go to bed&#xD;
hungry." And she drew prom her pocket one'of the large&#xD;
ginger-cakes that had been on the table at tea, her own&#xD;
allowance, which had 'found its way from her 'plate to her&#xD;
pocket, while Mrs. Smith was overhauling Columbus."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Thank you, Jerusha," said the little, girl with evident&#xD;
pleasure. "Did Mrs. Smith know you brought it to me?"&#xD;
"She saw me take it, eat it -up, you'll feel the better&#xD;
for it." 'So Mary 'sat up in bed sand ate the cake with a&#xD;
good appetite while Jerusha was undressing~ In the ful-&#xD;
ness of her gratitude, she said,&#xD;
"It was very good in you Jerusha to think to bring me&#xD;
something."&#xD;
"Law no. I only reckoned you might like a mowful;&#xD;
I can fetch you something amost every night, but you&#xD;
needn't say nothing about it, for Ferdinand would make&#xD;
fun of us for eating in bed you know."&#xD;
Jerusha . had perceived Mary's fear and dread of this&#xD;
odious boy, and thus availed herself of it. to prevent the&#xD;
child's exposing her. Not on her own account however.&#xD;
As. far as she was concerned, she would not' have cared&#xD;
a straw if Mrs. Smith had found it ~out, but she feared&#xD;
Jb ringing trouble upon ,the little girl who already had&#xD;
enough to bear.&#xD;
Jerusha, rough and coarse~ as she was, bad good im-&#xD;
pulses, not often drawn out, it is true, in such a life as&#xD;
hers. had been. She was naturally affectionate,~but she&#xD;
had never been treated with affection, in fact she had never&#xD;
met with real kindness. She was an orphan. Her easiest&#xD;
recollections were associated with an almehouse from which&#xD;
she was taken when very young by a farmer's wife who~&#xD;
felt no greater interest in her welfare than did Mrs. Smith&#xD;
in Mary Elmer's. She was knocked about and treated&#xD;
with much less kindness than the domestic animals of the&#xD;
establishment. Compelled also to perform drudgery, both&#xD;
in and out of doors, which would have been too hard for&#xD;
even a stout boy. Never spoken to by her mistress in any&#xD;

but a harsh, commanding tone, and on account of her ugly&#xD;
face and ungainly figure made the constant subject of the&#xD;
coarse jibes and jests of the men about the farm, who&#xD;
gave her the name of '~ handsome Josh," it is no wonder&#xD;
that'Jerusha developed into a very disagreeable, sulky girl.&#xD;
Many of I~Irs. Marsh's 'visiting acquaint~~ces wondered at&#xD;
Mrs. Marsh for keeping her, and that lady herself declared&#xD;
she "only did it out of pity, for she was awfullV tried with&#xD;
the creetur." But it is not our pui~ose to relate Jerusha's&#xD;
history at length. Let it suffice to' say that when about&#xD;
fifteen, she contrived to run away, and by dint of begging&#xD;
along the road, now a meal and now a ride, in the course&#xD;
of a few days she had travelled more than a hundred miles.&#xD;
She cared not where she vent. Her oi~1y wish was to go&#xD;
far enough to escape forever from Mrs. Marsh. She did&#xD;
not yet consider herself entirely safe, but being very weary&#xD;
she determined to stop for a few days at a certain large&#xD;
town and if possible earn enough to carry her as far as she&#xD;
wished to go. She presented herself at numerous doors&#xD;
with the question, "Do you want to hire?" but her ap..&#xD;
pearance always called forth an unhesitating negative, until&#xD;
she applied, almost discouraged, to the keeper of a very&#xD;
Iarge~ hotel, where servants were always in requisition.&#xD;
She had so little confidence, and had learned to think her-.&#xD;
self such an object of disgust, that she was quite surprised&#xD;
when the proprietor, after a few questions to ascertain her.&#xD;
capacity, 'engaged her for a month. When he inquired&#xD;
what wages she wished, she answered,&#xD;
"0 anything you please; I never worked for wages&#xD;
and don't know 'what I ought to~ have."&#xD;
Lie Looked at her for a moment with some surprise, but&#xD;
not being over serm~tpulous about his hired people if they&#xD;
&#xD;
but did their work well, he asked no further questions,&#xD;
but' conducted her into the kitchen where she was soon&#xD;
hard at work.&#xD;
Here for a while she experienced the same treatment&#xD;
that she had always endured elsewhere. She was the butt&#xD;
of all the servants, both male and female. But she never&#xD;
answered ~igain. In fact she never spoke at all excepting&#xD;
as her work required it. She was silent, and always busy.&#xD;
At length they ceased to annoy her, or to try to penetrate&#xD;
the mystery which surrounded her, and left her to herself.&#xD;
That important personage, the "head cook," I should&#xD;
have said before, had appreciated her from the first. Je-&#xD;
rusha's business was to assist her, and she protested that she&#xD;
had never before known a young girl so faithful, or one who&#xD;
would do half as much hard work in a day; without corn.-&#xD;
plaining too. The work was indeed hard, but compara.-&#xD;
tively light to the' poor girl' who had been accustomed to&#xD;
such arduous tasks 'as 'were exacted from her at Farmer&#xD;
Marsh's. The accounts of her usefulness' and industry&#xD;
rendered by this functionary to the master and mistress of&#xD;
the establishment, made them very desirous to retain her&#xD;
after the expiration of the month, and Jerusha would will-.&#xD;
ingly have stayed now that she ha4. become contented 'in&#xD;
her new situation, ~nd found herself giving satisfaction,&#xD;
had she not a few days previously caught a glimpse of a&#xD;
man who was a near neighbor and intimate acquaint..&#xD;
ance of the Marshes. He was just driving away from the&#xD;
door as Jerusha came out to draw water, amid did not see&#xD;
l)er. But she had been very uneasy ever since, and deter.-&#xD;
mined to 'push on farther as soon as her month was up.&#xD;

&#xD;
and the cook was still more peremptory.. But the girl&#xD;
continued firm. At length th~ mistress said with some&#xD;
asperity, that it did not look altogether right for her to be&#xD;
so anxious to leave a place with which she appeared to be&#xD;
satisfied. Jerusha felt hurt that Mrs. Mayhew should&#xD;
entertain any suspidons of her, and~very sorry to be thought*&#xD;
ungratefuL to the first persons who had ever treated her&#xD;
with any consideration. She knew that she had done noth..&#xD;
ing wrong in 'escaping from Mrs. Marsh's tyranny, so she&#xD;
requested Mrs. Mayhew *to step aside with her a little&#xD;
while and~ frankly told her painful story.&#xD;
"0 Mrs. Mayhew," she said in conclusion, "do you&#xD;
think I would willingly leave the first place where 'I wa~&#xD;
over used like a human being, if I wasn't afraid evei~y min&#xD;
ute o1' being found out and forced back to that awful place&#xD;
where I'm bound to sfay till I'm eighteen~"&#xD;
Mrs. Mayhew saw at once the truth of Jerusha's story&#xD;
and appreciated her anxiety to be still farther removed from&#xD;
danger, andshe no longer opposed her going. She com~~&#xD;
municated it to her husband who agreed with her, and so&#xD;
Jerusha was permitted to depart in peace, with several&#xD;
presents from Mrs. Mayhew and more money in the shape&#xD;
of wages from Mr. Mayhew thaii she had ever expected to&#xD;
possess at one time. The head cook was inconsolable and&#xD;
gave her a new gingham apr~n, and the other female ser-&#xD;
vants who had for some time felt compunction of conscience&#xD;
for their' treatment of a poor girl who evidently had some&#xD;
sorrow at 'heir heart, came~ forward and affectionately bade&#xD;
her good-by, which they accompanied each with some lit-&#xD;
tle keepsake. Mr. Mayhew also kindly 'advised her as to&#xD;
her coi~rse, and the place which he designated as the one&#xD;
where she would probably be as much out of danger as&#xD;
&#xD;
* ~nywhere~ proved to be our own thriving town. She ac-&#xD;
cordingly came hither. But we have already gone much&#xD;
farther into her history than was our original intention and&#xD;
must rapidly despatch it.&#xD;
It was not the poor wanderer's good fortune to fall into&#xD;
the hands of any 'of those benevolent characters who are&#xD;
found in every city. or village; five years had passed since&#xD;
she came here, and she had never experienced the treatment&#xD;
which she met with at the hotel. Wherever she had lived,&#xD;
her life haq been rendered a burden to her by the insults&#xD;
and jests which were constantly heaped upon her. In&#xD;
many instances she was defrauded of her wages, and knew&#xD;
no means of redress. She of course became constantly&#xD;
more unamiable and surly. She regarded every one as an&#xD;
enemy, and, herself as an object of disgust and hatred to all&#xD;
the world. Mrs Smith had hired her because she could&#xD;
obtain her services at two shillings, less by the week than&#xD;
those of any others to whom she had applied. And now&#xD;
let us return to the, forlorn little' garret room where we left&#xD;
our two girls.&#xD;
Mary readily promised to say nothing about eating in&#xD;
bed; "indeed she'd not tell of ~t and have Jerusha laughed&#xD;
at by such a naughty boy as Ferdinand." After' Jerusha&#xD;
had lain down, Mary said innocently,&#xD;
"You don't say your prayers until after you get in hod,&#xD;
do you?"&#xD;
Jerusha, not knowing what else to reply, said, "No."&#xD;
* "Well, I always say mjn&amp;amp;before I lie down when rm&#xD;
with my mother; we kneel down, Johnny and I, beside&#xD;
her and say them. But to night, what do you think! I&#xD;
forgot it. I forgot to say my prayers until after I'd 2been'&#xD;
in bed a great while. Wasn't. I wicked? And then I&#xD;

&#xD;
_ had to say them where I was, for I was afraid to get out&#xD;
of bed in the dark in this strange place.. But I must stop&#xD;
talking and give yow a chance to say yours."&#xD;
After 'waiting a few minutes, and perceiving that Jeru-&#xD;
sha was, silent, she said,&#xD;
" Do you say'your prayers to yourself?"&#xD;
Jeriish~ hesitated a moment, and then answered frankly,&#xD;
but with so petulance,&#xD;
"No, I don't say any prayers; I never had anybody to&#xD;
learn me."&#xD;
".Had you no father or mother?"&#xD;
"Not as I remember of."~&#xD;
"Who took care Of ~QU when you were little?"&#xD;
"Nobody. I lived in a poor-.house."&#xD;
"Poor-house I dreadful I that's where Mrs. Smith says&#xD;
I shall go if I don'$ be, good and mind her. It's. an awful&#xD;
place, isn't it?"&#xD;
Not so awful as some places where I've lived since."&#xD;
"Where hava you lived since?"&#xD;
"I~verywhere, and 'nowhere that anybody ever cared&#xD;
for me, and so let's go to sleep and not talk any more."&#xD;
"But I care for you," said the child, putting her arm&#xD;
round' Jerusha. *" I care for you, and I'll learn you a&#xD;
prayer; not my little one, but 'Our Father;' one that's&#xD;
meant for everybody, big and little, to say; wouldn't you&#xD;
like to learn it?"&#xD;
"I don't believe I can learn it if I try."&#xD;
"Yesyou can if you say it over after me as I did after&#xD;
my mother when I learnt it."&#xD;
And so little 'Mary 'began saying the~tord's prayer,&#xD;
pausing after each petition for Jetusha' to repeat it after&#xD;
her, which the girl did very correctly, and when 'it was&#xD;
concluded, Mary said,&#xD;
&#xD;
"0 you can learn it very easy. If we repeat itso every&#xD;
night, after a little while you can say it all alone, and' that&#xD;
will be so nice!"&#xD;
Then the fair and lovely little one raised her bead and&#xD;
kissed the forlorn, forsaken creature beside her, and a mo-&#xD;
ment after was sleeping sweetly. The first kiss that had&#xD;
ever been imprinted upon that distorted face. The effect~&#xD;
was wonderful Jerusha had from the first moment that&#xD;
she saw the child felt an unusual interest in her; but now&#xD;
/ she knew that there was a bond between them which never&#xD;
would be broken. And she vowed to herself to protect&#xD;
the little girl 'to the utmost of her power. She loved Mary&#xD;
with the first affection that had ever warmed her 'icy heart.&#xD;
Long did she lie awake; new and strange thoughts were&#xD;
in her mind. She wondered whether she had ever been as&#xD;
innocent as the child beside her. She was almost sure she&#xD;
never was. And then she wondered what she ~ho~ild have&#xD;
been with a mother to guide, and teach, and love her in&#xD;
childhood, and she pitied from her heart the little creature&#xD;
who was~ compelled to. be separated from so excellent a&#xD;
parent as it was evident Mrs. Elmer must be'.&#xD;
"How entirely different she is," thought Jerusha,&#xD;
"from these Smith children! It's plain enotigh~ she's had&#xD;
quite another sort of bringing up. Poor thing! She'll&#xD;
have enough to bear here. I'll do all I cam for her, but&#xD;
dear me! that won't be much among such a set."&#xD;
The next morning as soon as Jerusha was dressed, she&#xD;
called Mary, and after telling her that she need not hurry&#xD;
her head off, went down and left her. So' the little girl&#xD;
threw on her clothes, said hei prayers and followed.&#xD;
When she reached the kitchen she found a basin of water&#xD;
in the sink to wash herself,~ and a clean, coarse towel; her&#xD;

own towel, Jerusha told her, and no one else should use&#xD;
it, and she would always find it in one particular spot,&#xD;
which she showed her. Mary thanked the kind girl, who&#xD;
then fastez~ed her clothes, and combed her hair neatly.&#xD;
Not long after, ding, dong, went Mrs. Smith's bell. Mary&#xD;
obeyed the summons, and going to the bedroom where the&#xD;
infant J. Pixley. was roaring in his cradle, was order~ by&#xD;
his mother to take him into th~ kitchen till she got dress&#xD;
*But we are not intending to accompany our little hero-&#xD;
ine through another day at Mrs. Smith's, for all succeeding&#xD;
days varied but little from the first. Every day brought&#xD;
with it the same round of wearying labors, of vexations and&#xD;
insults from the children, and harshness, nay, even abuse&#xD;
from Mrs. Smith; and every night the same stolen kind-&#xD;
nesses from Jerusha, who at the end of a week could say,&#xD;
"Our Father" without any h6lp from her little teacher.&#xD;
Afterwards they repeated it together.&#xD;
Susan Elmer was surprised, that Mary did not come&#xD;
home sometimes, and growing anxious about her, went&#xD;
one da~ to'Mrs. Smith's to seethe child. Mary was de-&#xD;
lighted, and would have thrown herself into her mother's&#xD;
arms, but the pres&amp;amp;nc~ of Mrs. Smith restrained her. The&#xD;
latter gave ~.o many plausible reasons for not allowing&#xD;
Mary to go home; such as ~the fear of its making her dis-&#xD;
contented, her extreme anxiety that she should be happy&#xD;
and contented, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c., that S~s~n was reluctantly com-&#xD;
pelled to acquiesce. Mrs. Smith treated Mary with&#xD;
unusual kinchiess in Mrs. Elmer's presence; hut a mother's&#xD;
eye i~ quick, and Susan ~aw clearly by the child's counte-&#xD;
nance th at.sh~ was not happy. She told Mrs. Maddock&#xD;
on he~ retur~i~~t she was convinced it ~as n~t just 'the&#xD;
place 'for Mary at Mrs. Smith's; but she lived in hope that&#xD;
&#xD;
something would turn up' ere .long, which would change&#xD;
the order of affairs. She scarcely acknowledged to herself&#xD;
that this something for which she looked .so ardently, was&#xD;
the return of Mrs. Lee.&#xD;
In this manner several weeks elapsed, and then a change&#xD;
took place in little Mary's circumstances, and unfortu-&#xD;
nately, not a change for the better. Mrs. SmitWs suspi-&#xD;
cions had been for some time excited By the 'rapid&#xD;
'disappearance of certain articles from Jerusha's plate at&#xD;
tea. At length, by very close watching, she actually saw&#xD;
the transfer of a buttered rusk and piece of cheese from&#xD;
plate to pocket.' It was indeed the poor girl's own por-&#xD;
tion. She was never allowed'to take anything twice, and&#xD;
this piece of self-denial she daily practiced to keep her little&#xD;
fiworite from starvation.'&#xD;
Mrs. Smith said, nothing. ~She pretended not to see,&#xD;
but she determined to find out "what became of the&#xD;
victuals."~ She therefore kept her eye on Jerusha all th&amp;amp;'&#xD;
evening, but discovering-nothing, she followed ~stealthily&#xD;
up stairs soon after the girl went to her room. She bent&#xD;
her ear'close down to a crack round the door, and heard&#xD;
Mary thank Jer~isha for the rusk and inquire whether she&#xD;
would not like 't~ eat a piece ~of it herself.&#xD;
"0 no," returned Jerusb~, "I dcm't want any; I&#xD;
brought it all for you."&#xD;
This was enough for Mrs. Smith. She opened the door&#xD;
suddenly, and stood before the ~two astonished girls, a&#xD;
perfect picture of' rage and maliceL,~&#xD;
"I've caught ye. at last I ~you nasty, underhanded&#xD;
snoops. I've long suspected this, and now I'm satisfied.&#xD;
What business 1~av'e you to be a stealing~ victuals to bring&#xD;
up here and stuff that young one? say I"&#xD;

&#xD;
Jerusha, who was somewhat alarmed at first, had time&#xD;
to recover her composure during this tir~k.&#xD;
"Stealing, did you say V' she aske~ looking the&#xD;
woman full in the face.&#xD;
"Yes,, stealing; carrying off my victuals unbeknown to&#xD;
me to feed that young one."&#xD;
"Mrs. Smith! I never stole a. mou'ful of victuals from&#xD;
you in all my life, apd you know IL didn't. Whatever I've&#xD;
brought to Mary. I've took from my own share, that you&#xD;
was willing&#xD;
her g I should have. I've robbed myself to keep&#xD;
from starving, joor little creetur! If that's stealing,&#xD;
I'll steal again."&#xD;
"You would, hey? You say that to my face, do ye?"&#xD;
"Yes, I do, and to any other face of clay you'll bring&#xD;
on."&#xD;
"You sassy, impudent trollop! quit the house this&#xD;
minute. I won't harbor ye no longer."&#xD;
"Very well, pay me my wages and I'll quit .to-night."&#xD;
"Wages! you're a pretty one to talk about wages!&#xD;
Not a ~red cent do you get out o' me, after such conduct."&#xD;
~" So you don't mean to pay what, you owe me? Mrs.&#xD;
Smith, I've worked hard and faithfully here for three&#xD;
months, and you've only paid me for the first month of the&#xD;
times I sha'n't leave the house till ii get the rest that's due&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Sha'n'they?"&#xD;
~" Non sha'n't."&#xD;
"Well, I guess we'll see who's mistress here."&#xD;
'With these words Mrs. Smith slammed the door fu..&#xD;
riously and. went down stairs. During this colloquy, little&#xD;
Mary lay buried under the bed-clothes, trembling from&#xD;
head to foot. 'As goon as Mrs. Smith was fairly gone,&#xD;
she uncovered her head and said in great distress,&#xD;
&#xD;
"0, Jerusha, what have you done? What is Mrs&#xD;
Smith going to do? What will become of me if you go&#xD;
away?"&#xD;
"Don't feel so bad, Mary," said Jerusha, beginning tQ&#xD;
undress. "I know well enough what she'll do; she'll be&#xD;
all over it by morning, and want me to stay."&#xD;
"0, I'm so glad."&#xD;
"Wait a minute. I sha'n't stay, if I get my wages,&#xD;
( and Mr. Smith won't dare to hold onto 'em, if she wants&#xD;
to ever so much; and I shall clear out 'in the morning."&#xD;
"0, how badly you make me feel! Th9re'~ nobody&#xD;
here that cares for me but you. Bounce does, but he can't&#xD;
do much for me. He likes to 'stay by me, and often&#xD;
growls at the children when they plague me. I know he&#xD;
would bite them if' they should lay a hand on me; but he&#xD;
isn't always by when~ they tease me. Baby loves me, too,&#xD;
but he isn't like you, Jerusha. 0, what shall Ii do?"&#xD;
"Jest so, that's the only reason why I hate to go, you&#xD;
poor little creetur. But maybe I can do something' for&#xD;
youafterlgo."&#xD;
"What can you do then?"&#xD;
"Why, if can't I do anything else, I can go'and tell&#xD;
your mother all about it, and she'll come and take you&#xD;
home. But I know she'd like to have you get a good&#xD;
place where they'd be .kind to you; and who knows but'&#xD;
what I can find you such a place?"&#xD;
"0, if you only could! Some place where they would&#xD;
let me go and see my mother when I want to, perhaps the&#xD;
same place where you go. But would Mrs. Smith let me&#xD;

MARY EL R~ OR&#xD;
&#xD;
After prayers, Mary, sobbed out, "0, how lonesome I&#xD;
shall be, sleeping here alone."&#xD;
"Don't you remember," said Jerusha, "what you said&#xD;
to Jo, t'other day, when she iyas bragging that nobody'&#xD;
saw her take that car~dy? yc~ said, '0, Jo, don't you&#xD;
know that God is everywhere, and sees all we do?"'&#xD;
"Yes, I remember, and how Jo laughed and made fun of&#xD;
me. But I'm glad 'you spoke of it, and I'll try to think&#xD;
about God watching over me, and the holy angels being&#xD;
around me every night when I come to bed."&#xD;
"And I hope it won't be many nights you'll have to&#xD;
think of it~ in this place."&#xD;
And then they went to sleep.&#xD;

CIIAPTEI~ VIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
HEN Mrs. Smith reached the. kitchen, she found&#xD;
T her husband there, and requested him to "go&#xD;
straight up stairs and turn Jerusha out ~of the&#xD;
house." He asked an explanation. She gave&#xD;
'it; whereupon 'he called her a fool for making a muss about&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"Don't ~you 'see,". he, said, "how 'twill work if you&#xD;
send her off? She'll 'blaze it all round, and the whole&#xD;
neighborhood will be up in arms about your starving the&#xD;
kelp. ~And now's the time,' you know, for us to be&#xD;
doing all we can to get into good society; and there's&#xD;

TRIALS AND CHANGES.&#xD;

&#xD;
some that's envious of us who'd be glad to make the most&#xD;
of it.~ And besides all that,' you can't get another girl&#xD;
that will work so 'well and so cheap as she does. I ad-&#xD;
vise you to pass it over, and let things go right on in the  t..&#xD;
morning as if nothing had happened."&#xD;
Mrs. Smith could but acknowledge that this would be the&#xD;
wisest course; and 'after indulging in a terrible out.pour-&#xD;
ing against Jerusha, and Mary, too, she concluded to adopt&#xD;
it. Accordingly in the morning she said nothing to Je-&#xD;
rusha about leaving, nor did the latter speak of it until&#xD;
Mr. Smith made his appearance, when she immediately&#xD;
asked him for the money due to her, saying that Mrs.&#xD;
Smith had told her to quit, and she wished to do so as&#xD;
soon as possible. Mr. Smith remonstrated, but she wa&#xD;
immovable. Even Mrs. Smith condescended to request&#xD;
'her to remain, and said c~ she'd got over her feelings."&#xD;
"Well, I haint got over mine," said Jerusha. "1&#xD;
can't stay another day in a house where I've been treated&#xD;
as I was last night."&#xD;
"'Well, you won't get any recommend," said Mrs.&#xD;
Smith.&#xD;
"I want none from you," replied 'Jerusha, with con&#xD;
tempt.&#xD;
her at length saw that he could do no less than pay&#xD;
the money, which he did with a very ill grape, and&#xD;
under a. storm 'of words from his wife, who protested&#xD;
"there was' no need of his paying a cent," &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
When Jerusba had received the money she went to her&#xD;
room, packed up her few articles in a 'bundle, and started&#xD;
off. Smith was standing in 'the outer door as she passed&#xD;
through, and said to~her, with' a look and tone intended&#xD;
to be very~ impressive, -&#xD;

232            MARY ELMER, OR                                   TRIALS AND CilAYGES.        233&#xD;
&#xD;
"Look here! the less you say the better."&#xD;
"Th~e better for you, I knoyv it," she answered, with&#xD;
great unconcern, as she too~ her way down the yard.&#xD;
Mr. Smith's emotions at this cool rejoinder, "may be&#xD;
better imagined than described."&#xD;
When she reached Mrs. Smith's bedroom window&#xD;
which looked out upon the side yard, she saw little Mary&#xD;
standing by it, baby in arms, and she knew that the child&#xD;
had stationed herself there to see, her when she passed, as&#xD;
her favorite post was by the window next the street.&#xD;
Mrs. Smith was still in the kitchen, brooding in impotent&#xD;
rage over her troubles. Mary's eyes were brimful of tears&#xD;
which she could not suppress, as she stood there waiting&#xD;
to see the last of her only friend. But Jerusha did not&#xD;
venture to stop and speak, for she knew that Mr. Smith&#xD;
was watching her, and feared that it might increase the&#xD;
little girl's trials if they were to hold any conversation.&#xD;
So she merely said in passing, -&#xD;
"Keep up, you'll hear from me soon.&#xD;
It~;was a sultry morning in August, when Jei\isha went&#xD;
forth, as she had often done before, homeless, friendless,&#xD;
and not knowing whither to go.&#xD;
"But first and foremost," she said to herself, as she&#xD;
slowly pursued he way. "Imust see if anythingcan.bc&#xD;
done for Mary. But dear me! where shall I go? I can't&#xD;
tell who'd be likely to treat her well; I'm sure I've never&#xD;
lived~ at any plaee here where I'd be willing to have her&#xD;
go, the precious little innocent creetur! Well, if I can't&#xD;
do anythingelse, I can go and tell her mother all about&#xD;
it, and she'll take her right home, better starve, there than&#xD;
at Smith's. If that Mrs. Lee she talks so much about&#xD;
was only at home, I'd go straight there. She's a good&#xD;
&#xD;
woman, I kn6w, and she would take her away. Who&#xD;
knows but she has got ~home? Any how, I can go see.&#xD;
So she retraced some of her steps, and turning a corner,&#xD;
went directly to Mrs. Lee's house. As she approached&#xD;
it, her courage rose on seeing the front windows thrown&#xD;
open. She went round to the back door and knocked,&#xD;
but no answer. As she4was about to repeat the knock,&#xD;
Peter Jackson, who was at work in the garden, and had&#xD;
seen her enter the gate, came round. In answer to her&#xD;
inquiries, he said that Mrs. ~4~ee would be home that very&#xD;
evening. She had sent word several days before, and he&#xD;
had been "given the house a good airen, to be ready for&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"0, dear!" exclaimed the disappointed girl; "I'm so&#xD;
sorry, I want to see her dreadfully."&#xD;
"Important business with the missus, has the young&#xD;
oman got?"&#xD;
"Yes, very important; but P11 be sure to come in this&#xD;
evening, rain or shine."&#xD;
She then pursued her way in search of employment,&#xD;
and at last offered herself at a large public house, where&#xD;
she h~uI never, applied before. It was a busy time with&#xD;
them. The court being' in session, the house full of&#xD;
boarders, and servants scarce; she was hired for a fort-.&#xD;
night, and no recommendation required. A hard, rough&#xD;
'place, but she was used to such places.&#xD;
As 500fl as Jerusha was out of the house, Mrs. Smith&#xD;
began to vent, her rage upon little Mary, whom she re-~&#xD;
garded as the cause of all her troubles. During the pro-.&#xD;
cess of washing the baby, she improved the time in pouring&#xD;
forth a storm of indignation against the child. ~Phe&#xD;
shrill tones of her voice, the incessant screaming of J.&#xD;

&#xD;
rixiey, the consternation of Mary, who ~~as flying abont&#xD;
; "setting to rights," altogether made it a "scene for a&#xD;
painter.'~ When the washing was completed, Mrs. Smith&#xD;
laid ~the baby in the cradle, and ordered Mary to finish&#xD;
hemming that apron, while. she was rocking him to&#xD;
sleep.'&#xD;
"As soon as it's done," she added, "come out in' the&#xD;
kitchen, there's plenty to do there now.~~&#xD;
And after dropping the curtain to shade the room,&#xD;
she went out, and Mary took her station by the cradle.&#xD;
There she sits, the patient young watcher, rocking the&#xD;
cradle with her foot, and while she sews, she sings too.&#xD;
"Husl~,niy dear, lie still and slumber,&#xD;
Roly angels guard thy bed,"-&#xD;
'The baby is very quiet now. His eyes are open still,&#xD;
but he' seems to be in a serene and comfortable state of&#xD;
mind. At length the lids begin to droop, Mary is watch-&#xD;

droQp lower and lower, so lower and 'lower are the tones&#xD;
of that childish voice', until they fall as gently on the&#xD;
baby's ear, as the "Heavenly blessings" she sings of, on"&#xD;
his head. And now they die quite away, for the baby is&#xD;
fairly in Dreamland.&#xD;
How fast those little fingers move over the hem! It is&#xD;
morning, a~nd 1the child is not 'yet worn' out with the' day's&#xD;
labor.. Besides, ~there is~ a hope in her heart. She~is&#xD;
thinking about Jerusha, and something whispers her that&#xD;
'deliverance is i~ot far off. ' Hark! she hears a noise, a&#xD;
very pleasant sot~nd. She paizses in her work a mou~ent&#xD;
and listens to it. She knows whence it proceeds, for she&#xD;
hears it almost every day. A young lady wh~ lives&#xD;

opposite teaches, a few scholars at her own home, and now&#xD;
these children are out enjoying their, pastime in the yard.&#xD;
Mary loVes to watch them at their play. It is next thing&#xD;
to being out at play herself. Many a time has she stood&#xD;
at the window with the baby in her arms, while her feelings&#xD;
entered warmly into their animated sports. She rises and&#xD;
steps softly across the ro&amp;amp;m, as softly as she can with those&#xD;
great chims~r shoes which were not made to~ftt, but to be&#xD;
grown into, and furnished from Mr. Smith's shop, who has&#xD;
plenty of leather on hand of course, but Mrs. Smith. "is&#xD;
not a going to be getting shoes every month for the hussy&#xD;
to bang out." In fact, she thinks it all nonsense for her&#xD;
to wear shoes at all, she wouldn't allow, it if she didn't sup-&#xD;
po~e her mother would make a fuss about it, if she should&#xD;
~happen to come in and find her barefooted.&#xD;
She raises a corner of the curtain and1 peeps out. how&#xD;
beautiful everything looks on this soft n~orning of the wa-&#xD;
ning summer I' especially that d6or-yard opposite. There&#xD;
are several fine trees in it, and the little girls are frolicking&#xD;
so merrily under them! A canary~-bird's'~ cage hangs&#xD;
from one of the branches, and he too, seems blithe and~&#xD;
contented in his little pr~on. And ever and anon, one of&#xD;
the number runs up and speaks to him, and he carols joy-&#xD;
ously back. And all the time the pleasant-faced young&#xD;
lady sits by her epen window regarding their sports, with-&#xD;
out appearing to be the slightest check upon their hilarity.&#xD;
And our little nurse rejoice~ too, as' all sweet innocent&#xD;
natures do in seeing others happy.&#xD;
She stands thus. for some minutes, with one hand holding&#xD;
out the~ curtain, and her head thrust a little way behind.&#xD;
Her sewing is in the other hand, and has not adVanced any&#xD;
since she came'to the window. She has; however, but an&#xD;

something prevents you. But something will prevent you.&#xD;

by the arm and furiously shaken.&#xD;
"You miserable, wretched hussy! this is the way you&#xD;

There! the blow has fallen! another ~! yet another!&#xD;
God of mercy, stop her! Hark! a ring at the door-&#xD;
bell -&#xD;
"There, run to the door, and be thankful for getting off&#xD;
so well."&#xD;
But the child has sunk on the floor and she 'does not rise.&#xD;
She is stunned and bruised. She did not even hear the&#xD;
bell.&#xD;
"Get along to the dooryou stupid thing you," (with a&#xD;
kick.)" Don't you hear the bell a ringing ?~"&#xD;
The child is on her feet now, but how changed! The&#xD;
bright and hopeful look which we saw on her countenance&#xD;
but now, is gone; an expression of agony ha~ taken its&#xD;
place. But beside this, there is something strange, some-&#xD;
thing never seen there before. The colorless lips are&#xD;
pressed closely together, and the blue eyes have an un-&#xD;
wonted fire in them. The crushed worm will turn soon.&#xD;
The little girl has not uttered a souiid, but her spirit is&#xD;
roused, and says within her, "It is enough, I will go to&#xD;
my mother, I \vill go~this very day if I can but escape."&#xD;
"Come, make haste for the door! and don't go scuffing&#xD;
along ~o; lift up your feet, can't ye? Show 'em into the&#xD;
front parlor, if it's a laily."&#xD;
When 'Mary reached the door, she opened it to a pleas-&#xD;
ant-looking, handsomely dressed lady, who hiquired for&#xD;
Mrs. Smith. There was but one thought in Mary's mind&#xD;
then, - how to escape, instead of answering immediately,&#xD;
she laid her hand on the lady's arm, and looked up into her&#xD;
face with a strange pleading expression, that surprised her&#xD;
not a little. But she did not speak.. After a minute or&#xD;
two, the lady said,' -'&#xD;
"' Did you not understand memy child? Is Mrs. Smith&#xD;

&#xD;
Then the little girl recovered herself, and was frightened&#xD;
that she had dared to be so free with a stranger, ~and she&#xD;
answere~l quickly, and led the lady to the parlor.&#xD;
When she annoiimced to Mrs. Smith the name of Mrs.&#xD;
Bennet Squires, the former experienced no slight degree&#xD;
of elation at the honor of a visit from so distinguished a&#xD;
personage, for Mrs. Bennet Squires was, in fact, tJ~ie leader&#xD;
of the ton in our town.&#xD;
"Dear me 1" she exclaimed, "so she's condescended&#xD;
to call at last. Well, I'll~ let her know I'm as good as she&#xD;
is, any how."&#xD;
So she hastened to change her dress for a flaring plaid&#xD;
silk,. stuck on her fabe front, with a very, elaborate, un-&#xD;
tasteful cap above it. She had plenty of her own hair,&#xD;
hu2t it was beginning to turn gray which she considered a&#xD;
great disfigurement, and always concealed on important&#xD;
occasions, either with an ugly dye, or a still uglier false&#xD;
front and cap. She also put on her California jewelry;&#xD;
an audacious pair of earrings, a watch and cable chain,&#xD;
with~a pencil case and half a. dozen ~y looking ornaments&#xD;
besides dangling to it, several clii ni~inger rings; and an&#xD;
enormous pin Ab full of red, blue an green stones. She&#xD;
was delighted with an opportunity of showing off these&#xD;
fine things ~s well as, the splendor of her parlors to one of&#xD;
the "upper crust."&#xD;
Mrs. Squires meantime was entertaining herself 'with a&#xD;
survey of the parlor decorations~ .She was a woman of&#xD;
correct taste, and a strong sense of the ridiculous, and&#xD;
of course could not but be highly amused at the appear-&#xD;
ance of this parvenu establishment. The huge pyramids&#xD;
of brass and glass which' glittered oti the mantel, . the&#xD;
gaudy' cornices, and other tinsel articles, she ~{otested&#xD;
&#xD;
made her eyes ache for a whole week afterwards; while&#xD;
the stiff arrangement of the furniture,, about the sides&#xD;
of the rooms, looking as if it did not feel at home. in the&#xD;
least,~ gave her a very uncomfortable feeling, and a* strong&#xD;
desire to relieve it from its uneasy position. But the&#xD;
"family picture "astonished her more than anything else.&#xD;
She had travelled aiid visited many galleries of paintings,&#xD;
but bad never seen a work of art that would in any degree&#xD;
compare with it. Her ecstasy was so great that she could&#xD;
not help indulging in a hearty laugh all by herself.&#xD;
When her amazement at the 'grandeur which surrounded&#xD;
her had in a measure subsided, the pale, pleading face&#xD;
of the little girl returned to her recollection. There was&#xD;
an expression about it that impressed her greatly, and she&#xD;
knew that there must be something in the child's present&#xD;
circumstances which had caused her singular manner when&#xD;
she spoke to her, and she regretted that she had not said&#xD;
more to her.&#xD;
The entrance of Mrs. Smith interrupted these reflec-&#xD;
tions~ She advanced towards Mrs. Squires with an air&#xD;
of perfect self-satisfaction, and much iustljng of silk.&#xD;
"I'm very glad to see you," she said; seizing Mrs.&#xD;
Squires's hand and shaking it up and down like a wood-&#xD;
chopper. "You've been so long a coming that I begun&#xD;
to think you didn't mean to call at all. Set down in the&#xD;
rocking~chair, do."&#xD;
"I thank you, my seat is very good."&#xD;
Ai~d. so Mrs. Smith dumped herself down into the rock-&#xD;
ing-chair, and immediately began to rock back and forth,&#xD;
in a manner characteristic of nervousness and vulgarity&#xD;
combined. "Won't you take off your things?" and&#xD;
"how's Mr. Squires?" exclaimed Mrs. Smith, hurriedly.&#xD;
"Mr. Squires is very well, I thank you."&#xD;
&#xD;

TRIALS AND CHANGES.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'm very glad to hear it, health is such a blessing , I&#xD;
feel to envy well folks, since I'm getting so delikit."&#xD;
"I noticed a beautiful little flower near the gate in your&#xD;
yard, Mrs.~ Smith, is it an annual?"&#xD;
" I don't know whether that's the name of it or not, I&#xD;
never troubled nTiyself to know what it was; you see my&#xD;
nurse girl had some seeds, and my little boy asked ijie to&#xD;
let her plant 'em somewhere, so I told her to stick 'em&#xD;
down there; but I aint no great hand for flowers any&#xD;
way; but my husband has a great deal of taste in the fine&#xD;
arts, and so have I, and our family picture is a satisfaction&#xD;
to us both. I sejested- the suppositions myself, and if the&#xD;
cost of a thing~ is any criturion, I am sure' it ought to be&#xD;
good, for Mr. Smith had to pay thirty dollars forit; for&#xD;
my part I don't begrudge tle money, ~e don't he; law&#xD;
what's thirty dollars to him?" )&#xD;
Thus she went on, rocking and t44king, until Mrs.&#xD;
Squires who had come in on an errand, felt impatient for&#xD;
an opportunity to say what she wished and be gone. At&#xD;
Jendth she ventured, during, a momentary pause in Mrs.&#xD;
Smith's volubility to take out a paper and pencil, hoping&#xD;
thus to attract her attention.&#xD;
!The latterhowever, was only the more gratified, as she&#xD;
*     took it for granted that Mrs~ Squires intended copying the&#xD;
*     family picture.&#xD;
"It heard you drawed beautiful and I like to have folks&#xD;
see the picture, that knows ho* to appreciate it."&#xD;
" The effect is very striking," observed Mrs. Squires,&#xD;
"and such a painting is certainly quite an addition to a&#xD;
room, but Gf course, the greatest value of a picture is t1~&#xD;
faithfulness with which it preserves the likeness of a friend."&#xD;
Yes, At's very gratifying to have a real good picture."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Time adds to the value of these little mementoes, when&#xD;
God has taken our friends forever from us," said Mrs.&#xD;
Squires, sadly as she placed her band instinctively upon a&#xD;
little miniature of her own dear mother, who had died but&#xD;
recently.&#xD;
"That's so," said, Mrs. Smith, "but 'then fashions&#xD;
change so fast, and I never could endure an old-fashioned.&#xD;
picture, I've got a painting' of my mothe~ for instance, it's&#xD;
a real pretty face, but dear me, the hair is stuck up~ so&#xD;
high on her head, and such an old-fashioned mankiller, I&#xD;
always keep it in the back chamber. If Professor Boggles&#xD;
will just put a new-fashioned cap and Barskeeh on it, I&#xD;
will hang it in the back parlor; for' they say it's all the&#xD;
fashion to have your parents' pictures in your best rooms&#xD;
now."&#xD;
Mrs Squires had always tried to show the respect of,&#xD;
civility to opinions not in harmony-with her own; but fear-&#xD;
ing that she might be tempted to violate her rule, if' the&#xD;
conversation continued, she determined to make the ob-&#xD;
ject of her call apparent and to terminate it ~as soon as&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
Making a courageous effort for this purpose she said,&#xD;
"I called, ~Mrs. Smith, 'to ask you to contribute something&#xD;
toward getting new lamps for the church. You know that&#xD;
our lamps are getting shabby, and many of them ar~&#xD;
broken."&#xD;
Mrs. Smith's countenance fell, her voice seemed sud-&#xD;
denly to lose its utterance, her heart sank within her and&#xD;
her rocking-chair which had kept time by rapid or slow&#xD;
vibration 1~o the energeticc or moderate demonstrations of&#xD;
its occupant, came to an unwanted stop. -&#xD;
"After all she haint come for a regular call only a beg.&#xD;

ging, and I've a good mind not to give her a single cent,"&#xD;
thought Mrs. Smith, "but then she'll see I haint got no&#xD;
money t9 command," and she continued aloud. "Oh,&#xD;
yes, certainly, I'm glad somebody has got public spirrit&#xD;
enough to attend t~ them lamps; it's high time somebody&#xD;
took hold, but you've happened to ketch me at an unfor..&#xD;
tinate time. You see I dismissed my dramestic this morn-&#xD;
ing, quite unexpected, and after Mr. Smith had gone to&#xD;
the store, and so I was obleeged to pay her out of my&#xD;
private purse, and it pretty near cleaned it' out, and Mr.&#xD;
Smith not being in you l~now, - I haint g~t i1~ replenished.&#xD;
But when he comes home to dinner,, I'll get a supply and&#xD;
send some round to you."&#xD;
As this speech was all a falsehood, it was no wonder&#xD;
that Mrs. Smith hesitated so~newhat in delivering it, and&#xD;
Mrs. Squires, who understood it to be such, was disgusted&#xD;
as well as amijsed. 'She, however, thanked her' for the&#xD;
promised aid, and handed her the paper, to' put down her&#xD;
'name and the -amount she would give.&#xD;
Mr8. Smith looked over the names, and noticing that&#xD;
dollars was the largest sum given b&#xD;
two                                  y any one, she&#xD;
placed that amount opposite her own name in very large&#xD;
figures and lThnded the paper back with an air of triumph.&#xD;
"I'll send it round by my nurse girl, this afternoon,'~&#xD;
she said, as if to impress upoti Mrs. Squires 'the fact that&#xD;
she kept a girl to take the care of, her child.&#xD;
"By the way, was it.your n~irse girl who came to the&#xD;
door?".&#xD;
'"She is a beautiful child, and. very y~ng, I should&#xD;
think to have the care of an infant."&#xD;
I guess there aint no dancer of her hurting herself,"&#xD;
&#xD;
said Mrs. Smith, somewhat annoyed by the lady's expres-&#xD;
sion of interest. "She's a complete little~ shirk, I only&#xD;
keep her out of charity, they are so awfully poor."&#xD;
"Whose child is she?"&#xD;
"Well her father'8 name w~as Elmer, he went to Gala-&#xD;
forny and died there and kft his family dreadful destitute."&#xD;
"Indeed,~' said Mrs.. Squires "then she is Susan&#xD;
Grant's child. I had no idea they were so reduced.&#xD;
Susan was a very good girj."&#xD;
"But poQr and proud, too proud to let her sittiwation&#xD;
be known, but I happened to 'find it out almost by acci-&#xD;
dent, and so I took this young one off her hands; but I&#xD;
don't know whether I can ever make anything of her or&#xD;
not, -can't trust her a minnit when I aint by to watch her,&#xD;
she spends half her time a looking' out the winder when the&#xD;
babe's asleep, inside of sticking to. her sewing."&#xD;
Mrs., Squires made no reply, but soon took her leave&#xD;
with a feeling of sorrow for the poor little child, which&#xD;
Mrs. Smith's unkind words had failed to diminish, and as&#xD;
she continued her'. labors, the pale, sad face of the little&#xD;
girl arose often.to her recollection, and she determined to&#xD;
do what she could to rescue her from a position which she&#xD;
felt must be full of misery.&#xD;

MARY ELMER, QR&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
N the sinking ~f hopes and the rising of fears, which&#xD;
the progress of Mrs. Squires' call had developed,&#xD;
1~Irs. Smith's amiability had in no way increased,&#xD;
and as Mrs. Squires had not even invited her to&#xD;
"return the 'call" as she bade her a coldly polite good&#xD;
afternoon, Mrs. Smith said to herself "I am almost sorry&#xD;
1 ,signed the paper at all, but it's t~o late now."&#xD;
'The baby had awaked during the call, and little' Mary's&#xD;
bands being now literally "full," Mrs. Smith was com-~&#xD;
pelled to prepare dinner alone, but she had only succeeded&#xD;
in~ replacing her finery in the clothes press when Mr. ~naith&#xD;
and the children came in, and the disorder and confusion&#xD;
became m7ore intolerable than ever.&#xD;
At length dinner was placed on the table, and when the.&#xD;
more clamorous demands of the children were silenced as&#xD;
Emith said by "letting their victuals stop their mouths,"&#xD;
the subject of'Mrs. Squires' call was mentioned.&#xD;
"I think it's high time some of them sort, of folks begun&#xD;
to take a little notice of us; we have paid a' big house rent&#xD;
about long enough for nothing."&#xD;
"Isha'n't be in. any hurry to return the call. I guess&#xD;
Pm as goiA as anybody."&#xD;
"Hadn't better be too particular; it's to my interest to&#xD;
get in with them sort of folks.".&#xD;
"'Yes, and be dunned for a ~ubscription every day of&#xD;

&#xD;
your life4 That's one thing she wanted this very day; all&#xD;
the upper crust are signing round to get new lamps for the&#xD;
meeting-house, and so she wanted to see how much she&#xD;
could get away from us. But she's a polite beggar I must&#xD;
say, for she didn't come right out on the start; but it's all.&#xD;
the same if they only get the money."&#xD;
"That's so, and it's very obliging to offer to spend&#xD;
your money for you, but I hope you let her see you could&#xD;
give as much as any of 'em; folks can't be popular withQut&#xD;
its costing anything. I often see men signing ever so&#xD;
much for foreign missions and such like things, when I&#xD;
know they are distressed to death with their grocery bills;&#xD;
but here's the money, and you had heifer send Mary right&#xD;
over with it. You see it won't be any less for waiting, and&#xD;
then it will show her that we are prompt and on hand&#xD;
about the matter."&#xD;
"Don't be in such a desperate hurry; I guess Mary&#xD;
can wash up the dishes before she goes.~~&#xD;
The meal was finished; Mary went about her task,&#xD;
baby was unusually quiet and amiable, amusing himself&#xD;
with s6me green apples which had rolled on the floor from&#xD;
Ferdinand's pocket, and which he stoutly maintained a&#xD;
schoolboy had given him, while his mother as firmly de-&#xD;
clared, that they came of, her "don't-seek-no-farther tree&#xD;
and she knew they did."&#xD;
Mary applied herself to her task with renewed energy.&#xD;
There was a calmness and determination in her manner&#xD;
in which one of greater penetration than Mrs. Smith might&#xD;
have read a sense of despotism and a disposition to resist-&#xD;
ance, for she had felt the spirit of insurrection rising in her&#xD;
heart, which already beat with accelerated pulse at the&#xD;
thought of escape from thraldom.&#xD;
21*&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8269-00000127"/>&#xD;
But Mrs. Smith only congratulated herself that Mary&#xD;
knew she had got the work to do, and as she had told her&#xD;
"the quicker it was done the bettr," she innocently&#xD;
thought Mary was fulfilling her own instructions. Very&#xD;
different, however, were the thoughts which occupied the&#xD;
mind of our little heroine. '~ If is not right for Mrs.&#xD;
Smith to treat me so, and if mamma knew about it she&#xD;
would not have me stay here another day. It will not be&#xD;
disobeying her if I go home," and the child was glad that&#xD;
the errand to Mrs. Squires gave her an opportunity of get-&#xD;
ting started on her way, and when, after her bonnet and&#xD;
shawl were on and she ready for a start, Mrs. Smith said,&#xD;
"Now take that money and go straight to Squareses,&#xD;
and then come straight home, and don't let the grass grow&#xD;
under your feet ," Mary answered, with a calmness which&#xD;
quite surprised her mistress,&#xD;
"I shall go and see my mother first." Mrs. Smith&#xD;
would have forbidden this rebellious act but she remem-&#xD;
bered that the very day before a little boy.had brought an&#xD;
u~gent6request that Mary might be allowed to come home&#xD;
to see her grandmother.&#xD;
Amid the contending thoughts whi~h had occupied Mrs..&#xD;
Smith's mind she had quite forgotten the x~equest, and now&#xD;
when it arose to her recollection, instead of sending any&#xD;
apology 'to Mrs. Elmer, she only said,&#xD;
.' Well, go along, gad-about, you will be a small loss&#xD;
here; after you have got starved out, maybe you will un-&#xD;
derstand what I am trying to do for you; but miii dyou&#xD;
leave the money to Squareses, and just tell her I sent it,&#xD;
and don't ~make a little tattler of' yourself, for tattling is&#xD;
awful mean, do ye hear?"&#xD;
Mary was soon started on her journey.. She was met&#xD;
&#xD;
at Mrs. Squires' door by that lady, who was now ready to&#xD;
resume her. morning's labors. She asked 'the child pleas-&#xD;
antly to come in, but Mary was too anxious to reach her&#xD;
own home to stop long on the way, although the tidy sit~&#xD;
Pug-room looked very inviting. A great many questions&#xD;
suggested themselves to the lady's mind, but she deter-&#xD;
mined not to direct the child's attentiQn to ~the unpleasant-&#xD;
ness of her present condition, until she could decide' on&#xD;
some w~y of improving it.&#xD;
On learning that Mary was on her way honie, Mrs.&#xD;
Squires prepared a little basket of cakes and fruit for the&#xD;
family, and as she walked along with her, learned what she&#xD;
could of them, and asked her to call again at her house.&#xD;
"0 yes, ma'amjY~ill come and bring back the basket."&#xD;
This was just what Mrs. Sqt~ires wanted, although she&#xD;
had not mentioned that the basket was not included iii the&#xD;
little gift, but the child's bringing it back would, die hoped,&#xD;
give her further opportunity of learning the needs of her&#xD;
old acquaintance, and of 'furnishing to her assistance in an&#xD;
u~iobtrusive and&#xD;
dined         acceptable manner. She felt greatly in-&#xD;
t~o, go home with the child that very day, but Mrs.&#xD;
Squires was not in the habit of acting upon new inipulses,&#xD;
and her time had already' been appropriated to th6 church&#xD;
business; therefore on bidding the, little girl good-by, she&#xD;
gave her maiden name for her. mother with messages. of'&#xD;
kind regard, and a promise' to call very soon to see her.&#xD;
The remembrance of Mrs. Squires' kindness made the*&#xD;
child continue her walk with a quicker step and a lighter&#xD;

[I&#xD;
&#xD;
But as she reached her home she was greatly surprised,&#xD;
and wondered what was going on. A bedstead was 'lean-&#xD;
'ing against the end of the house, while quilts and pillows&#xD;
were airing upon a clothes-line. A boy was holding&#xD;
some horses near the gate,~ while two or three grave-look-&#xD;
ing men were engaged in a quiet consultation near the&#xD;
door. She had begun to fear that mamma h~d got to&#xD;
move again, but felt reassured when David Gray spoke&#xD;
kindly to her, and before she had fairly reached the door,&#xD;
Johunie came running out, saying, "Why did not you&#xD;
come last night, M~iry, when' we sent for you? grand z~ia&#xD;
was almost gone then, and we all wished you was here."&#xD;
As Mary passed into the house, there was not &amp;amp;ne famil-&#xD;
iar face to greet her. A coffin, covered, with a black pall&#xD;
rested upon' the table in the front corner of the room.&#xD;
~ small bouquet of violets stood on the stand in an old-&#xD;
f~ishioned wine-glass, while two grave-looking women&#xD;
were engaged on a mourning dress. The 'little gid paused&#xD;
a few moments to gaze in silent reverence on that v~nera-&#xD;
ble fa~e 'which, though the animation of life had forever&#xD;
fled,' yet seemed already ~touched with that triumphant&#xD;
brightness which betok~ns the dawn of immortality, she&#xD;
pressed her lips silently to that aged brow, and tli~n as&#xD;
quietly passed up ' stairs t her mother's room. Mrs.&#xD;
Ekuer was seated in her accustomed sewing-chair beside&#xD;
the little table, with her child in her arms, and although&#xD;
be had been asleep some time she~ did not lay him down,&#xD;
but pressed him more closely to her heart as she thought&#xD;
how few were left to claim her love or demand her care.&#xD;
The little fellow, quite unconscious of the sorrow which&#xD;
had deprived him of his usual lullaby, had asked for the&#xD;
"shining star," but his mamma could not sing it for him&#xD;
&#xD;
to-night, indeed she could scarcely see beyond the cloud&#xD;
of desolation and sorrow which oppressed her; yet she&#xD;
did not despair, for in the many trials of her faith, which&#xD;
had led her pathway through thorns and sorrows, she still&#xD;
cherished that "hope" which is "the companion given&#xD;
the unfortt~uate by pitying Heayen," and her trusting heart&#xD;
always found some object for gratitude or praise. And'&#xD;
even now, she was grateful that she had been able to&#xD;
make her mother's last days comfortable ; and that as her&#xD;
willing spirit had bent affectionately to her filial task, it&#xD;
had not been hindered by the' iveakness of the flesh.&#xD;
She wondered if she could have done anythii~g more for&#xD;
her mother during the long, weary illness, and then she&#xD;
looked hopefully to that blessed place of rest, where trials&#xD;
and changes con~e no more.&#xD;
Mrs. Elmer clasped her daughter's hand with a faint&#xD;
smile of welcome, and held it long in silence; and though&#xD;
few words were spoken, each felt how strong was the bond&#xD;
of affection and 'sympathy which united them.&#xD;
Little Johnnie soon came bringing up the little basket&#xD;
of apples.&#xD;
Aint these real beauties?" said he, as he selected the&#xD;
fairest for his mother. "And just see what lots 'of'&#xD;
cakes."&#xD;
"Put them on a plate, Johunie, and offer some to the&#xD;
ladies down stairs," said Mips. Elmer.&#xD;
Johnnie hastened to obey the instructions, and soon re-&#xD;
turned saying, "Oh, there's the funniest-looking gi~i&#xD;
down-stairs, and she wants to see yiu, to tell you about&#xD;
Mary, she said."&#xD;
"I think it's Jerusha," said Mary, starting quickly to&#xD;
meet her faithful friend.&#xD;

MARY ELMER, 01?&#xD;
&#xD;
Whatever might have been the enthusiasm of the meet-&#xD;
ing between the two girls, out of that house of bondage,&#xD;
in. other circumstances, there was i~ne now.&#xD;
"I'm so glad you got 'away £ro~ there," said Jerusha.&#xD;
"You see I did not know you ha~ come, and so I thought&#xD;
I would stop and tell your mother about matters and&#xD;
things. I've been to Mrs. Lee's, and the colored man&#xD;
says she is expected ' home to-night, but I must hurry&#xD;
along, for I have ,hired 'to the Eagle Tavern for a fort-&#xD;
night; so good-by, Mary," and the 'poor homeless crea-&#xD;
ture started back to fulfil the duties of her new engage-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Mrs. Maddock,' who had been very much occupied in&#xD;
assisting to prepare Mrs. Grant for her last repose, had&#xD;
gone to her own rooms to discharge the domestic&#xD;
duties of her household; but as soon as she learned that&#xD;
~Mary had come, she came in with Martha and Ann, to&#xD;
welcome her home again.&#xD;
The funeral was 'appointed for the next afternoon, and&#xD;
passed. off so quietly, that many living very near, and in&#xD;
The same street, had. not even heard of a death in the&#xD;
neighborhood. Mrs. Lee had not been able to reach her&#xD;
home as soon as she had anticipated, and arrived 'only at&#xD;
the hour appointed for the funeral.&#xD;
Mrs. Squires had heard of it through the clergyman,&#xD;
of whom she 'had made inquiries after the family, and had&#xD;
taken some pains to inform those whom she thought might&#xD;
remember Susan Grant'and her mother in better days.&#xD;
Still. it was only a small, quiet, funeral. Mrs. Lee had&#xD;
kindly sent her carriage and some' money for the sexton's&#xD;
fee; although too much overcome by her journey and&#xD;
grief at the loss of her only sister, to leave her own room.&#xD;
&#xD;
David Grey had engaged the hearse and the bearers, and&#xD;
his own wagon with the carriages of Mrs. Lee and Mrs.&#xD;
Squires, formed the little procession. Yet in her heart,&#xD;
Susan Elmer was thankful to give her mother so respect-~&#xD;
able a burial; and when the poor old woman had been so&#xD;
feeble, and helpless, and troublesome, that some had said,&#xD;
"It was strange God's providence did not remove her,"&#xD;
the devoted daughter had toiled, and waited, and prayed,&#xD;
that her mother's life might be spared until something&#xD;
should occur to enable her to show her mother the respect&#xD;
of a proper sepulture; and her trials ~iad never yet founa&#xD;
the limit of her faith and patience; for even when the&#xD;
aged mother's words had become almost* inarticulate, their&#xD;
last 'utterances were of ho~pe and encouragement, and she&#xD;
had even tried to join in the chorus of the shining star,&#xD;
when her faculties showed many sad symptoms of decay-&#xD;
jflo' nature.&#xD;
0&#xD;
When the few who had come to attend the funeral had&#xD;
again dispersed, and the little family were once more&#xD;
alone, Susan's mind wandered to the little ba~nd in Para-&#xD;
dise. That beautiful portion of Psalms, which t~he Rev.&#xD;
Mr. Bingham had chosen as the text for his hopeful dis-:&#xD;
course on the resurrection of the just, came again and&#xD;
again to her mind, with new significance, as she repeated,&#xD;
",My heart* and my flesh faileth,, but, God is .the strength&#xD;
of my heart, and my portion forever." And as she re-&#xD;
membered how her mother had by faith and prayer, and&#xD;
Works of charity and love, made God her portion on&#xD;
earth, she trusted that he would now strengthen and re-&#xD;
store the weak spirit, so long bowed by the infirmities of~&#xD;
the flesh. Then~ she thought of her dear father, who had&#xD;

TRIALS AND CHANGES.&#xD;
&#xD;
long ago passed from the earth, and how blest and happy&#xD;
* they would be to be separated no more forever.&#xD;
And in the midst of her loneliness and sorrow came a&#xD;
gleam of joy, that those who are limited on earth, in that&#xD;
holy bond which God has blest, can be sejj~rated only by&#xD;
Death, and that even his power is but temporary.&#xD;
Then. she tried to think George would be there, but her&#xD;
thoughts of him were so much associated with their last&#xD;
parting, when he had declared that he should be back&#xD;
again all right in a year or so, that she involuntarily ex-&#xD;
claimed, "What if George should come back just as he&#xD;
said, alive and well., and rich!"&#xD;
She had never set her heart upon riches, even when her&#xD;
husband's prospects for success had seeiiaed fairest, and&#xD;
she had watched with solicitude his disappointment and de-&#xD;
pression at the failure of his cherished plans, while her&#xD;
heart turned more and more to the treasures which are&#xD;
incorruptible and fade not away. She had often made&#xD;
the humble prayer of Agar her owi~, and though pov~&#xD;
erty a~d sickness had been suffered to remain very near&#xD;
her, she had never, denied her Lord or been tempted to&#xD;
~steal, and take the name of her God in vain.&#xD;
The children nestled more closely beside their mother,&#xD;
as the shades of evening closed around; and as the little.&#xD;
group united in the supplicating petitions of, "Our&#xD;
Father who art in heaven," Susan's heart found a new&#xD;
cause for gratitude, that little Mary's voice again mingled&#xD;
with the rest. The little ones were soon lost in the calm&#xD;
sleep of infancy; but Susan Elmer was unusually wakeful&#xD;
that night, and her mind still turned to those she had&#xD;
Joved and lost; i~nd remembering how her mother had en-&#xD;
&#xD;
courage Mary's prayers for her father, even when Smith&#xD;
had declared him to be dead, her last waking thoughts&#xD;
were a prayer " that God would be with and protect them&#xD;
till the great day of his final coming."&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;

HE cares, the faticrues&#xD;
'few weeks, had ~ ~ and anxieties of the last&#xD;
worn upon Mrs. Elmer more&#xD;
~'I' than she had been aware of, and she~slept much&#xD;
~ later than usual the next niorning~ and when she&#xD;
arose and tried to discharge er household duties, a&#xD;
strange and ill-defined presence seemed to linger about&#xD;
her. A something which she could neither throw off nor&#xD;
account for, and when in the afternoon Mrs. Maddock.&#xD;
came in with her sewing to beguile the loneliness, she yen-&#xD;
tured to tell her of a strange dream which had often vis-&#xD;
ited her pillow. She had spoken of it once, she said, to&#xD;
her mother, but as neither of them Were superstitious be-.&#xD;
lievers in signs and omens, the subject had soon been&#xD;
dismissed from their conversation; but now as it had again&#xD;
returned to her, she confessed she could not whoiJy dispel&#xD;
its influence from her mind, nor could. sh~ wantonly stifle&#xD;
the faint hope born of that dream, even though it pos..&#xD;
messed no apparent foundation in probability; and she felt&#xD;
inclined to relate to Mrs. Maddock, "That she had ~&#xD;
many times dreamed of seeing her husband, 'always in a&#xD;

&#xD;

* strange place, and sometimes sick and in bed, and some-&#xD;
time8 engaged in one or another of the occupations which&#xD;
he had followed before leaving home; and that on every&#xD;
occasion he had failed recognize her, or only spoken&#xD;
with the indifference of a. stranger."&#xD;
"That dream is as plain as day to me," replied Mrs.&#xD;
Maddocl~, "you may mark my word for it, George Elmer is&#xD;
not dead. I don't, believe in witcheries ~nd superstitions,&#xD;
my mother did not before me; but my mother believed in&#xD;
some dreams, and so do I. Don't you remember Scripture&#xD;
tells us that Daniel had understanding in all visions and&#xD;
dreams? and don't you know how Joseph interpreted&#xD;
Pharaoh's dreams?&#xD;
~' If you had dreamed of seeing him here, I should say&#xD;
it was only natural, and could be accounted for on the&#xD;
ground of your thinking about him so much; but your&#xD;
* dreaming that way so many times, of seeing him in a&#xD;
strange place, makes me think he aint dead.&#xD;
"But, Susan, what proof did you ever have that he was&#xD;
dead?' who told you he was?"&#xD;
anj&#xD;
"I never heard anything about it from one but&#xD;
binith," replied Susan.&#xD;
"What; Jonathan Smith the shoemaker!" exclaimed&#xD;
Mrs. Maddock in evident astonishment, "I don't mean to&#xD;
say ~that it necessarily ruins a man's veracity to make shoes&#xD;
for a living,' but mercy on us 'I I should sooner think of&#xD;
believing a dream, than of taking his word' any dine. I&#xD;
should not be a bit surprised if you heard from George&#xD;
right off&#xD;
"My Uncle William Barber went to the Patriot war,&#xD;
and was gone for years and'years, everybody gave him up&#xD;
for dead; but Aunt Lavina always said, he would come&#xD;

back, she knew it just by a dream; and sure ~enough he&#xD;
did come back, after serving ten years at Van Dieman's&#xD;
Land. Every body was as much astonished as if one had&#xD;
arose from the dead, except Aunt 'Lavina; she went round&#xD;
smiling and smoothing out her cap-strings and saying, 'I&#xD;
told you so!' I don't want to raise any expectations that,&#xD;
aint to be realized, but you may 'depend upon it~ George&#xD;
Elmer is alive."&#xD;
Martha and Ann Maddock came in during the evening,&#xD;
and each expressed satisfaction and pleasure that Mary was&#xD;
safe home again. "I hope you will never have her go&#xD;
back again," said Martha, "if I had known how shabbily&#xD;
she was treated, I'm sure I would have gone after her my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"I should be very glad, to keep the children together,"&#xD;
replied Mrs. Elmer, "but everything is so dear in the&#xD;
market, and we have not any garden you know."&#xD;
"But," continued Martha, "it won't take a single hod&#xD;
more of coal if she stays at home, Than 'if she goes, and as&#xD;
for vegetables, we always get our winter supply of Uncle&#xD;
James; and I know mother will engage some from him for&#xD;
you. We do all the sewing for him and the boys, and of&#xD;
course it don't come so high as if they went to the shop&#xD;
with their work, and then they bring us good measure of&#xD;
apples and vegetables."&#xD;
.It was all satisfactorily arranged. Ann suggested that&#xD;
Mary could sometimes go, down to 'the village 'foi thread&#xD;
and needles for them, besides holding the skeins of silk,&#xD;
and both The girls felt a gratification in trying to make&#xD;
amends for their former hastiness to the child.&#xD;

&#xD;
seemed about to be realized, Susan applied herself to her&#xD;
dail5r' tasks with renewed energy; and as Mrs. Maddock&#xD;
and her daughters; by their continued kindness, did all they&#xD;
could to diminish Mrs. Elmer's sense of obligation, a feel~&#xD;
'ing of cheerful contentment, almost akin to happiness, once&#xD;
more stole over her.&#xD;
True their daily needs required her constant labor; their&#xD;
clothing was of the plainest material, and their table offered&#xD;
no11e~ of those delicacies which are counted by so many as&#xD;
necessaries. There were few to sympathize with her lone..&#xD;
lines, and she might have been. less happy had not neces-&#xD;
sity compelled her to be always caring for the comfort of&#xD;
those dependent upon her.&#xD;
It had been many rx~onths since Susan had thought of&#xD;
rest or recreation; but one bright Saturday afternoon in&#xD;
October, her work for the week being completed, Susan&#xD;
proposed to the children a walk to the village graveyard,&#xD;
and' a visit to grand ma's grave.&#xD;
The little on~s were gi~eatly delighted with the plan, and&#xD;
Were soon ready for a start. Georgie was carefully tucked&#xD;
up in Mrs. Maddock's little wagon, and Johnnie and Mary&#xD;
volunteered to draw him all the way, but they began to&#xD;
show signs of weariness before ~reaching the top of the hill&#xD;
where {he burial ground ~was situated, and as their mamma&#xD;
relieved them from the task, they soon began amusing&#xD;
themselves by gathering the ~bright autumn leaves now&#xD;
gently falling upon the shaded pathway.&#xD;
As the little party stopped to rest before climbing the&#xD;
rustic stile, Mary wove the leaves into bright wreaths, after.&#xD;
patterns which Jerusha had taught her, while their iYiother&#xD;
smiled approvingly at their quiet. enjoyment, ~as Mary&#xD;
placed one of the wreaths. on little Georgie's head.&#xD;
&#xD;
They soon entered the yard; and the children were&#xD;
silenced by that' feeling of awe and reverence for the dead&#xD;
which nature has implanted in the heart of childhood, and&#xD;
which seems to survive only in proportion as its innocence&#xD;
is preserved.&#xD;
Mary walked beside her mother, while Johnnie went&#xD;
before them , gazing in silence at the bright autumn flowers,*&#xD;
or the tall monuments, on which his eye rested until they&#xD;
paused beside thq new"made grave, where Johunie was&#xD;
first to speak, as he asked "if grandma knew they had&#xD;
come to visit her?" While Mrs. Elmer was trying to&#xD;
think of some answer to the question, Mary 8aid quickly, -&#xD;
"Maybe her spirit knows it up in heaven, if her body&#xD;
don't know it here. Keep still, Johnnie I"&#xD;
As Susan Elmer stood beside the grave of her mother, she&#xD;
wished that she might place upon it some memorial worthy&#xD;
a spot nLade sacred by her last repose. Then, recollecting&#xD;
the little bright~eyed violets which grew in Mrs. Maddock's&#xD;
yard, and her mother's fondness for them, she resolved to&#xD;
cover the mound with these humble flowers. There seemed&#xD;
to ~be an appropriateness in placing there those 'humble&#xD;
wayside blossoms which survive so many of Spring's earlier&#xD;
flowers, and Susan dwelt with 'pleasure on her little plan.&#xD;
As they were preparing to leave the ground, Mary'&#xD;
stopped to repair the little wreath, which had come apart&#xD;
with Georgie's rough handling, and 'placed it upon the&#xD;
grave.&#xD;
"I'm afraid' the wind will blow it ~off," eaid Johnnie, and&#xD;
he stepped back toward the stile where he had noticed&#xD;
some short pieces of painted slats lying on the grass beside&#xD;
~a new inclosure. .&#xD;

MARY ELMER, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
"Will any ~ne care if I take these?" he said, handing&#xD;
them to his mother.&#xD;
"I think not* my dear," she answered, and placing the&#xD;
two pieces in the form of a cross, she laid them upon the&#xD;
little wreath~&#xD;
The effect of that bright golden wreath lying upon the&#xD;
rich, deep green grass and surmounted by the little white&#xD;
cross, was very beautiful; to a practiced artist it might&#xD;
have suggested the illuminated j/aintings of the early&#xD;
masters, but Susan's natural taste for beautiful things had&#xD;
never been heightened by artistic cultivation, and as she&#xD;
looked admiringly upon it, her greatest pleasure was that&#xD;
she could leave some token of remembrance upon the&#xD;
grave of' her earliest and most valued frk~nd.&#xD;
While they werg passing out ~f the yard, Mary and&#xD;
Johnnie exclaimed together, "Aint that pretty?" pointing&#xD;
toward a bright little bed of' immortelles, bordered with&#xD;
pansies. Mrs. Elmer read the plain inscription and was&#xD;
pleased to find there the name and age of Dr. Lee, with&#xD;
the simple V~rsc,&#xD;
&#xD;
"He is not here; but precious is the dust&#xD;
Which once enshrined the object of our love;&#xD;
He is not here, but fondly do we trust&#xD;
To meet hin~ in a brighter world above."&#xD;
&#xD;
There was something about that little, gray Italian shaft&#xD;
and those unpretending flowers which would have pleased&#xD;
Mrs. Elmer, ha4 she known nothing of her whose taste&#xD;
had marked the spot or of him whose memory was hero so&#xD;
tenderly cherished; and Si;isan thought while looking at&#xD;
these memoi*ls, of the many~ kindnesses of her friend and&#xD;
felt a degree of self-reproach that she had never been to&#xD;

&#xD;
call upon Mrs. Lee since that lady's return from the East.&#xD;
True the time had been more than occupied with care and&#xD;
labor, but there was also another reason, which she&#xD;
scarcely recognized as such, and it was th~tt feeling of hesi-&#xD;
tation which any person of true refinement has at the&#xD;
thought of calling as a friend upon one whose worldly&#xD;
position is so much above her own as was that of Mrs.&#xD;
Lee and toward whom she could but feel an embarrassing&#xD;
sense of obligation.&#xD;
Then, conscious that the neglect might have the appear-&#xD;
ance of indifference or ingratitude, she resolved to seek an&#xD;
early opportunity to express in person the grateful regard&#xD;
which she had heretofore sent by Peter Jackson.&#xD;
Presently Johnnie discovered a carriage driving into the&#xD;
yard, and Mary soon espied the ebony face of' Peter Jack-&#xD;
son, who was already showing his teeth in answer to her&#xD;
signs of recognition. And, strange to say, there was&#xD;
Jerusha, too,, sitting beside Mrs. Lee in the carriage, as if&#xD;
to support her, for this was Mrs. Lee's first ride since her&#xD;
illness.&#xD;
They came directly to the little inclosure, and Jerusha&#xD;
assisted Mrs. Lee to alight from the carriage, when the&#xD;
letter approached Mrs. Elmer~and by a gentle pressure of&#xD;
the hand, and a quiet smile of welcome, expressed the&#xD;
pleasure which the unlooked-for meeting gave her.&#xD;
JerusI~ia and Mary were more demonstrative in their&#xD;
recognition, and Mrs Lee declared the ride had benefited&#xD;
her so much she would remain there while Peter and&#xD;
Jerusha took the children a little drive aroun&amp;amp;the ground.&#xD;
The carriage soon, roiled away, ~nd Mrs. Lee invited Susan&#xD;
to a seat beside her in the little yard, and as tftcy eat there&#xD;
alone with the dead, each felt bound to the other by the&#xD;

&#xD;
tender ties, of friendship and ~y'~mpathy as well as the&#xD;
strong bond of benevolence find gratitude.&#xD;
Mrs. Elmer: ~soon spoke ~o Mrs. tee of Jolinnie's hard&#xD;
question and Mary's ready answer and asked what she&#xD;
thought about the subject.&#xD;
"I'm afraid we~shall never 1~ave much definite knowl-&#xD;
edge 'about it;"' said Mrs. Lee, "it is a subject on which&#xD;
I often talked with Dr. Lee, and I recollect he once said,&#xD;
there seemed nothing unconnected with revelation which&#xD;
was so little known: and yet so generally believed. We&#xD;
are told that the Druids, before Christianity was introduced&#xD;
into Britain, believed' that the beatified soul retained the&#xD;
love of its country and its kind, and sometimes returned&#xD;
~o the earth to assist the brethren by teaching them&#xD;
heavenly things, and~ to oppose the power of' the E~Wl One.&#xD;
In later times many- theologians have maintained that it&#xD;
is this mino'lino'of the pi~ayers and praises of the departed&#xD;
with those of the living which forms 'the communion of&#xD;
the Saints,' one article of the' Apostles' Creed.&#xD;
Ji{:our ~wn times, among the number of     called&#xD;
spiritualists, a favorite ~theory is, that the souls of the de-&#xD;
parted are very near find not only take an interest in the&#xD;
fortunes of their friends on earth, but are anxious to find&#xD;
means of communicating that interest. While some~ of&#xD;
a still less cultivated class' believe in ghosts and super..&#xD;
natural apparitions."&#xD;
"But, Mrs. Lee, will you please give me your own ideas&#xD;
about it, if you will not think, me rude. What do you&#xD;
think about it?"&#xD;
Mrs.. Lee~'was never anxious to e~pres~ her own ideas,&#xD;
but she now~ ventured to say that to her it seemed, "that&#xD;

Peter Jackson had now returned with Jerusha and the&#xD;
children, and at Mrs. Lee's request Mary was permitted to&#xD;
return home with her, while Master Johunie, with an in-&#xD;
creased sense of importance, assisted his mother in drawing&#xD;
Georgie home.&#xD;
Little Mary could scarce express the delight she felt in&#xD;
being once more in the well-remembered places, and after&#xD;
looking about the house awhile she said, "There's that&#xD;
dear little chair just where it was before, and there is that&#xD;
pretty picture, but where is Harriet?"&#xD;
"Harriet is married, and she does not live here any&#xD;
more," replied Mrs. Lee.&#xD;
"But where does she live now?" asked Mary.&#xD;
"In the country near her friends," said Mrs. Lee.&#xD;
"Well I'm glad I knew where she is. Mamma and I&#xD;
have often wondered what had become of Harriet, no one&#xD;
told us anything about her, and we thought that she had&#xD;
gonewith you."&#xD;

"Have you never seen Harriet since I went away?" said&#xD;
Mrs. Lee, with evident surprise as she recollected the&#xD;
unheard4'roui n6te entrusted to Harriet's care.&#xD;
"Noma'am, we never saw her after you went away,&#xD;
and we did not know where you were gone in a long time,&#xD;
then Peter Jackson told us, and we were very sorry your&#xD;
sister was so sick, and we missed you a great deal all the&#xD;
time."&#xD;
The child had scarcely done speaking when Mrs. Lee&#xD;
turned again to Harriet's letter, in which sh~ bad sa~id, "iI~&#xD;
forwarded your note to Mrs. Elmer, before I left town,&#xD;
and I presrnn.e you have heard from it before this time.""&#xD;
Mrs. Lee's first thought was to write for further explanation,&#xD;
for she had many times wondered at the strange silence;&#xD;
then rememberind Harriet's subsequent intention~ of visit~&#xD;
ing~ her soon, she determined t~ wait Harriet's intended&#xD;
'~ visit, for the desired information. And as she did not&#xD;
knoW Harriet's present address, this seemed the only way&#xD;
practicable.&#xD;
Just before little Mary started for home, Mrs. -Lee told&#xD;
her of a' little school which had recently opened near her&#xD;
house; and instructed the child to ask her mother's permis-&#xD;
sion to attend it,~ kindly inviting' her to come there every&#xD;
* day for dinner, and carefully informing her that she would&#xD;
provide for the tuition and the necessary books; and the&#xD;
little girl returned home full of enthusiasm over thee plan.&#xD;
The"brightness of that October day, the enjoyment of the&#xD;
children, and the unexpected pleasure of Mrs. Lee's visit,&#xD;
had . seemed to inspire Susan with new life, to which the&#xD;
thought of sending the little girl to school,, brought addi-.&#xD;
tional pleasure. She had often wished that Mary might&#xD;
have. suc~h advantages, but circumstances had heretofore&#xD;
&#xD;
~" seemed to forbid, and she therefore set' about m':iking plans&#xD;
for the improvement of the child's wardrobe, which had&#xD;
been in no way improved by her stay at the Smiths.&#xD;
Her motherly affection was stimulated perhaps, by wom-&#xD;
anly ambition, and long after the little ones were asleep&#xD;
she grew more and more wakeful in planning for the new&#xD;
enterprise, and she resolved to rise an hour earlier every&#xD;
morning, for the purpose of Preparing Mary for school.&#xD;
But on awaking the next morning, she felt a dull, uncom-&#xD;
fortable sensation in the head, her arms ached so that she&#xD;
could scarcely use them at all, and she was compelled to&#xD;
return to her bed as soon as -the morning meal was finished.&#xD;
Mary succeeded in putting the room in order, and brought&#xD;
into practice all her little s-kill in nursing her mother; but.&#xD;
spite of her efforts Susan Elmer gtew rapidly worse, and&#xD;
the child went to call Mrs. Maddock's assistance.&#xD;
The good woman soon answered the summons, and, was&#xD;
grieved an~l surprised to find 'Susan suffering from a vio-&#xD;
lent attack of fever. After bathing Susan's head and&#xD;
applying such simple remedies as were at hand, Mrs. Mad-&#xD;
dock said, "I'm sure when I come to Think of it, I aint&#xD;
a bit surprised, in fact I've expected to see you break&#xD;
down every day. No live woman could endure. it to be&#xD;
shut up as y-oii have been so long;and working early and&#xD;
late, it's a wonder you~ did not have to give up b~fore.&#xD;
You need rest and good nursing up, butyou must not&#xD;
expect to be well in a day."&#xD;
" Will my ma 'ever 'get well again?" interposed Mary,&#xD;
timidly; for she had been frightened, before calling Mrs.&#xD;
Maddock, whose energetic manner did not tend to dimin~.&#xD;
ish her alarm.&#xD;
"0 yes, I hope so, but we must take good care of her; ".&#xD;

and turning again to susan, she said, ~' ]I'dgo for a doe-&#xD;
tor~right off, but the doctors kill more than they cure, and&#xD;
y~u haven't ai~y money to waste on them."&#xD;
Mrs. Maddock again y~Aunteered her own services, and&#xD;
Susan thanked her cordially, when Mrs Maddock returned&#xD;
to her own room.&#xD;
In the midst of her own pain Su~an noticed the expres-&#xD;
sion of sorrow and anxiety upon her - child's face, and she&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Don't be frightened, my dear; I hope I shall~ feel bet-&#xD;
ter again when tbe fever* goes 6ff: and remember, Mary,&#xD;
whatever happens, it will only xrake everything worse to&#xD;
be sad~ and discouraged."&#xD;
Then the chjld tried harder to summon her courage, and&#xD;
to put~ in practice those lessons of faith and .patience of&#xD;
which her mother's life had been a constant lesson, both&#xD;
t          in example and in precept. It was ~well fo~ the child that&#xD;
she had learned the lesson thus early.&#xD;
Mrs. Mj~ddock's fears were realize2l sooner than Mrs.&#xD;
Elmer's hopes, for Susan suffered long without any signs&#xD;
of improvement. ~Now that their only means of subsistence&#xD;
were cut off by the mother's illness, the little nurse's task&#xD;
V          seemed weary and almost hopeless.&#xD;
When Martha and. Ann Maddock first keard of Mrs.&#xD;
Elmer's sickness they expressed a degree of sympathy and&#xD;
interest in the poor wornax~s misfortune quite consistent&#xD;
with their late friendly e~nauct toward her; but after a&#xD;
few days they~began to express a degree of surprise that&#xD;
no one came to ~assist in~ thee care of her; and a slight im-&#xD;
patience manifested itself in the oft-repeated wonder why&#xD;
non:e of the church members came near; for they were not&#xD;

now suffering not only the pains of illness, but for the want-&#xD;
of those necbssaries which that sickness had ren4em~d he~&#xD;
'unable to ~rocuie. She s9nt to Mrs. Elmer m~x~iy. expres-&#xD;

over \With Peter ~Jackson to carry to her friends the ixi~re&#xD;
substantial tokens of her r~gard.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
ITH th~ return of the cool autumn evenings there&#xD;
~    came back 1o our busy town many who had been&#xD;
seeking for health or recreation at the various~&#xD;
watering-places. The spirit of locomotion which&#xD;
had led so many from howe, now seemed to keep ~hem&#xD;
active, and / every local enterprise revived into a new&#xD;
life. The churches were better filled on the' Sabbath, and&#xD;
many a stylish outfit which had lost its first lustre at "The&#xD;
Springs," now aroused bitter heart-burnings among those&#xD;
who had perforce remained at home.&#xD;
Miss Eunice~ Ludlow had' also returned, for she too had&#xD;
been "spending some time at the Springs." The family&#xD;
alone knew the whys and the hows of the all 'important&#xD;
though unusual event. A relative who lived at Saratoga&#xD;
in a style -which in more modern days would have been&#xD;
called "Shoddy," had' sent for Eunice, who by the way was&#xD;
an expert needle-woman, to come and assist .them with&#xD;
their summer's sewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
Of ~~ourse Cousin John would attend to the expenses of&#xD;
~" trav~lIing," at least so the letter read, and ~he geiierously&#xD;
fulfille&amp;amp;~e ~romi8e by proeuripg a pass through the infin-'&#xD;
mice of a baggage inaster~ And now the visit was over&#xD;
a~d Eunice had returned home frill of Odusin John's im.&#xD;
portance and the Saratoga fashions.&#xD;
'It had, been at' Eunice's suggestion that the Aid Society&#xD;
was invited to meet at' Deacon Ludlow's again. Every&#xD;
one knew that the deacon's family h~d declared that they&#xD;
had done more than their part already; but Eunice felt an&#xD;
uneasy.desire to inform her friends of the marvellous things&#xD;
'which she had seen and heard at Saratoga.&#xD;
As a regular party was deemed quite too expensive, it&#xD;
was decided to 'have the "Society." "It' will be much&#xD;
cheaper' than a party," thought .~Mrs. Ludlow, as she&#xD;
membered the tea regulations; "and we can take a little&#xD;
extra pains to invite those we want, and those we don't&#xD;
want can be. left to find it out for themselves."&#xD;
The appointed day came, and with it came "The Aid&#xD;
Society." Among the first arrivals ~was Mrs. J. Pixley&#xD;
Smith arrayed in the stiff silk dress and the same prodigious&#xD;
amount of jewelry in which she had appeared on the occa~&#xD;
sion of Mrs. Squires' memorable call. Mrs. Bingham the&#xD;
minister's wife, wore the same brown alpaca dress and the&#xD;
same plain linen collar and black velvet bow which Miss&#xD;
Eunice declared she had stuck to ever since tIiey~ear one.&#xD;
Mrs. ' Squires appeared in a dark worsted dress and rich&#xD;
honiton colhw fastened with a cameo pin, which Mrs.&#xD;
Smith thought was very bad taste for any one tbat~ could&#xD;
.afford new fashioned jewelry as well as "Miss Squares,"&#xD;
ass he persisted in calling her.&#xD;

the rep~arkablehccowplishm~nts of little Consin Una ~who&#xD;
is studying French arithmetic, alihougli she is only eight&#xD;
years old.&#xD;
It could ~6t but be observed, that Miss Eunice became&#xD;
somewhat less comm~iunicative after the 'arrival of Mrs.&#xD;
Squires. KnQwing as she did Tthat Mrs. Squires could&#xD;
easily detect the parts of ber story in' which she had been&#xD;
wholly indebted to imagination for he~ facts; and as&#xD;
she thought of the experiences Mrs. Squires might' relate&#xD;
if ~he were only disposed to appreciate her advantages,&#xD;
she looked at Mrs. Squires with pitying' wonder~, for her&#xD;
lost opportunities.&#xD;
There was not any work of importance on hand. The&#xD;
last thing the society had 'attempted was a dozen shirts&#xD;
~,for' Mi $ingham; and these being finished, the question&#xD;
in order was~ to what they should next devote their.&#xD;
effo~ts.&#xD;
"I've' been telling ma," said Miss Eunice, "that I&#xD;
think' we had 'better labor for. the cause of foreign mis-&#xD;
sions. I' heard Mr. Simpson, while I was at Cousin&#xD;
John's. I 'was so much delighted with his farewell ser-&#xD;
mon;~ he, preached it in several places, and I heard it in&#xD;
Saratoga, just before they left for the heathen land. His&#xD;
thitd wife, Miss Stiiiman, was a particular friezid' of' mine;&#xD;
lie, had pi~inted copies of the s~rm6n 'for sale, and I bo~~ght&#xD;
6ne. on her account. Some parts of'it w&amp;amp;e very eloquent&#xD;
indeed." And taking up the pani~hlet8he read aloud: ~&#xD;
"We are possessed of a common~ o~gin, and a 'common&#xD;
&#xD;
inheritance; sent into this breathing world to. work out a.&#xD;
common destiny. Then why should we limit the exercise&#xD;
of our Christian charities and our activ~sympathies, to&#xD;
the circumscribed 'limit of our own neighborhood or&#xD;
county, instead of encompassing in its encircling vastness&#xD;
the great human family of man.&#xD;
"I'm very sorry he did not come. here," said Mrs.&#xD;
Smith, "we could not possibly work for a worthierob-&#xD;
joct; and to show that we aint narrow minded in 'our&#xD;
views. What do you think about it, Miss Squares?"&#xD;
"1 should be very sorry to be in the way of any good&#xD;
,work, but we should be careful not to overlook the duty&#xD;
that lies nearest us; and I was intending to suggest that&#xD;
we give some assistance t~Mrs. Elnier, who is quite sick;.&#xD;
and both her children and herself are in great need of&#xD;
assistance.~~&#xD;
"Aint you mistaken about that?" said Mrs. Ludlow;&#xD;
"I guess there aint anything serious the matter there, you&#xD;
can't believe half you hear now-a-days, the world is so&#xD;
wicked." ~ure I'm not mistaken, for. I called there this&#xD;
"I am&#xD;
afternoon, and found her quite sick of a fever," replied&#xD;
Mrs. Squires.&#xD;
"Dear we," 'said Mrs. Smith, "then how do we know&#xD;
but ~6ii have exposed us all to some terrible disease. If&#xD;
you ~vAs anybody but Miss Squares, and the chief oae of&#xD;
the ire towers of the society, I should say you'd done a&#xD;
dretful unprudent thing a going there."&#xD;
"I think they had better be sent to the poor-hou~e&#xD;

the awful doctrines that Mrs. Lee teaches th~~se that come&#xD;

teaches us 'our own righteousness is filthy rags,' but if&#xD;
you and Mrs. Lee have got so blinded as to think your&#xD;
own works can save you, I don't see that you can do bet-&#xD;
ter than improve tho opportunity, and leave the Society to&#xD;
a wider field of usefulness. If Mrs. Thee knows about&#xD;
'em, and she ought to I'm sure, why th# ;she must count&#xD;
this fever a special providence in her behalf."&#xD;

I thought we ought t~ feel it a privilege to avail ourselves&#xD;
of such an opportunity to assist in the great cause. The&#xD;

and Xextravagant, besides being low and poor. I don't&#xD;
want to prejudice nobody, but facts is facts, and what Ii&#xD;
say is to be depended on. Everybody knows - that family..&#xD;
got along well enough before~ he went away; but the way&#xD;
she has managed since, just diows how much she knows.&#xD;
Miss Ludlow knows aioue it as well as I do, this big blue&#xD;
velvet chair is bne of her extravagances; it looked just&#xD;
like new when she sold it here, anSI they just took it out&#xD;
of charity; "here Mrs. Smith ceased her violent rocking,&#xD;
and arose for the ladies to - express their horror or their&#xD;
admiration, as their expressions were divided between the&#xD;
chair and its former owner.&#xD;
- "That's nothing at'all compared to the pin that opened&#xD;
my eyes," continued Mrs. Smith. "After J~ie had be~n gone&#xD;
a spell, and I heard how she was selling off her fineries, I&#xD;
knew she had a costly pin, and so I went over prepared to&#xD;
give her full as much' as it was -worth in old gold.&#xD;
But I wan't going to buy a cat in a bag, so I just give~ a&#xD;
good look at it. I knew it was genniwine, because- he sent&#xD;
it to her from Calaforny, and everything is genniwine that&#xD;
comes from there. But such a pin you never did see.&#xD;
"On the front side of it t~ere was a locket lid, and under&#xD;
it was George Elmer just as natural as life, on1~ his face'&#xD;
was peekeder than ever, and' his beard longer. It looked&#xD;

&#xD;
as though he had not shaved sence he went away. On the&#xD;
outside of the lid was some plain checkered work; but the&#xD;
inside ~f it boat everything. It was nothing more nor less&#xD;
than a young one with a night-gown on, . and a pair of&#xD;
wings on its back. I could not see that it looked anything&#xD;
like their cubs only, them everlasting' curls. I was glad&#xD;
they had m6desty enough to put it inside. I shouldn't be&#xD;
willing to have one of my children taken in such a plight,&#xD;
it's bad enough to have them look like fury around every&#xD;
day. But the motto capped the climax. I copied it with&#xD;
my big gold pencil, it read '~ dieu pour vous.' I did not&#xD;
ask her what it meant, for I did not want to condescend,&#xD;
but my niece translated it for me. It's French, and means&#xD;
'ado for you.' I must say it's rather proper after all,&#xD;
for she made a fuss about him, after he had gone, and I&#xD;
s'pose he to~k this way to return the compliment, and make&#xD;
an ado for her. Of course such a pin would not do for a&#xD;
person of any taste, and so I did not even make, her an&#xD;
offer for it."&#xD;
£&#xD;
,'Thre beard of that pin before, nay husband offered to&#xD;
take it once, on some rent that she wanted to get out of&#xD;
* paying; he managed to get an old clock and that was all.&#xD;
I guess she had rather stick to her finery, than to pay her&#xD;
honest debts," said Mrs. Shax;pe.&#xD;
The conversation was here interrupted by the entrance&#xD;
of Dea~on Ludlow and Rev. Mr. Biugharn, who had been&#xD;
invited to take tea with the ladies Sam Ludlow soon&#xD;
made his appearance also. He was being got ready for&#xD;
school in a distant town, and this fact seemed to add so&#xD;
much to his social importance, that he was now expected~ to&#xD;
be introduced to company.&#xD;
* It did not however cause him to' forget any of his old&#xD;
&#xD;
tricks, for he invariably managed to say or do something&#xD;
to vex and mortify his sisters.&#xD;
The conversation seemed to take a more religious turn&#xD;
upon the entrance of the minister. Mrs. Sharpe began to&#xD;
express her interest in a revival which was in successful&#xD;
progress in a neighboring town, and where two of her&#xD;
nieces had been hopefully converted.&#xD;
"That's just what we, want here," said Mrs. Smith,&#xD;
"I've been telling Mr. Smith I did so wish there was an&#xD;
opportunity for him to gdt religion.&#xD;
"There was a wonderful awakening at Saratoga, while&#xD;
I wa~ at Cousin John's. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson's visit&#xD;
caused a great deal of emotion there; perhaps you would&#xD;
like to look at his farewell sermon," said Eunice, handing&#xD;
Mr. Bingham her printed copy.&#xD;
"Maybe the ladies would like to heai~ some of it read&#xD;
aloud," suggested Mrs. Ludlow.&#xD;
"I should so," replied Mrs. Smith.&#xD;
And Mr. Biugham read from the closing paragraphs : -&#xD;
"We have now voluntarily banished ourselves from all&#xD;
the endearments, the attractions and refinements, of a home&#xD;
in civilized life. Turned our backs upon all these to&#xD;
become laboring exiles, in that far distant portion of the&#xD;
lord's vineyard, to which we now pray the gales to waft.&#xD;
us swiftly ~onward, though at the risk of a watery grave."&#xD;
"I'm afraid very few of us would be willing to follow&#xD;
Miss Simpson's noble example, and leave all to follow the&#xD;
Lord!" exclaimed Eunice, with a patient sigh of unappre~&#xD;
cited merit.&#xD;
"That could be decided better if more missionaries come&#xD;
over after wives;" said Sam, with a significant grin, "I&#xD;
rather guess there* would be something of a scattering&#xD;
among the old maids."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8269-00000143"/>&#xD;
Mrs. Smith and Mra. Sharpe'exchanged smiles. Mrs.&#xD;
Squires directed her eyes more closely to her work. Mr.&#xD;
Bingharn becazn~e silently interested in the sermon, and a&#xD;
pause ensued, until Mrs. Ludlow announced that "tea&#xD;
was ready."&#xD;
On th~ Society book it was written that there should&#xD;
always be a plain tea, "Biscuit and apple-sauce, and&#xD;
only one kind of cake." Some of the guests were therefore&#xD;
a little surprised, when, on taking seats at the table, they&#xD;
were served with soda biscuit, ~raised biscuit, buns, and&#xD;
strawberry shortcake, cider apple-sauce, crab-apple sauce,&#xD;
pineapple, and apple jelly. Then there were fruit cake,&#xD;
plain cake, and cookies.&#xD;
Mrs. Sharpe thought they were liable to a line, for break-&#xD;
ing the rules of the ~ciety. But Miss Eunice explained&#xD;
it very satisfactorily, "You aji see there's only biscuit&#xD;
and apple-sauce, and as for the cake, there is only one kind,&#xD;
the fruit cake is just like the other, only it has some raisins&#xD;
and a little citron stirred in, and the cookies are just the&#xD;
8ame dough with a little more flour, and a few caraways&#xD;
added."&#xD;
Mrs. Smith said, that according to her ideas, it was&#xD;
breaking the rules in the right directiQn, and for her part&#xD;
she wa~ willing to swallow the offence, as she helped&#xD;
herself, to .a large slice of fruit cake, laughing audibly at&#xD;
her own atten4pted wit.&#xD;
SQOI~. after tea Mr. and Mrs. Bingham expressed their&#xD;
desire, to, leave, ~. M~. IBingham had promised to make a&#xD;
sick call, and Mrs. ~4gham was to go to see Mrs. Lee,&#xD;
whom she had not seen in a long time, and her husband&#xD;
was to join her a1 Mrs. Lee's, to return home.&#xD;
There was an imn~ediate lengthening. of faces as Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
276&#xD;
&#xD;
Bingham spoke of going, and such a universal expression&#xD;
of interest m the welfare of Zion, and such a desire for a&#xD;
special effort expressed by several, that Mr. Bingham felt&#xD;
compelled to propose obtaining the assistance of Mr. Phil-&#xD;
lips, a noted revivalist, to help in the work, and it was&#xD;
decided that he should write im~nediatelyffor the desired aid.&#xD;
Miss Eunice expressed her regret at the necessity of the&#xD;
sick call, and wished the visit to Mrs. Lee could be post-~&#xD;
poned, the company would regret so much to lose them so&#xD;
early in the evening.&#xD;
"Better have 'em find out who that chap at Mrs. Lee's&#xD;
is," said Sam, with his, usual significant leer at IEunice~&#xD;
No one replied. Mr. Bingham was called upon to address&#xD;
the Throne of Grace, and made a short but earnest prayer,&#xD;
when Mr. and Mrs. Bingham. bade the company good&#xD;
night. As soon as they were out of hearing, Sam said&#xD;
"That was a pretty good oration to the Lord." And on&#xD;
being reproved for his irreverence, very gravely asked his&#xD;
mother to explain the difference between an "oration to&#xD;
the Lord," and an "address to the Throne. of Grace."&#xD;
You see I am going to school and I. want to understand&#xD;
these things."&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
&#xD;
T Mrs. Lee's, Mr. Bingham found Dr. Chases&#xD;
Lee, the person to whom Sam Ludlow had refer-&#xD;
ence. He is a nephew of the late Dr. ,Lee, and&#xD;
has stopped ~to pay a visit on his return from Cali-&#xD;
fornia. 'It is not his first visit to our little town; years before&#xD;
he bad 'come hither with the intention of studying medicine&#xD;
with his uncle. The intention, however, had been hastily&#xD;
overruled by. the sad dispensation, with which our story&#xD;
begins, ahd after his uncle's lamented death he had com-&#xD;
pleted. his. course in a neighboring city, and subsequently&#xD;
practiced in San Francisco, where his earnest efforts had&#xD;
been rewarded by the esteem and confidence of a large&#xD;
and thriving practice, as well as by those more material&#xD;
returns which the world counts as the criterion of success.&#xD;
The relation of Dr. Lee's pleasant adventures, assisted&#xD;
no doubt by her own determination not 'to dwell upon sad&#xD;
or painful memories during his visit, had already told&#xD;
favorably upon Mrs. Lee's health, and nearly every ple~ant&#xD;
day found them riding or, walking out in company.&#xD;
On one of these occasions, as they were passing the&#xD;
residence Qf the Smiths, the attention of Dr. Lee was&#xD;
arrested. by the dog Bounce lying near the gate, and w~ilk-&#xD;
ing more slowly and eying the Aog with increased interest&#xD;
he said, "I declare, aunty, that dog looks like an old&#xD;
acquaintance."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
His interest in the noble fellow increased, as Bounce im~&#xD;
mediately jumped i~p and running up to them, placed his&#xD;
left foot immediately upon tbe Doctor's band. "I. really&#xD;
believe I have found an old patient said the Doctor."&#xD;
"And so, I am to inti~r that your practice extended to&#xD;
dogs," said Mrs. Lee, smiling at the rapid progress of&#xD;
their mutual recognition.&#xD;
"I don't hesitate to own it did to this fellow," replied.&#xD;
the Doctor examining a well-defined scar on Bounce's. still&#xD;
extended foot. "I think there~s no mistake; this is poor&#xD;
Elmer's dQg, and that scar shows the very spot where hjs&#xD;
foot was hurt while he was in the mines."&#xD;
"Was it George Elmer?" asked Mrs. Lee, with~ inter-&#xD;
est, "the young man who ~went from this place?" -&#xD;
"I never knew where he was from, I think the name&#xD;
was George - the man was sick in the hospital, and had a&#xD;
pretty severe time with a prevailing fever. ~'&#xD;
"Yes, I believe he died of it, after a time; at least that&#xD;
was the report which was brought back here."&#xD;
"Oh no, he did not die of the fever; he was very ill&#xD;
for a long time, but I remember distimitly that he recov-&#xD;
ered and went to work again."&#xD;
"Did you ever see Smith, the shoemaker?"&#xD;
"I don't know that I did; there were any number of&#xD;
Smiths there but I don't recollec~ having a particular&#xD;
acquaintance with any of them."&#xD;
"Then you never knew what became of Elmer after his.&#xD;
sickness?" said Mrs. Lee inquiringly.&#xD;
"I think~he was in the hospital when I left, tind that&#xD;
i~as some months afterward."&#xD;
Mrs. Lee was very much interested in what she had&#xD;
leai~ned of the husband of her friend, and that very even-&#xD;

ing availed herself of the opportunity, while her nephew&#xD;
was writing to, his family, of going out to carry to' Mrs.&#xD;
]lrmer, the intelligence which she was so happy to be the&#xD;
medium of conveying.&#xD;
As, she approached the house and was thinking how to&#xD;
give expression to the good news in store for her friend,&#xD;
little Mary, who 'had discovered her approach, ran out to&#xD;
mneet4ier, exclaiming,&#xD;
"How glad I am you have come! mamma 'has got a&#xD;
letter and, it made her almost well, and 'my papa, was alive&#xD;
all the time, and Mr. Smith told a naughty story ; is it not&#xD;
wonderful?".&#xD;
Mrs. Lee kissed the little girl in congratulation, and&#xD;
went into the house, where her tears of sympathy were&#xD;
soon mingled with the drops of joy that flowed freely down&#xD;
Susan's face as jhey spoke together words of gratitude to&#xD;
God for the blessed tidings which had been so long delayed.&#xD;
We cannot furnish our ,readers a -copy of the letter&#xD;
wich gave Susan so much pleasure,. for she had not that&#xD;
vuga ambition of display which might have induced some&#xD;
to send, it to the newspapers; nor did she circulate it about&#xD;
for neighborhood commentt .andceriticism. -Those, there-&#xD;
fore, who wish -to know more of George Ehlmer will be&#xD;
compelled 'to go with us on the long journey to California.&#xD;
And as it will only be fair to give our friends a parting&#xD;
cal before taking leave of them for the long journey, we&#xD;
will stop at the meeting-house on the way.&#xD;
The ne* lamps are now in constant use, for while we&#xD;
hav  l~,n engaged in other matters, the revival has not,&#xD;

&#xD;
of Rev. Mr. Phillips, some may wish a more formal intro-&#xD;
duction to this distinguished revivalist. He is a person&#xD;
rather above the medium height, with large hazel eyes&#xD;
which, but for a total lack of expression, might be called&#xD;
beautiful. His coal-black hair was parted in a fashion which&#xD;
showed no neglect from its owner ; his manner is affable&#xD;
and conciliating, and is dress of glossy black broadcloth&#xD;
-as. faultless as the most fastidious tailor could devise. Some&#xD;
insinuating person has intimated that a sudden improve-&#xD;
~ment in his personal appearance is closely connected with&#xD;
the recent death of his wife; and a facetious friend has&#xD;
hinted that even his hair has becomed5everal shades darker&#xD;
to match the new'mourning suit ; but of'the truth of these&#xD;
'hints we are not personally responsible, although certain&#xD;
it is, that his popularity has never, suffered in consequence&#xD;
of the fact that Mr. Phillips is a widower.&#xD;
His sermons, in the option of some, were mere plati-&#xD;
tudes, with a faint shadow pf an idea. clothed in one weak&#xD;
syllogism after another, bt without force or pith, whl&#xD;
his prayers were only a medley of threatened wrath to&#xD;
evil doers, a report of neighborhood gossip, and a dispen-&#xD;
sation of full and free salvation to the elect ; but whatever&#xD;
of adverse criticism might be bestowed upon these efforts,&#xD;
there was a charm and sweetness in the melody of his voice&#xD;
to which not even the most hostile could~ listen without&#xD;
admiration. The sentiments which he made this heaven-&#xD;
bestowed talent the means of conveying, may be better.&#xD;
learned from one of his favorite hymns, than from any&#xD;
words of ours, and we copy one of them from the printed&#xD;
sheets which were liberally distributed throughout the&#xD;

It is true that Smith has left George Elmer very sick&#xD;
indeed, and the fever ha~ long seemed' to defy the physi-&#xD;
cian's skill and the nurse's care. Before this calamity had&#xD;
overtaken him, however, he had, while, yet the enthu-.&#xD;
siasm of a new enterprise lasted, accumulated a thousand&#xD;
dollars which he had confided to Smith's offered charge for&#xD;
the little family at home. Elmer was too ill at the time&#xD;
of the transaction to attend to any legal papers, and the&#xD;
worse sickness which followed had so impaired his mem~&#xD;
ory that he had never even wondered why- it was never&#xD;
heard from. He had lingered ~long, ~conscious only of the&#xD;
change from intense pain to a languid stupor, and when&#xD;
the violence of the disease had at last passed away, the&#xD;
wild expression of the eye and the strange 'incoherence of&#xD;
speech formed no uncertain indication of the sad havoc of&#xD;
disease.&#xD;
Though his mental faculties had suffered n~ucWunder the&#xD;
painful malady, yet as his strength returned, with it came&#xD;
back so much of George Elmer's former enterprise that he&#xD;
was soon ahle to' apply himself to the practice of his old&#xD;
business of dentistry.&#xD;
A little office bad been provided in a part of -the hospi~&#xD;
tal for a former patient, and as such services were in great&#xD;
demand and George had always been a skilful workman,&#xD;
he was soon gaining a handsome remuneration ;~ he never&#xD;
spoke of his family or friends, and was always quiet and&#xD;
reserved towards every one except the little children, who -&#xD;
frequently came in to bring flowers or ~dainties to the pa&#xD;

tents, and on whom he bestowed the curious little devices,&#xD;
the manufacture of which occupied his leisure.&#xD;
There was in the same ward with Elmer a man by the&#xD;
name of Goulding, who had been seriously injured by the&#xD;
blasting of a rock, and brought in some time after Elmer.&#xD;
For many weeks each failed to recognize the other as an&#xD;
old acquaintance, and former partner; yet it was not very&#xD;
strange, for Goulding bad supposed with many others that&#xD;
Elmer had died of the fever; and the' effects of that fearful&#xD;
malady upon the memory of the latter, had prevented his&#xD;
recognizing any person except those who had been con~&#xD;
stantly with him.&#xD;
It was a' matter of surprise to Goulding that after a rec-&#xD;
ognition had, taken place, Elmer received with such&#xD;
indifference his accounts of the richness of the claims in~&#xD;
which they' owned a mutual interest; and not until one&#xD;
evening when Mrs. Goulding had, come in as usual to&#xD;
spend an hour' with her husband did Elmer appear fully&#xD;
to have recovered his former self. Goulding had asked&#xD;
his wife to sing for him, and as sh~ finished the second&#xD;
starrza of that sweet little song entitled "Star of the Eve.&#xD;
ning," noticing the strange effect the words seemed to&#xD;
have upon his friend, Goulding begged her to stop.&#xD;
Elmer's face was pale with emotion, and his eyes dim&#xD;
with unshed tears, as he asked in a tremulous voice,&#xD;
"Where's my wife? Where's Susan, and why does not&#xD;
she come and sing the Shining Star to me?"&#xD;
Some of the attendants were alarmed, and feared a re-&#xD;
.lapse of the disease, but they soon earned that it was only&#xD;
the sweet, soothing power of' music that had roused that&#xD;
hidden chain in 'which the thoughts of those lie loved had&#xD;

of that far-away fireside, the' worn and wasted form of the&#xD;
aged grandmother, the earnest but uncomplaining face of&#xD;
his wife, and the happy voices of his' little children, seemed&#xD;
to come like a beacon of life and hope to the storm-bound,&#xD;
ocean-wreckcd mariner. ile soon indicted the letter, of the&#xD;
safe arrival of which we have learned, and as he intends&#xD;
very soon to follow it, we will go back'to find what prepara-&#xD;
tions are being made for his return.&#xD;
The news of the arrival of a letter from George Elmer&#xD;
soon spread through the town, where it' shared with the&#xD;
sayings and doings of the new converts, among whom&#xD;
Sam Ludlow and J. P. Smith were prominent in being the&#xD;
principal topics of conversation.&#xD;
Mr. J. Pixley Smith was among the' first to call upon&#xD;
Mrs. Elmer to inquire the particulars of the letter; and as,&#xD;
the fdcts in relation to the money', and also some allusions&#xD;
to the dog 'came to light, Smith's interest in the affair be-&#xD;
came decidedly personal,, and he interrupted Mrs. Elmer&#xD;
before ~she had finished reading, by saying,&#xD;
"I've been intending this long time to come' in and ex-&#xD;
plain matters to you. You know we have tried to share&#xD;
the burden of your children with you, and then we've kept&#xD;
the dog; dogs 'are great eaters, and it would eat you out&#xD;
of house and home to have such a voracious fellow as&#xD;
Bounce around; but if you want 'the critter, you can have&#xD;
him. Then as to money matters, you ~eemed so comfort-&#xD;
able I thought it best to ~save what I had for you till a&#xD;
rainy day; but if you think you need any, Is'pose I must&#xD;
let you have some, though women folksin general squan-&#xD;
der it awfully."&#xD;
Mrs. Elmer might perhaps have been overcome with&#xD;
indignation at this speech had not her heart been too full&#xD;

of gladness at the thought of her husband's return, and she&#xD;
replied, "God -has taken care of us so far, and he will not&#xD;
forsake us now.- You can bring -the .money or leave it to&#xD;
settle with Mr. Elmer, for II am not anxious to have any&#xD;
transactions with you."&#xD;
Mr. Smith felt very angry at the honest indignation&#xD;
which 1~frs. Elmer had expressed, but as there was now no&#xD;
apparent benefit to. be derived from delay, he immediately&#xD;
applied himself to collecting the amount.&#xD;
- He availed himself of the advantage which his conspicu-.&#xD;
ousness in the late revival had given him, and as he was&#xD;
now counted among the "active brethren," and his wife&#xD;
directress in "The Muffictegawny Missionary Aid Society,"&#xD;
the brilliant thQught of circulating a subscription paper for&#xD;
the benefit of that popular institution, occurred to him, and&#xD;
wishing to show his liberality, his .zeal, and his pecuniary&#xD;
ability in one bold stroke, he headed the list with a donation&#xD;
of one hundred dollars. It was soon increased by the addi-&#xD;
tion of smaller sums, and in a short time he was able to&#xD;
hand over the .thousand to Mrs~ Elmer, beside leaving a&#xD;
comfortable sum for his own pocket.&#xD;
The dog which had been pronounced "a nuisance,"&#xD;
"a cuss," and "a filthy squadruped," at the Smith resi-.&#xD;
deuce, was the subject of an excited "family scene" when&#xD;
Smith declared his intention to give it away. Mrs. Smith&#xD;
called him a cruel, hard-hearted iiionste~ to give away the&#xD;
only thing the children ever did care anything about. The&#xD;
girls pouted, and declared they wouldn't' go to school;&#xD;
Ferdinand shut Bounce in the bedroom, and placing him-&#xD;
self against the door, armed with his father's cane declared&#xD;
"he'd see if the old man dared to touch his dorg." Mean-&#xD;
time Smith retreated to the back yard and waited till the -&#xD;
&#xD;
~1&#xD;
&#xD;
excitement was over,' and then coaxing Bounce with a beef -&#xD;
bone which he had picked up in the morning at a butchei9s&#xD;
stall and had been carrying for that purpose all day, he led&#xD;
the dog in the direction of' Mrs. Elmer's, where he was&#xD;
soon discovered by Johnnie, who had been some time&#xD;
watching for his appearance. He was soon joined by&#xD;
Mary to whom he had conveyed information of the import&#xD;
tant arrival.&#xD;
There was a very joyful meeting between the little girl&#xD;
and her old friend who seemed to forget the ill usage he&#xD;
bad received from the youthful Smiths so much as to make&#xD;
every demonstration of friendship to Johnnie and Georgie&#xD;
to whom she gave him the most flattering introduction.&#xD;
As the former annoyances were removed, Bounce became&#xD;
not only the friend and companion of the Elmers, but the&#xD;
favorite of the neighborhood, where his somewhat unusual&#xD;
history had made him an object of more than ordinary&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
Mis. Maddock was quite overcome with delight at the&#xD;
good fortune of the Elmers, although she declared it had&#xD;
all happened just as she had expected ever since she heard&#xD;
that dream.&#xD;
Mrs. Lee improved the earliest opportunity which Har-&#xD;
riet's visit afforded to investigate the affair of the mysterious&#xD;
disappearance of the note, and had succeeded in settling&#xD;
it with Deacon Ludlow by giving him a receipt in full on -&#xD;
his paying the exact amount which had been enclosed in&#xD;
the letter. The deacon congratulated himself on being&#xD;
abundantly able to meet the demand, expressing a~ the&#xD;
same time his satisfaction that Sam was done sowing&#xD;
his wild oats and had "got religion" now, while it was&#xD;
evident that the thought of Sam's making any restitution&#xD;

*Those who wish to be informed of this young gentleman&#xD;
from his own words, can do so by reading a letter which&#xD;
has lately been received from him by John Sharpe, a son&#xD;
of Mrs. Elmer's former landlord.&#xD;
DEAR JAcK, - It's an awful long time since I heard from&#xD;
you. I was dreadful sorry YOU got shut up just as I cam~&#xD;
away, for I wanted to see you desperately. I'm sorry you&#xD;
want there to get religion when I did; I toll you it's the&#xD;
best investment I've made lately, for it helps a fellow along&#xD;
mightily. This is a first rate school; I can stay out as late&#xD;
as I please, and no questions asked, but if one of the chaps&#xD;
that hasn't got religion is caught away from his room after&#xD;
nine, he gets a walking ticket, whew!&#xD;
I tell youJackwe had a gay old examination. I got ex-&#xD;
cused from my classes to practise my oration. . I wrote on&#xD;
"Religious Forms," for I knew all the old dominies and&#xD;
deacons would be appointed judges, and the fellow that put&#xD;
in the most piety would get the prize. I took care to put&#xD;
in a good rouser about the "old dragon and the old seven&#xD;
hills." You see it's always safe to give popery a death&#xD;
blow; besides, denunciation suits my style of oratory.&#xD;
- It took like a molasses fly-trap, and I got a tremendous&#xD;
big Bible for the first prize. I sold i{ for four fifty, and our&#xD;
society, the L. A.'s had a gay old spree on that, you may&#xD;
bet. We have a uniform here for parade days and such&#xD;
like. ~ It's a grand arrangement, for we wear the old things&#xD;
that the others leave, and then the money answers lots of&#xD;
purposes.&#xD;
There's an ~pisc9pal society here; they've got a real nice&#xD;
&#xD;
288&amp;amp;.&#xD;
&#xD;
meetinghouse, and a very polite chap for a minister. They&#xD;
are ever so popular, and I had quite a notion of joining.&#xD;
them, but the fellow has taken a pious turn of late and be-&#xD;
gins to talk about self-denial and alms deeds in a way that&#xD;
I don't relish. I. like the notion of every-day piety; that&#xD;
means something you can always make useful. Now's the&#xD;
present time, and a bird in the hand is worth two in the&#xD;
bush. This going without your beef-steak and sticking to&#xD;
codfish and mackerel six weeks in March is what I call a 9&#xD;
scaly performance. I wish you would Write as soon as pos-&#xD;
sible and tell me how all the folks are getting along. I won-&#xD;
der if Eunice will make out to catch Mr. Phillips. Pin&#xD;
glad you kept dark about that old Elmer affair. I have&#xD;
never felt just right about it; I knew the old man would&#xD;
fork over if I only got religion. After all it was not a&#xD;
mighty sight meaner than his buying her chairs for less than&#xD;
half they were worth, because he knew sh.e was obliged to&#xD;
sell them. If ever I make a lift again, it will be on an Ex-&#xD;
press Office or a bank; there's something mean in robbing a&#xD;
poor widow, but then if I get as much saving faith as the&#xD;
old man has, I shan't be so scrupulous. I am going into&#xD;
the storage and foraging business as soon as I get through&#xD;
here, and if that don't pay I may come back and marry&#xD;
Mary Elmer, by way ~f righting old, scores; that is if&#xD;
Elmer really brings hack the dust.&#xD;
Yours forever,&#xD;
SAM LUDLOW.&#xD;
P.S. Please direct your letter to Miss Sarah Loomis&#xD;
care of S. Ludlow Esq. You see we are expected to have&#xD;
our letters sent to the care of the professors, who take.pains&#xD;
to read them for us, and I want to save them that trouble.&#xD;

Mr. Smith, Mrs. Elmer's first care was to secure for her-&#xD;
self and family a home, where they and her expected hus-&#xD;
band would ~be more comfortable.. And although their&#xD;
present prosperity, as indicated in George's letter, might&#xD;
warrant them in selecting some more aspiring locality, it&#xD;
was Susan's highest ambition to return to the little~ cot-&#xD;
tage where~ they had first started housekeeping, and from&#xD;
which George had gone forth on his journey.&#xD;
-' Here the pleasures of their early wedded years had&#xD;
been crowned with joy, by the birth of their first-born&#xD;
child, the darling Mary; and here Johnnie had received a&#xD;
father's smile of welcome, and a mother's kiss of' love, as&#xD;
he added new happiness to a home which had. been already&#xD;
full of light and gladness. And in later years, when the&#xD;
rough winds of adversity seemed untempered to the shorn&#xD;
lambs, and the dark, hard hand of poverty seemed ready&#xD;
to crush them, had little Georgie, brought the smiles of&#xD;
infant innocence to cheer once more the desolate home,&#xD;
and to prevent the thoughts of his mother from flQwing&#xD;
always in the same dark channel.&#xD;
Here, too, had been learned many a lesson of trusting&#xD;
hope, and patient, quiet submission, from the example of&#xD;
that oged mother, whose memory was still embalmed in&#xD;
the sighs, and dewed with the tears of affectionate reinem-&#xD;
branee.&#xD;
The little cottage was soon engaged, and the few prepa-&#xD;
rations for moving wcr~ quickly completed. Mrs. Mad-&#xD;
dock, with characteristic liberality, declared that it would&#xD;
be time enough for her to take the rest, when George&#xD;
Elmer was safeAlome again.&#xD;
As ,Susan and the childreit were following their little&#xD;
stock of furniture to their new home, she was startled by&#xD;

&#xD;
the sight of a carriage at the door, and quite excited at the&#xD;
thought that her husband had possibly preceded her there.&#xD;
Her surprise abated, however, when on entering the house&#xD;
she found her visitor to be Mrs. Bennet Squiree, who had&#xD;
lately returned from an absence of several weeks9&#xD;
It had been the surprise and horror of many of her&#xD;
neighbors, that she could think of going away just in the&#xD;
midst of the revival; and Mrs. Smith had even gone so&#xD;
far as publicly to propose her name as a subject for their&#xD;
prayers.&#xD;
Certainly the religion of Mrs. Squires was very differ-&#xD;
ent from that of Mrs. Smith; for she was always ready to&#xD;
assist the poor by her sympathy and her bounty, witliout&#xD;
making a catalogue of their faults. While she gave to her&#xD;
equals or her superiors in worldly things, the offices of&#xD;
kindness, without taking the census of their virtues; she&#xD;
never made it her business to censure or find fault with&#xD;
her clergyman, even though his sermons contained doc-&#xD;
trines and opinions quite at variance with her own. Nor&#xD;
did she sneer at, or find fault with those persons who&#xD;
thought they found aids to piety and excellence in things&#xD;
which ~to her judgment appeared only the excitement of&#xD;
passion, or the sway of popular public sentiment; ever&#xD;
showing a commendable respect for honest differences of&#xD;
opinion and of belief.&#xD;
The object of the present visit added another to the&#xD;
many~kindnesses with whi~Th she had made glad the home&#xD;
of the Elmers; for she had come to place in its old cor-&#xD;
ner the little clock, of whose existence she had first heard&#xD;
at the society at Deacon Ludlow's. She had been anx-&#xD;
ious to give to Susan some token of the pleasure she felt&#xD;
at the new turn of-events, and could not have found a&#xD;
more welcome expression of her kindness.&#xD;

&#xD;
Many other pieces of furniture found their way back;&#xD;
the blue velvet rocking-chair soon took its accustomed&#xD;
commanding~ position in the little front parlor, and really&#xD;
looks almost as bright as before its stay at the Deacon's,&#xD;
where the hospitality had never been such as to tell unfa.-&#xD;
vorably upon the parlor furniture. Susan was very glad&#xD;
to get the chair again; it had been one of her few wed-&#xD;
ding presents, and was the gift of a liberal and wealthy&#xD;
friend, in New York City.&#xD;
Deacon Ludlow had shown considerable reluctance at&#xD;
Mrs. Elmer's request to repurchase the chair. "I I I&#xD;
s'pose you know I never offered my furniture for sale,&#xD;
Miss Elmer," he said ;' but Susan distinctly remembered&#xD;
the well~f~igned reluctance with which he had paid her the&#xD;
paltry sum of six dollars for. it. She could almost hear&#xD;
his words again, as he said, "'Taint everybody that would&#xD;
want to buy an odd piece of furniture like that, and you&#xD;
will find it pretty heavy to carry round, if 'you try to sell&#xD;
it that way."&#xD;
Remembering these things as Susan did, she gained&#xD;
courage to urge her request, which the Deacon hesitatingly&#xD;
acknowledged.&#xD;
"I don't know,~ but being ii's you, I shall hey to let&#xD;
you take it for ten'dollars; 'taint a circumstance to what&#xD;
it's worth; besides you see furniture is riz."&#xD;
Susan had just got comfortably settled, when George&#xD;
returned. W~ shall not intrude upon the pleasure of their&#xD;
first meeting; but several weeks have now passed, since&#xD;
the scattered members of the loving household were re-&#xD;
united, and though tender and mournful remembrances of&#xD;
the past mingle with the pleasures of the present hour,&#xD;
and give them a subdued and chastened coloring, theirs&#xD;
&#xD;
25*&#xD;
&#xD;
293&#xD;
&#xD;
is a quiet happiness which glittering splendor and dashing&#xD;
grandeur might covet in vain. -&#xD;
George Elmer sits beside the work-table, reading the&#xD;
last number of the Dental Journal, while Susan sits near,&#xD;
plying her needle as in days of old. Georgie is asleep,&#xD;
and Johnnie is at. play building a miniature village.&#xD;
Jerusha sits in a retired corner, where Mary is assisting&#xD;
her to learn her lesson for the Bible class'. She is still&#xD;
living at Mrs. Lee's, and frequently comes over to visit&#xD;
her early friend. Bounce lies upon a comfortable rug&#xD;
beside the stove, looking contented and happy,. in spite of&#xD;
all the trials and changes through which ~he had passed,&#xD;
and watching his master's eyes whenever they turn, while&#xD;
with an instinct almost human, he makes his master's wel-&#xD;
come understood.&#xD;
When George Elmer had finished reading the paper, he&#xD;
folded it carefully, and laying it upon the table turned to&#xD;
Susan, and in a tone which brought a smile of recognition&#xD;
upon Mary's face, said-, -&#xD;
"Come, Susy, sing The Shining Star."&#xD;
And soon that cheerful room echoed with the well-&#xD;
remembered words, as they all united in the chorus, -&#xD;
&#xD;
.Look upxny soulbe like the lark,&#xD;
That singing soars afar~&#xD;
There's not a eIou~,J1OWOYer dark,&#xD;

adorxied with four huge columns. We have, also, p]&#xD;

LETTERS PROM TIMBER VILLIL     299&#xD;
&#xD;
* Timberville is delightfully situated on both sides of~ a&#xD;
beautiful little strearn, (or, as our enterprising villagers&#xD;
say, it has fine miW privileges,) and surrounded by tree.&#xD;
clad hills. I am never weary looking at our hills, beauti-.&#xD;
ful at all times, but particularly so in the autumn, when&#xD;
they are arrayed in a robe of every variety of color, from&#xD;
the most gorgeous crimson to the softest ash~ "What&#xD;
beautiful hills!" said I, enthusiastically, as I was one day&#xD;
walking with a worthy gentleman. "Yes - yes fine&#xD;
timberland,"~, said he.&#xD;
Our society is very much like the society in all growing&#xD;
villages. We have good people and bad people; rich&#xD;
people and poor people; wise people and ignorant.people;&#xD;
liberal people and stingy people; sharp people and dull&#xD;
people; cute people and numb people; industrious people&#xD;
and lazy people. People who mind their~ own business&#xD;
and people* who mind their neighbors' business. Honest&#xD;
people and dishonest~ people; literary people and illiterate&#xD;
people, and soi disant literary people (excuse that French&#xD;
Word.) We have gay people and serious people; noisy&#xD;
people and quiet people; people who go to church and&#xD;
people who stay away from church. We have temperate&#xD;
people and intemperate people. People ~ho read the&#xD;
newspaper, and people who have "other fish to fry."&#xD;
People who take "' Godey," and people who borrow&#xD;
" Godey." We shall certainly be a city before many&#xD;
years.&#xD;
We have all sorts of societies, too. Missionary socie-&#xD;
ties, Bible societies, tract societies, sewing societies,&#xD;
maternal societies, mutual improvement societies, sons of&#xD;
temperance and daughters of temperance societies, odd&#xD;
fellows' societies,' and an odd ladies' society, composed&#xD;
&#xD;
chiefly of ancient maidens. We have freemasons~ socie-&#xD;
ties, literary societies, woman's rights societies, anti-every-&#xD;
thing societies, benevolent societies for all sorts of objects,&#xD;
"too numerous to mention," (as the menagerie bills say&#xD;
when they get down to the monkeys.) In short, we have&#xD;
every kind of society that you can possibly mention. Are&#xD;
we not in a fair way of being a city?&#xD;
As is the 'case in almost all new enterprising villages,&#xD;
the chief distinction among us is that of "rich and poor."&#xD;
So soon as a man is able to put up, or even to hire, a large&#xD;
house with two parlors ~and folding-doors, and furnish it&#xD;
showily, he tak~s his standing among the first. The one&#xD;
grand object of the Timbervillians is to get rich. They&#xD;
are all agog just now about California. Mr. Martin, and&#xD;
Mr. Crandal, and Mr. Wiggins, have almost made up&#xD;
their minds to abandon their respective occupations and set&#xD;
off for the gold country; and their wives are quite de-&#xD;
lighted with the idea; for Mrs. Martin wants a great many'&#xD;
things which Mr. Martin, rich as he-is, cannot afford now.&#xD;
And Mrs. Crandal is very desirous that Mr. Crandal&#xD;
should go, in order that he may come back able to build a&#xD;
grander house than Mr. Martin's, with larger columns and&#xD;
more green blinds. She knows she's as good as Mrs.&#xD;
Martin, any day, and she'd like to let other people know it.&#xD;
And Mrs. Wiggins teases her husband from morning till&#xD;
night to "Go to C~4iforny, where they say you've Qnly&#xD;
to dig up the gold just as you would potterss" for she&#xD;
does want a house of her oww, and a sofy and some cuttings&#xD;
as good as that stuck-up Mrs. Crandal's; and she fears&#xD;
that ~Mr. Wiggins will never be able to get them as long as&#xD;
he stays here and delves away at his trade. "Gold!&#xD;
gold! gold ! "~ is the cry from every mouth, old and young.&#xD;
Oh, we shall soon be a city.&#xD;

LETTERS FROM TIMBER fILLE~&#xD;
&#xD;
I would like to introduce you to some of our first, and&#xD;
let you see in~ what sort of society I have the honor to&#xD;
mingle. Now do not suppose that I have procured the&#xD;
ability to present you among the "upper ten," by one of&#xD;
the aforesaid tall houses with big parlors and folding-&#xD;
doors.; by no means; I am only a boarder in Timberville.&#xD;
But where shall we go? to a party? Now, pray, don't&#xD;
turn up your nose at the idea of a party in Tiznberville.&#xD;
I assure you, we have our parties, real genuine, ones, too,&#xD;
as good as any in Philadelphia assemble at ten clock&#xD;
have supper at twelve or one dance all night, and&#xD;
"don't, go home till morning" - for the Timbervillians&#xD;
would think it very ungenteel and countrified to keep&#xD;
reasonable, hours. We must be a city very soon.&#xD;
But, on reflection, I think I'll not take you to a party&#xD;
they are too promiscuous. Nor will I bore you with a.&#xD;
sociable tea-drinking decidedly one of the most tiresome&#xD;
things in the world, the world over. And in Timberville&#xD;
they are just what they are everywhere else, (making&#xD;
allowance for some few local peculiarities.) The- ladies&#xD;
collecting in little knots; 'same talkin&#xD;
innocently discussion the fashions, g scandal, some more&#xD;
g             but by far the greater&#xD;
~portion descanting u~on'the various trials and troubles they-&#xD;
have with their "helps;" while the very small sprinkling&#xD;
ot the sterner sex ~2 who never talk at such gatherings,&#xD;
and who go only because their wives insist upon it are&#xD;
leaning back in their chairs against the wall, half asleep,&#xD;
and heartily wishing thepiselves at home, or in some place&#xD;
more congenial with their tastes.&#xD;
Suppose you go with me to one of our numerous socie-&#xD;
ties. Don't be alarmed; it's. iiot ~o the "o~1d ladies," nor&#xD;
the "daughters of temperance," nor the " Woni~ui's rights&#xD;
&#xD;
society," that we are going., I am not a member of any&#xD;
of them. But put on your fix-ups, and prepare to accom-&#xD;
pany me to the "Timberville literary circle," where you&#xD;
will be sure to meet the elite (another French word&#xD;
pardon me perhaps, however, you do not dislike to see&#xD;
French and English mixed together as badly as I do).&#xD;
We are to meet this ve~ry evening at the hospitable mansion&#xD;
of Mrs. Bolton, a very literary lady; but you shall see for&#xD;
yourself- I'll not anticipate. Stop a moment; I must&#xD;
put" Godey"in my pocket. Not the veritable individual&#xD;
himself. If his own account is to be trusted, that would&#xD;
be rather more than I could do. But my "Godey's&#xD;
Lady's Book" for the month. 1 am one of the readers for&#xD;
this evening, and I find, by experience,~that I am not half&#xD;
as welcome when I come armed and equipped with an'&#xD;
original article as when I bring my "Godey."&#xD;
So here we go; and as we are on our way, I will 'tell&#xD;
you something about our "circle," and how I, little I,&#xD;
came to be a member of so august 'a body. It was on this&#xD;
wise. The good people discovered that I took the news-&#xD;
papers; 'not a very common thing in Timberville, where it&#xD;
'is usually as much as the inhabitants can "afford "ito take&#xD;
some one of the village papers, of which we have three ~.&#xD;
organs of the three political parties of the place - and&#xD;
which blaze away at each other with a zeal ' worthy the&#xD;
cause, and in a style equal 'to any of the city organs.&#xD;
Young Mr.. Morgan, the head clerk at the post-office, was&#xD;
the first person who promulgated the important fact. He&#xD;
told Miss Carpenter, and Miss Carpenter, who is a member&#xD;
of the literary circle, announced,~at the next meeting of that&#xD;
society, that there was a lady boarding at Mrs. Pratt's who&#xD;
took no less than four papers; Mr. Morgan told her so&#xD;

himself; and she was sure I must be of a decidedly literary&#xD;
turn. In fact, she had her suspi~~jons that I was the author..&#xD;
ess of certain Sonnets signed "Euphrasia," which had&#xD;
been copied into the "Ti~berville Weekly Gazette and&#xD;
People's Adi(ocate.' If so, It would be quite an acquisition&#xD;
to the " circle." (Miss Carpenter herself perpetrates&#xD;
poetry, and is considered quite blue.) The other members&#xD;
thought that if I was not a literary character, I must at least&#xD;
be rick, or I could not afford to take so many papers, not..&#xD;
withstanding I seemed to be living in such a plain, private&#xD;
way. In either case, they decided that it would be safe. to&#xD;
%1fl vite me to attend the circle.&#xD;
In pursuance of this resolution, I was waited upon by,&#xD;
Miss Carpenter and Mrs. Stokes, and favored with a very&#xD;
learned conversation, kept up principally by Miss Car-.&#xD;
penter. Mrs. Stokes is not particularly literary she&#xD;
owes her membership to her very large parlors ~and great&#xD;
skill, in getting up a variety of refreshments.&#xD;
On rising to take leave, the ladies (as is the custom in&#xD;
1~naierv~IIe) apologized most veheni~ntly for not having&#xD;
called before, and urged me very strongly to return their&#xD;
visit; very soon; and~ Mrs. Stokes, after Miss Carpenter&#xD;
had winked hard ~at b6r sevei~al times, to indicate tha~ she&#xD;
was the proper person to perform the office, invited me to&#xD;
attend a literary sawree at her residence, on the ensuing&#xD;
evening. Which Miss Carpenter followed up with the re-&#xD;
mark that she hoped I might find it "a desirable relief&#xD;
from the undiversified monotony of a boarding life." Or&#xD;
it might, as in her own case, "afford a relaxation to the&#xD;
mind after severe application and more profound occupy.&#xD;
tion, to indulge for a time in the perusal of the Jighter&#xD;
literature of The day."&#xD;
&#xD;
I attended the sawree, (as Mrs. Stokes called it,) and&#xD;
being soon after elected a member, have been quite regular&#xD;
in my attendance since. And I assure you it is, as Miss&#xD;
Carpenter predicted, a relief to my mind and an amuse-.&#xD;
ment to my head, to come in contact with the variety of&#xD;
characters which I there meet.&#xD;
But here we are. Sit down beside me on this sofa; the&#xD;
members are not all here yet, and we shall have a little&#xD;
time to chat before we are called to order.&#xD;
That short, dumpy lady, who is bobbing about in a very&#xD;
stiff silk dress flounced nearly to the waist, is our hostess,&#xD;
Mrs. Bolton. She is a great patroness of literature, and&#xD;
herself a personage remarkable erudition, and exces-.&#xD;
sively fond of reading. As she expresses it, she literarily&#xD;
devours her favorite authors. It must be confessed that&#xD;
she knows the names of a good many authors, and a good&#xD;
many booke, though she does not always match them quite&#xD;
correctly. She thinks that Dean Swift has some genius;&#xD;
his "Rasselas" is a proof of it; but it is a gre at pity that&#xD;
he ever wrote so vulgar a book as "Don Quixote." She&#xD;
says that Byron's "Deserted Village "interests her sympa-&#xD;
thies exceedingly, although the majority of critics pro-&#xD;
nounce his "John, Gilpin" his master-piece. She has a&#xD;
perfect passion for Milton's "Tasso" and "Dante," and&#xD;
actually dotes on his "Lady of the Lake."&#xD;
Such being her acquirements, she, of ~course, is. very&#xD;
capable of discovering and appreciating literary qualifica-&#xD;
tion's in others. She delights in drawing ijiodest merit&#xD;
from obscurity, and in giving bashful genius a boost. It is&#xD;
through her instrumentality that Mr. Boors, the alarmed&#xD;
young man who sits in the corner staring so hard at&#xD;
vacancy, and Miss Quince, th~ young lady with a projecting&#xD;

* if it was the first time she had seen the work, have been&#xD;
introduced to the notice of the Timberville literati. These&#xD;
two . * *&#xD;
individuals are great admirers of Mrs. Bolt~11, who&#xD;
protests that Mr. Boors is a very intellectual young man,&#xD;
and that Miss Quince has a great deal ~of talent. Neither&#xD;
of them has as yet made any display of a1~iIity; for Mr.&#xD;
Boors invariably sits all the evening just as he is now,'&#xD;
and Miss Quince never speaks excepting in monosyllables.&#xD;
Probably&#xD;
they both, like the celebrated owl, keep up a&#xD;
tremendous thinking.&#xD;
The tall lady, with a very long neck and little waist, is&#xD;
Miss Carpenter, our cerulean sonnet writer.&#xD;
The pretty girl with a white rose in her hair, is Miss&#xD;
~Jarrol, the sweetest singer in Timberville. She is a belle,&#xD;
and a wit withal. There is a lawlessness about her which&#xD;
would hardly be tolerated in any one but a beauty and a&#xD;
belle. And yet I like the girl for her truthfulness. The&#xD;
would..be~digni~jed gentleman who sits beside her, is Mr.&#xD;
Griffin, her warmest admirer and most especial butt. lie&#xD;
a critic; a ~ery severe one, too. He is never satisfied&#xD;
with anything produced in the circle. Indeed, I believe&#xD;
there is but one composition in the world that he admires&#xD;
without qualification, and that is Poe's "Raven." Die&#xD;
never writes for us; but he is so~ very fastidious that, of&#xD;
course, we all think he can do wonders if he will but con-&#xD;
descend. And Miss Carrol is constantly teasing him to&#xD;
favor us with something ravenou8.&#xD;

celebrated individual whose voice, thundering through the&#xD;
columns of the "Thuberville Herald of Liberty and Free-&#xD;
man's Journal," makes monarchs tremble, thrones totter,&#xD;
and Old Hunkers shake in their shoes. His tall, thin&#xD;
neighbor occupies the chair editorial of the "Timberville&#xD;
Weekly Gazette and People's Advocate." (Our papers,,&#xD;
like our people, all have double names.) How delightful&#xD;
to see the urbanity with which they can meet. It seems&#xD;
hardly possible that they have just been tearing each other&#xD;
to pieces at such a terrible rate, "through the medium of~&#xD;
the press."&#xD;
The gentleman who is just entering the room, with' a&#xD;
'linen roundabout, and his pants tucked inside of his boots,&#xD;
is Mr. Bolton, the -worser half of our hostess, and a horse-&#xD;
dealer by profession. He couldn't spend time to change&#xD;
his dress; it was as much as he could do to come in at all.&#xD;
It is true that Mrs. iBolton, who is not very proud of her&#xD;
unintellectual spouse, has repeatedly assured him that there&#xD;
was. no necessity for his coming in this evening;' he needn't&#xD;
trouble himself, &amp;amp;e., &amp;amp;c. Still, Mr. Bolton, who is a&#xD;
kind-hearted man, thought he would just come in long&#xD;
enough to say how d'ye do, and let his neighbors know&#xD;
that he was glad to see them at his house. Poor Mrs.&#xD;
Bolton I she looks perfectly. constern-ed at his appearance.&#xD;
Her countenance says very plainly, "Won't he catch it&#xD;
for 'coming to the sawree. in such a fix! He' might, at&#xD;
least, have put on hi~ best clothes."~ But he seems wholly&#xD;
unconscious of her fiery glances, as he makes for a chair,&#xD;
and poising himself miraculously on one of its legs, begins&#xD;
to descant to 'Mr. Martin on the excellence of ~" them&#xD;

New lEngland, who, according to their account, is enor-.&#xD;

theme of their conversation. "Brother Peter's garden;"&#xD;

in short, everything at Brother Peter's is on so magnificent&#xD;
a scale, that "Carry" and "Lute" can neVer see any-&#xD;

but I d~ not, and I think that I have penetrated her char'.&#xD;

wish that such pride were contagious.&#xD;
The thin, peakedilooking woman, to whom Mary is talk-.&#xD;
*ing, is Mrs. Stokes. She is a very nice woman - as the&#xD;
Timbervililans say. She does not look as if she partook&#xD;
very largely of the good things which she knows how to&#xD;
prepare in such perfection, and with which she is always&#xD;
cramming her friends. As I before remarked, she makes&#xD;
no pretensions to literary merit hrself, but she isagreat&#xD;
admirer of it in others, and praises, indiscriminately, every-&#xD;
thing that is produced or read in the circle., She pro-&#xD;
nounces all the prose articles "first-rate," and all the&#xD;
poetry "sublime." Mrs. Bolton has not a very high&#xD;
opinion of Mrs. Stokes, but hopes that the "sawrees will&#xD;
be an advantage to her intellect."&#xD;
But my letter is already unreasonably long. If you are&#xD;
at all interested in our society, perhaps I may be able ~n&#xD;
my next to give you some specimens of our productions.-&#xD;
And I can scarcely entertain a doubt that you will hence-&#xD;

II.     /&#xD;
TIMBERITILLE.&#xD;
AM getting tired of boarding there are so many&#xD;
annoyances connected with it generally. And even&#xD;
in the best-regulated boarding~houses there is a lack&#xD;
of that pleasant hQme-feeling which One has in&#xD;
housekeeping, even though it be in a hired house. If we&#xD;
were determined, to "locate" (as the Timbervillians say)&#xD;
permanently in this place, we should have a home of our&#xD;
own. Until that point is decided, we shall remain with&#xD;
Mrs. Pratt, for I would rather endure a great many incon~&#xD;
veniences than to be changing about. I have often been&#xD;
amused at the frivolous causes which drive some persons&#xD;
from one boardinghouse to another. I know one gentle~&#xD;
man who' never stays above a month, and seldom as long&#xD;
as tha4 at the same house. At one place he had to drink&#xD;
milk in his tea; he hadn't been used to it, and wouldn't&#xD;
put up with it. At another, his nose was often offended&#xD;
at the odor of boiled cabbage; he didn't like cabbage, and&#xD;
he wouldn't stand it.'&#xD;
Mrs. Pratt's establishment is conducted on the most&#xD;
economical scale. She understands to perfection the art of&#xD;
making much of a little. She knows how to "stretch out,"&#xD;
and make a very small quantity "go a great ways."&#xD;
She5' is a widow of some years' standing, but has not yet&#xD;
ceased to grieve for her worthy husband. She 'is forever&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
expatiating Qfl his perfection. To hear her talk of him,&#xD;
you would suppose that all the virtues as~ well as talents&#xD;
that were ever created, were united in the person of" poor&#xD;
Mr. Pratt." The grand object of her life seems to be to&#xD;
marry off her two daughters, Ann Maria and Philura, a&#xD;
brace of young ladies who expend upon their fair persons&#xD;
the products of their mother's thrift, and who appear to'&#xD;
serve i~o other purpose in the establishment than that of&#xD;
entertaining the young gentlemen boarders. They ne'I~r&#xD;
make their appearance at breakfast,, but at dinner' they&#xD;
burst upon us in all their glory, looking as if they ,had&#xD;
spent the whole morning at the toilet. They are rather&#xD;
pretty girls, and with the exercise of a tolerable taste in&#xD;
dress, would look very well; but they are always arrayed&#xD;
in showy frocks, gaudy shes, flaring neck-ribbons, and,&#xD;
to crown all, some sort of trumpery headdresses, and all&#xD;
of different colors, so that it really makes my eyes ache to&#xD;
look at them. The head-dresses~, above all, are my espe-'&#xD;
cial abomination. I can scarcely keep my fingers off them,&#xD;
they make me so nervolls. But they are young ladies: to&#xD;
whom it would not be safe for a plain person like me to&#xD;
offer a suggestion on the subject of dress. They take but&#xD;
little notice of me, ~nd make no efforts to render my abode&#xD;
with them pleasant, but reserve all their attentions for ,the&#xD;
young men, who always find them "very ea~sy to~ get ac~&#xD;
quainted with." That part of their time which is not de-&#xD;
* voted ~to dressing, calling and shopping, is spent indrum-&#xD;
ming the piano, on which they do great execution, and in&#xD;
embroidering slippers or netting purses for the gentlemen.&#xD;
There are, at 'present, six single gentlemen boarding in.&#xD;

him comfortable, though he does aot appear to appreciate&#xD;
it; Mr Stivers and Mr. Gi~een, a couple of merchants'&#xD;
clerks, with nothing remarkable about them excepting&#xD;
standing collars so stiff that they cannot turn their heads&#xD;
without turning their bodies also; Mr. Hocum, a lumber-&#xD;
man, ~ho minds his own business and never says anything;&#xD;
Mr. Bunker, a sort of" Jack at all trades," a dealer in&#xD;
everything, an inventor of a great variety of useless articles,&#xD;
for, which he gets. patents he also fills the office of re-&#xD;
porter to the neighborhood, and brings home every day all&#xD;
the scaii'dal and gossip afloat in the village; and Monsieur&#xD;
Laborde, a French teacher, full of whims and oddities,&#xD;
such as rolling his hair in' papers over night to make them&#xD;
curl; exercising his lungs out of his window, to the great&#xD;
alarm of passers-by; cooking all sorts of ridiculous messes&#xD;
on the top of the parlor stove ~ wearing a great many&#xD;
brown paper soles in his slippers, and spreading them out&#xD;
on the rug every evening to dry, and a ~hundred other&#xD;
peculiarities.&#xD;
Besides the two daughters, Mrs. Pratt has also a son,&#xD;
a boy of some twelve years old, who, 'for want of proper&#xD;
training, had grown to be, when we first came here, a&#xD;
complete little nuisance., His sisters considered him a&#xD;
plague and a torment; and his mother declared, with a&#xD;
rueful shake of the head, that she didn't know what she&#xD;
should do with Joe, he had got to be so unmanageable&#xD;
no comfort to her at all, so different from what his poor&#xD;
father was. These lamentations, which were usually de-&#xD;
livered in the boy's presence, did not contribute materially&#xD;
to his improvement. In fact, he was universally di~iked.&#xD;
The boarders were unanimous in the opinion that he was&#xD;
&#xD;
destitute of one single redeeming quality. He played all&#xD;
sorts of tricks upon them, and they never passed him with-&#xD;
out a kick or an oath. Particularly obnoxious was he to&#xD;
Monsieur Laborde, who pronounced him "one leetle&#xD;
doable."&#xD;
When we came .to Mrs. Pratt's we heard so much about&#xD;
Joe's precocious wickedness that we almost feared to be&#xD;
under the same roof with hiri~. One morning, a few days&#xD;
after oUr arrival, as we were going through the hall to&#xD;
breakfast~ Monsieur rushed from his room just ahead of us,&#xD;
and with a ferocious aspect, hurried down the stairs. On&#xD;
his way, he encountered Nancy, the chambermaid, going&#xD;
up to "regulate."&#xD;
"Nancie," said he, showing her something in the palm&#xD;
of his hand, "what you call dis?"&#xD;
"That," said Nancy, who has a spice of the wag in her&#xD;
"oh, that's a pickaxe."&#xD;
"Peek-axe," said the Frenchman, throwing it down;&#xD;
and, as he proceeded, he kept repeating -" peek-axe,&#xD;
peek-axe," so as to impress it firmly upon his memory.&#xD;
When he reached the breakfast-room, where the rest of the&#xD;
boarders were assembled, and Mrs. Pratt, at the head of&#xD;
'the table, was just beginning to make the coffee, he bounced&#xD;
in, and without any of his usual French fuss, shouted&#xD;
"' Madame Pratt, I have' suffer one grand insult! Peek-&#xD;
axe! Sho have insult me in ma chamber. Peek-axe! It is&#xD;
one miserable shild, dat Sho."&#xD;
"The dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. Pratt, "what shall&#xD;
I do with that boy? He'll be the death of me yet. What&#xD;
huts he been doing now?"&#xD;
"He have insult me ver bad," continued Monsieur. "It&#xD;
is ~one leetle disable. V I could keel him, I would be sat-&#xD;

"That I should live ~to see the day!" groaned Mrs.&#xD;
Pratt. "Pray, what has he done, Mr. Laborde? I'll&#xD;

" What~ have he done?" said the Frenchman. "He&#xD;
have done plentie, te miserable he have trow more as&#xD;

While I shave ma barbe, I understand a noise by the&#xD;

"Picka*es!" exclaimed the distressed mother. "For-&#xD;
ever and ever! What would poor Mr. Pratt say?"&#xD;
" Pickaxes r" cried the gentlemen. "Impossible! It&#xD;
can't be so!"&#xD;
"Do you not believe that Isay?" demanded Monsieur,&#xD;
gesticulating violently. " Well; den, come to ma chain-&#xD;
bre, and you shall' see."&#xD;
So we all, ei~cepting Mrs. Pratt, whose feelings would&#xD;
not allow her to move, followed Monsieur to his room,&#xD;
where we found* Nancy, with a dust-pan and wing, busily&#xD;
engaged in brushing up a quantity of small shot, with which&#xD;
Joe had besieged the French fortress.&#xD;
"There," said ~p?&amp;amp;r1ez-vouz, "you can see for yourselve;&#xD;
* peek~axe, plentie peek-axe."&#xD;
The boarders raised a tremendous roar at Monsieur's ex-&#xD;
pense, in the midst of which Nanny made a rapid exit.&#xD;
The Frenchman was 'furiously angry at being laughed at,&#xD;
and fearing that something serious might come of it, I re~&#xD;
treated to my own quarters. II believe tiiat only two or&#xD;
three of the boarders returned to the tablet so that Mrs.&#xD;
Pratt saved a good part of the breakfast t~ warm up the&#xD;

Master Joe might begin to play off his pranks upon us.&#xD;
But I objected to removing, and begged him to leave me to*&#xD;
manage Joe. To tell the truth, I had a soi~t of sympathy&#xD;
for the child, to which, perhaps, certain recollections of&#xD;
my own juvenile experience contributed in some degree.&#xD;
Be that as it may, I felt a desire to know more of the tin-&#xD;
popular boy, an'd to discover, if possible, whether there&#xD;
was any good in him.&#xD;
A day or, two after this affair, at the tea-table, Mr.&#xD;
Bunker pulled out of his pocket a dirty piece of paper, on&#xD;
which was scratched, in charcoal, a profile considerably re&#xD;
sembling his own, which is distinguished by a very long&#xD;
nyse and huge whiskers; and holding it up before Mrs.&#xD;
Pratt, exclaimed -&#xD;
"Look o' there, ma'am! -that's Joe's work! I found&#xD;
it stuck up on my store, right in plain sight. If that boy&#xD;
ain't a fit subject for the Ji2ouse of Refuge, I don't know&#xD;
who is!"&#xD;
"Forever and ever!" cried Mrs. Pratt. "That I&#xD;
should live to hear of his d6ing such a thing! What' is&#xD;
that child a coming to, after all my faithfulness too! Why,&#xD;
I've wrestled in prayer for him hours together, and -a'most&#xD;
whipped the skin off his back, and all for nothing! * What&#xD;
would his poor father say?" &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
While Mrs. Pratt was groaning and lamenting, the work&#xD;
of art was handed round, and elicited various comments&#xD;
~from ~the beholders. The young ladies declared th~t, if&#xD;
they were Mi:. Bunkerf they wouldn't care a cent about it,&#xD;
for it didn't look a bit like him.&#xD;
"I don't care a cent about it," said Il3unker; "only I'd&#xD;
like to have the handling of that boy."&#xD;
Monsieur, who was still smarting under the pickaxes,&#xD;

pronounced it. a "grand insult." But the other1 young&#xD;
men,.~~always delighted at a chance to tease one another,&#xD;
thought it ~" a pretty fair likeness." "It's' I~unker," said&#xD;
Mr. Stivers; "only more so." "Pr&amp;amp;is6ment," said Mon..&#xD;
sieur, beginning to relish the joke, and glad of an opportu-&#xD;
nity to laugh at Bunker. "Pr~cis~ment - it is the nose of&#xD;
Mr~ Bunker a leetle more long,' and the whiskers of&#xD;
Mr. Bunker ~ leetle more big."&#xD;
Bunker looked as if he wished he had' not exhibited the&#xD;
likeness, since it had been the means of" getting the rig&#xD;
on him," as they call it here. But he was somewhat&#xD;
mnollifl~ed by Mrs~ Pratt's assurance that she should punish&#xD;
,Joe severely.&#xD;
*    In the evening, my ~'oom being very warm, I had thrown&#xD;
'open the door, and sat meditating upon Joe and his per-&#xD;
forrnances, when I heard Mrs. Pratt in the dining-room&#xD;
dealing with that young gentleman in a most summary&#xD;
manner; .scolding him at a terrible rate, and interspersing&#xD;
her lecture with frequent cuffs on the ears.&#xD;
"You miserable young onet" said she. "You'll be&#xD;
the 'death of me' yet,' I know you will- (cuff) you're&#xD;
all the time a doing something so ai~rful wicked (cuff.)&#xD;
What did you go and 'make Mr. Bunker's lik~ness.for,&#xD;
say?~'- (cuff.)&#xD;
"'Cause he misused me," said Joe. "He don't treat&#xD;
me like a huma~i being; and nobody else don't, neither."&#xD;
"Well, you don't act "like a human being," said hi~&#xD;
mother,. with another cuff; "and you ought not to be&#xD;
treated like one. Wbat did you want to draw that shame-'&#xD;
ful profile for say?" and she administered three succes-&#xD;
sive cuffs.&#xD;
"I tell you I did it because he misused me," said Joe.&#xD;
)  '&#xD;
&#xD;
"He knocked me off his store steps on to the&#xD;
gro~d,&#xD;
when I wasn't a doing anything."&#xD;
"Yes - I'll warrant you wasn't a doing anything,"&#xD;
said his mother; "you ain't ,never a doing anything, you&#xD;
good~for~nothing, lazy, idle little wretch! You'll never&#xD;
be nobody - you'll grow up a miserable vagabone! And&#xD;
what would your poor father. say if he knew how you was&#xD;
a breaking my heart every day ? - (Several cuffs.) So&#xD;
now, just take off your boots, and go 'long to bed; and if&#xD;
ever.1 hear of your drawing any more profiles, I'll give&#xD;
it to you about east!"&#xD;
The scolding and the cuffs alike seemed to make no&#xD;
impression upon Joe. flis ears were, doubtless, inured&#xD;
to both~ As he was passing my door on the way to his&#xD;
own. dormitory, I called him. He half paused, and was&#xD;
going on, when -I called him again. He stopped, looked&#xD;
furtively over his shoulder, and said -&#xD;
"I h~tin't done anything to you, have I?"&#xD;
Without noticing his question, '1 repeated, "Come here,&#xD;
Joe, I want to show you something." He hesitated a mo-&#xD;
ment, and then, reassured by my ~countenance, with a look&#xD;
of bewildered astonishment, advanced into the room. A&#xD;
new magazine, containing several fine engravings,, was&#xD;
lying by me on the table. I opened it. "Joe," said I,&#xD;
"I believe i~you are fond of pictures;. here are some good&#xD;
ones that I think 'you would like to look at." He came&#xD;
.forward and looked at the "plates;: but it was some ~time&#xD;
before I succeeded, by talking about the engravings and&#xD;
pointing out their nmerits, in makiimg him' feel at ease.- After&#xD;
he bad recovered from his surprise, he became quite inter-&#xD;
ested in the pictures,, rubbed off his dirty fingers on his still&#xD;
dirtier trousers, and began to turn over the leaves himself~&#xD;

"This book,'~ said he, "looks just like one that Mr.&#xD;
Green gave Philura; but the pictures are different. She&#xD;
wouldn't let me look 'at it, but I got bold of it once when&#xD;
they'd gone away, and looked at it ever so long, and she&#xD;
don't know it yet."&#xD;
"'Joe," said I, "you remind me of my nephew Johnny.&#xD;
You are just about his age and size. Johnny is very fond&#xD;
of pictures, and he draws them too. Do you ever draw&#xD;
pictures, Joe?"&#xD;
"Me!" said Joe. " No, not good ones; I don't know&#xD;
how."&#xD;
"Would you like to' learn to draw?" said I.&#xD;
"Gracious! I couldn't learn~" 'said he.&#xD;
"Why could you not learn?" I asked.&#xD;
"0 because) I can't 'learn anything, "replied the child,&#xD;
with a very decided look.&#xD;
Do you go to school?" I inquired.&#xD;
'~' Not now," said Joe. "I've been to school; but the&#xD;
master turned me out because, he said, I couldn't learn&#xD;
anything if he:should try to flog it into me till doomsday."&#xD;
"But would, you like to learn to draw if you could?"&#xD;
asked I.&#xD;
"Yes, I would most. plaguily," replied Joel. "I always&#xD;
thought I should like to."&#xD;
I knew the boy's capacity, from the " charcoal sketch"&#xD;
of' Bunker's head, which really possessed a good deal' oP&#xD;
character; quite' as much as 'the original solsaid---.&#xD;
"I think you could learn, Joe. If you have a mind to&#xD;
try, I will 'teach you."&#xD;
Th~ child looked up suddenly, and after reo'ardin&#xD;
moment with an expression of wonder, said, ~ *g me a&#xD;
"Are you in earnest, Mi's. Waters?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Certainly," said I. "I used to like, very much to&#xD;
teach Johnny, and I will be glad to teach you." I then&#xD;
took from a portfolio one of my drawings, and asked him&#xD;
if he would like .to draw that. It was a rough sketch of&#xD;
some children ~and a dog. Joe was delighted with it; and&#xD;
said he would give anything to know how to make such a&#xD;
'picture. 'I told him to come to my room every morning,&#xD;
'and I would give him lessons.&#xD;
"You will though?" said he. "0 how I wish I&#xD;
could come - but I darsent - mother'll whale me ~f I do.&#xD;
She says I sha'nt go into the boarders' rooms at all."&#xD;
"But if I invite you she'll not object, will she? ~"&#xD;
"I don't know," said Joe, shaking his head, sorrow-&#xD;
fully. "I guess she'd whale me anyhow; but no matter&#xD;
if she does - I'm used to whaling. "&#xD;
"0 no, Joe," said I; "if your mother were reall?'un-'&#xD;
willing, I would not have you come on any account. But&#xD;
I think, that if I ask her. permission to teach you, she will&#xD;
grant it. I shall g~ down presently and speak to her&#xD;
about it; and if she consents, yo.u m~y come in to-morrow&#xD;
rnol'ning at ten o'clock. And remember,~Joe, you must&#xD;
have very clean hands, so as not to soil the paper&#xD;
Johnny was always particular to wash his hands very cle~tu&#xD;
when he was going to draw. And now you may go to&#xD;
bed. Good-night, Joe."&#xD;
"Good-night, Mrs.' Waters," 'said Joe. " I hope&#xD;
mother'11 say I may come.&#xD;
After Joe had retired, I went down stairs and spoke to&#xD;
Mrs. Pratt. I told her that I thought' Joe had quite a~&#xD;
turn for drawing, and with her permission I would like to&#xD;
give him lessons.~ She was rather alarmed at first, and&#xD;
said that she wasn't 'in the habit of taking anything but&#xD;

pleasu&#xD;
umed quite, a different aspect in her eye, though her&#xD;
ter assre~ not for pay, that I wished to teach Joe, the mat-&#xD;
astonishment was evidently increased. She freely consen..&#xD;
ted, though she could not imagine what pleasure it would&#xD;
afford me to try to teach such a child as. Joe. She never&#xD;
could do anything with him. She was completely dis-&#xD;
couraged about him. It was the strangest thing in the&#xD;
wodd, too, that he wasn't a better boy, considering how&#xD;
faithful she'd been to him. Nobody could say he had been&#xD;
ruined by indulgence. Very true, nobody could.&#xD;
As I was returning to my room, I perceived the form of&#xD;
Joe emerging from a small passage at the end of.the hall,&#xD;
He was partially disrobed, (as the novels say), 'and hold..&#xD;
ing up his trowsers with both hands.&#xD;
"~Vhat did she say?" inquired he, eagerly.&#xD;
"She says that you may cpme," I replied.&#xD;
"Good!" shouted Joe, clapping his hands, quite for-&#xD;
getful of the office they were performing. "Good!&#xD;
* then she ,can't whale we.;. ~and when I cam get along with~&#xD;
out being whaled, I'd rather." -&#xD;
The next morning, at ten o'clock precisely, came Joe,&#xD;
with a pair of hands that fairly shone from the effects of&#xD;
the scouring which he had given them.&#xD;
." Good-morning, Joe," said 1;" I'm glad to see you&#xD;
punctual: a great deal depends upon punctuality."&#xD;
It was a rare thing for poor Joe* to be praised, and his&#xD;
eyes sparkled with pleasure. To shorten my narrative,&#xD;
Joe's progress in drawing was rapid beyond my anticipa-&#xD;
tions; never* was pupil more docile. Gradually,~ I added&#xD;
a few more branches, and~ he has entered with alacrity into&#xD;
* every study that I propQsed, though he seems to prefer&#xD;

ment of his worthy mother at my success. She wished&#xD;
that poor Mr. Pratp was alive to see it. The boarders too,&#xD;
when they had discovered that I had taken Joe under my&#xD;
patronage, ceased to abuse him, and he has consequently&#xD;
left off his amloying tricks. Even Monsieur allows that&#xD;
there is a "grand changement in Sho.' And I find the&#xD;
hour which I daily devote to him more than repaid by the&#xD;
affection of the hitherto neglected child for me - his first&#xD;
friend - the first one who 'taught l~im that he was neither&#xD;
a fool nor a wretch. In short, Mrs. Pratt begins to think&#xD;
that her faithfulness will he rewarded, her prayers will be&#xD;
answered, and that Joe will be something after all.&#xD;
Evening - Mary Willis has sent me this afternoon a&#xD;
little piece for our next literary circle. I am one of the&#xD;
appointed readers for the occasion, and Mary is too diffi-&#xD;
dent to read her own productions. Here is an extract&#xD;
from it:&#xD;
"I love to be alone - alone in the morning with* the&#xD;
trees, and the* flowers, and the birds. I am not alone&#xD;
then - they are all so friendly to me, and talk more&#xD;
l~indly with me than any human friend. The* waving&#xD;

faces pleasantly to greet me. And the sweet birds seem&#xD;
to be~singing soklyfor my pleasure.&#xD;
"I love to be alone* in the night -alone with the&#xD;

drous stars ~ how gently they look down on me. The&#xD;
clouds, too -they arefor me so many good and wonder..&#xD;

up in the place of one that had fallen quite to decay.&#xD;
One by one, the white-haired patriarchs of th&amp;amp;hamlet have&#xD;
been gathered to. their final rest, while those of their de-.&#xD;
scendants who have caught this age's restless spirit of&#xD;
adventure, have gone to "seek their fortunes" elsewhere.&#xD;
Only such remain as are content to pursue the tranquil&#xD;
tenor of their fathers' way. Heaven forbid that Green-.&#xD;
valley should ever " take a start and grow."&#xD;
Here, there is no such thing as doing anythingg quietly.&#xD;
The whole village must know all your proceedings; every-&#xD;
body must " have a hand in it;" and unless you receive&#xD;
with a good grace the proffered assistance, you are forever&#xD;
undone. I resolved to take warning from the unhappy&#xD;
fate of a certain Mrs. D., who came here to reside about&#xD;
*two years ago, and not render myself unpopular, as she&#xD;
had done. Unfortunate ivoman! She declined the offi-&#xD;
cious offers of the Timberville ladies, to help her "get to&#xD;
rio'hts,. and chose rather, with the assistance of the mern.&#xD;
bers of her own household, to fit her carpets herself, ar-&#xD;
range her furniture, and, what was the most aggravating.&#xD;
of all, to. unpack her trunks and bureaus, without so much&#xD;
as allowing any of the ~foresaid.ladies a peep at their con-&#xD;
tents. Mrs. 1~hil~ott, animadverting to me upon Mrs.&#xD;
D.'~ conduct, remarked, "We don't. 'know to this day&#xD;
what was in them boxes,'7&#xD;
Asi did not desire the repistatiQn, of being." stuck up,"&#xD;
I surrendered, with apparent' cheerfulness, my house and&#xD;
furniture to the mercy of some ten or dozen of the Tim-&#xD;
berville ladies, for the space of about a week. My hns-&#xD;
,band retreated in alarm from the scene of action, and&#xD;
remained quietly a~ Mrs. Pratt's, until the house was pro-&#xD;
pounced tQ be "to rights." Joe Pratt. said he thought it&#xD;
&#xD;
might with more propriety be called to wrongs; a very&#xD;
just remark of Joes; for actually we were occupied' a full&#xD;
week longer in undoing the greater part of what the ladies&#xD;
had done. Everything had to be re-arranged. The car-&#xD;
pets, which they had insisted upon making, had been&#xD;
sewed together in such a mnanmwr that the seams burst&#xD;
open and the bindings gave out during the process of'&#xD;
nailing down, which was accomplished so crookedly, that&#xD;
one would have imagined every person who assisted threat&#xD;
to have ~differed from. the rest in her opinion respecting the&#xD;
manner in which they ought to lie. Of course, they had&#xD;
all to be taken up,~ re-sewed, and put down straight.&#xD;
But, after the siege which the house had undei'gone, I&#xD;
thought I had reason to congratulate myself that the de-&#xD;
struction of property had been no greater than it was.&#xD;
When they unpacked the crockery, and I saw half-a-dozen&#xD;
pulling and hauling at it, I certainly expected to see it&#xD;
nearly all go to pieces. Consequently, I was thankful to&#xD;
escape with the loss of a few pieces of china, just enough&#xD;
to spoil a set, the demolition of a large lamp-shade, which&#xD;
Mrs. Harris had smashed in her eagerness to draw it from&#xD;
its concealment, and the ruination of a valuable framed en-&#xD;
graving, which Mrs. Bolton (our literati) accidentally&#xD;
dashed against the corner of the stove, thereby breaking&#xD;
the glass into numberless atoms, and bursting a hole&#xD;
through the middle of the picture. The good lady fancied&#xD;
that she made more than ample compensation by sending&#xD;
me the next day a daub of a painting a couple of&#xD;
women leading a donkey, and t~o or three hutsin the dis..&#xD;
tanc6. She accompanied this gift with a note, wherein&#xD;
she stated that the painting was ~one of a number which&#xD;
she had recently purchased in Philadelphia; it was "~&#xD;

*    Milligan,~ the great traveller whom she had iriet in the city,&#xD;
pronounced it to be a perfect representation.&#xD;
During the readjustment of affairs, my friend, Joe&#xD;
*   Pratt, was very useful to us. The little fellow was con-&#xD;
stantly, on hand, ready to assist in a thousand ways. We&#xD;
continued to take our meals at his mother's, until every-&#xD;
thing was arranged at our new abode. When, finally,&#xD;
that time arrived, and I ~aid, ".Well, Joe, I believe we&#xD;
are all fixed at last," the poor boy looked anything but&#xD;
pleased~ He would no longer have any excuse for run-&#xD;
ning back and forth. lie must ~tay all day at home, with&#xD;
no relief from his mother's fretfulness and his sisters' re-&#xD;
buffs. His daily visits to my. room, his lessons, and our&#xD;
pleasant rambles together, they must all&#xD;
Joe was sad.                        be given up, and&#xD;
"Joe," said II, reading his thoughts, "I shall miss you&#xD;
very much."&#xD;
"And I shall be so lonesome," said he, stretching his&#xD;
eyes open very wide, to prevent the tears from running&#xD;
out; "and mother talks of moving away to Ohio, too,&#xD;
and then I shall never see you again."&#xD;
The idea of parting with Joe was painful to me; for I&#xD;
had become greatly attached to him. A thought struck&#xD;
me of keeping him i~rith us. I, however, said nothing to&#xD;
Joe about it at that time, wi~hihg first to consult my hus-&#xD;
band on the subject. When Mr. Waters came in I men-&#xD;
tioned it to him; he approved the plan; and we accord-&#xD;
ingly proposed to Mrs. P~att, that, in case of her removing&#xD;
from Tixnberville, she should leave ~Joe with us for at .least&#xD;
a year or two. At first, the worthy woman did not ap-&#xD;
pear much inclined to~ accede to the proposal, and dwelt&#xD;
&#xD;
with great. emphasis upon the pain of parting with her&#xD;
only son. But as soon as she fairly understood that we.&#xD;
wished to relieve her from all expense on his account, her&#xD;
feelings underwent a modification; her objections van-&#xD;
ished, and she consented. And so it is settled. Mrs.&#xD;
Pratt is to remove to Ohio next month, accompanied by&#xD;
her daughters, and Joe is to come and live with us; an&#xD;
arrangement highly satisfactory to that young gentle-&#xD;
man.&#xD;
The greatest trouble which I have experienced thus far&#xD;
in housekeeping here, has arisen from the difficulty of&#xD;
procuring servants that are good for anything. During&#xD;
the first two months I had four different ones. Our first&#xD;
specimen in this ~line was a girl from the~ wilds of Penn-&#xD;
sylvania, whom Mrs. Stokes procured for me, and pro-&#xD;
nounced to be " excellent help." She rejoiced in the&#xD;
euphonious cognomen of "Rowena Ruggles." I had been.&#xD;
expecting her for several days, but she did not come until&#xD;
the second evening after we were settled in our new home.&#xD;
Her approach was announced by the rattling of a very noisy&#xD;
lumber wagon,' which stoppedNn- the middle of the road&#xD;
in fronp of our house~ I looked up and beheld an over-&#xD;
grown, raw-boned girl, accompanied by a gawky boy who&#xD;
* drove. The girl was seated on a huge pine box. She&#xD;
rose* up in the vehicle, and, after taking a comprehensive&#xD;
view of the house, exclaimed: "Wal, I guess this ere's&#xD;
the sittiwation. Jeems, I'll hold the horse,' while you git&#xD;
out and go see'f the Waterses lives here, if they do , you&#xD;
tell 'cm that Miss Ruggles has arriv'." Just then a boy,&#xD;
who was passing, gave them the desired information, and&#xD;
,the girl alighted and came in. She entered the front door&#xD;
without taking the slightest notice of the bell, and walked&#xD;

into the parlor where I was sitting. "How do ye do?"&#xD;
said she; then casting herself down on the sofa with na-&#xD;
tive ease and freedom of manlier, remarked: "This is&#xD;
Miss Waters, ain't it?" I assented. " Wal, I'm Miss&#xD;
iRuggles," said she, "the young lady you was suspecting. "&#xD;
After communicating this piece of intelligence, she took&#xD;
off her tawdry pink silk bonnet, and white gauze long&#xD;
shawl, and, laying them on the centre-table, inquired:&#xD;
"Hain't you no men folks round'? I guess Jeems'll want&#xD;
some resistance about fetching' in my chist." But she un&#xD;
derrated Jeems's abilities, for at that moment he came drag~.&#xD;
* ging up the steps the enormous pine box.&#xD;
Having, by this time, recovered in a measure from the&#xD;
astonishment into which the unceremonious entrance of Miss&#xD;
Ruggles had thrown me, I advanced and met the young&#xD;
gentleman in the ball, and, having directed him where&#xD;
to %estow his sister's box, returned to the parlor and re-&#xD;
quested Rowena to bring her bonnet and shawl, and I&#xD;
would show her where her room was. She complied;&#xD;
and,. on the way, inquired "whether we'd been to sup-&#xD;
per?" I answered in the affirmative; whereupon she in~.&#xD;
formed me. that she "hadn't had none; and Jeems would&#xD;
want some 'fore he went back with the surveyance." I&#xD;
got them supper, after which Jeems returned home; and,,&#xD;
after giving Rowena~ some instructions in. regard to her&#xD;
work; I retired with some misgivings, and left her to wash&#xD;
up the dishes.&#xD;
Upon further acquaintance with Miss IRuggles, I dis-.&#xD;
covered that she understood housework much better than I&#xD;
at first supposed. She could bake, and wash, and do&#xD;
plain cooking very w~l1; but her notions of equality, and&#xD;
her. utter ignorance of the proprieties of her station, ren-&#xD;
&#xD;
dered it very difficult to get on with her. She seemed to&#xD;
expect me to be in the kitchen at work as 'long as she was&#xD;
there, though in our little family there was not eh~iigh&#xD;
work to occupy nearly all of her own time. Every after-&#xD;
noon, she arrayed herself in a very stiffly starched petti-&#xD;
coat, and blue muslin dress, and "joined me in the parlor"&#xD;
(as novels say). Her dress, which fastened in the back,&#xD;
she could only hook a little way up, so she bawled out, as&#xD;
she entered, "Miss Waters,~ I'll get you to hook up my&#xD;
frock.". After I had performed this service for her, she&#xD;
was wont to complete her toilet before the parlor glass.&#xD;
After having adjusted a broad, yellow ribbon around her&#xD;
neck, put ona l)air of lace cuffs decorated with pink bows,&#xD;
and stuck an immense red and green plaid rosette in her&#xD;
mud-colored hair, she threw herself on 'the sofa; or, if I&#xD;
did not happen to be occupying it, in my large rocking-&#xD;
chair, and began to converse without restraint. She gen-&#xD;
erally entertained me with an account of the various&#xD;
"ways" of the various ladies with. whom she had. lived,&#xD;
occasionally diversified with remarks like the following:&#xD;
"I like the way you do up your hair, Miss Waters. I&#xD;
guess I'll git you to fix mine for me some time. I ain't&#xD;
no great hand to do . up hair myself. Sister Batsey -&#xD;
she's married a Brigham now, and live to the Flatts out&#xD;
here she's quite a hand to do up hair; hem's almost as&#xD;
black as your'n. That frock o' your'n looks jest like one&#xD;
Batsey's got; shouldn't wonder if 'twas off the same. piece.&#xD;
What did you hef to give a yard for that?"&#xD;
No matter what I was' doing, ~ reading, writing, what-&#xD;
ever might be my occupation, - it was no die4 upon Miss&#xD;
IRuggles's volubility. It, was a dreadful annoyance, and I&#xD;
resolved to get rid of it; but not liking to offend her by&#xD;

&#xD;
telling her that I would prefer her "room to her com-&#xD;
pany," I tried various expedients to induce her t~ spend&#xD;
the afternoon elsewhere. I offered her useful books to&#xD;
read in her own room; but she wasn'tt no hand for&#xD;
books." I discovered, on investigation, that she could&#xD;
bai~ely speii out a fe~ words, and had never learned to&#xD;
writeK~tall. I offered to teach her, and told her that I&#xD;
1i~       had a ~spare writing~desk, which she might keep in h~r&#xD;
room and practise every afternoon. But she declined,&#xD;
saying that "she didn't see no use o' much dedication;&#xD;
her brother Brigham was eddicated, and that answered for&#xD;
'em all." I asked if she had.no sewing that she v~'oiAd&#xD;
like to do, and hinted *that her room possessed great con-&#xD;
veniences. for such employment. But "she wasn't no&#xD;
hand to sew; sister Ba~tsey generally made her things for&#xD;
her." At length my patience was exhausted, when, on&#xD;
returning one evening with Mr. Waters from a walk, we&#xD;
found Rowena in the parlor, seated in 'my rocking..obair,.&#xD;
with her feet on an ottoman,' my Cologne bottle in her&#xD;
hand, and playing the hostess to Monsieur Laborde, Mr.&#xD;
Grimn, and Mr. Bunker, who had called upon us. The&#xD;
gentlemen had evidently been highly entertained with her&#xD;
easy manners and conversational powers. I was thor..&#xD;
roughly vexed, and told her emphatically to leave the room.&#xD;
her surprise was equalled only by her indignation. She&#xD;
went out in high dudgeon, slamming the dodr behind her,&#xD;
to the great amusement of the gentlemen. M. Laboido&#xD;
remarked that "Miss Roogle was very divertissante." Her&#xD;
proceedings were anything, but amusing to me, whatever&#xD;
they might have been to Monsieur and his companions.&#xD;
When Rowena retreated from the parlor, she went out,&#xD;
by way of compeiisation, to call upon Mrs. Crandal, the&#xD;

&#xD;
baker's wife, our next door neighbor, with whom she had&#xD;
struck up an intimacy, and to whom she carried a daily re-&#xD;
port of "Miss Waters's curus way~." No doubt she&#xD;
received that lady's sincerest sympathy in her affliction.,&#xD;
and probably acted upon her advice; for the next morn~&#xD;
ing, as Mr. Waters and I were sitting in the library, she&#xD;
came in abruptly and demanded her wages. It was&#xD;
Thursday. I had hitherto paid her on Saturdays.&#xD;
"Why do you want your money to-day, Rowena?"&#xD;
asked I.&#xD;
"Because I'm a goin' to go," said she, angrily.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Rowena?" said I. "Why ~tre&#xD;
you going off so suddenly?"&#xD;
"Pay her, Fanny, and let her go," said my husband,&#xD;
who is decidedly opposed to "having words" with ser-&#xD;
vants.&#xD;
I therefore went to a drawer and got the money for her.&#xD;
But Miss Ruggles was not disposed to depart without a&#xD;
few last words.&#xD;
"I'm a goin'," said she, causee you've made an un-&#xD;
derlin' of me ever sence I come here. . You ain't axed&#xD;
me to set down to the table and take a meal o' vittels with&#xD;

Having thus relieved her mind, she retired, ba~iging all'&#xD;
the doors, and knocking down several chairs in her exit.&#xD;
In the afternoon, Jeems came with the surveyance and took&#xD;

On the evening after Rowena left in disgust, Joe Pratt&#xD;
came ro~nd to see me, and he undertook 'to procure us&#xD;
another ~girl. He knew, he said, one Polly Baily, who&#xD;
had 'occasionally worked~ at his mother's when they had a&#xD;
great deal of company. He believed she was not very&#xD;
bright, but he~ knew her to be good-natured. She was&#xD;
now out of a place, and lived at a brother's. I thought I&#xD;
would at least make~ a trial of her. I therefore desired&#xD;
Joe to go and tell her to come-to me for a few days. He&#xD;
readily complied, and soon returned with the information&#xD;
that Polly would be over in the' morning. She would&#xD;
have come with. him, but ~he wanted to mend her things&#xD;
and make a new 9~lico apron that evening.&#xD;
The next morning, while I was preparing breakfast,&#xD;

&#xD;
Folly arrived. 'She came in at the 'back door, and hailed&#xD;
me with -&#xD;
" Good morning , Miss Waters. I s'pose that's you?"&#xD;
"' Yes," said ii; "and I suppose you are Folly Baily?"&#xD;
"'Tain't nobody else," said she, depositing a small&#xD;
bundle on the table' and taking off her bonnet, e~hibiting&#xD;
thereby a most unique coiffure. Her hair, which was very&#xD;
thin, was all drawn together at the summit of her head,&#xD;
tied with a tape string,: and twisted into a funny little pig-&#xD;
tail. In person, Miss Baily was short and stout, her eyes&#xD;
were set bias in her head, and her mouth was entirely on&#xD;
one side of her face. If she lacked the dignity and state-&#xD;
liness of her predecessor, Miss RuggJes, she fully equalled&#xD;
that young lady in ease and self-possession..&#xD;
"I should a come last night," continued she, "only&#xD;
my things needed mendin' and fixin', and I bad a new cal-&#xD;
jeer apron to make. You' see, sister-in-lIi~w's baby's ben&#xD;
sick, and I've had so much to do, I hadn't had a minnit's&#xD;
time to ~ew lately. But I didn't git at the apron last&#xD;
night, after all, for sister-in-law went to meeting , and the&#xD;
baby waked up and 'cried, 'and I had to tend it till she got&#xD;
back. So I fetcht my apron along: s'pose I shall git any&#xD;
time to make, it here?"&#xD;
"0, yes," replied I; "you will have some time to&#xD;
yourself every afternoon, unless something unusual hap-&#xD;
pens; and you wiU find a drawer in the table in your&#xD;
room, where y6u can keep your work."&#xD;
"Wal, if that ain't clever!" exclaimed Folly. "I&#xD;
shouldn't wonder if you was a goin' to be a real good&#xD;
woman to live with'; though Miss Crandal' says ~ -&#xD;
"It is nearly breakfast-time, Folly,"' I said; "there&#xD;
are some mutton steaks to be broiled: do you know how&#xD;
to do them?"&#xD;

"Pity if I don't," she answered. "It takes me to&#xD;
cook mutton steaks. Why, when I lived~ to Miss "-&#xD;
"Well,. ihere is 'the gridiron; the coffee is already boil-&#xD;
ing, and will soon be done. Do you understand making&#xD;
coffee?"&#xD;
"Pity if I don't! Why, I've made coffee ever sence I&#xD;
was so high. Jest tell me where things is, and I can go&#xD;
ahead, as you'll find out 'fore I've lived with ye long. I&#xD;
ain't afeard but what I shall suit ye; everybody that has&#xD;
me once wants me agin."&#xD;
So I ~gave her the iiecessary information, and telling her&#xD;
to ring the bell when breakfast was on the table, was going&#xD;
out, when she called to me&#xD;
"Miss Waters! I've heerd say how't you don't have&#xD;
your help eat to the table with you; is it so?"&#xD;
"Yes, Polly," said I; "I always allow my girls the&#xD;
privilege of eating by themselves; they feel so much more&#xD;
at liberty to eat*as much as they want, you know."&#xD;
now, ther is something in that," said Polly.&#xD;
"And don't you take off none o' the vittel8 after you git&#xD;
through?"&#xD;
Certainly not; the girls always have the same that&#xD;
Mr~ Waters and I have."&#xD;
*     "Wal,,I say for't; I~ don't see why that 'ain't ~ good&#xD;
idee. Miss Crandal needn't ~aw about it tis she ~es; for,&#xD;
after all, it's enough better'n the wa~r she in~nages. I&#xD;
lived there a spell Qnce, and I used to eat t6 the table with&#xD;
7&#xD;
em, and, it's a fact, I was half starved; for she used to&#xD;
be forever tellin' the children 'twa'n't perlite to take any-&#xD;
thing nior'n once, and so ye see I darsen't do it; and then,&#xD;
the mi nuit' ihey got through, she ketcht off the vittels and&#xD;
stuck 'em away under lock and key."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am glad you are satisfied with my arrangements,&#xD;
Polly," said I, escaping from the kitchen, and rejoicing~at&#xD;
having 'thus disposed of one grand difficulty.&#xD;
But that breakfast! The mutton steaks were burnt to&#xD;
a coal, and quite uneatable. And the coffee ! what could&#xD;
be the matter with it? At the first taste~ of it, Mr.&#xD;
Waters turned pale with consternation, and rushed to the&#xD;
door to "make restitution" 6f it (as M; Laborde say~).&#xD;
I took a sip, and was obliged to follow his example~ I&#xD;
never Listed anything so perfectly horrible. I called&#xD;
Polly, and asked her what she had done to the coffee.&#xD;
Why, nothing, " said she; "only, when I took it up,&#xD;
I throw'd in a tablespoonful o' salt to settle it."&#xD;
I went out and made a cup of tea, not daring to trust&#xD;
Polly to do it; and this, with the, bread, which was cut in&#xD;
pieces an inch' thick at one end, and slivered up as thin as&#xD;
a wafer at the other, constituted our breakfast. Mr.&#xD;
Waters thought it but a sorry begihnifig for our new func-&#xD;
tionary;' but I told him that these were evils which, with&#xD;
proper training, could, I hoped, soon be remedied. I&#xD;
spent the whole morning in instructing Polly, giving her&#xD;
the minutest directions about everything in her department&#xD;
of labor; in fact, doing* all that related to the prepara-&#xD;
tion of dinner myself7 in order to show her how I wished&#xD;
it done; while she kept *constantly asserting that "she&#xD;
lcnow'd she'd always been used to doing - but then&#xD;
everybody liked their own way~ best, ald she was per~.&#xD;
feetly willing' to. be teacht my ways, for she wanted to suit&#xD;
me," &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
After dinner' I was 'in the library., when Polly came&#xD;
bolting in, with a look of extreme satisfaction on her face,&#xD;
and holding in each hand a broken tumbler; the bottoms&#xD;
were gone.&#xD;

"Look' o' there, Miss Waters!" she said. "Ain't you&#xD;
astonished?"&#xD;
*' I am, indeed. How did you break those, Polly?"&#xD;
"0, law!" said she, "thiLt ain't it. I m~an, ain't you&#xD;
astonished to see me come and tell on't? 'Tain't every&#xD;
girl 'twould own up so when' they broke a thing; but Ido;&#xD;
you won't never ketch me a breaking' crockery anti then&#xD;
sticking' on't away, out o' yer sight. I'm honest, as you'll&#xD;
find out 'fore I've lived with ye lono'"&#xD;
*       On inquiry, I found that she had poured boiling water&#xD;
on the tumblers to wash them. I told her never to do so&#xD;
again; though, at the same time, I commended her hon-&#xD;
esty in' telling me of the accident. ~After she bad got the.&#xD;
kitchen "to rights," she came again.&#xD;
"Wal, Mi~s Waters, the worlCs all did up now; and&#xD;
i'm ready to go at that apron, if you'll lend me a needle&#xD;
and Some thread.; I didn't think to fetch none.~7&#xD;
I furnished her ~vith these requisites, and she retired. to&#xD;
her room. When it was nearly time for tea, she came&#xD;
running'in~ again, quite out of breath, exclaiming -~.&#xD;
"Don't ye think, Miss Waters, I ain't took a stitch in&#xD;
that apron lyet!"&#xD;
"Why, Polly," 'said I, "how comes that? I thought&#xD;
you had been sewing these two hours."&#xD;
"Wal., that was what I meant to do," replied Polly;&#xD;
"but, ye see, I hadn't more'n got seated by my winder,&#xD;
ready to go at ,it, whel\Miss Crandal she spied me from&#xD;
her parlor winder, and she called to me to come over there;&#xD;
s6 I throwd dawn my work, ye know, and went over to see&#xD;
what she wanted,~ and there I've ben ever sence; and Miss&#xD;
Capers and Miss Rennet was there a. visiting , you know.&#xD;
and they all three sot to and axed me n~ore'n forty.&#xD;
&#xD;
thousand questions about you, and all how I got along here,&#xD;
and what wages I got, and whether I eat to the table with&#xD;
you. I told 'em no; I had the privilege of eatin' by&#xD;
myself, without bein' watched every mou'ful I took, and I&#xD;
told 'em I had enough to eat, too; and a real nice room,&#xD;
besides, to sleep in, with a good clean bed, and a table,&#xD;
and a lookin'-glass in it. That made Miss Crandal feel&#xD;
rather shamed, I guess; fur when I lived them, I had to&#xD;
sleep up garret, in an old ~trundle-bed, you know, right&#xD;
where all the old truck was kept, you know," &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
My hopes of Polly's improvement were doomed to be&#xD;
disappointed; for I found it utterly impossible to impress&#xD;
anything upon her mind. She could not remember from&#xD;
one hour to the next, much less from one day to another.&#xD;
Daily and hourly did I go through with the same process&#xD;
of training and directing. Daily and hourly did Polly pro-&#xD;
test that "she would remember that time, I'd see 'f she&#xD;
wouldn't," and as constantly did she continue to make the&#xD;
very same blunders over and over again. She would act-.&#xD;
ually have salted the coffee again the second morning, if I&#xD;
had not discovered her intention in time to prevent such a'&#xD;
catastrophe. And the tumblers would have 'be~n broken&#xD;
every day, had I not superintended the dish-washing.&#xD;
The day after she came, the fastidious sisters Bigelow&#xD;
(Carry and Lute) called upon me. I had just gone up&#xD;
stairs to dress, having been engaged longer than usual with&#xD;
my household duties, by reason of Polly's awkwardness.&#xD;
My maid of all work answered the summons of the bell,&#xD;
and admitted the ladies with a very vociferous "Why,&#xD;
girls, how do you do? Come in.&#xD;

"0 yes; she's to hum," responded Polly; "she's jest&#xD;
went up stairs to put on her t'othex~ things. You step in&#xD;
the parlor; take some cheers; now take off yer things."&#xD;
The ladies declined. "What, can't ye stay? I know&#xD;
~4j~ Waters would like to hey you, and I'm sure 1 should."&#xD;
"Carry our names to Mrs. Waters," said Miss Bigelow,&#xD;
commandingly.&#xD;
"Your names!" said 'Polly, "less see, they're Canine&#xD;
and Lucy, ain't they?"&#xD;
"Tell her the Miss Bigelows are here," replied Cari'y,&#xD;
with 'a great accession of dignity to her tone and manner.&#xD;
Volly was puzzled; but, without asking further ques-&#xD;
tions, she tame to the foot of the stairs, which is close to&#xD;
the parlor door, and bawled out to me&#xD;
"Miss Waters! the Miss Bigl'ows is here. They told&#xD;
me to tell you their~ names I b'l'eve they're Carline and&#xD;
Lucy. They hadn't come to stay to tea; so you hurry and&#xD;
come down as quick as you kjn."&#xD;
'I was distracted! I rushed out half dressed, and, bend..&#xD;
ing oyerbthe banister&#xD;
"Polly," said I, "don't stay there any. I'll lie&#xD;
down in a moment."&#xD;
0 law," replied the pertinacious Polly, "I'd jest ,as&#xD;
lWes stay with 'em till you git ready as not."&#xD;
So she returned to the parlor, and entertained the ladies&#xD;
with an ~count *of the advantages of her new place; and I,&#xD;
knowing. that to call to her again would only prolong the&#xD;
ridiculous scene, finished dressing with all possible expedi..&#xD;
tiOD and hastened down, whereupon Polly withdrew, with-&#xD;
out waiting, to be sent, saying, "she guessed she'd go at&#xD;
that apron now." I apologized to the ladies for Polly's ig-&#xD;
norance, and said that I hoped .to be able to teach her&#xD;
&#xD;
something in the course of time. Miss Bigelow trusted&#xD;
that I would succeed in the attempt. Miss Lute remarked&#xD;
that such scenes were excessively annoying, and they both&#xD;
declared that the impertinence of the Timberville servants&#xD;
was quite intolerable to them, particularly after being~ at&#xD;
Brother Peter's, where the domestics were under such per-&#xD;
fect control, notwithstanding their number. They. then&#xD;
went' into a highly edifying description of the domestic&#xD;
economy of brother Peter's establishment, which occupied&#xD;
the remainder of the visit.&#xD;
After they. had gone, I spent an hour in teaching Polly&#xD;
her duty on such occasions. She promised faithfully to ob..&#xD;
serve, my directions. The next day, Judge Conway and&#xD;
Mrs. Conway called; and Polly, will you ~believe it?&#xD;
went through with the very same performance which she&#xD;
had enacted with the Bigelows! She was incorrigible, but&#xD;
so really desirous. to please me, that I was unwilling to&#xD;
give her up until I had taxed my ingenuity, to the' utmost&#xD;
to make something of her. But it was a fruitless task, she&#xD;
could not remember; unless I was with her all the time,&#xD;
everything went wrong. I kept her two weeks, and then&#xD;
gave up in despair. The poor girl felt very badly when I&#xD;
told her that I must discharge her. She said "she liked&#xD;
me better than anybody she had ever lived with; if I would&#xD;
only keep her, she would remember my ways and try to suit&#xD;
me." But I knew too well her utter incapacity~ to fulfil.&#xD;
this' promise 'to trust ~o her good intentions. One source&#xD;
of regret with Polly at leaving me, was, that "she hadn't&#xD;
finished 'that apron' yet, and she shouldn't have' a 'minute's&#xD;
time to sew at her sister-in-law~s.~~ You can ~therefore&#xD;
imagine her delight when I presented her a black silk apron,~&#xD;
ready made, and her ecstasy at the addition of a collar and&#xD;
pair '~of cuffs to this gift. ~.&#xD;

that of the two whom I bave tried since Polly's departure,&#xD;
the first was a thievish, intemperate Irish woman, whom I&#xD;
dismissed at the end of a week; and the last, a lazy, saucy&#xD;
black girl, of whozut you may form a correct idea by this&#xD;
remark of hers. She one day saw two of our most respec-&#xD;
table citizens taking a drunken, black rioter to jail.&#xD;
"Miss Waters," said she, "what you s'pose dem two&#xD;
white fellers is gwine to do wid dat colored gent?" This&#xD;
sable functionary eludeded to trabel,~' and accordingly set&#xD;
out a few weeks ago for Avon Springs. Since then I have&#xD;
been without a domestic, and, by dint of putting out the&#xD;
* washing, and having "old Sammy," an honest, faithful&#xD;
negro man, to come every morning and "do up the&#xD;
chores," I am getting on very well - nay, I enjoy it thor-&#xD;
oughly. In fact, Ii did not know, the extent of my own&#xD;
*   powers, until necessity forced the discovery upon me; and&#xD;
as every day strengthens my confidence in my own abilities,&#xD;
and my husband declares that he never was so happy in&#xD;
his life, I think I shall give myself no further trouble about&#xD;
"helps," as long as we reside at Timberville.&#xD;
&#xD;
x&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Crandal, having now no other means of espionage,&#xD;
has struck up a back-door acquaintance with me; and, I&#xD;
believe, begins to think me not so proud, after all, since I&#xD;
am willing to "take right hold and do" myself. She ac-&#xD;
tually brought in to me, yesterday, a present of some very&#xD;
nice "turnpike cakes," (did you ever hear of them&#xD;
before?) to raise bread with, and also gave me directions&#xD;
for using them, which I intend to put into practice next&#xD;
baking-day.&#xD;
But there comes Mary Willis. The dear girl's frequent&#xD;
and unceremonious visits constitute a great share of my&#xD;
enjoyment. I have but lately learned something of Mary's.&#xD;
early history. I intend to give it to you at some future&#xD;
time; perhaps in my next. M. W.&#xD;

'VE ben very lonesome ~at~ly. Jefferson's gone off&#xD;
to attend lecters, and I sha'n't see nothing' of him in&#xD;
several months; but one thing comforts me.: when&#xD;
he comes back, I guess it'll be for good. He's about&#xD;
made up his mind to settle down here, and everybody&#xD;
thinks he'll do well her&amp;amp; a doctorin'. There ain't but one&#xD;
person that's advised him to leave Scrabble Hill, and that's&#xD;
Samson Savage. He met Jeff one day when he was home&#xD;
last, and he says, to him in his patronizing' way, " Well,&#xD;
young man, they say you've nearly finished your studies.&#xD;
Where do you caldilate to locate?"&#xD;
"I've about concluded to stick out a shingle here," says&#xD;
Jeff.&#xD;
"What!" says Mr. Savage, says. he, "you surprise&#xD;
me! Why, you'd lieu a born fool to do that a born fool,&#xD;
take my word for it!"&#xD;
"Why?" says Jeff. "Don't you think I'll succeed&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
"As to that matter," says Mr. Savage, "I s'pose you'll&#xD;

be called Jeff to your dyin' day, if you stay here."&#xD;
"That is rather aggravatin'," says Jeff, "but X guess~ I&#xD;
must ~rin and bear it, and depend on posterity to do me&#xD;
justice."&#xD;
*" Hang posterity!" says Mr. Savage; "now's the&#xD;
present time."&#xD;
I'm very glad Jeff don't take a notion to go clear off&#xD;
to ~ahforny, or some other place away out of the land of&#xD;
the Jivin'; wouldd nigh about kill me if he should. The&#xD;
fact. i~, he'd ratherr be with his father and mother than&#xD;
anywhere else, and he's a genniwine comfort to us. Most&#xD;
folks think he'll get a good run of practice here after a&#xD;
spell. Dr. Pratt's gittin' old, and Dr. Tinkom ain't much&#xD;
anyhow; so Jeff stands a good chance to get along. I'm&#xD;
8orry for oni thing; the Fusticks are Put out with him.&#xD;
He's got a way of blurting' out, you know, a good deal like&#xD;
his father; he don't mean notbin' by it, but he made the&#xD;
F~sti~ks mad. I hope he'll do his best to mend the mat-&#xD;
ter when he comes back, for I can't bear that anybody&#xD;
should feel ~hard towards my son: I'd ruther they'd be mad&#xD;
at me. 'Twas a little time before Ann Eliza was married&#xD;
the last time Jeff was home.&#xD;
What! didn't you know Ann Eliza~d popped off?&#xD;
Well, she has; she s married a missionary, and gone away&#xD;
off to convert the heathen in the island of Mufiletegawny.&#xD;
I d~n't know as that's exactly the name, but it's ~as nigh as&#xD;
I can come to it, anyhow. Ain't it sing'lar that such a&#xD;
highty-tighty, ~6irtii~' thing should ketch a missionary?&#xD;
She ain't much like Mr. Parson's wife; she 'twas Urainy&#xD;
Slammerkin, old Slarninerkin's daughter. I know'd her;&#xD;
she was raised in Wiggletown, where I was brought up.&#xD;
&#xD;
* She was quite a religious, sober-minded young woman,&#xD;
Married Reuben Parsons, from Tuckertoivi', a good sort&#xD;
of a critter, but rather softy. They went on a mission to&#xD;
the- the what~domye~~Calb'ems. I never can remember&#xD;
names. Their letters used to be published in the G6syet&#xD;
Trumpet. 'Twas an awful hot country where, they went,&#xD;
and' the people was dreadful savages - didn't wear n~&#xD;
clothing . Some of "em went to Mr. Parson'8 ineetins,&#xD;
though' they couldn't understand a word he said.&#xD;
Well, the Wiggletown and Tuckertown ladies read the&#xD;
accounts in the Gospel Trumpet, and they was wonderfully&#xD;
scandalized to think the poor critters hadn't* nothing' to&#xD;
wear to meeting ; so they clubbed together, and made up a.&#xD;
great box of clothing , and sent over to 'em all sorts of -&#xD;
things, ever so many frocks, and petticoats~ and hoods,&#xD;
and pantaloofl5~ and so forth. The Parsonses distributed&#xD;
'em, and made the savages understand they was to wear&#xD;
'em to meeting . , So the next time Mr. Parsons preached,&#xD;
in come the barbarians rigged out in high snuff. The men&#xD;
was sweltering' under the hoods, with the sweat all streamin'&#xD;
down their faces, and the wimmin had thepantaloons round&#xD;
their necks, as if they'd been kiig shawls. The frocks and&#xD;
petticoats they fetcht along, and spread 'em out to sit ofl.&#xD;
After the Parsonses had been there about ten yeai~s, I&#xD;
~aw a notice in the Gospel Trumpet - I'd left Wiggletown&#xD;
then ~- sayin' that" the Reverend Reuben Parsons and his&#xD;
wife, our devoted missionaries to the the thingumb6bs,&#xD;
(I wish I could ever remember names) had left their&#xD;
fkld of labor,' and returned to this country, for the purpose&#xD;
of bringin' over their eight children, to leave 'em here. It&#xD;
was their intention to dispose of the. ,children .here and&#xD;
there, and then ret~irn to theiF interesting' portion of the&#xD;

about it. "1± can't be possible," says I, "that any&#xD;
mother would be willing' to give up her children in that&#xD;
way. I'd as soon tear out my eyes as do it." Well, I&#xD;
happened to meet Mr. Parsons and his wife when they&#xD;
was in this country. I was over, to Wio~ a visitin',&#xD;
and they came there to see their friends and bring a couple&#xD;
of their daughters to give away. Miss Major Coon took&#xD;
one she hadn't no children and Parson Potter's wife&#xD;
took t'other; she had nine of her own already. I says to&#xD;
Miss Parsons,,' 'Urainy," says I, " 'taint, true, is it, that'&#xD;
you to a gwine to lea'~re your children scattered 'round, and&#xD;
go back' to heathen lands ~"&#xD;
'.' Certingly," says she.&#xD;
"'Well, I'll give it up, now," says I: "I thought it&#xD;
must be a mistake. Why, what's your object in leavin'&#xD;
your children, if you must go back yourself?"&#xD;
"Oh,". says she, "I want to devote the hull of my&#xD;
time and -energies to the 'heathen."&#xD;
"Well," says 1, "I should think if you did your duty&#xD;
by them eight children, you couldn't 'a haj much time' to&#xD;
attend to the savages. See! you've ben there ten years;&#xD;
you. must 'a got 'em to a pretty high state of civilization by&#xD;
this' time, for I remember hearing , when you'd ben there&#xD;
only six months, that the wimmin had larnt what their&#xD;
'rights' was, and put on the pantaloons."&#xD;
Miss Parsons looked at me with the greatest astonishh.&#xD;
nient, and says she, "You don't seem to understand the&#xD;
'Bubject, Miss Magwire."&#xD;
"1 guess I don't," says I, "for I confess it's an onac~&#xD;

"I never regarded 'em as my own," says she; "I look&#xD;
upon 'em as 6uly lent to me by the Lord."&#xD;
"So much the worse, then," says I. ~" If they belong&#xD;
to the Lord, and He's .only lent 'em to you, of course&#xD;
you'd ought to be all the more careful of 'em, so's to be&#xD;
able to give a good account of your stewardship."&#xD;
"But you know," says she, "Scripter commands us to&#xD;
leave all and fuller the Lord."&#xD;
"Well," says I, "I never s'posed that meant we was&#xD;
to give away our children and go off to heathen lands,&#xD;
though I don't pretend to be much of a hand at interpreting'&#xD;
Son pter."&#xD;
"But you know," says she, "the great work of con-&#xD;
vertin' a world lyin in wickedness has got to be ~done.&#xD;
The Apostles was commanded to go preach the gospel to&#xD;
every cretur."&#xD;
"I know it," says I, "but the wimmin wa'n't corn-&#xD;

wives along. And them seventy that was sent out -&#xD;
s'posen they'd all had wives with 'em, how much good do&#xD;
you think they'd,'a done? And after a few years what if&#xD;
they'd 'a sent home eight times seventy children - granting&#xD;
they'd each had your number -.- the church to take&#xD;
care of? I guess they'd 'a had to found an orphan asylum&#xD;
to put 'em in.&#xD;
"Well," 'says she, "I can truly say that i1'in perfectly&#xD;
willing' and resigned to part with every one of my children,&#xD;
trustin' that the Lord will take care of 'em."&#xD;
"It's time enough to exercise resignation when the&#xD;

"I see," said she, "you don't understand the subject at&#xD;
all, Miss Magwire."&#xD;
"I guess I don't," says I.&#xD;
Whether Miss Parsons was mistaken or not, I know she&#xD;
meant to do~ right, for she was a' good woman, a good,&#xD;
pious woman, enough better than I be, though I wouldn't&#xD;
'a done as she did for all the world.&#xD;
But I was gwine to tell about Deacon Fustick's daughter&#xD;
gittin', married. I was surprised, and, I must say,&#xD;
amused, at the performances. her mother's a dreadful&#xD;
manuverin' woman, you know, always figuring' round to&#xD;
get beaux for her daughters, in an awful hurry to get 'em&#xD;
married off. Singular, ain't it, that, any mother can feel&#xD;
so? Why, when Nancy was married and left me, it eny&#xD;
most broke my heart, though she was only an adopted&#xD;
child. I didn't want .to oppose it, you know, for she got&#xD;
a very likely young man. But Miss Fustick don't seem&#xD;
to care much who nor what her~gir1s get, if she can only&#xD;
marry 'em' 'off. Amanda wa'n't but sixtee~i when she was&#xD;
married; her mother made the match entirely, and the&#xD;
man's a nuuiserable sti' ~. There's no tellin' the trials poor&#xD;
Amanda's underwent since she took him. But it didn't&#xD;
seem to 'be no warning' to Miss Fustick at all. She went on&#xD;
manuverin' and flourishin' round, pokin' her girls forward&#xD;
into the face and eyes of all the young men, till she suc-&#xD;
ceeded in getting' rid of 'em all but~ Ann Eliza, and she&#xD;
done her best for her too; but somehow she didn't seem to&#xD;
take. She's rather a pretty-lookin' girl, but she was so&#xD;
lazy, and so fond of dress, and so' eternally in the streets,&#xD;
laughin', 'and hollerin', and bawlin' at everybody she met,&#xD;

and doin' everythi~~ she could to attract attention, that she&#xD;
overshot the mark. Nobody didn't seem to take a fancy&#xD;
to her; the young men seemed willin? enough to beau her&#xD;
round, but they didn't want her for a wife. At length,&#xD;
her mother begun to get discouraged about her; so last&#xD;
fall she packed her off to spend the winter in Gambletown,&#xD;
where they've got' some rich elbow cousins.. The theologi-&#xD;
cal sirninary's located there, you know, and I s'pose she&#xD;
thought wouldd be a good place to. try her luck.&#xD;
She called to' our house one day in the winter, and told&#xD;
me she'd had such a gratifyi~'~letter from Ann Eliza, she&#xD;
wished she'd a thought to fetch it along with h~r and i~ead&#xD;
it to me. Ann Eliza had become so very much interested&#xD;
in the cause of foreign missions, and felt to regret that she&#xD;
hadn't hitherto entered more fully into her ma's views and&#xD;
feeling's on that subject. "You know," says Miss Fustick,&#xD;
"that's a cause that lies very near my heart."&#xD;
I was surprised enough to hear it of Ann Eliza; but I&#xD;
knowd there was something behind the' curtain, and waited&#xD;
patiently to see what 'twas. The next time I saw Miss&#xD;
Fustick she told me that Ann Eliza had got so exercised&#xD;
view of the dreadful condition 'of the heathen, especially&#xD;
the Muffletegawnys, that she'd mad~e up her mind to go&#xD;
on a mission to 'em~ if pa and ma was willing . "Of'&#xD;
course we esteem it a privilege to have her go," says Miss&#xD;
Fustick. Well, I was surprisder than ever; and couldn't&#xD;
help tellin' her so; but she didn't seem to consider it any-&#xD;
thin' strange at all. And it never once entered her head&#xD;
to think but what Ann Eliza was a very suitable person&#xD;
for such an undertaken".&#xD;
"Law nie 1" says I, "if she's in such distress to go on&#xD;
a mission,' send her up here to Puddenbag Lane; 'taint&#xD;

far off, and she couldn't desire to see a more heathenish set&#xD;
than the folks that live there; wouldd be a first-rate field&#xD;
of labor." Miss Fustick gin me one of her looks, and&#xD;
walked off without sayin' another word.&#xD;
A few weeks after that, Ann Eliza got, home, and then&#xD;
the mystery was all explained. She'd got a beau! a Mr.&#xD;
Simpson, 'a missionary to the Muffletiegawnys (I guess&#xD;
that's the name). He'd lost his wife about six months&#xD;
before, and come back to get another, and fetch his six&#xD;
children over to make this country a present of 'em. He&#xD;
wa~ dedicated at the Gambletown Siminary. So he&#xD;
went there to look round ,got acquainted with Ann Eliza.&#xD;
She was wonderfully interested in his accounts of Muffle-&#xD;
tegawny, and he was wonderfully interested in her. In&#xD;
short, they got engaged about a week after they first saw&#xD;
each other. He was to sail in a few weeks, and Ann&#xD;
Eliza came home to make preparations for leaving .&#xD;
I declare I couldn't help laughin'to see how bard she&#xD;
tried to look dignified and solemn. I called to see her a&#xD;
few days after she got home. Jeff went with me; he and&#xD;
she was old cronies; they'd had many a frolic together.&#xD;
She was wonderful stately to us, had her face drawd down&#xD;
about half a yard~long.&#xD;
"So, Ann Eliza," says Jeff, "it seems you're 0 PH&#xD;
for Muffletegawny!"&#xD;
"Yes," says she, with a doleful kind of' a look, "I'm&#xD;
about to enlist in the ca~ise of missions. Oh, Jefferson?&#xD;
how rejoiced I should be if you'd become a missionary!"&#xD;
"Should 1" says Jeff, say8 he, "do you think I could&#xD;
cut out Mr. Simpson?"&#xD;
Ann Eliza skewed the corners of her mouth and tried&#xD;
to look dignifider than ever, but she had hard work to&#xD;
make it out.&#xD;

"I've a notion to try," says Jeff, cockin' up his eye.&#xD;
"You hold on a spell and give me a chance,"&#xD;
Ann Eliza snicLered out, and says she, "Git along,&#xD;
Jeff Magwire! you make me laugh in spite of myself."&#xD;
The next'~day Deacon Peabody's wife come to our house&#xD;
and told me that the congregation was gwin to make up a&#xD;
box of clothing' for Ann Eliza, and said she s'posed I'd&#xD;
esteem it a privilege to contribbit my share towards it.&#xD;
Well, I didn't, view it as any great privilege to be sure,&#xD;
but I thought I'd ought to give soinethin', so I said I'd&#xD;
send a piece of bleached muslin. Miss Peabody said that&#xD;
Ann Eliza had received a good many presents, articles for&#xD;
housekeeping' and so forth, from her friends in Gamble-&#xD;
town, and she hoped there'd be enough contribbited in&#xD;
Scrabble Hill to make up her outfit. She said that the&#xD;
ladies that wished to avail themselves of the privilege of&#xD;
assistin' in this great object would meet at Deacon Fus-&#xD;

of course I .~ouldn't miss of comm', and I might fetch&#xD;
my contribution along. I told her I'd come if I. could.&#xD;
And she went home.&#xD;
I'd gin up attending' the sewin' society since Parson&#xD;
Tuttle was sent off, for I'd made up my mind~ there was&#xD;
more hurt than good come of 'em. I held a meeting' at&#xD;
home, alone by myself, went into a committee of the hull,&#xD;
and past a unanimous resolution of disgust at sewin' socie-&#xD;
ties in general, and the Scrabble Hill sewin' society in&#xD;
particular, a~etarmined never to attend it agin.&#xD;
But aft~ Miss Peabody went away I thought it over,&#xD;
and, concluded to go, for 'twan't a regular meeting' of the&#xD;

what would be done. So when Friday came, I takes 'my&#xD;

told Mr. Magwire to come after me in the evening , but he&#xD;
said he'd be hanged if he would.; so Jeff asked if he&#xD;
mightn't come. "You may if you'll promise to behave,"&#xD;
says I. "Of course P11 do that," says he.&#xD;
When I got there, I found quite a number of ladies&#xD;
collected, old and young. The old ones were knitting'&#xD;
stockin's for Mr. Simpson, and the young ones was makin'&#xD;
all sorts of things for Ann Eliza capes, collars, cuffs,&#xD;
and what not. The Skinners was working' a pair of foot-&#xD;
stools with woost~d. Liddy Ann Buill was makin' a&#xD;
fancy. head-dress. Polly Mariar Stiliman was embraw..&#xD;
derin' a morning' cap. Jo Gipson's wife and "Miss Brews-&#xD;
ter was sewin' lace on to a number of pocket~han'kerchers.&#xD;
Ann Mariar Lippincott was working' a pair of slippers for&#xD;
Mr~ Simpson. Gloriann Billins was makin' him a green&#xD;
velvet smokin'-cap, figuring' it all over with gilt cord.&#xD;
And Ann Eliza herself was working' him a pair of fancy&#xD;
suspenders. The Peabody girls was makin' a blue muslin&#xD;
sack. Miss Samson Savage wus there, too, picking' her&#xD;
teeth, and eiercisin' a general supervision over the rest,&#xD;
orderin' this one and commanding' that; as for sewin', she&#xD;
said they needn't expect her' to do any, for she'd eat such&#xD;
a hearty dinner she couldn't. ~liss Fustick and Miss&#xD;
Peabody ~had none over to ilarristown to buy Ann&#xD;
Elza's carpets, and engage a. dressmaker to come over&#xD;
and make her new dresses. She's got three very nice silk&#xD;
ones, and a number more, and there want no dressmaker&#xD;
in Scrabble Hill that ~vas fashionable enough to rig out a&#xD;
missionary's lady..&#xD;
~For a spell after I got there, I sot and looked with all&#xD;

&#xD;
me this ain't, much such an outfit as Miss Parsons had.&#xD;
How the times is altered! I guess they niean to astonish&#xD;
the natives. After a spell, Miss Samson Savage spoke&#xD;
up and says she -&#xD;
"Well, Miss Magwire, do~you want some work, or do&#xD;
you calculate to set and hold your hands all *he after-&#xD;
noon?"&#xD;
"No," says 1, "1 want to help if' there's anything I&#xD;
can do, but I aint no hand at fancy work. Ii fetcht along&#xD;
some muslin I thought would do for shirts and such;&#xD;
if there was some things out out of that, I could sew&#xD;
on 'em.~~&#xD;
So I went into the hail and brought it in. Ann Eliza&#xD;
got up and ~examined it, and said 'twas altogether too&#xD;
coarse for such purposes, but she guessed wouldd do for&#xD;
very common kitchen-chamber sheets. If I was a mind&#xD;
to, I might tear off some and make 'em. I was kind&#xD;
of hurt, for I'd took pains to pick out what I thought was&#xD;
a nice fine piece. But I didn't say nothing. I tore off&#xD;
the sheets and went to work at 'em; Margaret Pettibone&#xD;
took hold and helped me. She kept a-tradin' on my toe&#xD;
all the afternoon. IM~g's pretty keen; there's a good deal&#xD;
of the "white horse" in her; she's a good hearted-girl,&#xD;
too.&#xD;
Bymeby Miss Fustick and Miss 1?eabody got back.&#xD;
They was in high spirits, for they'd made some first-rate&#xD;
bargains in carpets and hearth-rugs. The merchant had&#xD;
throw'd off considerable when they told him the things&#xD;
was tQ go on a mission. "I says to him," says Miss&#xD;
Fustick, "that no doubt, under the circumstances, he'd&#xD;
esteem it a privilege to let us have 'em as low as possible.&#xD;
He said, 'Certingly,' and I think we got 'em very reason-&#xD;

He's a single, man; ben here since about the middle of&#xD;
winter. Capped Smalley, and a few more of the richest&#xD;
men in the congregation, after they'd got rid of Parson&#xD;
Tuttle, determined they'd have a single man; they come&#xD;
cheaper than mariAed ones, you know. Of'course all the&#xD;
wimmin that had daughters to peddle off, and all others&#xD;
that was willing' to dispose of themselves, fell in 'with the&#xD;
plan, and so they gin Mr. Pulsifer a call. He was&#xD;
preaching' in Punkin Hook on trial ~t the time, and accepted&#xD;
the call. He's wonderful popular with 'em ~dl, more so&#xD;
than any 'minister they've had before. He's quite a young&#xD;
man, and very good looking . He was brought up a few&#xD;
miles out of Boston, I forget the name of the place. They&#xD;
think he's terrible eloquent here, especially the young&#xD;
folks. But, for my part, I don't consider him nigh so&#xD;
deep a man as Parson Scrantum was; and in p'int of&#xD;
plain, practical sarmonizin' he doesn't come up to Parson&#xD;
Tuttle by ~ good deal. I try to make the best of him&#xD;
though.&#xD;
I always try to like' my minister, ibr. I do hate to hear&#xD;
folks, especially wimmin, forever finding" fault with their&#xD;
minister, complaining' about his' style, and' manner, or his&#xD;
want of this, and too much of that, saying they aint edi.-&#xD;
fled, and all that sort of stuff. II don't often see a minister&#xD;
that I can't lam something from, if I'm a mind tobe teach~&#xD;
able and take home to myself what they say. But, some-&#xD;
how, Mr. Pulsifer puzzles me. ii listen just as close as&#xD;
ever I can; I. give my hull attention to him when he's&#xD;
preaching , but I can't make head nor tail o~n't. His lan-&#xD;
guage is so kind of double-and-twisted, that I can't for the&#xD;
&#xD;
life of me make out what he's driving' at. He might as&#xD;
well preach in Dutch, for all the good it does me.&#xD;
Once in a while he has a sentence that sounds some like&#xD;
other folks, and I begin to feel encouraged, and hope he's&#xD;
a comm' down to the level of my comprehension. But&#xD;
the next minute he's away in the hyasticks ag'in, stringing&#xD;
it off 'about the "great All-soul of creation," and so on,&#xD;
and I give it up in despair. But I never say nothing about&#xD;
it, for I won't talk about my minister, nor discuss his qual-&#xD;
ities with nobody; 'taint right.&#xD;
It's amusing' to hear the remarks made about him by the&#xD;
young folks, especially the girls. "What a delightful&#xD;
preacher!" says one. " Did you ever bear such a ser-&#xD;
mon?" says another. ~' How animated!" says another.&#xD;
"I never could go to sleep under his preaching. " The&#xD;
Skinners come up aside of Jeff and me one Sunday as we&#xD;
was gwine home from meeting . "Don't you think Mr.&#xD;
Pulsifer treated the subject in a very original manner?"&#xD;
Says Almira.&#xD;
"Very!" says Jeff, "entirely original "-&#xD;
I hunched him, for I saw he was gwine to say something'&#xD;
he hadn't ought to.&#xD;
"Don'.t you think him very sublime?" Bays Sophrony.&#xD;
"Well ," says Jeff, "it's a great deal to. call a man&#xD;
sublime, but I think we may safely say our minister ain't&#xD;
but a step from it; for you know Burke says"&#xD;
I gin him another hunch, and so he stopt short; for I'd&#xD;
heard him quote that remark before. Jeff's quite inclined&#xD;
to make fun of Parson Pulsifer, but I never encourage him.&#xD;
When we got home, I told him never to, say nothing' dispar-&#xD;
agin' of his minister, and he promised he wouldn't.&#xD;
Mr. Pulsifer writes poetry, too, and the girls go into&#xD;

fits over it. To my mind, it's dreadful singular poetry. I&#xD;
never saw nothing' to beat it. Full of wrong-end-foremost&#xD;
words, and gqes hitchity-hitch along. Sounds to me like&#xD;
~awin' through a board full of rusty nails. Jeff says the&#xD;
inh~ister's got a high-.dutch muse, but. I tell him to hold his&#xD;
tongue. You'd laugh, 'though, to see what a time there is&#xD;
a-settin' caps at him. The young girls have all got tobe&#xD;
wonderful stiddy, go-to-meetin' characters since he came.&#xD;
They wouldn't miss the Wensday evening' letter for nothing .&#xD;
The Skinners think Polly Maria Stillman acts like a fool&#xD;
over Mr. Pulsifer; and Polly Mariar thinks the Skinners&#xD;
are desperit pious all of a sudden. Charity Grimes thinks&#xD;
Liddy Ann Buill's conduct is ridiculous for a person of her&#xD;
age; and Liddy Ann thinks Charity Grimes had better&#xD;
get a wig, if sbe wants to ketch Mr. Pulsifer. And so&#xD;
they 'have it, back and forth, all over town. I can't help&#xD;
hem' amused, and Jeff has lots of fun out on't.&#xD;
But I was tellin' about the meeting' at Deacon Fustick's.&#xD;
Well, in the evening' Miss Samson Savage said she wanted&#xD;
to see 'the rest ~of~ the presents that Ann Eliza'd received;&#xD;
~o Miss Fustick brought 'em out, and spread 'em on the&#xD;
table. Grammnany! it almost dazzled my eyes to look&#xD;
at 'em. There was a dozen silver forks, presented, by a&#xD;
rich lady in Gambletown; a splendid tea-pot from another;&#xD;
a lot of napkin-rings from some young ladies in that village&#xD;
Miss Fustick said that the Gambletown folks was deeply&#xD;
interested in the cause of missions; then there was a couple&#xD;
of elegant butter..knives from Miss Samson Savage she&#xD;
launches out once in a while, and does~ something' grand&#xD;
and quite a- number of articles 'for the table that I don't&#xD;
know the names nor the use of; and there was no end to&#xD;
the capes, and collars, and neck-ribbons, and flummydiddles&#xD;
'of all sorts 'that had been gin to her.&#xD;
&#xD;
I"&#xD;
&#xD;
While we was a-lookin' at the things, Jeff came in. He&#xD;
jest glanced at 'em, and then sot down by the stove and&#xD;
went to talking' with Deacon Fustick. I felt relieved1 for I&#xD;
was afraid he'd be makin' some of his speeches. There,&#xD;
was a number more young men come in, arid after a spell&#xD;
Mr. Pulsifer arriv. When he made his appearance, we&#xD;
all sot down, and there was a general time of puckerin'&#xD;
and primmin' among the girls. Almira Skinner draw'd&#xD;
her chair up to the table, and went to reading ' in a Bible&#xD;
that laid there, as if there wan't nobody in the room but&#xD;
herself. - The conversation turned on to the subject of&#xD;
missions before long, and Miss Fustick said she hoped&#xD;
Ann Eliza'd have grace to sustain her in her great under.&#xD;
takin'."&#xD;
"I hope so too, ma," says Ann Eliza. She sot twirling'&#xD;
a napkin-ring on her fingers.&#xD;
The deacon remarked that "'twas a gi'eat thing to gke&#xD;
up all for the sake of carrying' the Gospel to heathen lands&#xD;
- a very great thing."&#xD;
"It is, indeed," says Ann Eliza, glancing' at the butter-&#xD;
knives.&#xD;
Parson Pulsifer said something about " heart devotion&#xD;
and world~wide~influeflCe,' and then Charity Grimes begun&#xD;
to talk away about the duties and responsibilities of a mm -&#xD;
ister's wife, both at home and in foreign lands; she's got&#xD;
a long tongue. Miss Samson Savage winked at the Still-&#xD;
mans, and the Stillmans winked back agin. Liddy Ann&#xD;
]3uiil.was setting' beside me, and says she, "Did you ever!&#xD;
that's to let Mr. Pulsifer know how well she understands a&#xD;
minister's wife's duty."&#xD;
Polly Mariar Stiliman said she intended to propose to&#xD;
the ladies, at the next nieetin' of the sewin' society, to pay&#xD;

&#xD;
MISSION TO MUFFLIjJTECA IITNY.     361&#xD;
&#xD;
for the dedication of one of the Muffletegawny boys, to be&#xD;
named "' Jeremiah Pulsifer." Mr. Pulsifer bowed, and&#xD;
thanked her for the compliment. I couldn't help pityin'&#xD;
the poor little savage, whoever he might be, that had got&#xD;
to have such a name.&#xD;
Jeff spoke up, and says he, "I don't know much about&#xD;
these Muffletegawnys; desperate heathen, I s'po~e, though,&#xD;
ain't they, Ann Eliza?"&#xD;
"0 yes," says she, "they're victims of idolatry."&#xD;
"Poor lxmighted barbarians !" says Jeff, with a groan,&#xD;
"howlpity'emt"&#xD;
Miss Fustick was sitting' t'other side of Liddy Ann Buill,&#xD;
and she reached across, and hunched me, and says she,&#xD;
"Has Jefferson experienced religion?"&#xD;
"Not in particular," says I.&#xD;
"I didn't know but he had, from the way hespoke,"&#xD;
says she; "Thought perhaps tbey'd had a special effort in&#xD;
Coonville, and he'd ben brought in."&#xD;
"Hereafter," says Jeff, very solemnly, "I shall take a&#xD;
great interest in the Mufiletegawnys:'&#xD;
Miss Fustick reached accost agin, and says she, "De-&#xD;
pend on't, Miss Magwire, he's exercised in his mind, any-&#xD;
how. I shouldn't wonder if Ann Eliza's mission had set&#xD;
him a-thinkin'."&#xD;
Jeff groaned agin. "Poor critters!" says he; and he&#xD;
lookt at the wall and shook his head. You'd 'a thought&#xD;
his hull soul was wrapt up in the heathen. The young&#xD;
men stared and didn't say nothing ; Parson Pulsifer lookt&#xD;
surprised, and I confess I wondered myself what Jeff was'&#xD;
upto.&#xD;
"It's. a great work, Brother Pulsifer," says Deacon&#xD;
Fustick, "a great and glorious work, this mission to&#xD;
&#xD;
Mafiletegawny, and I feel to rejoice that a daughter of&#xD;
mine is about to take her life in her hand and go forth to&#xD;
engage in it."&#xD;
"Dear me 1" says I, "I don't see how you can bear&#xD;
the idea of martin' wiffi her to go so far off; like enough&#xD;
you neve~"ll see her agin."&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Magwire," says Deacon Fustick, "you&#xD;
haiu't got the right kind of feeling' about it; we'd ought to&#xD;
rejoice"&#xD;
Miss Fustick interrupted him, and says she: "For my&#xD;
part, if I had half a dozen daughters left, I should esteem&#xD;
it a privilege to have 'em all devoted to such a work."&#xD;
" Well," says I, "I can't feel so, nor I can't see how&#xD;
anybody can."&#xD;
"'Mother," says Jeff, very seriously, "you don't under-&#xD;
stand it all; you don't view it in the right light."&#xD;
"You're right, Jefferson," says Ann Eliza; "your&#xD;
ma's views are peculiar; I hope you'll convince her of her&#xD;
error."&#xD;
"I shall try," said Jeff, and, he gin another dreadful&#xD;
groan.&#xD;
Miss Fustick poked over to me agin, and says she,&#xD;
"Take my word' for't, Jeff's under consairn, and he'll&#xD;
come out before long."&#xD;
"Mother," ~says he, "jest consider the condition of the&#xD;
Muffletegawnys; think how deplorably ignorant they are.&#xD;
Why, they never saw nor heard of napkin-rings, butter-&#xD;
knives, silver forks, and so forth! and I don't s'pose they&#xD;
know a smoki~-cap from a stage~driver's jockey! Now,&#xD;
ain't it important that they should be taught the use of&#xD;
such articles as soon as possible, and learn how Christians&#xD;
live? It's a great work, mother, a very great work."&#xD;

362     AUNT ilIAC WJRE'S ACCOUNT OF THE&#xD;
For a spell after JeX had fveed his mind, there wasn't a&#xD;
word said by nobody. Deacon Fustick ham'd and haw'd,&#xD;
Miss Fustick, lookt perfectly stumpt, and Ann Eliza didn't&#xD;
seem to know what to make on't. Bymeby, Margaret&#xD;
Pettibone whispered to me, ~and says she, "I guess Jeff's&#xD;
come out rusher sooner than Miss Fustick expected."&#xD;
After a spell, Deacon Fustick requested Mr. Pulsifer to&#xD;
"address the ~throne of grace." Somehow I don't like to&#xD;
~hear that; it sounds too mach like sayin' "make an ora~&#xD;
tion to the Lord!" When the prayer was ended, we all&#xD;
went home.&#xD;
After Jeff and I got out of hearing , I scolded him&#xD;
soundly. "Jeff," said I, "I'm ashamed of you. How&#xD;
could you sarve me such a trick, after promising' not to cut&#xD;
up'?&#xD;
"0, no, mother dear," says he, "you're mistaken; I&#xD;
didn't' promise so. I said I'd bekave, and didn't I?"&#xD;
Ann Eliza was married a few weeks~ after. They had&#xD;
quite a wedding . Husband and I was invited, but Jeff&#xD;
ZVU~st't; and, on the hull, I was glad on't, for if he'd 'a&#xD;
ben there, like enough he'd 'a let out another link. Hus-.&#xD;
ban4 went with me; he was cur'us to see Mr. Simpson,&#xD;
and so was I. He was quite a spruce, good-lookin',&#xD;
youngerly man, with big whiskers and gold, spectacles.&#xD;
His riggin' throughout was all in the latest fashion. The&#xD;
girls all thought his manners was very polished, but there&#xD;
was rather more bow and scrap~ about him than I like;&#xD;
I'm old-fashioned, though.&#xD;
Parson Pulsifer married 'em, and I tell you' he did it&#xD;
high' snuff. After the cake was past round there was a&#xD;
great time about a ring that they pretended was in it, and&#xD;
the one that got it would be married next. Of course&#xD;

&#xD;
'twas all hurraw boys, and giggle and titter for the rest of&#xD;
the evening . But Ann Eliza sot still on the sofy, and&#xD;
lookt as interesting as she could. I didn't see her stir all&#xD;
the evening . A short time before we broke up, Miss Fus-&#xD;
tick went round and brought 'em to order, and we had&#xD;
several " addresses to the throne of grace." Deacon Fus-&#xD;
tick led, Deacon Parker and Deacon Peabody hollered,&#xD;
and Mr. Pulsifer closed. After that they sung "From&#xD;
Greenland's icy mountains," for a winding' up. Then we&#xD;
bid Ann Eliza good-by, and went home.&#xD;
They left the next day. There \vas quite a number of&#xD;
wagging loads of young folks went over to ilarristown with&#xD;
'em to see 'em take the cars. Jeff went too; he didn't&#xD;
lay it up not being invited to the wedding . Margaret Pet-&#xD;
tibone said that when Jeff went up to bid Ann Eliza good-..&#xD;
by, he gin her a good smack, and says he, "Now, Ann&#xD;
Eliza, if Mr. Simpson don't use you well, let me know,&#xD;
and I'll come over." Mr. Simpson didn't know who Jeff&#xD;
was, and he stared over his gold specs in perfect astonish-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Parson Pulsifer ~writ a piece of poetry on the occasion.&#xD;
'Twas printed in the Gospel Trumpet and copied into the&#xD;
Scrabble Hill' Luminary. I saved the paper that had it in.&#xD;
i'll get it, and you 'nay read it; read it out loud, and see&#xD;

hum with her from singin'-school and conference meeting'&#xD;
risin' tew year, and rm sure I don't know what the creetur&#xD;
means by putting' off so, for he's evidently very much be..&#xD;
smitten with her, and no wonder, for she's an uncommon&#xD;
interesting' young woman, looks very much as I did when I&#xD;
was a gearl; there ain't a feller in our place but what&#xD;
would be glad to git her. But she's evidently more pleased&#xD;
with Kier, than with ary other feller, and I wi~sh to&#xD;
gracious he'd suppose himself to her.) Well, the next day,&#xD;
we was all day a gittin' in a state of reddyation, and the&#xD;
Deacon he tell'd me to dew up his ruffled shirt, for he said,&#xD;
"seem' he was a guayne to eat dinner with the President,&#xD;
'twas recumbent upon him to look as slick as possible."&#xD;
"So," says I," yer a guayne to eat dinner with him, hay?"&#xD;
"Certingly," says he, "what else should I go to Utica&#xD;
for."&#xD;
Well, thinks me, if the Deacon wants to eat dinner with&#xD;
the creetur, he may, and I won't say nothing' agin it, tho' I&#xD;
druther be hanged than to go lqng with him, but I will&#xD;
neverstandin'.&#xD;
Well, the next morning' we all got reddy very airly.&#xD;
Zebidee he harnessed the hoses, and Amandy and me we&#xD;
habiliated ourselves as follcrs. She put on that are yalr&#xD;
figgerd silk gownd o' hem, and her black silk mankiller&#xD;
with white fringe round it, and her pink slurred bunnit&#xD;
with a master sight of artifishel roses and chany asters on't,&#xD;
and if she dident look purty it's no matter.. I put on my&#xD;
cinnamon cobrA canton crape, 'cause I ~cckon it's more&#xD;
becoming' to my figger than ary gownd I've got. Then I&#xD;
wore my red meryno shawl, and my green silk bunnit sur~&#xD;

G~O INC TO SEE THE PRESIDENT      373&#xD;
&#xD;
mounted by one long black ostridge fetber; and I must&#xD;
say I lookt uncommon well. But goody grievous! how&#xD;
Misdis Squire Jones did look! Missis Jones is a master&#xD;
nice woman and persessed of considerable intellectitude, but&#xD;
she haint no more taste in the arrangement of her attire&#xD;
thaii an old cow. But I can't spend time to describe her&#xD;
twilight.&#xD;
Well, Rier he cum in his one horse wagging, and&#xD;
Amandy got in with him, and the Deacon and me, and&#xD;
Zebidee, we got into our surveyance and purty soon all the&#xD;
rest of the folks cum nlong, and by seven o'clock the hull&#xD;
sivileade sot out. Well,, by ten o'clock we ariove to&#xD;
Whitestown and druv, up to Capting Clapp's ilotell, and&#xD;
arter takin' sum pie and cheese we sot out to go to the rail..&#xD;
road, the Deacon and - me and Zebidee fust, Squire Jones&#xD;
and lady next, Kier Simpson and Amandy next, and arter&#xD;
them the rest of the remainder of our townsfolk; and in&#xD;
that manner we plummenaded down to the railroad, and I&#xD;
sonny, I b'l'eve we extracted as much attention as the&#xD;
president himself. There was thousands and millions o'&#xD;
folks in the streets and they did stare at us con sairnedl~, at&#xD;
me pertickilerly, for I must say I was the most ~tinguished&#xD;
individual in our party in pint o' looks. I never was in sich&#xD;
a crowd in my born days.&#xD;
Me and Amandy and the Squire's wife, was the ony she.&#xD;
males to be seen. And arter a standing' there as much a~ an&#xD;
hour, and the President dident come, I says to the Deacon&#xD;
says I, "Deacon, dear, I feel kind o' timersonae about&#xD;
5t~ndin' here among sich a mess a' men folks."&#xD;
Well, I don't," says Missis Jones, "1 ain't afeard of&#xD;
their bitin' of me.7' (Missis Jones is awful bold.)&#xD;
'0 Kier," says Amandy, "I wish Ide a wore my vail,&#xD;
the men folks stare so."&#xD;
&#xD;
"0," says Kier, "that's 'cause they aiti't use to seem'&#xD;
sich honsotne faces." i' 0 lawful suz !" 'says Amandy says&#xD;
she, "yer a blaggardin' of me." Jest then the folks hol-.&#xD;
lerd out "the cars is cuminn'" and sure enough purty&#xD;
soon the injine cum a smoking' and buzzin' and clattering'&#xD;
along, and the Deacon amid ~ebidee they hosted me ont&amp;amp;~'&#xD;
the fence soJ could see over the folks.&#xD;
"Do ye see him?" says the Deacon.&#xD;
"No," says IL&#xD;
"Why," says he, "that are gentleman with gray riches&#xD;
on that they're jest a hystin' out 's him."&#xD;
"0," says II, "do ye mean that are short old feller,&#xD;
rather corputent, with gray and ~aller hair a sticking' out&#xD;
so consairnedly."&#xD;
"That's him," says he.&#xD;
"0 lawful sakes," says I, "-we might a seen enough&#xD;
better looking' men without cumin' so fur."&#xD;
"True," says .the Deacon, says he, "b~~t they wouldn't&#xD;
a ben all presidents."&#xD;
Jest that minnit there was a pusey man cuni puffin' and&#xD;
blowing , through the crowd, leading' a very franticc hoss, for&#xD;
the President to ride on; and a number o' men took hold&#xD;
and boosted Marting up. As soon as he was fairly sur-&#xD;
mounted, he spied. me, and he took of his hat and begun a&#xD;
bowin' to me at an all killing' rate. I no doubt he Was very&#xD;
much struck with my appearance, for it did seem as if he'd&#xD;
stare me thro'. Well, he kept a bowin' and I kept a cur-&#xD;
\chyin on the fence, till I begun to feel rather frustrated.&#xD;
"0 dear," says I, "1 feel terrible dashed to be stared&#xD;
at and bowed at so, Line a blushin' like all natur. Deacon&#xD;
dear, do take me, 6ff this ere pre-eminence.&#xD;
"0 lawful suz," says Missis Jones, "I wouldn't be&#xD;
afeard a' the face o' Clay."&#xD;
&#xD;

GOING TO SEE THE PRESIDENT.    375&#xD;
&#xD;
"Nor me nyther," says I, "for I don't bleve Clay's&#xD;
got sich plagy sharp eyes as Van Buren has."&#xD;
Well we went back to the tavern to reassume our&#xD;
waggins and perceed to Utica. It had bid thir to be rainy&#xD;
all day and jest as we got to the eating's, it clouded up&#xD;
wuss than ever, and lookt as if wouldd pour every minnit,&#xD;
and Missis Jones~ said for her part she want a guayne a&#xD;
step furder, she'd no notio~ o' gittin' as wet as muck&#xD;
for all the presidents betwext here and Passarnaquoddy&#xD;
Bay.&#xD;
"Me nyther," says Amandy Malviny, "I aint so&#xD;
anxious to ride behind the President as to spile my bunnit&#xD;
for't."&#xD;
"Well," says I, "I aint no frind o' Van Buren. My&#xD;
fust husband was a stain, uncountermisin whig, and he&#xD;
always, endeevord to distill his sentiments into me, but&#xD;
neverstandin' that, line a guayne to Utica, and it's jest to&#xD;
gratificate my dear husband the Deacon. I aint afeard of&#xD;
a little rain. line nyther sugar nor salt, and line a&#xD;
guaype to Utica, I don't ker if the Dragon stands in the&#xD;
doQr.'~                                       /&#xD;
"That's you, wife," says the Degeon, squeezing' my hand.&#xD;
* So he and me and Zebidee, we got in our wagging and rid&#xD;
off, leaving' Missis Jones and Amandy' and Kier to the&#xD;
Casting's, where they said they meant to stay till the&#xD;
shower was over.&#xD;
We had to drive ainazin' tight to ketch up with the&#xD;
republican rottenow, but at last we got tew 'em and druv&#xD;
into the citty at the hindmost eend of 'em. Instid o'&#xD;
stopping' at the botch, Van Buren went hum to eat dinner&#xD;
with the gentleman that brung up the hoss for him, and&#xD;
I heerd (tho' I didn't see it) that when he rid up to the&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
door, there was a couple o' very genteel young wimmen&#xD;
cum out o' the house and carried him in on a lady's dicer.&#xD;
"Well," says the Deacon, says he, "1 aint a cummin'&#xD;
clear to Utica to eat dinner with the ~President, and then&#xD;
be cheated out on't,"~ so we left our surveyance to the&#xD;
tavernand the Deacon and me and Zebidee, we walkt&#xD;
over to the man's house. Well we knock to the door,&#xD;
and nobody didn't cum, so Zeb he gin a thundering' kick&#xD;
and then there was a nigger wench cum.&#xD;
"Is the President here?" says the deacon.&#xD;
Yis, sir," says she.&#xD;
"Well then, show us into yer settin'-room, we've cum&#xD;
to dinner." The nigger stared and didn't offer to stir.&#xD;
"Don't ye hear, you black creetur," says I, "show us&#xD;
into yer settin'-rOoIfl."&#xD;
So she opened a door and ushered us into a terrible&#xD;
nice room. "Now," says I, "go tell yer Missis to set&#xD;
three more additional plates to the table." So she went&#xD;
off and purty soon the man that fetcht the boss up to&#xD;
Whitestown, he cuin in mighty fierce with a wonderful&#xD;
genteel looking' woman behind him.&#xD;
'~What's the meaning' o' this?" says the man.&#xD;
"Why, we've curn to eat dinner with the President,"&#xD;
says the Deacon, says he.&#xD;
"Have hay," says he. "Well, Ile tell ye another&#xD;
story. My house aint a tarvern."&#xD;
The Deacon he was bethunderstruck and darsent say&#xD;
another word. So I up, and says I, "Mister, I gess if&#xD;
you knowd who you was a-talkin' tew, you'd be rather&#xD;
perhiter; this ere's Deacon Gorum; and he's not ony&#xD;
deacon, but supervisor to boot, and line his pardner, and&#xD;
this ere's our son, and ~we've cum better iirteen mild a&#xD;
purpose to eat dinner with the President."&#xD;
&#xD;

376      GO~NC TO SEE TILE PRESIDENT,&#xD;
&#xD;
C OINC TO SEE THE PRESIDENT.    377&#xD;
&#xD;
"Have hay," says he. "Well line sorry to say we&#xD;
can't accommerdate ye. My wife haint cookt more'n&#xD;
enough dinner for she and I and the President, and Mr.&#xD;
and Missis Boneset, have ye, my dear?" says he, turning'&#xD;
to his wife. (She stood there with her honkercher up to&#xD;
her f1~ce a'.gigglin'.y&#xD;
"My! flQ~'~ says she, "and line fearful we shall cum&#xD;
short as it is, if Mr. and Missis Boneset is very hearty to&#xD;
eat."&#xD;
"Whose Mr. ~nd Missis Boneset?" says L&#xD;
"Lawful sakes!," says she. "Don't ye know, why&#xD;
it's the Secretary and Secretaryess of War."&#xD;
"There, Deacon," says I, didn'tt 1 tell ye there'd be&#xD;
war? Now I reckon the sooner we git hum the better."&#xD;
Jest then I happened t9 spy Van Buren a peeking' thro' a&#xD;
crack in the door, so thinks me, lie giv him a stirrin' up,&#xD;
"so," says I, castin' a look of suvering contempt at the&#xD;
man and his wife, " Ye may go to the Dragon with yer&#xD;
dinner. I don't want nun on't. I aint no Vanburenite,&#xD;
and my fust husband wouldn't a wiped his old shoes on&#xD;
Martin. He was 'as stiff a whig as ever trod shoe&#xD;
leather, and so be I and so was the Deacon, till Satan&#xD;
tempted him to go over to t'other side. I s'pose the evil&#xD;
one reckoned they needed one decent man among 'em."&#xD;
"Git out o' my house," says the man.&#xD;
"Withall the pleasure on airth," says I, aaakin' an all&#xD;
sufficient low kurchy, 'and walking' c~ff with Oncoinmon dig-&#xD;
nitude, the Deacon an4 Zebidee follerin'. Well, it was a&#xD;
raining~ considerable smart, so we went as fast as we could&#xD;
to where we left our wagging, and got in and rid over to&#xD;
Elihu Slocum's (he's an intimit frind o' the Deacon's,&#xD;
moved from our place ~ve years ago; his wife's a very&#xD;
&#xD;
genteel woman). Well, we went there, and, they was ter-&#xD;
rible glad to see us; got dinner for us, and treated us&#xD;
very perlite. But the Deacon was dretfuL sober - he felt&#xD;
awful cheap about ~bein' used so by that democrat and&#xD;
his wife. But he didn't say nothing' about it afore Mr.&#xD;
Slocum, and he winked to 'me not tew, 'cause Slocums a&#xD;
whig, and the Deacon know'd he'd bother him to everlastin&#xD;
about it if he heerd on't. Well, arter dinner Zeb he&#xD;
went out, and purty soon he cum back, and says he,&#xD;
"Father, the President's down to the hotel a shaking' hands&#xD;
with his finds, don't ye want to go down and see him?"&#xD;
So the I)eacon he said he'd go, and he axt Mr~Slocum&#xD;
to go~ Slocum said he wouldn't give a. darn to shake&#xD;
hands with the President, but seem 'twas the Deacon axt&#xD;
him he'd go.' So they went, and byrne by they cum&#xD;
back, and the Deacon lookt considerable chirker'n he did&#xD;
afore h~ went; and thinks me, I wonder what's the reason.&#xD;
Well, it ~Iackt up rainin', and arter urgin' Missis Slocum&#xD;
to cum and see us, we started for hum. And arter we&#xD;
was in the wagging and fairly agoin, the Deacon he says to&#xD;
me, says he, "Well, if I didn't eat dinner with the Presi-&#xD;
dent, I've had an uncommon perlite reception f~pm him.&#xD;
We went into the hotel, and purty soon we war intro-&#xD;
ducted. As soon as the President heerd my name, he&#xD;
says, says he,&#xD;
"'Ah, Deacon Gorharn, I'm delighted to see you ; ,set&#xD;
down here a minnit.' So I sot down, and he whispered&#xD;
to me, and says he, 'Deacon, that was a scurvy trick they&#xD;
sairved ye at my friend's down here. I hope ye don't think&#xD;
Ii had any hand in it. Rea~y, when I peeked into the&#xD;
door and see how they used ye, and reflected that sittyated&#xD;
as I 'Was, it was unproper for me to interfere, my suffering&#xD;

was intolerable. You must cum to Washington next&#xD;
winter and eat dinner with me at my own table, and bring&#xD;
yer wife. fly the way, she's a~ splendid woman, I was&#xD;
very much struck with her appearance; and that son.o'&#xD;
yourn, smart feller that, he'll make a man one o' these~&#xD;
days, and no mistake. Sorry I can't convairse a spell&#xD;
longer with ye, but I've said more to you than I ha~ve to&#xD;
ary one individdyal to-day. Good-by, Deacon,' 'Good-&#xD;
by, President,' says I; then we shook hands agin, and I&#xD;
cum off." Well, we went home, and I tell ye, the Deacon&#xD;
never told nobody about tryin' to eat dinner with the Pres-&#xD;
ident, b~t he's told rnore'n a hundred times how h&amp;amp; had a&#xD;
long conversation with him, and what he &amp;amp;~iJ about me&#xD;
and Zebidee. For my part, line a whig, my first hus-&#xD;
band was a thoro' guayne whig, and I don't think I shall&#xD;
ever be anything else; ~butarter all .taint in natur for me&#xD;
to feel so hard agin the President sence what he said about&#xD;
m~, as I did afore; and I haint made up my mind yit&#xD;
whether I shall oppose the Deacon's votin' for him next&#xD;
election or not.&#xD;
