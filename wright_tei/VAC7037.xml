CHAPTER I. HOUSE HUNTING. WE Inoved on the 1st of May, 1862. On that pivot hung my destiny. Otherwise my crazy bark might never have drifted upon the sea of letters. On one of the last days of April, prior to that date a little more than a twelve- month, Leonardus had donned a spick- span-new suit of army gray, shouldered his rifle and gone to the wars. During the summer that followed I consoled myself in manuflacturing have- locks and attending soldiers' aid societies; but when the dark, cold, long-to-be-re- membered winter sprang upon mo I found no choice of occupations, but was com- pelled to turn all my energies into the effort to keep the temperature in our elegant White stone palace on the avenue above freezing-point. A growing distaste for frescoed walls, high ceilings, and plate glass, culminated one day, while the mer- cury was fifteen degrees below zero, and a northeast gale blowing almost as hard within doors as witlout, by my wrapping myself up and setting out on a house- hunting expedition.   A few blocks above us stood a queer, old-filshioned cottage, whose geography was not wrlitten upon the faco of it. It was in the centre of eight or ten full- sized city lots, shaded by some largo leafy trees, and by the pretentious edifices of the Garden City of the West. I can hardly account for the subtle influence which induced Ime to turn my head in passing, but a great staring poster-To "ET--upon the fiont-door caused me to lusl wide open the rickety gate, and pick my way up the icy walk, which was being swept clean of snow by the fitfll gusts. I gave the bell a slippery jerk, and the handle separated from its wire and adhered fast to my glove. It had done its work, however, for a little, sallow- faced woman came to the door, and, in answer to my apologies and inquiries, took me through the house. It was snug and homelike. I was struck particularly by the noticeable absence of the so-called modern improvements. "No furnace!-no speaking-tubes -- no dumb-waiters! How pleasant!"I remarked to the woman. She looked at me in astonishment, and I explained.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7037-00000005"/> "I havie had a surfeit of those things, and choose to dispense with them alto- gether. I seek now for personal com- fort. Can the house be made warm with stoves and grates?" "Oh, yes, if you don't mind buying a large quantity of coal. It takes seven- teen tons for the season, or somewhere about that quantity." "Seventeen tons only Why, I shall not burn a coal-hod less than thirty-five tons where I am now, and I have not been free from a shiver since the 1st of November. I'll take the house." "You have not seen it all yet." "It don't matter as long as I am sat- isfied." I went directly home, and wrote a note to the real-estate agents who had the property in charge, which resulted, a week or so later, in my signing a lease, and congratulating myself upon the ease I had acquired in the transaction of business. Among other things, I negotiated for a series of repairs, and, as the spring ad- vanced, workmen were to bo seen as thick as bees on the premises. I stepped in once or twice to learn progress, and was informed by the "boss" that the place would be ready for me at least a week before moving-day. Thus I rested. Some friends from Albany paid me an unexpected visit about that time. I was desirous of showing them every possible attention, as they had never been West before, and consequently took them to see all the lions, from the top of the court-house to the Artesian well, and de- voted our evenings to a round of enter- tainments. They left on an Eastern- bound train at ten o'clock the night be- fore the 1st of May.   As I was pulling out my hair-pins preparatory to retiring to rest, I gave my first serious attention to the moving of to-morrow-a new experience for me; and ignorance was unquestionably bliss. "It will be no great affair," I soliloquized. "Handy, good-natured draymen will do the work. They will wheel out sofas, chairs, tables, beds, etc., put them on large carts, pull up carpets and; pile on the top, lay pictures anywhere on soft places, tie books up in blankets, pack clothes in trunks and bureau drawers, and tuck clocks, vases, and ornaments in waste corners-"I was in bed by the time I got to corners, and fell asleep, and dreamed I was moving by telegraph, and that my silver tea-set and a half a dozen lounges were galloping along astride the wires. I was waked by the bursting into the room of my sixteen-year-old sister Spicy, with a little scream of surprise at my tardiness. "What, not up! Why, it has been broad daylight for an hour My trunk is packed; I've taken the curtains down in my room, and made a bag for the cat." Just then the breakfast-bell rang. "Go down, please, and pour the cof- fee, and say I will be there presently," I remarked, hurrying at my toilet. "Who shall I address, since there is not a soul but you and I to sit at the first t table?" "Surely, we are alone again. But you may tell Myra to be getting things ready in the kitchen, and Maggie, instead * of stopping to wait on the table, had bet- * ter go for the wagons." "And that other person-have you io orders for her?"   "No. Her head is worth a dozen of mine in an emergency. I shall be more likely to go to her before the day is over for directions. But what makes you per- sist in calling her that other person? Why don't you say Nursy Brown, as I do?" "Because Brown is such a common name, and she seems such an uncommon person. There it is again I Person must be the word. I can't say woman, be- cause that would sound so much older than she really is. I can't say girl, for that, I think, would sound as much too young, and not apply at all; and of course she isn't a lady, or she wouldn't be out at service. By the way, where did you pick her up?" "She called here one rainy morning, almost a year ago, and applied for tie situation. I had been wishing to make a change for some time, but had post- poned the evil day, and this seemed a good opportunity for doing so without giving myself extra trouble. She had no references, so I took her on trial. She has remained ever since, and I like her for many reasons, but mostly because she is an American, and so quiet and unpre- tending, and capable withal. Sle told me to call her Nursy Brown; I don't even know her first name." "How strange not to have asked! I should have wanted to know if for no other reason only because she did not out with it in the first place. What did you say a spell ago about my pouring your coffee?" "No matter. I am just ready to go down myself now;" for, whatever my faults, it is one of my cardinal virtues to dress quickly, and, buttoning my cuffs as   I ran, I preceded Spicy to the dining- room. It was a well-ordered breakfast that smoked its greeting, and we did ample justice to every article on the table, and sipped our coffee with as much negligent case as if a change of base were not in contemplation. When we were quite through I was summoned to the culinary regions. "What is all this?"I asked, stop- ping on the threshold of the kitchen, like an exclamation point in the middle of a sentence. "Nothing, ma'am, only I am getting things ready, as Miss Spicy said.", "' I should think as much!" . The room  was literally piled with boxes, buckets, barrels, kettles, and every other conceivable jimcrack that could bo found in a country grocery! "I have some empty barrels hore, and shall I pack in them?" asked Myra. "'Yes, you may as well. Put these jars in first and get them out of the way." There were twenty-five of them; but they proved awkward things to pack, es- pecially in a barrel I I eolped. We tried them first on one side, then on the other, upside down and downside up, and at last stored away six! Myra looked perplexed "I do wish they would not mIake these things hol- low," she said. "So do I; but you must stuff in plates, bottles, fiying-paus, and platters, and try to fill up the chinks. Manage it some way, I have all I can do up-stairs," and, having given the intelligible direc- tion, I left hastily. "Where shall I put the crockery?"  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7037-00000006"/> asked Maggie, anxiously, as I flew through the dining-room. Bright's crib stood in the little hall ready for its journey. "Here, this will do, and then there was the hamper and the clothes-basket." "Medley  Medley  come herel" cried Spicy from the front door. I don't know what I ever did that I must have been punished with such a name  I think it was wrong, whatever my offence, to have fastened it upon me, a helpless, inexperienced infant I ow am I to know what a potent influence it may have had upon my whole character during my eventful earthly history  And another thing that cuts me, it is hardly ever pronounced in full except on occasions like this! I am called Meddio, ordinarily. "Only think!"Spicy went on, as I obeyed her summons, "these men say they can't wait a minute, for they have ever so many jobs on hand, and that you must be a funny woman to send for them before your packing is done!" "Go right up-stairs and begin taking out the furniture and carpets," I said quietly. "We sha'n't detain you many minutes." Up they went, two great, brawny, red-faced men, and I appointed Spicy doorkeeper extraordinary to their high- nesses. Before following them, I looked into the parlor long enough to see Nursy Brown tying up my crimson satin chairs  in their covers, and folding rugs and tidies with mathematical exactness. Lit- r tle Bright, perched on the sofa among his 1 toys, shook his patent rattlebox and  crowed, and I could but stop to give him r   a chapter of hugs and kisses. It did not hinder me, so I thought, yet when I got to my room I found it in the wildest disorder. The bed had been taken out, the carpet ripped up, and grim dust was holding high carnival. My Saratoga trunk had moved-empty. It was not a season for lamentations, so I made the most of the receptacles that remained. Alas, for my unlucky wardrobe! I folded for once without regard to creases, and squeezed every thing into the smallest compass. I jum- bled cuffs, collars, perfumery-bottles, camphor, and overshoes, into one com- partment together, and hustled whisk- brooms, hair-brushes, and match-safes, into the box with my best bonnet, and what would not go in anywhere else I tied up in a sheet. Seven loads! when I thought there would be only two or three! And lastly, the odds and ends. They were the most bulky of all my possessions. Such a quantity of bottles and jars I am sure never graced any other mansion  "Why didn't we think to send them back to the grocery?" remarked Myra, after they were stacked up on two carts and pretty generally cracked. "Or, we might have left them alto- gether, since the cost of the whole lot could not 'equal the price I am paying per lad for their moving," I remarked, dryly. Thus we grow in wisdom through many difficulties. At ten minutes past four in the after- noon we took possession of my new house, or, more correctly speaking, my old house, for a portion of it, one of its many wings, was the veritable shanty   which first saw the light when the great city was a little fur station. Spicy had ridiculed my choice, could not under- stand how I could "descend from an ele- vated marble front into such a coop," ever since she first learned of my inten- tion, and her exclamation as she stepped upon the veranda coincided with her previously-expressed views: "It is a piece of Noah's steamboat washed ashore! Tell me the truth, were these doors and windows manufactured since the flood?" After a hopeless effort to climb over a pile of mattresses which had been left directly before the door, she called out to know how she was going to get inside. "Wait a moment and I will remove those things," said Nursy Brown from the top of the stairs. I was behind Spicy.  Slhe turned quickly and looked at me: -/ \ "What a sweet voice! It just mag- etizes me. Do you know, Medley--" Call me Meddio, darling, on to-day of all days I 'Medley is too suggestive." "I will," said Spicy, laughing. "But what I was about to say was, that I am i beginning to think that person is some princess in disguise." "How absurd I "Not so' very absurd, either. She is all wound up in mystery, and her name fits her badly." "How so?" " Have you to ask? can't you see that hideous:cap she wears drawn down over her forehead as well as I? Have you never looked into her magnificent eyes? or reniarked her beautiful teeth?" "Certainly; but what of that? I see even more. She is a nursery maid whose   good qualities in her particular sploere render her invaluable. But as for her beauty, it has not yet struck me. In- deed, I regard her as excessively plain." "With that head-gear truly so. Oh, dear! Chaos exaggerated!-what a look- ing place " We had at last crossed the hreshold of my future home, and stood in the mlid- dle room, with the curious bay-window, which I had marked out as my future library. Every thing had been dumped in there pell-mell. The refrigerator stood up near the mantel, piled to the ceilings with pictures and parcels! the piano was covered with platters, pokers, and washboards; my elegant inlaid cabinet was lying on its back under a pile of chairs. My library table, top downward, supported one of the servants' trunks, and my two-hundred-dollar lace curtains were wrapped around the molasses jug. We both stared aghast! A moment after Spicy tripped up the stairs on a tour of investigation. Presently she called me to come too, and having no where else to go I obeyed. We could scarcely get into the rooms, for my bu- reaus were all placed in a row in one of the halls. "This is the very oddest pattern of a building!" said Spicy, looking about. We soon came to another flight of stairs, just like those in front, which de- scended into a spacious hall, opening through a glass-door upon a graveled walk to the north gate of the grounds. "Now, I smell romance in the air," exclaimed Spicy, pretending to make a telescope of her two hands. I laid my hand just then upon a side door, which I had not before seen, and  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7037-00000007"/> revealed to our surprise an immense pan- try I In it bedsteads and trunks were heaped promiscuously I "When will wonders cease "I asked. "Can't say," replied Spicy. We went outside, wandered round the house where there was green turf to step on, and at last came in through the laun- dry and kitchen. "'Tack tack I tack I Who's nailing down carpets?" asked Spicy. "Nursy Brown, ma'am," replied My- ra. "She's getting a room ready for you to stay in while we regulate and prepare something to eat." "Splendid!" cried Spicy. "I am hungry enough to eat a hard-shell Bap- tist. Well, well, Meddio, if here isn't your baby asleep in a champagne basket  You dear, precious, darling, little sweety," and, before I could throw in a remon- strance, t th thoughtless girl had buried her face among his clustering curls to kiss him, and he waked. Iie was not going to bo defrauded of his accustomed nap, which had been post- poned to such a late hour, without a pro- test, and set up a scream which brought Nursy Brown flying to the spot before either of us had time to turn round. She knelt down, spoke softly to the little cherub, kissed him, turned him over upon his side, and hushed him back to his dreams. "That was my naughty work," said Spicy, "but I could not help it; sure as I live and breathe and hope to die the  next minute, I couldn't. He is too en- ] ticing a subject altogether. Better put i him away out of my sight." "I have the blue-room, over the north 1 hall, almost ready for you; perhaps you    had better go up and lay your things off there, and I will bring you some chairs presently," remarked Nursy Brown. I thanked my good angel and departed. "The blue-room, indeed!" exclaimed Spicy, pausing before the open door. It was in the shape of a triangle, with a slanting ceiling on one side. The walls were hung with a fanciful blue paper. The carpet just laid was a piece of my old Wilton, with a blue ground, and the blue matched the paper with pretty ef- fect. The bed-room suite was blue me- dallion on satinwood, one that I had pur- chased the previous year for another and entirely different apartment. It had been chosen for the blue-room, with an eye to the admirable fitness of things, and was neatly arranged for our immediate con- venience. I looked over Spicy's shoulder in blank amazement! Then I remembered how I had not seen th; whole house be- fore renting it... I stepped in, glanced around, and then went to the window, which had a pleasant view of flowers and shrubbery in the yard. '"Where does this door go to?" asked Spicy. She had crossed the room and was trying to open what seemed to be the upper half of a door of a very antique pattern, and adjusted to the outside of tho wall without casings or panels. Just as I turned my head her efforts were re- warded, and so unexpectedly to her, that she came near being precipitated head- long down three or four steep steps into a sharp-pointed gable-roofed room with a snowy-white pine floor. It was dimly lighted by a diminutive square four-paned glass window at the far end, over which   clambering grape-vines from the arbor below had improvised a curious blind. "  Why, it is the closet belonging to this room, I suppose," was my reply. Spicy crowded herself in and I fol- lowed. "I'll tell you what it reminds me of: the old minister's postscript, which was always longer than the letter itself," she said, smiling. "Just the place for storing trunks," I remarked, after fitting my head into the widened space about the ridge-pole so that I could stand upright. "How could you get them in? I see no place but that little hole in the wall which has just admitted us, and a close fit at that. No, Meddie. I see how it is. This is the ghost department. I am not going to sleep in the blue-room for one." I laughed. "We are in the attic of the laundry, darlin;. Can't you see where it is joined to the main building? It was once, no doubt, the well-to-do chamber of an early settler, who expanded as the city grew and built on." There was a pile of rubbish in one corner, and I crouched under the slant- ing roof to see of what it was composed. Some old yellow manuscripts appertain- ing to law, a copy of "Barnes's Notes on the Gospels," "The Iistory of Scotland," a pamphlet on natural history, two or three old Hariper's Jagazines, some N2ew York Observers, and lastly, and, as it proved, by no means leastly, a bundle of letters tied neatly together witl a piece of red tape. "Spiritual crumbs! Fragments from (  ghostdom! What! are you going to   take them out from here?" exclaimed Spicy. "Yes. They will serve for our even- ing's entertainment, possibly." "But they may be full of secrets which we ought never to know I " "If of any very grave importance they would not have been thrown away, in my opinion." "Oh, we can't tell, tMeddie. Some- body may htavo lost or forgotten thllo. It don't seem riglit to read them, any how." "Nonsense, Spicy! You are tired and dyspeptic. What can there be wrong about it? My conscience is perfectly easy on the subject." "But the very look at them gives me the creeps all up and down my back. See how I tremble;" and she put her land in mine. "You are a goosey'," I said, pinching her cheeks. Myra appeared with a waiter of tea and toast and cold boiled tongue, and we forgot all else in our greediness. Fif- teen minutes later we gathered up the crumbs and the empty dishes, set them out in the hall, and declared ourselves greatly refreshed. Myra looked in again presently to say: "Nursy Brown wishes the ladies to stay up here until every thing is fixed up and righted down stairs.  lere are your matches, mn'nam, for th gas when thel daylight is over." "That is a nurse worth having, Med- die. I should keep her always, and then will and bequeath her to my sister, if I were you," exclaimed Spicy. I was just dropping into an easy-chair, which had been placed in the room by  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7037-00000008"/> unseen hands, when Spicy threw the package of letters at me. 1 "Do find out what they are as quick as possible; I know we shall both be sorry for it, but I sha'n't rest until it is over. They are in a gentleman's hand." "I thought they were in my hand." "You just notice, Meddio, those p's, and the loops of the g's. They are cer- tainly masculine." "I didn't know that letters of the al- phabet had any gender." She came to me, pulled out one of the letters and commenced its examination. "He signs himself 'G. G.' Did you ever hear that conundrum, 'Why is the letter g like death? '" "No, Spicy. Wlhy?" "' Because it makes ghosts of hosts, and is always in the middle of slaugh- ter.'" "Do look at this letter. It is as thick as a small book, and as full of romance as an egg is of meat. I've seen the word love twice!" I took it from her hand, smiling. It was in a bold type of penmanship, not handsome, and very closely lined. It was a reply to the questionings of a friend, and the subject was of the most delicate character. The writer, from certain allusions, had evidently offered himself previously to his fair correspond- ent, and her decision remained in abey- ance. Meanwhile he had been called upon for a chapter in his earlier history, and after some apparent hesitation it had been produced. I read aloud -   CHAPTER II. THE MYSTERIOUS LETTER. "As I told you, Helen, I completed my sophomore year in Williams College in the summer of 1852. I think you are already familiar with some of the pecca- dilloes of my college life, and now I will acquaint you with what occurred on the memorable moonless evening previous to that commencement. "I had distinguished myself some weeks before by mapping out a novel parade over the burial of Euclid, which had so taken with the boys that I had been elected chairman of the committee who perfected the programme and of fended the faculty. In order to swell our numbers we invited several from the junior class, and then levied a. tax on all to defray expenses. At the prize exhibition in the church we distributed notices of what was in contemplation later in the evening, but it was full half-past eleven o'clock before we had our torch-light procession formed into line. By the time we had reached the stage which had sprung up since dark in front of the old college buildings, every house in the vil- lage had poured its occupants into the street. Not less than eight hundred, more probably one thousand, people stood in the dew and damp to witness the pa- geant. "The funeral car was drawn by six white horses, and upon a piece of white marble in the centre lay the remains of the departed. The chief mourners were 'Prof. Tat' in effigy (Prof. Tat was the way our faithful mathematical professor was dubbed), and the widow of Euclid with a wailing babe in her arms. The   last-named individual was a dumpy little body, with a round face hidden under a large Navaring bonnet trimmed with geese feathers and crape. The other mourners were grotesquely attired, each carrying out some extravagant caprice of his own, and the effect was greatly heightened by the brilliant light of the torches. "We had halted, and were about to ascend the platform, when the discovery was noted that, through haste in its con- struction, we had forgotten the steps  A good-natured freshman, seeing our em- barrassment, doubled himself for the ben- efit of the crowd, and over him the prin- cipal actors crawled, tumbled, and rolled up, amid roars of laughter from one end of the village to the other, the amused spectators supposing it a part of the an- ticipated performance. "Six of the best singers among us con- stituted our choir, and were dressed in long white farmers' frocks. They wore hideous false-faces which had movable jaws, and when they appeared on the stage they threw them wide open, and waited the order to sing. The volley of musio which poured forth at last occa- sioned great applause, and then followed an oration from the brain and lips of yours truly, which nearly cost him his voice, after which came another song, excelling the first in volume, and finally a poem, full of good points and witty hits, a mock eulogy on the virtues of the deceased. It closed thus: ' We'll bury him in the earth so deep, Prof. Tat never more can find him;' at which the sophomores groaned. "When all was ready, we started for the grave, and the assemblage followed.   Up hill and down grade, by farm-house and through glen, for one, two, three, ay, four miles, this weird procession moved in solemn state. Then came the welcome order 'to the right,' and into green pas- tures we turned, and by still waters we tarried, until the last rites had been per- formed. A funeral pile was kindled after the manner of the heathen Chinee, and the widow advanced with the apparent intention of perishing with her lamented, but after going through a variety of gy- rations she tossed her baby into the devouring elements, turned immediately and selected a cavalier, took his arm and headed the march homeward. "The Gods usually sell their wares at a fair price, but that night's fun cost nme dear. I got to my room just as day dawned in the east, damp, cold, and weary. I paused before my little, one- sided looking-glass (an heirloom in the fanily), and was shocked at the one- sided picture of blood-shot eyes and hag- gard features which I presented. To tell you the truth, Ilelen, I never took any special pride in my red hair, but on that morning it seemed to strike me as espe- cially and altogether unbecoming, and finally settled upon my imagination as a positive calamity. I dwell upon these facts, trivial as they may seem, because from them, and the consequent loss of self-respect, I date many of the untoward events which have since rendered my life desolate. I found before the day was far advanced that I had taken a severe cold in my head, and that my throat was wretchedly sore. "I hung about the church during the exercises, which I remember only as hav- ing been hot and long. In the evening I l!  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7037-00000009"/> was a favored guest at a private banquet, where we ate roast lamb and other deli- cacies of the season in a subterranean apartment. I was obliged to take an in- ventory of my pocket-handkerchiefs be- fore dressing for the occasion, and, as they numbered only nine, I applied to my chum for the loan of three more, in order to make myself presentable. At two o'clock in the morning I returned to my room to dump my traps into a trunk and get ready to leave Williamstown in the stage at seven. "Did you ever take a ride over the Berkshire Hills? If so, I need not add here that it has no direct tendency to- ward soothing irritable nerves, particu- larly if you occupy the back seat in a crowded stage. I was not in a state of mind or body to be envied when I com- menced the descent of Savoy Mountain, for the five long, dusty miles of continu- ous climbing since we left the Adams val- ley, with its innumerable sharp, short, jerking, jolting downs, had failed to im- prove my temporal condition. My eyes took no delight in the wild, romantic scenery of this region, about which Old- World travellers might well afford to rave; hills swelling above each other, and undu- lations shapely and uncouth, smooth and rugged, graceful and fantastic, thrown negligently side by side, bounding the view in every direction. I simply sat bolt upright like any other schoolboy, clinching my umbrella firmly with one hand, and using my pocket-handkerchief with the other, meanwhile staring at the two martyrized-looking four-legged ani- mals before us, which according to the driver were 'hosses,' as they rushed on furiously without regard to rough and   stony places, seeming only to desire to keep out of the way of the ponderous vehicle in their rear. I "All at once I was conscious of an awkward, bewildering sense of being about to stand on my head, and a crash! "The next I knew of myself I was trying to disengage my foot from some- body's limp bonnet. The whole estab- lishment was literally in a heap by the wayside, one of the fore-wheels having divorced itself without the aid of West- ern lawyers, and started off sidewise on its own account. "The team had come to a stand-still, without showing the slightest sign of embarrassment or surprise.  Indeed, I suppose they had lived in this wicked world so long that they were prepared for any mishap. They stood calmly nib- bling the few stunted blades of grass within range of their noses on the over- hanging bank. The driver, a good-na- tured, long-haired, middle-aged man, was looking after the killed and wounded. He found several cases of torn clothes, and one or two serious scares. I camo forth froln the wreck with an ugly bump on the side of my head. "Upon   examination it was found quite impossible to patch up the stage, even for temporary convenience, and we were obliged to walk to the nearest farm- house and wait for the master of cere- monies to institute researches in regard to the whereabouts of some one who had vehicles to lend. It was a two-story cot- tage of the ancient New England cut and finish which we reached at length, and entered through a grassy enclosure and a wide-open door. A  motherly-looking   matron came forward and gave us kindly greeting. She rolled up the paper cur- tains in her best room-they had large flowers in the centre-and pushed up the windows. There was a table, with Bax- ter's 'Saints' Rest' and 'The Life of Mrs. Isabella Graham' upon it, with two large drawers in front, a quaint rocking- chair, covered with copperplate calico, and a highl bed, ornamenLed with a patch- work bed-quilt and valance, in the room. Enough chairs speedily made their ap- pearance for our accommodation, and the good woman listened with undisguised interest to the account of our unlucky catastrophe, and then bathhed my wound with arnica, and gave me some snoezing- snuff for my cold. "I saw a pretty, rosy-cheeked girl in the next room braiding hats out of palm- leaf split very fine, and, like college boys in general, I was taken with thirst ilm- mediately. I went out and asked liher for a drink of water, but she served me in sutch a high-bred style that I had noth- ing to do but return to the parlor when I had drained the goblet. I dropped into the nearest chair, however, and through the half-open door watched her move- ments. She held a consultation with her mamna, after which she laid an immacu- late table-cloth upon two tables put to- gether, one being high and narrow and the other low and broad; plates and knives and forks followed; tumblers for the company and mugs for the family; a bigr pitcher of water; a plate of cabbage; another of potatoes; a small round dish full of turnips; a platter of corn-beef; a boiled Indian pudding; a custard pie; and the salt-cellar, and the vinegar cruet, and the pepper-box, and the molasses 2   cup, and the butter, just wlore it was most convenient to tuck them. 1 The men folks meanwhile came in from their work, and washed their hlands and faces at the sink, at the far end of the kitchen, and wiped them on a rolling towel. Then they all pulled out thoir pocket-combs and straightened out their locks. When they were ready, weo were invited to the ttable. They stood back until wo were all seated, and then squeezed themselves in where they could got a chlance. It was a well-cooked and palatable dinner, and the hungry stage passengers did it ample justice. Whilo woe were eating, the pretty Mary Ann stood at the back of our chairs, and kept tleo flies from te table with brancthes of asparagus, and the famuily cat jumped into each of our laps to ascertain for herself, no doubt, whether we 1lad all thlo pro- requisites for her intimate friendship. "We coilld lear the rolling of distant thunder as wo climbed into the red-and- blue falrmer's wagon, all innocent of springs, whchl the driver had secured withl which to finish our journey. As tho rising cloud in the west obscured theo sun's rays, I looked for my umbrella. Alas, it had been spilled in the general spill, and no one had blad the forethought to gather it up I the lowering black- ness grow nearer and still more near. the thunders bellowed in our very ears. The storm was upon us. No soft, warm, refreshing, namby-pamby drizzle, but a great splashing, dashing, deluging ]Mas- sachusetts pour! Bonnets and hlats wilted like young tomato plants in the hot sun I We were--in a mulch shorter space of time than it takes to tell it-soaked from the crowns of our heads to the soles of our  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7037-00000010"/> feet. Simultaneously with the wetting came a violent pelting with hailstones. A barn, with its two great doors open, caught the driver's eye. It was a little off the road, but the horses' heads were turned toward it; a tip one way, a tip the other, a twist, the striking of the fore-wheels against the wagon body, rapid jolting over a few loose planks, and a sudden elevation, brought us under its friendly shelter, where we sat drip- ping and waiting and thinking, and think- ing and dripping and waiting, for a full round miserable hour. "As the storm abated, we were back- ed skilfully out of our place of refuge, and the horses put into a run to make up for time lost. At sunset I was set down at Rockland Place, and most affec- tionately welcomed by my father and mother, although in my disfigured con- dition I must have been any thing but an object of parental pride. "I may as well stop here to tell you that from my earliest recollections I had understood that I was destined for the ministry. My own predilections had not been taken into account any more than the fact that, as a schoolboy, I had floun- dered about seven-eighths of the time in a slough of unintelligible learning. .' It run in the family,' my grandmother used to say. Her grandfather and father were both ministers, and she married a minis- ter. My honored sire iad veered from the clerical groove, and settled down early in life as a tiller of the soil; but I, of the later generation, was doomed to walk in the footsteps of my ancestors. "Rockland Place, our old homestead, has been described to you in a former letter --   "We must look that up; I would like to hear about it," interrupted Spicy. "- hence I will not recapitulate its charms just now. I am sure that my mother's sofa-rocker never fitted all the angles in my body so satisfactorily on any other occasion. Her- cosy, cheerful sitting-room, with the books onthe table, the flowers on the mantel, and the kitten on the rug, never seemed half so cheer- ful and comfortable as then. I fell into a state of agreeable content. The very air was redolent with repose and rested me. "Supper was served on, an old-fash- ioned round ebony table at my elbow. A cup of fine oolong tea, smoking waffles, delicious bread and butter, and straw- berries and cream- real cow's cream, as brother Fred would say. My sister Phebe was at Mount Holyoke Seminary, and it never occurred to me to inquire after her until the evening was far spent. "'She is to be at home to-morrow,' said my mother. 4A young miss from the school is coming with her to spend the vacation. "'lMay sh be hanged first,' was my impulsive rejoinder. "My father and mother both looked up in astonishment I "' How is that?' asked the former; 'it is the first time I ever heard you ob- ject to visitors I ' "' I don't object to themll as rule,' I replied, slightly ashamed of myself for ex- pressing my mind so hastily. 'But I am not in a mood just now for making my- self agreeable, I can't speak, as you see, without sneezing, and even then I must speak through my nose, which gives my voice an intolerable twang. Strangers   are an abomination under such circum- stances, and school-girls, if possible, a de- gree worse. And South Hadley girls above all others. Tall, prim, school- marmish paragons of perfection, got up with special reference to missionaries and country ministers with small means.' "' Take it easy, my son. This little girl who is coming is no husband hunter, and I don't believe she would lay violent hands upon you if she were,' said my fa- ther, in his serio-comic style. "I was angry with the good man for laughing at me, and I was angry with myself for being angry. I was seized with a violent fit of coughing, and my mother hurried me off to bed and nursed me with the most loving attention. But, in spite of hot ginger tea and mustard drafts, I passed a feverish, restless night, and, when the sun in the discharge of his public duty arose next morning, I was painfully conscious of dull, heavy aches all over my body. "I dressed  myself, for I could breathe better sitting up, and joined the family at the breakfast-table. I had no appetite, however, I was only ornamen- tal there. After prayers I went out on the veranda. The storm had cleared away and the air was fresl and bracing. Prince, my favorite pony, was feeding on the lawn. I asked my father if he didn't tlink it would be a brilliant idea for me to saddle him and take a ride. He smiled, and said that it so seemed to him, if I was willing to make the ride a matter of convenience. He wanted to send for the mail, and my mother wanted a bag of flour from the mill. "I bathed my face plentifully with water-it is one of my remedies for a cold   in the lead-and then mounted my steed and cantered away. It was a glorious morning. Bryant must have had such a one in his mind when he spoke of the pure air up in this part of the world as a ,.spiritual thing.' By tie way, his birth- place is just over the hill by the meeting- house road. I could see the roof and tfrim chimneys from amnong the poplars which had cast their shadows over theml or scores of years. How his boylood must have been dotted through and through with similar bright days, moro particularly grateful just after the earth had been washed by a shower like that of yesterday! "The post-office was in a small store, where groceries, hardware, confection- ery, and millinery dwelt in harmony to- gether. The store-keeper was also the post-master and the town-clerk. He lived in the other end of the building, and his wife tended shop while he ate his meals. They were a well-assorted pair, patient in the pursuit of knowledge and invaluable to the society in which they moved. Mr. Foote spent most of his time in the store door, his help-meet in the pantry-window of the basement. He was of medium stature, slightly bent, and fifty. His large, greenish eyes took lme in that morning and well-nigh swallowed me. "'Hav'n't you been riding that nag rather fast for a warm mornin'? loieme from college, eh? I don't see as you look as if you know any more than you did when you went up there. Goin' to help the old man about his hayin', or have you got too stuck up for that? Reckon you've spreed it pretty hard,' was the salutation with which I was greeted.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7037-00000011"/> "I asked for letters, and Prince lifted up one of his fore-feet, ostensibly to kick off the flies, and put it down again. "'There's only one here for your folks, and it's got a name on it that I sup- pose belongs to the school-gal Phebe is goin' to bring along with her. I don't know where it's from, but it's post-marked Buffalo. Guess it's a love-letter. If your folks are gittin her up here to make a match for you, they'll ]lave to work lively.' "' Thank you, I suppose they will. Can I have the letter ' "The man shifted his position and sat down on a keg of molasses. Then he called out: "'Esther, fetch me that letter we were a talkin' about. The young parson wants it.' Then to me, ' How much bet- ter off do you take it you be than my boy who is milkin' cows and diggin' po- tatoes for a living? '  "'I really don't know, sir. I hope he is quite well,' I replied. "Just then the document was brought to me, and after reading the address, 'Miss Ida Everett,' in a bold, dashing hand, I put it in my side-pocket, and turned my face millward. I had scarce- ly proceeded half a dozen rods when I heard my name called, and looking up saw Mrs. Cook standing in the front door of her little cottage. I reined Prince up so close to the great flat stone which formed her door-step, that I nearly broke down her spotted lily bush. "'Well, this is a surprise now Be's you home from college, Gideon ' "I answered in the affirmative, as that was a point necessary to be establish- ed before proceeding with the interview.   LxJ. "' Pretty well, are you?' "'Not very, I have a severe cold in my head;' and I sneezed immediately to establish my veracity beyond question. "'You don't sayI Wall, now, I never I You've been kinder careless over there to Williamstown, hav'n't you? you'd better take some thoroughwort tea right away, to keep it from settling on your chist.' "'I wish it would settle on my chdist, anywhere but in my head,' I responded, irreverently. "'That's wicked, Gideon; it might throw you into a consumptive. low do you like college? Awful strict over there, aint they? ' "' Very.' "'Do tellI Phebe's comin' home pretty soon, I hear? ' "'To-day.' "'Now, you don't tell me  They were a sayin' over to the post-office that there was a school-gal comin' along with her to stay a spell. I don't know what her name is? You'll be a sparkin' her up, I s'pose ' "'Not I. I'm coming home one of these days to marry Ruth Damon. Don't you think I had better?' "'Ruth Damon I Why, you must be crazy I She's older than our Mary  She's never had a beau since that fellar came up from Northampton in his antic horse and team and took her ridin'-and that was much as twenty year ago. You marry Ruth Damon t Well, all I have to say is, if you do, you'll make two shift- less couples I' "'I thought you used to say I bade fair to make a good husband.' "'I don't mean nothin' to the contra   of that now. But you and Ruth Damon could not get along togetler, I knows. Why, lands alive! she can't iron a shirt decent, and that's no character for a minister's wife. A poor stick you'd be a takin' care of an unpractical woman  You've been brung up too tender like. I always said so. You hain't got no better hands than a woman. I don't mean to say anythin' agin your mother, for she is master good if she is smart feelin'. We've got all over that grudge of ourn about her ketchin your father when he was as good as engaged to dar- ter Mary. She didn't mean no harm, I s'pose.' "'See, how was that, Mrs. Cook?' I asked, although I had heard the story a score of times. "'Why, you see, your father was our minister's son I h eld him in my arms when he was a baby, and seen him grow up around us. WhIy, we were almost as near kin as relations, because Captain Cook rung the bell for meetin' all those years that your grandfather Gildersleeme preached the gospel to us. Wall, as I was a sayin', when your father got to be tall and handsome lie you here afore me, and went round a courtin' the gals, he was thought somethin of a ketch, and we reckoned a good deal on gettin' him into our family. He used to come a knockin' here Sunday nights and pre- tended it was to get the key of the church, but the Captain and I knew a thing or two, if he was so sly. Bime-by up come a school-gal with Fidelia Raymond, and every thing was all nip and pucker, and that was the end of poor Mary. She's been so heart-broke she's never incour- aged nobody's affections since. I'm   afeared you are agoin' to be took in just as your father was.' "'And then what will become of poor Ruth?' I replied, with mock grav- ity, as I lifted my hat and rode away. "Dear Mrs. Cook I I shall always re- member her. She was one of that class of women of whom a sample may be found in almost every New England vil- lage, whose business it is to find out everybody else's business, and who at- tend to their own business by minding everybbdy else's business. What she lack- ed in knowledge she made up in native inquisitiveness. Sle had a fislion of stopping passcrs-by, particularly young people and children, to ask questions and recite the latest news. It had been my favorite amusement to be thus arrested ever since I could remember. If she was not on the lookout, I usually coughed to attract her attention. lHer quaint and original use of the English language was my especial delight. She had none of the cunning and sly malice of her neigh- bors, the postmaster and his wife, but garnered up every grain of information obtainable, added it to her stock in trade, turned it over and over, enlarged upon it, and scattered it broadcast through tiao town. She was to such a community what a daily newspaper is to a city, and about as reliable. Captain Cook (not the one who was killed at the Sandwich Isl- ands) hoed his onions and cabbages in the little garden south of the house, and did, duty for over half a century at the bell-rope in the vestibule of the white church, which had such an aristocratic way of standing on the side-hill by it- self, and looking down upon its long rows of horse-sheds.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7037-00000012"/> "My errand at the mill was quickly accomplished. As I came out upon the steps Prince sidled off, and the mill-boy ran to bring him back. Waiting there, I looked up at the eighty maple trees on the bank, between the road and the fence. How singular that they should be in pairs I From my point of observa- tion they had the appearance of a board- ing-school procession just ready for their morning march. They winked and blink- ed at me, and seemed to say: 'We know a story of long ago, Which has rendered this spot famous.' What, the old ' Mountain Miller' book I Who cares for that, or the spring where the good man used to drink, either I It was welling up though, cool and clear, from under the soft green shade, and I was thirsty. It would put that band of school-girls out of my head, perhaps, to take a drink. I stepped along nimbly to where I could rest my knee on a neat- ly contrived little bridge, a few incles in width, and, with the tip of my nose in the water, succeeded in obtaining the coveted draught. Upon the trunk of the tree nearest the spring were carved in- numerable names. How charming to leave one's autograph to posterity, I thought to myself as I pulled out my pocket-knife and rudely cut my own. "Prince had not been altogether pleased with the plan of carrying a bag on his back, and it took some time for us to convince him that it would not in- terfere with his future respectability, or prevent his moving in the best society, if he behaved himself. In the end I was conveyed home with exceeding celerity. "I found my mother busy in the kitchen. I lounged in the parlor awhile,   trying to read. My eyes rebelled, and then I sat down at the piano and pro- duced from it a few discordant notes. Finally, I took a turn through the gar- den, picked some syringas and bachelor- buttons and tried to construct a nosegay, but failed. "Upon the other side of the street was a blank wall, below which was a ste'ep grassy declivity, terminating in the bed of a babbling brook. Some years before I had chosen this site for the erec- tion of a sort of study-houlse for myself. It was founded upon two rocks, one upon either side of the stream, and remained a mournful specimen of my boyish at- tempt at architecture. Going down to it for the want of something better to do, I found its outer wall desecrated by a huge placard-TAKEN.  Dolefully as I felt, I could not help smiling, knowing that it was one of my father's innumer- able pleasantries. I went in, and, seeing the old rickety settee in its accustomed place, I threw myself upon it in a half- sitting posture, with my head and feet well supported, and fell into a reverie, which ended in a nap, and the nap ended in the following manner: "'No. I will never marry a wid- ower, nor a minister, nor a man with red hair. What a queer old shell this is'. CHAPTER III. TIE VISION OF BEAUTY. "THE speaker at that instant appear- ed before the entrance to my retreat, and paused, looking curiously into my face. It was a vision that came upon me like the glimpse of some better world, and   caused me to forget that I was made of clay. It was a slight, graceful girl, in fresh white muslin, with blue ribbons floating from hair, neck, and waist; rib- bons that must have been selected to match her eyes, which were of a heav- enly shade, more beautiful than any I had ever seen, and about her half-parted mouth a great many little lights hovered. Dear Helen, was not that enough to be- wilder the senses of a susceptible youth just waking out of slumber? "And now. listen to what follow- ed! Phebo discovered me in the same breath. "Oh, Grandison! Mother said you were up-stairs asleep, and has kept us running round the hlouse on tip-toe ever since we arrived. She says you are lalf sick. I should think as much I You are a pretty-looking youth I I should say you had been on a spree for a fortnight,' and then she walked in and kissed me in her old sisterly way, as if that could make amends for the suspicion she had cast upon my morals I "I was furious, but hadn't vim enough to show it, and before I could have spoken, if I had made the'effort, Phebo went on: "' My brother, Miss Everett, a mis- creant who has seen better days.' "And that was our introduction. "I bowed stiffly as I rose from my ungainly position. My feet were so numb that I could not plant them firm- ly and thereby give myself a manly air. I could do nothing, in fact, but look very. awkward and embarrassed, and, like the famous parrot, think a great deal with- out speaking a word. "Pardon  my intrusion; it was   wholly unintentional I assure you,' said Miss Everett, retreating. "'Yes, we came down hero to road our love-letters and give the dotminio season for repose, antd have all unwit- tingly run into the lion's very den,' chimed in Phebo.  'But we will leave you to commence your dream just where it was broken off. Adieu.' "And they were gone. ' I watched them through a big crack in my hermitage, as they wandered arm- in-arm along the vale, and finally as- cenldd the bank and disappeared. An hour later the bell rang for dinner. As I came in sight of the house two pink- and-whto clouds, with blue streamers, flitted through the doorway. The table was adorned with prettily-arranged bou- quets of pinks, mignonettes, sweet peas, and roses. The visitor was placed at my father's right hand, and Pliebo at his left. I sat under my mother's wing. "Our house had a southerly front, and an unobstructed prospect of two or more niles of country scenery. There was a broad green meadow in the f(,ro- ground, a grove of hackmatack trees- wliere we sometimes held picnics-just beyond, a saw-mill and two or three houses near the base of a hill in the dis- tance, two brown cottages, about half way up, my grandmother's white domicile on the summit, and, a little farther on, the pretentious dwelling of Mr. Pinker- ton, the greatest horso-jockey in tho country. The fields in every direction resembled an irregularly-pieced patch- work bed-quilt, such a one as might have been producoe in a sewing society. "My mother left the door ajar to give Miss Everett a glimpse of this pretty  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7037-00000013"/> view, for she always argued that if peo- ple had fine tastes they ought to be in- dulged in them. The draft coming upon my back, through the same open door, made me sneeze. With my handkerchief doing duty, I pressed my fingers firmly upon my upper lip to prevent any fur- ther explosion. Alas! vain were my ef- forts. I sneezed again, got purple in the face, coughed, sneezed, cried, sneezed, choked, sneezed, and left the table with- out asking to be excused. "My mother followed me to my room, bringing my dinner with her; but I had no appetite. She stroked my fore- head lovingly, and laid a wet cloth across my eyes, then went down again. Phebe came up when dinner was over, and sat a half an hour with me. She chatted about the seminary, Lily White, Miss Jessop, the ride from Northampton, etc. "'It's awful provoking in you, Grand- ison, to go and catch such a cold just at this time. Your eyes look as if they had been soaked over-night in skim- milk, your face is swollen like a porpoise, and, in short, you haven't a good look left. Only to think! I've been boast- ing about your beauty and your fine manners for a year, and then brought my room-mate home with me, expecting her to be love-struck at sight, and you have gone and got up such a ridiculous first impression.' "' Good heavens I quit your non- sense ' was my emphatic exclamation. "Night came, and so did the doctor, for my father had great faith in the doc- trine that 'a stitch in time saves nine.' After going through the usual ceremo- nies of pulse-feeling and interrogations, the man of the saddle-bags gave his   opinion and a prescription. My father gave him a dollar for each. But there was no evading the fever with which I was threatened. It was already creep- ing through every vein in my body. I did not stand upon my feet again for weeks. Verily I was at death's door, although at the time happily unconscious of my situation. My mother's gentle hands bathed my scorched forehead and cooled my parched lips. Not always. There were other hands that ministered to my necessities, and there was magnet- ismn in their touch. I missed them when at intervals they smoothed not my pil- low. I dreamed of blue eyes, fancied the skies were full of them, all beyond my reach, and I starving to death for the want of a pair. - Then I was transported to a land where angels dwelt. I was carried there in a broken-down stage, with only tlree wheels, and people on the way laughed at my distress when I asked for a cushion for my head. All the angels wore white muslin, and the air was perfumed with new-mown hay. I .was happy for awhile, particularly when my face was whisked with ribbons and my neck scratched with finger-rings. During one of my ecstatic moments I was precipitated into my little room in the college-buildings at Williamstown, and there found my bureau crammed with letters addressed to 'Miss Ida Ev- erett,' and each letter contained a pair of ear-rings tipped with blue. There was no end to my vagaries. Sometimes I was riding Prince over a mountain of bouquets. At others trying to climb high places in pursuit of fairies. Then I took a prejudice to colors, refused to take medicine that was white, or green, 01   red, or brown, or black, and my attend- ants were perplexed to know whlat to do with me. I did not look at it; I only asked what the color was. Finally, a sweet voice told me it was blue! After that I was satisfied. "It was on a bright August aftcrnoon that I opened my eyes, with my reason onco mnore enthroned. My room was a picture of neatness and comfort. My eyes wandered from one famliliar object to another, and fell at last upon a tiny glove on the foot of the bed. My mother was sitting by me and spoke my name softly. "'Yes, mother. I have been very sick, have I?' "1Ier tears rained, and she kissed me tenderly. "'But you are restored to us again. Keep quiet now, and we will talk it over hereafter.' "My recovery from that hour was rapid. Yet, for many days, I saw no one save my mother and the physician. The house was still as the Sabbath, and I was haunted by a strange fear that ny goddess had departed(- -One day I ven- tured to ask for Plhebo., Ilhd avoided her name hitherto, for ai singular dread took possession of my soul at every ap- proach to the subject, which was inex- plicable. "'She is sick, dear.' "'Very ' "'There are no alarming symptoms at present.' "Is it the fever? "'Yes; but of a very mild type.' "'Who takes care of her? You are always with nme.' "' Ida Everett. She is a most excel.   lent nurse for one so young, and what renders it all the more pleasant, she is devotedly attached to Phche.' "Dear foolishness of mankind I1 ow I was thrilled by the mention of that name I It was my private, very privlte opinion that the desire to hear it and know that its proprietor was still a dwell- er under our roof, had been preying upon my mind for a much longer period than I was even aware of myself. It was like some far-oft pain suddenly bereft of its sting. I closed my eyes and remained silent for a time. My mother must have thought me asleep, for she quitted the room noiselessly. How long afterward I have no idea, luMt I was conscious of a presence, although I heard no sound. I raised my eyelids languidly, and all my faculties were at once plunged into a torpor of admiration I The young, bright creature, who had so moved my soul to its very depths, was standing before the mantel pouring something from a small phal into a tumbler. She wore a pretty French calico, lmad after the fashion of the period, and which scorned to endow her with a dignity, a softness, and a grace that all the panoply of feathers, silks, and flowers had fiiled to enrich any other lady of my acquaintance with. I could see her face reflected in the mirror upon the bureau, but she never once glanced toward me.  I was as one dead, my breath held by an irresistille fascination, until, with the medicine in her hand, she had gone as quietly as she came. "Then a profound calm descended upon me. The poetry of a whole life seemed to centre in one being. I knew she had been there before. The dream had not been all a dream.  She had  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7037-00000014"/> helped to take care of me during the dark season when I was balancing be- tween life and death. She had been wit- ness to all my sick follies. Ah I what had she thought of me I Would she ever come to my room again  "I asked this last question of myself over and over again during the long days of convalescence. But I opened not my lips to any living mortal. Of Phebe I beard encouraging accounts. The dis- ease had touched her lightly, and the prospects were favorable toward her get- ting down stairs before me. I grew grave and melancholy. The doctor rec- ommended change of air and scene as soon as I should have gained strength sufficient for a journer. "One morning my mother did not come to me as usual; Mrs. Manning, a bungling, good-hearted neighbor, brought me my breakfast of toast and tea. I asked for an explanation, and was told that "'Mrs. Gildersleeve was busy just now.' "I was restless and wretched, I knew not why. Tle atmosphere oppressed me, and I complained of cold hands. Mrs. Manning bustled about, doing nothing generally, and at last discovered that my feet were cold too. It had been a cool night, and from the south window a strong breeze fanned me. The doctor had been specific about it. I must not run any risk of getting chills. he had repeated the caution many times, for I was weak still. I asked for a shawl or blanket to be thrown across the bed, but, instead, the monster appeared with two bottles of hot water, which she insisted upon placing at my. feet. I remonstrated   as vigorously as the circumstances would permit, but she said, 'Well folks knew best about such things.' "Perhaps they do, as a rule, but they don't always put their corks into their bottles tight enough, as I found to my sorrow, for in a few minutes the smoking contents were spread through the length and breadth of my bed. "I raved. No school-boy ever called for his mother with more vehemence than I did for mine. I literally yelled. My persecutress tried to silence me, begged me to tell her what was the mat- ter, offered to do any thng in the world for me, only not frighten the family; but, after using a good many adjectives not to be found in the catechism, I as- sured her that, unless my wishes were instantly gratified, I should arise and go to my mother myself. Then she disap- peared. L In the course of three or four min- utes the door was pushed open, and Ida Everett stepped lightly into the room, came straight to my bedside, and taking one of my hands in both of hers said: ' I am so sorry for you, but you really cannot see your mother to-day. Is there any thing we can do to comfort you?' "'Why I What has happened to my mother? ' "A mortal terror seized me.  Iy brain seemed to have taken fire. I was permeated as it were with an intuitive apprehension of dire calamity, and my eyes almost started from their sockets. "' She is not well, and I am requested to ask you to remain as quiet and as pa- tient as possible. Mrs. Manning has volunteered to stay with you, and will do I ill she can.'   "'No doubt of it, even to the filling of my bed with hot water. What ails mother?  "She hesitated a second.  There was truth in her sweet blue eyes, and she could not carry out the deception they had deemed prudent to impose upon Inc. "' I must know all. Is she dead?' The words oozed from my lips like blood from a poniard wound. "' She is.' "My senses seemed suddenly to de- sert me. I neither dreamed nor suffered. I had fainted away. When I again opened my eyes my room was almost dark, and my father was supporting mny hiead in his arms. Some one adminis- tered a tonic to my lips, and I recognized the tiny, tapering fingers that guided the spoon. Then my memory returned, and I summoned all the forces of my will to speak. It was some time, however, be- fore I could articulate a syllable. "'Forgive me; I ought never to have come into this room, for I might lhavo known that I sliould have betrayed all at the very first questionings, and the shock has almost killed you,' came from a low, choked voice near by. "I struggled a moment for strength, then I caught the little hand which was now fanning me gently, and covered it with kisses. She drew it away, not has- tily, and caressed my burning forehead, while my father sobbed like a woman. "'Tell me all about it,' I stammered at last. "She had been stricken with paraly- sis, and never breathed afterward, my precious, loving, darling lady mother; and as I looked into my father's face I   felt that I should soon lose him also, for grief had crushed him. he had growni old, altered, fritghtful. Ilis stiffened lips essayed to speak, but ended only in a groan. flis eyes, which I had known as sending forth only flashes of humor and pride and love, were glassy and dim. Iis lips were pallid, and premature wrinkles had settled across his handsome forehead. "I don't know how the story was telegraphed to my brain, or whose elo- quence taught me to forget myself in pity for the strong, suffering man at my side. I wept bitter tears, but they were for his great, hopeless sorrow, and not for my own. All at once he looked down at me long and earnestly. Then he stooped and kissed me once, twice, thrice. The little act was in itself a vol- ume, for I had never received such a ca- ress-fromn him since I had arrived at mal's stature. "You are very like her,' he said. "Good God, how his face lighted up! How splendid, how  tender, were his eyes for that one momentl How much fascination in his warm, true soul, re- fined and elevated by suchl a companion- ship as had been his blessing thus far on the journey of life! How sweet and fiery with passion was his voice, and his submission 1 Did he deceive himself when he bowed his head and said sol- emnly: "'O Lord. our beloved heavenly Father, thy will be done.' "Exhausted, I fell into a quiet shiti- bcr, from which I passed into a hnl'- dozing, ecstatic state, more allrming than my previous delirium. My father's youngest sister, Aunt Sally, came and as-  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7037-00000015"/> sumed command of our stricken house- hold, and devoted herself principally to me. The funeral was conducted so qui- etly that not a sound reached my ears, and only muffled footsteps and soft whis- pers rippled the air of my apartment for days afterward. Once more I almost bridged the chasm into the better world beyond the skies-- " "A whole sheet missing "I had paused and been searching for it for some moments. "What a shame! you inust have mis- placed it," said Spicy. "No." And I made a careful exam- ination. "It is positively not here." "How annoying! I want to know what happened next. If it wasn't just about ghost-time I would go spooking back into that queer closet and see if I could find it." "You've quieted your conscience, then, in regard to the right and wrong of the thing-" "No, indeed I have not. I am con- vinced, as I told you before, that we shall both be sorry some day for what we have done. But my curiosity is up, and that is my strongest point, you know. Besides, from the very first moment that I laid my eyes on them, it has just seemed as if those old letters had some- thing to do with mo. You needn't laugh. I feel as solemn as Deacon Par- son's widow about it; and the notion sticks to me too." There was a knock at the door. It was Maggie. She had come to say that Miss Spicy's room was ready. We both started up and went at once to see it. It was on the opposite side of the hall from   where we were, and over the library. It had an arched ceiling, which was tinted somewhat gorgeously, a continuation of the bay window with a reef taken at each side, and several small niches in the walls. The carpet was down and the bed was made; and Spicy's trunks had been brought up. "It looks as if I had always lived here," said Spicy. "I wonder that per- son didn't unpack for me, she seems to have done every thing else! Meddie, I am growing courageous-let's go and hunt for that lost leaf." "Oh, no, not to-night. There is no gas in the closet, and I slouldn't like to take a candle in there, even if I had one, which I dare say I have not." "I know! you are afraid!" "Nonsense! you know better. I am entirely too practical." "Meddie, do you remember that bur- lesque concert we once attended in Mau- mee City, Ohio?" "Yes. Why?" "Don't you know how every man out of twelve declared he wasn't afraid of ghosts?  "Well, what of it?" "Sure enough, what of it? Why, when the ghost really came, the whole kit-and-dig of them lost their wits and scampered in every direction." "You talk as if there was a ghost coming here. I have no doubt I should quake if I stood face to face with one. But what is the use in wasting our breath on the subject when there is not such a thing as a ghost in existence!" "May be not," pronounced with a dubious inflection. "So we shall have to wait till morning to find out how the   minister made love! Oh, dear me I then I'll go to bed. Of course the lovely be- ing took care of him, and consoled him, and he said all the sweet things in the English language to her, and there was. an engagement, and a diamond ring, and a wedding -" "You forget that he was courting another lady, the one to whom this con- fession was made," I interrupted her to say. Spicy had dropped into a little cane rocker, and was pulling off one of her boots. She looked up, with a half-comi- cal expression, resting upon her pretty face: "Then Ida Everett must have jilted him." I was standing with my back toward the door, which was wide open, and from the glass opposite I caught a glimpse of Nursy Brown, with baby in her arms, flitting from it, or perhaps by it; and, supposing she had come to speak to me about some household matter, I stepped out into the hall and saw her going into the blao room, to which I followed her. "I have prepared the front chamber for you," she said, " thinking this would be a more quiet place to leave little Bright while we are pounding and prowling about and nailing down carpets. I dare say you are tired enough to sleep any- where, but he might wake and cry." "Very true." I stepped to the bed and opened it for her, and, after the little lump was depos- ited, I tucked him in and dropped a few kisses on his neck and arms. "It is at the end of the hall," said Nursy Brown, as, with my hat in my hand and my shawl thrown across my arm, I started for my new quarters.   It was the largest room on the second floor, and all my best bedroom furniture was there. It seemed so natural to have every thing in its proper place that I took it as a matter of course, and con- gratulated myself upon my orderly brain. That is, I knew very well that I had had no hand in settling things so speedily, but it was certainly creditable to me indi- rectly for keeping such efficient help. I was soon sleeping soundly, and the night was wearing away. aIving no care over the p1roceedings below stairs, I heard none of the noise and conmmotion. Nursy Brown had hired two or three ex- tra hands on her own responsibility, and was pushing things into their places with a spirit and determination wiich were conlmmendable, to say the least. It was four o'clock, as I afterward learned, when she went up-stairs to lie down. Myra and Maggie thought it would not pay for them "to go aLnd undress just for two hours," so sat down in the kitchen and laid their heads on the table. They said they had not been asleep, although I took their assertions for what tley seemed worth, wlen they heard a pierc- ing scream and a heavy fill nearly over their heads. They both ran up-stairs and found Nursy Brown lying upon the floor, apparently dead. CHAPTER IV. THE SINGULAR APPARITION. I SPRANG to my feet at the first call, and, without stopping to throw even a shawl about me, ran to the blue room. If I had any definite ideas or fears it was that something had happened to my ba-  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7037-00000016"/> by. But he was sweetly sleeping on his pillow, happily unconscious of what was going on around him. It took me several seconds to recognize Nursy Brown as she lay stretched like a corpse before the bed. Her unbecoming cap and net had both been displaced when she fell, and a large quantity of rich brown hair had fallen from its close confinement. Her forehead, which I had never before seen, was classic, and all her features finely chiselled. ier hand, too, attracted my attention, it was so delicately small, and clinched fast within it was one of the let- ters with which we had been amusing ourselves during the evening, and which I had left scattered about in the room, I knelt down by her and tried to raise her head with my hands. I blew in her face and screamed for the camphor bottle. Maggie, half-bewildered, tried to find it, and came running with a bottle of shoc-blacking. Myra arrived about the same time with a tumbler of cold water, and I dashed it into the pale face. She rallied, caught her breath, and languidly opened her eyes. In a moment after she spoke: "Some one in there I " and her eyes directed mine toward the door of the wierd closet, which was slightly ajar. "Who?" "A woman! Oh, shut that door!" and she fainted quite -away the second time. I nearly drenched her with water, trying to restore her, and then with My- ra's and Maggie's help lifted her upon the bed. Meanwhile somebody closed that closet door I There was no one in the room but Nursy, Myra, Maggie, and myself, and neither of us was within   four feet of it. There was no window open through which a draft could have been guilty of. the act, and therefore I was led to believe that the place had an occupant. A sickening sensation came over me, and I could not see distinctly for a moment, although Vie gas was turned up so high that it roared. My next thought was of burglars, and I recovered my self-possession sufficiently to remem- ber that they were cowards as well as assassins, and, while they might look hard at one woman alone, 'they would scarcely attack four. "She was dressed in white," Nursy Brown said, as soon as she was able to speak again, " a sort of robe was thrown about her. She peered through the door a second time just as I began to tell you about it. I don't know why it should have affected me so, only that there was such a strange look in her eyes, and it all came so unexpectedly upon me." "Maybe it is. some of the old board- ers coming back by mistake," said Myra. "Why? did the folks keep boarders who lived here before us?" asked Maggie. "Jest a few for company, so the old. cook told me. She came for some aprons which she had left behind, while we were a movin' in yesterday. See! is it yesterday or to-day?" "It's to-morrow don't you see the shine in the east?" responded Maggie. My nerves were fast recovering their usual tone, and I mentally re- solved to make personal researches into the cause of the disturbance as the day advanced. Leaving Maggie and Myra in charge of Nursy Brown, I went to my room and dressed. My mind was full of   the strange occurrence, and I rejoiced that Spicy had not been wakened in the general excitement, as sho was so timid and impressible, her faith in the super- natural would certainly have been estab- lished beyond question. When I returned to the blue room Nursy Brown was sitting up, and her hair and cap were arranged as she usually wore them. It was light enough to see without the gas and the shutters were thrown open. Maggie had picked up tle loose letters and laid them in a chair, and Myra had gone down stairs to kindle the kitchen fire. I took a seat and questioned Nursy somewhat further about the apparition, but elicited no new facts. She seemed greatly distressed at having caused such a commlotion, and seemed wholly mysti- fied in regard to our singular visitor. "Come, Maggie," I said, starting up and approaching the closet door, "let's see who's in there." "Oh, no! no! I couldn't look in there  I should fall dead-indeed I should! Don't make me!" and she turned very white. I had forgotten how provcrbially su- perstitious Irish servants are, or I should not have asked her. "Never mind, I can go alone." I  had my hand already on the door. "I'll follow you," said Nursy Brown, rising with much difficulty.  "By no means, you must keep quiet," I I said, taking hold of her and compelling c her to sit down again. "Nobody is go- t ing to hurt me at this hour of the day. I If they should attempt it, Maggie can put  her head out of the window and scream i for help;" and I laughed, although I did t   not see any thing especially funny to laugh at just then. "Wat, waitt, let me call Myra. She isn't so bad of fear ais mel," exclaimed Maggie, running out of the room and down-stairs. I was not sorry for tHe delay. It gave me time to rcimthrce my bravery, which was sadly on the wane. Who knew but there were concealed demons in that out-of-thc-way place! I had read of haunted houses, and trance speak- ing, and automatic writing, and of the introduction of flowers and fruits into closed rooms, of voices in the air, and visions of the human body. I had al- ways persistently laughed at the whole subject, but ridicule could not materially affect the actual state of tlings whatever they might be. No good tIling, or great thing, in this world, was ever accepted or believed in at once. Christianity was not, the existence of a western continent was not, the use and power of electricity or steam were not; wmlatever was op- posed to the experience of tleo vast ma- jority of mankinid was commonly reject- ed as incredible. But whiy argue? I was not going to harbor any hallucina- tion. No, not T. My lhouse must be redeemed from the shadow of a suspi- cion. I myself would march to the fiont or perish in the attemplt. Myra came up, but I could see that she had done it much against her will. Both of the servants looked anxious and careworn, and remained standing near the entrance to the blue room. I sum- moned my strength for a final struggle, gave the dreaded door a nervous push, it yielded, creaked a little and flew back to the very wall. Tllere was nobody to  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7037-00000017"/> be seen, and there was no appearance of anybody's having been in the closet since Spicy and I left it the night before. After staring until my eyes ached, I wheeled about suddenly, and nearly over- turned my three companions, who, stand- ing on tiptoe behind me, were looking over my shoulders. "Perhaps some one has entered and passed out of that window?" suggested Nursy Brown. I stepped down into the room and went and tried to open it. It was im- movable. Indeed, as far as I could dis- cover, there was no way of opening it. It was a little square sash with four panes of glass fitted into a plain pine casing. I was anxious to see what was below, and pressed my face in among the cobwebs to get a view. The slanting roof of the woodshed joined to the grape- arbor on the lower side stretched upward until within a foot of the window, so it would have been not only possible, but comparatively easy, for a person to have reached this point from the outside. But there was not the slightest evidence of its having been done. The ragged vines hung just wlhere they did yester- day, and the rubbish in the room lay on the floor in the same corner where we had poked it over. One magazine, in particular, was open where I had looked at a picture, then dropped it for some- thing else more interesting. Nursy Brown had sat down on the steps, and her face was a positive study, although I was not sufficiently gifted to read it without a teacher. Myra and Maggie looked at each other, looked into the empty room, looked at me, and breathed hard.   "What is all this rumpus about? Are you hunting for that letter so ear- ly?" asked Spicy, putting her head into the room, a head so ruffed and rumpled that it was quite apparent that she didn't take her hair off nights, as some ladies do. "Bless your heart, there's been a ghost- " "Hush"  It was Myra who vouchsafed the in- formation, and it was my peremptory order that interrupted her. "A ghost!" Spicy clinched her hands convulsively and her teeth chat- tered. "I told you so, Meddie!" "You told me?"I replied contempt- uously. "As for this ghost business, the least said about the better. I shall take measures to ferret out the secret, and until then I wish the subject dropped." The last two sentences were intended for my servants' ears, although I was looking at my sister. They left the room soon after and went in silence to their work. Nursy Brown was very weak, and I helped her to the bed, where she laid down beside baby. Convincing my- self that she needed nothing but rest and quiet, I threw my arm around Spicy, who was still in a violent nervous tremor, and led her back to her own room. She had learned so much already that I esteemed it the wisest course to give her a full his- tory of the night's scare. Indeed, I could do very little less, she was so per- sistent in her inquiries. I sat upon the side of her bed, and she stood before the bureau putting up her hair, and taking it down again. Once or twice she laughed hysterically, but upon the whole sur-   prised me amazingly by the manner in which she listened to my recital. "Only to think!" she went on to ,say, after I had finished, "what I was always most afraid of, I have come to at last Just like Susie Wharton. Her be- setting fear was of finding some one un- der her bed. All the while we roomed together at school she worried me to death ab outit, and, if she forgot to look under just the last tling before putting out the light, she would lie and quake and make me get up and do it for her. And sure as I live sle found a man there one iightl. It was after she went home, and it must have been a great satisfaction after looking for him so long! How I laughed when I heard of it  Now I must write to her and tell her about my ghost. I knew it would come, and upon tle whole I am ever so much relieved to think it is here." "Spicy 4crriman!" "Yes, dear, that is my name." "You are a perfect riddle! I never know what to make of you!" "Is that so? then you had better let me see what I can make of myself. I am sure of one thing-I can't make my hair crimp this morning without entirely too much trouble. So up it goes plain. There! how does that look?" "Very well." "How do you know? you are not ooking at it. Pray what are you thin-k- ing about? Is it the ghost still? I do wish I had seen it. Why didn't you call 1e 1 7 "The truth is, Spicy, if I had not seen that door closed myself without any visi- ble agency, I should suspect the whole a trick of the imagination.  Nursy 3   Brown was tired; she may have been asleep and waked suddenly; some jar on the street, or even on the railroad track, may have thrown the door open, and all the rest have been a distorted dream. The more I look upon it in that light, the more the theory gains foothold in my mind.  Otherwise, some person must have been secreted in the house for no good purpose, and made his escape in a way not yet revealed to our percep- tions." "You are matter-of-fact enough to kill a saint, Meddio. It is ever so much nicer to call it a ghost, and toll our friends the house is haunmted, and spirits of a highly-exceptional character are our daily visitors! and thus create an inter- esting sensation. Iad I better put on my blue mering or my gray empress cloth?" "Either. It don't  matter. We sha'n't go out or see company to-day." I began to feel sleepy, since there was no further occasion for energy and effort, and, pulling one of the pillows into posi- tion, fitted it to my head. When M3ag- gie came to summlon us to breakfast, an hour later, she found me in the apparent enjoyment of a comfortable morning nap, and Spicy would not allow her to wake Inc. An unusually loud ring at the front door bell roused me about ten o'clock. Spicy and Bright were sitting in the middle of the floor, engrossed in the con- tents of my jewelry-box. The little fel- low was ornamented from his head to his toes, and his incorrigible aunty was instructing him in the art of winding-up my watch. "One of the moving-men says it was  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7037-00000018"/> a bad bill you gave him yesterday, and will you please change it?" said Maggie, after coming into the room guardedly, to see if I was awake. "I did iot give him a two!"I said, taking it into my fingers and trying to recall the exact circumstances when I paid the man. "No, it was a ten, and a five, a ten and two fives, now-I have it, and he gave me back a two. I paid him for nine loads." "What shall I tell him?" asked Maggie. "That he is mistaken. He must have got it somewhere else. " A moment after I heard loud words in a man's voice, and Maggie's expostu- tulating tones. The next I knew, the rascal stood before me. "And is this the way you trate a poor working-man, to pay him in coun- terfeits I I'll have the ra-ul stuff afore I have the house, so be a forkin' it out." I rose to my feet and undertook to explain; but I was afraid of the man, for he seemed to be under the influence of liquor, and finally I retained the bill and gave him two dollars in gold. "And it was ontirely too chape we moved ye anyhow. Could ye be after giving me a little change for a glass of beer?" he went on as he wrapped the money up in a piece of dirty sheepskin. I caught his glittering eyes fixed upon my baby and his surroundings, and I trembled. It was a trifling thing in it- self, but I had occasion to remember it afterward. "Shall I call William to show this man the way down stairs?" exclaimed Spicy, springing up and coming forward, with her face very much flushed.   "No, you needn't ever mind about it now, miss. If you want to be so mane as not to pay your honest debts, lit it go, lit it go, I'll give it to ye;" and he blundered back the way he came, and we heard Maggie lock the door after him. "Well done, Spicy! What a brave girl am I How about your William?" and I laughed. "The old nuisance I I couldn't stand it any longer. How quick he budged when he thought we had a man among us I A house full of women are a help- less set anyhow, and if I were a robber or a thief, I should do just as they do, pounce upon every one I heard of. Say, Meddie I let's send for cousin Phil to come and sleep here, nights. I know he would just as soon, he never has to stay  at the bank evenings. He might have that little room at the head of the front stairs." "He could not have that room, for it is the best suited for Nursy Brown of any in the house, and I see she has all her things as well as baby's already in there. But if it is best to send for him, and 1 be- gin to think it is, I could put him in the blue room." "Capital I' said Spicy, "iAnd we won't tell him a thing about the ghost until he has tried it one night." "What's the use in telling him at all?"I asked. "Oh, there wouldn't be any fun in keeping it to ourselves all the while. May I write to him a note, or go for him?" "Neither. I will send Maggie. I want you to stay with Bright, for I sup- pose Nursy Brown is laid by, and my head is aching fearfully. I have had too much excitement."   I declined breakfast, went to my room and shut myself in alone. I dozed a little, but I was in toV much pain to get any sound sleep. Myra cameup with some tea about noon and kindly urged me to drink it, which I did, and felt much better for it. She didn't leave immediately, but stood first on one foot and then on the other, and finally wound her hands up in her apron. "I think I shall be goin' about the time my month is up," she at last stam- mered out. "Why so?"I asked, quietly. "Because my aunt is sick and wants me to come and stay with her a spell," she replied, looking at the carpet. "Oh, very well, Myra." It has been a principle of mine for many years to treat my servants well and pay them well, but never to ask them to stay with me after they have expressed a desire to go. Hnce, there was nothing more to be said on either side. Her month would not be up for a week yet, and I should have an abnn- dance of time to find some one else for the position. Spicy found me in the rock- ing-chair when she came up from lunch. My first inquiry was for Nursy Brown. "She is better, and won't let me have the baby any longer. She has sent for some oysters, and ordered Myra to cook them for you." "I don't care for them. I am not in the least hungry." "But you will be; you know what Owen Meredith says: '0 hour of all hours, the most blessed upon earth, Blessed hour of our dinners I The land of his birth; The face of his first love; the bills that he owes; The twaddle of friends, and the venom of foes;   The sermon he heard, when to church he last went; The money he borrowed, the money lie spent;- And many more things a man may forget, And not be the worse for forgetting: but yet Never, never, oh. never I Earth's luckiest sinner Hath unpunished forgotten the hour of his dinner I ' That is what I call practical sentiment, Meddie.  It says something  more, I don't quite remember how    it comes in, about, 'Indigestion, that conscience of every bad stomach, Relentlessly gnawing and pursuing with somle ache, and then another pretty idea: 'We may live without poetry, music, and art; We may live without conscience, and live without heart; We may live without friends; we may live without books, But civilized man cannot live without cooks. He may live without books-what is knowledge but grieving? He may live without hope-what is hope but deceiv- ine? He may live without love, what is passion but pining? But where is the man that can live witlout dining? ' I suppose it will apply to wonman just as well, only I don't quite subscribe to tle idea that a man, or woman either, could live very long without love." "You have managed to exist a little over sixteen   years without it, haven't you?" "Not a bit of it   don't I love you, and -  well, I might get up a book on statistics; but there come   your oys- ters! let them  shut your mouth, and don't bother nm." "How would you like to read to me for awhile?" I asked, as I submlitted to the temptation in my way and found lmy appetite increasing fist. "That is just what I am dying to do. I am at your individual service.   I have those letters in my pocket, and although I have hunted high and low, and cannot find the remainder of the one you were reading last night, I've struck another  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7037-00000019"/> mine, and it is the grand sequel I Pray listen with all your ears." She changed her seat so as to get a better light upon the close writing, and read as follows: CHAPTER V. THE MNISTER AND HS DEACON. "MY DEAREST HELEN: "The history of an unspoken love is, at the best, a spiritless feast, and it is only to correct false impressions that I have entered so minutely into particu- lars. Now I will give you a better sea- soned dish. "It was on a sultry June evening that I stood on the steps of my little church in Peculiarville waiting for Dea- con Wilder, who usually walked up the street with mo from the prayer-meeting. He came bustling along presently, slip- ped his arm through mine, and we pro- ceeded leisurely on our way. "'Where do you propose spending your vacation?' he asked, in a confiden- tial undertone. "'I am haunted by the blue hills of Massachusetts,' I replied. 'I have not seen them for two years. It is my pres- ent intention to visit a sister who has a cosy nest in among their fastnesses.' "' It is very cloudy, very cloudy this evening,' remarked my companion, with the air of a man whose thoughts were on some other subject. "'Yes, deacon. I approlhend showers before morning.' "'H-o-e-e-m, yes, very. H-e-e-e-m, by-the-way, Brother Gildersleeve, have you ever considered-h-e-e-e-nm--how-   hem-how much more useful a young man-h-e-e-e-m-of your cloth might be in our parish if-h-e-e-e-m-if you were to take to yourself a good, pious, exem- plary wife ' "This was hardly what I expected from him. I smiled, and looked full in his face. "'Excuse me-h-e-e-e-m-I have a slight cold this evening. It was only our great regard for you that made us talk this. matter over-h-e-e-e-m-a few of us, and I was appointed-h-e-e-m- to call your attention to the subject. There is no one in our little place whom we could select-h-e-e-e--m-as a suit- able companion for you; but-h--e-e-e-m -Deacon Tomilson's wife's niece is com- ing to visit them, and we should very much like to have you make her ac- quaintance.' "Thank you, sir,' was My quick re- sponse; 'but I have no disposition to marry-none whatever. Say so to my kind friends. If you wish to install a minister's wife over the Church, I will abdicate any moment you may desire, and thus give you an opportunity.' "My impetuosity must have aston- ished the good man. He stammered in his attempt to apologize. I camo boldly to the rescue. "'I fully appreciate your motives, Brother Wilder. Such thoughtfulness is eminently characteristic of my warm- hearted and zealous supporters. Matri- mony, however, is a subject upon which I rarely permit any one to speak to me seriously. I received a bruise in my younger years which has never had time to heal. I always expect to labor single- handed in the vineyard of the Lord.'   "'Then I suppose-lh--e-e-m-that I must report the failure of a bungling ambassador,' said Deacon Wilder, shak- ing my hand warmly and bidding me good-night. "And he did. Not only that, but his wife whispered the news, that Mr. Gil- dersleeve had been crossed in love, to every lady member of my church and congregation, and that lhe had positively declined to make the acquaintance of Miss Helen. Hortense. You were en- tirely innocent of any part in the plot, and might have been spared their idle tattle. But, as it id, you shall have the whole romance, and then execute judg- ment. "The following week, on Tuesday, I found myself one cloudy afternoon stand- ing on the little platform of the station- house at Clover Glen. It had grown into quite a pretty village since I was last that way. Paper-mills, woollen- mills, balmoral-mills, cotton-mills, warp- mills, and other kindred establishments, were flourishing in every direction. Two or three churches had gone up like sky- rockets, and cottages, large and small, and white and brown, and Gothic and plain, were scattered without regard to streets,' wherever there was a good place to build." "I suppose," said Spicy, pausing and looking up at me, "that they laid out tlbe stroets f') suit the houses, as I once bought my dress to match my gloves." Then she read on: "Tlere were pretty yards tastefully cultivated, and plenty of yards unculti- vated, simply serving as pens to catch the dirt in, and there were mountains set up all about like a wall of protection   against the wiles of the wicked world and the fresh summer breezes. "With my valise in my hand I walked leisurely up the main street, hunting for a house with two wings, as the residence of my sister Phebe had been described to me. All at once a hand was laid upon my arm, and a voice exclaimed: "' Grandison I by Jove! How came you here?' "It was my brother Fred, my junior some four years, as I presume you anre already aware. le gave me half-a-dozen slaps on the shoulder, and shook my hand until the joints cracked like castanets. "'By rail-and you? I thought you were coining gold on Wall Street I am proud to hear that yoe are developing quite a remarkable talent for business. How is Phebe?' "'Tip-top. Why didn't you announce your coming? She would have killed the fatted calf if she had known it. As it, is, she has nearly killed herself getting ready to engineer a pleasure excursion to Gray Lock to-morrow. We start at five o'clock in the morning.' "'I intended to have written, but I was uncertain a)bout the date of starting until the last minute. However, I am agreeable to Gray Lock, if you will take me along. I should like that trip above the clouds; it will remind mo of by- gones.' "We had by this time reached the house, and I was received by Phlebe most affectionately. Her home was a little gem of comfort. I had not seen anotler such since dear old Rockland Place pass- ed out of our family possession. She was 'blooming as a rose, and emanated sun- shine whichever way she turned.  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7037-00000020"/> "' Wliat a windfall you are, Grand- ison, just at this particular time!' she said. "'Which, interpreted, is to say, that, as soon as circumstances will permit, she will be much obliged to these two mem- bers of the masculine persuasion if they will walk into the kitchen and help her make sandwiches until sunset,' remarked Fred. "' No, indeed I' "'Yes, indeedl What is the use in denying it? You kPow you sent me to the grocery for some tongues a fbort time ago, and ordered me to make all possible haste, because, you said, there would be hardly time to get every thing ready to- night anyhow. I am not going to spoil a story for the sake of a minister.. Be- sides, lie is old enough and big enough to work, and your old adage applies in his case--" a certain amount of misery is necessary for the enjoyment of life."' "I immediately expressed my extreme willingness to cut meat, butter broad, pack chicken, or eat cake, as the master of ceremonies should direct. "The master is a mistress,' said Fred., "I corrected myself accordingly. "Phebo declared the picnic was of no such vital consequence. She wanted to sit down and talk with me. But Fred wouldn't let her. i' Business first, and then pleasure,' he said. 'When one is in an official position ho must face his obligations. Such honors are cheap at that.' "The facts of the case were that Phebe, and one or two young lady friends, had projected the expedition, intending that it should occupy two   days, remaining on the mountain all night in order to see the sun rise. About seventy of the villagers were enlisted, and a party from Williamstown were to join them on the mountain. Each in- dividual was expected to carry a basket; and for the general dinner and breakfast supplies were sent to Phebe's kitchen, and some colored men had been hired to carry them up on their backs. "Fred was in his element. Nothing ever suited him half so well as a frolic. He was a handsome young man of the world, prided himself upon his fine fore- head, brown wavy hair, and bewitching eyes; was tall, well built, a perfect ath- lete in his movements, and having earned the unenviable reputation of lady-killer, was nothing lotl to play a few pranks for the benefit of the country damsels whom he might meet on this eventful occasion. he was the most helpful of helps during the afternoon and evening, and laid the good things into baskets ac- cording to the latest prescribed rule. I stood by and did the looking on, and en- couraged Phebe to let those who would work do the work. 1Her husband, Rich- ard Haywood, arrived from Boston on the eight-o'clock train, and entered into the arrangements with great spirit. Some young ladies came in to discuss questions of policy and performance, and loitered long enough to flirt a little with Fred. I heard him wickedly suggesting to one of them to try to catch that red-headed old bachelor,' meaning your humble ser vant. "'So you have commenced making game of me already? ' remarked, after they had gone. "' Who ever knew a Gildersleeve who   could not fight his own battles? was all I got in reply. "The morning was fair, and the pro- cession was under way at the appointed hour. I was not more thanl half awake when wo took our seats at Phebe's break- fast-table, but I  relmember  distinctly every good thing upon it-coffee, hot rolls, fried ham, and cold mush. I com- plained of a fair appetite, considering the hour. The truth is, I am an advocate of sleep. IMy advice to young people (of all ages) is, to get all they can. Never mind that old-fashioned doctrine about early rising: 'Thomson, who sung about the seasons, said It was a glorious thing to rise in season; But then he s:aid it-lying-in his bed At ten A.

'There are just six of us of- ficers, and as the vehicle has three seats, then, according to Colbourn, we lmust ride two on a seat. Dear Mrs. Ilaywood, Ilay I have the felicity of riding by your side?'         / "I fancied there was more than one pang of disappointment when the sister thus carried off the starof the morning; but I made my best bow and handed in Miss Emily Juniper, lwho maintained great dignity in her gold-bowed glasses and faded hair. Brother Richard had a nice sociable time on the front seat with Knty Sparkle.   "'Tie road was dusty and rough, and mostly up-hill. We stopped every few minutes to let the other wagons overtake us. At a pair of bars opening into a lleak pasture we alighted, and sent the wagons back to the village. From there we walked a good half-mile to the foot of the lnodest old mountain, the highest in the Bay State, and which needs but a Bryant or a Bierstadt to render it fit- inous. nllOUS. "Meanwhile the sun was high enough in the heavens to pour down its scorch- ing rays. There is a remarikable spring just as we enter the woods, and we all stopped to drink and fill our canteens. Fron that point the ascent was toilsome, and befor we were half way to the s1um- mit our water failed and we were neairly famished with thirst. There were cov- etous eyes fixed upon some tin pails which formed a part of the luggagen , and, at one place whero we stopped to rest, there was a mysterious silence prevail- ingt for a time among the gentleimlen. All at once the startling rumor floated through the air that the pails contained nothing. "There was a panic, to which the re- cent stir in Wall Street was a mere bub- ble. The lady managers of the dinner looked at each other in hopeless despair. "'What shall we do ' exclaicmed Katy Sparkle, pulling off one of her green-kid gloves and pushing back ler flaxen ringlets with her bare hand. "'Is it possible! no milk at all for our tea and coffee I ' ejaculated Miss Emily Juniper, looking over her glasses. "' We had a six-quart pail of pure creanm! said Phebe, regarding me with interest as I martyrized myself by car-  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7037-00000021"/> rying two waterproofs, three parasols, a pair of overshoes, and a cane. "'Welll It is what I call a little worse than stealing sheep ' remarked Richard, as he worried along under the weight of a folded tent. "' I wish I knew who did it I ' whis- pered Mrs. Cady to Mrs. Puttywell. "'So do I! It is mean contempti- bleI despicable! selfish! sneaky'! outra- geous Mrs. iHaywood went all over the village to collect it, and I put in every bit I took from yesterday's milk. I wish I could just get hold of the person who dared to steal it 1' said the latter in an emphatic manner. "What is up ' cried Fred, overtak- ing us. "Katy Sparkle explained. "'I thought as much,' ho replied. "I saw brother Grandison drawing his head out of something very like a tin pail. I heard you talking rather loud up here ahead of me, and, thinking I could shed a little light on the subject, I put to the rescue. Say, look a here, manl' and he confronted me, taking hold of my coat-collar on either side of my neck and nearly shaking my wits into next week, 'What did you drink that milk for?

'What did you drink that milk for?' "' Because I did not know any better.' "What had I said  How could I have been so absurdly stupid as to con- fess to the doing of such a deed I Could   I recall my unfortunate words? Should I be believed if I did recall them?' "Come this way,' said  Richard shortly after. 'There are some Pitts- field ladies to whom I should like to in- troduce you.' "t I was glad of an escape from an em- barrassing predicament, and followed him at once. Imagine my confusion when he presented me, with all due formality, as ' the man who drank the milk! ' "I scarcely heard my true name again that day. My two brothers had an endless amount of fun at my expense. After reaching the top of the mountain we rested ourselves for a season on the soft side of flat rocks, and then the more active and ambitious of the party made preparations for dinner. A fire was built, water prestidigitated by the col- ored boys, tea -and coffee made, and sun- dry bits of cooking done. I amused my- self with a small telescope, tracing out the White Mountains in the distance, Mount Monadnock to the right, the Cats- kill and Adirondacks to the broad left, and bills upon hills, picturesque valleys, and gleaming lakes in the immediate foreground. "It was four o'clock I'. M. when I was escorted to a tent and placed at the head of a sumptuous repast, Turk fash- ion. Fred was high clief waiter, and a bevy of pretty girls followed in his wake. Everybody was in a merry mood, and the good things disappeared swiftly. I was favored with some strong black tea which I could not drink without my usual trimmings, and the first I knew I was laid violent hands upon, and the vile stuff was poured down m throat as if I were a small child sick with the measles   and would not take my medicine. Then, I was toasted as the man who drank7 tle milk, and was obliged to respond with a speech. I was pestered, and persecuted, and laughed at. But, strange as it may seem, the ladies ceased to regard my crime with horror and aversion and vied with each other in thilr kind attentions to me as the affair obtained publicity. "' Were you accustomed to drinking milk in your boyhood?' asked Mrs. Put- tywell, withl an expressio 1 of great in- terest on her face. "'Yes, I was brught up on a farm.' "'That accounts for it, then-your liking for it now. "But I can't see how you could manage to drink so muchl ' "Neither could Katy Splarkle, nor Mrs. Cady, nor Miss Emily Juniper. The latter looked concerrcd, and asked me twice if I was quite well. "' tabit, habit,' said Richard; 'if h1 had only had a Rev. fMrs. Grandison to have gone through life with hin, he would never have got in such a way.' "'Nor worn that happy and serene look and leghorn hat,' said Fred, flour- ishing his black beaver. "It was my turn to speak after a while, and I challenged Fred for a story. He was a capital story-teller. "' Won't do it unless you will answer a question which I am going to pro- pound.' "'What is it?' "'Why have you never married?' "'For two reasons-both good ones. Because I had an idea that I shouldn't like to see my wife make a beefsteak answer for two meals, use the fragments for soup the third day, and manufacture hash out of the remains all the rest of the week,   and my parish never voted me salary enough to provide more liberally. And, secondly and lastly, I have not succeeded in finding the lady who had the three qualifications I require.' "'Only three! Pray do tell us what they ar! ' cried Katy Sparkle. "' Good sense, good humor, and good health.' "'What a combination of excellen- ces! ' said Richard. " No wonder he is a single man!' said Fred. "'Not even an eye for beauty I all, Grandison I' said Phlbe. "' Fulfil your part of the programme now,' I said, addressing Fred. "We made him stand on a stone to entertain the comDany. He did so, andL his humorous description of a recent robbery was very enjoyalle. A gang of desperadoes had planned and exeelltel an assault upon some unprotected prop- erty, and so successfully had it been ac- complished under the very eyes of a crowd of people, that the offence rested only upon the head of one man, and, he innocent! "'Brother Grandison! ' said he, in conclusion, ' since you llve had the credit of the sin and none of the cream, I must admonish you, in the presence of all these witnesses, to remember the good Dog Tray.' "In the midst of the laughter that followed, we saw the Williamstown party coming over the brow of the hill from the west. A committee went forward to greet them, and there was quite a stir all round.

I returned to my telescope and sermonized a little. "A lady and gentleman, sauntering along, stopped directly in front of me. The latter was a scholarly-looking man, advanced in years, with snowy hair and a gold-headed cane. The lady was young, of a light, graceful figure and stylish air. I could see only a portion of her face, which was of marble whiteness, but there was a world of quiet strength in the curves oflier well-shaped mouth. She wore a gray travelling-dress of some summer fabric unrelieved by even a bow of bright ribbon. She was saying to her companion: "' With trouble we acquire strength, uncle. I am equal to any course of ac- tion which my better judgment approves. I have not yet had time-' "' She turned partly round at that mo- ment, and the words seemed to freeze to her lips. I1er eyes were riveted upon me!  And mine?

Looking into her eyes and seeing myself mirrored there, all my doubts and misgivings van- ished. It was a brief, blessed inter- change of soul with soul. Why, oh, why had I been so foolishy false to the promptings of my heart in those far back days? Why had I housed up the love that wellnigh consumed me, let the golden hour of promise pass, suppressed   the longing cry that was on my lips, and erected a barrier of ice over all my finer and better feelings? Inexplicable folly! I might have known that she was mine, and captured the flying years. It was perfectly clear to me now. IHow could I have been so mistaken, so misguided? Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when the soul is kneeling, no matter what the attitude of the body may be. Ali I my love was taking shape and form, and I took her outstretched hand. "She introduced me to her uncle, Judge Shubill, and we chattered pleas- antly, all three of us. Phebe coming that way, was thrown into a great state of rejoicing by meeting the dear friend of her girlhood, whom she had not seen since she graduated. Richard following, was introduced, and joined our party, but Fred was more agreeably occupied elsewhere. We found seats on the rocks and settled ourselves for a talk. We ex- humned Rockland Place and painted it up in fresh colors. We wandered through the fields and meadows and picked clo- ver-blossoms and dandelions. We visited North Pond, that unique body of water on the top of a high hill, and picked huckleberries in a row-boat. We took drives after the horse that always shied af white paper, and had two or three upsets in rough places by way of a remi- niscence. We dissected the good people of the neighborhood, laughed over Mrs. Cook and the captain, and the post-mas- ter and his wife, and went to church on. Sundays, and held full-dress receptions while the congregation gathered. Sadly and tenderly were spoken the names of Ty father and mother, and loving allu-    sions made to their many virtues and ac- complishments, and their better home in the spirit-world. Kind words! Heaven- born immortalities Their influence is stamped upon the future when the past has sealed the lips which uttered them. Let them live on forever and forever! "Strange freak of fate which had thus thrown me into the magnetic lres- ence of the woman whose image I had been trying to tear from my heart for so many years! My ears were tingling once more with the music of the voice whichh lad taught me the lesson of life in a new rhythm! and oh, how greedily I caught every pearl whch fell from her lips! As in tloso early days she charmed by entering entirely into the moods of those about her, drawing fortl by her genial aDlreciation their best gifts, and rendering them entirely at home with themselves; as in her daily life then, so in her conversation now, she displayed singular sweetness of temper and forget- fulncss of sell, combined with fine intui- tive perceptions; and I, who had been grop)ing so stupidly in a labyrinth of er- ror, emerged into a mysterious alchemy of light, with newly-awakened percep- tions. I llad suddenly found myself in the attitude of a man impatiently wait- ing for the right moment when lie could do homage before the world to the wom- an of his choice. "Meanwhle another banquet had been preparing for the more recent coiners, and the judge and his niece were led away, promising to meet us again in the evening. Phebe had duties that re- quired her attention, and excused her- self, saying: "Richard, it is a good time for your   cigars while we are getting the tents spread and candles lighted.' "True,' and lie started to get them. "The boxes were not where they had been left. Ilo instituted a search which occupied some moments. Finally, somoe one spied them partly covered by thio leaves in a little hollow of earth. But the fine lbavanas which they had con- tained were not to be found. ' It is tlose darkeys,' he said, scowl- ing and shaking his liead. "They were sitting in a row under a little pine-troo a few rods below us, a)- parently absorbed in viewing the land- scape. He steppced lightly over the bank ard called out: "' Peter I' "Yes-er, and in the flash of an eye the boy stood up and faced about. "' Did you take my cigars?' "'Nos-er, never touched a cigar in my life.' "' WhatI don't you smoke? "'Nos-er, never sumoked a cigar in my life.' "'How is that? Don't you like ci- gars?' "'Don-nos-er, never lsmloked a ci- gar in my life.' "His hands were behind him, and at that instant a stream of fire shot up in the background and singed both his hands and his hair. He jumped into tho air with great, dilated eyes, and then wailed and agonized over his smarts. "'So you never smoked a cigar in your life, eh ' said Richard, with his eyes resting upon the poor stump of one which had done the mischief. "'Ohs-er, I'll never steal another ci- gar, never, as long as I live I Ohs-er, I'll  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7037-00000023"/> never steal another cigar I my hand I oh, my hand ' and he blew and shook the unlucky member. 'Ohs-er, I'll never steal another cigar as long as I live! ' '"We could none of us restrain our laughter, and the old mountain resounded with the uproar. The fire, meanwhile, which had kindled in the dry grass and stubble, crept along aided, by the wind, and assumed a serious aspect. There was no water to be had, consequently we did battle with stones, moss, and dirt, and in the end conquered.  But the moon was up and the wee small hours approaching when we buried the hatchet and smoked the pipe of peace once more. The laborers were served with refresh- ments by the ladies of the committee. One of the Williamstown ladies brought me a cup of coffee, and described something to me while I drank it, no doubt very interesting, but spoken in what seemed a lost language. I was thinking about Ida Everett, and wondering how I was going to get an opportunity of seeing her before the party retired to the tents. We were standing in front of one then, with its great blank black eye taking in every thing, and giving out nothing in return, save the dim length of vacant space. I looked at my watch by the light of a feeble lanp, which stood inside a pail. There are moments with rusty, broken locks, which refuse to open to the crowding joys that wait beyond. This was one.  I returned my cup with suitable acknowledgments. Then I reached up and cut a branch from one of the trees to keep off the musquitoes. I watched a shadow coming toward me -no, it was a form clear-cut and pres- ently distinct in outline. A faint rustle   of drapery, a light foot-fall, and then the words: "'OhI Mr. Gildersleevel I hardly knew you in the dark ' "I was intoxicated with delight. The hour longed :or qome at last I And with it the feeling--lhich all men know- that it was the one jewelled-opportunity which must not be allowed to escape. I offered her iry arm for a brief turn over the scarred, seamed rocks to the region of the late fi'e. There followed winged moments. I told her all. She tried to interrupt me, but I would not permit it. It was an earnest, sincere outpouring of the pent-up love of years. And I made her listen, listen to the end, although she let go my arm and sobbed convulsively. "In the I'ght of the new moon, which was shining over my shoulders and fill in her face, I stood with folded arms waiting her reply. I could see pity flash from her drowned eyes, and then a hot carnation scorch up the tears from her cheeks. Twice she essayed to speak, and hesitated, painfully; then, gathering strength and growing calmn and cold in her demeanor, and planting each word like a sword thrust through my heart, she said: "'Of course you are ignorant of the facts-how could you know them?  I have been married two years I ' "In order, I suppose, to relieve me from any further embarrassment she abruptly badet me good-night. I never saw her again. I hardly know how the hours were passed until we returned to Clover Glen. I remember but indis- tinctly the surprise and regrets of my sister and brothers when I announced my intention of going to Europe for a   six or eight weeks' trip. They knew nothing of the pain I was seeking to dislodge. "I cannot tell how long it was bo- fore I was able to say: Welcome, disap- pointmentI thy hand is cold and hard, but it is the hand of a friend! I have taken sorrow to my heart, made it a part of me, and nourished it until it has made me strong again. The setting of a great hope is like the setting of the sun. But the brightness of life is not gone. There is darkness for a season, and then light illumines the eastern horizon and we live again. "I was sitting in my room before a bright, blazing fire in the hotel of the Piazza del Popolo at the foot of the Pincian Iill in the Eternal City, when the letter of Deacon Tomilson, enclosing your picture, reached me. I glanced at the strange Italian fireplace which al- lowed so much heat to escape up the chimney; at the curious andirons- miniature sphinxes crouched with serene faces amid the flames; at the ceiling, with its half-classic, half-grotesque fres- coes, and at the water-basin and pitcher set in a frame resting on a tripod, while my thoughts went back to sacrificial fires. Then I studied the pretty, inter- esting face on the card before me, and evil whisperings in my ears suggested sacrificial fires. "That night my pen traced the few lines that set afloat the rumor that I was about to resign my charge in Peculiar- ville. If to return was to meet you, I felt that I could not return there. But gradually I became more self-contained; change of scene, as well as time, con- duced to the. restoration of both mental   and bodily health, and when the earnest appeals of an attached people reached meo on my homleward voyage, I had no lan- guage at command wherewith to refuse. "We met, dealr Helen, and I have learned your worth. The future is in your hands. My heart is all laid bare. I have kept nothing back. Perha,1ps we shall yet discover that between a perfect friendship and a perfect love there is a fainter distinction than many peolelc imagine. May you be guided in all wis- doml and may Hoaven's choicest bless- ings rest upon your liead, is the sincere prayer of          G. G. " CHAPTER VI. SPICY'S DISAPPOINTMENT. "I WOULD like to wring that man's neck " said Spicy, throwing down the letter impatiently. "Why so? the matter seems to have regulated itself as such matters do, and, while there was much to bo regretted, I don't see that, under the circumstances, there was any thing that could be helped. If the lady Helen saw fit to take him, I have no doubt he made her a good hus- band." "Ohl, dear, yes; I .slppose likely, beo- ing as- 'It is man's philosophy When woman is untrue, The loss of one but teaches him To make another do.' but he no need to hIave been so un- reasonably selfish as to hlave wasted all this immense pile of French paper talk- ing about his own love-affairs, and drop- ped his brother Fred like a hot potato I I was just getting interested in the young man, and never stopped reading when I  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7037-00000024"/> got hoarse and my eyes smarted, because I thought I was going to get another full-length view of himl My heart is dead broke " "It is too bad I Perhaps you will find something of him in the other let- ters." "No, I guess not. I am in total de- spair. They look like regular engage- ment missives from beginning to end. Here is something about a ring, and a little farther on they are going to the city to buy traps for house-keeping. They are coming back the same day, so Pecu- liarville isn't far from New York. Then they are going to have some new Vene- tian-shutters on the little white church, which is just beyond the covered bridge, and a new carpet for the minister's pew. But never a word about the glorious Fred I I wonder if he went to the wed- ding  I wonder if he does his nice brown hair up in curl-papers every night to make it wavy " "You must keep an eye out for him when you go to New York in the fall." "What advice for a sister to give! Me do such a thing as that! 'What do you suppose would become of me if I was to try it? I expect, as long as I am in Miss Gilbert's boarding-school, that I shall be required to shut my eyes every time I go in the street, and march with a teacher on each side of me. I like him though4s near as I can get at him. I must go ack and read it over, what his brother says." "Meanwhile I will go down-stairs and inspect my whereabouts, for I am like a stranger in a strange land. I have given the subject so little attention." "Your head is better, is it?"   "Yes, indeed. I aml almost as good as new." I went to the parlor first, a square room with a large window on each of three sides, and was not a little surprised to find it in perfect order. The carpet was my old medallion, and must have fitted pretty well, save a portion cut from the length. The piano stood " on the bias," as Spicy would say, across one corner of the room, and the large sofa was its Vis-d-vi in' the same position across the other. The easy(-chairs, and the tables, and the ornaments, were ar- ranged in the best possible good taste, and the effect was so inviting that I took a seat. The only incongruity that glared upon me in my pleased frame of mind was a plain iron gas-fixture with two arms, one of which pointed toward a sweet, pensive, mellow landscape in oil, by Inman, which hung over my elegant bronze clock on the mantel, and the other preserved a threatening attitude in the direction of the front window. The little entrance to the parlor from the street was an oblong space about four feet by six. A door opened from it also into the library, a snlller room than the parlor, and which conmmuni- cated with the latter by another door beyond the mantel. I found this look- ing even more attractive than the parlor, although it accommodated very much less furnitures. My books were lying on the floor in the curiously constructed bay-window recess, for the want of a case, otherwise every article had struck an attitude, and the grand whole was kindly suggestive of family circles and winter evenings. The dining-room was just beyond,   "all hunka-dori," Spicy had said, when I had asked her, in the morning, of its welfare and general appearance, and from it a door led into the great north hall, at the left of which was the kitch- en. I was particularly struck by the number of closets 'and pantries which burst upon me from  every nook, and corner, and turn, and which are of such immense use for storing surplus goods. I was not at all surprised either to find them filled, for I remembered my nine loads of yesterday. Nursy Brown was in the kitchen looking over the silver. She was pale, -very pale, and looked wan and weary. The faintest shadow of a smile played round her lips as she expressed the hope that I was better. I tried to put into proper plraseology my grateful ac- knowledgments to her for benefits re- ceived, but my words seemed meaning- less and fell, like dead weights, far be- low their aim. I believe I hinted at some possible reward for her valuable assistance in so many and unexpected ways; and then I wished I had not said any thing, for she was all at once in- vested in a halo of superiority -which I could not fathoml, and my remarks were evidently distasteful to her. She gazed through the window  with a strange, stunned quietude, a sort of dead apathy, and had the bearing of one upon whom fate had spent its last blow. I had never observed her so closely be- fore, or had this change come over her recently? I inquired after Bright, and found that ho was asleep. I discussed the fam- ily bill of fare, sent Maggie for Cousin Phil, and wrote some orders for the   butcher and the baker and the grocer. Then I examined the fastenings of the windows and doors, and at last visited the blue-room, to which I was followed by Nursy Brown. / "I have driven a nail into the win- dow-sash in the closet for additional security," she said, "althoughl it s1eems perfectly imlpregnable without it." "A wise precaution," I replied. "I wish we could fasten the closet door, too." But that was not so easy a matter. There seemed to be no good place for a lock, altlougl we found afterward tlat the putting of one on was not an im;pos- sibility. Nursy Brown quito agreed with me in thinking it best not to aDprise Cousin Phil of our strange experience of the previous night, but to be ready to run to I his aid should we hear the slight- est alarm. "Of course nothing will happen," I sail. Phil came about eigtht o'clock. He was a natty, lively fellow of two- and-twenty, of a tallish figure, quite stout and firmly built, and passed for a much older man than he really was. He had a fine voice whenever he chose to air it, and was admirablly educated on at least three musical instruments. Spicy opened the piano, and fresh, animated, and amiable, the two sang and played until I warned them that my hour had come for retiring, "I wish you would let In 1 sleep in your room," said Spicy, opelning my door a crack and whispering through it, just as I was ready for bed. "Come in. What is the matter?" "Nothing yet. But I think I could  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7037-00000025"/> entertain my ghost better if I was not quite alone. I am not the least bit bril- liant, you know, and you could nudge me with your elbow and whisper something in my ear to say, if my vocabulary failed." "Then you propose having an inter- view, Phil to the contrary notwithstand- ing." "That is my present expectation. So I may stay, may I Thank you. Now I am going to name my bedposts, and get into bed backwards without speaking a word, so as to have my dreams come to pass. See, bedpost number one shall be Fred Gildersleove; bedpost number two -well, I guess I will name it Fred Gil- dersleeve too; bedpost number three shall be Fred Gilderslceve to keep the others company, and bedpost number four shall be Fred Gilderslecve, to make the number even. Now, don't disturb me after I've said my prayers." I was greatly diverted by her ludi- crous endeavors to climb over the foot- board in the manner specified. And then I tried to induce her to break the mystic charm by answering some trivial ques- tions, but she turned her face to the wall and her silence was a success. I did not fall asleep readily. I heard the cars come in train after train, and people were driving on the avenue very late. The air was warm and sultry, un- usually so for that season of the year, and I heard an occasional rumble of thunder. It stormed at last. I could fe the wind jarring that part of the building which I occupied, and the rain beat against the windows. Then it sub- sided, but occasionally my room was il- lumined by a vivid flash of lightning,   and there were ominous roarings among the branches of the trees in the yard. Was that a step in the hall?-like some one blundering in the dark! My head was raised from my pillow, and my ears keenly alive. Somle one at my door! Yes; te latch was moving, stealthily moving- it creaked a little, for it was old and worn and unoiled. The door was opening slowly. It was too dark for me to see it, but I knew and felt it all the same. A white figure approached the bed. '"Who is that?"I had just barely strength to gasp. "Me, ma'am," was the prompt reply, and never was the broad Irish accent more acceptable to my cars. "Oh, Mrs. Belmiore, this is the dreadfulest house I ever seen I We shall all be murdered; there is ever so many robbers down stairs!" 't "What!-what do you say?" I sprang up in great alarm. "They've tried our window and got it wide open, and Myra and me both seen 'cem in the lightnin'. Then we seen another man before the glass window, when we was runnin' through the north hall, and there was a big rattle in the dinin'-room like as if there was a lot of 'cm in there. Myra has gone to hide in Nursy Brown's room, and I've come here." I was at the bureau by that time, and having drawn a match across the sand- paper we were relieved of the murky darkness, if nothing more. "Stay here, Maggie, and I will call Phil." I threw my wrapper about me and ran into the hall, but stopped to light the   gas there before I went on. Phil was sound asleep, and I knocked three times before I got an- "Ugh--ugh-what do you want?" "Please get up quick and come down stairs with me. There is somebody in tile house." I stepped along to Nursy Brown's door, and found the gas lighted and the baby awake. She was trying to quiet him, so I did not go in. At that mo- ment Phil put his head into the hall, with his hair standing up straight like a drove of porcuptine quills. "What is up, Meddie?" "That is what I want to find out. Make haste!" "I will be on hand in a second." I ran back to my room and brought a candle which I always kept there. "Got a sledge-hammer, or a pop-gun, or any thing dangerous?" he asked, as he sallied forth equipped even to his boots. "We will go down the north stairs," I said, ignoring his sarcasm. "I Wlat! You going with me to keep me from getting hurt?" "Yes, or for any other good reason you may be pleased to give." "So be it; but let me take the can- dle," and lie preceded me. In the centre of the kitchen lie stopped and faced about. "Meeddio, please tell me wlhat we are looking for?" I repeated the servant's story to him, and we went on through the laundry to their room, which opened out of it on the grounI-floor. Sure enough, the win- dow was open as Maggie had said, and the end of a broom-handle, cut to fit, supported it! 4   "They first put a knife up between the two sashes and sawed off thlo miser- able old fastening," said Phil, after exam- ining it carefully and closing the window, without seeming at all startled by the circumstance. "However, they must bo half way to Calumet by this time, so we needn't have any more fears to-night." I told him I should like to have a nail put in, but le found that the broom- handle would do just as well, being the same length as the upper sash, and rest- ing upon the top of the lower one so firmly that it could not bo moved. We went through the lower part of the house, which was 1mndisturbed, and we presumed the burglars, fi nding themn- selves discovered, lhid beat a retreat without making any furlthelr attempts to enter. Phil offered to sit up until morn- ing if I wished it, but it seemed quite unnecessary, and he went back to hs room. I stopped in to see Nursy Brown, who was lying very wlito and still be- side my bably, holding one of his little, pincushiony hands in her own. Myra was sitting in a high, straight-backed chair by the table, and looked as if sh was just about to set out for the gal- lows. I told them the result of our explora- tions and the conclusions to which we had arrived. Myra shook her head: "It is the dreadlfil house, ma'nm I It will kill me. I cannot stay anotler night, indeed I cannot. They's been all over it. I seen 'cm in the dining-room, and right up here in this very hall I put my hand on one when we was a creepin' away to save ourselves. He had a skin like a snake, and it was all greasy like, and his eyes rolled at me," and she put  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7037-00000026"/> both hands over her face and drew short, sharp breaths. Free as I have always been from su- perstitious fears, I sincerely believe that if Ihad heard that speech twenty min- utes sooner I never should have gone down-stairs. But, as it was, I had 1,een over the infested ground, and Was satis- fied that the wlole disturbance had pro- ceeded from natural causes. I tried to imbue Myra with my own opinions, but she was obdurate. "Them's no robbers," was the sum- ming up of her expressed belief. I went to my room and found tlat Spicy had not waked. Maggie, worn out with fatigue and loss of sleep, and proba- bly quite relieved from- any sense of dan- ger wlile under my immediate protection, had curled herself up on the floor, laid her headon a chair, and gone to the land of dreams also. I could hardly make up my mind to wake her and send her back to her room, scared and trembling as she would naturally be, under the circum- stances, so I let her remain until morn- ing. 1 got a little sleep with the gas shining full in my face, for I hadn't the courage to turn it out, but it was jn snatches and not at all to mlly satisfaction. Maggie went down quite early, soon after daylight, but I supllose she talked over the affairs of the night with Myra before she went about her morning work, as it was nearly eight o'clock when she went to the front-door to put out the mat and sweep off the stoop. The next moment she came running up- stairs, out of breath: "Mrs. Belmoreo Mrs. Belmore! The front-door has gone and been left open all-night!"   Did we look to that when we were running about the house? I strained my brain to remember. Surely not. We did not go into that little hall-entry at all. The robbers must have gone through the house and out that way. As soon as practicable I hurried down to learn particulars. Maggie told me how she found the door standing, and I traced large, muddy footprints on the floor of the painted veranda. "Poor fellows I they have had 'all their trouble for nothing! They. got frightened away before they had a chanco to steal any tlilTng!"I said. "They'll come back, I suppose," re- plied Maggie, with a mournful cadence. Something like a shriek caughtmy car at that moment, and I flew up the stairs much faster than I had descended them. The door of Spicy's room was standing open, and she in her night- clothes was holding to the latch for sup- port. I stood there too-for full five minutes without uttering an exclamation. The sight fairly struck me dumb. "Put on your clothes, deary. I want to call Phil to see this," was my first remlark. "I will go back to your room. I am sick," and, bursting into tears, Spicy dis- appeared. Nnrsy Brown came out of the nur- sery when I called Phil, and, as he had finished putting every particular hair in its proper place, he was ready to respond immediately. "Where's the show?" he called out. But it was not so far off that he need- ed a guide. Nursy Brown had already stepped into Spicy's room, and we fol- lowed closely in her wake.   "Ginger! that is rather roughll By Gcorge, what a knife! They were no myth -after all, were they, coz? Iave you found out what is gone?" No, I had not got so far. It had been sufficient for me until now to see what they had left. Tumbled bureau- drawers, wide open, the contents of overhauled trunks scattered here and there, chairs lying on their backs as if in consequence of a hasty exit, and a horri- ble knife several inches in length, and with two sharpened edges, standing up- right on'thc floor near the bed, wlhere it had, no doubt, been dropped acciden- tally I "I don't know what Spicy had to temlpt the miserable thieves-not much money at any rate!"I said, stepping a1ong11 and taking a mhore careful survey of her upper drawer. "Queer that they should have aimed for this roomI If thecy had fallen upon mine they would have got a better haul, or even down- stairs, where my silver is stored " "'What is this?" Phil was pulling something from un- der a pile of clothing on the floor. Alas! it was my jewelry-box, bottom upward, just as it had been thrown down and - empty! Spicy had brought it from my room yesterday morning to amuse the baby with, had thrown the treasures back into it carelessly and set it on a chair, and forgotten all about it as the other events of the day crowded themselves upon her notice. Poor child! Sho was sobbing most piteously upon my bed with her face buried in the pillow, when I went for her.   "Never mind dear, ar dony't feel so; come and toll us what you have lost," I said, kissing her. "What I have lost! it is what you have lost through mlly leedlessness that I care forI If I had put that box back where I got it, as I intended to do, or if I hadn't touched it in the first place, tlis would not have happened. 01l, Meddie! your beautiful watch tlat Leonardus ga ve you on your wedding-day, and those precious charms, the very grey- hound that the Pope blessed, and such a chain! I am sure there never was other like itI And your pearls, which I have always taken sucel pride in seeing you wear, and if there ever was one thing I wanted more than anotler it was to have just such a set for a bridal present; and your solitaire diamond, and the garnet set, and those buttons, the last gift of dear papa, and the rings which I taught little Bright to call stars, and he spoke it al- most as plain as I do this minute I , dear! dear! dear! it was all my fault! what shall I do! walt shall I do!" ' How do you know they are all gone? there has been no search made yet! Every thing is upside down in your room. Perhaps we shall find them, but you must conme and hell, because it is your things that are tumbled about," "It is no use. I feel it in my bones. The moment I looked in that door it all came to me. How that old scalaoway eyed the jewelry when hl was bothering about the bill, and how I did not have the sense to put it away I suppose the knife was to haveo done me if I had been there to make a noise! Oh, dear! dear! dear I sliould have deserved my fate; " and her distress vas not to-be soothed  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7037-00000027"/> by any words of mine just then. Mean- while Nursy Brown had gath-ered up Spicy's disturbed possessions and hunted in vain for the missing valuables. The robbers had got what they came for, and left all the rest. Spicy's dainty little watch was still under her pillow where she had put it before coming to my room the night before, but her pocket-book had been taken from her bureau. The only smile which lighted up her tear-stained face that day was when reference was made to the latter: "How they will bo sold I It has only ten cents in it I " There were a good many footprints in the soft earth on the garden side of the house, and upon close examination we determined that no less than three persons had been prowling about the premises during the night. The other end of the broom-handle was under the servants' window, where it had been cut off and thrown into the grass. "That huge old knife did good ser- vice," said Phil, as he picked up the evi- dence of its work. One of the men woe tracked through the north gate of the grounds, and an- other through the front. Phil got a pair of scissors and a paper, and tried to take a pattern of the footprint of the latter. Heo succeeded partially, and sent Maggie up to Spicy with it to inquire what Am- ber she thought that man wore for a boot I Then he seemed to be following a trail through the rear part of the yard, and came back quite excited. "It is a woman's foot as sure as you live I " I could hardly credit the statement, but in one place near the grape-arbor   the impression was perfect, and I was of the same opinion as soon as my eyes rested upon it. And a very delicate lit- tle foot it must have been. "Here is where she climbed over the fence and escaped into the alley." "I must find out what it means. I will set detectives at work," I said, ex- citedly. It was long years, however, before I did find out what those woman foot- prints meant. Within an hlour the chief of police had all the details of the rob- bery, its possible bearings, and suspicious connections. I was convinced that my old moving man was at the bottom of it all. Yet the catching of him was quite another thing, since Maggie had picked him up that eventful May morning, on the corner of some street, she could not tell where, and of course nobody could tell whither he went. But the property was of such a nature, and could be so easily identified, that I had great hlopes of its being eventually recovered. I was philosophic and even cheerful under tle loss, for it might have been much more serious, I reasoned. I endeavored to comfort Spicy whenever I could find a moment to spare, who was blaming her- self continually, and declaring that she should never be willing to look Leonar- dus in the face again. Indeed, she reiter- ated all the old threadbare superstitions she had ever heard or read of in regard to the losing of wedding finery, and seemed to thnk she had conmlitted the unpardonable sin by being accessory to it. As a final resort, I turned her thoughts into a new channel by asking what she had dreamed about Fred Gil- dersleeve, after all her trouble.   "Bless your heart, I thought he turned up in the ghost-closet, out of the blue roomn I He was dressed in ridiculous short-clothes and knee-buckles  lieo shook his finger at me just as Paul Gib- bon used to do when he was superin- tendent and I did not behave in Sabbath- school, and said I should rue the day I ever touched those old letterst I tell you, Meddie, as I told you in the first -place, that they are certainly mixed up with my destiny somehow I I don't be- lieve it was right to find them I " "That is a new way of putting it. We found them by chance." "Well, then, I wish we had never mlloved here. There is a fata lity about the houso, I am sure I See how much has come to pass since day before yes- terday!" She-was going back upon the old sub- ject, and the tears were pouring. I in- sisted upon her dressing and practising over some new music, while I went out to hunt for a cook to fill Myra's place. "Can't you coax or hire her to stay until the end of her month, as she first talked of? Oh, she does make such nice apple-pies, I hate to have her go!" "I have my doubts about her ever having made an apple-pie in my house I " "Who has made them then?" "I suspect Nursy Brown has been the fairy who has coaxed our appetites to such an extraordinary degree. It is very stupid in me not to know any thing for certain, especially about what is going on under my own roof, but there never was any silch house-keeping or cooking before she0 came, and it has been so agreeable to me since that I have let it take its own course."   "I should give it all up to her and let her engage the new cook, then, if I was you." "Oh, nol I I must prelservo Iy dig- nity as the head of the family. Besides, I don't pay her any more wages than I should an ordinary nurse-girl, and, for that reason, I couldn't ask her to sloul- der any of my responsibilities. What she does of her own accord I appreciate, but I am actually afraid to off'or her any compensation for extra favors, lost she take offence and vanish out of my sight." "Slheo must do thngs for thlo very love of doing them, I should say, then," replied Spicy, as she bathed her eyes at the washbasin. "Afore likely to occupy her mind. I have known persons busy themselves in ways as uncongenial as possible, in order to dull the sharp edges of solme great sorrow, and I am beginning to think suche may boe the case with her." "' Have you got any room you would like me to sweep and dust?" asked Sli- cy, turning round suddenly, with her eyes full of soap, "because, since it is my special aversion, it might tend to ameliorate my misery." I laughecd, and stepped out to look over the balusters to see who ]1ad just rung the door-bell. It was one of the detectives in pursuit of additionall sernlip of information. I met hin in the parlor, and we talked a few minutes, closing the interview by entering into an agreement to have the house guarded for a night or two. Then I put on my hat and shawl and gloves, and went to the intelligence of- fice. thero wnre no cooks in; I never went there when there were any in. But  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7037-00000028"/> the woman in attendance, Mrs. Bates, promised to send me one before night. In accordance thereof, there was one reached my door before I did myself, a buxom, rosy-faced, well-dressed-in-pink- muslin Irishwoman of forty or more years. She had a good, but badly-spelled character, written on several separate and distinct slips of paper. She informed me that she had always lived in the very firstfamilies, and, as for her skill in the art of cookery, she knew how to do every thing " illegant." "When can you conme?" "I am come now, if you plase, ma'am." "I mean, to stay? Don't you want to go after your clothes?" "Ive got clothes on, ma'aam, as is good enough for anybody's house." "I thought they were too good to do your work in, and. presumed you had others?" So I has. But I can go for 'cm in the evening." "What is your name?" "Ann, if you plase, ma'am."  "Well, Ann, I lope you are not easily frightened, for we've been having robbers in the house."- "No, not at all, ma'am. They had 'em where I was last." "They got in through the window in tho-crvants' room, but I have taken measures to havo it made as secure as possible since." "Oh, I don't mind. They have often got into my windows.7" "You are probably not afraid of ghosts either?" I thought it best to sound her on every point. "-Not the least of a bit, ma'am." "And you are quite prepared to go   into the kitchen, and take off your bon- net and help get the dinner?" "I are." "Come this way, then." Myra was on her knees byAhe kitch- en stove, basting some chickens which were sizzling and sputtering in the oyvn. She rose to her feet, and confronted tle new-comer with flashing eyes. "Here is your successor," I said. "Take courage, you will not have to sleep in this dreadful house again." "Seems to me you are in a mighty hurry to get rid of mne! I ain't going to be sent off so " "You gave mc notice that you should leave to-day." "Bilt you needn't a been so glad like. It's morc'n flesh and blood can stand, wlhen I thought so much of the baby, and Miss Spicy, and General Bel- more, and have taken such an interest and worked so hard a-movin' I " "I ain sorry, Myra, but you have it as you wished. Please show Ann whllere the things are, and tell her all about the hobgoblins, and then come to my room and get your pay." Mnaggio was setting theo table in the dining-room. She was quite composed, not having been as terror-stricken at any time as Myra.  We learned afterward that she had had Inuch less occasion, for Myra, in trying to find Nursy Brown's door, had run straight into the arms of one of the midnight marauders. "You will get more thlan you want '- of that cook-woman  aforo you get through with her!" were Myra's last words to me, as shhe shrugged her shoul- ders with- a dubious insinuation. That night passed quietly, and each.   member of the fiamily rose next morning greatly refrshed. 'Phil had cracked a good many jokes over the police guard, told me that lightning was never known to strike twice in the same place; but, upon the whole, I think hie was glad of the arrangement. Spicy was late to breakfast, and, when I sent out for an instalment of hot rolls and coffee, I did not get it. Maggie seemed unwilling to tell moe why, but I drdw it out of her. The cook had put things all away and washed the coffee- pot, and said to Mnaggie: "Go 'long, I'm not going to have one meal bothering round until the next one is ready." We exchanged   a few significant glances, and made the best of the situ- ation. She 'understood her business, that feminine monster, who had usurped such high-handed -rule in my establishment, but wo all kept out of her way. The delicious dinners and lunches and break- fasts, and the snowy kitchen, and the shining, tin, and the perfect order that reigned supreme, reconciled me to many of her ways; but I was far from being comfortable. Spicy said to Phl' "Sister Meddie never dares to drink two cups of coffee now, for if she sends for more she is liable to be discharged." One week, two weeks, and yet no clew to the robbers! I grew more and more philosophic, but Spicy's bursts of grief and self-reproaches were daily food. Sle was too light-hearted to pine under tho pressure of the misfortune, but she could not banish it from lber Iind. Phil lhd licked up the ghost story, and thought it a capital joke,   "She'll have to hurry up if she is going; to pay me a visit before I go to Detroit," he said, one evening. "And when may that sad time ar- rive?" I asked. "We have got so used to you, I don't know how wo are going to spare you." "I shall get off about Tuesday next, Providence permitting." he had been offered a better position in a Michigan bank, and had accepted. Wo shall miss him; but then we are not as timnid as we were, nnd Leo- nardus will bo home for a few weeks be- fore a great while," I said to Spicy. "I had just has soon he would go as not. He is only a lay figure anyway. All he does is to laugh at us when there is any real danger. And, to tell the up- and-down truth, I ami tired of his per- petual ding-dong about Splcy's ghost," she replied. "What an inconsistent young lady I Not half an hour ago you were begging him to stay." "Complimentary, purely. One must pamper a man's vanity a little. You know that as well as I, Meddie." A The night after 1he left, I went to the blue-room to get an extra pillow for Bright. I lighted the gas, drew down the window-shade and gathered up some newspapers which were scattered. One of the arms of my cane-rocker was miss- ing, and I searched for it until it turned up from behind the bureau. Then I dis- covered the handle gone from my deco- rated china pitcher, and after much ado all to myself I extracted it from the washstand drawer and stood holding the dismembered part in my hand, full of vexation, though not able to pin the  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7037-00000029"/> guilt of the accident to any one in par- ticular, when, suddenly, a gust of damp night air chilled and startled me, and, turning quickly around jn the direction of the closet-door, which had silently swung open, I encountered the black, piercing eyes of a tall, sickly-looking, thin-visaged woman, in a singularly- fashioned robe of white, more nearly re- sembling a counterpane than any thing I can name, and while my heart was struggling for room to turn over in my throat, and my blood was leaping through my veins with telegraphic velocity, she slowly receded from my sight and dis- appeared altogether  CIIAPTER VII. SPIOY'S COURAGE. "AND you think she was really a live woman, do you?" It was Spicy who asked that ques- tion, and it was I, lying on my bed, who replied, with an effort: "Certainly." "Then wlhat did you go and do such an absurdly silly thng as to faint away for?" "I can't explain. We have had con- siderable stir and excitement of late, and I suppose I am nervous, like womankind in general." "What was the color of her hair?" "Dark, or black. She reminded me of a Southern lady I once know. I wish I could have had strength and presence of mind enough to have followed her and unravelled the mystery." Oh, feddiel I am glad you didn't. She would have beguiled you into some   cranny or other, and that would have been the last of you. I wonder she didn't gobble you up as it was! But, say, did she look unhappy, as if she was tired of roving about between heaven and eartht th out any husband or home of her own, and in such queer clothes?" I smiled. "She looked very sad and a trifle wild," I replied. "I see! There is only one way in which I can ever arrive at the minutite of the case for certain, and that is by in- terviewing the ghost myself. I believe I will get big Ann to sit up with me some night and watch for her." I smiled again, and very incredulously. "You had better." "Don't be sarcastic, Meddie. Per- haps you think I don't dare? There is one thing about it, the ghost and I would have a great point of attraction, for wo should both be afraid of Ann." "Spicy, you are the oddest bundle of contradictions that it was ever my lot to meet! Would you really and truly and deliberately station yourself in the blue- room, with only Ann to protect you, and await the coming of our queer visitor?" "I believe I would," and there was meaning in the twinkling of her pretty eye. "May I buy up Ann with a bottle of whiskey?" "No, that would be hardly safe. But you may promise her an extra five dol- lars when I pay her montl's wages, if you wish." "You give me full perlmission tol make arrangements, do you?" "Yes." I had very little faith in her carrying out the daring project. It was not equal   to the original grain of mustard-seed. I knew how easy it was to plan and talk and get ready, and even fight with an invisible foe, but my late remarkable ex- perience lad taught me the fallacy of all self-measurements and human calcula- tions when brought to th unwelcome test. I was anxious to have the problem solved of who or what manner of per- son or spirit was thus intruding upon the privacy of our -little home, and why she cane and gazed in upon us, and went away again giving no sign! But I did not esteem Spicy the Droper one to fathom the secret, and I did not believe she would make the attempt. She was buzzing about all day, and several times alluded to her night's undertaking; said Ann was willing. She believed Ann was rather predisposed in favor of ghosts. I spoke to Nursy Brown about the fieak which Spicy had taken in her headl, and asked her if she thought I had better for- bid it. "Ol, no; if no good comes of it, no harm more serious than a scare will be likely to befall her." In the early part of the evening Spicy told me that she and Ann were going on duty as soon as the yeast came for the breakfast muffins. She had put on a little red jacket, embroidered with black, and her dainty curls, dressed with far more than her usual care, were floating over her neck and shoulders. Her cheeks were glowing, and her eyes were spark- ling with eagerness and expectation. Slhe was more lovely than I had ever s^cn her before, and I was giving her an affectionate mental embrace when Ann put her head through the door. "I are ready, miss."   "Have you been in the closet during the day to assure yourself that the win- dow is perfectly secure?"I asked. "Yes-yes, indeed!" replied Spicy. "Nursy Brown and I have been like two revolving lights ever since early in the morning. There isn't a sign of a Dlaco where a body can get in or oult. I lam going to put a lighted candle in there for the ghost's convenience." ' What shall you do first if you see anly one?" "The dear only knows! But I sha'n't fall down as you did, for one thing. I guess I shall say-' Good-evening, and how are the folks at home? '" "I shall feel of her, and see whlat she are made of!" spoke up Ann. "'That is right, and don't fail to find out where sh goes, too," I said. "I sha'n't lit her go at all, onless Miss Spicy tells me to," continled her cook- ship. They started on their way, alnd I heard Spicy saying in the lhall: "Now, Ann, you must not go to sleep. You know it is a part of our con- tract that I am not to give you a penny if you slmt your eyes once, except to wink." I wislicd I had been able to llave gone with thelm. I asked Nullrsy Brown not to go to bed, and to look inlto the bluie- room once in a while. It was so still in that part of the house as the hours slid away that I con- cluded they must all bo asleep, and, at last, getting more aroused and apprehln- sive, I got up and stood at my door anid listened. Finally, I determined thlt it woull1 not do im any more harni to go and see, than to fret and worry without  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7037-00000030"/> knowing.  Nursy Brown was in her rockirg-chair reading a new magazine, I passed by and peeped into the blue- room. Ann sat in a chair by the bureau, with her eyes fixed on the closet-door, and Spicy lay on the bed looking at Ann. They both saw me, and Spicy put her linger to her lip to warn me not to speak. She smiled while doing so, but the dim- ples at the corners of her mouth were expressive of high excitement rather than merriment. I returned to imy bed and it was not long before I slept quietly. IHow long I am unable to say. I was wakened by a laughl that sounded like a chink of silver dollars. No one who knew my sister Spicy intimately would be at a loss to know from whence it came. I started up, threw a shawl round me, and went to the blue-rooin. Not a soul -was there! Frightened, I stepped along and looked into the closet which was open I There stood Spicy quite alone intent on the ex- amination of an old daguerreotype by the dim liglit of the caindlo. It was not in a case, and upon the back of it was pasted an autograph. She looked from the picture to the name, then to the pic- ture again, revolving the two backl; and fcrth before heir eyes, entirely oblivious to my presence until I spoke to her. And oven then she could not seem to dis- engage lher thoughts sufficiently to reply. "What is it? '5 I asked, the second and finally the third time. "' It is --" But she got no farther, and still seemed to bo lost in astonishment, or in some great absorbing study. "Let me see." And I stcpped down beside lier.   "Ah! a younag man I rather good- looking, too! Nose decidedly Roman. Standing collar. Hair parted in the mid- dlc." She turned it over and I read the "FRED GILDERSLEEYE!" "' Where did it como froml? "It was on the floor just where I stand! I hit mIly foot against -it and stooped and picked it up!" "And you had been in before, and it was not there then?" "No. The floor was (clean as Ann's' kitchen table." We went back into the blue-room, and under the gas, with our heads rub- bing atgainst eoach other, gazed I  inth the honest, pleasing face that was returning the Colllllient with spirit. How happelned you to go in the closet?" "Ohi, I must tell you all .about it. You see Ann was so prodigiously courna-  geous that I didn't have much faith in her. It was getting so late that I had made up my mind we should have no adventures to entertain you with in the mlorning, and I thought I would have a little fun all to myself, trying to see how much the old cook would bdar. So I pretended I heard footsteps going up and down in theo closet. She looked wild, and opened hler mouth and eyes. Then I whispered and asked her to open the closet-door and let the poor ghlost in, so that we could get through and go to bed! You ought to hlave seen her t-eeth chat- ter I And such an awful look as she gave me I And then she got pale, and her- eyes bunged out, and the big flat bow she wears on the thin spot (top of her   head) fell off, and she stretched out her hands as if she was going to swim, and began: ' Oh, fauthcr, and hauly mother and the blessed virgin, prcsarvo us I' and it was so' comical to me, for IP hadn't heard any noise in the closet, and then she stammered, and choked, and gurgled, and cried ' go-go-go-go-away; ' and I was so intent upon seeing the end of her conniption, or whlatever it was, that it never for a momenlt occurred to me tliat there was any thing else to look at, until she ran from the room, and I laughed! Then I moved my head, and lo! the strange woman, or lost, whichl you and Nursy Brown halve described, was stand- ing, in the closet-door! I sprang from the bed and put my foot through my hoop, and tripped, annd floundered, and was so long in recovering my balance that I filed to see her ladyship home. When I got to the closet there was no one there, and nothing to bo found but this picture? Meddie, do you believe in witches?" "No. I have not much belief in any thing just now, and what I have is un- settled. Were you not frightened at all? You seem to halve deported yourself with great coolness!" "Oh, as for that, I felt a little squeam- ish in the beginning, but it is not half as bad to face a danger on your own re- sponsibility as it is to be pitched into it bly somebody else. It is like my fidget- ing everybody, and the driver in particu- llar, when I ride after a frisky horse. But out at Aunt Mierv's -,s list summer, I not only drove her runaway Dick to all points of the compass, but I often actu- ally harnessed the old, cross, biting beast, Last week, one day, I was riding in the   omnibus on the west side, and allnost got the high7stri7cs becauseo  th( horses kicked up. So you see it would not bo safe to count on my valor. It conlmes ad oces. As for the ghost, I was disappoint- edc. She di(d not colmo ) to mlly m1ark1 :tt all. She wasln't dre fe pretty, llad no whito sheet about IIt; ]her garb wns plain black I If lly eyes served me right, the bottoan of lher dress was all mud. I do wish sleo h11:d not been in suchl a hurry." ' Did, she make no noise whllatever in hler exit?" "Not thllt I call complain I o I made O1110, though. I spilt Phil's cologne bot- tle on the table and smashed it. I hav: not looked after the pieces yet, but I guess they ;will kcep." "Let us go and exansine tlte wintdow once more, Spicy." "What, the ono inl the closet, a^reel," and away she trippDd. It was fast.  Our combined foirce could not sliake it. TlIe Imlystery deep- ened, and could not be explained away by any possibility. And the picthure, springing upon us in sucl a s illgular maxll- net, added to our mystification. Trute, it minght lave been amlong the rulblish in connection withl the ol( letters, but lnot very proDable, because, if so, whly didl we not finl it before? or how coluld it lanve moved itself ilto'the 1,place w 1ere it wa's discovered? "It makes mle think of lily dr1:I,"D said Spicy. "I wish you would step anlld 'ask N11'r- syBlrown for a shawl, I ail getting elil- ly," I said. Spicy obeyed, but was back presently . " llWheie can ileo be? Shle is not in her room!"  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7037-00000031"/> "Not in her room! Tile baby's there?" "Oh, yes, as sweet as a dumpling." "Then she can't be far off. Look in the bath-room." It was at the end of the hall close by where we were standing. Spicy pushed open the door, and, instead of Nursy Brown, there was Ann, counting her beads 1 "You are a great one I  Whllo did you leave to take care of me, I should like to know? Do you call that pluck? I never shall put you on guard again!" exclaimed Spicy. Ann slowly arose froin her knees. "So you are not much of a soldier, after all? Tell me what you saw." I addressed her from the door of the blue- room l. "I know it was onkind to desart Miss Spicy, but I daren't do no other way, cause my old imisthress, who's dead this many a year, was right there afore me, and shure it was me she was afthur." "How did sihe look?" "Very quare in the eye, marm. Dis- contented like, as if she was a niite lone- some, and wanted her owld faithful Ann to fix her broth, and make her tnay for her." Spicy giggled, and then, trying to con- trol Ilherself with a sort of nervous des- peration, burst into tears. 1"What are yon crying for?"I asked, smniling. "Because my grandmother is dend; " and  then she giggled again, until I thought she was going to strangle. The north hall-door opened and shut just then, and while I strained my cars in breathless anxiety for rwhat' was to 1 \   ; follow, Nursy Brown ran up the stairs. She was panting and more excited than usual for her, but when Spicy questioned eagerly as to what was the matter, and where she had been, she only answered: "Nothing is the matter, dear; and I've been under the barberry-bush, to try to settle the point in my mind whether any one climbed up or down the grape- arbor near the closet window." "And did you see any one?"  "No, dear." "You know the ghost has paid me a visit? Ann and I both saw her!" "I prqsumed so, and that was why I slipped out as soon as I heard the stir in -the blue-room. But I am back no wiser than I went." "We may as well lock up the room and go to bed," I said, beginning to fecl the eff'ect of my unseasonable exertions. "And you want no more of me, do you?" asked Ann, in a hollow voice. "Yes; we want you to pray till m6rning, to keep us clear of purgatory," said Spicy, with a sober face. "It' yo are afraid to go down to your room alone I will go with you, and count sled-stakl;es as I go." F "Hush I "T said, grasping her arm. I was/afraid Ann might take excep- tions'to being ridiculed, bpt se did not seem toinind it. She looked as if shoe thought Spicy was going to carry out liher proposition, and I think she would hlave very much liked to have had her done so. I shook my head, and she departed. Nursy Brown put out the candle and the gas, and-locked the blue-room door, and Spicy staid in my room to give me llmy medicine at four o'clock.   I don't know how  many tiimes she looked at that picture of Fred Gilder- sleeve before she got quietl Once she kissed it. She put it under her pillow, took it out again and laid it in a chair, removed it over to the table, carried it to the bureau, brought it back to the bed, and changed it no less than a dozen times froml the pillow to the chair and back again. I did not esteem it worth while -to talk any more, for the night was far spent, and we both slept at last. I had a carpenter come the next day and put a lock on the closet-door. Nur- sy Brown advised me to keep thoe blue- roomn under lock and key also. It was not pleasant to feel that a portion of one's house'tWas uninhabitable, but I re- solved upon that course until such tilme as we should be able to decide what sort of a being was entaliled upon our hospi- tality. Leonlardus arrived, shoulder - straps and all, on the first day of July. loe had got lea ve of absence for a month, and brought gladness to our hearts. Weo lad so mnuch to tell lim, and we talked so fast and so constantly, that I began to fear that hc never would remember the half wo were saying, and ihad already proposed a little music by way of giving him a rest, when Spicy began about her ghost, and told the story in such a divert- ing style that he laughed heartily. "Four of you all saw the same thing, did you? Well, thant sounds like evi- dence. No getting over tlat." But the robbery did not strike him in so pleasant a vein. His brow clouded, and he asked a great many questions. I saw Spicy's lip quivering; and the sparkle in her eyes getting dimmed from an ap-   proacling -lowter, and hastily turned tho sublject. There was such an excellent opportunity to do so just then, too, for Nursy Brown was coming up the walk with Bright, and Ilis fither hadnnot seen himi yet. IHow my helart beat Ls 11he caught him up, and tossed him in the air, and held him at aris' length, and looked at himi I Bright was afraid. He was not used to gentlemen. A soldier in full uniform he had never seen except on the street. He did not appreciate the familiar hugs and kisses of the great bronzed fellow who shook him round. He made up a lip more remarkable for every thing else than beauty, and stretched his chubby arms toward Nursy Nrown, who stood waiting in the entry, and then he screamied with a volume of sound that caused Leonardius to p1)tss him over with the remark: '"You will make a good general, my boy." We heard him cry for some time after he realied the nursery. Leonardus sit- ting on the piano-stool, with his hands in his pockets, was looking at the carpet. "I was trying to think, Meddie, where I had seen those eyes before," he said, at length, with a perplexed air. "What eyes, or whose eyes? excuse my grammar." "Bright's nurse's, or whatever you call the person who took him from me.' "I don't know, I am sure." ' Neither do I. I will tell you who she remninds me of. You have heard o1110 speak of Lewis Vance, my old chum at Harvard, who is now Brigadier-General Vance of the army of the Potomac? Well, it is his wife. I was at their house  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7037-00000032"/> in Boston, after my return fromu Califor- nia. He married Judge Shubill's niece of Detroit, one of the most beautiful girls on this continent." "In what respect does Nursy Brown look like her??" "I really cannot say. It is her eyes, I reckon. There is something very pecu- liar about them. Don't you think so?" "Indeed I do," chimed in Spicy. "And by the way, tlere is a sad bit of history connected with that unfortu- nate pair. I met poor Vance when I went to Washington  with those dis- patches, and, one night, by the flicker- ing light of llis camnl-fire, lie unburdened Iis heart to Ime. Ite married his wife abroad, and I never knew thlm circum- stances before. She was travelling with her brother, her only near relative, and in Florence thhey fell in company withl Lewis Vance. He and young Ev- crett had known each other in Buffalo, where the latter -was doing a thriving mercantile business." "What was the sister's name?" ask- ed Spicy and 1, both in the same breath. "Ida--Ida Everett.  Why do you stare so?" "Never mind, o onil," I said, as cahln- ly as possible, although my hleart was getting up a great tattoo at the prospect of learning sometling of Ida Everett's fortunes. "Well, as I was saying, the gentle- men knew each other, and Vance fell in love with the lady. Ho offered himself in his abrupt and impetuous manner, and was very kindly and firmly refused. Still he hovered about, determined to win hery and saw lher daily. HiTs love increased until it became an infatuation.  the   othier fell sick, and lis" life ,Ias in gJreat danger, so that it became necessary, to remove hh in to a sinall German town where the air was dry and pure.

"Full of sorrow for her loved and lost brother, and despairing lest s1he should bo left in a foreign land, not only devoid of ftinds %wherewith to accomplisi her homeward trip, but depellndent upon her own very lilited travellingt experi- ence, she listened witi more lenit]y to tle lprotestations of her lover, annd ;wwlej el m vowed that lhe would not leovepler, whlether she marxied him or not, napl on Ilis bended knees begged her to savclim from self-destruction by becomingl lli's wife, she at last consented , relictailtlv, ho -well knew, for she was firank cnoiigh to tell him, on more than one occasion that she loved another, and where it was not returned. ' The wedding must have been a sad one. Vance, whose habits were lione of the best, and who had been so long un- der self-imposed restraint in order to obtain his wife, fell headlong into dissipa- tion. In Paris he launched out into the   most unbounded extrava-ance. Arrived in Boston, he bought a Beacon-Street mansion, filled it with costly trappings, supplied his wife with silks and s'ltins and jewelry, which she would never wear, and abused' and adored her I:tcord- ing to his moods. lHe was a man of most unlgovernable passions, and, with the tears of contrition streamin g down his weather-beaten face, he told me how he had often struck her in his fits of mad- ness, for no other reason than because she looked so sweet and suffering. He want- ed to teach her to have spunk enough to) strike back. But he never did. He had the misfortune to have a fortiune left him and was on the straight road through it, although it happened to be so large that he had time to cause a great deal of misery before he got to the end of the route. "One strainge freak which he carried through with a high hand was, not to al- low his wife to visit her uncle, and, when that dear old gentleman came to Boston, he managed to make his stay so uncom- fortable, that neither Ida nor the judge cared to have it prolonged. About two years after they were married she an- nounced her intention of going to De- troit for an absence of two weeks. He raved. But she was decided for once. Seeing himself powerless to prevent her from going, he swore she should leave her baby at home, a little fellow not quite as old as our Bright, and 'carried his point with threats. "Her uncle returned with her at the time appointed, but did not go to her house. He had business in Providence and New Haven, and went on immedi- ately. Vance met her, half-drunk as   usual, and told her se11 shouldl pay for her ridiculous W'ilfulness inll going to )e- troit against his wishes.

He rode by hcr side in the carriage to Mt. Auburn cemetery. Ho stood by her side while a little mound was raised. He did all that was respectable and prop- er. But he never once got a glimpse of her face from behind the wall of crape which cnshrouded her, nor did they ex- change a word during the whole time. He was extremely depressed, from the want of his accustomed stimulant, and left the carriage before arriving at his own door, to step into a saloon. He went home about midnight, and found on his table a little note of farewell. Ilis wife had left him forever. It ran thus: "LEWIS: You have no accuser. Fear not. I sent for our physician and told him I had dropped my baby. He could not bring the darling back to life. Its death is supposed to be the result of a mother's carelessness. ' Seek me not, for you will never find me. I do not go to my uncle, nor to any one who ever knew me. Nor shall I ever present any claims for one penny of your property, nor for wlht was once mine, but is now in your hands. IDA.' "If you could have seen that stout man weep in his bitterness of spirit when lie slowed me that worn note, your heart would have bled for hin, richly as he deserved his punishment. lie swears that from that hour until the present time lie has not tasted a glass of liquor. That until the breaking out of the Rebellion he has never ceased his unavailing search for his loved and lost. He has travelled through the country on foot to ferret out, if possible, her refuge in some by-place, has walked up and down the streets of large cities, gazing   into every face that he passed; has jour- neyed from point to point, from horizon to horizon--the one great purpose of his life to find and humble himself be- fore her whom he had so terribly and so cruelly wronged, and crave forgive- ness for the past, even if the future must be a stinging blank." CIAPTER VIII. REMORSE AND RETRIBUTION. "How it does soften one toward a wicked man to have ]lim repcntant " said Spicy, with a little gulp. "I would never want to see him, though, if I were she." "She must have understood himi well to provide against such a possible con- tingency," continued Leonardus. "He has never so much as obtained the slight- est trace of her. And she cut herself equally adrift from all her friends. Not one of them can tell whether she be liv- ing or dead. Judge Shubill has gone down in sorrow to his grave. he was a bachelor, some web of romance woven into his history, I believe. I have some idea that I have been told that it was Ida's mother whom he loved in his youth, but I am not sure.  At any rate he adopted the little orphan, and educated her; and very nearly idolized her. Now he has left the whole bulk of his proper- ty, real and personal, in trust for her, should she ever come forward to receive it. He gave her $50,000 as a bridal present, and that, I suppose, was what she referred to in her note. Yance says he has deposited it, subject to her order, and so settled his own affairs that heirs-   at-law cannot put in their hearing unless his wife's decease is properly authenti- cated. He hopes to fall in battle, and courts the positions of greatest danger. Iis reputation for daring and intrepidity is unequalled in that division of the army. Life is an intolerable burden to him, and remorse is sapping the very foundations of his existence. "I took out that little picture of Bright which you sent me, Meddie, as I have had a fashion of doing at any time, and under any circumstances, and was intently regarding it, wlien all at once he leaned forward and looked over my shoulder: "'Good God! Belmore, how did you come by that? ' "His face looked like a dying nian's. I explained, and after a few minutes hie gasped l: "' Pardon me; it is so like my boy that I thought you were displaying it to taunt me I O Belnore, my punishment is greater than I can bear.'" We were interrupted by a summons to dinner, and conversation turned upon the thousand and one topics so interest- ing to the heads of families, and so un- interesting to the world in general. Spicy tried to tell Leonardus about the old letters, and their connection with Ida Everett, but I had Bright in my arms, and was trying to teach him to say Papa, and he would persist in getting it "Pay, pay," and the brigadier couldn't listen to any thing clse just then. After- ward one of his favorite rice-puddings came on the table, and he took the youngster himself to try to make him say Plum; but, with the obstinacy nat- ural to children, the little mischief 5   screwed up his tfac and kept saying "Berwy, bcrwy," leaving his mouth wide open to have one put in occasionally. In the eiening we went out to walk, and the next day Leonardus had business with the commandant of the post at Camp Douglas, and did not get homlo until four o'clock r. Mt. "Now, Spicy, what about those love- epistles?" he asked, as he stretched hin- self upon the lounge in the library. She ran and got them, told him some, and read other portions to him. he was greatly interested. "How happened it, Maddie, that you never took the trouble to find out who lived in this house before you?" he asked. "I did. It is the old Dwight Man- sion, you know. They, or some of the members of the Dwight family, have oc- cupied it iomln the time it was built until about a year ago. Then it was rented to a family by the namo of Thomas. No one seems to know much about them, ex- cept that they paid their rent and let tile place go to the dogs. If window-shutters flopped, they let them flop; if water- pipes burst, they let thc burst; if rats chose to pAy on the fiont-stairs, they let thelm play there; in short, as chil- dren used to say when I was among their happy number: 'They did as they do in Spain: When it rained, they let it rain.' Where they went,lwhen they left here, no one seems to know, any more than where they oame from.   Tley had boarders, as near as we can ascertain. But thero is not much prospect of learn- ing more." "I see. And any discoveries in re-  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7037-00000034"/> gard to the Gildersleeves wouldn't help us, or Ida Everett either." 1"Poor thing I IHow she must have suf- fered!" said Spicy. "Now, wouldn't it be the strangest thing of all," and she low- ered her voice to a half-whisper, " if our Nursy Brown were that very individual 'i "I don't think so," Leonardus re- plied, promptly and decidedly. "I must say I did have a suspicion of the kind the first day I arrived. The deep, rich blue of her eye, with such a depth of soul in back of it, brought Mrs. Vance viviidly to my mind. But I have ob- served this person more closely since, and I am certain that one so highly bred and nurtured and cultivated, nnd who at the last was drowned in suclh an ocean of trouble as Ida Everett, could never have fitted herself to the position which Nursy Brown holds, and with such a measure of serene content. Ida Everett, with all her other gifts and graces, was a brilliant writer, and won distinction under a nom de plume, even before her marriage. She would have been much more likely to have resorted to literaturo for a livelillood, if she took no money with her, as Vance fully supposes." So it seemed to me. IHow theo strong- er always influence the weaker! Ten minutes before, I was morally confident that Nursy Brown was the heroine of my tale. I had sketched it on my brain, accounted for her passionato devotion to my baby by its resemblance to her own, divined the greatness of her character by the marvellous aptitude with which she't engrossed herself in little things, and was trying to shape my figures of speech when I should, some day, approach her on the delicate and distressing subject.   One argument from Leonardus, and I was all afloat again. "I have to go to Buffalo on the 5th. Now, wifey, if you will tie up a few things in a pillow-case and keep me com- pany, we will stop a day or two in Cleve- land, and visit the Burgoynes." I' I shall be delighted to do so, I know of nothing to prevent," was my quick response. Although I did not say so, I had a few preparations to make for my jour- ney. The buttons were not on imy new travelling-dress nor the sleeves sewed in. My brown silk was too long. I had had in contemplation the taking off the skirt from the waist and the shortening of it, and-I must do that, surely, for it was my only dress-dress. ]My hat must be newly trimmed too, and I must go down-town for gloves and sundry othher articles. So tlat, with my plotting and planning, I buried Ida Everett and all her possible connections. Leonardus, like many another man whomnl I have known, never was willing llis wife slould do any thing, when lihe was present. Her whole attention must be devoted to him. I was glad enough to humor himl in it generally, but whhen one is going sonewhere and choose to lookl her feminine best, wliy, it is incon- venient, to say thei least. lowever, he had some running about the city to do himself, looking after soldiers' families, he said, and with Nursy Brown and Spi- cy both to assist me, I was nearly ready, when Ann came lumbering up to my room whiere I was sorting out my collars and cuffs and neck-ribbons. "I should like to be gettin' my mon- ey if you plqse, 1ma'am.':, /   "Yes, Ann, I will give it to you this evening. Do you want it all?" "I does. I am going to take a little picnic to-morrow." "Oh, I cannot spare you. I lhave in- vited some friends to dine." "I gets no dinner for nobody on the Fourth of July. I always has that to my- self. We folks that steam over the hot stoves must get a little change some- timtes." "But you know my husband, whom I have not seen for more than a year, is here, and I want to make every thng as pleasant for him'as possible. I will giveo you a day next week. Won't that an- swer just as well?" 1' No, man'am." lMost emphatically spoken.  "I hasn't seen my mn'tn for twice that tilme, but I has got to have a little pleasure myself for all tlat. I sha'n't do no work in this house to-mor- row.1." "What I not get my breakfast in the morning?" "Sure and I sha'n'tl  The picnic goes at six o'clock." At any other time I should have said, "Very well, you need not trouble your- self to come back; " but I thought of my trip with Loonardus on the day following the Fourth, and swallowed my annoyrance. She was off according to her programme before we had got two-thirds of the way to finally in our dreams. We worried through the day as best we could. Nur- sy Brown cookled, and I was baby-tend- er; Maggie washed dishes, and Spicy swept carpets; and Leonardus divided his tinie between entertaiiing our guests, and throwing open the doors and letting the flies in as fast as I could get them   out, and firing-off crackers and torpedoes for Bright's edification. In the evening we had a private display of pin-wheels and Roman candles, and thus ended the most doleful day of the season. Bright was cross and wouldn't go to sleep, nor would he allow the rest of us any indul- gence of the kind. At a quarter-past twelve Ann had not arrived. Our train left the Southern Michigan depot at six in the morning. What was to be done? I could not leave such a burden on the shoulders of Nursy Brown -it was enough for her to take care of Bright. Ann might not return at all; Maggie was not strong, the enther wals oppressively hot, and she knew noth- ing about cooking in any event.  It was inevitable, I must stay at 11home. Lconardus and   I were both disap- pointed. "Then I think I will not stop in Cleveland--I will go the other route through Detroit," he said. "Why not stop over one night with Cousin Prlil?" "I believe I will. I would like to know how the boy is getting on." "Be careful I Don't call him a boy. He would think  you meant to insult him." Leonardus laughed  "Have you the number of his boarding-house?" ' He boards with his sister, Mrs. Law- rence. I have iher address on a card. Here it is," and I put the little guide- board in his vest-pocket. "I will get my breakfast at the Briggs House; don't try to wake when I go," and my good-night was my good-by for many days. We had no Ann the next day, and,  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7037-00000035"/> although I had never had a better cook, I felt that her course was run in my establishment. I made another tour through the intelligence-offices, which resulted in the employment of a pretty, cross-eyed little German girl, and I in- troduced her with all necessary. pomp and circumstance into the clean, well- kept kitchen of the recreant Ann. She proved to be a jewel in her way. Had been assistant-cook in a hotel, was ami- able as well as efficient, and quite con- soled me for the loss I had sustained. Her Annship did not make her appear- ance for thirteen days, when she walked in one morning fresh and blooming, her muslin dress as pink and starchy as ever, and, with the blandest of smiles, asked me if I was pretty well. Yes, I was, and I hoped she was in the enjoyment of -the same blessing. It was on a Monday, and I was in the laundry, telling Louisa how to wash some point-lace. She beckoned me aside (Ann, not Louisa), and asked me who that little snip was, who was switching round at such a rate. ' It is my new cook, Louisa." "But she can't do your work!" "She pleases me very well, so far." "Oh, she never'll suit you in the world. Nobody but I can do that. I understand all your ways and tastes, and I makes every thing illigant, and I wash- es like new. Send her agoin'. I am come back, you see." "How came you to leave me as you did, Ann?" "Well, I'll just tell you all about it. That picnic went, you know, down to Cottage Grove, and it got through along in the afternoon, and I started for home.   I hadn't had any thing to eat but some cake I carried with me, and nothing to drink but jest one leetle glass of beer, which I took with a friend, because I never drink or any thing of that kind, I am too principled, and as I was a-sayin', I was a-comin' home in the State-Street cars, and I saw another car agoin' down toward the grove again, and I jest hap- pened to think I had disremembered my parasol, and so I got out of one car and got into the other car; and then I was kinder sociable like with some of the gentlemen and ladies who seemed to think I didn't understand my business; and the conductor sasscd- me, and all I did was to slap him in the face, and the great, mean Irish pumpkin went and stopped the car and called the perlise, and had me jest. dragged to the station- house. Then they locked me up and fined me six dollars! I hadn't got noth- ing to pay it, cause imy pus had been stolen at the picnic, but I told them that, if bMrs. General Belmore only knew about itr, she would send me the six dol- lars mighty quick-" I interrupted her: "' Oh! I hope you did not tell them you were my servant! How disgraceful!" "Why, bless your dear heart, I had not done any thing. They had only got it all up agin me. They wouldn't come up and tell you and get the money, so I had to go to the Bridewell and work it out. But I didn't associate among the low folks at all! Oh, no! There was jest a few of us, aristocratic ones, who knit and sewed, and made the rest of them wait on us, and had a pretty good time together." "I can't take you back, Ann. You   must provide yourself with  another place."   / "Why not? I am an illigant cook, as you know yourself, and I niver drinks nor does any thing wrong!" There was something extremely lu- dicrous in the effrontery with which she looked full into my face and made that assertion. I smiled in spite of myself. "But you have been in Bridewell. I would not like to have a jail-bird in my kitchen!!' "That's jest nothin' at all, only the way folks looks at it. I's been there lots of times, and cooked jest as good whin I came out. I had been there more'n five weeks whlen I engaged with you first, and this is no wosser than that." I almost sliludered  lHow little we know sometimes what sort of people we hlarbor I It is needless to add that I de- clined the overtures of my ex-cook, and thanked my stars that I had found her out with no more serious consequences. I also had occasion to rejoice over tilo thtwating of my travelling projects, as you will learn presently. Leonardus stopped in Detroit and hunted up Phil; that is, he found Phil's sister and spent the night. Phil was at a concert and did not return until very late, and Lconardus finally decided to stay over till evening and take the night train for Buffalo. The two rambled about the city that day; and, finally, Phil persuaded Leo- nardus to step into a gallery and have his picture taken.- While waiting for the operator, they examined the specimens of his art which were lying on the count- ers arnd hanging on the walls. Leo- nardus picked up the card photograph   of a negro, and was laughing at his dis- play of finery--a ruffled shirt-front, fringed neck-tie, watch-chain, and fin- ger-rings. Presently his countenance changed, and he stepped along to a stronger light.' "Look here, Phil!  What do you makeo of this?" Their eyes were both riveted upon a peculiar charm suspended to theo clhain. "It is a greyhound," said Phil. "So I say.  And the fac-simile of the one, if not the very same charm, which I gave to Meddli on our wedding- day. Perlhaps weoveo got hlold of the thread, whch, by winding up carefully, will lead to the detection of the rob- bers." They instituted inquiries. The artist knew something of the whereabouts of his African   highness--the detectives found out the rest; and when Leonardlus stopped again in Detroit, on his return from  Buffalo, he had the satisfcition of identifying my stolen property. As was subsequently shown, the old Trishman who moved us, and who spotted the goods, entered into a partnership with the negro to accomplish the busi- ness. The negro was an expert and did the work, and they divided the proceeds. They had considerable difference of opin- ion about who should come in for the watch and its accompaniments, for the man of color said: "You can't nober sell no such thing widout the d'tectables bein' after you and disconveniencin' you." But it was finally settled as above. They had disposed of the ibuttons and the garnet set, but they had given themn much trouble and been an n  profitale,  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7037-00000036"/> investment. My solitaire diamond, Cuf- fy said he would put away for his Nan- cy, as it was of no account much. The pearls had fallen to Patrick's share, and he had given them to his old woman. He didn't know where she was, but his memory was stirred up, and, after tedi- ous researches, Leonardus confronted my remarkable Ann in a neighbor's kitchen. "And is Patrick O'Daly your hus- band??" "Well, he married me onst, but he niver's took no care of me nor nothin' like that."  "Do you know where he is now?" "No. Nor it don't make any mat- ter." "Iie has sent me to you to get a pin and a pair of ear-rings, which he says he gave you for a present some time in June, while you were living with Mrs. Bellore." "Humph I Presint, was it? He tould me to tuck 'em away in my trunk o' things, which stands in your wood-shed I That's all I know about it." "Step round with me, if you please, and get them. They belong to my wife." She looked rather defiant, but an in- dividual with a star on his breast was more potent in his persuasions than Leo- nardus knew how to be, and the pearls came forth as good as now. And a set of my best towels, and six pairs of linen pillow-cases, and Bright's silver lmlg, and five forks also, by order of the sub- scriber I I could hardly believe my own eyes! And that they should have been under my own roof all the time, even if it was the wood-shed roof. Louisa had once or twice asked me why Ann did not take   that old trunk of hers away. I sup- posed she had no place to take it to, and I supposed correctly. But I little dreamed what it contained. Ann walked in as self-possessed as if nothing had happened: "I are jest agoin' to lave the place I've got. They don't have no order there, nor no system, nor nothin'. They keeps the tay and the sluger locked up, and dales out things to me, and meddles with my closets. You know I can cook illigant. I jest suit you. I amn ready to come now.   onu is a lady and keeps good society, and never fusses with your help." Slhe threw a smirk into my face, which did not take effect. I had the hardness of heart to refuse to take her into my service, and, whrat was more, I stood coolly by and saw her led away toward the place prepared for all Chica- goans who do not walk in the paths of honesty,- though where but few enter. She was acquitted when the trial came off, owing to the absence of proof in regard to her complicity in the rob- bery.  But Patrick and Cuffy were doomed to steady labor for the period of five years. Long before Leonardus turned his face warward, our house became the busy field for dress-makers' operations. Spicy was going to New York; in Sep- tember, to finish her education at Miss Gilbert's school on Fifth Avenue. I was to be her escort to the great city, and there was work to be done for me also. To keep the coast clear within crit- icising distance of our army officer, I threw open the blue-room and all, the cutting and fitting were done there. Then,   as we were crowded for room to spread new goods without rumlpling, I. opened the ghost-closet, laid sheets on the floor, and made it a regular store-room. "I expect we shall tempt the inhab- itants of this realm until we get up an- other scene in the drama," said Spicy, as on her knees she straightened out the folds of a now dress, and left it lying at full length near the window. How often a word spoken in jest proves, alas, too true! CHAPTER IX. MISS TERRAPIN. LEONARDUS had been gone three weeks. We were so crowded with work that I had no time to mope and be lone- ly. I was bending all my energies to get ready to leave for the East by the 10th of September, in order to make a brief visit in Albany before dropping Spicy at hler school. The tinme was so close at and that we needed more as- sistance, and Spicy took it upon herself to find another dress-maker. In a third- floor on Lake Street she was rewarded ly success. She found Miss Terrapin. I had heard of the lady before, for, whatever her business, she was undoubt- edly a lady. My Aunt Hatty, Cousin Phil's mother, knew her when a child in the little town of Gothllnd, near Northamipton, in Massachusetts. They were brought up together, that is, they bothl attended Sunday services in the Congregational meeting-house in the centre, and while Aunt Hatty sat in the square pew at the right of the pulpit, between her father aud mother, and dared not so much as raise her hand to   brush a fly from her face for fear of the tithig-'lan, Clara Terrapin sang in thlo choir.  She was the  daughter of the squire, and the house they lived in had two chimneys, and her brothers wore gloves to church. A dozen years later, when progress had left its mark even in that isolated locality- in the shape of a new church and a town-hall, and Aunt Hatty had gone back there on a visit with her father (they lived in Hartford then), she learned, among other interesting items, that Clara Terrapin was at the South, teaching. The townspeople esteemed it a distinguished honor to bo able to report so favorably of one of their num- ber, and the young and ambitious were studying how they might emulate her She must have conceived the unpop- ular notion that God never put her into this world simply to take music-lessons, flirt, and get married, for she had gone on through life cultivating her tl i nts, inventing ways of usefulness, crowdilg efforts into untried spots, failing, trying again, learning, unlearning, and relearn- ing, until she had reached her prescnt standard in the igh building where Spicy found her. At one time she hand at slnug little property, which had been bequeathed her by a deceased relative. It was a source of perpetual peace of mind. Money is so very convenient I An! 'tlthen it is not always esteemied eminently re- spectable to be destitute. So he heard it said: "Want sense, the world will o'erlook It; Want feeling, it will find somo excusne; But, if the world knowa yon want money,   '-You are certain to get Its abuse."  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7037-00000037"/> And she was beginning to practice on the principle- "The wisest advice in creation Is, ne'er on its kindness to call; If ever you want its assistance, Just show you don't need it at all." People went so far at that time as to comment upon the singularity of her tastes in remaining Miss Terrapin I One widower and thrllee old bachelors de- clared that womenh were created to be taken care of by nmen, without regard to circumstances I They were never known to advocate- such heresy after one bright morning, when, through the failure of a certain bank, the maiden's dependence passed away like a shadow! She took the measure of herself at once, and demonstrated to the world that misfortunes could be healthfully borne. Yes, she would battle for her living, while hands and heart were left. She could not open a school with advantage, for she was behind the times in youthful lore. Literature was not in her line. So she rented a doctor and his wife with the house they lived in, and commenced the business of feeding- and sleeping people at so much per head. For a time all went well. Her prin- cipal boarder was an eye-and-ear doctor, and forty. He had a broad, expansive forehead, a soft blue eye, a large, domi- neering nose, an uncertain mouth, long, curly, brown hair, and heavy mustache and whiskers. He was neither too tall nor too short, but of medium  stature, and thick-set. he was vastly agreeable, vastly restless, and everywhere present. By virtue of having been rented with the house, hoe felt called upon to look af- ter its interests in a supervisory manner. He made semi-hourly excursions to the   closets, pantries, drawers, and other pri- vate places, to say nothing of all the way- stations betiween the garret and the cel- lar. He stopped up rat-holes, tended the furnace, lectured the servants, and made himself useful generally. Indeed, he was just one of those sort of men who might have danced a German upon the point of a cambric-needle, and had room enough lett for an audience. It was suth a comfort to have him round, so thought Miss Teirapin in her blissfull inexperience. It was the ser- vants who made wry ffaces  hllen Lis orders multiplied, and obedience became dipracticableo Then he bought them up with little presents of wax-flowers, which did not cost him any thing, and his wife donated a few high-colored rib- bons from the upper bureau-drawer. He was the family carver by his own appointment. It was so very kind of him I his dexterity in securing the ten- derloin of the steak to himself was ad- mirable to behold! It inclined Miss Ter- rapin's argus-eyed boarders to sue for a life-lease of their apartments. He al- ways got hungry in the middle of the day. It was so pleasant for Miss Ter- rapin to have a man's head at the helhn. He could inst 'uct her how to provide for the lunches, else she mlliglit have fallen into the popular delusion of putting suchl dishes on her table as she could afford. The bill of fare, according to Dr. Med- dlesome, was cold meat, hot meat-stews, hash, oysters, potatoes, hominy, boiled rice, bread-and-butter, gingerbread, pie, horseradish,. mustard, molasses, and something sour--either pickles or cold cabbage; did not object to a lemon. Af- ter that he could manage to exist until   dinner-time, if it was- on the table promptly at six o'clock.  If, by any chance, there was a delay of five min- utes, as there would be when he called the cook away from taking up the vege- tables to hold a candle for him to fix the cellar-door knob, or the waitress from setting, the table to sweep off the front steps, he was at the liead of the stairs calling down to say he was in a hurry. Miss Terrapin had a very uncomforta- ble way of serving her dinner in courses. She was unkind enough to omit the salad until after the sole. Dr. Meddlesome expostulated with her, and was .con- foeunded when sho asserted iher own su- premacy, and declined to make any changes in that particular. It was clear- ly a declaration of war. He was not fond of strong-minded women, and he took immediate steps to hint on the sly his dissatisfaction to the rest of the boarders. Nothing was right any more.  The coffee and  plates were both codd in the morning.  It might have been because he read Miss Ter- rapin's paper for ten minutes or so after sitting down to the table. It saved his taking one himself.  She ventured to hint the same to him, and he took mor- tal otfence, but never a newspaper. Boarders left, without giving notice or reasons, She filled their plalces as soon -as possible, but not always withlout pe- cuniary loss and subsequent embarrass- ment. She felt as if she were riding round all the sharp corners of life in a hearse. Finally, her servants began to leolve her in the most extraordinary man- ner! She suspected the cause when she saw Dr. Meddlesome dodging about in the lower regions, but she could not   fi'ght him without understanding his se- cret machinery. A mysterious silence hung abotlt her kitchlen. she hired now servants, but as soon as she turned hler ba ck they departed(. Tleo breakfasts anld the dilnners an1d the luncles were no, longer properly cooked, for the lady of the hlouse could not stand over the raiirgo ierselft, and be wandering up1 an down the highways and thoe by-ways at tle same time looking for servaltts. Dr. Meddlesomlle became  melancloly. he told his ftiienlds tlilt lo had got somol one to keep his house who ws not c:tapa- ble. Mts. Meddlesome thought it lunwise for a single wioman to undertake such /t burden as a boarding-house. Miss Ter- raphin bought a lot at Rlose Hill, and con- temnplated her fturte hom o  there with pleasure. She concluded slit must have mistaken her calling in life,. She struck a balance, finally, and, finding that she was on the wrong side of er nacoullnts anltocther, took the straiglit and nlarrow road to anothher field of labor. Music had -,been  Hecr forito in ]ler youtl,. Mftsic- ttacl1rs lived, Mnoved, and Ih:dd their being, and wliy not she? She took a lifall ibedroom in the fourth story of a frielnd's h1ouse till she could get a class formed. then she started on her weary pilrimage. Allherever a clhill was rolling lioop she tulrlned lher foot- stelps. At ldoor after door slei inllired if there were any children who wouldl take music-lessons!  she distribulted Ip'iited cards 1amon1 g all n lcr friiends, and tliose who ouglit to bo friendly. Sllo threw her whlole soul into the ente'llrprise. At tli end( of two mIontlis sleo iad1 ob- tained two pupils! I hardly know ].ow to accotnt for her want of success!  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7037-00000038"/> Most fanlilies, I dare say, had teachers already provided for their young people. Others thought she wai too oldl She called herself forty-five! I don't know whose business jt was if she had been forty-five for seven or eight years. Per- haps she had  conscientious scruples about getting any older. Forty-five is in my estimation quite old enough for an old maid. She struggled on for two or three years in a sort of transition state between existence and starvation. At one time she had five scholars, but, to get them, she had to take them  under the es- tablished price, and, in one instance, failed to collect that. She must dress well; not only  her natural tastes but her possible ultinmate success, de- manded it, and, being uncommonly tall, it was a serious drain upon her poverty- stricken pocket. Her friends tired, at last, of giving lher a gratuitous honme, and told her so. She looked for board, but single maiden ladies are not usually at a premium in that market. Gentlemennal- ways take the preference. Miss Terra- pin wondered at it, and no wonder she did  At one place sho ventured to ask the reason. The lady seemed surprised that she should not understand I B1ecause gentlemen are away all day, never conme to lunch, don't keep ser- vants always running to attend to their calls and their fires, have good appetites, and mind their own business." "Some gentlemen!" was Miss Ter- rapin's laconic reply. She found a place in the end, where, by sleeping on a sofa in the parlor, and helping the lady with her plain sewing, she could make a temporary lodgment.   She advertised for copying and earned a little thlat way. My aunt Hatty em- ployed her at one time to take charge of her house for a few months, while she was in Waslington. She had a gift at needle-work. For years, she had made her own dresses. I don't know what was the flaw in her understanding, that she should hlave been so long finding her proper level. But, at last, she rented rooms and opened a dress-making estab- lisliment. She succeeded, for' she had a natural talent lying in thlat direction, and while the world and Chicago stand peo- ple must dress. Her shop hung with the latest New York and Paris patterns, and theo back-room-revealed a dozen or more girls hard at work for their daily bread. Spicy asked her to step round and sde me, as we had several garments we wished made out of the house, and very little time to attend to it ourselves. She came in the evening and talked fast and said a great deal. I took note of it, be- cause some peolpe who talk fast never say any thing. She was thoroughly master of the- situation. She could tell me just what was suitable to wear in any emer- gency. She knew exactly how many pieces of wearing-apparel the young lady needed for her school-year. She secretly informed us what the prevailing styles would be in the winter and spring, and how much cheaper goods could be bought in Chicago than New York. She offered to attend to all my shopping for a tri- fling commission. A valuable acquisition to my circle of acquaintance, surely! Her name sud- denly became a household word.  It was: Ask Miss Terrapin about that; Miss Terrapin told me this. It will nev-   er do, Miss Terrapin says they are not worn. How many pockct-landkecrchicef did Miss Terrapin say I must have? Where is the sample Miss Terrapin sent me? This waist pinches, but Miss Terra- pin says it is none too tight. Miss Ter- rapin. says I do not walk good in high- heeled boots. Ask Miss Terrapin wheth- er it sliall be trimmed with fringe or lace; and similar expressions constituted the small-talk of thoe family. I did not see how I hiad ever done without Miss Terrapin! She was always laughing about lmy low ceilings. She could not stand erect, only on the hgh side of tleo blue-room. She said she should not like to be the one to go into that dungeon of a closet. She should expect such a place to be haunted. She did not believe in ghosts, but should never doubt any one's veraci- ty whlo said she had seen one in there. "Speaking of ghosts," she went on, "they have one good trait, they never do anybody any harm, and it always vexes me to see folks so stupidly afraid of them." "That is even so," replied Spicy; "don't you think some one ought to be- friend the poor creatures? lHere my ghost has been locked out of civilized so- ciety all summer, and now I suppose she would not come back even if we invited her. We ought to have treated her bet- ter, more as became her station among the spirits; it would have been so much more respectable, I mean for the ghost." 1 Tllis ribbon is too narrow, Mrs. Bel- mnore. I will stop at Palmer's and get you one the right width. You will find the lace cheaper at Shay's, and you will want a half-yard more to finish the un-   der-sleeves. Shall I giveo Mrs. Hopson your order 'or the hlat?" Miss Terrapin was standing with her bonnet and (gloves on, leaning over Spi-' cy's shoulder, who was persisting in great efforts to accomplish the joining of two rough pieces of ws ash-blond. We were in the blue-room, seam- stresses and all, and there was not much unoccupied space. I should hardly hlave known the hour if the lunch-Dch had not rung about that time, although it was plain that the sun had passed the moerid- ian, frol the way in whch it was blis- tering the outsidel of the green window- shutters. Thlo closet-door had not been shut since it was first unlockedl, and wo had all taken a turn in trying to admit air through thlo window, and maknl  tlo place less like an oven than it really was, but without success., It wans almost filled wiith finished garments, tossed loosely upon cach other, and the window could no longer be reached without creeping along where the shirp roof met the floor. It was decidedly darkish in there as well as hot, and four or five frieshy-ironled white skirts hitched on some hooks just by the door-way, rendered it darker and hotter stiil. All at once there came a silence that was in itself acutely painful It was as if a pall had suddenly been dropped over  every person present I No one breathed, much less spoke! All our eyes rested upon the figulre of a womllan looking at us fromn thile closet! she had tileo apIearanco of standling on the second sttep 'ldown, fand Held il her hand a scroll of p'lpe'. And sluch a hantd! So bony and attenuatedl! She was clad in whte raiment. No shroud,  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7037-00000039"/> but a wrapper 'of cross-barred muslin, with pearl buttotns! Her face was hag- gard and wan, her neck long and small, the veins and cords standing out prom- inently visible; her hair, drawn back plain from her high, sharp forehead, was caught up in a net; and her eyes, blacker than night, and fearfully glassy, wan- dered from one to another of our wliite, scared faces, with a terrified expression. It was not long, could not have been more than three seconds, that we thus regarded each other, the six and the one. Then the one wan3 gone, and not one of the six had the power to follow her! Some minutes elapsed, when Miss Terrapin rallied her forces, and proposed to one of the sewing-girlsl to see where that woman had gone. "I should rather you would under. take the job," was the reply. "I amn willing enoughll, but I am so long all in one direction, that I am afraid it would not be practicable." I was as one petrified!-not so much with absolute fear, although there is no use in denying the sensation, as in my utter inability to account for the phe- nomiienon. Spicy must have- been simi- larly affected-, for, letting her work slide under her feet, she started up, threw her- self into my arms, and burst into a fit of weeping almost hysterical. Miss Terra- pin tried to console hler. "It is nothing but some crazy person. Don't nmind it. She wouldn't touch a hair of your head. And she has gone, too-is half a mile away by this time, probably." "I Half a mile away! Miss Terrapin, if you will show me how she got awayn if sho has really gone, you will do me   the greatest kindness," exclaimed Spicy. "It is all very well to theorize over who or what she is or may be, but solve the problem of how she comes and goes, and I am ready to imagine the crazy part." "There is a trap-door, perhaps?" "No, there is not. We have investi- gated that matter thoroughlly."  "And the window?" "Is fitted tighter than the marriage- relation." "Are you sure?" "Try it for yourself!" "How can I get there?" "Bend as others have done before you." '"I will see what I can do, for your sake, Miss Spicy." She reached the door with a graceful stoop, and stepped down into the closet. "There is no one here. Now, if it is possible, I will give the window a sl;hake." Slie worked her way along to it, nearly putting her hand through a band- box on the route, and found it just as Spicy had represented. ' Whilen your dry-goods are taken out I should like to come in ihere again. If there is any sly panelling, I am just the one to detect it;" her voice sounded as if her lungs were packed in cotton'batting. She crawled back, scraping liher head against the roof, upsetting her bonnet anid wig. She looked as much like a ghost lherself as a human being could, when she landed at last in the blue-room. I should have volunteered to regulate her head-gear if she had not towered so hghl above me. She seemed quite dis- concerted when she looked in the glass, and saw hler gray hairs on exhibition. "It was hereditary in our family to   have the hair turn young," she remarked, by way of apology. Spicy choked.  I thought she was going to laugh, and stepped on her toes, "Why don't you use invigorators and make it stay the right color?" she asked, quite gravely. "Because they all contain sugar of lead,- which acts as a slow poison to the system. I know a lady who has been made totally deaf, and another has lost her eyesight, throughl its use. The physi- cians say death is frequently traced to tleo salme cause." "Iorrible! But why not let tile hair look as it will? I sco no need of dyeing it or covering it up either! I  like white hair for my part. I should not wonder if it was all in vogue sXome day.  If the fashion ever does come round, I sh11all b the first one to dye mine white or grnay color I " Mtiss Terrapin was getting lher locks and puls anld braids all straightened by that timCe. "Really," she said, i abollt that ghost or whatever she is, I a ml a good deal 1uzzled, I Imust confess. She looked to me like a thni  of flesh and blood, and yet her disappearance las a savor of tile supernatural. By-the-way, hlave you ever been into tihat gift-book store on Randolph Street? They will sell you a book as cheap as you can get it any- where else, and let you draw a prize. They have silver and jewelry and gold- pens and the like, and, last week, one day, I thought I would try my luck, and I got this thimble! It looks like gold, and wears just as well." We all took it and examined it, and passed jutdgnment upon it.   "Did you notice the ghost's handl? Wasn't it skcletony? Talking about the thimble reminded me of it, for she had on 'a very handsome gold thimble." I had not seen it, neither had Spicy. "It was on llher right lland, and sho held the scroll in her left," continued Miss Terrapin. "I am sure I sliall never forget hler. When Miss Spicy is fairly away, I will colno and dig into the mys- tery. You sec I am good for most any tling. If there is a ghtost indeed, weo will miako sure of it, and find out whoso murdered bones she represe'nt .." "Good for you, Miss Terralinl  I will remember you in my will!" ex- claimed Spicy.--'"Be s'ro and write me all about it, Meddlie. It will make such a nice variety for me in dulll New York; something for me to tell the girls after the rooms are dark, you know I " Years afterward, on a nevcr-to-blo-for- gotten night of horrors, both Spicy and Miss Terrapin were plunged into tho abyss of knowledge which they so much coveted, and the mournful yesterday of the ghost-closet was unriddled, to their shocked and awe-stricken comprehen- sions. CIHAPTEI R X. THE TRIP TO NEW Y0RK. Our trip to New York was in most respects a pleasant one. It rained when we arrived, but weo found a close car- riage, and were driven directly to Miss Gilbert's. We were shown into an clo- gant parlor, and in a few minutes kindly and cordially welcomed by the lady her- self. the room assigned to Spicy was1 on the fourth floor, and shlo was to h]avo  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7037-00000040"/> three young-lady companions.  They were not expected for a week, so I stayed with her until the next day.  Three teachers, all ladies of culture, met us at the dinner-table, and the bill of fare was so tempting that I was in a happy frame of mind, when we adjourned to the fam- ily sitting-room for prayers. ]Miss Gil- bert questioned Spicy about her music, and asked her to play. She compliment- ed her on her proficiency, and suggested one of the most popular masters. It was my desire that she should finish her course and graduate in two years, and Miss Gilbert saw nothing whatever to prevent. I administered the usual parental caution about never al- lowing the young lady to go in the street alone, and expressed myself decidedly opposed to her makling any gentleman acquaintances. Miss Gilbert gave me a digest of her rules and regulations, with which I was well pleased, and after saying a great many affectionate things, and giving continual advice from the time we went to our room until we left it the next morning, I bade my darlingt good-by for a' year. She shed a few tears, they were always ready to flow at her bidding; but she should be perfectly contented, she said, as soon as her trunk came,it would be such fun to take out all her new things, and stretchl them round in the closets, and arrange the or- naments on the bureau. "Whtat ornaments, deary? I did not know as you had brought any." "Oh, yes. My brush and comb, and ink-bottle, and my picture of Fred Gil- dersleeve." "Spicy to the last," I said, squeez- ing and shaking her.  "You know,   though, you are not to flirt with any- body." "Not even with Fred Gildersleevel Now, that is too much, Meddie I I have your kind permission to hunt for him, and if I should happen to find him I should be compelled to shake my pocket- handkerchief or give some sign. Could not help it. I hlave known him a long time. He is the one for me, who sticketh closer than a brother." "If you should find him! Very well. Wait till you do and then write to me," I said. "Meanwhile if that old, musty picture is any comfort, adore it to your heart's content." "Yes, cm11. That is what I shall do. Good-by-good-by-good-by!" And I good-byed 'until my eyes were as rainy as my sister's. I returned to Albany for a few days, but I was restless until I was in my little home again. It was a trifle quiet and still witlout either Leonardus or Spicy, but I managed to fill up my time. Bright was at the age when children develop fast, and his cunning ways were ex- tremely fascinating. I dipped into char- ities, and-church festivals, and musical soire'cs. The autumn was remarkable for pleasant days, and December ap- peared without any great chincago fireeze. I could not make up mry mlind to pass the holidays alone, so I sent out some invitations and prepared to entertain company. Spicy wrote me regularly every week. A few extracts from her letters will re- veal the tenor of her life in New York. From one, under date of October 7th, I clip the following: "I am just from the conversation-   hour. I forget whether I have told you what that is or not, so here goes. We take our work, embroidery or stockings to mend according to our proclivities, and go down to the back-parlor, where we meet mademoiselle and chat an hour in French-real Frenchl, as Mrs. )Wing used to say about her furniture. You re- member, don't you, how we called there just after her new house was built, and about her taking us up-stairs and telling us such and such articles were real rose- wood, and those wardrobes were lined with real cedar? I suppose she tlouglit wo had been accustomed to imitation all our lives, as she had. But about our Frenclh. I cannot help thinking that if a French- man were to drop in amiong us he would take us for real Greeks I I improve some, but I am positively disheartened about ever becoming a celebrated linguist. This is a good schlool, but I have discovered that it requires native genius to be a goodl scholar. We are particularly well drilled in the proprieties. Daily lectures free. the chief heads arc: to rise and give elders the easy-chairs, bow out of a room backwa'rd, pause when any one else is speaking, and never ask for butter the second tiine. My thrcee room-mates are expected to-morrow.  Their names are Miss Buffet and Miss Tuffet and Miss Buffet, as near as I can find out. My present anxicty is to know who will be entitled to the first chanco at the wash- standl! rerhaps we will draw cuts, or render courtesy to age, or submit the question to a council of arbitration 1 What an aggravation to have a front- room on Fifth Avenue and not blo al lowed to go within three feet of thI window! I hear the drum beat, nnd a   band of soldiers are passing, and yet I cannot look out without getting one of those horrid black mallrks! As a sort of let off to illy pent-up emotions, I have suspended Fred Giltersleeve by a blue ribbon in the middle of the window, to see for meI1." the next wans under dlate of October 9, 1862: "the subject of my to-day's letter is space. It seems just now as if it would b1e the subject of tall my future corre- spondence. Oh, for a cot in the wilder- ness or a spot to call my own I Send me your ghost-closet, and be my noble benc- factress. Do I want the ghost, too, did I hear you ask? Certainly, ift' she wants to come, for, I dare say, she would not try to monopolize mlly pegs with her clothes. If you believe, or if you don't, I havve but two pes! Just to think of it! But two pegs! There are but eight pegs in all, and, of course, I get llmy shareO; but, is it not dr'eadf'ull? Then I only have one bureau-drawer, and nmy trunk is in the sub-cell:lr, five flights of stairs away I "Miss ]Mufret was here last year, and says shoe got along very well after tho first week, although filll four-fifths of her clothes she did not see until spring! Mias Tuffert will manage, I guess, becau e shellc ls not but three ldreses wS ith er, and one is al ways put awny anyhow; but she grumbles awfully about room for her bows, for it is one of her follies to have one for every day in the year and two for Sundays. ]Miss Bufilt is in the same wretclhed condition thlat I iaml. Slie has brought an elepolanting cargo, and lins no place to put it nnd no clance to wear it. We hanve enoughl between us 9  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7037-00000041"/> to start a ready-made clothing-store in Kansas or California. What could Miss Terrapin have been thinking of? And it strikes me as absurd to have so much made-up outside of New York anyhow, for when we get here it isn't quite tile thing, with all due deference to Miss Terrapin, and, if it has got to be put over until next year, why, worse and worse! Miss Muffet says we don't need much at school, and I begin to think she is rilght. Miss Gilbert wisles to see us plainly dressed. She says'too much dress is in bad taste. I thought I would be stun- ning one Sunday afternoon, and appeared down-stairs in my blue silk, and was sent straight back to take it off I That was while my trunk stood by, me, like a friend in trouble. No danger of any such reproof hereafter. I shall wear my mouse- mlering till I tear or burn it, if it is until I graduate. My water-proof hangs with my cloak upon one peg, and my black- silk dress, blanlet-shawl, and umnbrella, assuage the loneliness of the other. "There is an elegant young man sits near us in churclh. He often steps back and waits while we pass down the aisle. Don't worry, Meddie; I practise the Christian graces and never look at him. I am going to grow up like Miss Terra- pin, the good old spinster! The only place where I have looked for Fred. Gil- dersleeve yet has been in the ' Directory.' he was not there, but ]Miss Muffct, who is our oracle, says that the first people in New York never are there. Harkl the study-bell! By-by, Meddie! Don't forget to send me some jelly-calo before Thanksgiving." We had some distant cousins living in New Jersey. The two young ladies   in the family were shining lights in fiash- ionable society. When they heard that Spicy was at Miss Gilbert's school, they called and invited her to spend the holi- day vacation with them. I had at first objected, as we were very slightly ac- quainted with the Gladstones, and I con. sidered my sister much too young for, the round of gayety such a visit would in- volve. But I was finally induced to con- sent, p)rovided she was treated under all circumstances as a school-girl. She wrote me but once while therc, but was enthusiastic in her description of the entertainments nlid amusements, whllich shhe was enjoying with a great relish. I was too busy to notice the length of timle which elapsed between her letters, but I was reminded of it af- terward when a very full double sheet came at a moment when I was binding up a sharp cut in dear little Bright's fore- head. He had fallen down-stairs, amnd Nursy Brown had been cut to the heart for having left him to get a glass of wa- ter. Two wounded ones, the latter the most seriously of the two, and, with an ashen face down which great scalding tears were trickling, she gave unerring evidence of a common humanity. I made her lie down on the bed, and in the rocker by her side I soothed and hushed the little one. When all was quiet, I broke open Spicy's letter and read aloud: DARLING M. EDDIE: I could not help it! The days slipped away so fast, and I had so little time to myself. I will not neglect yon any more if you will be for- giving. I nam back in my school safe and sound, and we have soup on Mondays and fish on Fridays as usual. The New-   Year's ball w-as a prodigious aftair. Cousili Suo wore diamnonds and point- lace,  and w-ns tleo cho  of the evening. I was the counltry miss ir white muslin, with a pink tunic trimmed with down. Cousin Julia was sick, and did not go. That is why I did not mention her be- fore myself-according to Mis Gilbert. "I expected to keep the wall-flowers company, talk with the n1amllinas, and see how the ladies imana' ed their trails, and was perfectly aghlast when I  mflund, bcforo the end of the first half-llour, that little nme wais engaged for every dancl I I suppose it was out of respect for imy grand relations.

I saw him several times afterward, but ho was always devoted to some lady, and never noticed me nagain.  I tried to imagine that he was theo original of my picture, but I did not see much resem- blance, if the truth must be told. He is a great deal the handsomer of the two. I pointed him out to Cousin Sule nd in- quired if she know him; but no, only she said ho was the most distinguished- looking gentleman in thoe room. I was 6   in despair. Blut Illmy little ro1lli1nce ex- ploded as we were getting into our car- riage to go home. I heard somebody shout, 'This way, Ilildegroovo, ti s way,' and a tall figure ran past, whom I  recor- nized as my hero. "Thoe morniig before I came back to Now York, I drew the window-shade up about daylight and found it raining. T slept with Cousin Suo, and she must have been trying to join the two parts of a dream togethelr just then, for she inum- bled : 'You cant wear my overshoes and umbrella.'

But wo were kept thero waiting for the ferry-boat a long time. Some tr:tin was just in, and a hearse was in waiting. Walter made inquiries, and told me that it was the body of Brig- adier-General Lewis Vance, who had been killed in n skirmish near Fredericks-  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7037-00000042"/> burg, Virginia, and was being conveyed to Boston for burial." I stopped reading and looked sharply at Nursy Brown, but her face was cov- cred with the corner of the pillow, and she gave no sign of interest or intelli- gence. \'So many passengers coming upon the boat from the steam-cars made it very crowded. Walter gave his seat t6/li old lady with a bundle, and stepped a little beyond me to speak to sonie ono whom ho knew. Before the boat was quite to the dock the crowd all pushed forward, and who should I see but my lord of the long name I He was quite a way off, and kept his distance; never once looked at me, and I was thankful I Oh, how muddy it was at the foot of Cortlandt Street I Black and slip- pery and soft, as if some one had been moulding grease into the soil for ages! It takes all the conceit out of the most pompous to go through. itl Standing on some corner waiting for an omnibus, Cousin Walter did something to my water-proof. I thought he was shaking off mud, and told him ho would have better luck when it got dry. He is a man of large ideas and few words, and I was not surprised that he deigned me no answer. He never thinks I am worth talking to. But who should I sit down beside in that very omnibus but Mr. IIil- degroove, or whatever his name is He lifted the nicest kind of a ,hat, and dis- played beautiful wavy hair, and hoped I was quite well. Cousin Walter looked fire-daggers at me, but how could I help making my best manners back to him? Was there any sin in it? And how --*a I to know that Cousin Walter wanted )   an introduction limself? and how could I have introduced a person whose name I did not know, even if I ought to have known it?  I was terribly uncomfort- able, with Cousin Walter's disapproving eyes fixed upon me from the opposite seat, but the gentleman said nothing more, and at last I landed at my school. "Now, the funny part is to come. I ireceived a note from Cousin Sue next day, telling me how Walter asked her Jwhen he got home what a tuck and a flounce was. She illustrated with her pocket-handkerchief. "' Well,' he says, 'if you expect me to be polite to that little Western girl, you must try to put some style on her. I was not at all pleased this morning with the fit of her outside garment, and succeeded in getting a tuck and a flounce into it, which was some improvement. A gentleman whom I often see in the gold-roomn recognized her in the stage. I suppose lh has met her at some of tho parties where she has been with you. He is one of the hi-fai-leuin, who always win in the money market, and the New- York belles csteem him a great chtch. If he knew me, as lie probably did, al- tlough we have no acquaintance, he must have thought I was in great busi- ness toting that little dowdy roundl ' "Sue said she thought it was a good joke on Walter for being SO puffed out with cheap pride. Between ou and Is Meddie, he is a veritable coxco I! But the water-proof It had been hungl, down-stairs somewhere to dry, and I ran and got it to see for myself, and, true as gospel, it was pinned and hitched up in ever so many places! What a figure I must have cut I ,-f   "You will write to Lconardus about General Vance, won't you? I would if I knew where he was stationed. Was it not singular about my coming upon that hearse at the ferry? "We are going to have gingerbread for lunch. The bill of fare is coming up through the speaking-tubes. Miss Buf- fet has got a box from home-candies, and oranges, and sweetmeats, enough to keep the attending physician in business for a month to cone, as Miss Muffet says. She is going to treat us this even- ing after the monitor has been round. Miss Gilbert has seen my picture of Fred Gildersleeve, and given mo a little pri- vate advice. She says I am too young to love. Those are not her precise words, but that was the drift of them. No young lady should cherish a picture, unless it was of her brother, or some near kin. Books now, society in the future. I played melancholy and kissed Fred, and she said she must write to you on the subject. Good-by again, but only for a week. I will be as prompt hereafter as a man at the funeral of his wife. "Your loving sister,  SPICY." Bright was fast asleep when I had finished reading, and so was Nursy Brown, as near as I could discover. I laid him on the foot of the bed a4d cov- ered him up warm. The fire was get- ting low, and I put on some coal. Then I had my hands to wasl. Nursy did not move.  I never knew her to go to sleep before in the daytime I How strange But she had had such a shock when Bright fell! No, I would not dis- turb her for the world! I went and brought my portfolio to   the nursery to write to Leonardus. lIo was down on the Mississippi, and it took my letters a long itime to reach him. He saw newspapers but seldom, so lie prob- ably had not leard of General Vancc's death. I had been scratching away for an hour, when Bright began to nestle, and then opened his eyes. I took him in my arms and talked and sang to him; the sun went down. Maggie came in and lighted the gas, and finally the dinner- bell rangi  Nursy Brown  had not moved. I must speak to lher; she cer- tainly would not care to sleep any lon- ger. So, rising, I laid my hand on her arm. "What is it?" she asked, without stirring. "I thought you would like to have me wake you." "Yes, I am obliged to you." "I hope you are not sick?" "No, thank you." But sIhe did not offer te rise. She did not look at me even. "Shall I leave 1,.bay with you or take him with me?" I asked the question deferentially, for she had settled all thoso little ques- tions for so long that I never thought of interfering with ier programme. "' Take him, if you please." She had not como down for him at eight o'clock, so I carried him up to her. She was lying where I had left ler, in tile same position, except that her litilo beauty of a hand was clasping her pearl- whito throat. "You must be feeling badly? I will undress baby," I said, stopping b)y the bedside.  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7037-00000043"/> "Very well."  "Can't I do something for you?"I asked. "No, thank you." I was nonplussed; what should I do? Go away from her if shilo were suffering, without persisting in efforts to relievo her? I felt that I had been dismissed, but ought I to acknowledge the dismis- sal? Bright had no idea of such a thing. if I had, and, as soon as costumed for the night, put in his voice effectively. His mamma did not stand on a par with his nurse in his youthful estimation. "Please leave hihn with me," she roused herself to say, as I was trying to force him from the room against his will. He had carried his point, and was cor- respondingly mollified-even put his sweet lips out toward me for a make-up kiss. And so I left them. She appeared next Iorning as usual, and attended to all her duties. I was out most of the day, and saw very little of her. The following week I spent in Mil- waukee, and after that I was very busy with a new society, which had been or- ganized for the relief of soldiers' fami- lies; and blustering March, with all its cold and dust, was upon us. I seemed to feel as if some great ca- lamity was going to befall me. I was not subject to fits of depression, but spring months are hard to get over at the West unless one has an iron consti- tution. I tried to lay it to the weather, then I took some medicine for dyspepsia. I read all the war news before sis o'clock in the morning also, to try to get up an appetite for my breakfast. Leonardus wrote often and hopefully. As yet, he   had not received a scratch in battle, and his health was excellent. But the affairs of the country were very muicl mixed, and there was no telling where our troubles would end. How I did miss Spicy!   But she would be with me all summer, after the middle of June! I counted the days un- til then. I would try to cast off the clouds which were obscuring the brightness of my present-"Live them down," as MisI Terrapin often said. "Enjoy life as it, passes, so as to be still young fWhen you4 are old," is her motto, and, "Never bor- row trouble until it comes," might beo added with advantage. I did not have to borrow it, my trou- ble came sure and swift, aud far too' soon I A note was left on my t able one morning, which I read several times be- fore I could believe the evidence of- nly own senses. It was from Nursy Brown, "MY DEAR MRs. BELMOrE': I have been trying for several days to nerve my- self for the parting which cannot longer be delayed. Your baby has coiled himn- self into every fibre of my heart, and your own kindness will be gratefully re- membered while life lasts. But Fate so wills it, and I have fixed the time for my departure on Thursday nest. I could, not bring myself to the point of holding any conversation with you on the sub- ject, and, since I shall suffer most by the breaking of the ties which bind me here, I beg that you will not allude to the sub- ject by word or note, while I remain un- der your roof. "With sincere regard, "Nunsy BROWN."   CIHAPTER XI. MRS. BELMORE ,ANNOT BE COMFORTED. IT WAS as if my right arm had been amputated I I never 1knew, until she was gone, how much I was indebted to Nur- sy Brown for the home-comfort and peace of mind of the last year and a half. Bright had grown quite beyond me, kiow better how his clothes ought to bo pat on than I did myself, was inclined to play horse with iny sash-ribbons and curtain-cords, and could run the fastest and catch the hardest colds of any boy of two years in all North America. I employed a young, tidy-looking girl to take care of him, but to fill the place of the one I had lost was not among hu- man possibilities. And every portion of the house showed that there hiad been a change. The pictures hung awry, and the mantel- ornaments leaned the wrong way. the music persisted in getting at sixes and sevens, the books wero no longer ar- ranged 'on the shelves in the order of the volulles, the newspapers had a way of lying round where thhey pleased, and the cat slept on the parlor-sofa. The cook, too, calme to me for instruc- tions, every morning, and, it was so tirt- some to always keep the bill-of-fare filled out; besides, there was my linen to be looked over, and my silver to be count- ed, once a week. It was not that I was indolently disposed, or unequal to the task of managing my household aff airs, but simply that the care had been taken from my shoulders, and so smoothly and skilfully managed, that the house had had the appearance of running itself. The very atimosphero was an aching void,   I could not reconcile myself to it easily. It was as if some portion of my life had gone ont, never to return. I wanted to malko her a present be- fore sheo left, since I could in no other tway express my appreciation of her dis- interested services. But I was at a great loss to decide what it should be. I hit upon various articles of dress, but r(ject- ed them immediately, for I fancied she would not receive any such gift from me. Finally, I decided to get Bright's picture taken on ivory, and the last thing beforl she passed over my threshold I placed it in her hands. What a look slo gave Ino!-so fill of tender, regretful mcaning I "May God bless you I!" she salid, and that was all. Bright cried for her every nilght and morning, and whenever there was a hlll in hs plays, during the day, fo)r weeks. It kept my sorrow frosh in Imy heart, and, when my baby's birthday camo round, I could not get up tlbo proper measure of enthusiasm over it-not even when the little voice put in liis quories: "Ware Bight's birf-day? Bight's birf- day up-stairs?  Baun dot Bight's birf- day?" Spicy condoled with me as soon as she hoard of my misfortune. "I thought you would keep her for- ever, and that at llher deathl she would declare herself an empress, and makoe us all prime-ministers' wives. All, means you and me, for what splendid repro- sentatives Leonardus and Fred Cilder- sleevo would be at court!" "The little goosel "I could not help stopping to exclaim. --"Every    thing  about her was  &#xD;<pb n="86" xml:id="VAC7037-00000044"/> perfectly regal. The very sort of a per- son whom I should have taken off my hat to, if I had been a man. I do pity you from the bottom of my heart, Med- dio. But you must consider how greatly blesspd above other women you have been by having had her to live with you at all, instead of declaring yourself the most miserable of beings because she has left you. Where do you suppose she has gone? Sentherlittle, old, black trunk to the Great Central Depot, did she? East- ward boundl If I had been there, she would not have got off without some quiz- zing; but, as you say, if she had a secret to keep, she would keep it to the death, and all my feeble ingenuity would proba- bly have failed to surprise it out of her. "We have had the greatest time with our gasI It gave such a splendid light in the first part of the winter I But for weeks and weeks it has been worse than any tallow-candle I We could not see to study Ly it, and had to go'to the school- room, and, if we wanted to write a com- position or a letter in the solitude of our apartments, it could not be done, and Miss Tuffet could not say her prayers (she is an Episcopalian, and reads them), so we appointed ourselves a committee of investigation to find what we could find. And what do you guess we did find? Cotton stuffed in the burners  A specimen of New-York economyl And what do you guess we did Pulled it out, every speck, and put it in a bottle for a keepsake! Would not you have done the same? We have light enough for a million now, and, if it gets dim, we shall know the remedy hereafter. "I think Miss Gilbert is a gem of a woman, and not a grain too strict, for   we are a hard set to nAanage. But, Med- die dear, what is it that makes poor, sin- ful mortals always want to go by the rule of contraries? For instance, it is a capital offence to read novels. I never cared for them before, but, since I have heard so much said about it, I can't pass a paper-stand without my feet begin to twist, and I sometimes hinder the whole procession long enough to see if there is a yellow cover in sight. We send Bob, the colored boy, to buy them for us, and, as he cannot read a word, he selects ac- cording to color? We hide them in our beds and devour them while the world is dreaming. We used to buy our own candles, and squeeze into the closet, and take turns about reading aloud, but since we have saved the institution such a bill of expense on gas, we consider ourselves entitled to a bonus, so now we Ipin aN our'black dresses up to the window and wedge the cracks of the door, and turn the gas up as high as it will go, and have a gay time. "We have just had a fast-day-meet- ings in the churches to pray for colleges. I suppose they got through with primary and boarding schools long ago, and that is why we had bread-pudding for dessert as usual. Our monthly holiday was last Saturday, and nearly all the teachers, as well as the girls, had some place to go and visit, and it was stupid enough for Miss Buffet and me, who wereleft behind. So what did we do, but ask Miss Gilbert for some one to take us to Stewart's, to buy some gloves? We were just out, hadn't a pair to our hands, could not go to church the next day unless we were supplied (don't you ever tell of it, but we gave all we were possessors of, that  &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-87" xml:id="VAC7037-00000045"/> very morniig, to little Bob to distribute among his sisters and friends). It was the esxat truth that we were tollin, I "e knoew that BMiss Gilbert had no teacher to send with us, but we hinted that the house-keeper would do just as well; we would recompense her for the trouble, of course. Miss Gilbert reluc- tantly consented, and clarged us to bo back before lunch, which we faithfully promised. The house-keeper is a kind of Miss Terrapin-believes just as anybody else does that she is with. Not that Miss Terrapin hlas no mind of lher own H-I ought not to say that, particularly after that ghost-hunt!--but is agreeably in- clined to what she thinlks you most agreeably inclined. Her name is Dobbs. Whenever we complain, Dobbs is on our side. If weo want to pretend sick to get rid of a lesson, she 'always declares it is mean f6r us to be kept in our rooms and bo fed with tea-and-toast, and have a doctor called in. If we are late to a meal, she always puts in a word of com- miseration about the unfairness of the rule that we ilmust take it cold. Yes, she was just the person we wanted with us that day. We whispered somethingr in her ear in the stage, and slie- nodded acquicscence. We bought our gloves, and an extra pair for Dobbs. Then we stoered for I)elrnonico's. "Such a lunch ns wo n dered I And how the waiters bow .e and run for us I Miss Buffet was for calling for every dish on the bill-of-faro that was now and strange to her, for, she said, it was a treat educational opportunity, and wo ought to embrace it.

"We carried on our conversation in low tones, for the waiters kept hovering about, as if they suspected something  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7037-00000046"/> wrong. The longer wo sat there, the more embarrassed we became, and the less prospect there seemed of getting out of our-dilemma. "At the table next us, near the win- dow, two gentlemen had been feeding on one small quail ever since we came in. I sat so that I could not see them very well; but Dobbs, who had a full-view, had once or twice remarked that it was sheer affectation for grown-up men to pretend that they had such delicate appe- tites It did not interest me then so much as it has since. The one with his back toward us rose suddenly, turned round and put out his hand, and said: "' Good-morning, Miss Merriman.  I am happy to meet you again,' and then walked directly into the street.

I have written half a dozen pret- ty little notes and torn them up again, and finally concluded to inclose my sim- ple card, with the two dollars wrapped round it, in an envelop, and not say a thing. But I don't know his name for sure, and I don't know whore he lives; and how shall I ever get it to him? I might ask Cousin Walter, perhaps, but I don't expect to go over there again be- fore the summer-vacation, and if I should write a  note, and tell him  the cir- cumstances, ho would be sure to report me at headquarters, tand have me put in a strait-jacket, for ho is the most fini- kin of mortals.

Miss Terrapin carne to see me often,   and always brought somea new fashion with her. It was a diversion, and I en- couraged hor in doing so. One day she ' spoke of a customer, a charming lady, I x;ho paid her bills in advance, and was such a model of elegance in her tastes. "Sho, abhors trimmings, but brings nlo the richest goods in thoe market to make up plain, and. never wears blue," shie said, one day. It was in May or June, the latter part of tlmo olne, or thlo fore )art of theo other. I remember, because she was fit- ting mI otut to go for Spicy. "That is unusual," I replied.  "I have known several ladies who were sworn enemiies to greenii, but blue is a favorite color. Few reject it altogeth- or. " "It would bo exceedingly becoming to her, I am sure," continucd Miss Ter- rapIin. "But there is no use in saying a word. Every thing is gray, black and o rasy, except two or three white wrap- pers for home-wear.  She has a large property. I never knew it until yester- day, but she ownsa thoe block which my shop is in, on Lake Street. She asked me what rent I paid, annd, when I told her, she remarked: 'That is too mnuch to ilm- pose upon a woman.   It shall bo attend- ed  to.' She inherited the property from an uncleo, old Judge Shubill, of De- troit-" I interrupted her by a start, and the question- "Wlat-is the lady 's name?" "Vanco,  M[rs. I. 1. Vanco, her card' reads," ; W1here dots sh0 live ? 1 "Just below  you hero, on the ave- nue. Not moro than two   blocks, or a   block and a half. Why? do you know her?" "Certainly lnot. lBut I h1ave heard of her." And then I checked myself; for it did not seem right to gossip with a person of Miss Terrapin's well-known gossipy charalcter, about the sacred secrets of a stranger, which had come to my knowl- edge in such a singular manner. She was curious. Where had I heard of her? How had I heard of her? What had I heard of her? Was sho a widow? 1ow long had she been a widow? IL:ld sho any children?  And many moro qulls- tions of the sanio sort, s11b plied witl1 practised dexterity. Some I answered by asking others the real Yankeo do()(g, as Leonardtus usted to say, and some  otherwise evaded. But upon the whole I gained more information than my dress maker, and congratuated myself that she had nothing new to tell her next cnustomer, from having discussed the subject with ino. But I wrote Longrdus a long letter that eiinr , iandh ( told him telo news. Icw I should like to to call upon her! but it will never do, unless I meet her somewhere first, for. I cannot refer to your acquaintance with General Vance without tearing open a terrible wound," was one of the closing clauses in the epistle. Although it ewas lato w1lmen I fin- ished his letter, I could not seek nmy pillow until I iad dashed off aL few lines to Spicy.  I could well imagine lhow sho would clasp her little handsl  togetler, and exclaim, "Miss Terrapin foreverl " I told her in the same sheet what t ly to expect me, fnd enjoined it upon her to  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7037-00000047"/> be all ready, even to the strapping of her trunks, as I was unwilling to leave Bright any longer than necessary. Miss Terrapin volunteered to come and sleep in the house while I was away. I accepted her, for I could not put my finger on any one else more acceptable. That expression, translated into broad English, signifies that I prefer as a rule to open my doors to the intimate rela- tionship ofsuch people as will not count the long stitches in my towel-hems, and read all the letters that happen to lie around loose. I started at night; ten-o'clock train on the Michigan Southern Railroad. Put baby to sleep first, and had a spell of the heartache. No more ease for me now, when I left him behind. Took a sleep- ing-ear of course, and lay awake all night. Iad a sick-headache next day, and was sullen to the lady who was so selfish as to crowd into the seat beside me. Emptied my lunch-basket out of tile window, all but an orange, which I gave to a little boy, who would persist in pounding me on the shoulder.  I thought it would take up his attention for a while, but he only struck me with the fruit. He stood on his mother's lap, and she, no doubt, thought it a pity to - interfere with her darling's happiness. I looked round, and the child uttered something between a screech and a groan, and I saw that he was deaf and dumb I, How my feelings changed! [My heart went out in one broad gush of sym- pathy for the afflicted pair, for I saw at the same moment that the mother was a deaf-mute also! She was fair to look upon, and her face beamed with intelli- gence. I knew a little of the language,   and commenced a conversation, which we kept up until our midnight arrival in New York. Her husband was with her, a fine-looking gentleman, and, as they were going to the St. Nicholas as well as myself, he kindly took me under his charge. In the morning, early, I was at Mtiss Gilbert's door. The school had closed three days previously, and Spicy was the only one of the pupils remaining. She had obeyed my instructions, and her trunks stood in the hall. I settled all her unpaid bills, expressed my thanks to Miss Gilbert for her kind and motherly care of my sister, drank a cup of tea in her parlor, as I declined lunch, ordered the trunk sent to the depot in time for the Western evening train, and fancied my duties all and well discharged, wLen Spicy caught hold of my arm: "One thing more, Meddic; come up- stairs, please." I climbed those long four flights, and reached the sky-parlor panting. "I hope it is something important, after all this trouble," I said. "Indeed it is!' I want you should get this two dollars to Mr. llildedragon. I never can go to Chicago without it is paid I did not know debts were such awful things before I It spoils every mo- ment of my life " "But how do you expect me to do it?" "I don't know at alll You are so clever you will be able to hatch up a way, I am sure. Go to Cousin'Walter and makb believe something, so as to find out where the gentleman lives or has an office, and then go and give it to him yourself, or hire a boy. Oh, dear!   don't shake your liead, you are my sis- ter, and I have nobody else to ask." "It' is a difficult task. You forget that I am just as. much of a stranger to Walter Gladstone as to Mr. IIilde- dragon! Seems to me you called himn by a different name froml that when you wrote to me about it?" I dare say; I don't know what it is. 'It almost kills me." "What, the name?" "No. I can't stand any ridicule, Mieddie.

I can't live so any longer!" "It is rather hard, deary," I said, throwing my arm  about the pretty, rounded figure at my side, and imprint- ing a kiss or two upon the rosy lips which were pleading with such genuine earnestness for an impossibility. "You will have to make the best of a bad bargain, for all I can see, though. Mischief brings its own reward, don't it? Who will give away gloves again for the sake of a shopping-expedition, I wonder? I cannot help you. Tlle two   dollars you will h ave to keep until such time as you can return it in'a suitable manner." "That time never will come, Meddie. It is weeks since it has been sco(rcling all the linings out of my pocket-books! It is as much worse than the ghost of blue-room notoriety, as tie ghost was worse tIhan Miss Terrapin's wig. Dear, dear, whtat sh:ll I do?" "'Forget it now, say your good-bys, and we will go. We are to have an early dinner at the hotel." She was bathed in tears when she put her arms round( Miss Gilbert's neck for a parting kiss. "Our young ladies dmlo't, leave for their homes with joy-beoaiing coiinto- Ilances, as they do in some schools," re- marked the good lady. ' No, indeed c  We leave too many unpaid debts belind  us," blubbered Spicy. CITAPTE1I XII. MRS. BELMOIE S I:EsTUIRN TO CHCAGO. AT o'clock on a bright JunIe morn- ing and a great black train, will its fiery eye and living load, rumbled slowly over the waters of Lake Michigan, in front of the avenuo where stood my unpreten- tious little home. How eagerly Spicy and I, from one of the sleeping-car win- dows, searched with pur eyes through the dense foliage which surrounded it for some sign of life I But for a moment. Into the depot we plunged, and fathers of families, mothers and daughters, chil- dren and nurses, small boys and single men, elderly maidens and pretty widows at  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7037-00000048"/> -with their satchels and bundles and wraps-simultaneously arose, and pushed and struggled for precedence in the dark aisle, and jostled each other on the steps, and scattered up and down the plat- form, hurrying into stages and hacks, and meeting friends with affectionate greet- ings, while trunks banged from the bag- gage-car in rapid succession, and check- numbers were shrieked in the universal din. It was not far, .but it would take us much too long to walk, so we stepped into the nearest coach, and, were driven rapidly to my own door. "There i's Miss Terrapin! What a figure is hers I Look, NMeddie I She reaches the roof as she stands on the northeast veranda I What should I do with mlyself if I were as tall as she is!" exclaimed Spicy, as wo approached. "There is my baby, too; so every thing is all right," was my remark, as tho driver snapped open the door of the carriage to let us out. "Any news?"I asked, as i sat down to a steaming breakfast. "There are some letters for you in your room," replied Miss Terrapin. I sent Maggie up for them. One from Leonardus; one from Aunt Minerva, asking us into the country for a week; and one from-it took me some time to find out who. "The ladies from five or six different States have held a meeting since you left, for the purpose of trying to organ- ize a sanitary-fair committee," said Miss Terrapin. "Ahl now I understand. This letter is from  Mrs. Waldemar, of Milw-aukee, asking me to interest myself in the en-   terpriso. But I cannot-positively can- not. It will take me away from my home too much. And Master Bright cannot spare his mamma-can lie, pre- cious?" and I turned the little face , which had been nestling in my neck while I drank my coffee, up toward mine. "Bight tan go, too?" "Not very well. No, we will let the Sanitary Fair take care of itself this year, and we will remember the soldiers by packing a big box full of every thing that is good to eat, and shipping it straight to your papa, won't we, baby?" "Mo no baby I Me big boy-me humbug l" said the little one. "He has had a new teacher for a few days," and I laughed and pinced his cheeks.  Miss Terrapin laughed too, and was evidently flattercd. "I don't wonder that Nursy Brown stayed with you so long, since I have had little Bright to amuse me. I am not par- tial to children generally, but I could not get away from him yesterday until four o'clock in the afternoon I And I should not have gone then only I had promised Mrs. Vance to fit a sack-lining, and I went down to her house a moment to do it. I told her what had kept me, and what a dear little fellow he was, and she seemed greatly interested, and asked me to come back and get him, so that she could see him.' We dressed him up like a doll, and he did look too sweet for any thing I knew you would be, quite will- ing for me to take him anywhere I chose, and when Mfrs. Vance expressed fears lest you should object to his being brought to a stranger's house in your   absence, I shut her up at once by ex- plaining the terms of intimacy we were on, and how much you relied on llmy judgment in every matter of importance. I told her all about your antecedents; how your grandfather was the governor of a State and your father a member of Congress, and how your mother was once presented to the Queen of England, and how your husband's ancestors were related to the royal family, and whllat hlonors were being heaped upon him in the army now. I think she has very hgh notions, and I tliought I would just givo her to understand that some people are as good as others. She thought I3right was splendid, and held him in her arms a lonog time, and kissed him, and rolled his hair over hler fingers to make it curl, and t:lught hil to call him- self a humbug. Ho rememilbers it, the little monkey. But I never know when to stop talking. I mlust go. I havo been away from my shop now so long that very-likely the nlice are all at play. My things are up-stairs in Miss Spicy's room. I can get them. Don't rise. I shall be in to see you often. Let me know a few days beforehand when you want your dresses imade. Good-morning." Spicy and I looked at each othlc after she was fairly on the sidewalk. We had a good many thoughts in common, which it was quite as wise to leave unsaid. Miss Terrapin was building her castles rather high, upon the strength of her importlance to me in my daily walk and conversation. Yet, it was not so strange that she should after all, for I had the appearance and must have passed for a weak-minded woman, and my very de. pendence on her must havo led her into   the adoption of her present theories. It would have been more pleasant not to have known how she was representing me and mine in the other houses where business took her, but someo evils areo Ic- cessary to our' well-beinig. '"Who cares?" said Spicy, after t while. "Don't wear such a lugubrious face, my good sister." "I was only thining." "So I supposed. But I would not think. I wish I could get a glillpse of Mrs. Vance." "You probably will, as shil must pass here very often if she lives so near us." "How long did you say it was since she came to reside on this street?" "I did not ask Miss Terrapin." Days succeeded days in a round of pleasant occupations. Spicy was like a bird set free fromn a cage, and sang all the day long. I was happy to have her witl me, and potted and laughed at her ac- cording to her moods. SomeU days slbe was in a severe fit of celibacy, and de- clared she should never marry.  Men were too frivolous and exacting. No one worthy of tlao priceless treasuro of her nffections would ever be HO fortunate as to discover their existence. Thleln out would come the picturo of Fred Gilder- sleeve, and it woull bo wreathed with myrtle or forget-mc-n1 - and hung on the knob of her bureau-drawer, or near- est the place where she happened to bo sitting, and she would declare herself thawed out under the genial influence of his perpetual smile, and ask how malny pairs of pillow-cases it would be neces- sary for her to embroider with a mono- gram before she should bo ready for her wedding-trip I  !  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7037-00000049"/> We went out to see Aunt Minerva after a while, taking Bright with us. Phil was there, too, with his mother. J house full of guests in the country cre. ate a succession of enjoyments, and we allowed not a moment to go to waste. Spicy distinguished herself, as she had done on a previous occasion, by her horsemanship, and she grew more plump and rosy every day. Phil was always by her side, whether in the little dog- cart or on the pony's bachk, and many a long, sunny morning they idled away beside a brook at the foot of the gar- den. "Look at themI " said Aunt Hatty, one day as we were standing on the piazza. "Phil lhas found out who is the prettiest girl in Illinois, without of- fence to any of my other pretty nieces and friends present." "What is he doing? holding her hand!" exclaimed Aunt Minerva, ad- justing her spectacles.-"Harriet, that is most too familiar for cousins. They must be spoke to about it." Dinner was announced, and they did not come in directly. Uncle James went to the door and halloed to them. They did not move as rapidly after that as I have known people to do who were suf- fering with hunger. "Hey, Phil, what you been about?" was Aunt Minerva's salutation, as he took his place at the table. He dropped his eyes and appeared confused. "Ia, h, ha!" lalughed Uncle James. "I will stake a bushel of wheat that you've been picking clover-blossoms. No0no of that on my farm.-How is it, Miss Spicy?"   "I don't know, sir," and she blushed deeply. "Oh, you don't I I thought you were there I But Phil sha'n't be teased in my house, nor you either. You are a nice little pair of thieves, although Phil is not so very little. I will see that Aunt Minerva don't disturb you; it is a good thing for relations to be relationy--ha, ha, ha!"  Plhil prided himself upon his immo- bility and self-possession, and was gain- ing the ground which he had so un- warily lost. Iie bowed, admitting the joke, but showed very plainly that he did not think it was any great joke after all. Spicy did not smile, or otherwise in- dicate her appreciation of Uncle James's remarks. His humor was well known, as also his thorough good-nature, and it was hardly to be supposed that the young people had taken offence. But some- thing had happened. I qucstioned Spicy as soon as we were alone. "I will tell you all there is to tell, Meddie, but pray don't ever mention it to a soul. I have piqued Phil. More than that, I think I have mado him downright angry.  You know  I hlave always liked him, that is, I always found something to commend in him, although I have said so many times-and you have heard me say it--that he was fashioned out of very cheap material and inordi- nately vain. Since we have been here he hns been trying to see hosw much foolish flattery I could stand, and lie has found out. lIo has taken every oppor- tunity to look straight into my eyes, and tell me I was fai'r, and all that, and I have looked it right back every time, and   told hithe was charnming. I thought it was a game I could play at as long as he could, but I never dreamed he was going to come the sentimental and make down- right love!" "And has he?" "Yes, Meddli, this very morning; And I have crammed his heart till into those dainty gaiters hoe wears, and I dare say it aches, or he thinks it does." "What did he say? :" "Every thng in the way of love- nonsense. How wishy-washy it all is, isn't it? Didn't it make you sick? I never shall get mairried if I have got to listen to such trash first!" "The difference is whether you love or not." "I can't understand it. Phil is a ninny! He might have known I did not care a pin for him! Do let us go' back to Chicago to-morrow. I Ilato the country " We did not go on the morrow, be- cause Ph1il strapped up his knapsack af- ter breakfast and went to the depot. But a few days later wo took the t-enty- five-mile ride, and throw open our shut- ters once loro. Miss Terrapill discovcrcd us before night. Spicy declared that she must have been hanging round in a balloon. Business was extremely dull with her. So many people had gone East, and to the mountains and lakes. Mrs. Vance was in Minnesota, and would not return until late in September. She had plenty of timeno to work for us. We had, how- ever, much less for her to do than last year, for Spicy llad become wiser since going to New York, and was determined on a limit to her baggage in the future.   "Ioow long did you say AllS. Vance had lived on lichigan Avenule?"I p quired.              y "Several months, or-1 really don't know how long she hadl been there be- fore she called on l; but, judging froll her convcrsation, I should  sy someo time." "You are about ,as definite, as Mrs. Audlaw, in giving a reccipt for her po- tato-puddling," remar'ed Spicy. "How was that?" "Don't you klnow? Whly, sho said, 'If you wanted it large you luust tak e moro four, or if you wanlted it sm:th you must taklo less.' And then about tlio butter, 'Some folks liled it slort, and some folks didn't; if you liked it short you must pullt in rmore butter, but if you didn't like it short you mllust put in less.' And so with all the othor intgrodients, particularly the sawectening. And then as to the matter of baling, the tiOne of keeping it in the oven must all (deplnd upon the size of the puddling. It was .o0 definite I And the pudding must lhav been so delicious when   it was mai:sde right--that is, if you liked potato-Ilud- ding "  Miss Terrapin ]laughled. "IDoes  Mrs. Vance live (,ntirely alonec?"I asked. "Oh, no; sho hias an clderly;lady, ia Mrs. Chanftierlec-sistel, I think, oi sister- in-law  she must 1)e, of Juldg  Sillll-- with her. Shlo always calls he l;, Aunt M3ary,' but I don't believe she is my re- lation of Mrs. Yance.  Then Mnr i. Chaf- ferlee has a young son, a lad of nineteen or twenty, with lher now."  I "Call a  young man of ninleteen or twenty a lad do you?" excl:lined Spicy.  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7037-00000050"/> "He is not much more than a lad' anyhow, although hoe is trying to raise a mustache, and wears a stove-pipe hat. He is at what I call the foolish age, neither man nor boy. Perhaps lad isn't the word to use, but a new one ought to be coined then." "What else about Mrs. Vance?" asked Spicy. "Nothing, only she is very charitable, has been round visiting- all the different institutions, and they say she has do- nated something to each. She has an ele- gant carriage and drives in it every day." I was notified, on one of the last days in August, that the house and grounds which I occupied had been sold, and the buyer paid his respects to me in the shape of a request that I should look out for an- other dwelling-place, and give him an op. portunity to move away the old cottage, and erect three handsome white-stone edifices on its site. I at first objected de- cidedly, as I held a lease for months to come, but further interviews and a lib- oral compensation for the trouble at last reconciled me to the measure, but I was confident that I should never get so much attached to any other habitation. It really was a grievous trial to leave it. I regarded all its nooks and corners with daily-increasing affection, as the time drew near when I was to see them no more. Even the ghost-closet, which had been by all abandoned, put out a few ex- piring charms, and Spicy and I went in, and sat down on the steps, and talked over the thrilling incidents of which it had been the scene.     4 "And nobody has ever seen the ghost since that time, a year ago, when Miss Terrapin hung herself to oblige me?"   "No. The blue-room  has hardly been used since. Miss Terrapin camle a number of times in the autumn, on pur- pose, she said, to ransack for a solution of the mystery, but nothing ever came of it I! Our last chance is gone, I suppose, now. If we move next week, the house will be rolled off at once, and, if it holds together to get there, will be rejuve- nated, on a lot in the extreme southern portion of the city." "Next week I Why, Meddile, to-day is Saturday, and you have not found a house, haye you?" "No, but Mr. Burton has volunteered to go to the north side with me on Mon- day, and he thinks I cannot fail to be suited." The bell rang. In an instant, we were running at break-neck speed down the. stairs, for it was Leonardus! Home fora fortnight1 the great surprise of the season I Did not know ho was com- ing until ten minutes before he started  Shouldn't have written  if he had I Wanted to catch us amusing ourselves in his absence I Too bad we had got to move t But lucky he was on hand, for it would be just as well to buy a house now as any time. Would run over and see King, who had several for sale. Guessed there would be time before din- ner. Would get a few permits, so that we could take an early look on Monday'. Wo wore in a whirl of excitement from that moment until we were safely! and comfortably quartered in a home of our own in North Chicago, r-, far from Rush Street, about three-fourths of a mile out. It was a corner two-story frame-house, with a French roof and cu- pola, square, and compact, and extreme-   ly modern. I 'had little or no personal trouble about the transit. "A husband is such a handy thing to have round I "Spicy had said, and that s explains every thing. But it seemed almost cruel to keep him on the jump every moment of llis  stay amiong civilized people! I said so, more than once, and quoted lmy filamous experience in the past, to prove ily abil- ity to lend a helping hand. "You will have enough trouble yet before the war is over. Take it easy while you may," was how he silenced ime. The Dwight mansion was on rollers, and twro-tlirds of the way to the front gate, before weo were out of it. Mr. Burton was anxious to get his houses up before the cold weather set in. A posse of men were laying the sewer, and an- other small army commenced digging the cellars that same morning. The original mneor -of the property came about nine o'clock, with artists and their instru- ments, to get a picture of the departing house. It was such a pity that they did not come sooner, before the foundation had been so uprooted and torn away yI But they must have been people after my own heart, to have made the attempt at all.' I had an affinity for them right aw, and rendered them  all the assist- ance in my power. I even used my Clo- quence to persuade the workmen to ad- journ to' the corner of Madison Street, and we suspended our own  moving-op- erations for an hour. If I could have commanded the winds, I  should have done still greater service, for the swaying of the branches spoiled one effort after another, until finally they were obliged to accept an impression, which fell far 7   short of their ideas and expectations. I stipulated for a copy. Miss Terrapin camle meanwhile and busied herself in scanning the division- line between the blue-room   and the o ghost-closet. As the louso travelled, the closet remained and gaped in aston- ishient  at the wonderful invention which had deprived it of its stairff in old age. "There certainly was never any way of getting  out of that place except through the blue-room, she said, after standing on a table which had been tum- bled out of the kitchen, and stretching her crane-like neck, until Spicy whis- pered to ask 111o if there was any danger of her lielld going up for want of ballast, and leaving her body behind I the children firon  the streets, wl1e lad wNatched my pretty flowers all SUIm- mer, with covetous   eyes through the cracks in the fence, swarmed into the y:rd as the gates no lo(nger sunlh   ()1n their hnges, and strilpped it of its last, beauty.  A  few days aifterward, wlhen I chanced th t iway, there was not a llanld- mark   left. Tlrcp cellars wlero co1- pleted, piles of brick and whto marble covered the remaining lots, wliicl had grown   such rare shrubs and be autifiul trees, and  the hedge and  the currant- bushes and the grape-arbor had disap- peared. Thus passeth away the things of this world! Leonardus found some   frioends going on to New  York about theo time   tlialt Miss Gilbert's scliool opened, and  wo placed Spicy under their charge. It was the same day that Lconardus himself set out to join ]Lis command. My trials always came double.  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7037-00000051"/> "It. is so fortunate for you that they do!"Spicy said. "Here are two now, and you will get over them both at once." Bright felt strange in the neow house, and teased incessantly, to be "tooked 'ome." I filled the nursery with toys, and did my best to make him happy and contented. The nurse was good and kind to him, but she had no tact or in- genuity whereby to devise ways and means to divert and entertain the little fellow. If he cried for the looking-glass, she brought him to me. If he got angry, and struck her over the head, she brought him to me. If he was sick or sleepy, it was all the same, she brought him to me-I must take the brunt. I made it a point to have her keep him in the open air as much as possible. She took him to walk in pleasant weather, and when it rained she drew him in his little car- riage. Coming in, one afternoon, he ran to me, saying: "Me humbug I me humbug I " "Ah I what has reminded you of that? "Me humbug I! me humbugllr I " Who has he seen, since he went out?" I asked of the nurse. "Nobody, maa'm, but a lady in a car- riage." "Did she speak to him?" "Yes 'icn. She stopped by the side- walk, and asked me to hand him to her a moment, and when it looked like rain she said she might as well drive round to where we lived, for we might get caught if we were very long on the way." "And did she take you in also?" "Yes 'cm. I said I could walk, but she told me quite sharp-like, though it   was soft-spoken, that nurses never should let babies out of their sight with stran- gers, so I got in." "How did she-look?" "Like a very nice lady.  I don't think I ever saw a nicer lady." "What did she say to Bright?" "Oh, she held himn on her lap, and asked him to tell her his name, and to kiss her, and some other things. I thinkl she played with him a little, and called him ahumbug. She told me that I must take good care of him." "Is that all? Tell me every word."- "It is all I can think of. Oh, I be- lieve she said Miss Terrapin brought him to see her once, last spring, and that he had grown very much since thlen." ' "Mrs. Vancel  It was Mrs. Vance!" I said to myself. I wished I could see ]her. Perhaps the old mistrust in regard to her identity with Nursy Brown took possession of me for a brief momnent; but, if so, I put it away. It could not bo possible I Lco- nardus had set my mind at rest there, not only a year ago when he first told me Ida Everctt's sad history, but last toeek when Sp)icy and I had mooted the subject again, and tried her case in our self-appointed court. "No woman of Ida Evcrctt's culture was ever equlal to the voluntary with- drawal of herself from every past associa- tion without some compensating adjunct. She has remained concealed most effect- ually from the world, but sheo could no more have existed in such atscrvitude as Nursy Brown walled about her, than my wife here, and what would be her suc- cess, think you, in such an undertak- ing?" were his closing arguments.   They had weight with me for sever- al reasons--principally because men arec supposed to know every thing-and Leo- nardus had seen Mrs. Vance while I had not. Thinking it over and over, and re- volving all the attendent circumstances in my mind until my brain was excited so that I could not sleep through the long hours of the night thiat followed, I determined upon paying a visit to Mrs.. Vance, ostensibly to tliank her for tlihe interest she had manifested in my baby, but really to satisfy an naching curiosity to behold her face, which clamored, re- fusing to boe dismissed. At two o'clock the next afternoon, I found myself sitting in Mrs. Vanco's palr- lor, and the servant llad taken her my card. CIIAPTER   XIII.  MRS. BELMORE VISITS MRS. VAXCE. MY heart beat tumultnously. Every moment seemed an age. I scarcely ob- served the appointments of the room, which were of rare elegance, so intent was I upon the main purpose of my vis- it. I heard a rustle on the stairs I Ahl, coming?--o, it was the servant. She stopped to say that Mrs. Vanco would be down presently.  Waiting, perhaps, to acquire self-control before appearing in my presence. No, no, I do not suspect her of being other than she is. But something was wrong with me, else wily was I there, with my  blood all nagog? My restless eagerness was unlike myself. I had almost reached the limits of my endurance, when I heard her footstep on *l   the stairs, aind in another instant sho was holding one of my lhands between both of hers, and saying, with a warmth of feeling not often mldlo Imanifest by strangers: "I am very, very glad to see you, Mrs. Belmlore." IlHer manner was simplo and direct. She drew a large chair in front of mo, 1andl, before I could speak of lnmy baby, sho introduced the subject: "Miss Terrapin prepared us to be acquainted monllths ago through your darling little boy, and I havo been hop- ing, ever since then, thit this. p'lesulre might bo vouchsafed me." Ier face, whch w\\s entirely colorless, did not strike me at first as wholly pleas- ing in repose, but it was singullrly beaut i- ful when animated in conversation. An inscrutable reticence, which mIlliht balfl the keenest observation when she was silent, disappeared and melted in the glow of pleasure which lit up every fea,- uro while she talked.  Sloe was a wom- an to stir and thrill and entranco the soul, to give stimulus to the intellectual natlrel, to rousO pa'ssionate tenderness in theo heart. Sho chatted free and uncon- strained upon the various topics wlhich were agitating  thlo city and country. Speaking  of the approacling Sanitary Fair, she regretted her inability to take an active part in it, as it was her desire to live as secluded as possible, beut hoped she should bo able to donate her mite for the good of the soldiers. I was intoxi- cated with  lher sweet earnestness, and felt a ncw, strangeo -bond beginning  to tighten around me as natural and inevi- table as any other fact in Nature. Her eyes, of which I had heard so \  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7037-00000052"/> much, were shining upon me with a trans- parent truthfulness in which I felt that I could rest. They were more than beautiful. Were they blue? I suppose so. Grandison Gildersleeve wrote to Helen that they were blue, and Leonar- dus had made the same assertion. But I would not like to have been placed upon the witness-stand and compelled to take my oath on the subject. I onjy saw a lovely woman, a very lovely woman,'of an intense and susceptible nature, look- ing calmly from them through the vista of years which had been crowded with the most painful expericnces. I did not think about their color, I simply basked in their light. H1ad I ever seen them before? I felt like a culprit to have asked myself that question. I had seen some very like theml. None of that fire and life, however-would she pause in her conversation and let me have one more glimpse of her face in repose? No. She was too well-bred to give a guest an opportunity of studying the pattern of her carpet. I tarried longer tlan the circum- stances warranted to -debate that oldA question to myself.-: But I arrived at no distinct conclusion. There was much in the voice and mannerl, .as well as in the outline of fcatures;, that belonged to Nursy Brown. But, during the whole poriodi of- her life under my roof, I had nov6r Iseen the upper part of hier face but once. I remembered my impres- sions at the time, but is it possible to carry such a thing in one's minid and dare to assert an important opinion after so long an interval? How frequent are cases of mistaken identity I A lady- friend of mine once spoke to a gentleman   in the street whom she took for her own brother, and was followed homlle and subjected to an infinite amount of annoy- ance in consequence. Mrs. Vanco be- trayed no consciousness of acting a part, was handsomely though plainly dressed; her coiffure was elaborate, her style un- questionable, and I found myself upon leaving the house disabused of many of the theories with which I had entered it. I urged her to visit me often. Sihe said it would give her great happiness if I would allow her to come without cere- mony, as she was not paying visits, and had declined all the courtesies of'society since she came to Chicago. "How long have you resided here?" 1 had the courage to inquire. "In this house buIt a lew months, in chicago over two years.7" Weo were standing by toe parlor-door, our hands clasped, and lookling directly in each other's faces when she made tlat remark.           f "She is no more Nursy Brown than I   am I "was my final decision, and much that occurred afterward tended to con- firm me in that belief. Miss Terrapin -was delighted when she heard that I had called upon Mrs. Vance. ' "It will be so pleasant for her to have you for a friend!" shhe said.   ! How kindly she always put things  I could imnagine lher making the same re- mark to Mrs. Vance, and with mluch bet- ter grace. It was certainly I whlo would reap the greatest advantage from an inti- mate friendship, if indeed such should be the result. I longed for some one, just such a one, to fill a nicho in my heart, hitherto vacant. For five years   my husband had been Iny all in all, and until the breaking out of the rebellion oiur housoe had been one of the pleasant centres of a charmling social cfrcle, in the atmosphere of which we had expaadeud ,and brightened together. But he was away. My sister was away. I had ecd to recognize the right of society to demand any portion of my time while our husbands and friends were facing the cannon's mouth, and was compara- Atively alone in the din and bustle of a great city. I had needs. A womnan, graceftil, adorned, and tender with wonti- anliness, could supply thelm. I had un- wittingly found her. Mrs. Vance returned my call within the week. It was early one morning, and she proposed( a drive out on the road to Evanston. Bright must go too, and she insisted ulpon holding hinm in her arims. Near the entrance to the old cemetery sheo paused, andl, asling me to excuse her, disappeared in one of tile greenhouses for a few minutes. When I got homeo, a charming b)ouquet of flow- ers on my library-table explained her er- rand. It was about that time that the Sani- tary Fair became, the themle of all tongues, and attracted the attention of the w.1lo0 loyal North. Such a fitrore of lbeonevo- lence had never been known I   Ifen, womon, and children, corporations and business firmns, religious societies and political organizations, all vied withl one another   enthusiastically  as to  who should ( do. the most, for theo 'proceeds were to bo   devoted to -the sick and wounded of the Southwestern hospitals, and what true heart could resist the ap- peal?  The press lent its generous and   persistent aid, the rich' gave of their abundance, and theo poor withhold not from giving becauso of tlioir poverty. The very air seemoed magnotized with grand purposes and contagious gener- osity. The Fair had been projected in the minds of two ladies, whllo lnad on several occasions visited the arnmies at the South, and seen withl their oin eyes whllat an immense amount of supllies were neces- sary to the recovery and comfort of thl b)rave invalids and w-ounded men filling our military hospitals. If, by enlisting tlme Ipople of the Northwest, they could raise ten tlousand dollars, they believed it worthl the efl'olrt, But they little dreameid how greatly it was to outgrow all their original calculationsI it was ]ield on thlo last week in Octc;- ber and theo first week in November, in Bryan Hall, which was transforicmd into a bazaar, rivalling thloso of the Orient in gorglousness and bewildering beanlty. A temporary structure was erected in the rear for the rcccption of the more bulky machinery, farmers' imlllements, etc., which were contributed. the Supervi- sors' Ifnll in the court-house was devoted to art and trophies, and a curiosity-also) it was inded . A large hall in cVick- r's Building was converted into a gal- lery of paintings, and the beautifail and rare works wlhich were collectcd sur- prised those who had not kept pace with the growth of Chicago in uilturle and re- finement. Many of the Chicago artists generously painted pictures for the occa- sion, and afterward donated them, and they were sold for good prices. Metro- politan Hall was devoted exclusively to evening entertainments. Its decorations  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7037-00000053"/> were such that it lighted up brilliantly. Festoons of red, white, and blue, glitter- ing with gold stars, depended from the gallery; every 'ron column was fluted with white and red; while around the gallery were arranged mottoes expres- sive of faith in God, devotion to the country, and undying interest in her brave defenders. The proscenium was arranged with fluted decorations and fes- toons of national colors. At either side of the stage were busts of President Lin- coln and Webster, while over the curtain hovered the national eagle, resting on a shield, grasping the stars and stripes in the talons of one foot, and the arrowy lightnings with the other. And every evening this spacious hall was crowded to its utmost capacity--concerts, ta- bleaux, and lectures, alternating accord- ing to the pleasure of the caterer. The Fair was opened by an inaugural procession which brought all the machin- ery of the great city to a stand-still. The day cannot be forgotten. Such a sight the West never saw before upon any occasion. Chicago was a vast theatre of wonders I From the earliest dtwn of day the streets were thronged with peo- ple. Citizens hurried excitedly to and fro, and country-women with children, country-wagons with flags and banners, horsemen with colors tied to their bri- dles, chariots, civic orders, and military companies, horse and foot, drums beat- ing, bands of 'music playing, and the roar of multitudinous voices in the streets, all combined to render it one of the most magnificent spectacles of the age I The house-tops were filled, and every pathway so jammed with human bodies that it was with great difficulty   that the procession, when formed, could make any headway.  Such enthusiasm as accompanied it has rarely been wit- nessed. The people seemed to overflow with loyalty. Many of them had been silent till now, but their love for the old flag could no longer be hidden under a bushel. There was mighty eloquence in that sublime display. On the court-house steps those who could get near enough listened to several speeches, 'and a salute of thirty-four guns, and then the multitude surged like tidal-waves toward the halls of the Fair. The railroads ran excursion-trains each day, from different parts of the country, which brought crowds of largc- hearted, loyal, whole-souled country- people, and from eight o'clock in the morning until ten at night there was no appVent diminution in the number of visitors during the whole progress of the Fair. Dinners were one of its greatest feat- ures. Lower Bryan Hall was fitted up for that purpose. Dinners had for a long time been a feature of Clhicago fairs. The materials for them were furnished gratuitously by the ladies of the city. Their names were recorded, as, also the articles they would furnish, and thoe days when they would furnish them. Then the aggregate supply for each day could be ascertained. So mSny cooked tur- keys, so many pieces of roast-beef, so many ducks, so many chickens, so many pies, so many puddings, so many gallons of milk, so many pounds of coffee, so many oysters, so many dishes of mashed potatoes, rnd other smloking-hot vEgeta- bles, etc. If the amount pledged was not sufficient, the dinner committee   could supply  deficiencies. By  some mystery of the cuisine, which it is not my province to divulge, from Howa, Wis- consin, and other States, edibles camo in ready for the table as hot as if they had just made their debut from the bake-pan I From one to two thousand gentlemen who usually lunched at a restaurant down-town, dined each day at the Fair, as elegantly and comfortably as if at- their own homes. Six ladies took charlge of each table throulgh the entire two weeks. Two of them were to preside daily, one to pour the tea and confOe, and the other to entertain and supervise. They were the wives of CongressIen, professional men, editors, merchants, Iankers,- and millionunaies-nono  were above serving for the soldiers. Each ladyifurni shed table-linen and silver for her table, and decorated it as her tasto suggested. The table-waiters were the young ladies from  the best families. They were-like the ladies whwo presided -attired in pretty white caps and aprons, trimmed and worn to suit the varied styles of the wearers. It was a novel sceneo -theo matrons beclind their urns receiving all who came to their tables as they wou  lid honor guests in thlleir own homeo-the graceful girls in their pretty uniforms darting hither and tlither-tho continual incoming,.of fresh traysi hnd baskets, and pails, laden with viands- the long line of carvers, one for each va- riety of meats, who had never before donned the white apron and knife of the department--and the crowds who would ' dine in this hall if they had to wait for hours for a place! It was animated, un- isual, picturesque; a department which required grcat executive skill in its man-   agement, and none was nmore popular or successful. I resisted the pressure upon my leart and purse strings until both gavo way, and I was precipitated into this pande- monium of the epicures.  "If I must worlk in tileo Fair, I chooso the dining- haill," I lad incautiously  remlarked to ono of the managers early in the an- trenu, and consequently I was enrolled for 1duty. "I shhall not attend the Fair, but al- low nmo  to firnish the decorations, the silver, the fruit, nnd thllo flowers for your table," said Mrs. VYaco. I accepted her ofrer glaldly, for my stock would 11:mak1e but a poor slow. It wais all tlere, ready for use, on that faimenus Monday morning.  An elegant, solid service, rare and costly-the most elegant and rare and costly that graced the Fair. And such flowers cs   canio fresh overy morningI -the  gems of Chicago greenllouses-and her firuit was tho choicest, and the rarest, and the ripest, that the market afforded. My table thus was the great centre of at- traction. Distinguished parties were all escorted to it, and when the Governor's dinner came off it was the one selected for their special entertainment. I did not see Mrs. Vance during the whole two weeks of the Fair, but I felt her presence continually.  Sometimes Miss Terrapin hovered round with com- missions for her. Mrs'. Vanco has seen by the papers that there ar some very beautifuil speci- mens of gypsum-work from  Grand Rap- ids. Will you tell me where to find them?"  Or: "Mrs. Vanco has heard that from Portland aro some exquisite  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7037-00000054"/> Algae, which she would like to purchase."' Or: "I must hurry, for I have promised to take Mrs. Vance some of the Indian- work from Green Bay-and then I am to go to the court-house to select some minerals." Yolk, the sculptor, was intrusted with the choice of some fine pictures for her, through my recommendation, and she sent money to me in several instances to drop round where there were to be ar- ticles raffled off. She took Bright to drive nearly every pleasant day, and kept my parlors as cheerfully adorned with flowers as my table at Bryan Hall. The great pioneer of all the Sanitary Fairs which honored our country, and encouraged. the worn veterans on the battle-fields, came to an end on Satur- day, November 7th, by the giving of a sumptuous dinner to all the soldiers in Camp Douglas, the Marine Hospital and City Hospital, and the Soldiers' Home; and Anna Dickinson uttered the words of cheer and praise and kindly remem- brance, that dilated the heart and trem- bled on the lip of every woman who had been in attendance  on the Fair. They wero a bronzed, scarred, emaci- ated, halt, blind, dear, crippled, skeleton corps; some without arms, some with- out logs, some swinging themselves pain- fully on crutches, and some leaning on those stronger than themselves for sup- port, all bearing the touching evidence of having suffered for their country. A ' more elegantly-laid table was never seen. The hall had been redecorated, and flags and handkerchiefs waved, and the band 1 -the best band in the city-welcomed them with "Bravo Boys are they." In the preparations, which had sent   the ladies running hither an'f thither for the best their resources afforded, my Lady Bountiful had made me her almoner in the distribution of game, and jellies, and ices, for the whole four hundred. 1 begged of her in a little note, written on a scrap of tissue-paper pressed up against the coffee-urn, to come and see our guests assembled; but she had reasons of her own for declining, and my faith in her ability to judge for herself was sufficient to have silenced any queries which might have arisen in my mind as to the where- fore. The proceeds of the Fair swelled to ove: one hundred   thousand dolllrs I And the world wondered I  So did the business men of chicago, -who had prog- nosticated failure, and laugllhed when the ladies first scattered their circulars and talked of a net profit of ten thousand dollars. TWeary and worn with my arduous labors, I gave myself up to perfect rest for a season.  Miss Terrapin advised me to get lmy winter dresses, for she should be so hurried in December.    But I al- lowed the days to-glide away, one after another, without giving the matter any serious  attention. The quiet of my little home was so enticing, that I had little or no disposition to go out. Be- sides, Rush-Street bridge had fallen one day under the weight of a drove of cattle, and I could not get to Lake Street with- out a  disagreeable long  detotr by the way of Clark-Street bridge. The weather was cold, rendering true, literally true, the lines- "No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease, No comfortable feel, in any member; No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees; No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds, No-vemboer.   I did not need any thing new while I stayed at home, and I never was fond of shopping. Miss Terrapin said I reminded her of the old nman who was found one rainy day curled up in the only dry spot in his house. When asked why ho did not mlent his roof, he said that "it rained so that he couldn't." "But, why don't you mend it when the sun slines?" "Because it don't need mending then." I made the application, but did not supply my dress-maker with work. Time enough, I thought, although my garments of soft wool, so important in such a cli- nate, were far from adequlte to mlly ne- cessities. "It is a good thing to have a journey in prospect once in a while, when one is too lazy to attend to one's wardrobe without a stimulus," I said, ono day, laulghing. "You may lave a sunnnions to go somewhere yet, before the  inter is over," Miss Tcrrapin replied. lPerhaps. But, if I should, thlere is my old black silk alwnys at lhand, like frost on a winter morning." I little dreamed how soon I shoull1 be driven to the black silk, ltholgh ; nor, with what benumbed bitterness I should recall the words so lightly spoken I CHAPTER   XIV. STARTLING   NEWS. "No letter from   my sister Spicy thllis week!"I said to Mrs. Vance, one morning as she sat by nmy library-fire in her velvet mantle, which revealed little D    fine whitc-laco ruffles at the tlroat and wrists. "I hope it don't give you speciail anxiety," she replied. "No, hardly. But Spicy is very pre- ciso in theo fulfilmn nt of her obligations. I fancied sho was not well, by the tenor of her last. Sllo is ambitious, and fully determined to stand hill in her class, and sometimes I fear she studies harder than is good for her. T'lie tone of her letters lhas 'beenI vlery ldiftlronlt this year from whalt they were last." I Was interrupted }by the 1postnman hIimself. But theo letter was not from Spicy I It was post-mnlrked New York, lwo\vever. I broke it open and started with alarm!   Spicy was ill, quite ill; the plhysici n ihad requested them to send for mo.  It mllight not prove serious, but I had better conme immeddiattcly. "Oh, oh! "I exclaimed. "What is the matter?" asked Mrs. Vance. It tl the t letter into her lap, and started to lmy feet, wringing my hands. "Do read it." "Of course you must go," she said, quietly. "Oh, my darling I Why did they not telegraph?" "From   the fact of their writing in- stead of telegraphing, I think you may angur well.  I have no doubt they have sent for you  as clarly as seemed best. Don't allow   yourself to be needlessly agitated.  What can I do for you?" "Nothing, only come and see lBright sometimes.   Or if you will call on your way home, and send Miss Terrapin here, it will save me a journey to Lake Street." "Certainly.  You will take the even-  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7037-00000055"/> ing train, I suppose, and I will send my carriage to transport you to the depot." "Don't give yourself that trouble." "I shall; and more, I shall go with you to the cars. I wish I might make myself useful in some other -way." I looked into her lovely face- "And felt how much suffering with years must have past, To have perfected there so much sweetness at last." There was no idle caprice, no mere en- tanglement of senses between two un- employed natures that was the ground- work of the affection which had sprung up between us, but a subtle harmony, organic, spiritual and intellectual. We were as it were under a spell, and each sympathized in the other's pain. HIcr words, which always seemed to mean more than words, strengthened pme. I had several hours before me, and I looked after my household -and business :affairs with a calmness that surprised even myself, considering how I was racked with anxiety.  t[iss Terrapin came, and promised to spend her nights in my house during my absence. Mrs. Vance's carriage was at my door prompt- ly in time for the tr ain, and she was there herself to cheer and uphold me, and infuse new vigor into my flagging spirits. It was a journey that seemed of in- terminable length. The agonizing sus- pense was more than human nature could bear-so I tlought then; but I have learned since, nnd recently, that its ten- sion is beoyond measurement. I sAnt a telegram from Buffalo, but the train started before the answer came. With sharpened senses from oveorwrought   emotions, I ran my eye up and down the brown-stone front while the carriage was coming to a halt in front of Miss Gil- bert's school, and read-nothing. Inner life in large cities does not hang out its banners. "How is Miss Merriman?"I asked, breathlessly, of the servant who opened the door. "I don't know, ma'am. Walk in the parlor. lWho shall I say has called?" "Let me run up to Miss Merrilman's room." "No, m 'ain. I will call Miss Gil- beyt first. Will you send your name?" I pulled a card from .my porte-monna ie petulantly, gave it to the servant and walked rapidly up and down the parlor, while she stopped and read it on the stairs, turned it over, showed it to Katy -the other chamniber-maid, whom she met in the second hall-and took time to tell her that "she guessed the lady couldn't be any great shakes, coming so early in the morning and being in such a tearing hurry I " Miss Gilbert was engaged for a few minutes, so that, taking it all together, I was tortured into a state of mind border- ing on frenzy. When she came she apol- ogized for the lmessage having been sent to me in the way it was. One of her teachers had written the letter, and hdlad been expressly directed to ask me if it would be convenient for me to come on immediately, but to assure me at the same time that there was no danger. My telegram sent from Buffalo had induced her to make inquiries, and she regretted exceedingly that I had been needlessly alarmed. Spicy was sick, quite sick, with a low fever, caused, she thought,   by some nervous excitement: but she had no apprehensions of any danger. I found her looking very sweet, eyes bright and cheeks pink. She threw both arms about my neck, and held me for a minute when I stooped to kiss her. "How foolish for them to have given you this journey!" she said. "I shall be well in a few days." "You are glad to see nme?" "What a question I Yes, indeed!" "Did you thnk I would come?" "Oh, yes, I knew it. But it was un- necessary. I have good care. The school- nurse is with me nearly every imoment. Miss Gilbert comes very often, and the girls stand readly to do any thing and every thing. I nln notl very sick, as you will soon discover." I was not satisfied in regard to that until I had held a consultation with the old physician. "I am puzzled with her case," ho said. "There seems to be nothing out of'ordoer in her body, and she denies any trouble on her mind. Perhaps you will be able to give me thh diagnosis of her disease, after a few days' comnpanion- ship." She was certainly weak, for she slept all the evening while I sat looking in her face, but took her broth with a great relish at ton o'clock. Slhe left a little in the bottom of the cup, and asked me to save it for her, as she might want it in the middle of the nilght. "Cover it up withl tlis," sle said, producing something from under her pil- low, and I laughed loud enough to have waked the seven sleepers in the next room, as I took in my hand the old like- ness of Fred Gildersleeve.   "What has become of your two-dol- lar mlan?"I asked, after my mirth had subsided. "Don't speak of him I O Moddice!" "Why? What now?" "I am so angry with myself." '"What have you been doing?" "Nothing!- -and that is just what's the matter." ' Do explainl!" "1 don't feel like it; besides, the doc- tor says I must rest quietly at night." "Very well. I amn hero to see that, the doctor's orders areo obeyed, so we will hlave our talk to-morrow." She closed her eyes and lay perfectly still for a few monlents. Suddenly sho became restless, and asked for a drink of water. Tloen slo turned her matted back-hair toward ame, and her fingers were busy picking at the blankets. Something evidently troubled her. lBut what? "AMeddie, aro you going to sit utp all nilight?" tho voice scnmed miles away, and the classic little lead did not turn. "No; I shall lie down after a while. I want to see you asleep first." Silence agatin, and her watch on the table ticked out twenty-five minutes. "Meddie, shall you be going down- street for any thing within a day or two?" "Why, darling?" "I want you to do a faivo for me." "WlVat is it?" "Ploase go to my writing - desk, and inl te  orner, th s cowan ,  you will find sometling folded in a whito paper nmarked 'Sacred.' Thereo --yes, that is it."  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7037-00000056"/> I took it to her. "You keep it, Meddie; I don't want to see it. When you are out, just stop at the missionary-office, and donate it to the heathen." I opened the little parcel and there was a two-dollar bill I "A new method of investment," I remarked, with a smile which sho did not see. "Don't tantalize me. You would not, if you knew all. I suppose I sha'n't have any peace of mind until I tell you. It has got to come, and I may as well re- lieve myself first as last. But I do feel as if I should like to hide under a cab- bage-leaf for the rest of my natural life I Listen, Mceddie I have seen Mr. IIid- dlededahlgreen and talked with hm for several minutes, and had that money in my pocket, and never once thought to offer it to him!" "IHow did it happen?  "We were at the Academy of De- sign, under the charge of Miss Pluss, our drawing.- teacher, who  never knows whether she is in the body or out when she gets in front of a good painting, and that accounts for my having an uninter- rupted tUte-a-te e with a gentleman. I was examining a marble bust which interested no one else, and I was left quite alone, when all at once ho was standing by me, and took my hand just as he did that time in the restaurant, and said he was very glad of the oppor- tunity of saying ' good-by ' to me, for hoe was going to Europe to be gone several years; that he had thought seriously of calling, but was aware of Miss Gilbert's strict rules, and presumed he should not be allowed to see me if he did; asked   me when I was going to graduate, even ; to the date of our commencement-exer- cises, and if I expected to return to Chi- ) cago immediately after, and ever so much more. And all that time he was hold- ) ing my hand, and pretty near squeezing it, to remind mJof my little obligation, no doubt, and it never once came into my stupid head. He's gone, and my last chance is gone of ever paying the -debt, so I want to get rid of the two dollars." I laughed, but yet I caressed and com- forted her, and promised to bury the dreadful bank-note in the Potter's Field of benevolence, and begged her to tlink how much good it was going to do some poor Fecjec, and when she tried to speak I put my hand over her mouth and was rewarded at last by the soft, even breath- ing that was an assurance of welcome sleep. She was better the next day. I took the first opportunity of carrying out her wishes, and sheo thanked me with an earnestness that the occasion hardly war- ranted. Ifer complexion was of that soft, pale tint with a slight undertone of brown in it, which kindles into brilliancy under excitement, and hler soul all seemed on the surface when she exclaimed: "I am so much obliged to you, Mied- die " She improved rapidly, and was soon able to sit up for an houirat a time. The holiday vacation had, commenced, and Miss Gilbert insisted upon our occupying a more cheerful room on the second floor. Spicy was pensive and drooped. I told her stories and read to her, and used every means to give tone and di- rection to her sick mind. Sometimes, even after she was able to walk about   the room, I was haunted with the appre- hension that she was going to die. Her manner toward me was ineffably ten der, almlost pathetic, and I often found her in tears. Yet her appetite had returned, and her genorial health scemed restored. She agreed with us all that I must get to my home in Chicago before New- Year's Day,and was so self-contained at the last, that I was almost piqued to have her show so little feeling. "The idea of travelling at this season of the year in a black silk l" she said. You will certainly freeze without an extra shawl I Do take mine!" " I declined her offer, for I thoulght I should get along very well with my furs and water-proof, as the ears were usually warnm. The first part of imy journey was de- void of incident.  I passed over the Great Western Railway, arriving in De- troit on Thursday morning, the lotlay of 1863. It was snowing slightly as we left the depot, and the storm continued through the day. We were behind time at Matrshall; I think it was three o'clock when we got there, or when we left there, I don't remember which, for my hands were too nunlmb to get at lmy watch, and I depended upon what I heard people saying around me. It was six o'clock when we stopped at Nilcs, and some gentlemen remarked that the storml was increasing in violence andi tle snow in volume very faist.  Some one said it was doubtful whlether we reached Chicago before midnight. I noticed that woe were a long time in starting, as if the engine moved with difficulty. At the next station, and the next, the same trouble was apparent. The wind was   falst becoming a gale. It whistled and shrieked around the windows, and people gathered near the fire in the centre of the car. Wo we'e near New Buffalo, when a shrill whistle signalled, "Down with the brakes!" 11nd the train stopped. Passengers rushhed out, and came back to tell the rest that the ominous and imper- ativc red-light was in the path I Later, they discovered that it was a freight- train blocked in by the snow, and we could neither move backward nor for- ward. A message, was sent on to the next station for the engine, and in the course of two hours we were in motion once more. But our progress was pain- fully slow. I heard the passengers wish- ing each other "a happy New-Year," and soon we were iillmovable and some one announceed thalt engines had been dispatched to Chicago for lielp. Where are we?"I ventured to ask of Imy next neilghbor. ' Close by the crossing of the MAicli- gan Southern Railroad," replied the pro- prietor of one of the finest, longest, silki- cst wht bleards I ever saw, and who sat on the olposito side of tlme aisle. It was getting very cold. I sighed audibly, in remembrance of wasted op- portunities alnd woollen goods. I h1ad not been so thinly clad in wintcr-timno for years. What a godsend that shawl of Spicy's would lhave been I The wood provided for our stovo was wet or green, or botli, and everybody was in a shiver. - The wind howled across the low  Ipr'liri, and penetrated every crack eand crevice, and little snow- drifts piled in about the windows, and swept across our necks and shoulders. The shiver soon became palin in feet and  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7037-00000057"/> arms and hands, and the fuel was fast disappearing. "What shall we do?" more than one voice asked with a shudder. "The fences I "A happy suggestion, and active men secured a saw, took turns in its use, and fed the hungry stove. Soon the flames roared up the pipe, and smoke was discovered about the roof of the car. That would never do I Rather suffer the cold with shelter, than be turned carless into that raging storm on the bleak p)rairie I "Be careful Ibe careful!7' shouted tile conductor. "If one car gets on fire, I cannot save the train i " One car was on fire! And speech- less with terror we watched the hercu- lean efforts of brave men to extinguish it, which they did; bult it was no longer tenable, and its living freight was scat- tered through the other cars. I gave up my seat to a gentleman who was bring- ing a lady in, in his arms, and took one farther forward. The cold grew colder. Thile winds howled louder. The frost pierced to the quick like sharp needles. Those who had lunch-baskets tat -were not emp- ty, distributed their remaining contents among the invalids and children. The gentlemen alternated between the bag- gage-car and the fire, and between the fence and the baggage-car, and the sev- eral fires. What had become of the en- gine sent for aid? Chicago was before our very eyes, and must we perish? The sun was up, shedding no warmth, not even showing his face, or giving us a ray of hope or comfort. An army of fiends must have been let loose in the atmnosphere I It was about noon when a Michigan   Southern train, drawn by three engines, appeared in sight. It was immediately signalled, stopped, and arrangements made for the transfer of the chilled pas- sengers from our train to it. The snow was deep, huge drifts banked in every direction, and we must traverse it a dis- tance of three hundred yards, in the face of a snow-tempest and frost-laden wind, which was sweeping over us like a storm of grape! But we could be taken to the city, if we could immediately reach the Southern train. Not a moment for de- lay, or the engines might frceze immov- able. Cold as it was in our car, tliose who had not had occasion to expose themselves to the storml previously knew little of the ordeal through which they must pass to reach the other train. "'Don't a man of you start without talking a woman or child under your care I " shouted a filll, rich, deep voice; and, turning quickly, I saw the gentle- man for whom I had resigned my seat in the night, swinging his hat with a ges- ture of command. In an instant he had picked up his own charge, thrown the corner of her cloak over her face, and plunged into the fearful storm. Men, women, and( chil- dren followed his example. Strong men fell by the way, frail women -wallowed and struggled, and were dragged to the cars insensible, and children were res- cued half-frozen. I waited a little, part- ly to see how others succeeded, but more from shrinking dread of the perilous um- dertaking; and thhen the other terror, lest I should be left behind and alone, took possession of me and forced me to exertion, I leaped into the snow, and right by my side leaped the man with   the white beard, and tried to help me. He had been buttoning up his coat and tying up Iis ears and face, while I had been summoning my courage. But my blood was the younger of the two. I got in advance of him; the snow blinded me-I tried to go sidewise, and back- ward-I fell down, plunging my arms in- to the snow to my shoulders-rose again -advanced a little-stulmbled-lost lmy muff and my veil-and at last yielded to my fate with one long, hopeless look at the welcome halven so near and yet so far from me. I was half-buried in the snow when I was grasped by strong hands and swiftly borne to the car. I heard the melolious voice, which had rung in Iy enars once before, say to the lady whlo received me from his arnms, and commenced chafglf my face with snow: "Excuse me, that old gentleman has fallen, and I must try and helpl him." Children were crying, womcn were moaning, and men were rushing out for snow with which to extract frost from feet and hands, forgetting their own fro- zen faces until made conscious of it by the painful tingling which follows neglect. White noses, ears, faces, and11 hands, marked nearly every one of the Central passengers, and many of the Southern who had nobly aided in the transfer. The ladies on theo latter train received the helpless and injured, and converted thle cars into a temporary hospital. Mothers were fainting and asking for their chil- dren, and strong men hardly were able to suppress cries of pllysical agony. And the engine shrieked, and then, as if madly, moved on. Hope of early relief inspired us all with fortitude.   Throe miles nmore, and the train sudden- ly stopped. Two Rock Island engines were frozen up on theo track. "Well, Dr. Gildersleeve, what is the prospect?" asked a voice near me, as a rush of cold air and a bang of the calr- door proclaimed that some one was com- ing in. "Tho engineer says thlat sevenlty-fivo engines could not draw ius to town!" was the reply. I could not turn mlly 1hCtd, for mly flaco was packed Iwith snow, and some on10 was clialing my lhands and ar1ms. But lie camne along in front of llo. I know I could not be miistaken. It was the gen- tlenlan to who-llm I o\wed my life. "Ahl, Mrs. Belmore!I I thllouglllt I rec- ognized you, but was not certail," hie said. "I dined at your talle several timles during the Fair." I did remecnlc her I t all camo to mle I I had been attracted b)y his fine flace lnd courtly bearing, and had asked his namle, but none of the ladies knew.  They thought he was an editor, or atf least a man of soeme literary distinction, b1y the deference tfluat was shown him by such gentlemen as Mayor Montrose andn, 'Rev. Dr. Montaguoe, who met lillm thcro. So his name was Gilder sleeve!-not Fred-too - many  years and  too much dignity resting on his shoulders. But Ida Everctt's quondam lover, perchance I And   a noble specilmen of God's handi- work  lo was indeed I The very car seemed full of him, hlo cnmalated so much hope and cheer and good-nature. 'We   must shake our lunch-baskets once more, and make the best of our scanty bill-of-fare," he said, in reply to the pitiful query of a feeble old woman,  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7037-00000058"/> as to whether we should be able to get any thing to eat before morning. A sharp pain in my stomadh remind- ed me that I had not tasted a morserIfor more than twenty-four hours. MRust we die of starvation and cold, in full view of the turrets and spires of luxurious Chi- cago I Was there no one among us who could face the storm and bring aid? I saw the question answered a few moments later. More than ten stalwart men, wrapped to their eyes, undertook to reach a house that secmed not over three-fourths of a mile distant, and each turned back to save himself. It could not be done I Children screamed with pain and hunger. Women were exhausted with fasting, fright, and frost. Men were dis- cussing the probable failure of fuel, and the cautious-of both sexes were constant- ly warning the fire-tenders with pictures of burning-cars and quick destruction. "Thereo is wood and coal on yon- der Rock Island engines. We must got it or-freeze," said Dr. Gildersleeve, and gentlemen unused to exposure, who had never handled an axe, or carried a bur- den, followed him into the storm and worked like heroes. But they could not exercise in the terribly exhaustive wind but a few minutes at a time, and volun- teers were roenlisted again and again, before the needed supply for the night was secured. le' was slaking the snow from his hair, and pressing his hands to his whit- ened ears, when the friend who had ad- dressed him before asked for his wife. "She is comfortable-more so than most of-the ladies. We were better pro- vided for cold than travellers usually are.   as our experience last year in getting snowed in on a Western train was a se- vere stricture on improvidence." I roused myself enough to make kind- ly inquiries, and learned that his wife was a confirmed invalid. He was just bringing her home from an Eastern cure, where she had been for several months. And, although I did not see her, I learned that she was warmly tucked in an im- provised bed in the next car, and that her name was-HELEN! CHAPTER XV. THE RESCUE. MEANWHLE the conductor of the train and two loyal friends had breasted the tempest, determined to save the pas- sengers or die in the attempt. It was not quite dark when they reached the Tremont, so frozen that they could scarcely be recognized by their nearest kin. The news which they communi- cated flew like wildfire from one hotel to another. The cooked meats that were being carved for their dinners were has- tily packed, as also chickens and game, and sandwiched tongue, and turkey, and jellies, and wines; and four large sleighs were filled and manned; but one only of the three who had brought the sad in- telligence of perishing humanity, was able to return as a guide to the ill-fated train. The other two were crippled for years. And but one only of thefour sleighs reached its destination. The drivers of the others lost their way, were blind- ed by the storm, and finally returned   whence they came with frozen feet and hands and faces. What a thrilling announcement I The door of our car opened, and a muffled figure as white as the storm he socmed to represent, entered and hoarnsely shouted: "Provisions for the multitude A sleighful from the cityl " Surprise, gratitude, and admiration, echoed from 'the heart of every one who had realized our danger. We ate, and wondered, and silently thanked the men who had dared so much for our salva- tion. Fires were lighted at the rear of the cars as a beacon to the other sleighs, but they came not. How any human being could have lived to ride in the face of such a storm was a matter of astonish- ment to all. The sleigh which had arrived, out of mrcy to the horses, set out for Chicago as quickly as unladen, and one or two ladies, who would not be persuaded to the contrary, went in it. But we learned afterward t!at they were badly frozen before reaching a place of shelter. The night wore away. Thlcre were but few eyes closed in sleep. The fires were carefully fed and watched. The winds subsided toward morning, and the fill moon peered in upon us to say: "The storm is spent, and how have you borne its wrath?" There was joy among us, when, about eight o'clock, an engine was seen ap- proaching from the east witl a snow- plough.  Before ten o'clock it had reached us and drawn us back to the junction, where two or three other trains were in waiting. It was some- what after noon when sleighs arrived, 8   chartered by the railrolad complany, to convey such passengers as did not choose to wait for the road to lb broken to Ulrich's Hotel. It was a tedious, cold ride, but we were s'afely set down there, and partook of an excellent imeal, for which the warm-hearted proprietor re- fused to accept any reconmpense. Dr. Gildersloevo was one of several who stayed by the train. "My wife will suffer more by the ex- posure of a sleigh-ride thianl by rreflain- ing quietly where she is," he said, as he pinned a heavy blanket around me, which had been sent in one of the sleighs. And he was indefatigable in "s efforts to make every one comfort- able-running froml sleigh to sleigh, warming boards for the feet, and bits of wood for the hands, tucking in robes, and pinning down veils-and then tile bells jingled and we saw his pleasant face no more.  I tried to recall what I lad heart d hm say about the number of his residence, but could not. It was not fair, how- ever, from my own lhome.  I thought of it many times, while I lay sick and suffering from the effects of my ter- rible experiences, for I did not leave my bed again before the following Mafrch. I had taken a cold, which alarmed both friends and physicians, My voice was entirely gone for three weeks, and med- ical inhalatious were the last resort. I saw no one but Mrs. Vance. She was my daily attendant, and to her judicious ministrations I owed miiy final restora- tion to health. I never mentioned Dr. Gildersleeve's name to her. What right had I to know the secrets of their youth? And she had  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7037-00000059"/> never, by word or look, given me the fragment of a license to touch upon her past life. There was the one barrier between us that I dared not pass. He called twice to inquire after me during my illness. She was sitting by my bed one day when his card was brought in, and his courteous message delivered. But her features did not change, and she dropped me some medicine the next mo- ment without a perceptible quiver of a muscle. Spicy's letters were-read to me each week, and it was interesting to note her transformation into the character of counsellor and comforter, as soon as she heard of my illness. I should have been blind indeed not to have seen her steady, constant growth. She was beyond me already in many things. With all her childish ways and native simplicity, the angles of her character were getting pretty well rounded. Miss Gilbert wrote me one or two very encouraging letters in regard to her progress, but my love was far-seeing and could detect unnum- bered evidences which the skill of ex- perts might fail to discover. Wherefore all this outcry about the inferiority of the provisions for female education, in comparison with those for men?  The public-school systems of every State in the Union unquestionably advance both sexes alike. And where are any better institutions for young women than Miss Lyon's, Miss Gilbert's, and a score of other schools which I might name, where our daughters and sisters are instructed in every branch of knowl- edge, and every fine art for which they have any aptitude, besides partaking of the benefits which are to be derived   from the society of the best teachers money can procure? They live among tasteful appointments, they feast upon wholesome food, as well as concerts, lectures, and social reunions, and every refining influence which Christian love and thoughtful care can suggest is brought to bear upon them. There are thousands of women who have never improved under their advantages, as there always have been and will be thou- sands of men who believe in cheap, rough schools for their boys, forgetting how much culture can serve them here- after. As soon as I was able to ride, Mrs. Vance was untiring in her endeavors to give me all the fresh air I could breathe. Sometimes she accompanied me, but of- tener her carriage came entirely at my disposal. Her venerable aunt Mary was quite ill, and she was divided in her cares. But I was gaining strength every day, and needed her less. Leonardus was looking for'w-ard to the termination of the war in a few months, and was giving me a new lease of life in each let- ter, in the shape of his probable and per- manent return. He never knew all I had suffered. June came, with its roses and sun- shine, and I was once more on my way to New York. It was one of Dr. Wild, er's prescriptions, and then I could not well forego the pleasure of attending Miss Gilbert's commencement. I stayed at the hotel in company with my friends from Phhadelphia, wlo met me there, for a few days previous to the examinations, knowing how much better off Spicy would be without my sisterly interruption at such a time. My health   was improving rapidly. New-York air was just the thing for me. Spicy de- clared it as her belief that "New-York stores, and plenty of money, was a much more effectual remedy for diseases in general.' How splendidly sle acquitted herself when the great day at last arrived I She took a prize in scholarship. I knew she would; and I was elated, or inflated, until I feared my new patent button- holes on my dress might give way. They were made by machine, and I never had any faith in the invention. The "essays" were to be read in the evening at the grand reception, and tile diplomas awarded afterward. The young ladies of the graduating class were seated in a circle in the centre of the parlors, and looked like so many rare and beautiful flowers. Just as I entered, a tall, high-fore- headed, black-bearded young professor -not of elocution-commenced reading the sprightly, analytical, satirical articles which the young ladies had been study- ing upon half the year, in a most intoler- ably humdrum and prosy manner. I was in an agony, and bogged of one of the teachers near me to tell me why each young lady did not read her own. "Miss Gilbert thinks it would not be proper. It would give the young ladies too much publicity." "Publicity, indleed I How much more publicity, I pray, than to produce the happy effusions which are being so ruth- lessly murdered!," "Young ladies never read their own compositions in fashionable schools, Mrs.  Belmore!" "Fools, then, are in fashion "    She stared at me, and I apologized immediately. "Of course you are not responsible for the regulation, but it is one of the most painful entertainments it was ever my lot to witness. Here we are, not five feet from the assassin, and cannot fasten the sense of any two passages together  lie rattles it off as one would shell corn I If a man must be selected to torture every guest assembled, why not have found one with soul enough to appre- ciate the misery he was giving I My poor, dear Spicy Her valedictory ad- dress, so full of good points, and which would be so touching and'effective in her own hands, must it meet the smne fate? Yes, there it comes Hhow aggra- vating, how absurd I The dolt He does not know an interrogation-point from a pair of bars 1-nor a dash from a high board-fence  I hear him bidding his classmates farewelll They raise curi- ous mustaches in this young ladies' school if his is a sample I Now he has raised the mill-gate, and is inundating the teachers I Ah, the model school has not yet been achieved " I came to silence thlrough mly desire to listen to the few remarks which ac- companied the presentation of the di- plomas. The young ladies all stood. I wondered why they did not have veils thrown over them to prevent their being seen Too much publicity, indeed I Why this crowd? If it is to become a source of harm instead of good, dispense with guests 1 But they are the friends of the young ladies, and are interested in their successes, you say? Precisely so. That was my first supposition. Hence my dismay when I found they were only to  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7037-00000060"/> be heard through a male translator, and one who did not know the elements of his own language I I had hardly been so out of humor since my own school-days. My brow was clouded, and when Spicy came to greet me I forgot to commend. She was happy and unconscious, however, for did she not hold in her hand the scroll tied with blue ribbon? "Now, Meddie, I must introduce you to all my friends," she said, with great animation. The nearest one was Miss Hale. Miss Hale was bright and sparkling, wore a garnet-dress and diamonds, and talked bad English. I discussed the weather and the numbers present with her, and was relieved by an introduction to Miss Twissapple. Miss Twissapple was a Bos- tonian, had been at Miss Gilbert's one year, and was homesick; indeed, she said she did not think it right for any one to come from Boston to New York without being homesick I And then her lovely home was such a contrast to a boarding-schoolI Suddenly I was car- ried away to Miss Proudhead. Miss Proudhead was gotten up in tarlatan, with a great quantity of sash-ribbon and extra flutings. She was in love with New York-that old miracle, love at first sight. She wanted to stay hero always. She introduced me to Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson was a theological student, very fresh, from some Western college, and very much distressed with the vanities of this world. He wanted to know if I had seen his friend, Dr. Steelpen. I had not. He was surprised, said he was the editor of the Roaring Lion, one of the leading evening papers, thought every- \   body knew him, and went at once and found him, and brought him to ine with a great profusion of bows. Dr. Steelpen looked like the other young men present, whom I supposed were only private citi- zens, wore cuir-colored gloves and a green necktie; asked me if I was any con- necton of General Belmore of the army;. wa  very deferential the moment he learned that I was that gentleman's wife. Had a daughter in the school? No, that could not be possible Some relative? A sister - how very pleasant  H1er name? Oh, yes ;, he had seen Miss Mer- riman. A few more questions were very adroitly put, and then Spicy broke up the little tete-d-tete by presenting Miss Rubicond, her pretty class-mate. Miss Rubicond took my heart at once. Her face was beaming with life and intelli- gence, and I forgot to notice what she wore. There is such a difference in faces. My eyes followed Spicy, as she moved airily and gracefully about among the guests, with fond admiration. She had grown very beautiful within the last year, and she was transcendently cl arlm- ing on this occasion. I did not so much blame Dr. Steelpen for causing an elab- orately-written article to appear in the next issue of the Roaring Lion, calling her the belle of the evening; but I was indignant with Miss Gilbert for allowing a newspaper editor at her receptions, and tolerating the senseless gossip in the pub- lic prints as to how each young lady was dressed Too much publicity for one of thoem to road her own essay, but quite the fashion to read the next day, as I did: "Miss Spicy Merriman, of Chicago,   a sister-in-law of General Belmore, was the most bewildering beauty present, and the most elegantly dressed in point-lace over white satin," etc. The dear child never thought of wear- ing any thing more expensive than tarla- tan, and she never had a scrap of point- lace in her life I Dr. Steelpen said noth- ing, either, of its having been a school- reception I I cried with vexation, when I saw the ill-bred paragraph. But I anticipate. Miss Rubicond was giving me a lively description of how she had had her pocket picked the day be- fore, when I saw Spicy's face blanch, then light up with a thousand pretty scintillations, as she advanced to greet a gentleman who was pushing toward her through the crowd. I could not see his face distinctly without being rude to Miss Rubicond; but, after a while, I wondered who had secured my sister's attention for so long, when it was a rule of the estab- lishment that no young lady should talk more than ten successive minutes with one guest! I turned, finally, to look, and at the same instant Spicy moved toward me, and introduced her coni- panion: "I beg pardon," she said, addressing him as the ceremony was about half completed; " but I never could pro- nounce your name " "Gildersleeve," he replied, bowing. "Mrs. Belmore, Mr. Gildersleeve," Spicy went on with the utmost gravity; but, dropping her hand on my arm in a perfectly natural manner, she pinched me until I started with pain. I found him handsome and agreeable. He may have bcen a trifle eccentric, for he coined new and odd words regardless   of the rules of etymology; butho was the more interesting for being original, and "was a gentleman of infinite jest and most excellent fancy." Ho had boon abroad, had spanned the Mediterranean, had visited the land of the Pharaohs, and the temples of the East; had seen much, and forgotten nothing. "Have you a brother in Chicago?" I asked, after a little. "Yes, the Rev. Dr Gilderslecve. , I am going to see him in a few days. He thinks to persuade me to cast my burden in the West." "He has not always resided there?" "Oh, no. Hoe worked at the trade of saving souls in the little town of Pect- liarville, on the Hudson, for a few years. He first went to Chicago in 1860. He is one of your muscular Christians, broad- shouldered and strong-armed, and wages remorseless war upon the inactivity of the multitude. He is striving now for a revolution in journalism, and performs so much labor daily, with constantly-in- creasing physical and intellectual vigor, that he is supposed to have been the original promulgator of the doctrino that deterioration of bodily or mental powers under sixty is an unnatural de- cline." Before I could reply, Miss Gilbert had ushered into my presence a stiff-necked gentlemen with a bald head, and some one had spirited away Mr. Gildersleeve. Shortly after, a few sets had been formed for dancing in the crowded par- lors, and I saw him taking his place with Spicy. I could observe him better at a distance, and admitted to mysdlf that I had never seen a more elegant figure or a finer bearing. Spicy's face was like a  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7037-00000061"/> mine of brilliants, and when he paused every now and then to drink in the in- cense of her first girlish beauty, a pang of jealousy seized me and my spirit was all in arms against him. If I had known, what I afterward knew, how skilfully his well-timed arrival had been planned, and with what persistence he had se- cured his introduction to Miss Gilbert in order to be invited to her reception, I should hardly have shaken hands with him as courteously as I did when he "made his adieux, or have extended the invitation, which fell naturally from my lips, for him to call upon us in Chicago. Would you ever have believed that old picture which I have housed so long was taken for him?" said Spicy, as she stood with her arms round me in the dressing-room. I shall hide it now, for I feel as if I had been guilty of pro- fanity."  What could I say to her? Had her heart read its destiny? I don't know why I should have arrived at any such foregone conclusion. But I had been driven there by inexorable intuitions. I asked myself many questions; and prin- cipally, were Spicy's eyes becoming open to that highest, holiest attribute of our nature, love? had she tasted the first sweet consciousness of its existence, felt the first flutterings bf its silken wings, and heard the first rising sound of that wind which sweeps over us all to purify or to destroy  My thoughts were like a cloud-land- scape, which may be comprehended but not explained. And ,why need we al- ways explain? Some feelings are so un- translatable that no language has yet been found for them. They gleam upon   us through the twilight of fancy, and yet when we bring them close, and hold them up to the light of reason, they lose their importance all at once-like glow- worms which gleam with such a spiritual light in the evening, but, when subjected to the inevitable gas, prove to be only worms like so many others. During our short visit to the sea- shore, and a few days in Boston and Albany, and a rather eventful and long- drawn-out journey homeward, neither Spicy nor myself once mentioned Mr. Gildersleeve's name. Spicy grew more lovely each day. Happiness shone from every lineament of her face, and admiring eyes followed her every movement. Her exhaustless fund of gayety and vivacity won all hearts, and rendered her a most agree- able companion. I shall always want to remember her as she was then; the most gentle and true, the most gifted and modest, the most piquant and pleasing of only sisters. Fatherless and motherless and broterless, we clung to each other, the two representatives of a large family who had long since gone to that home from which there is no return. Clung to each other did I say? That is, I clung to Spicy, as a mother clings to her child, and had been fondly looking forward to this era in her history, when we two could sit down and enjoy. And Spicy had always regarded me as her dearest and best friend. What did I fear? Why guard her with such green-eyed tenacity  I had refitted and refurnished a room for her, which she declared was a perfect gem. Her own things were soon ar- ranged in it, and a few brackets and or- naments and pictures added afterward,   gave life and effect to what I had previ- ously placed at her disposal. But the old daguerreotype was seen no more, nor did I ever again hear any humorous allusions to it. About three weeks after we returned, a neatly-executed card was sent up one evening "to the ladies." Spicy handed it to me, and I read "F. R. Gildersleeve." The exquisite blush which mantled Spi- cy's cheeks confirmed all my former the- ories. Oh how should I snatch my jewel from its setting? Bright was fretful that evening. He had cut his finger with a string and would insist upon my nursing and ca- ressing it. I tried my best to quiet and leave him, but he was obstinate and de- tained me a prisoner in my room. Spicy came in radiant about ten o'clock. She said Mr. Gildersleeve re- gretted very much not having seen ine, but would call the next day at three in the afternoon to pay his respects to me, if I would be so kind as to admit him. "Serene, full-orbed, divinely-imper- tinent chief of scoundrels!". I exclaimed, with fire flashing from every pore. "In- deed, I will not have any such kindness  It would be superhuman power of act- ing, and I am no hypocrite, whatever my faults " "What do/ you mean?" asked Spicy, with a look of unspeakable sadness, a sadness which was a sadness dear to the soul, and a great deal of down there in her voice.            i "That I decline any further conver- sation on the subject." *   CHAPTER XVI. MRS. BELMORE AND FRED GILDERSLEEVE. MY resolution  was taken. I had changed my mind since I dealt the cruel blow which had sent Spicy to her room like a wounded bird. Yes, I would see Mr. Gildersleovo when he should call, but I would not let this thing go on. No possible pain to Spicy weighed for a moment in tie balance against my im- pulse to part them. It was shoor selfish- ness, but it was human. I might have remembered  the lines which  I once heard Nursy Brown singing to Bright: "Nature's laws must be obeyed; And this is on%;nost strictly laid On every soul which she has made, Down from our earliest mother: Bo self yopr first and greatest care, From all roproanch the darling spare, And every Llamo which she should bear Put off upon another. "Had Nature taken a second thought A better precept she had taught, And good instead of evil wrought By those the power possessing- "For self had boon put out of sight, The love of others brought to light- In short, the wrong had all been right And man to man a blessing." I heard the bell echo through the house, and in a few minutes my expected visitor was announced.  I descecded to the parlor armed to the teeth with the weapons of my disordered inclinations. I had not mistaken his errand. He was there to ask permission to pay his ad- dresses to my sister. It was very gentle- manly done. But cost what it might I was bound to refuse his request. And I did. IIo did not ask me to give any rea- sons. He did not seem to presume that I had any worth giving. He evidently regarded me as capricious and unstable.  &#xD;<pb n="120 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7037-00000062"/> I was nettled by his aggravating cool- ness. At last he said, and I had that same painfum consciousness of being talked down to, that had first come over me in connection with Spicy's aggrieved face the night before: "I have not spoken to Miss Merriman on this subject,/preferring most decidedly your approval before doing so, but in my opinion we are both too deeply in love for any particular good to come from interposition. It has been brought about by one of those inexplicable agen- cies for which we do not pretend to hold ourselves responsible. In my case, for instance, I have wandered through a pretty fair number of years, have paid my dividend of homage to the goddesses of beauty in one place and another, with- out ever having had my heart seriously touched until chance threw me in the way of your irresistible sister. Since then, I have very naturally decided that the heart cannot remain empty health- fillly, neither must it feed upon itself. I esteemed it less than manly to reveal my love and try to win that of an unfledged birdling, so I tore myself away and went to Europe. The merest accident on the day before my departure threw us to- gether for a brief moment, and without the knowledge of it on her part, or any intention of drawing it from her on mine, the certainty that she loved me became my secret, and has since given me the most ecstatic delight." He took out his watch mechanically and glanced at the time, then rose, like one perfectly conscious of his advantages, personal and intellectual, and filled with a noble charity for whlat in his lordly way he no doubt esteemed my unavoid- I   able acquiescence at some future period, and bade me good-afternoon. I remained sitting like one in a dream. Spicy came in and sat down at the piano, but she only tumbled over her music, she did not strike a chord. I could not speak. I could not even look at her. Two scalding tears were forcing their way down my cheeks, and I covered my face. It was with an effort that I could dis- charge Imy home and social duties re- spectably for the next two weeks. Spicy drifted about as blithe as ever, except that her sallies of humor were less frequent, and her cheeks were a trifle blanched. She had asked no question relative to my interview with her lover, a circumstance in itself perplexing, but in keeping with her singularly unread- able character. She had always been the surprise as well as the life of my lifb. If I had seen the pencilling on a card which was attached to an exquisite little locket containing a miniature, and worn next her heart, the veil which so ob- scured my vision would liave been rent indeed. I was so unhappy that I applied to Mrs. Vance for counsel. I did not, however, reveal to her the gentleman's name, although she must have learned it shortly afterward. "And you think they thoroughly suit each other?" she asked,k after listening to my self-reproaches. '; It so appears from my point of ob- servation." "And you have no objection to the lover himself, his family, or his for- tunes?  "None whatever, as far as I am aware."  &#xD;<pb n="-121" xml:id="VAC7037-00000063"/> "Then you ought to remember that right is right, just as wrong is wrong, and that true love is too rare a plant to be lightly crushed. Where would you have been but for its haven?" I trembled, and the vague apprehen- sion, bitterer by far than the torments of jealousy or the humiliation of wound- ed self-love, stood out in my mind like a veritable accuser, of my having sat in judglment and failed in justice. "Wlly does not Spicy complain, or Ilead witl me, and give me a chnce to retract my folly?"I asked. "Silmply because it is unlike her to do any such tiing," replied Mrs. Vance. "But why does not the devoted lov- er appelar once more and sue on bended knee for her hand? That is the way -these dilficulties are overleaped in books." "I dare say ho is not tlat type of a man." "What slnall I do?" Mrs. Vanco smiled at the despairing tone of my question.  "If you hlave made up your mind that you cannot, will not, stund in the way of your sis- ter's happiness, you have only to com- municate that same fact to the gentleman in question, as I understand the case." Thus I reasoned, myself, after ller words reached my ears, and I welcomed the relief which my decision brought to both mind and body. But I did not know wlhere to find Mr. Gildersleeve. I made sundry and divers private inves- tigations all in vain. As tloe last resort I resolved to call. on thll Rev. Dr. Gilder- sleeve and his wife. The matter of call- ing on them had been on my mind ever since my recovery in the sWing. It had   seemed rather an obligation than other- wise, after all that had occurred on that frozen railroad-train, and his courtesy afterward. I knew where they lived. It was in a pretentious-looking house, not five blocks away, and in a fashion- able quarter of the city. I had noted it wlhen I passed that way. A visit now would probably lead nme into the knowl- edge of the whereabouts of the brother, and without any direct questionings either. I dressed with more tlan my usual care one afternoon. Spicy commented upon the fact, and asked me if I was go- ing to make calls. I replied in the neg- ative, pinning my veracity to the singular numlber, and felt very luch chagrined that I should be obliged to steal away liko one setting out on a questionablo expedition. Then she proposed taking 'a walk witl me, and I declined her com- pany, quite an unusual circumnstanco for one who was in the halit of publishing every why and wherefore of her imove- ments to all concerned. I asked Spicy to remain at homo and receive Mrs. Vance, who was comiing to drive us out to Lake View. She looked surprised, but I hurried away before some new emnbar- rassmcnt should intervene. I rang teio bell at Dr. Gilersleeve's door, and tho servant appeared. It was a colored girl. "'Massa not in and Missus no see company." I had nothing to do but leave my card and return home. We had not had rain for some time, and the streets on the north side, where there were no pave- ments, were filled with deep sand. In crossing one I sprang to get out of the way of a carriage, stopped on my dress,  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7037-00000064"/> and was pitched into the dust. I was not hurt, but inclined to glance my eye up and down the side-walk to see if I had been seenl and behold! a gentleman was running toward me. I turned my face the other way, and commenced shak- ing the dirt from my bottle-green silk, but in an instant he had stooped grace- fully by my side, restored my card-case, and begged to hope that I had not in- jured myself. It was Fred Gildersleove. The next moment Mrs. Vance's car- riage had halted, and, with a musical laugh, she asked me to ride, since I could not be trusted to walk. Mr. Gildersleeve handed me in, and I had the remarkable presence of mind to thank him, although I was too much disturbed and shaken up to be able to add what else was. on my lips, and the opportunity was lost. Spicy declined driving with us that afternoon. The horses ivere in fine con- dition, and we were back in time to drive to Lake Street to do some shopping. Mrs. Vanco tried to persuade me to dine with her, and, not succeeding, bade me adieu at her own door, and sent the car- riage home with me. The new Rush-Street bridge had swung just before we arrived, and we were consequently foremost in the long line of vehicles which were waiting to cross. A tug tugging at two large ves- sels came screeching and yelling along toward the lake, and the horses stood on their hind-feet in an attitude of mortal terror. One leap forward and we should be plunged into the dark, dirty pool known as Chicago River. One leap to the right, and we should be entangled in a butcher's cart. One leap to the left, and a heterogeneous mass of human be-   ings huddled together, ready to spring upon the bridge, would be crushed. Every looker-on saw our imminent peril, and the imperative need of some strong hand to seize the heads of the frightened animals if a catastrophe would be pre- vented. Only one, however, in all that crowd, had the quickness and the cour- age to dart to the rescue. It was Fred Gildersleeve. He held them firmly, and infused so much power and protection into his voice, that the excited creatuf'es were subdued, and, quivering and snort- ing and pawing the earth, made no at- tempt to break away from him. As the bridge closed he stepped one side to re- lieve their curbed impatience, and I, beck- oning him to me, invited him to step into the carriage, and drive home and dine with us. "It would give me great pleasure, Mrs. Belmore, but I am afraid of your horses," he replied, with a smile that had just enough of sarcasm in it to sting. I felt that I was having as hard a time to undo what I had done, as Spicy did in trying to pay her two-dollar debt. The next evening, however, the bell rang, and Mr. Gildersleeve's card was brought to me. I went to the parlor directly and met him with undisguised cordiality. "And so I take it that you regard me no longer as a monster or a robber. But I do not accept this token of your favor as a reward for my services," lie said, with that same high-up bearing which had so nearly annihilated mie on a former occasion. "I love your sister, and, since your manner has indicated the kind permission, I have called to see her."   I entered into a somewhat ambiguous explanation, and concluded by sending Spicy to the parlor, and then, under the dim gas-light in my own room, rocked Bright in imy arms, and cried until my eyes were inflamed for a week. "My pet will owe her happiness to me," was my only solace, and I repeated the paragraph over and over again, in the same way as whenh a child I once de- clared, "I'm not afraid of the dark! I am not afraid of the dark  I'm not afraid of the dark " running meanwhile as fast as my feet could carry me toward a lighted room. When I next saw Spicy, her face wore that radiance which told me that her heart was at peace. Their engagement was speedily announced, and her wed- ding-day fixed for the first of February. Mr. Gildersleeve had greatly desired to be married during the holidays, but I would not consent.  Spicy should be mine until the return of Leonardus. Miss Terrapin was in her element. It was vastly more interesting to make wedding-g'arments than any other. It was Miss Terrapin's special forte.' She thought Spicy mlight as well give up the whole care of it to her. But Spicy, had ideas of her own about how she should dress as a bride. I was diverted by tleir frequent collisions, and not unfrequently called in as an umpire. Miss Terrapin said, it had become a chronic'necessity in these days for wom- en to dress elegantly, yes, even extrava- gantly, in order to command their hus- band's little attentions, which were so apt to be bestowed elsewhere than at home. Marriage was in her opinion the grave of love. At all events it was a se-   vero test, for it brought intimate associa- tions to bear upon unequal and ill-assort- ed dispositions, habits, tastes, tempera- meuts, and capacities. And when, by reason of tender ago (Spicy ought to have waited until she was twenty-five), inexperience, or the force of circum- stances, such grave considerations were overlooked, then, of course, unhappiness and every other conceivable misfortune would surely rush in. She told my dainlty little morsel that her own character was continually developing, while that of her husband mlight be said to have attained its growth. "Then you would recommend that the deficiency be filled with dry-goods, if I understand you rightly?" modestly inquired Spicy. "No, no; yes-well, that is, if young people have indulged fancies when their affections were immature and their tastes undeveloped, and they have becomII en- tangled for lifo with wants unsatisfied and feelings unsympathized with, they should make it a matter of principle to increase their persolnal charms in every possible manner. The country is fdll of ricl people, the stores are laden with beautiful and expensive goods, tlero is a great deal of competition among ladies in regard to the quality and style of their apparel, and a young wife with tho means at her command should unques- tionably take the front rank if she wishes to retain the love which she fondly sup- poses her own." "OOn the contrary, Miss Terrapin, I am full in the faith that there is no vir- tue, nor one amiable characteristic of our sex, that would not be relieved of a bane and nursed into healthier life, if this non-  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7037-00000065"/> sense about imperative fashion and cost- ly dress were abandoned.  Too much thouglut altogether is given to the sub- ject. I believe in suitable attire. I like an exhibition of good taste at all times and places. If one hasn't any taste of her own, I say, employ Miss Ter- rapin. But I sha'n't buy as many silk dresses as there are cl'rs in the rainbow for the sake of having a variety, nor have what I do see fit to buy furbelowed to my eyes. Neither shall I spend a whole year's income on the trimmings to my underwear. I had rather do as Mrs. Vance does, give my money to the poor, and I believe Fred would agree with me, if hle was to be consulted." "Ah, Miss Spicy, that is how women deceive themselves. Men never show what they really are until they have se- cured the prize. To-morrow there is a wedding, and then comes another to- morrow when there is despair and hu- miliation of sp)ilrit.' "Pleasant prospect! Miss Terrapin, , you are an inveterate cronker. There, thlat shall be  your name  hereafter. Croaker! how  do- you like it? Now, Croalker, let me tell you a short story. It is as true as tloe book of Acts. Fred never fell in love with my rig. He first met me in a ball-room   where I was dressed the plainest of any one present, and, lie says, hoe asked to be introduced to me because lie couldn't help it. Ev- ery timel he saw noe afterward was when I was in my very worst look, and yet he waent on loving me like the apple of his eye. There is no mistake about it. Ioe has proved it, hasn't he, Meddie? And he is going to live on proving it. You cannot stir in me the ghost of a doubt."   "Oh, yes. Admitted that he adores you-at present " (Spicy laughed with the old, silvery cadence), " but I have never heard any account of your intense recip- rocation." "Really, Croaker, that is too bad I I ought to have worn my heart on the outside as one wears a neck-ribbon, so that every one I nmet could have told the color!" And Spicy's little ireful retort took effect. "Meddie, what did you think when you found me sick in New York and nothing ailing me?   Love! what is it? If to go through every pliase of heart-anguish until it becomes a positive luxury is love, then I was in it for certain, althoughl I did not know, my- self, what was the matter at the time. I thought my life had all gone abroad never to return. When tinie tried the keenness of my despair I took alarm, re- fused to be so comforted, and marshalled all the sources of my distress anew. I should have defied the old tyrant with silent latnentations too grievous to be borne until the lresent 'day, if Fred had not returned. Come, Croaker, you understand all about it, wasn't that gen- uine love?" L"I dare say. But I never saw the man who lad the power to affect me thus, and I have seen a good many in my day. You are foolish not to lhave beaid trimming on  this velvet. It is very much worn this year. Buit you must let me finish your black silk with it. It will be elegatnt round the postilion." Mrs. Vance sometimes sat a whlolo morning with usI in the sewing-room, and her lively/ off-hand descriptions of things and events, and her brilliant char- acterization of people, and ready repar.   tee, when Miss Terrapin advanced her old and threadbare theories, the pet prejudices, cobwebs rather, of a spinster over sixty, and liable every day to get older, gave agreeable variety to the dull round of needle-work, and kept our senses whetted. There had bccn no disenchantment in regard to my favorite, none what- ever, since that first morning when, in I my heart of hearts, I swore allegiance to her. She was the sort of woman who could love another woman witl a whllolc- souled, earnest, heart-deep love. There was no assumption of superiority ever others of her own sex. Her friendship deserved a better name than friendship. Hers was an elevated standard of merit, and I appreciated her richl gifts both of mind and of character. Sle was altogether devoid of flippancies, and yet gracetilly, tenderly feminine. Sometimes, I foiund myself picturing her as the wife of some Leonardus whose tastes and aspirations harmonized with her own, and who recognized and valued her with a just estirmate. She was clever as men are clever. She understood affairs, and had the power to centralize tlought, and crystallizc around her the highest foims of intellectual activity. She charmed men of Imind by her clear, logiald, and yet sIprightly and piquant way of talki(ng. Sllo was a great reader, and never failed each day to dovoto soing hours to study. If. she only would go into society a little more I It is true she occasionally at- tended a dinnter, or a private evening- entertainment, where I had urged ]her presence as a personal favor to myself, but ordinarily all her respon es to invita- tions were the same sweet negative.  I   wondered if her equilpoise would bear the test when she came to Imeet Dr. Gil- dersleeve, as she cortainlk 'must at Spicy's wedding. He hiad gone to Europe with hs invalid wife, and was travelling on the Continent now, but had promised( his brother to bo bank in timeO, even if it involved another trip across the high seas. My intimacy with Mrs. Vance was such that I visited lher as she (id me Iat any time of day or evening(, as inclina- tion or convenionce dictated. Latterly, since Fred Gildersleove was so much lt our house, I often speint the eveining with ler, as I was more lonely in my lone room, with the llappy p).ir in tlio larlor below 'me, tlian if ing one lbJad been under my roof but Iryself. On sulich occasions, she often read aldonud, and we discussed the various points in imagazine articles and new publications. One evening I found her out. I went ns usual to theo library, whch was her family sittillng-room, where her venerable "Aunt Mary " wnas looking over a pilo of letters. She was looking for her son's last. he was in MepllIris, starting a nlsi- ness of his own, and when she found it begged me to excuse her while she wrote an answer. I took a book from one of the shelves to beguile the time. It was Sparks's "Life of Washington," ann old edi- tion with gaping wounds in the back. I turned to the fly-leaf in front and read the following in pencil: "Found on a railway-car, June, 1801.--I. E. V." At the same moment, a slip of paper fell into my lap from among the leaves, and I read what was written upon it before I took time to consider that it probably had been left in the book by accident,  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7037-00000066"/> and was not intended for other eyes than the writer's. It ran thus: "I awake to a new existence. Pov- erty stares me in the face. I hear a whisper of labor and effort, which is in itself a whisper of peace. Henceforth, no more passive suffering, but a search for someithing to do. Oh I had my life but been blended with that one man's, whose heart my own comprehended I   But hush I What is life, when we come to analyze it, but a mixture of three com- ponent parts, joy, sorrow, and work? Some get tolerably equal proportions of each; some unequal, 6r they fancy so, I believe the same things comno alike to all. Years ago, when I was wading breast-high among summer-flowers, I heard a sainted lady say, 'If your trou- ble can be helped, help it; if not, bear it.' I did not comprehend the force of the passage then, but I do now. - Yes, I have had days enough of bit- ter thinking. I suppose many a one be- fore me has felt the sharp, slow, deadly e pain, which gnaws at the root of things. But, was there ever a warm, loving heart so cold and comfortless? What is the matter with the sunsets and the dawns? Why. is that great mid-day orb riding through the sky so royally but to mock my woe I! I am a sad woman defrauded of rest. My heart is a storm-beaten ark. Who says that the hand that metes out the measure to us all never yet held false balance! Can I square myself to God's will, and bury my griefs so deep that no human eye can ever pierce the wound? Can I be whatever I will to be? Can I form, and accomplish worthy purposes while my heart is withering and shrivel- ling away? Can I walk alone and with   no faltering tread? Can I build on the heaped-up ruins of my cruel past a struct- ure that will survive all future storms? Can I remember the simple fact that if life is a burden it has been imposed by God? The answer comes slowly and painfully, but comes; I can, I will." I put the paper back into the book, and the book upon the shelf, and threw myself into an easy-chair to think. Shortly after, I heard the front door open and close, and Mrs. Vance's voice from the parlor. She lad company. She had been to the weekly prayer-meeting, for she was a rigid church-member, and a gentleman had returned with her. It was a Dr. Greer, a dapper little man, with a lhead as round as a Spitzborgen apple, and covered with sandy locks, slightly flaked with white. He had a bright, agreeable  countenance, upon which was stamped, however, the label, Englishman, and was one of the largo real-estate owners of the city. He had had several business transactions witl ]Mrs. Vanco since she came in possession of her uncle's property, and then he was one of the elders in her church. I had always known him, always meaning the period of time that I had lived in Chica- go. I could not see him from where I sat, but the parlor doors were openf into the library, and I heard a part of the conversation. He had been saying some- thing in an earnest but choked voice, to which I had paid but very little atten- tion, when her reply, equally low, but more distinct, reached my ears, and the remembrance of it thrills me even now while I write: "I  shall never marry again, Dr. Greer. I have taught myself to look   forward to a blank existence. There is no staff, however dear to the womanly nature, upon which I may ever lean shel- tered from the wind. , I am outside of the pale' within which married joys are found. There is a sorrow in my heart which the world knows not of, but one which I trust is healthfully borne. I lost the cordial dlop with which Heaven graciously saw fit to sweeten my cup. I had my era of romance, 'a short-lived, delicious holiday, since when every fibre of my soul has been sharpened by the various ordeals which I have been comet pelled to pass through. My lines have not fallen in pleasant places. I shiould not be a fit companion for a man so pre- eminently worthy of a woman's best love." There was a brief silence, and then I heard Dr. Grecr's broken voice again, althoughl I could not distinguish his words more than that they were indica- tive of a question. She replied: "He was a gentleman in the high- est and finest sense, always and every- where a gentleman. I am ever ready to defend and justify my girlish affection. It has ennobled my whole life. By it, and through it, I have been so enabled to perform my duties and the work laid out for me, that there has been no time left for unavailing regrets. I believe I am a far better womnan than I should otherwise have been." Dr. Greer must have tholught she was speaking of her husband, of whom ho knew nothing, but that he had been killed in battle. But I, with my queerly- :gotten knowledge, translated differently. Mrs. Vance did not come directly to the library after showing Dr. Greer out.   Aunt Mary took off her spectacles and laid down hier pen, and wondered where  Ida had gone. "Sho can't know that you are hero?" she said to mle. "Oh, yes. nMy hat and shawl areo on the piano. Sheo could not have failed to see them." rMy servant came for meo a little later, and, thinking best not to prolong my stay, I ran up-stairs to bid Mrs. Vanceo good- night. I paused at the door of her room which was ajar, and on her'lnees befotro the flicliering grate, with her head rest- ing on an ottoman, was my dear friend, sobbing in the perfect abandon of grief. My first impulse was to fly to her and mingle my tears with hers, but the con- sciousness of wltat I knew, and how the knowledge had come to me, and of the barrier whllich she had interposed against all intermeddling with her private affaiirs, restrained me, and I ;dent slowly back to the library. "Good-night, Aunt Mary," I said; "'don't mention that I have been here, unless Mrs. Vance makes special in- quiries. I think thitt she does not know it, and, if not, it is just as well." Too mnucl wisdoln is sometimes very emlbarrassing. It was decidedly so in my case, for I wished to have a little pri- vato reunion about a week before thhe qwedding.  Loonardus was home, Dr. Gildersleeve was expected, and Fred and Spicy were in that delightful mood to bho pleased  wityi any proposition, which would fall short of an excursion through the tunnel under the lake, the now andl original inlet by which Chicago was ar- ranging to borrow fresh water from an oceanic fountain. It was in process of  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7037-00000067"/> completion, and the chief wonder of the century. It was visited by thousands of people, but we had voted it too much of a bore for our personal investigation. A dinner-party without Mrs. Vance! It could not be thought of. Would it be right for mle to bring two persons to- gether when I was the possessor of the secret of both their capacities for suffer- ing? I put the question to Leonardus. He was unwilling to advise. Her car- riage rolled up to the gate while we were discussing the question. Leonardus caught his hat, but I arrested him in his exit: "Do stop and see her; why such haste?" "I thought- some other moment might be more favorable for nmy intro- duction." "Nonsense!" She was ushered in directly. She was dressed in heavy black silk and mantle of fur, her bonnet was of dark velvet the shade of the fur, and a handsome lace veil which was attached to it was thrown back, showing her lovely facl just surrounded by a rim of white, with purple flowers over her forehead. It seems to go against all the ordinary canons of taste, but the white was beckming to her neverthleless. It was a sort of background for the daz- zling whiteness of lher complexion, from which no soft rose-flush ever went and came, but which was illumined by the rich blue of her beautiful eyes. It was so much her natural instinct to be cour- teous that she would hlave met my hus- band just as she did, under any circum- stances, warmly through her love for me, with kindly remembrance from his hav- ing been a guest once in her own house   in Boston, as well as a friend of her de- ceased husband. The allusion to their former meeting was frank and outspoken, but quickly passed by for other themes, and it was impossible not to feel that the door was permanently closed upon any further mention of it. A northheast snow-storm had just set in, a blustering reminder of my perils of the previous winter, and I rehearsed a few experiences, which were as yet new to Lconardus, and we all chatted gatyly. Presently, there was a flutter and a wel- come, and Spicy was creating a little ripple in the air by her presence in thle room. She wore one of her pretty, firesh merinos, a garnet I think it -was, and all the dainty, crisp bits of lace and bows of ribbon that are among the crowning triumphs of. millinery scemed to have lighted upon her neck and wrists. "I am   expe9tmgn Fred everv mo- ment," she said, smiling. "He has gone to the cars to meet his brother, and if he finds him, and he can be persuaded, he is going to bring lhim directly here for me to inspect." "And what if ihe brother does not suit the bride " aslked Leonardus. "It will be a grave consideration," replied Spicy. "And what of the brother's wife?" I asked. "Oh 1 did I forget to tell you? She is not comiing now. Fred has had a tele- gram. Dr. Gildersleeve has left her at a German cure -where they hold out hopes of her ultimnati recovery. Hle will re- turn to her after, lhe has seen us safely married, and attended to a few business- matters. He has struck oil. That is, thl opany that he has stock in, have   struck, and he is likely to have his pock- ets well lined." Then we all fell to discussing the oil question. I had always considered it a sort of lottery enterprise, and had been very much opposed to any investment of our funds in that direction. Cousin Pliil had sunk all his own and his moth- erCs property in the region of a Miclhigan well, and was there now  waiting for sometling to turn up. Others had met with like misfortune. Oil had suddenly become the great topic of the day. Men of all classes and conditions were excited on the subject.  A few shrewd minds and, well-formed companies had won. Ministers and editors had, in"many in- stances, invested, while careful business- men superintended operations. that Dr. Gildersleeve should htave bought shares did not surprise me, but I begged of Leo- nardus to run no risks. Mrs. Vance took the earliest moment for leaving, and as Leonardus returned to the house, after having handed her to the carriage, I askced hiln what he thought of her. "That the secret and charnm of hier singular sway over the intellect is not only her genius, but her genius all warm with the woman.  She perplexes the fancy, and affects unconsciously those among whom she is thrown, as the Inag- net the metal. In my opinion she un-- derstands the world far bettcr than the world understands, or ever will under- stand, her." "And what about the dinner-party? I feel as if that little'point must be set- tled." "Give as many   dinner-parties as you  like. Invite Mrs. Vance by  q" 9      .   means.  She will settle the question herself." "Do you mean that you think sho will decline my invitation?" "I do." Spicy was just leaving the room, see- ing no doubt that our married eyes wero quite content with one anothher. Loo- nardus stopped her. "Spicy, have you ever spoken to Fred about those old letters and their contents?" ' No. Why?" "Because I don't think it is right that you should, They concern two por- sons:whom -o have come to highly re- gard, and with whom we are very nearly connected. The Gildersloeeve family, it seelms, never knew of Grandison's early love-affair, and the facts which have be- come so painfully apparent to us ought not to boe by any possibility betrayed. Don't you agree with me?" "Yes. But it is dreadful to think I must keep a secret from my lusband I I wish wo had never found the letters; I always said no good would come of it I I knoew from the first that we should bo sorry thalt we read them -and I had the feeling that they were to bo mixed up with my. destiny, and they are. I commenced telling Fred about the ghost one eveaing, but ho interrupted mo to tell a ghost-story of his own, and I forgot to finish mine. As for the old picture, I was keeping that to surprise him with on our wedding-day. I suppose I ought to bury the whole subject, since one point cannot bo touched without ox- plaining the whole. But it will be tho cloud of my life." "You are a dear, good, reasonable  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7037-00000068"/> girl l"I exclaimed, throwing my arm around her. "The cost to you will be trifling, in comparison to the disagree- able embarrassment which  may be warded from others by your darling caution." "They've come I " she exclaimed, springing toward the- window, as two gentlemen alighted from a hack in front of the house. CHAPTER XVII. THE BRIDE AND THE BROTHER. IT was a pleasant meeting for us all. Fred Gildersleeve introduced his brother to his promised bride, with very much the air of a man who was reciting a- poem of which he was exceedingly fond. It was interesting to watch his face, while he was watching them. Dr. Gil- dersleeve brought a full bouquet of roses to Spicy's cheeks by remarking: "It is no longer a matter of surprise to me that the Benedict was ensnared." I was gla/d to meet Dr. Gildersleeve for many'reasons, and Leonardus shook his hand with the utmost cordiality. Outwardly there were few points of re- semblance between the two brothers, except in height and physique. They towered above\ ordinary mortals, and were both men Of remarkably fine pres- ence. Fred wani dark, and the wavy, brown hair, w iict we had read of in the love-corresponde ce, was getting more wavy and brownl \every day, and an ele- gant mustache set off his handsome face to great advantage. Spioy's young-lady friends pronounce, him "' splendidly fas- cinating," and repiesented themselves as   dying with envy, and, were tihere any more such in New York if they should go on there and  attend a boarding- school?  Dr. Gildersleeve was lighter, fairer, older, but one whom it would be difficult to pass in the street without a second look. He had an attractive face; char- acter, culture, and power, shone from it. I esteemed- him much the handsomer an of the two, but there is no account- ing for tastes. His active brain and cheerful mien kept reminding me/ of the little verse: "God means every man to be happy, be sure; lIe sends us no sorrows .that have not some cure. Our duty down here is to do, not to know; Live as though life were earnest, and lif will be so." I noticed that he never spoke of his wife, except when questioned. "I think she is afflicted with some terrible malady," said Spicy, when we were alone again, "because I notice that same peculiarity in Fred. He seems to avoid the subject, and once or twice has remarked upon the eminenee his brother might have attained in scholarship but for domestic interventions and constant nursings. H-Io says Grandison is a great thinker, a ready writer, just saturated through and through with genius; in fact, got all the brains in the family, and all the goodness, too. It makes me laugh to hear him go on. Ho says he would like to be as good as his brother, but he wasn't born to it; ho Only holds on to good principles by the edges, the greater part of the plank escapes him!" "We must find out whether Dr. Gil- dersleeve was really the author of that new volume of ' Synonymes,' which Mrs. Vance was showing us last week. You know what we^thought about it."   "Yes, it was he; I inquired of Fred. And he is just now upon the eve of pub- lishing another large work. Fred has copies of all the books -he has written, and after we get back from Washington I am going to make myself familiar witlI every page of them." "Washington! My dear child, that word makes me think of twentty things which ought to bo done this very day. I have put too much bff until the last week, which is always my way, you know.  I am glad you are more sys- tematic and sensible. No thanks to me, you have becn my example for many months, instead of I yours, which would have been more according to Itoyle." "Don't disparage yourself, Mcddie; you are the darlingest sister in 'the world-" "As well as the most improvident. I am glad I have you to defend me."7 "Mrs. Vance will step into every niche you leave unfilled, as usual-" "There it is, again-' as usual.' It is true, attl vec'y humiliating to reflect how much, I do lean upon Mrs. Vance. I wish I had ever been able to stand alone." I did not give the dinner-party, but both Dr. Gildersleeve and Fred dined with us nearly every day until the great day of days. It was a beautiful week -a sort of enchanted episode--partic- ularly to, the lovers. But you know the story. When you lived it you did not find it tame, or old, or commonplace. It is steet and sacred to all who hIave ever dwelt in the charmed atmosphere. Spicy was not once flurried in thea mat- ter of preparation, although she exer- cised a close supervision over every thing appertaining to her toilet. Miss   Terrapin had bent to work under orders, whether they suited her notions or other- wise, and her brideship was always ready to receive and entertain Fred without any apparent cares. Not so with your humble servant. I was like Martha of old, careful and troubled about much serving. / Mrs. Vanco did not come to see me once. I was too busy to go to her, and, consequently, we dil not meet. I missed her nmore than I could have made any one believe, and fully realized how much I had Been in the habit of consulting her inr matters of every-day life. Fred, who had been accustomed to see her tat lmy house so much since he first became a visitor, noticed and commented upon her absence. I heard him describing her to his brother on'e evening, as among the few women who really know   how  to hlandle a fortune consistently, and then lie entered into an elaborato picture of her charities, her honmes for the poor, and liher hlospitals and good works gen- erally. Dr. Gildersleevo was interested, and remarked that ho should like to know  her. All, he little dreamed how well hoi already knew hor I I wondered if the meeting with Dr. Gildersleeve was going to prove to her a martyrdom   as formidable as the fag- ots and the stake I  For, of course, she would meet him at the wedding, even if she  deserted me until then. CtlasI I had counted without my host. I awoke one morning stranded on a barren shore. A  note was brought me from my sweet friend, saying she had been summoned to  Buffalo to look after some long-un- settled business-matters connected with the estate of her deceased brother, and  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7037-00000069"/> should probably not return for some weeks. She expressed regrets at being compelled to forego the pleasure of mak- ing one of our happy number on Tues- day, and enclosed a darling little note of congratulations and kind wishes to Spicy. A little package was also deliv- ered by the same messenger, and tears were swimming in the eyes of the "bride of to-morrow, as she held up for our in- spection an exquisite and costly set of pearls. Fred and Spicy were married in St. James's Church. There was an unusual display of elegant toilets on the occasion, a crush of silk, gossamer, and lace-it was said that the creme de la cremne of both the north and south sides were present-the white-gloved, white-vested ushers ran to and fro, and were all affa- bility and attention; friends saw friends and bowed from pow to pew, uninvited guests- crowded round the doors and in the galleries, and the great organ pealed forth a joyous strain. Then came the 'hush H-and every eye was turned in eager expectation. Yes, they were com- ingI-and, as th-e imposing party passed up the aisle and divided to the right and left, and Leonardus gave away the bride, and the ceremony was duly solemnized, there was a stillness which might have revealed to quick ears the thuds of my heart, for I remembered thero e and then that I had forgotten to put on the broad belt and buckle, the crowning glory of my grand moire antique, and, what was all the more painful, I remembered just when I had forgotten it-when Leonar- dus called me, and told me that I was keeping the whole .-crowd in waiting. But, as the happy pair turned to leave   the church, there was a change in the programme, and the clearly-defined mur- mur of admiration which reached my ears all'along the route--for I was not far in their wake--swelled my sisterly heart almost to b lrsting, and led me into the comforting assurance that n'y own attire had not been criticised. Ilhad, or rather took, time to finish dressing be- fore taking my tivo hours' stand in the parlors. The reception over, and then came the adieus, and the wedding-party were on their way to Washington. I was anxious to finish the day better than I had commenced it, so I straight- ened all my parlor furniture before I re- tired. I rolled one sofa over my foot, and then cried. A little arnica relieved the pain, and a cup of coffee put me to sleep. It keeps most people awake, but I am sorry to say that I am not like most people. The next day Maggie found me crying again, and asked me what was the matter,- and I told her that Bright had shut the door against my finger and pinched it. Later, the cook camne to ask me some trivial question, and was greatly distressed to find me crying, and I ap- peased her anxiety by telling her that I had just discovered that the sewer was out of order, and was overwhelmed with dread at the prospect of having plumbers in the house. Last of all, Leonardus came late to dinner and found me crying II fe learned, to his infinite amusement,/that I had comeo to grief because the pea-soup was cold I He spent the evening wVitl mne, and tried to teach me the glorious principle of taking life as I found it. I had not lost a sister, I had only added to my possessions a brother, and-still had a husband who would shield me from want   and provide for the morrow, and, as a living evidence of the assertion, he took me in his arms, and with a smile, which disclosed a depth in his nature I never had known, he pulled the scarlet bow from my throat and fastened my collar withl a new diamond brooch.  And then he talked to me as only a true lover can talk, and the mIore I looked and listened the more I discovered in him perfections unnoticed before. Ah! all that soul said to sojul, or that heart gained from heart, in that blessed interview who shall eCn- roll? What is it that so often childs two beings who are united for life? Not the absence of love so much as the ignorance of how love is nourished by love. We expected that Fred and Spicy would spend their first wedded year with us; but, immediately after their return from the bridal journey, there. was a change in their plans. Fred had been more successful in some of his spec- ulations than he had even anticipated, and decided to purchase a handsome mir- ble-front house on the avenue, which was in the market at a bargain, and go to house-keeping. They fitted it up prettily, but did not furnish it all at once, r&amp;serv- ing their choicest selections until such time as convenient to jaunt East together and explore the world of art and beauty. It was April before Mrs. Vance re- turned, to find Spicy for a neighbor on the next block below her. She called immediately, but she declined Spicy's first invitation to dinner, and did not visit me quite as freely as heretofore, al- though there was not the slightest change in her friendship or demeanor. Dr. Gil- dersleeve was not with us often. I hoped she was not staying away through fear   of imeetincg him, but I dared not speak to her on the subject.        ^ And while I was revolving the ques- tion in my mind, the air was all at once solemn with the tolling of bells I Minute- guns reverberated from  mountain to mountain across this great continent! The cities, the towns, the hamlets of 'our broad land were draped in mourningl The nation's heart had e  touched by the finger of deatl I The President of tho United States of America had been felled by an assassin I Chicago was in tears. A[en spoke to eachl other on the streets with quivering lips. terclants closed thhcirstorcs. Black and whllite goods seemed to fall as with one accord from every building. Five years before that very month, the same city blossomed with flags and echoed to the booming of calnnon, and the jubilations of assembled thousands, as the news was announced that the convention in the Lake - Street Wigwam had nominated Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, as its stand- ard-bearer. Chicago honored and loved him. It was in ]lor courts that lie first laid deep and broad the foundation of his legal attainments, and gained that distinction which placed him peerless amo the ablest counsellors in the land. It was Chcago who first summoned him firom comparative obscurity in a political sense, and watched with pride hiwrestle with an able and 'cunning debater, until his sagacity and honesty and purity had been established beyond question. Chi- cago had sent him out a brave, earnest, hlopeful, Christian man to save t]lo coun- try. And, just as hts work was finished, the Republic vindicated, its enemnies over- thrown and suing for peace, lie llad  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7037-00000070"/>  been slain-slain, while interposing the hand of his great charity and mercy be- tween the wrath of the people and guilty traitors I A few days later, and the people of Chicago tenderly received his sacred ashes, with bowed heads and streaming eyes. No other community did itself such peculiar honor by the vast magni- tude, the perfect order, and the solemn beauty of the funeral obsequies. About thirty-six thousand persons participated as members of organized military, civic, municipal, educational, religious, and other associations, apart from at least one hundred thousand citizens who thronged the line of the procession from curb-stone to house-top. Leonardus was one of the grand marshals, and took me at evening to the broad hall in the court-house above where the remains were being viewed, and where over one hundred of Chicago's best singers were assembled, who, with soft, sweet, mel- ancholy strains, added sublimity to the universal sorrow. A pitiless rain was pouring upon the long lines of people who surged through the rotunda during the sad hours of the night, but it occa- sioned no diminution in their numbers. At intervals dirges, both solos and con- certed pieces, were sung, suitable to the time and place. At midnight a beautiful and impressive dirgo was chanted by all present with thrilling effect. It was one of the most interesting incidents of this long-to-be-remombered occasion. Charity I Scarcely were the remains of our loved chief magistrate laid in their native earth, when charity was again tie theme in Chicago. Another Sanitary Fair,'to raise funds to minister to the ?   wounded and dying men of our armies; a Fair prodigious in its proportions, gor- geous in its display, admirable in its ar- rangements. GCicago laid the corner- stone of the finest palace ever reared by civilized humanity, when she inaugu- rated the first Sanitary Fair. New York, Phhadelphia, Cincinnati, Boston, and other cities, reared thereon a glorious superstructure, and now Chilcago was determined to crown the lofty dome amid the clouds-an everlasting monu- ment of the gratitude and generosity of the American people. The two great armies of the Union were on the homeward route. They had won magnificent victories, accomplished vast results, came off more than con- querors, done and dared and suffered all that men can do and dare and suffer in the cause of popular government and human freedom, and justice and right. They were returning to exchange the discomforts and privations of the camp for their own firesides. They had poured out their blood in rivers. They had left their dead in thousands; but they had crowned the nation with present )less- ings, and heaped up for it prospective honors. Chicago was not content with bestowing medals on the living, and rear- ing statues in memory of the fallen. Vet- erans, who had left positions of honor and profit, which were now filled by others, must be cared for. Those who, had come back incapacitated for work by reason of wounds, must be cared for. Ience this gigantic Fair, which culmi- nated in magnificent success. I took an active part in the art and trophy department, and was doomed to four weeks. of lrrd labor. Spicy was   there, Mrs. Vance was there, everybody was there who was not in so e other department. No one thought of staying at home while the Fair lasted. It was a continuous holiday, a gay festival, which was fully appreciated and enjoyed by visitors, though a season of incessant toil to those who were employed therein. But all were inspired by love for the cause, and hardships were hailed as a positive pleasure. And still, with steady tramp, the heroic legions came-not as they went, with gay colors and full ranks, h but worn, weary, bronzed, with tattered rags fluttering in the breeze, and vacant places in their ranks. They were all welcomed at the Fair by theotruest hearts that ever beat responsive to the calls of gentle philanthropy. Neither last nor least came our two great generals, and enthusiasm was at its height. I looked around me, wonder- ing whether the building would stand the crush, or yield, like the Temple of Dagon of the Philistines, under the press- ure of Samnpso-for surely I knew they brought the gates of other cities with them. Half bewildered I b Lv Loonardus among the celebrities on the platform, and presently a rich, deep voice pro- nounced the words of welcomo to our illustrious guests in behalf of the man- agers of the Fair. It was that of Dr. Gilderseeve. GGeneral Grant called upon Goveroor Yates, of Illinois, to respond for him, which he did. The cry of the multitude was then for General Sherman, who arose and remarked pleasantly: "I am not here for the purpose of ' making a speech; I am here, like your- selves, merely as a spectator. I have   always been ready to obey my loved commander-in-chief, but I am sure he will not order me to make a speech." General Grant, standing near, smiled, and, advancing, said: "I never order a soldier to do lny thing that I cannot do myself." How the hall rang with applause at the happy retort! On some accounts distinction may be desirable, but it is certainly invested with many inconveniences and perplexihies, which detract sadly from its pleasures. I was led to that sage remark by the re- membrance of how General Grant'made many and hopeless efforts to see somee of the beauties of the Fair. The crowd followed his Inost trifling movements. We made one grand effort to inveigle, hm into the picture-gallery, which was one of the finest collections of paintings ever exhibited on this continent; but it wasja hopeless failure, and his arms were nearly wrenched from his shoulders by the eagerness of tleo multitude to grasp his hand. Fred Gilderslcove said he would r4ther be happy than great; and I thought Spicy, who stood leaning on his arm, looked very much as if she co- incided in the samno opinion. Dr. Gildorsleevc sailed for Europe in July. A little later Leonardus took nme to the White Mountains and to Now- port, and during the autumn following we went to Havana, so that for nearly a year I spent but a few woeksl at homo. When I once more returned to our newer civilization and my corner house, I was introduced to a young lady who was the fac-similo of my sister Spicy, as seen through the wrong end of an opera-glass. She was the baby of babies. Thero had  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7037-00000071"/> never been another before her, in the es- timation of her delighted parents. Fred stopped Leonardus On the street to tell him the color of her eyes. Spicy told me, to the hour and minute, how old she was when she first laughed.    S But if Miss Lulu Gildersleeve was the most remarkable girl who ever craminmd her fists into her mouth, and screamed when she was not rocked or jouncedc about, then I hardly know how to im- press you with the importance of the characteristics of the young Chicagoan, Tobias, who appeared upon the stage of action about a year and a half later, and who couldexact more attention, and drive more nurses frantic, than any other youth of his size in all the West, The years were gliding noiselessly by. Stirring events were not the fasliion any more, either in city or household. We had fallen naturally and eapily into old relations and habits, and Miss Terrapin continued to quote me among her cus- tomers. Mrs. Vance was still my bosom friend, and we both entered as heartily and graciously as ever into any and every plan which brought Vfs together. We fully reciprocated each other's entertain- ments and invitations; we had our read- ings and our literary circles, and, except that Mfrs. Vance had gradually widened the sphere of her acquaintance, there was no perceptible change in the atmos- phere of our intercourse. She was called the brilliant Mfrs. Vance by those who were favored by an admittance to her select little gatherings, but the subtle undercurrent of her life was Christian charity.  The good she did in her quiet, unpretending way could not bo told in a thousand volumes, and all the graces   of benevolence seemed to pursue in her train. The poor followed her to praise and to bless. She wrote occasionally. sometimes a story so effective in narra- tive as to utterly astonish me; then, again, poetry would reel from her pen, revealing sympathies ready and keen, and a large, warm heart ineffably tender and loving. She never published any thing under her own name, but her im- personal articles frequently found their way into the leading periodicals. She was essentially healthy in mind and body, and I felt that no one sooner than she would ha-ve laughed to scorn sickly fancies and imaginary woes. Dr. Gildersleeve was in Chicago a part of every year, and in Europe the remainder.   But he was always very much engrossed while in the city, and the collision between himself -and Mrs. Vance, which had seemed to me almost inevitable, had never occurred. Spicy's home had grown to be one of the most charming in Chicago. They had furnished it by degrees, never buying any thing that was not the most choice, as well as the most costly, of its kind. Their parlors were gems of beauty, and every thing was in the most perfect taste; their paintings would have graced the mansion of any connoisseur in art. In the great whole they had studied ef- fect with so much effect, that the most pleasing effect was produced. i Spicy named her second boy Grand- ison, and received from his uncle on the next Christmas an elegant little coupe, and a pair of beautiful horses-" nobby " Fred called them-as a token of blis ap- preciation of the notice. Spicy was'ne who rarely ever showed exultation over   any thing of the kind; but, when she drove over in her now carriage to call upon and show it to me, her eyes were ablaze with delight. I wished the giver could have seen her with her whole soul speaking from her face ag I did, and lho would have realized the exquisite pleas- ure he had conferred. '"Dear Meddie," she said, "you know lhow I have always wanted a carriage. It -has seemed of late as if nmy life, or some one else's life, or something of ex- ceeding great magnitude, depended upon it; and yet, I would not for the world lhave been so foolish as to have asked Fred to buy one until we were older, and more dignified and sedate. Now it has come unexpectedly, just as every other good thing has colme to me all my life I Isn't it nice? Don't you like the trimmings? Oh, I am so happy with it!" Leonardus had business that prom- ised to detain him in New York City through most of the summer of 1871, and ho went out to 'a little village of villas on Long Island Sound, and re'nted a furnished cottage. It was a beautiful point, shaded and picturesque. I en- joyed thoe salt air and sea-bathing, and Bright was happy as a young king, with llis twenty acres of private play-ground and hs cliffs and grand old trees. Fred and Spicy made us a flying visitW in August, and it so happened that Mrs. Vance was able to time her summer's journey to meet them at our house. We exhausted our country resources for their amusement; fished and rowed and( yachted, played croquet, took lessons in swimming, and drove over the fineo roads in our little dog-cart. Last of all we   went on a shopping-expedition to the city, in view of a gay *iinter in Chicago. Wo had done all the prominent stores pretty thoroughly, and were hurrying toward the Now-Havcn train with our hands full of packages, wlhon Spicy re- nembered that sho 1ad promised to call upon a friend in Harlem, and this would be her only opportunity. Mrs. Vanuco proposed to go directly home, while I went with Spicy to thoe Third-Avenue cars. We had to stanid at first, as peo- ple who ride there usually do, but at last obtained seats by squeezing in be- t^ween tvo largo women.  When wo went to get out at One IIu  ndred andn Twentieth Street I missed my pocket- book. I told Spicy on the platform of tho car. Sho thought we had better look for it, and whilo we were talking, the car started. I spoke to thlo con- ductor, and lieo looked on the floor to see if I had dropped it. I stepped in and assisted in the search. "Wall, indado, an' I thought it was you yourself, Mrs. Behlnoro. Say, an' have ye got a good cook now? I'm jest lookin' for a place, an' I makes tlinigs illigatnt you know, anll' I can colno ri'ght away too." It, was the large womllan, who thad been sitting next me, who thus ad- dressed me, and it took ibut a second :look for me to recognize in liher my Ann of Clicago memory. "How do you do?"  I said, pleas- antly. "Did you see my pocket-book?" "Bless your dare hecart, an' was it yours sure? I. picked one up on tleo floor-here it is!" and my property was again in my possession, to my great de- light. "Where do ye live, ma'am? I  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7037-00000072"/> can go right away with ye--I'm all riddy."         . "No, I don't want a cook; I'm obliged to you."  Spicy had stopped thd car, and I stepped along to get out.  "You have taken us s6mewhat out of our way," she remarked to the c n- ductor. "Sit right down, ladies, and I will take you back again," he replied. We both remonstrated, but the horses were taken off one end of the car a id attached to the other end, tind we were set down at the right corner. We both laughed; it was a courtesy fiever before shown us on a public conveyance. As the conductor assisted us off, he lifted his hat, and said: "Tell General Be}moreo that Tom Harris remembers his kindness at Vicks- burg," and as we had to hurry to the sidewalk, to get out of the way of a carriage, we had no chance to rep'y, for the horses speedily camne round to the fore-end of the car, and it started off at a brisk rate to make up for lost time. "Poor Ann; so she has not acquired honesty by length of years," I said. "And yet she cooks jest as illigant as over," remarked Spicy, with a laugh. "Who ever expected to meet hier agai? It has brought that old ghost-affair Ill fiesh to my mind. It was very myste- rious about that apparition in the blue- room, wasn't it?"   CHAPTER XVIII. DR. GILDERSLEEVE'S SUNDAY-EVENING CALL. IT was one Sunday evening, shortly after our return from the sea-shore, that we were agreeably surprised by a call from Dr. Gildersleeve. He had arrived in the city on Saturday morning, and taken rooms at the Sherman House. He had brought his wife with h this time, although she was able to be moved only on a bed. IIcr mother, Mrs. Hortense, was in attendance, but herself suffering with a sprained ankle. elo had been so fortunate as to secure in NTew York an old nurse who had lived with them while in Peculiarville, and congratulated him- self that the ladies would both receive all necessary care. I expressed great interest, and asked if a call from me would be. agreeable to them. "Certainly. But Mrs. Gildersleeve's. mental condition is such that I am afraid it will afford you but poor satisfaction. During the past twelve years she has liad but few lucid intervals, and I havo but little hope left that her rcason will ever be restored." A gust of wind blew the front-door open, and Leonardus sprang to close it. "Did you see the fire last night?" he asked, addressing Dr. Gildersleeve. "Yes. I was in the editorial office, writing an article for the next issue of my paper, when I was informed of it, and went over to thb west side. Is4aw Dr. Greer at work upon the roof of one of his large buildings, endeavoring to save it, and, knowing there was but one means of exit, I considered him in great   danger, and with much difficulty suc- ceeded in gaining admission in order to warn him. The danger was averted, however, and we remained together all night on the roof, looking down upon the many burning blocks, the greatest conflagration it will probably ever be our lot to witness." "Have you seen Spicy?"I asked. "Yes, I ran in a few moments yes- terday. What a charming mother she makes I I found her entertaining her three little ones with a miniature oeloci- pede, which sho had just bought. My pre- cocious little namesake was intent upon experimenting personally, and toddled after the contrivance until it was over- taken, and he had crowned his ambition by a seat upon it. Poor fellow!-lie took his first lesson in the perishability of earthly joys," and a rare smile played over the face of the speaker. "Did you see Fred in Now York?" asked Leonardus. "   Yes, I stopped at the St. Nicholas, where he stays. He will be home in about two w^eks. He is making so much money thalt I am afraid he will not know what to do with it, and I have been ad- vising hiim to take a rest. I know of no one more supremely blessed tilan he seems to be in his business, and in his family. HeH ought to be, and is, I be- lieve, fully appreciative." Was he drawing comparisons, this man of such singular balance of char- acter, and the records of vhose honor- able and prosperous career were so de- void of blemish? My thoughts were turned into another channel, the next moment, by his remark: "General Belmore, it strikes me that   in all modern history there is nothing quite so marvellous and captivating as the growth of Chicago. I am moro and more impressed with it every time I re- turn from abroad. The immense hotels and business-blocks which have shot into being within the last five or six years, stop me in wonder as I pass them. It appears almost incredible that the site of such a city as Chicago is to-day, should, forty years ago, have been only a great, reedy, miasmatic marsh on the shore of an inland sea! -and that an even dozen of log-cabins gave shelter to less than a hundred fur-dealers. Seeoo - it is but a few years since, tired of the mud and marsh anud miasma, she lifted herself to six or eiglt feet of higher level. I shall never forget my sensations when I first saw large hotels suspended in the air, wlhilo new founda- tions were being laid and nelow base- mernts built. There seems never to have been any project too bold, or enterplris too great, for her to undertake. Sloe has been sufficient for herself in all emer- gencies. Slih takes rank with great capitalls. Hers,- after New York, is the best-known name in Europe, and there is lo stoiy too will in relation to lher but will obtain credence there. Now, since the blridges have not been found adequate to the demand for travel across the river, highways have been construct- ed underneath, and to conquer that same river, wlich was obstinate about dis- charging its filth into the lake, the lake has not only been turned into theo river, but the whole emptied into the Gulf of Mexico!" Leonardus, half reclining on  the lounge, with his cigar in the tips of lis X  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7037-00000073"/> fingers, laughed, without answering im- mediately. . "And yet the whole world, and Eu- rope in particular, will persist in styling us 'brags,' if we by chance mention such facts. I think that if there is any class of men entitled to the privilege of bragging, it is those who have lent their aid toward making Chicago what she is," he said, at last. "What a gale "I exclaimed, start- ing up as one of the shutters come against the window with such force as to shiver a pane of glass. "It is a terrible night! I believe I will hurry back to the hotel before the rain sets in. These southwest winds are portentous," and Dr. Gildersleeve rose and buttoned his coat. Leonardus went to the door with him. He called me directly to see the new fire, which was lighting up the heavens with a strange, unnatural hue. Dr. Gildersleeve said it must be full five miles away. Leonardus remarked: "You go to bed, Meddie, and I will walk over to the south side with Dr. Gilderslceve and see where it is." "Oh, don't "I exclaimed, with much anxiety in my look and tone, "Never fear, wifey, I sha'n't go to the fire; I shall be back in an hour at farthest," and lie kissed me and went on. People were just hurrying home from  church through streets brilliant with gas, some being drifted along without effort of their own in a northerly direction, i while others were contending against  the sharp storm of dust in order to reach e localities nearer the river. One of my  servants, who had had a "Sunday out,"   returned just then, and, seeing me in the door-way, turned to come up the steps, and was blown against the railing with such force that her hand was bleeding. I took hold of her and lelped her in, and it required all of our united force to close the door. The gas-jets in the hall and  parlor had all been extinguished by the fury of the blast, and we had to relight them. I was not robust in health, and thought best to retire. My room was in the northeast corner of the house,mie most remote from the street, and the least likely to be penetrated by noise or disturbance. I drew my shutters to- gether close, and pulled down the shades. The bells rung near by for a few minutes, and then stopped. I wondered how the fire would be subdued in the face of such a wind, and wondered who would be able to alleviate the ocean of misery it must occasion. I fell asleep, but only to dream of Leonardus and fire-bells. I waked sev- eral times, just enough to think, "Why,  the whole world must be on fire!" but I slept again after eachi waking. A little past midnight I started up, whirled up the window-shade and looked out. The heavens were one broad, lurid glare, ex- cept' when great black fiery columns of smoke rushed past. The sight appalled me. Where was Leonardus? Why had he not returned? What fearful disaster was impending over Chicago? I shivered with cold or nervousness, 'it mattered not which, and I drew down the shade again and got into bed and cov- ered my head with the bedclothes; but I slept no more. I was hearkening, con- stantly, for Leonardus's step in the hall.   Ice would certainly come soon to tell me the terrible news, whatever it was. I could hear men screaming and swearing in thd distant street; I could hear a strange roar, which I supposed was the wind. Then came a jar, and a reverbera- tion like distant thunder. What was that?  My door-bell I - ringing, ringing, ringing! Would it not stop long enough for me, to get to it? Leonardus must have lolt his key. Down the stairs I flew, not even taking the precaution to throw a shawl about me. No, it was not Leonardus; it was Mrs. Vance's coachman, and he wanted to bring Mrs. Chafferlec, Mrs. Vance's dear aunt Mary, in. Would I help him? Why, wliat is the matter-is the whole south side on fire,? Yes, and Mrs. Vance had sent her to me for safety. I caught a water-proof from the hat- rack-it was singularly fortunate that it should have happened to have been there, one good result of negligent house- keeping- and ran out to the carriage with bare feet. What help could I ren- der, slight, frail, weak creatifre that I was, and Mrs. Chafferlee, though much emaciated by reason of old age and long illness, being of a largo, bony frame, full twice my size? "I can get hold of her, ma'am, only I am rough-like and hurt her," said the kind-hearted coachman. "Never mind, never mind. Make haste; I want you should get back to Ida," came from the feeble voice inside. The great, clumsy fellow grabbed her and ran up the steps, I holding upon the skirts of her dress just enough to retard his free progress. He laid her upon the sofa in the parlor, for he was afraid he   should drop her if hle undertook to as- cend a flight of stairs. Then he ran and brought in a basket, and a bundle of loose things tied up in a shawl. When he was gone, I tried to light tho gas, and it would not burn. I won- dered if any thing had happened to the gas-works. The room was almost as light as day, however. I got a pillow for Mrs. Chafforleo, and fanned her, for she seemed faint. Some of Mrs. Vanco's valuables, I supposed them to bo, had scattered through the hall when the coachman threw thonm in, by th unty- ing of the shawl which held1 them, and I went out and gathered them up. I did not stop to look at them, I only noticed a jewel-case, some packages of papers, marked important, a small ledger, and-could it bo possible Hyes, the very identical little picture of Bright, upon ivory, which I had given to Nursy Brown cight years before I The whole mystery of that "person " was thus suddenly revealed. I saw. it all -her incomparable goodness, and the greatness of theo woo which could have driven her to such a refuige. And the germ of all that love, witIh ;lich sle had since been boindI to me-all, tle secret she had probably intended to keep until her death Wllat a strange, new light had burst upon me-what a horrid light was glaring in from without I I must dress. I could not be running about the house in that condition, and people coming, too. Otlers might fly to us as well as Mrs. Vanco. I called Bright, my little man of ton years, and told him to slip on his clothes and run down and stay with "Aunt Mary," while I made my toilet. had I better call tlo  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7037-00000074"/> servants? Monday was a busy day for them, and it was hard that they should lose their sleep. I had got my hair up respectably, topsies and all, when I concluded I had better call the servants, and ran through into the wing where they slept. It was their first waking, and they were stunned with the horrid spectacle from without. "The fire is on this side of the river, I am sure," said Maggie, who was one of those rare appendages to the house- hold who had proved faithful for many years. "Oh, it can't be; there is no danger here," I replied. "And the clothes-lines will all be getting full of soot and dust, and I shall have such a boggle about drying my clothes this week again," whined Esther, the cook. I hurried to my room and took down a heavy alpaca dress to put on; then the heat was so great, or I was feverish, and I changed it for a lighter material. I could not find my collar with the double points, and then I took a distaste to the Roman scarf I had worn that Sunday, and actually spent several minutes hunt- ing for a " made bow" of scarlet, with which to adorn my throat. My over- shoes were lying upon the floor in one corner of my room, and, without know- ing why, I put them on; then I spread tp my bed, put away my brush and comb, picked up loose pins, and stuck them in the cushion, and, last of all, took down a little feather-duster, which al- ways hung by the window, and dusted the bureau and table. I was literally setting my house in order. Bright called me. "Aunt Mary"   was so still and didn't speak to him, and he was afraid something was the matter with her. His eyes were very large- they resembled two luminous fire-balls- and I ran my hand through his soft hair to reassure him. I found she had fainted quite away, and threw some water it her face, which had been left in the par- lor overnight, and she breathed againl presently. Once she spoke: "It seems as if the last great day had come. I am afraid Ida will be trampled to death. She got out of the carriage to help a poor woman." "Good Heavens!"I exclaimed. "But Richard will surely find her," I said, a moment after. The noise without grew louder and morel ominous. It seemed as if a legion of demons had been let loose in the streets. Then there was a jar, like the one I had heoard before, which stilled, or seemed to still, for an instant, the surg- ing crowds. Could it be thunder, while the stars were shining?-for I had seen them a moment ago. No; it was gun- powder, and the terrible suspicion flashed upon me even then. --Bright, peering through the lace on the vestiblule-win- dows, saw blazing sparks and bits of burning wood light in our front-yard. "Mamma, our house is catching I Wo must run!   Come, comne, come!l" he screamed, tugging at my garments. I looked out, and surely a wall of fire was advancing upon our midnight help- lessness. Where, oh, where was Leo- nardus? Where was Mrs. Vance? What should I do with Mrs. Chafferlee? I put my two arms around Bright and groaned. But the man in him was not for stands ing there idle.   "Let me go for a carriage, malmma!" "My boy, how could I let you out into that terrible street?" and so great was the roar and din, as if earth and sky were rushing to ruin together,.that I had to raise my voice to be distinctly leard. Bright put his face close to the win- dow once more, and I stood looking through, just abover him. The fire was tearing madly among the beautiful man- sions not a block away.   In different directions a dozen great sweeping scythes of flame seemed trying to outrun, and then made horrible dashes into each other. the swirls of smoke and sparl;ks swept over the fire-chased tthrongs be- fore our eyes. Frantic men were drag- ging bundles and trunks; women were running in their night-clothes; little chil- dren, with ghastly faces, were visible now and then, and afterward lost to our sight; trucks, filled with goods and peo- ple, and carringcs, drawn by struggling, foaming horses, and lined with white, scared faces, were flying on, on, onward. "Is it hell, mamlma?-and   will it overtake us anywhere, that you don't try to get away?" came from the philo- sophic little boy, and I had no answer to give in my terror-dazed despair. What is that?-a carriage stopping? Who-yes, it is Leonardus!   And I opened the door, admittingvvolume of smoke and ashes and flying gravel into the hall, which nearly put out my eyes. He was already upon the steps; his hat was gone, a piece of blue mosquito-net- ting was tied over his forehead and eyes, and his coat was torn and dangling in shreds about him. I should have ruschd into his arms with a cry of joy, but he put me back:   "Not a minute to lose, wifey. Catohl somethng i y    your haiis-what you care to save most-call the servants.-Bright, spring into the carriage.-I'll carry out Mrs. Chafferlee." "What I care to save mostl'  I roe- peated to myself, as I flow wildly to my room. I opened a closet-door and took down an Astrakllhan cloak and put it on, pulled the counterpane from the bed, spread it on the floor, and, from a bu- reau-drawer, pulled out n quantity of underwear, rolled it up, and, with the bundle in my hland, rushed down to thle door. The wind took mly bundle from me, and nearly twisted me over the rail- ing of the steps.- In a moment Lconar- dus had his arm firmly round my waist, and assisted me to the carriage. Maggie was there already, supporting Mrs. Chaf- feorle'C head in her arms. Esther was waiting to get in, and was begging some one to go for her trunk. Bright calme running with his cat and his dog, one under each arm, and his stamnp-album in his hand.  Last of all Leonardus pushed in my bundle, slalmmoed the door -there was no room for him-and told Richard to drive to Mrs. Grant's, on Clark Street, about two miles farther north. Great firebrands were falling all about us, and theo horses reared, plunged, and snorted. At the very first move forward the wheels were interlocked with those of a heavy omnibus, and I thlought wo were going to be hlopleCssly broken down. Diagonally across tlo street a handsome three-story hlouse was burn- ing; and, looking back to see wthat hld become of Leonardus, I was just in time to witness the huge serpent of hissing  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7037-00000075"/> flame which was springing from the roof of our own darling cottage. Wlhere had it come from, and how could it have got there so soon? Ten minutes more, and only a pile of red-hot embers marked where our home had been. There were dense eddies of smoke all about us, which ) every now and then cleared away with brilliant scintillations. The moving fig- ures appeared like imps- of brimstone. Our terrified hlorses began to neigh, and it was with difficulty that they were urged along. I was more like one dead than living. I saw, and yet I felt that I saw not. '"Isn't thlat Miss Terrapin?" screamed Bright in my ears. I looked the wrong way. He put his hand on my face, and turned it round to where two women wero drawing an- other woman in a chair. But they' were too far behind now for me to recognize them, even if they had been 'persons whom I knew. "The lady with her beckoned to us, and throw out her arms, and I think sihe screamed," continued Bright; "I suppose so-evorybody screams," I replied. I should not have spoken quite so mechanically if I had known that it was Mrs. Vance herself who had made a fran- tic effort to arrest the attention of her own coachman, and who was toiling along on foot, determined to save other. life than her own, in the maddened crowd, with the great, blasting, seething, leeking sea of fire chasing and exhaust- ing her. Would the wilting wind never die? In one awful moment a bright blaze seemed to detach itself from the main   body and leaped over our heads, drop- ping down into the street about a block in advance, rendering the whole pathway a sea of flame. What should we do? To turn back was certain death. The side- streets were already blockaded. It was only go on. Richard applied the lash, and the excited animals tore through the passage. We bounded against vehicle after vehiclc-once with such force that Bright was tlrown against the glass in the carriage-window, breaking it. Saved --but stop, there is a wagon on fire loaded with mattresses, and a lady in her night-clothes leaping from it. She is all ablaze I Who will help her? "Richard, Richard, leave your horses and run to her I No, some humane indi- vidual has anticipated you, and the fire about her person is extinguished. But stop, I say; let me call to her." "Dear me, and you wouldn't carry my trunk, and the towels are in it that my good mother sent me all the way from Ireland I " growled Esther. It was impossible to'induce the horses to stand still, and a man, who could think of others as well as himself in that awful hour, took them by the head, and I seized the lady by her hand and drew her into the carriage with us. "I don't know where you are going  to get the room if you invite all the folks you- pass to ride," continued the grum- bling Esther. "Let me curl down anywhere," cried the lady, with a frantic gesture. Should we ever get to our haven? Cursingnen, shrieking women, terrified horses, were everywhere impeding our progress. People, with heavy burdens, were constantly getting entangled with   wagons and carts and outcasts. Many ladies had put on their finery to save it; others, like myself, had grasped for theo least impofrtant of all their possessions. Invalids were being borne on stretchers, old, gray-haired men were hobbling on crutches, feeble women were panting and fainting, and yet dragging themselves onward, sometimes clasping huge bun- dles. I saw one half grown girl carry- ing a drop-light, and a lady in a dressing- gown of chintz and a velvet cloak run- ning with a tumbler of jelly in her land. It was an extraordinary scene-lhorrible, ludicrous, mournful, and grotesque, as the visions of a nightmare. We arrived at Mrs. Grant's hlouse at last, and went in. They were packing and preparing to leave. There seemed to be no place for us there. I asked for something to wrap round the lady whom I blad befriended, for the sun was up now and sho had no clothes. I never knew when the sun came up, and I hardly recognized its fiendish face, constantly changing and making grimaces at our misery. Nor was it hardly ligrltor than when, in the night, I had first looked out into the firelit darkness. I noew that Mrs. Grant couldn't save every thing, and she might give the stranger a dress. I said so, and she told me to ihelp my- self to one, and I did. I found a pair of stockings, and a pair of gaiter-boots also, and a sea-shore hat. I looked in the lady's face while I was trying to draw her scorched and tangled hair out of her eyes, and saw that she was pretty and young-that is, if you call thirty young. I do. I don't know but I asked her who she was, for I did a good many things that day that I do not hold myself ac- 10   countable for; but, at all events, I learned that she was married only the week before in Noew York City, and was with her husband in Cliicago on their wedding-trip. They were stopping at the Tremont, and had no time to dress after the first alarm that the hotel was in danger. They succeeded in getting themselves and their baggage conveyed to the corner of Rush and Indiana Streets; but the fire followed so rapidly that they were obliged to fly farther, and her husband disappeared. She did not know what became of him, and, after being jammed along withl the crowd for a tilme, she managed to ge bletween the mattresscs on the wagon, from which sfo had narrowly escaped with hoer life into our carriage. Such was Mrs. IIu- beoljido's experience. But our terrible foe was opposed to our taking a rest. On, on it came, lick- ing up the pretty cottages, and thhe blocks of brick and marble, and the stately churches, and the mammoth breweries, and the massive water-works, leaving only charred and blackened and smok- ing masses in its wake. IHow far must weo be driven?--wo, who were already six or seven miles from where it first started I Leonardus came at last. I scarcely knew him, ho looked so haggard and dirt-begrimed. "Where did Richard go with the car- riage?" ho asked, breathlessly. I did not know; I had taken no no- tice of the coachman after he had de- posited Mrs. Chaffrlooe on Mrs. Grant's bed. I might have been more thought- ful, that is, if I had been anybody else but Medley Belmore.  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7037-00000076"/> "It he is hopelessly gone, then I must try to find some other way of removing you," exclaimed Leonardus, running out into the pitiless fire-storm. "'Where is General Belmore -will he help' us?-what is he going to do?" and similar questions, reached my ears from different members of Mrs. Grant's family,'as I watched him running up and down, this way and that, jostling with the motley mass of fugitives on their fearful race for life, and, at last, leading a raw-boned, jaded mule up before the bay-window, with its fanciful drapery, from which I had seen agony and suffer- ing enough depicted on the passing faces to have filled more books than the world could hold. A mule-what was he going to do with it? No matter where he had found it. Somebody said he took it forcibly from a boy, who hlnd been left as its keeper. I should not be surprised if that was so, for civilities were only the exceptions, not the rule, on that day. Bright, dear, loving Bright-never was a boy more truly named-ran out to his father and was sent for Mrs. Grant's clothes-line. Then was manufactured a harness, such a one I am sure the world has never seen. A grocer's wagon, which had lost a wheel and been left to its fate in the middle of the street, was resus- citated through some manipulations with which I am not familiar, the mule fast- ened to it, a mattress of Mrs. Grant's laid in for the comfort of poor, distressed, but patient Mrs. Chafferlee, the rest of us huddled as compactly as possible, and with Leonardus to lead and coax the astonished and protesting mule, and Bright bringing up the rear with his cat and his dog, we joined the grand hegira.   It was a wonder that we were not all smitten with total blindness from cinders and overwhelming dust. The wind was a hurricane, and we could scarcely hold fast enough to the wagon to keep from being blown from it; and it was doubt- ful whether the wagon, even, would hold together until we could be transported to a place of safety. The prairie at last! And in a dry ditch by the side of the way we alighted, for both harness and wagon had failed. Night-tearful, illumined, tempestuous night-and the skies only for our cover- ing; we who had until now been so well housed and cared for. The story of prairie-fires was fresh in our minds, for all over the West the woods were still burning, and the fiend was in sight, not so very far away. Might we hope to escape the still greater danger in store for us? Leonardus spoke hopefully and worked manfully. He was trying to hitch the fractious mule to the refrac- tory Wagon-and we awaited our fate. CHAPTER XIX. THE FIRE ON THE SOUTII SIDE. MEANWHLE where were our friends? I learned later, but my readers shall not be kept in suspense. When Leonardus and Dr. Gildersleeve reached the Sher- man House the night before, people were in great excitement about the fire, which was on the west side, between De Koven and Polk Streets; and among the warped and weather-beaten shanties, where the streets were unpaved, and littered with old boxes, broken barrels, mildewed pa- pers, and other tinder, as dry and crisp   as if they had been specially prepared for the occasion. Dr. Gilderslcove went to his rooms to look after the welfare of his wife and mother, and, finding them resting quietly, proposed to Leonardus to go and inspect the movements of the firemen, and see what progress the flames were making. The sky was lighted up for miles around, and the river looked like a vast stream of blood. They went to the top of several largerbuildings, and finally proceeded southwestward as far as Van- Buren-Street bridge. The firemen were working like heroes, but the fire had got under headway and the winds were blow- ing a gale. The poor people, who were being made houseless witl a rapidity which defies description, were throwing beds and all kinds of furniture from the windows of tenement-houses, into hete- rogeneous masses upon the sidewalks, obstructing the passage to and fro of the fire - companies, and preventing what little chance there was of staying the onward rush of the flames. Leonardus found the marshal of the fire depart- ment, and, after a brief consultation, telegraphed for him to some of tile neighboring cities for immediote help. But, of course, it must come slowly. Fire-engines could not be telegraphed back. Milwaukee was the nearest point from which they could be obtained, and hours must elapse before they could ar- rive from there. Then Leonardus organ- ized a body of men to work upon the roofs of buildings, and extinguish burn- ing embers as they fell in advance of the fire, which had already lighted up the whole district, and was sweeping all be- fore it into utter nothingness. But what   general could outgeneral the great po- tentate of the elements? Little fires were breaking out everywhere. There was a confusion of flame and smoke near the ground; while tall buildings, like islands of living fire, stood up, sending out their skirmishing parties to almost incredible distances. The firemen wero baffled, because they never could reach the outskirts of the fire. Every time they movyd back, and took a fresh po- sition, the fire went over their heaods and flanked them. Meanwhile Dr. Gildorslcove was witl the city authorities, counselling ;n matters of the gravest moment. In less than three hours over twenty blocks of buildings had been laid so low that no landmnarksy save a few stunted chimneys, were left to tell where they once had been. The fire had spread more than a mile from its original starting-point, and was mak- ing straight for the heart of tie city. Prompt measures for the transportation of gunpowder, and the blowing up of buildings, was the result of a collision between quick, decisive minds, and the work was not for an instant delayed. The fire-bells clanged and clamored, and the church-bells put in their dis- cordant tones. People ran into the streets to see, then through the streets without object or aim. nome ran be- cause others ran, and somd stood look- ing up into the red heavens, which also seemed on fire. The clouds, driven past by the gale, were like masses of angry flame-bearers of destruction. And still the fire kept on, coiling itself round building after building, like a venomous serpent greedy of its prey. Great lun- ber-yards disappeared like dissolving-  &#xD;<pb n="148" xml:id="VAC7037-00000077"/> views, and the freight-depots of the Chi- cago and St. Louis, the Pittsburg and Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroads, were swept of every vestige of an outline. Don't let it cross the river Hwork my brave boys l-turn the bridges I Ha I they are on fire already, as they stand there in the middle of the stream point- ing up and down. But, don't let it catch on the other shore-work! Steady at the helml Put out the firebrands as they fall-work, I say! The demon is reaching over, and trying to thwart your efforts-he is throwing missiles into dan- gerous places. There - see l-he has got foothold The wooden buildings ad- joining the gas-works are blazing. Oh, oh, oh HThe gas-house itself has gone, and the great city is lighted only by the fires with which it is being consumed I People ran madly, crowds meeting crowds, and each in their fright trying to push their way through each, and m'ny were trampled to death in the desperation of the moment. The ves- sels in the river took fire one alter an- other in quick succession, the masts and spars falling like rain-drops in a shower, while, at the-same time, the fire streamed along eastward, swallowed the great Michigan Southern Railroad depot, and innumerable blocks of large and small buildings around it, and the body of flame presented a front of half a semi- circle, behind which was a crackling, raging, roaring hell of half a mile in depth. Nothing material could stand the surge of this tremendous sea. The panic-stricken and distracted mob were almost as terrible to behold as the roar- ing conflagration. They ran toward Lake and South Water Streets, and upon the   bridges, and then turned at bay like affrighted animals. When Leonardus saw that the ocean of flame was irresistibly whelming every thing, and all reliance upon human suc- cor was over, he hurried to the Sherman House to assist Dr. Gildersleeve in mnov- ing his helpless ones to the north side, not thinking even then that we were doomed.  They met on the stairs and ran up together, encountering as they did so the hotel guests running down in every stage of dress and undress, and dragging trunks after them. Dr. Gil- dersleeve found Mrs. Hortense paralyzed with fright, and the nurse and his wife both gone! Mrs. Hortenso could give very little account of what had hap- pened. Helen had risen up and walked to the window, when she had not taken a step for years before, and, without speaking a word, had rushed from the room. The nurse had followed her, and neither of them had returned. Mis. Hortense did not think that Helen could have possibly got out of the house, for, even if any unnatural strength had come to her in the terror and excitement of the moment, it would not be likely to have carried her far. Dr. Gildersleevo hastened to explore the hotel, while Leo- nardus assisted Mrs. Hortense to get a few garments wrapped about her pre- paratory to leaving. Dr. Gildersleeve ran back to say: "Dear general, can you take care qf Mrs. Hortense? I think I have got trace of Helen," and was gone. Mrs. Hortense could not walk, and Leonardus lifted her in his arms. He did not dream the danger was so near. As he was passing out of the door, a  &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-149" xml:id="VAC7037-00000078"/> lighted piece of flooring, about the size of a butler's tray, was hurled through the window into the room just vacated, and the hotel was speedily hissing from every crack and corner. Down the stairs he flew with his burden, out the door, tried to stop a hack, hailed a flying om- nibus, yelled to the driver of a one-horse dray, loaded with men and women; saw no way but to run, and kept running. A wreath of fire rushed up Clark Street after him. He thought the pavements were on fire, but he learned afterward that they were all intact. Iie reached Lake Street, could see that Clark-Street bridge, was turned or broken, and "made for State-Street bridge; but great fiery balls were rushing through the sky, lighting up roofs and cornices a full half-mile in advance. Good HeavensI! -he discov- ered fires on the north side, and all around, and near State-Street bridge. Fearing he should be cut off in that di- rection, he turned westward, hoping to * get through La-Salle-Street tunnel. The stampede was sickening. Men and horses were jammed into each other, women and children bruised and bleeding, and, with clothes nearly torn from  their bodies, were screaming and moaning. All distinctions of class or nationality were lost; every life was dear to its possessor. Lake Street, with its long mile of glitter and show and costly ware- houses, and wealth -of goods, was in the jaws of the hungry monster. The flames were already overlapping South Water Street, the great wholesale centre, where seven-storied mines of riches stretched over another mile. What could a man, however strong and powerful physically, do with a helpless, groaning woman in   his arms? Should he push into that feafo ful hole underground? If he had been alone he would not have stopped to ques- tion, but could his burden ever be taken through alive? l-o made tleo attempt. There were no policemen to clear the way; every man must do his own push- 'ing. Policemen had homes and wives and children, like other men. They had run to savo them, too, like other men. But how was this knot of subterranean misery ever to be extricated? Loonar- dus saw one man trying to drag three little children through in a garbage-bar- rel. They were pinned fast against the wall by entangled humanity. The air was like a furnace seven times heated. he was losing time; he had been losing time ever since lie started from the Sher- man House. One great, mighty effort, and lie crossed Wells-Street bridge. He never could remember how it was ac- complished. It seemed as if hl had been lifted upon the human wave, and tossed  over. And then lie made for Kinzio- Street bridge, to get Mrs. Hortenso into some secure place to windward of the flames. Fighting against the whirlwind of ashes and smoke, ie at last reached the west side, dropped Mrs. Hortenso at the first respectable house lie could find, and scarcely had turned to fly to our re- lief, when he blundered upon Richard, and Mrs. Vance's carriage, and learned how he had tried to got back for his mis- tress and found it impossible. Spicy, in her elegant mansion, on Michigan Avenue, was alone with her three little children and three servants. She had retired at her usual hour, and slept peacefully until awakened some- time after midnight by her husband's  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7037-00000079"/> book-keeper from the office, who told her what frightful progress the fire was making, and inquired if he had better un- lock the safe and take out the contents. "Certainly," replied Spicy; "I will go and do it iyself." "You  Oh, no " an' he remon- strated ith great earnest4nss. But se had not asked for advice, nor would she have been likely to have asked it of him, a mere boy, in Wr estimation. She dressed quickly, and ano t he barn herself to order her coachmiato harness the horses, and' bring the round to the door without a moment's dtlai. He was astonished, stared in the direction of the horrible fire, and declared he could not drive her gay team on such a night. "Do as I bid you," iwiall she said, and ran back to the hos to complete her arrangements. Her cook was her mnst reliable ser- vant, and it was she who was com- manded to get readl to accompany the brave woman. The book-keeper might do as he liked, go or not go if he went, it must be under her guidance. Ho sprang into the carriage ivt' h her, and they were whirled raipiy toward the scene of destruction.  "We cannot get any4    oier on Mad- ison Street," called the jriver down through the glass, stoppin his horses at the corner of State. 'Drive on l" fell firmly from the lips of the ittle woman behind him, and he obeyed.: Down into Madison Street, amid the deafening roar of the furies, and the ceaseless thud of falling walls I -the horses, meanwhile, neighing in mortal terror, striking the pavements wildly '* ,     .          *c ^   with their hoofs, and foam falling from their mouths in showers. Spicy sat erect and motionless as a statue of mar- ble, not blind to the danger, not un- moved by what she saw and heard, but with one sole purpose in view, and spirit enough to put it in execution. The heat was so intense that their progress was not retarded by frenzied fugitives. The large buildings on the south side of Mad- ison Street had already taken fire; a few daring men only ran along the sidewalk at intervals, and paused to scream into the carriage: "You are a fool, madam! Back out of here " In front of her husband's office Spicy sprang from the carriage pulling the 'af- ghan after her, ran up the stairs, followed by Nora and the book-keeper, and in a twinkling the ponderous door of the im- mense safe swung open and a portion of the contents were hastily piled upon the carriage-robe, and the three caught hold of it and conveyed it to -the carriage. The coachman was holding the terrified horses by the heads, and there was dan- ger of their breaking away from him. "Hire any one who comes along to help you hold them, and I will pay him his price," said Spicy, looking up at the bridge of fire over her, measuring her moments, and maki'g a second trip to the office. When they brought down their next cargo of books and ledgers in the car- riage-robe, six men were hanging at the horses' heads. "We shall all burn-the carriage will burn!" shouted the coachman. "Take it to the corner of State Street, and I will meet. you there," said Spicy. \   "Don't go up again, madam " yelled several voices, all in one breath. But she had gone, and the awe- stricken servant and book-keeper had followed her. It was the last time the carriage-robe was filled, and the three bore it to the corner of State Street, where they found the carriage, but with this last accession it was so full that Spicy could not get in herself. She paid the men ten dollars each who had helped to hold her horses, and then sent the driver with the valu- ables to the house of a friend in the ex- treme southern portion of the city. She did not think her own house was going to burn, but it was-better that what she had /saved should be elsewhere taken care of. Then she started on her walk home. Wabash Avenue was a dense mass of human beings. Ilackmen wero the mon- arcls of the occasion, and were driving furiously without regard to life and limb, gentle breeding, tender sex, or the inore potent influence of the star of the order of the guardians of public safety. There were none of the white-gloved gentry at the street-corners to help her over; but she reached the other side in safety, thanks to a kind, protecting Providence, and ran against Miss Terrapin. She was surprised, that is, if such a tame emotion as surprise could be mentioned with such scenes. Miss Terrapin was laden with bundles and a basket, lad- started for Spicy's house, frightened from her rooms on Lake Street by the near approach of the fire. They went on togethe walk- ing fast and speaking rapidly, and, when about half-way between Wabash and Michigan Avenues, both came near stum-   bling over a lady who had fallen upon her face upon the sidewalk. "Poor thing!" said Spicy, stopping to raise her. Miss Terrapin handed her bundles to Nora, and took hold of the other arm of the lady, and, assisting herself a little, she came to her feet. But she sank backward directly, and would have fallen again, had they not together caught her in their arms. IIcr face now was toward the west, and the crimson glare lit up every feature. Spicy and Miss Terrapin looked at each other at the same instant with a flash of intelligenco and recog-  nition mingled with horror. It was thh same that had looked at them eight years before, from the closet of the blue-room in the old Dwight mansion! It was a face that could not be for- gotten. It was thin and emaciated then, it was thinner and more emaciated now, but still the samne. the hair was dark and long then, it was white and short now, but the contour of that high, strange forehcad remained, and impressed the mind just the same as beforo. the eyes emitted the same vivid lightnings, and the hands, which clung to their arms, were but too easily identified. "My ghost -after all these years," said Spicy, with compassion instead of fear in her voice. The eyes came near consuming her, and then a harsh, hoarse response: "You stole my letters I " Miss Terrapin trembled, and would have dropped the woman but for Spicy's hold on ler. The book-keeper lad lent his slight strength to save her from fall ing, also, when he saw the two were unequal to the task.  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7037-00000080"/> "Who are you?" asked Spicy. "Those were my letters, and you 'stole them and read them," Bhe said again. "What is your name?  persisted Spicy. "Queen Dido!" and a maniacal laugh rang ott above the awful sounds with which the air was filled. "What do your friends call you?" Spicy was unruffled, but determined. "I have no friends. I am going to the water over there; it is boiling-don't you see it?-^-I am going to take a warm bath,' and she laughed again. "What shall I call you? Lucy? or Maria? or Jane?" and Spicy's voice was entreating. "I am not going to tell you. You stole my letters!-I wanted them, and you wouldn't let me have them. They were my Grandison's letters, and I loved him and every scrap of paler. ho ever laid his hand upon. Let me go. I am thirsty-I want water. Do you see that chariot of fire?" "I know her-it is my sister Helen  Help me; we must try to carry her home," said Spicy. "I your sister Helen; I thought I was your ghost!" screamed the maniac. "Your husband is Rev. Dr. Grandison Gildersleeve -isn't he?"Spicy asked, quietly, "and I am his brother Fred's wife." "What business have you to speak 'his name?. You stole my letters! -I went for themland you called me a ghost. But I wanted them, they were my letters." "How did you,get into that closet?" asked Spicy. "Through the little window. It had   a slide, and you could not find it. I wanted the letters! I loved Grandison. I knew it was wrong to marry him, but you shall not accuse me. You stole my letters I I knew I was going to be a crazy wife. My father was crazy before me, but we never .told him. I had been in an asylum twice, but we kept the secret-mother and Hbecause I loved him, and mother said he would forgive me. He has forgiven me so grandly, that my conscience has set the world on fire. When I am once in the water it will be put out-let me go!" She struggled to free herself, but. she had little strength, and they succeeded in carrying her to the corner of Michigan Avenue. The street was packed with people, like all the other streets, and painfully illumined. It was easy, there- fore, for them to distinguish Mrs. Vancc's carriage as it picked its way along, and for Mrs. Vance to recognize. Spicy and Miss Terrapin on the sidewalk. She drew up immediately and got out, for the din was too great for her to talk with them from the window of her car- riage. A few brief explanations from Spicy, aided by her ready intelligence, and the whole immediate difficulty was mastered.         That part of Michigan Avenue where they both lived might not burn. It hardly seemed probable, with the wind in the present direction, that it would. But it was best to be prepared. Mrs. Vance was taking her sick aunt Mary over to General Belmore's for quiet, as f well as safety, and was then coming back herself to await results. She thought Mrs. Gildersleeve had better be removed there also. But, as she had improvised   a sort of bed in the carriage, she thought it would hardly bo best to disturb Aunt Mary by trying to force the wretched lunatic in against her will, so proposed to stay with her herself until the car- riage should return. "You know your sister t[eddie will do every thing for Aunt Mary if I am not with her, and I will take this poor lady there myself," she said. "Miss Terrapin, you will stay with Mrs. Vance, I am sure; we will take all your things and take care of them," said Spicy. She signified her assent, and Mrs. Vance begged of Spicy to hurry to her darling babies, and make it her first busi- ness to transport them to some other portion of the city. After waiting a few mionlInts where they were, and finding their burden sink- ing. heavily, Mrs. Vance asked Miss Ter- rapin to go to her house and bring one of the light easy-chairs from her library. They placed Mrs. Gilderslcevo in it, and dragged her gently along toward Rush- Street bridge, watching eagerly for the carriage, which they momentarily ex- pected. But, as they advanced north- ward, they came more directly into the vein of the fire-tempest. They did not progress fast, for it was with agonizing delays, and at the risk of their lives, that they could cross the side-streets, which were pouring their overwhelming num- bers upon Michigan Avenue. The car- riage must come soon! Before they were aware of the possibility of such a thing, they were hemmed in by the frightened multitudes who were being driven tow- ard Rush-Street bridge. For, suddenly, a great, expanding scythe of flame was   reaching over and around anid'beyond them, mowing immense and increasing swaths with alarming rapidity, and now and then sending columns of smoko and blaze hundreds of feet into the air, like solid and perpendicular shafts of molten metal. The mighty rush toward th north side had set in, and they could no more turn back. They were launched forth on a journey, th extent or the end of which defied the power of human calculations. Spicy commenced packing as soon as she got home. And yet she did not be- lievo her house was going to burn. When her carringo returned, sho sent her chil- dren, with their nurse, to tleo house of tile same friend who had just received her possessions from the offico. Tilo next thing was to try to open a safe, which stood in a recess at the end of tloe ' front-hall. It was a combination lock, and she could not remember the number. She knew it, but in the excitement it had gone from her. She spent some tiino over it, and finally sent tioe book-keeper to the telegraph-office to get a messago to her husband in Now York, asking for tle simple figure, but he found the luild- ing roaring like an .army of lions, and, after spending an hlour or two in a vain effort to find to what point the appa- ratus had been r moved, retutned un- successful. '  Meanwhile the carriage returned af- ter the safe deposit of the little ones, and sle filled it with paintings and books and silver, and sent it forth agalin; but it came back to her no more. They wero preparing to blow up buildings oni the avenue below, for the fire had swooped round, and was sweeping all before it  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7037-00000081"/> now toward the south, and vehicles were not allowed to come up from tiat direc- tion. Adieu to hope, and all fancied security; Spicy's beautiful home must go! That safe Hif she could only get it open. - Impossible; but if she could get it to the front-door, and roll it down the steps, it would not melt when the build- ing should come to fall. She stopped so  e men who were passing. Yes, they whld do it for fifty dollars. ,The city was burning, and they must have their pay in advance. Spicy paid them. They worked at the safe for a few minutes, pulled it an inch or two, swore at Spicy for having made them- try to kill them- selves, and then went away I She lired a wagon to carry a load of furniture. Twenty-five dollars the man   asked. Money first, furniture afterward. Spicy gave him the required suln IHer elegant parlor suite "Was put uplon the wagon, but just then a man came running and offered the driver fifty dollars to take a load for him. Off went the goods upon the sidewalk, and away went the wagon. Spicy set to work at once with what help she could muster, and carried her treas- ures across the avenue upon the lake shore.   It was a perilous undertaking, for every kind of vehicle was jammed in there. the fire, too, was close at hand.  It had lapped up the Clifton and the Palmer House, as well as miles and miles'of other magnificent buildings, and was whirling i nrat lurid eddies aroundi the block justr above.  Spicy had suc- ceeded in getting out many things; most of her carpets were on the water's edge, also bundles of clothing -- she had re- jected trunks as being too cumbersome-   beds, books, and crockery. She was running from a chamber with an armful of her husband's apparel, and was about to give it to Nora to convey across the street, when three or four vicious-look- ing men entered, and deliberately took the things from her and commenced try- ing on coats, vests, etc. She observed them for a moment quietly, then, with no apparent agitation, said: j  ' You are welcome to those clothes. I don't suppose I can save theim. But I (do protest against the way in which you are appropriating them." They looked confounded, and   one :aftor another sneaked away with their booty. The last was a bloated Irishman, and, as lie turned to look at Spicy tho second time, shoe recognized our old moving man of May, 1862, and the sub- sequent robber. O1h, that safe! It was Snicy's last tie. If sho could only get it rolled out. The house was already on fire in the rear. What should she (o? Must it bo left to its certain fate?  A! quick, rapid jstep through the hall, heard above the tuirmoil of the elements. She turned:  "0h, brother Grandison I " "My child! you must leave this place instantly. Is there a last thing I can do for you?"  'This safe, if it could only be rolled out the front door.! It does seem as if it might be 'done." He caught hold 'of it; it moved. Spicy caught hold with alim-a flv might as well have lent its aid. The book-keeper applied all hlls eneigies; he never knoew befo 'e that lhe lad so manv. Nora pulled a  few scattered articles out of the way,   and then got in the way herself. Brid. get screamed: "Hurry, hurry H-tho house is falling!"She had felt the hall- floor settle, for the safe was under way --it was almost to the door. Another push, another pull-another, and still another strain of strong arms and strong- or wills--there, it is at the threshold!- it is over! Crash, crash, crash I It has taken the ]andsnomo stone steps with it; but what of that,ifit cannot melt now I Fred Gildersleevels fortune is saved-- and it has been sated by his wife! But the fire, tio merciless fire, had closed in upon them. Dr. Gildersleeve leaped over the ruins of the steps, and helped Spicy down.   the others fol- lowed, but whither should they fly? They seemed to be enveloped in a sort of reverberatory furnace, like that em- ployed to met metallic ores. There was fire to the rigrht of theom, there was fire to the left of rhem, there was fire behind thell, and there was fire over their heads. The torrid ]leafs, and the lurid lights, had blotted out the sky.  Tllero was nothing left them but the lake. They ran down to its vcry edge. Dr. Gilder- sleeve, with teho aid of the book-keeper, dipped one of the carpets into the water, and spread it over Spicy and her women; but, one blast oflthIat raging sirocco, and it was dry and s'orched like an ironing- sheet. He jumped into'the water him- self to extinguish thlo little fires whichl had caught in hip shirt-bosom, and hair, and neock, and ito. prevent the heavy cloth of which his clothes were made from kindling. The book-keeper, blinded and frantic, jumped in also; but, while Dr. Gildersleeve sprang back on shore, and seized the dtawer of a cabinet;--the   first thing that came  in his way-and dipped and threw water with all his might and main to keep the carpet wet, the young man, being a fair swimmer,ln , worked his way along in the water and made his escape at Harrison Street. Imagine, if you can, the most blind- ing snow-storm that ever was known, and the snow not snow but fireo! Ihn- agine yourself trying to breathe in it on a narrow point botween an angry blazo -an ocoean of blaze, I might say-fandl a nmurky sea. And oven. then you will only vaguely reotlizo what Dr. Gilder- sleevo encountered in his hand-to-lhand fight with the powers of thlo air. Re- peating his own  bathis every other moment, and throwing water upon the carpets with the despeoration of a mad- lman, lie wore away the timeo until tlohe hugeo walls near by lnad toppled to tho ground, and the waves of death hiad rolled on. Spicy had saved a folrt-un e- Dr. Gildersleeve had averted the still greater calamity, loss of life. There was rest; but such rest! Fierceo fires in every directionl. Eyes blisteredl and blinded and stinging, and smlloke nnd ashes enveloping them like a cloud. Dr. Gildersleeve sat down and looked  it: Spicy, who had withstood so much  and so courageously.   She was exhausted, half suffocated, but not overpowered. "I am so glad Fred was not here," was her first remark. "Why?" asked Dr. Gildersleeve. "Because he would have been killed in trying to help everybody," she said. Dr. Gilderslccve smiled. "He would have kept his wife out of danger if he could, I fancy; but where are your children?"  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7037-00000082"/> "Safe, unless the fire never stops.' And Spicy gave him a history of her night. "Poor HelenI how I thank you for your kindness to her! How fortunate that your friend was just in time to take her away in a carriage, beyond the reach of danger! But the fire is raging on the north side; they will have to flee miles, I fear." "Brother Grandison, did you ever board in the old Dwight mansion; that odd little cottage which once stood on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Mad- ison Street?" "Yes, for a few weeks in the spring of 1862. We went frolm there to the Clifton, just back of it, on the corner of Wabash Avenue and Madison Street. Why?" Spicy told him the ghost-story, and Helen's recent allusions to the letters, withholding the fact, ho-wever, that shel had ever seen and read the docu- ments. "Now I understand to what Helen referred, when slihe persisted in talking about her lost letters. I supposed it part and parcel of her disordered fancy. I missed her several times late in the evening, and once or twice at midnight, and was obliged to put, extra bolts upon my doors.  And you recognized each other-how singular I " "Don't you think we can get down the avenue by this time? I must go to my children." "Not, my child, while Terrace block is burning. Look, look!-it is going over. Every thing is on a pretty gen- eral level now. Be patient, little one, we cannot help ourselves yet." And   then he went on and told her of his search for Helen, after she had escaped frim her mother at the hotel. Some one in the office had noticed her as she passed by, so that he knew that she was in the street. She had on a dressing- gown of blue silk, which she usually wore in bed, and he hoped to distinguish her easily. He was confident that herl strength would not carry her far, but, from various attempts which she had made to burn herself in the past, lie searched for her in the direction of the fire. He believed she would approach it until prostrated by the lhat. He groped along the red-hot pavements, peered into every dark corner through all the multitudinous streets and alleys, and only moved' backward as he was driven by the fire-fiend. Passing along Dearborn Street, he ran against an old man, who was standing by a broad- paned window looking in upon a rare and valuable collection of paintings, the accumulation of lmany years of patient toil. IIoe was groaning, as if in anguish of spirit. "What is the matter, my good sir?" "Have you a key?-oh, sir, have you a key that you think will fit this door? I have left mine in the pocket of my week-day pantaloons at my home over on the west side, and it will take me better than an hour to get it here. The building may burn before that timne, and, oh, it is my all!" 1 Those  pictures are yours-are they?" "Yes, indeed, and the finest stock in the city. What shall I do?" "Break through the glass, and take them  out!--or yonder messenger will   break the glass for you, and wind up your business at the same time."' The man's face brightened. Hoe had not thought of such a rude way of en- tering the building. A few moments later Dr. Gildersloevo passed that way again, and saw him piling his pictures upon an express-wagon. CHIAPTEPR XX. MRS. VANCEIS FOUR-MLE FLIGHT. AND what of Mrs. Vanco and Miss Terrapin, and their unfortunate charge? 'They had crossed Rush-Street bridge, borno along by the billows of thlat hid- eous, howling mob.  They h11d Veon trampled, jo3tled, jammed. The bridge had turned while they were upon it, to let a schooner into the lake, and they had been overrun by the mad attempts of the multitude to jump upon her decks. Clinging to cach other, and to the frame- work of the bridge, they had seen more than one person go down to a watery grave. Helen Gilderslceve had there made a frantic effort to free herself fromn her captors, and reach the coveted wa- ters. Once she had nearly succeeded, and but for Mrs. Vance's wonderful presence of Imind in interposing lher arm, and grasping the shoulder of a little girl in the crowd just beyond, she would - have been lost to them forever. "Oh, ma'am, don't pinch 1le; you'll make me drop my birdiel " implored the little one, who was clinging fast to a precious cage. Mrs. Vance reassured her, and just then a- full-sized man jerked the chair   from under the invalid, strikillng Miss Terrapin, who was bonding over her, in the head with such force as to blind her for a few moments, and send her bonnet and wig spinning over the railing out of sight. The man wanted theo clhair to drag a lady in himself,; but the little girl was indignant, and with her free hand seized himn by the coat-tail, and a brawny negro, whom she called John, wrenched it away from its purloiner and restored it to Mrs. Vahce. A great firebrand fdl in the middle of the bridrge upon 1a white- haired man, whlo was being drawn by two woleln oil a billiard-bolrd, witil his hlead downwaf'd. Then anothoher fell in acart, which contained some combus- tible material, and a bright blaze shot up' all about them. the scene was terrific. There were so many vessels and tugs trying to got thlough, that it seemed as if the bridge never would close. It did at last, and was left burning behind them. Buildings were burning everywhere on the north side too. Tllhey ran, llotly Ipr'- sued ; they )paused, took breath, tand thlle ran again. People ran by them, lclaped over thmci, struck them witil trunks and pieces of furniture in Ipasing. Tlcy could not get on as fast ias, others, be- cause of their heavy burden. They were driven from square to square, along thlose miles and miles of interminable streets and avenues, always dragging the help- less lunatic in the cliair. Hour after hour, and still the relentless fire ch:asd, hissed in their ecars , ..rd spit horridly suggestive cinders upon thelir heads anld necks. Mrs. Vanlce had thrown a water-proof around her when she started out in the night, and it proved lher salvation. It  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7037-00000083"/> not only saved her from getting on fire innumerable times, but it was the means by which she extinguished the flames which were constantly lighting the cloth- ing of Miss Terrapin and Helen Gilder- sleeve. That great, hateful, fiery-looking hlball in the heaves, which kept getting higher and highi., and which could be seen as the clouds of smoke cleared at intervals, telegraphed that it was mid- day. Then the day was waning, but not the fire. On, on it came, with a fury that is beyond the power of language. And on, on ran the two wo eC, dragging the other woman in the chair. Once they took refuge in a cemetery. But the fire found them, and drove them  on." The n:arble over the  graves cracked and baked,-and fell in glowing embers on the hot turf. Every inscription was ob- literated, wherever the skeleton of a tombstone was left. The great receiv- -ing-vault, solidly built and shrouded with foliage, was attacked, and the dead bodies burst from  their coffins as the fire tore through the walls. What a day to remember! And each participant in that chapter of miseries has a story to tell, which will thrill their children's and their children's children's hearts to the remotest generation I IMay history never have such another to record! No rest, no peace until they were hidden within the confines of Lincoln Park, without food, and the stars and the fire-clouds their only shelter. Mrs. Vance dropped on her knees, and thanked God for. having brought them through so i many dangers.  Then she stroked the i forehead devoid of mind, and tenderly I kissed it.   The tumult and the roar had givern place to a terrible silence. Seventy thousand people were huddled together. The delicate woman, the high-bred dame, the haughty banker, the revered cler- gyman, the tender infant, the hardy la- borer, and the worst denizens of the worst localities. Now and then the air was rent with moans. Children cried for bread sometimes; but, exhaustion had absorbed fear, and many slept. Over others the settled quiet of deep, dull de- spair reigned supreme. They looked at each other as if their minds were far away.  Some covered' their faces and wept.   % As the night air cooled and then chilled them, Mrs. Vance wound her water-proof about Mrs. Gildersleevc. That easy-chair had proved a faithful friend. It had worn out its legs in the service of its mistress, had come apart in the back, and its cushions were riddled as with bullets. But it was far better than the wet earth for an invalid. Mrs. Gilderslceve slept, while Mrs. Vance and Miss Terrapin watched. It was a quiet, marvellous sleep for one who had been raving all day. If they could only get her some food I An old market-woman canme along munching some cake, and sat down on the ground near them. "O Can you give me a little, just a crumb, for this sick lady here?" asked Mrs. Vance. She had a compassionate face, that baked, fire-scarred woman; that is, a compassionate heart shone from it, and she put her hand in a dirty bag, which hung by her side, and produced a hand- ful of crackers and gave Mrs. Vance,   who could hardly repress her tears of gratitude. "I have no money here, but tell me your name, and I will solme dlay reward you," she said. "She is a very rich lady," Miss Ter- rapin remarked to the woman. Ah! she had beeon a rich lady, but where were her riches now? Helen Gildersleeve opened her eyes after a wlile, and Mrs. Vanco tried to induce her to taste a cracker. She shook her head, and kept her mouth closed firm; she looled around as if sho could not comprehend the weird, strange scene, the red glare cityward, the dark heavens above. Presently it began to rain. Mrs. Vance drew the hood of the water-proof down to shield the invalid's face, but she pushed it away. "Where are we-what is all this?" she asked. Mrs. VYance explained as well as she was able, and the hot, hollow  eyes seemed to burn out the darkness be- tween them, and turn into fire as they were fixed on her. , And who are you?--an angel froln heaven?" she asked, after having lis- tened quietly foro some time, "Oh, no! A child of this world, very human and'very hungry," w-as the reply. "And yet you eat nothing, and try to put crackers in my mouth.  I don't want them. I can't live if I do eat; I have never lived; I have only been a torment to every one whom I have best loved. Bring your face down nearer, I want to see your blue eyes. Grandison loved a ladyv once who had blue eyes- they must have been like yours.  She   married another man.   Sllhe was the cause of all his misery, else lie would not have taken me an(i been cursed. Will you call Grandison?-- I aml dying, and I want him! lie has been so kind; never a word nor a look of replroach all these long years. I nmust tell lhim how I deceived hinm!--I cannot die without telling him. It was because I loved him --I had no pity in mly heart, it was all love--and now it lhas kindled a hell in the middle of a city!  I light have known it would."  She had exhausted herself, mnl fell back listlessly, withl closed eyes. iMrs. Vance changed the position of the chair, so that on liher knees sho could suDport the feeble head, and thul s mllanged with her uplifted armn to shield the paloe faico with the hood of tleo water-proof. "Do you think she is dying,?" whis- pered Miss Terrapin, excitedl1y. "I fear so.-and yet, who ctan tell? Let her sleep, it may revive lher." There were groups of people near them. There was one man whlo walked up and down, like a sentinel on duty. His hicad rested upon his breast, and sometimes lie counted aloud.  Once or twice vords like dividend and hit r'(nct1e fell upon the night air. Ilo wore no h'at, and the rain pattered upon his lolead. He kept up the steady tramp for hours, r swaying to the right and left in his gait sometimes. At last lie blundered against I Miss Terrapin, who was on her knees lby , Mrs. Vance. The accident recalled lim t-to himself, and lie apologized. ]rTlS. I Vance looked up, and lie looked down into her eyes, bent lower and lower, as if doubting his own senses. "'Ah! Dr. Greer," said she.  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7037-00000084"/> He straightened himself immediately. "I little thought of meeting you here," came sadly from his lips. His voice aroused Mrs. Gilderslceve. "Is it Grandison?"  "No; but it is a friend," said Mrs. Vance, soothingly. "Will he go for Grandison?-ask him." "To whom does she refer?" inquired Dr. Greer. "Rav; Dr. Gildersleeve. Do you know him?" inquired Mrs. Vance. "Know himn!--ask a Chcago man if he knows Dr. Gildersleeve I Do I know there has been a fire? Excuse me, madam; yes, I do know him, and I honor and respect him, too, more than almost any other man whom it has been my lot to know in Chicago." "This sick lady here is his wife," * said Mrs. Vance. "Is it possible!" Dr. Greer regarded her sadly. "She is very low, and, as you were once a physician, perhaps you can in- struct us how to make the most of our slender resources for her comfort. A cup of tea, some slight nourishment, or a tonic, seems imperative." "Notling-call Grandison! ' whis- pered the invalid. But Dr. Greer had taken a tonic which roused him to action. The voice of the woman, whoml he loved and ad- mired above all others, had put mettle into his bones, and he was prepared to do her bidding. He forgot his stocks and profits and losses, and remembered that somewhere over toward the lake he had seen a woman trying to make a tea- kettle boil over embers from the burning   city. Away he ran as fast as his short legs could carry him, spreading himself, however, at full length over some snor- ing sleepers before he had accomplished a dozen rods in his haste and the dark- ness. But he was agile as if sixteen, in- stead of sixty, and was up and on. He ran against a little girl with such force that he knocked her down, and, stooping to help her up, was hindered by her de- spairing clutch. "Oh, tell me whllere papa and rnma- ma are!" All kinds of household goods were on the ground; they were tumbled about everywhere. Dr. Greer was impatient with the many obstacles in the way of his progress. A man, stooping to min- ister to some sufferer, he leaped directly over, having gained so much momentum before seeing him that he could not stop. On, on to the destined point. Yes, the woman had a little hot wa- ter; her old man had brought it all the way from the lake. She had been mak- ing tea. Wouldn't give him a drop, not she. "Folks must take care of their- selves, and bring their own tea!"IHow could sho feed all the rich folks and thecir grand ladies? She was good as the aristocrats, now-; they would know how- it felt to boe poor, she guessed. What was that she saw?--a five-dollar billl Was the gentleman really offering her a five-dollar bill for a cup of tea? "Take it, Janey!" whispered the owner of a pair of covetous eyes, in the darkness behind her. "Well, yes; I don't mind accommodat- ing, but I can't throw the cup in. I didn't save but two or three, and cups will be high now there's been so many burned.   No, wouldn't trust you to bring it back; don't know who is honest or who ain't. Two dollars!-is that it? I can't see very well. Never mind about the cup, I al- ways like to dlo favors!" and, with seven dollars less in his pocket, Dr. Grcer steadied a dingy cup of villanous-look- ing dark fluid in his hand, as he picked his uncertain and rainy way back to the ladies. Mrs. Vnance used every effort to persuade -Mrs. Gildersleeve to sip even one swallow, but in vain. - Then Dr. Grecr, with a grim smile, declared that the nurses -should obey him if thie pa- tient would not; and Mrs. Vance and Miss Terrapin, with their crackers to help choke it down, ldivided the horrid stuff between them. M[eanwhile Dr. Grccr blorrow-ced some bcd-blankets from a pile of goods, whichh was guarded by a small boy fnst asleep, and the ladies were wrapped up and in a nmeasure protected from the storm. Helen Gilderslecvo was again slumber- ing. How they all prayed for the 'day to dawn! Dr. Grecr felt bler pulse, and shook his head. What could bo done? Where go for help, when there was no help? The city was bulned! The rain came ftster, and lie tool off hills coat and held it over Mrs. Vance. She -forbade his doing so, and lie put his coat on again with a sigh. Then the rain subsided, and a heavy mist settled over them. Mrs. Gildersleeve stru,'ggled, and begged for air. Dr. Greer assisted )Mrs. Vance in raising her partially, but the movement distressed her, and they were obliged to lay her back again. All at once sihe opened hefryes, and the light of reason seemed to spring frioin them. "I am dying, and Grandison is not "   hlero!-tell him how 1 wanted him! Oh, if I could but hear his voice in prayer once more! I used to mock lim welill lie prayed, and I drove himn fronm his church and people I Will you ask him if hlo truly forgalve ne?-and say I loved hilm, will you? WA'lo, oh, who will pray for me? Will you?"And her quick, inquir- ing gaze was riveted upon Mrs. Vance's face, a face wan and worn just then, bult, fobr all of youth's lost bloom, a face full of beauty which -cars could not ruin. "Dear one, I will," -was the touching And such a prayer as welled from her lips has rarely ever been heard. The suffirer listened like one afraid of losing jewels beyond price. She was graspling Mrs. Vance's hand, all pressing it to her heart. the strong mana  dropped on his knee; he had been a praying man all his life, but prayer was unfolding a new imeaning to ]liml now. Whlen we aro strong and well, land the needs of 'life colme freely tat our bidding, and we !lie down to sleepl in the full assurance of a peaceful and fortunato morrow, the tongue is apt to syllablle its sUlpplic'ltions very glibly, a1nd it is easy to fmncy ia per- fect measure of trust and confidence in tlohe Fatler of all mercies. But whelln we aro shut in as with a chspingr-knito from every thing dear, it is no idle faith if suf- ficient to bear the test. It was a solemn and strangely-impressive scene--the oc- casion, the circumstances, the hour, the stillness, and the low, clear, steady voice, which was leading all present into ia nearer, tenderer rclation withll the Ruler of events. Tlere wero tears coursing down cheeks unused to tears, and there were choking sobs back in the darkness,  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7037-00000085"/> for strangers had been creeping close to catch the words. "Thank you-God bless you; I am better now I "And Helen Gildersleeve never spoke afterward. She lay as if in a calm sleep, breathing fainter and fainter. Dr. Greer and Mrs. Vance watched every pulse-beat. Suddenly there was a pause -her spirit had taken its final flight. At about the same hour we had land- ed in a far-away prairie-farlner's home. But for Mrs. Chafferlee, Leonardus would have allowed us to remain on the road- side, as we begged of him  But the exposure was sapping the fountains of her life, and he made herculean exertions to reconstruct our equipage. At last we were once more on the higllway to shel- ter. I don't know how far we had pro- ceeded when Leonardus left his mule to adjust a spoke in the wheel, and the mule left us. I suppose he had got tired of such an unusual day's work, and con- cluded that his best friends were his worst enemies. At all events, he had freed himself firom his novel harness and disappeared. "Not imuch of a loss. I believe I can draw you myself!" said Leonardus. he was in earnest, and I jumped out. So- did Mrs. Huberjide and Maggie and Esther, and Mrs il Huberjide and Maggie volunteered to push the wagon from be- hind. We did not get on very fast, and the rain set in; but the greatw,awkward wagon-cover shielded Mrs. Chafferlee, and I did not mind for the rest. Esther wondered why nobody had thought to bring an umbrella! She was sure that every thing she had on would be spoiled. Leonardus told her he thought there would be time for hmr to run back and   get one, while we were travelling to the next statiop. He was bound to be cheer- ful, and his spirit was contagious. I laughed quite like myself, when panting and perspiring he halted and called out: "Five minutes for refreshments!" Esther did not see how grown-up women could go giggling along the road, after having had such a dreadful es- cape. Bright asked what made laughing wicked? Esther replied by muttering, "It is well enough for those whlo hain't got no feelings." "I'vb got feelings," said Bright; "I feel as if I should like to give my dog a bone." Mrs. Huberjide proposed to cliange placesxwith Leonardus, and let him push while she pulled. I took hold with her, and we had quite a lively run down a slight descent. Esther was left'in the lurch, and Leonardus made us wait for her to catch up. When she crame along- side he asked her to ride, and Mrs. Hu- berjido and I laughed again. We were not alone on that lone road. Wagons and stragglers passced us, but they took no notice of our primitive nlode of moving. Once, while we were rest- ing, Leonardus asked me wlhat I had saved in my bundle. Was it any thing which I could make available to throw around me to keep off the rain I had long since put my Astrakhan cloak on Mrs. Chanfferlee. I had forgotten, so we opened it. One dozen night-dresses, whichl had just been sent home from the seamstress, starched and ruffled and fluted, and that was all! Leonardus looked down at me with a very comical expression on his face.   "Speak it out; I know what you thinkl," I said. "Ah, wifey, let the wise vaunt their wisdom. We are spared to each other," and the exquisite joy conferred on me by -that little speech tingled to my fingers' ends. A story-and-a-half house greeted 'at last our, wearied vision. We all put our shoulders to the wheel, or, more strictly speaking, our hands to the wagon, ex- cept Esther, whlo declared that her fa- ther's daughter never should be made a pack-horse of. We were admitted, and Mrs. Chafferlee was tenderly cared for on a soft feather bed. We all dropped exhausted around her, on chairs, on the floor, anywhere. The good farnmer's wife kindled her kitchen-fire, to prepare us sonmething to eat. Leonardus brought the sticks that built the fire. What powers of endurance! He came to me after a few minutes: "Now, wifey, you must not borrow any trouble about me. You are safe for the present, and I am going, to the city to look after others who are not so well provided for." I sprang up in alarm. "What, when you have not had a mouthfull of food for thirty-six hours I " "I am not so forgetful of myself as that. I have been in the pantry, and blundered upon about a yard of cold roast beef.

Sleep and eat, and get freshened up as much as possible before I get back."   Since I could do nothing less than follow his directions, I will permit my readers to follow him. It was daylight when lie first camo upon the abomination of desolation. Six miles of ruin! Longitudinally seven or eight  Cellars were filled with smoul- dering and unsightly heonaps of rubll ish. The streets were encumbered with de- bris, the sidewalks had toumbled into the vaults, the th elegraph-wires, curled and whitened, lay everywhere, and the street- car rails were bent into the most eccen- tric shapes by the bleat. In llmany in- stances tley stood up out of the car- staples without any fire having touchcd them, theo effects of the intensely hleated air. In one place lio got off his liorso to examineo a car-wheel, wlich wans coim- pletely welded into the rail. the beau- tiful dwellings, fall through the length and breadth of North Chicago, were laid low, save one, which, .standing in tlio centre of its own grounds, covering a whole block, was left. Ila What is that he sees in that wild waste?

The leat had brought out the blossoms, and it was like one great, rich, full bouquet 1 What a sight amid slch surroundings TIo rode on. The bridges were gone, the elevators were gone, the churches were gone, the newspaper-of- fices were gone, the banks were gone, the hotels were gone, the great wholesale and retail stores were gone, the school-build- ings were gone, the custom-house was gone, the post-office was gone, the city hall was gone, the gas-works were gone,  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7037-00000086"/> the water-works were gone, and the rail- road-stations were gone. The whole of the great Central Depot might have been carried away in a hand-basket. As the growing of Chicago was the superlative of all modern history, so, alas I its destruction. The story of it has gone to the -ends of the earth, and has called forth everywhere tearful sympathy and generous aid.  Thank God for the chords which connect the members of our common humanity I The Gospel doctrine of charity lives in the hearts of all men. While Leonardus, on that sad morning, saw how brick and marble walls had crumbled like sand be- fore the fell destroyer, the importance of our new agents of civilization were being realized by millions of human be- ings. The railroads, the telegraph, and the deep-sea cables, were mediums by which Christian nations proved that they were indeed Christian to the core. In distant cities, in foreign lands, the tocsin had been rung, and from one com- mon heart gushed bounteous supplies. Laden trains were already flying to the relief of the houseless and starving. Loonardus, after much   difficulty, reached thlle west side, and found Mrs. IIortonse.. She was comfortable, but in great distress of mind concerning her daughter. He promised to lot her know as soon as lie could obtain any inforna- tion. He galloped on, intending by a long dttour to reach theo unburned por- tion of the south side, and learn if possi- blo of the fate of Spicy and Mrs. Vance. Somewhere near Twelfth-Street bridlge ho stopped to hear the story of thle vicious cow that had kicked over thle kerosene-lamp that had burned up two   hundred millions of dollars, when some one called his name, and, turning his head, he saw  Spicy's carriage being reined up to where he was sitting on his horse, with Dr. Gilderslceve in it. They exchanged questions and answers with great rapidity, and started north at al, brisk rate, Leonardus keeping as near the carriage-window as his raw-boned old ambler would permnit. Dr. Gilder- sleeve was distressed tlo moment he learned that Helen had not reached our house, and Leonardus trembled for Mrs. Vance. Spicy was at hler friend's cot- tage with her children, in bed, and ten- derly cared fir. They turhed aside when north of Lake Street for Leonardus to point out the hous  e w here o had left Mrs. Hor- tense, but they would not take tim0 to stop now. There was a carriage in front of it, however, at -which Leonardus looked the second time. - An idea struck him, for he asked Dr. Gildersleeve to wait while he rode that way. Yes, it was Richard on the box, holding Mrs. Vance's singed horses. he had stayed on the west side withi a friend, but was out early to see whom he could find. Mrs. Hortense was the only person of whom he knew the whereabouts; he had obtained that information from Leonar- dus among the terrors of yesterday. He thought by applying to her he should get the clew to others. She told him that General Belmore blad been there, and was coming again. Hle waited, and was rewarded. Leonardus ordered him   to follow thllem, as they were on the search for Mrs. -Vance, and the nman was only too glad to obey, for hoe loved his mistress.   The extreme northern limit ofi the city reached, and they moved slowly and peered anxiously among the groups of dejected-looking people by the way- sides. It was enough to wring O(IC's heart to see them in their misery, to say nothing of the heart-rending and harrow- ing tales of distress to whichh they could not stop to listen. Lincoln Park, in- deed How hope to find the lost in that incongruous assemblage? Leaving the carriages and the farm- er's horse in charge of the drivers, Leonardus and Dr. Gilderslccve set out on their pilgrimage. Thley went across, they went up and down, they wound around anmong the paths and shrubbery, their eyes ever active-cever on the alert. "Mrs. Vanco may have obtained a vehicle and been transported far into the country," said Leonardus. Just then Cousin Phil nearly ran over him. "Away! Belnore, have you seen my mother?" "No. Have you lost her?" 'I fear so. Our house was b1urned while I was trying to get a few packages of mnoney out of the bank. I have no idea where to look for her." "I will take one side of the park aInd you the other, and we shall thereby com- pass more territory in the same space of time," said Dr. Gildersleevc, leaving them. Leonardus and Phil had scarcely pro- cecded half a hundred yards whllen they came upon the two pale women, watch- ing by the sleeping dead. Helen Gilder- sleeve, on the straightened cushions of the easy-chair, was neatly wrapped in   the water-proot, awaiting her last jour- ney.  Mrs. Vance was sitting on the ground, and Miss Terrapin's Ihead was ly- ing in her lap. Dr. Grcer, who had been revolving all thoe moring in ia circle, without finding any way to relievo tho ladies, appeared, and told Leonard us whlllt Mrs. Vance had undergone, and, since her carriage was so near, they both thought it best for her to go immediately to it, Phil offering to remain with Miss Terrapin until Leonlardus should over- take Dr. Gildersleeve. Mrs. Vance was far more exlnusted than she had even dreamued, and it was with great dificulty that, leaning on Dr. Greer's narm, she accomplished the dis- tance. He noticed. that her shoes were burned almost entirely off her feet, and that her eyelashes wer   gone. She begged Dr. Greer to go directly back to Miss Terrapin, and, once more buried among the cushions of her own luxurious carriage, gave way to a burst of grief. Richard got down from his scat, came round to the window, and said: "I don't think on so! Mrs. Chafferleo was carried as safe na a brickl. I don't think your block was much burned. I ruther guess the girls got the things out of the house, for they are deused smart workers." "Thank you, lRichal'rd. You are very kind," she replied, and lio wiped the dampness from hIls eyes, and was gladn lieo had mnadde his crudelo attempt at con- solation.  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7037-00000087"/> CHAPTER XXI. THE SLEEPING   DEAD. THREE-QUARTEES of an hour passed. Then was seen approaching, slowly^ Leo- nardus and Phil, bearing all that re- mained of Helen Gildersleeve, Beside them walked her husband, looking ten years older than when he entered the Park, and, following, Dr. Greer assisted Miss Terrapin, who, like Mrs. Vance, could hardly support her own weight. He helped her into the carriage with Mrs. Vance, who, at the first moment possible, held an earnest conversation with Leonardus; then the door of her carriage was closed, and she was on her way to her aunt Mary, at our place of refuge on the prairie. Dr. Greer and Dr. Gildersleeve were both amazed at the abruptness of her de- parture. They both wished to speak to her. Dr. Greer had indefinitely formed projects in his mind. Perhaps he might 'be able to serve her. He had words for her ears, at all events. Dr. Gildersleeve was profoundly grateful to one who had shown such rare self-abnegation in min- istering to his unfortunate wife; for Dr. Greer and Miss Terrapin had both borne testimony, during the few minutes he had been with then. he was wonder- ing if the English language could furnish him any form of speech with which to thank her as he wished, when, lo! she was gone, and he had not even seen her face. His quick mind had settled the ques- tion in regard to Helen's remains. They must be taken East and deposited in the old family vault, whrere her fathers slept. The difficulties in the way, and they   were many, must be overcome by per- sistent, energetic effort. West Chicago was intact, except the portions near the river, and they could doubtless find some church where she could be received and prepared for removal. They made the attempt, and, not until the dead rested in a simple pine coffin, did Leonardus turn his face ruinward. The world may well wonder, for where was there ever such undaunted pluck and enterprise manifested as among the business-men of Chicago? With their great commercial structures still crum- bling and smoking about them, with their wealth still buried in vaults beneath the ruins, with no assurance as to what measure of indemnity they could expect from the insurance companies for their terrible losses, they were already at work devising ways and means to re- build thecity, and reestablish its com- mercial supremacy in the West. Leo- nardus spent the remainder of the day among those cool-headed men, who had already organized relief-committees in every division of the city to provide food and shelter for the destitute, and, not until long after the shades of evening had fallen, did he return to us. He slept on the kitchen-floor, with a buffalo- robe wound about him, and was off again in the morning before the sun was up. There was no repining at losses; although few had lost more heavily than we, no manifestations of discouragement, no faint-heartedness, on his part. "If Mrs. Vance's carriage is avail- able, try to meet us at the church at one o'clock this afternoon, as there will be brief funeral exercises," were hispart- ing words to me, through the cat-hole   of the door, for five of us occupied im- provised beds in one apartment. He seemed, to have room in his heart for every thing, nor was I jealous of my apparently infinitesimal place at such a time. Fred Gildersleeve arrived from New York that same morning. His brother met him at the train, and prepared his mind for what was to follow. Ite had passed through a fearful season of ex- citement and cankering anxiety on his journey.  All sorts of rumors had reached him. The telegrams received in New York before le left excited the greatest consternation in view of the probable financial results. The panic at the Stock Exchange was scarcely sur- passed by that of the Black Friday, so fresh in the memory of America's sons. One word alone-Chicago-seemed to be the beginning of every sentence ut- tered in the great metropolis. It was shouted by the newsboys, buzzed by the dealers in stocks, whispered by bankers and startled insurance-agents, discussed aloud by friends and strangers, by peo- ple walking and by people riding, by people selling and by people buying, by rich and by poor, by old and by young. Fred Gildersleeve would have moved heaven and earth to reach his wife, had it been possible.  But he must wait till the train went. He knew his horse was burned long before that huge engine spit and sputtered and puffed and jerked the cars out of New York. He had the utmost confidence in Spicy's herbism and strength of character, but whIt could a woman do, tied down with three little children? He learned what a woman could do and had done I   I complied with Leonardus's wishes, but neither Mrs. Vance nor Miss Terra- pin was able to leave her bed. Mrs. InubetjidO and Bright accompanied me, for I hacd promised the former to drive about among the refugees and try to find her husband. Dr. Gildersleeve, and his brother, Mrs. Hortense, Dr. Greer, and Leonar- dus, were already at the church when we arrived.  The pastor and two or three stlangers were also present. The exercises commenced immediately, and were beautifully appropriate. A few flowers had been scattered on the coffin, and we all took a final farewell glance at the marble face, upon which there was no trace of pain or suffering now -but peace, sweet peace. I had just time to takoe Mrs. lior- tense's hand and express my ardent sympathy in her affliction, whetn Leonar- dis hurried ine to the carriage, whisper- ing : "We are already iun danger of miss- ing the train-having waited for you to get here." Why was I always behind timl in every thing? I sat looking after them until they were out of sight, and then turned my attention to Mrs. IIuberjide. She knew one family on th west side; sle tlought it not only possible, but probable, that Mr. Ilublcrjido would re- port himself there. She told me tihe number as near as she could remember, and I hunted it up. She was right in her conjectures. Mr. IIu bcrjido was there. he had arrived aDout an hour before ourselves. he was surprised to meet his wife tlus. I don't know what he thought had become of hier. He had  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7037-00000088"/> run for the lake when he saw the fright- ful sight of flames striking buildings and going directly through them, often send- ing their bristling tongues rods into tho rear and into some other building at the same moment I What chance was there for a man"when the very bricks were consumed instantaneously? Heo buried himself in sand and water until he was taken off by a tug. He ihad been forty- eight hours without food, and was finish- ing a rather long-drawn-out meal of cold nceat and bread-and-butter while he talked with us. He declared upon his word as a gentleman of honor that he had never seen such a fire in his life. I be- lieved him. I left Mrs. IIubeljido to compare notes and see if they could set- *tle thb question between them, which {iad encountered the most danger. ^ -. When I told Leonardus about the in- jf:rvie%, he laughed. ,X "liHe was a New-York man, you say? '/t Tllat accounts for it all. He can't stand '  f. .:ir&amp;. If he and his wife rode in a coal-  'art from the Tremont to Indiana Street, I should have supposed they would have hung together to the end of thoe route. 3But he probably thought that wives wero a commodity which could boe got any day-if lie should by any chance get   burned himself, tlere would be no more t; marrying or giving in lmarriage."  I shook my head reprovingly.   I was like Esther, averse to l-vity on grave ' subjects. I was glad they had found : each other, and I hoped that New York would send them another wedding-outfit. Before lie slept Wednesday night, Fred Gildersleeve blad rented a furnished cottage on the lboower part of Michigan Avenue, and, on Thursday, moved his   - family, with the few things Spicy had 1 saved, into it. The next morning their - carriage came for us.  I was sorry to o leave Mrs. Vance behind, but there was e no alternative, for it did not seem pru- e dent to try to move Mrs. chhafferlee. e Miss Terrapin was quite siclk, also, and I Mrs. Vanco insisted upon keeping and taking care of her. "If I have enoughl money left to in- sure me a pint of oatmeal per day, I shall settle a pension on ,Miss Terrapin, for her faithfulness to me on Monday," she said. But 'how was it likely to boe about her pint of oatmeal per day? That was the question.  Dr. Greer had been to the farmer's house to discuss it with ler, and had gone away sadder tlan he came. Lconardus said the land was left, if the blocks of stores and dwellings were gone. Slhe would probably recover something from  tOle Eastern insurance companies. Not one in Chicago would ever pay five cents on a dollar. How was she situated at present? She had not a   solitary penny.  Her purse, swhich was in her pocket When sh left her housecwas not there at a  later date. Whetler it had been lost or stolen, it was all the same- gone.  Leonardus hadn't any money. He had paid his last dollar to a boy for running with a  message for him during the second hour of the fire.  I hadn't any, not even a pocket-book. I left that under my   pillow, where I usually put it at night.  But Spicy always had 1money, and I promised to send some to Mrs. Vance for present necessities, as soon as we got to the south side. WlVat was my consternation on find-   ing Spicy without a dollar! She had piaid all she had to workmen and others during( the fire. And, whllat was more em2barrassing  still, Fred had returned firom New York with less tlian twenty- five dollars in his pocket, lled that had all been spent in getting his family safely housed. "We are a pretty set!" said Loonar- dus, walking up and down. "Haven't yot any credit?" asked Fred. "I did have, but it is in dust and ashes now.  I dare say I shall have again, but I should like a quarter or ten cents to carry in my pocket meanwhile. It makes a man feel more like a man, you know." "How would it do to set up a curios- ity-sfand and charge five cents a look?" said Fred, producing some half-melted sleec-chuttons which! le had picked up, and which were in themselves mournful evidences of the naltion' callanity. "That rcminds me," said Leonardus, "of a stick of petrified wood which nwas shown me yesterday. It hd been ex- humed fronm under a drug-store whlcre it is supposed to havd been converted into stone by some new and hitherto undis- covcred process connected with the fire. It really had the density and weight of stone. Some thought it maple by the grain, others declared it pine, judging from the pitch-deposits whchl seemed to be in it. It was cut up- and distrilutcd among quite a number of gentlemen), and a piece is to be submitted to Prof. Pagan, of St. Louis, who, if you remember, lost his position as State geologist, by refus- ing to acknowledge that tin urrew in Missouri."   "I saw something still mnlc remark- alle, to-day," said Fred. "I saw tho IIin. Clemence Fortescue, State Senator of Nchralska, carrying in a toni of coal by hatnd.

Leon'irdlus's lip curled under his mus- taclhe, but he continued his promenade. At oneo end of the library was at sm1111ll1 conservatory filled with choice plants and ilowers', lld, 'onspicuous there, a tube-rose, muchl too weitglty for its feeble stalk, was trying to open its potals.  Ito paused befoore the glass door and re- garlcded it intently, then turned abtruptly toward Fred. "Itow did you happen to find this gemi of a cottage ail fitted lup as it were to order? It never occurred to me to inquire before." Fred stmiled.  There was sormething very peculiar about Fred's smile. 11 "Ah, general, thereby lhangs a tale. It was  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7037-00000089"/> the third house I rented on that mem- orable Wednesday which seems a month ago, judging from events sinte, after we parted with Brother Grandison at the cars. The first belonged to iny old part- ner Stevens. I met him jist' after you left me at the corner of Wan ph Avenue and EighteenlI Street, and,/asihe did not seem to be golng anywfrerein particu- lar, I offered to take hiii there. He was in a state of great nervous excitement, had lost heavily, had beenr?yl0lout sleep for three days and nights, anwas near- ly famished for want of fobd. He talked about sending his family to friends in Pittsburg, and I proposed to rent his hlouse off his hands. The idea struck him favorably, wo discussed all the pros and cons, and closed the bargain, except signing time lease, whch was to be ac- complished in the course of the day. I stopped to see Spicy, and was to join him at the house, which I wishld to examine, in half an hour. When I amrived, accord- ing tO appointment, I found his practical wife just closing an arrangement with another gentleman. Stovens undertook an explanation,-but I did not wait to hear it. I hurried, to the next block, where I could see a sign swinging': Found a de- cent three-story brick, the paste on the notice 'TO LET, not yet dry. The propri- otor rented it to me for one hundred dol- lars per month, and I left,' to see about raising the requisite amount of money to advance before putting our names to papers. The man kniew me, henco I had no fears of hls breaking his word. I stopped to see Spicy again, for you must know that I had as yet exchanged but a few words with her. The doctor, Wllo seemed wretchedly anxious as to the re-   sults of her. extreme prostration, stood guard at her door, and forbade our talk- ing over five minutes at a tine, and pro- hibited a word of reference to the late terrible scenes which she had passed through. I took my carriage, which had just been put in the barn, for a drive out to Danforth's on the west side, knowing that ho always kept money at his house, and never doubting but that lhe would cash a draft for me on New York. I was hindered for a few minutes talking withl some gentlemen at Twelfth-Street bridge, and a little beyond I met Charles Hinchman. He was on horseback, riding furiously, but reined up to shake hands with me through the carriage-window- said his family were yet in the open air somewhllere on the north side, but that he had hired a house, and was going for them, hoping to get them under cover before nightfall. I congratulated him upon lhaving found such a rare commod- ity as a house, and told him ]ow I had been similarly blessed. Ite inquired wlcre minie was located, and I told him No. - labash Avenue. "' What! in the Wilhnarth block? ' "Yes.' "' Impossible I I have just rented that house myself.' "' engaged to pay one hundred dol- lars per month for it not more than an lour ago! ' "'AndI signed a lease agreeing to give two hundred dollars per imonth not twenty minutes since H' "There was no longer any question about who had the best fight to the es- tablishment. The afternoon was waning, and we did not waste many more min- utes together. I drove up and down and   over and across; I inquired everywhere and of everybody. I was told it wan of no use. Others had scoured every inch of the standing part of the city, and there +was not a house of any sort to be had. I was about to give up the search for that day, when Ily eye lighted upon a bit of paper piined upon the door of this cot- tage. In an instant I was upon the steps, and five gentlemen followed me. In an- swer to my violent ring a lady opened the door, evidently much agitated. I asked( the rent of the house. ' One hundred and twenty-tivo dol- lars per monthh, she said, in a feverish tone. "'I will take it, you may tell these gentlemen the house is rented,' replied, quickly, and walked in while saying so, although the lady stopped aside to let meo pass her with apparent reluctance. "My son has already gone out to inquire after the responsibility of four or five applicants, and I cannot give you an answer now,' sho said, turning slightly pale. "'But I will take the house, and I must have my answer now,' I repllied, authoritatively, and, dropping into a chair by the centre-table, I commenced writing with my pocket-pencil upon a scrap of paper which lay there. "' What are you doing? ' she asked, with a distressed look. I "Drawincg up a contract for you to sign.' "'Indeed, sir, I cannot sign any con- tract now, nor give you the refusal of the house even, until my son returns. Please don't try to take advantage of an unpro- tected lady.' "' Have no fears on that score, mad-   anm; on the contrary, I will endeavor to protect you. And, as those gentlemen upon the steps are rattler clamorous for admittance, you had bettor tell themn the house is rented, for I shall take it.' "She looked tat mo with incredulous wonder! Her situation must have been a painful one. She had been induced to put her house in the market in order to fly to someo safer abode, but lad nlever dreamed that overwhelling numbers would wrangle owith each otler in order to secure it!--There was ta fcuflo on tlio veranda, and one man knocked another down.

She was loth to do so; said she did not wish to incur such a responsibility, it might boe stolen, or the remainder of the city might burn; but I rmado'her keep it. I then drove over to DanforthS,' and, to- mly surprise, ho refused to icash lmy paper! Said the whole country would go to smash, New York banks and all. Said he hadn't a dollar, but he knew I knew that he was lying. It was eight o'clock by the timle I got back to Mrs. Sontag's, and I found her with trunks packed and anxious to leave for the East on the ten-o'clock evening train. She seemed to think what wans left of the city would certainly burn before shhe could get out of its limits. As she was going to New York, I offered her a sight-draft, which she accepted; the whole business was closed-she went out, and wo came in." "There is something strikingly In- miliar in the falshion of these roo'ms," said Leonardus. He 1ad twice walked to the parlor-door, as if on a tour of ob- servation, while Fred had been telling his story.    \ An idea ran like a knife through my brain just at that' instant! We were in the old Dwilght mansion, which had been moved down-town, backed upon a cor- ner lot, and remodelled and fitted up until it was not so 'much to be wondered at that we did not recognize it readily.   Spicy, propped up with cushions on theo sofa, laughed quite like herself when I pointed out the old familiar niches in the walls. But her face saddened again in- stantly, for the associations of the ghost- closet, the recent revelation, and the sad termination of the life of poor Helen Gildersleeve, wero too painfully fresh in her mind.  And I thought of Nursy Brown, and whlat she must have suffered during the ti2ne she lived with me as a servant, for the very shape of the win- dows and doors, notwithstanding their new dress, carried me back to tlioso other and long-ago days.  Fred inter- rupted my reverie, for we had all been eloquently silent for a time. "But about this money-matter, gen- eral; if you won't undertake to make any by honest labor, we shall be relieved as soon as Grandison gets back:, next week, for he is so fortunate as to have his laid. away at the East, and will be prepatred to help the rest of us until we can stand on our own feet." "Water seems of more account tlian money just now," said Spicy. "There is none nearer than the lake, and we shall need solme dinner by-and-by." "That is only a few blocks away  John must bring some instead of driving us to the ruins. We will takeothe cars." Thle cars, indeed! lwho will pay for us? I think Ne will take to our feet," said Leonardus, laughing. "And how about the dinner?" asked Spicy. "If there are no butcher-shops and grocerieL, and no supplies in the city, and no money -" Fred laid his hand across her mouth. "Do you remember the mock-trial on board the steamnboat last summler, when   the culprit 'was sentenced to be hanged, after that imprisoned for life, and, upon his release, doomed to join the temper- ance-society?" "I am, not able to make the applica- tion," interrupted Leonardus. "I, suppose not, since it does not reach your case. But it is hardly worth while for us to sit and look at each other like a party of children who have lost all their marbles--particularly when it is a lnatter of somethng to eat. I am get- ting ulp an appetite myself. Come, geln- eral, let us go on a foraging cxpc- dition." "I donl't see what you cn do!" said Spicy. "Trust two good - looking men to scare up something.  Was it not I who invented a potato-candlestick last -night? Ilave you no blind faith? I don't think I shall apply to theo relief-colmmlittee, of wVich General Belhnore here ha)pens to be one; unless it is for a cigar, I'm (d- ing for a smokc," and Fred kissed Spicy, anid the two strode away. Slaturday morning, I went over to see bMrs. Yancc, and recited the various straits to which we had all been sub- jected by the want of a few dollars in change.  Whlo ever kInew before that one had so many ways for money? It was just as impossible to borrow as it was to lend,! Whore one was as well off as we, ten thousand were worse off. Money I such a thing was not in circula- tion! Mrs. Vance smiled. "It is something of a shock to drop from an incone of one hundred thousand dollars a year to nothing," she said. "Yes, and to be cut off from every   souvenir of the past, as I am. Not a fragment of any tillng exists that w-: once mnlll. Not even a pocket-hlandker- chllief, nor a precious gift, nor jewel, nor pen-strok-alll my idols are gone."  I was weak enough to breaklol  down1 there, for what I had had, and I fear too lightly appreciated, came rushing into my mind, and Mrs. Vance sprang and threw her arms around me and kissed, me without speaking. Was she weeping, also? I recovered myself presently, for I thought of Leonardus, and how much harder the blow had fallen upon him than me, and I went to the window and commented upon the fine-looling chick- ens which were stalking up and down the yard, and asked Mrs. Vance how her horses liked boarding on hay. She said Richard was in the greatest distress for want of a curry-comb and brush. After a while I got back to the origi- nal object of my visit, to tell her how the dreadful money-pinch wotuld be over as soon as Dr. Gildersleevo returned, fori, he was expected to bring a small bank in his trunk. Oil, low  quickly the spirit tod; alarm! "You need not beo weigledd down with care for me, mly dear M.1I. 1Belmior. Aunt Mary is now ablo to go to Dtroit, and I sliall leave on Monday. The rail- road is issuing free tickets-- luisl (its I attempted to interrupt Iher)! Iwhat l1mat- ters it if I do accept the provisions of' it grand and spontaneous charity? I wotuld not even lhesitiato to dwell under olne (f those twelve thousand tents whchh havte been sent to sheltor the houseless. But  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7037-00000091"/> it is not necessary. I have distant rela- tives in Detroit, or rather Aunt -Mary has, and they will give us cordial wel- come. Herbert, her son, is in a position to help her, and for the rest I must trust in God. The good farmer here declines to accept any compensation for his ser- vices, as he did in your case; but he will be the first one I shall remember if ever my turn comes." I tried to combat her purpose. Fred and Spicy had a room designated for her in their house. But she was firm. As for Miss Terrapin, I took her home with me. IHow she Mnourned over the loss of her wig I  fIer few  scattering hairs, which had not been white befbre the fire, were white now, and slbe felt the October cold about her head keenly. "Are all the hair-dressing establish- ments burned?" was her pathetic inquiry when I commenced making her toilet, preparatory to the drive, withl a coarse horn-comb, belonging to the farmer's wife. Yes.  But I bade her never mind. We should be quite exclusive and by ourselves. Nobody need see her. She appeared resigned. But, when I had completed the task, she asked for a look- ing-glass. "Singular that my hair sh'ould turn as it has! But it always run in our family to get gray young." Esther, quite indignant that we were not forthcoming in the pay for her bag- gage, which had been destroyed, left us on  Wednesday morning, and  went to look for another place. I had taken Maggie with me to my   sister's house, and the indefatigable Richard had stunm- bled  about until he had found Mrs.   'Vance's servants, and they were with r her assisting in the care of Mrs. Chaffer- - lee, until she could make some provision i for them. t  I intended to meet Mrs. Vance on ]s M[od)ay, but, one of Spicy's horses was - ,sick, and I could not get to lher. A note I from her on Tuesday told of her safe ar- r rival in Detroit, and the kindness of her friends. Dr. Gildersleeve arrived on Wednes- r day evening, having left Mrs. Hortense 3 with her relatives. He brought a rift L of sunshine with him, in the shape of a warm   heart and plenty of greenbacks. Hoe was more fortunate than any of' us, for, save in his paper, which was bound to live and thrive, in spite of its scorch- ing, lie he ad invested very little in Chi- cago. He was ready to do so now. I hecard him saying to Leonarduss: "She las all the elements of a great city  left, except the mere buildings. Look at her river-harbor, which hlas been dredged and enlarged, at enormous ex- pense I And her piers and breakwaters. See ther light-houses, for the security of navigation I See her tunnel under Lake Michigan, competent to supply a+" city of tlrice her recent magnitude with pure wiater! . Then there is her expen- sive system  of sewcrage, which, being underground, and of incombustible mate- rial, of course has not been consumed I And all, the grading of her streets and the excavation of her cellars and vaults I And her vast cattle-yards and pork-pack- ing establishments!  The loss of her railroad-depots, however severely felt, will not obstruct travel and traffic, for passengers can be received and landed, and freight delivered, in the open air!   And, what is more, Chicago has not lost her shrewd, enterprising, energetic, in- domitabld men of business. The brill- iant, powerful city of a week ago has still its finalncial, commercinl, social, and domestic roots stretched to the remote quarters of the earth; its marked quotal- tions and opinions in all American cities; its prices of grains, hides, and lumber, in Europc; its trade connections reaching througwh San Francisco to China and Ja- pan, and its personal family ties every- where. Her sorrow is a common sor- row. Her uprising from her ashes will be a common joy." His earnestness and well-timed and efficient aid stiiiulated  and inspired many a desponding heart.  Leonardus said men's faces brightened when he ap- peared among them. Ilis own was grave, but there was a well of tenderness lidld- den behind its outward secning.   He had encouraging words for nll, and some- thing in his purse for many more than the world would ever discover. He was ceaseless in his inquiries for Mrs. Vance.  Hie wanted to render lier some substantial token of his apprecia- tion of her unspeakable kindness to his wife.  He charged me with many and l various messages, which   I never de- livered.  He knew that she had been robbed of all her possessions; he had heard us- make many and frequent allu-  sions to it, and wondered why Spicy and f myself were so opposed to his sending  her a  check. I told himh that she was i too high-toned a  woman to accept a fa- i vor, even though it might come in the spirit of gratitude on Illiis part, and be en- t tirely her due.  Then he tried to force it I upon one or the other of us to send as t   we saw fit, and was grieved that we should decline. We remained with Spicy while .eo- nardius laid the foundations of new for- tunes and hlopes. o Ilnad lost so heavily that we tried not to think or talk of it between ourselves.  Every word was like blistcring a bloeeding wound. Fred Gilderslecve, thanks to his wife, had only received a set back of 1a few months.  Choice possessions l1t1d been burned which no money could ever re- place, but friom the great bulk of his solid prop)erty he had only to count out about one year's income. I heard from MSirs. Yance often. Leo- nardtus tried to do somnetliing for her when lio was in New York and Boston, but insurance-money camele slowly. l[er letters were cleerful-fiar more so than mine-although I was sure tha:t she must ' have imany and pressing needs to which she made no allusion. Tho new year lad dawned ulpon us, and lRussiL's royal scion, tlile (ratld-dtuk Alexis, ihad been entertained withl the most magnificent ruins of the 8'ge. It was all chicago h ad to oflr, save warm and cordial greetings, and Ipr'ofolndecst respect fo)r the 1)'owrful and enlightened nation which lie represe9nted. 1Ie was her guest, and his princely prescnce in- filssel new life into her working heroes, although the city could not indulge in an ostentatious and formal reception. She could only extendl the right hand of fellowship and lie in very ruins til, hs feet. Leonardus returned front  ilwaullllkee tho day after the grand  banltquet at, tle I'lankinton Iouse. We   were all anxiollus to learn particulars. Heo described tho  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7037-00000092"/> order in which the guests were seated at the table. "The grand-duke was the centre of attraction. He was dressed in orthodox clothes, and, except that he was the handsomest man present, could not have been distinguished fromn the other guests. lHe seems to be rather of an investigat- ing and practical tu;'n of mind, and cares, I think, more for a clear insiglt into our customs, resources, and manufacturing interests, than for state dinners." "' And what of the speelices?" asked Fred. "Excellent. What the grand -dluke said was pithy and to the point. Ad- miral Polin responded to the toast, Tllohe Russian Navy.' 13ut theo hlappiest speech of the evening was from Count Boris. I can recall only a part of it, but, speaking of his present trip through the West, lie sani that lhe realized imore than ever be- fore that westward tileho star of emlpire takes its way,' was no legend, but a fixed fact. But, in R11ussia, eastward the star of empire works its way, and ho boped the tilme would soon cone when the re- lations of Russia and America would be- come so intimate that a ferry-boat should ply Bering Straits." "Who is Count Boris?" inquired Spicy. "' The leading Russian in America at the present time, with the exception of Prince Alexis himself,1" replied Leonar- dus. "But I must hasten to tell you of an Eastern capitalist whom I run upon as I was crossing over from the Milwau- kee cars. He is feeling round for a place to pile up a few loose dollars, and I called his attention to the site of Mrs. Vance's Lalke-Street block. I amu to see him in   the morning, and I should not be sur- prised if she got a bid." I hoped so most sincerely. It was several weeks afterwar d, however, be- fore my blopes were realized, for he was one of those cautious men who look long before investing. but he at last mnade a direct offer for its purchase. Lconardus telegraphed to Mrs. Vance to come to Chicago in the next train, and I went to the cars to receive her. 1Dr. Gildersl!cve was staying with us. and was cognizant of all the facts, ex- cept that lie only knew of MArs. Vance as Mrs. Vancc. It was just before dinner wlichen slie arrived. Cheerful grate-fires were burn- ing in parlor, library, and dining-room. Spicy had arranged about the apartments a half-dozen or mnore pretty bouquets fro'm her private conservatory, and the per- fuilo of unseen heliotrope was every- where faint and sweet. Leonardus had been with me to the train, and Fred and Spicy were rarely more cordial than when welcoming their present guest. In spite of the fatigue of a cold day's journey, I never saw a woman so well worth looking at. Her l]ead, poised like that of a queen, and her stylish travel- ling-suit of soft drab nmering, *with hat to match, suiting her so wonderfully. iHer costume simple enollugh, and, rs I afterward learned, the w ork of her own hlands, but so artistic in its finisl that I could only think of Raphael's draperies. The absenco of life-giving colors, so try- ing to most people, was singularly effec- tive in bringing out the full brilliancy of her complexion, and in giving life and expression to her classic features. Her beauty Nwas of a kind to grow upon one,   like some incomprehensible masterpiece of art. She was glad to gee us, and her face was lighted with the-genial warmth of her nature; but, did I fancy that her sweet graciousness, which had so won my heart in the days gone by, had given place .to a certain hauteulr of manner? It did not occur to me that I had noticed the same thing, and thought the same thoughts, every time I had met her for years I She was a study, and I went on studying her, while I laid her wraps one after another upon the sofa, and wheeled a large easy-chair toward the fire for her to occupy. At that moment Dr. Gildersleeve, wlho had been engrossed with a book in the library during our somewhat noisy greet- ings, entered the parlor, 'nnd I introduced him directly to Mrs. Yanco; but, with all our conjectures and divinations, we were totally unprepared for what fol- lowed. Mrs. Vance flushed violently, even her lips turned scarlet, as her eyes miet thioso of Dr. Gildersleeve.  He had advancedl with  extended hland, but he suddenly stood still, his arm dropping powerless by his side, and his face whitenint until it was ashy pale.  he had recognized ( her, and I  felt, as it were, through the air, the shock by which the whole truth flooded his mind.  Who may ever know t wltat words were scorching his tongue, and crying, like souls in pain, to be ut- t tered? Tears--youth's long-lost famil- 1 iars-glittered in his speaking  eyes, as u they rested upon her with a sort of rev- ( erential awe; and yet, the concentrated I passion of months and of years flashed in s their heart-searching gaze. What did he f read in the depths of her blue orbs?  n 12   Why stood they there in silence, as if r regarding eaclh other from the lonely length of each life? Are there loves in this world for which time can renew all that time may destroy? Are there lives that cling to one faith and dio with it? His voice came at last, husky, yet thrilling: "Ida!" The response was soft, and sweet as a tune that one knows. "Grandison!" I did not see, but by sonme mysterious intuition I was conscious, that he had snatched her to his heart. I did not hear, but a low, short, sharp, stifled, agonized  sob froil her lips was tele- graphed to my senses.  I was in the dining-room endeavoring to suppress a fit of hysterics, to wlichl I was not it all subject. Spicy was there before mne, busy moving each plato and individual butter about an inch farther toward the 1head of the table, and then, having sepa- rated them  too far from their napkins, moved them all back again.  Somiething sparkled on  iher chcek like a diamnond, but I supposed it couldn't beo one, since it is not the customary place to wear diamonds.  Ilather unexpectedly slio wound her arms rounld mIly neck. "What a  secret that lias been for us to keep!" sho said. Raising my eyes after a while, when tlohe shower had passed by, I saw Fred leaning against theo library mantel in Iis usual attitude of case and self-possession. One hand  toyed negligently with the flowers in a  vase, and, as the leaves scattered, he carefully brushed them back from the edge of the marble, that they might nlot fall upon the carpet. He was  &#xD;<pb n="178-179 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7037-00000093"/> never handsomer, nor his tone steadier, than when, with a perplexed frown, ho summoned Spicy to his- side to ask for a solution of what now for the first time, since hearing her remark, struck him as an inexplicable problem. I did not hear their conversation, bVt the secret which Spicy huad kept so long was a secret no longer, as far as he was concerned. Bright was the most considerate mem- ber of the family, for, in quietly leaving the parlor, after seeing the rest of us do so, lie shut the door behind him. "Mammnla!" said lie, softly. looking very much disturbed, "I saw Dr. Gil- dersleovo kiss MWi. Vance, and she never tried to go away, nor any thing I But I suppose it is their own affair, and you mllust not tell it to any one." Leonardus came down from the nur- sery presently, where he had been romlp- ing " with Spicy's little soldiers," he said. I am sure I don't know when llo went up there t He took me to task for leaving my guest so rudely. 4' Mrs. Vance is a woman of genius, and will credit you with plotting against her peace."   "She may be a woman of genius, but she is essentially human," -I re- sponded. But the dinner was spoiling, and the cook showed symptoms of impatience by sending two or three times to know it' we were ready to have it put upon thle table. Spicy said I must go back to theo parlor and do the honors, while she went up-stairs to her children for a few mo- ments. Fred and Leonardus were both of the opinion that it was a duty which devolved upon lme. Briglit said: "';Mamman, hadn't you better rattle the door a little beforec you go in?" I only coughed. The occupants of the parlor did not sieem to notice myv consumptive tendencies.  They  were standing where we left them, I)r. Gil- dersleeve's arms ncircling Mrs. Vance, and her proud head resting upon lis broad bosom, as it would henceforth everlore rest. he was saying, as I ap- proached them: , "Ida, in those long-ago summer days at Rockland Place, had I spoken, might I have hoped then?" "You might."   THE END.   3 :DXI::r"r0iJ  0:F CHARLES DICKE:NS'S NOVELS.

THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY, CONDUCTED BY Professor E. L. YOUMANS. THE growing importance of scientific knowledge to all classes of the community calls for more efficient means of diffusing it. THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTIINY has been started to promote this object, and supplies a want met by no other periodical in the United States. It contains instructive and attractive articles, and abstracts of articles, original, se- lected, and illustrated, from the leading scientific men of different countries, giving the latest interpretations of natural phenomena, explaining the applications of science to the practical arts, and to the operations of domestic life. It is designed to give especial prominence to those branches of science which help to a better understanding of the nature of man; to present the claims of scientific edu- cation; and the bearings of science upon questions of society and government. How the various subjects of current opinion are affected by the advance of scientific inquiry will also be considered.' In its literary character, this periodical aims to be popular, without being superficial, and appeals to the intelligent reading-classes of the community. It seeks to procure authentic statements from men who know their subjects, and who will address the non- scientific public for purposes of exposition and explanation. It will have contributions from IIERBERT SPENCER, Prof. HUXLEY, Irof. TYNDALL, Mr. DARWIN, and other writers identified with speculative thought and scientific in- vestigation.

"   1 50 GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART! Paper. 75 cents; 12mo, cloth,  -  -"         1 5 "Good-bye, Sweetheart!" is certainly one of the brightest anl most entertalning novels that has appeared for many years. The heroine of the story, Lenore, is really an original character, drawn only as a woman could draw her, who had looked deeply into tle mysterious recesses of the feminine heart. She is a creation to- tally beyond the scop)e of a inll's pen, unless it were the pen of Shakespeare. Her beauty, her wilfullness, her caprice, her love, and her sorrow, are depicted with marvellous skill, and investedl with an interest of which the reader never becomes weary. AMiss Broughton in this work, has made an immense advanlce on hler other stories, clever as those are. Hecr sketches of scenery and of interiors, though brief, are eminently graphllic, and the dialogue is always sparkling and witty. The incidents, thoug   h sometimes startlingr a bnd unexpected, are very natural, and the characters and story, firom the beginning to the end, strongly nchailn the attenl- tion of the reader. Opinionsof the Press on "Red as a Rose is She." i'om the Boston Traeche-. "After reading such a work, one can no more read an ordinary book than on, could enjoy a lunch on dry bread immediately after having dined on curry and Chili, washed down with burnt brandy." From the Balthnore Cazelle. "The clercverest novel of the season. The characters are few, but remarkably well drawn; the dialogue fresh, crisp, and sparkling, and the incidents thoroughly natural."
