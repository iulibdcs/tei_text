TO-DAY an old friend came to our private room and asked: "Did you know , of Milwaukee, when you lived there?" "Yes." "Did you know his daughter, who attended the -- Ward school?" "Not the very pretty girl, who was so quick, attractive, and so full of promise?" "The same," "What of her?   It is years since then-since we saw her in school one day, a little innocent girl, the pride of her parents, and the loved of all. What of her?" "She is dead!" "Well?" "She died  in this city this morning  early. Poisoned herself last night. And the keeper of the house where she is says she must be taken away this afternoon, for a dead person in the house kills luck." "Tell us more."  &#xD;<pb n="viii-ix" xml:id="VAC7470-00000004"/> viii        Prologue. And he told us a heart-rending history. Years ago, nine as the calendar counts, the one who had tired of life, was a child in Milwaukee, a distant city of the West. She was quick, bright, attractive, and over-petted to her injury. Her temper was hot- her charms many. She lived for excitement. She went aside from the path her loved parents had so well walked, and loitered in the bowers of that in- cipient sporting life, where those enticed slyly taste the fruit, and inhale the perfume of attractive flowers growing so beautifully on deadly vines. The poison went to her brain; the early life became warped as present pleasures were pla ted for future pains. She came and went; she roamed and romped like the butterfly that cares not for the winter; she sat, and rode, and walked, and talked, and rested with those who were feasting on her young loveliness, till home became irksome; and, when those Nwho loved her best did kindly ask her of the present, she rebelled, and inhaled more of the poison, which drove the good from the heart. She thought bowers were houses-rambles here and there amid vines and flowers were walks on the road to life. And when the flower fell and the thorn pricked her soul, instead of returning to the true path and seeking only the love of one, she tried other laby. rinths, and yet others. But, alas! the flowers fell everywhere, and everywhere the ugly thorns followed.   Prologue.        ix Then she left her home. Under a veil, and an assumed,-name she went to other cities:- she came to this and drank deep of the poison which gave fewer and yet fewer hours of pleasure and more 'and more days of grief. She was sought by this one-- by that one. She gave to this one and to that one. Keeping nothing for herself, living only on the froth, and never drinking deeply of the pure water beneath. With her back upon hearts, home, happiness, and true manly friendship, she sought her home in the whirl, and lived to float, and drift, and be tossed fromarnm to arm, as whim, fancy, or devil-leading passion drew Athe ribbon, or shot glances from watching eyes that were but detectives for baser souls within. With   our friend we went to her room. Up Broadway, and then into a side street. The ring of a door-bell brought a negro woman to open the walnut door of a palace, so-called. Up stairs to a beautifully, furnished bedroom-three of us, besides the undertaker and his assistant, with a plain coffin. Softly- in here. Ah!  She will not waken. We looked, and the tears came into our eyes, for all she was but a dead unfortunate. She was once a girl-once a   woman-once a  loved child, beside whose little bed fond parents have stood and gazed on her sleeping beauty, and thanked God for her coming.  &#xD;<pb n="x-xi" xml:id="VAC7470-00000005"/> x         Prologue. Finery everywhere. Silks, jewelry, articles of the toilet-pictures on the walls, dresses spotted by- wine, books of prose and poetry. A slipper on the right foot--silk stockings fitting her beautiful ankle-a little plain gold and three ,diamond rings on the fingers of the left hand, with a single-stone diamond-ring on the fore-finger of the right. A watch and chain lay noiseless on the bureau, stopped at fifteen minutes past four. Won- der if her life ran down then? God only knows! A little white kitten, with ribbon of blue about its neck, was sleeping on the pillow. Beside her was an empty ounce vial, which had contained laudanum. She lay partly across the bed, one hand under her head, as if sleeping; her beautiful hair dis- hevelled, but such a sad, sick, desolate'look on her face, the tears would not keep back. She had -died as she lived, in her finery. In her hand was a letter, - a good, kind, heart-written let- ter from one who had known her--who for years had tried to save her, for he loved her dearly. And the letter, with this chapter, we send to the writer, miles away, that he may know that the way- ward, giddy, whirling, careless, beautiful, thoughtless girl he loved, for all she was not true to herself, was taken to a quiet grave by ones who have kind hearts, and who will never reveal his secret, for thus do those fraternally bound by each other. She has gone, poor, heart-wreckedj, desolate-   Prologue.        xa souled, beautiful one. Let us hope to the care of those who will not pluck to destroy--who will fold her in loving embrace, and keep her with renewed purity for the one who so loved her, so kindly wrote to her, so well wighed her, yet whose honest love and kind interest had so little weight with her here. Her trunk was full of finery, and cards and pic- tures, and letters from the gay and thoughtless- full of odds and ends of a poisonous festival! And in a little 'box, as if sacred, the picture. of father, mlot-her, a sister,- and two brothers. What shall we do with them?  Send them home? They know not where she was, or is,! They only know she is away, but under what name, what doing, alive or dead, they know not, for all they have often sought, as we know. Shall we tell them, or carry the secret with others and others we hold to the grave? What would our readers do? What would be right? A hearse and a carriage. At dusk, or nearly. Steadily we  moved on down the street, meeting thousands. We   put her in a-plain coffin, for her life had been too plain of joy to mock her corpse and her great agony with a   gilded casket. The beautiful one she had she despised --would not preserve --would not confide to the keeping of the one she loved and who loved her, so infatuated was she  with the life she wanted to lead, so we would ow            ol  &#xD;<pb n="xii-xiii" xml:id="VAC7470-00000006"/>   xn       Prologue. not insult her corpse with the hate of her life! She rested--but oh! that sad, heart-wrecked, pity- pleading face seeming to cry out from its perishing stillness: ' O God! O man! Give-give -give! Oh! give me back to that life, that love, that truth, that purity, that -heart, --that all that would have been my salvation! O God! pity me, for the world does not! And give me rest, if I cannot have that hope, that faith, that bliss, that happy future I might have had but for careless wanderings."  - Over the river we bore her away. We met others like her on the streets, little caring or dreaming who was in the hearse ahead, or the carriage fol- lowing. We took her away, as they will be taken. If the graves of the lost ones could cry out, who could listen to the terrible wail? The love and passion-songs of earth-the discordant uni- sons of perdition, sufficient of themselves to curse millions and hold their souls down to agony.. Oh! the present--the future! The minute- the Eter- nity! O Father in Heaven! give us all will and power to save, but no heart to wreck, to destroy! We buried her as the sun went down on this beautifuf-Saturday Night. And we rode slowly home as the hearse went its way for another, or to wait an order! And we looked out of the carriage window as the dead one can look out of the window of the   Prologue.        xiii past to $ee where she mistook the road! And we saw people hastening to and fro-this way and that, eager to reach home. Poor girl-- she was eager to reach home! So she went uninvited- - glad to rest in the grave, anywhere, rather than ir her wild, heart-rending, soul-harrowing thoughts. Well- she is gone. God be kinder to her there, than she was to herself here! Fearful was the load she took with her! Every flower a thorn-every ramble a walk with fiends--every reckless dalliance a garment of torture woven on earth with the bright side out, to be worn there, with the stings piercing the soul. And God pity her parents--and him who loved her. She is at rest: the waters of the river, and the rack of the torture that drove her to death may purify her--we hope they vill. To-night we are going on a visit. To the bedside of our friends. We will kiss them while they sleep, and they will not know we were there. We will straighten the coverlets over the hearts and to the throats of those we love-will kiss them again and pray God to keep them all in the right path. And we will go for hours before we sleep to the bed- sides of those miles and miles away, and seie which are to be lost or to be saved -to the bedsides of those who sleep in sin and reckless, unloving pas- sion, and kiss them once never so softly for the mothers and fathers who have lost them  forever.  &#xD;<pb n="xiv-xv" xml:id="VAC7470-00000007"/> xiv        Prologue. Then to 'the sleeping forms of those who have lost loved ones in the terrible whirl, and whisper of the meeting Over There, where the truants will return, and then in the cribs, cradles, and beds of those who have good fathers and mothers to watch over them, and will with the loving and the living look with joy and pride on the sleeping ones, who little know in their childish dreams that while they sleep; while all is still, warm hearts are beating and tear- glistening eyes are looking and praying that they may live for those who most truly love them- from God to man, and not be taken to the grave as was the poor, storm-tossed, heart-wrecked, beau- tiful-child of misfortune we in sadness helped bury this Saturday Night.   INTRODUCTION. tI^^ THS is Saturday Night. -^ r  With others, in general, the labor of the week is ended. All over the land are weary men, and weary women and dear children who have homes, and dear ones who have none. "Well, what of them?" Only this: they need more true, earnest friends than they have; they are the toiling ones, who deserve kind words, and who should, who will, be kinder to each other. Long years have we suffered and battled for ideas, principles, and rights. By this ordeal we have learned to think. And to think of others. Of working-men, all over the land. Of weary, worthy, patient wives. Of children; of the good and the bad, everywhere. Now, as GOD is our judge, we do feel kindly to all men; we feel more than a deep, truthful, earnest, enduring interest in those who would be happy; who would live to a purpose, who would have horhes here on earth, and glorious happiness in the beautiful Land of the Leal where we hope to rest some cay forever. Saturday Night!  and others are at rest. Perhaps in the hours' this night before the old week dies, we can write something which'ill make men and women happier, and homes happier, and loves stronger, and children stronger to live for a great and good purpose. Would to that GREAT FATHER we are not one bit afraid to meet, and who has given us such a full faith for a happy and useful future, we could talk as one would sit of an (xv)  &#xD;<pb n="xvi-17" xml:id="VAC7470-00000008"/> xvi         Introduction. ' evening and- converse by his fireside with friends dearly loved, and in whom real interest is felt, - to all the wives, the children, the working-men of the land. But this we cannot do. And so, faithful pen, with which we have written more than a thousand of columns, and millions of words, will you aid us in a little work each Saturday Night? They tell us you are mightier than the sword; and we believe it. Therefore we choose you as our friend, and enlist you' in the work of' labor while others rest. And so sit we down to our labor.. With a heart warm and full of love to those who really wish to be good, and true,'and loving, and happy, we hold thee Heavenward, that the sunbeams of earnest interest from the beautiful spirit Home may rest on thy diamond point, and that good influences may be in our heart direct from those with whom we hold such sweet .communion, that the words we write -on the coffin-lid of the dying week may make better those to whom this heart-written volume is dedicated. And do not, good home ones who sit by hearth and fender; who know the depth and purity of earnest love; who with us are often weary, think ill of us for this plain, homely writing. We would not dictate, nor compel you to think with us. But we would see you all happier, and deem it no wrong nor cause for shame to sit down while others rest, to write from the heart of an earnest man, who has known grief, sorrow, labor, struggle, privations, and success, kind words to all, and especially to the ones to whom this volume is dedicated for reading on all the morrows, as we begin this our earnest home-work Saturday Night.  Thine for the Right,  M. A.  POMERO0y.   I. SITTIG SIDE BY SIDEr. THE Rain! the Rain! How it patters on the panes, runs down in rivulets, as if the windows were sorry and in tears! Our work for the week is well- nigh finished -perhaps the work of our life will be -finished this Saturday Night. &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7470-00000009"/> 18     Our Saturday Nights. for the loved ones will patter like rain-drops on strained and grief-crimsoned hearts. How the old memories are recalled by inci- dents! Near a score of years ago! How time comes and is lost in the mist of the past! In a room not so large nor so nicely furnished as this. No gas-burners holding back the curtains of darkness, but a simple lamp. It was Saturday Night. She sat right there--on a little ottoman. We sat right here, as it seems. Never a picture so idistinct. It rained; and the drops danced and spattered as they were storm-whirled against the panes in that blessed country home. She sat there, we here. It was not far from here to there, nor does it seem an hour since thus we sat. And yet it must be. Men cannot suffer so much in an hour I           t She was beautiful. Her eyes were unlike any others we ever saw. She talked with them, and every word was in spirit-melody, "I love you, darling." Do you wonder memory is faithfull?   Sitting Side by Side.     19 Her hands were in ours. They were such soft, white little hands, who could help kissing them? We thought them   the most beautiful in the world. And her eyes-they talked to us so eloquently! And her lips--none like them in all God's creation. Purity, fervor, love, sweet- ness, devotion, confidence. Earnest trusting and quiet heart-rest-'these were the unwritten volumes her lips told as we read, from their red readiness, while the rain pattered much as now. Years, years, years; but still that night! We sat and talked as others have and as others will. The sky was cloud-covered, but not- our hearts. It was very, very dark without, and the storm howled as if in envious anger at the picture within, and spent its spattering venom on rill- coursed panes in vain. What we talked of, or how long, we cannot itell-yet we can. It was of the past which seemed so short-the present which was so bright for all the darkness outside -the long-coming future across the broad waves of which we launched many little boats, and were  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7470-00000010"/> 20     Our Saturday ffigqts. very happy to see them sailing away to distant isles we had been told were 'way out in the ocean of the future, and to be found by somebody! The isles existed only in that direction, yet some folks send their ships in all directions! And the farther they sail the further therefrom. Alas! there are many ships idly cruising, wrongly mated, never nearing the beautiful groves of the sea, but at last sinIcing from sight while the waves roll on, and other boats or ships sail over that spot perhaps to sink just beyond! But we thought of these things while the rain pattered and the wind in gustful fever raged without. So close she was to us. Yes --hand and heart-lip and life. "How the wind blows and the trees wail! Is it not a fearful night?" "Yes : are you not afraid?" "Afraid? No, darling; for you are here." She wore no diamonds, nor was her garb of silk. We had no houses, lands, or wealth, but d   Sitting Side by Side.       21 never was boy or man so rich. Her eyes seemed like portals of Heaven, from which came most wondrous light of love, and not gentler ever was nod of beautiful flower than the silent, soul- sealing kiss on forehead then so gentlyegiven. No matter how wild the storm, how dark the night. Hearts that are truly heart-warmed never feel the outside cold or pang of poverty.  . It is late. The storm is over. My darling  must rest. As the storm  has gone, and the stars are coming, so will troubles go and joys come   if we but live for the within, but not in selfishness. Closer and still closer. Yes, very soon will we   come. And, now, darling, this kiss,- "Good-night, loved one, good-nigt! But ere from thee we part, Take this one kiss of love - good-nigt t/ It tells how dear thou art." The   morrow came  . . .  They found  her asleep  The little hand was on the pillow;   the  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7470-00000011"/> 22      Our Saturday Nights. once red, now pale cheek rested on her hand;      :i the lips parted as if to smile. So they found her when came the morrow; so they told us. But she slept in a little narrow coffin. The physi- cian said She passed away instantly, from over excitement of the heart.                I "Good-night, loved one, good-night / But ere from thee we part, Take this last kiss on earth - good-night!    It tells how deax thou art."          -Many the Saturday Night have we sat by a little grave looking into the eyes which live forever. And she ever seems to us as then, and we even say,-                    , Yes, very soon we will come ;           l And when the wild   wind  roars and the  storm-fiends hold revels in  air; when  the great drops patter on leaf and rock; when the trees in the forest near by bend in terror, toss their limbs, and seek to prostrate them- Ii i   Sitting Side by Side.    23 selves before the Power of the elements; when others sit by little fires or side by side, we love to sit there by that hallowed spot, and talk with her as of yore. She is not dead. Ah, no! She was too young-she is at school with God, waiting our coming. And for years we have been ready, and mayhap we can go home some Saturday Night like this.

When the work comes for us to do, we do it, just as we told her we would. That Saturday Night we were very poor in all- save hope and pluck, and it is hard to lift sympathy away from such as the good, the loved, and the trusting as that night sat with us while the rain beat -as when we began this chapter. These rain- storms are stepping-stones to the hallowed past, and they are laden with the resolves and promises made that night before the Great Eternal. And but for others we would wish that there would- come a beating rain and a storm on whose wings we could ride to ]neet her, and in honor. of whose memory we write a little chapter under her angel influ- ence each Saturday Night.   II LrrTLE Tnr PAILS. OD bless the little tin pails! To-night we saw them going home,- a thousand and more of them. They were carried by men who toil-by the working- men, who are sneered at, and snubbed, and jostled against, and pushed aside by the gilt- edge fashionables whose hands are soft and (25)  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7470-00000013"/> 26     Our Saturday Nights. whose hearts are hard. The little tin pails went out this morning, and they went in to-night. The man who had one in his hand swinging by his side, was weary and foot-sore, just as we have been a thousand times, and no one to pity us, save the one who waited our coming, and the God who has pity for all who need. We saw the laborers go by this morning, their little pails full, their step quick and elastic; for it will not do for laboring men to be late! The rich, who carry furs and gold- clasp purses, and who patt their poodles, may be late or not go at all; but the honest man, with hard palms and an uncertain future-he must be on time. 'Way up stairs, down cel- lar; in the close, sticky, ropy, thickened air of the tenement house, where humanity is huddled like sheep, their little pails were filled. A wife arose while her tired husband was sleeping "just a moment more," and with silent step walked the floor till the scanty meal of the morning   Little Tin Pails.      27 was ready. Then she called him, and the tired man arose, wishing he did not have to go forth thus early. And while he ate hurriedly, the hand he once so loved to kiss filled that little pail. A slice or two of bread, a little cold meat, some salt and mustard, and perhaps a piece of pie or cake; mayhap an egg, or cold potatoe; and perchance, in a little cup on top the pail, a pint of coffee. Then the knife and the spoon were slipped in, and he hurried away. Work, work, work! hour after hour. Think- ing of this and that; of the past, of to-day, of  to-morrow. Hammer, saw, pound, brush, stitch, file, drill, shovel, lift, watch, strain muscle and strain mind. Hours go by-noon comes. The little pail is welcome treasure. It comes at hour of rest, with its fill of food. The tired man eats, and he thinks of home- and the loving hands that filled his little pail, and his heart grows strong; and when the noon hour is over, he works and works, and he works for her and for them, and  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7470-00000014"/> 28     Our Saturday^ -ights. for a better home, and a time when to rest a day is not to rob the loved ones. And he looks back over the years to the time when he wondered if she love4 him, and to the Saturday Nights when he hurried home, and washed his face, and his hands, his neck, his body; when he put on his best, and no matter how tired, hastened to meet her, to see her, to put his hand in hers, to take one, two, three,-- a score of kisses from the lips- so loved, and to look, oh! so far down into the depths of the eyes which were his choicest mirrors.  She was young then. Now she is old or growing old. He- e works in the shop. She toils in the house, and, perhaps, goes out to labor, to help lim earn a home. M[onday - Tuesday - Wednesday - Thursday d-Friday- Saturday! Six  days of toil, of waitng, of  r   Working, , of doubting, of hard labor for the loved ones, and the life all prize. The little pails go and come, day after    Little Tin Pails.       29 day, till they build houses, stores, churches, towns, cities, countries! And they last often after those who carry them have gone home to the land of the leal, and the rest that knows no more disturbing. Up in shops, 'way up stairs and down  cellars, on the streets, along, the wharves, here, there, everywhere, they go and come, till they have worn out the laborer and enriched the employer. And the men who   carry them, and all who toil, are the ones who build the country and finish  the town. The miser looks at his gold or his bonds; the bondholderrides in his carriage, quaffs his wine, lolls back on his sofa, sports his jewelry, counts his bonds, figures on his income, pays no taxes, and lives like a lord. He builds no houses.   He erects no stores. He piles not one brick above another till a beautiful improvement be made; but he robs the little tin pail of all it earns, and empties the sweat it holds Saturday Night into the  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7470-00000015"/> 30     Our Saturday Nights. crucible of Congressional protection, then pours out perfumery for himself and his loved ones, who are mincy, and nobby, and stylish, and soft of palm; who wear silks, and catch their skirts in hand as they pass the little tin pail lest the robe of aristocracy be touched with honest spots. We do not like the mincing worshippers of poodles, and the ones -who sneer at the laborer and rob him of his earnings. For an hour we have seen them go by. Little tin pails, more precious and worthy than dia- mond necklaces. The ones who carry them seem tired, as we are tired from over-writing. God guide those who carry them to happy homes, and give the weary man a night of rest. And to him we say, God knowing we mean but good,- "Go home and rest. Hang the pail on its nail or stand it upon its shelf. Then draw off your boots, if the chores be done. Kiss your wife as you did years ago, when, on a Saturday Night,   Iittle Tin Pails.     31 you told her you loved her so dearly. Call back the love-light. 13e good and kind to her. Rest her palm in yours. Smooth back the hair from her brov, and hold her cheek to your neck as in days of the past. She has worked all the week, in her room-busy, busy, ever busy, for woman's work is never done. She has not had the company you have. - She has counted the hours, waiting your coming, for the home of the poor is sometimes lonely. Be kind to her, love   her, talk to her, read to her. Read this chapter to her, and tell her you, are trying to make your home and your loved ones happy.  Save your meney. Beautify your home, be it never so humble. Do not squander it for rum or in dissipation, to weaken your strength, shorten your days, and embitter the final hour.

AN EMPTY ITREARSE. went by not five minutes since. A black, cold-looking lonesome hearse, drawn by two sorry-looking horses, fol- lowed by two old-looking carriages, as it re- turned from the City of the Dead over yonder. The rain fell in a sort of drizzle, cold and'sick- ening, as the driver, wrapped in an old water- (40)   An Empty Hearse.       41 proof, bent his face to the storm and urged his team to a -little faster trot, as if anxious to get futher from the grave and to hasten. home to rest with his loved: ones. And the mourners were anxious to keep up,' and their steaming horses did. As the hearse passed, we saw  by the rollers on its floor-they were far apart-that a large coffin had rested thereon; and in the sanctum, when it was reached, we stopped writing to think. And in this wise ran our thoughts: That driver must have    a singular life. Every day  going  with his peculiar freight, each day the better learning the road to the spot he will in time reach, as well as any of his customers, no matter whether he ever saw the final city or the  road leading thereto! , Wonder if he ever counts his trips as he sits on lIis box waiting, and wondering what num- ber his last will be,--the trip but one way for him, two ways for the rest?  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7470-00000021"/> 42     OUT Saturday N'ights. And is it not a singular journey when a man must go alone? No guide! No, friend along to help kill time, for time has helped kill him. No asking how far to this station or that; in fact, no starting on the trip till hours after you have reached your final desti- nation! Who was it? We do not know. Millions do not know. Millions do not care-do not even care to care! The empty hearse dodges up Broadway,'of less account than a millc-cart. Somebody has gone home this Saturday Night, and the great world cares no more for the sorrow which rests -in the home once his than for the breeze which passed yesterday.- But there is a vacant spot in his home-a wound so deep in some heart or hearts, surely God must pity and heal! No matter how poor he was, somebody loved him. Perhaps he was sinful,-we all are,-yet somebody loved him and looked for his coming; and when the last   An Empty Hearse.       43 look came, and the unspoken  words died out as he died, and the last pressure of his hand, hard though the palm  might have been, was felt; and when his soul cut loose from earthly moorings to soar away to the infinite, then went the hot leaden plummet of sorrowr, oh! so deep into some heart, which may God pity. This death is a terrible thing to us; not be- cause it is death, but because it is the parting with life and from those who have grown into and all around our hearts as sunshine plays through branches and rests on flowers. For the future we have no fears. God is mercy and mercy is God. God is the concentration of Faith; and those who rest on IIim and  is promises never will fall or sink.

To die and be forgotten is something- yet it is nothing, for those who forget us will be nothinfg to us over there! To die and bid fare- well fo earth will be but ceasing to look upon a miserable sketch and feasting our eyes upon a more beautiful picture than man ever saw; to come like a bit of sunshine upon those who have gone before us to look upon it, and to be gladdened, when those who sincerely mourn come to tap us on the shoulder as we are gaz- ing on the beautiful, saying to us, with golden smiles and love-lit eyes: "Darling, I have come'!" But it is terrible to: die and know that you are dying. The loved  one or ones go and come.   The room  becomes tiresome.  The couch has no rest in it.

And to leave her!-    is th is the agony! Who will care for her as the one wVlo is dying? Another will in time, perhaps, and perhaps not; after the birds have twice twittered their vernal odes,--after the flowers have twice listened thereto,--some one else will be dear as you have been, and kiss the lips you would not now have him   kiss for all the world--for they are hers!

And then all the little keepsakes you prize will be emptied into some old box or into the fire, and she-will find no joy in the little things which once were so prized by both as dotti ngs left by happy passing hours. And this is agony to those who love. And it is agony to think that, perhaps, no one else will care for your loved ones as' you did, and that they may suffer some day.

Their tears will fall, and we know it. Not mock tears, but real ones, bursting lp from the heart, for a friend will have gone.

And all the little things, trifles in themselves, but volumes each, will be - tossed aside.

The wind howled  like some watch-dog from the infernal,  hunting 'for one absent. Signs creaked as they swung, and rich men on the street hurried by with fiur-wrapped ears and well-gloved hands. All the week gone but this. An hour more (50)   Home on a Shutter.      51 labor and we will close the business desk, and finish the week with a Saturday Night article.

Five o'clock and thirty minutes by the great clock up there over the City Hiall: later than we thought, so we hurry across Chatham and up Centre.

Over his face is thrown a well-worn coat lie used to wear.

"Who is he"  "Michael O'Brien, sir. He was just killed, sir." "How, and where!" "He was working with us, sir, down on Pearl Street, on a new building, when a cap- stone gave way, sir, and took poor Michael in its fall; and never a word spoke he since. And we are takin' him home to his wife and children, and it's a sorry night they'll have of it, for they loved him so!" And with the four went another to lend a hand to those in need. Went to a worlring- man's home on another street. Into the door, up two flights, slowly--slowly, for the stair- way is very narrow. "What is the matter " "Open the door wider, for it is all sorrow we bring. Steady, men--on that chair- on   Hrome on a Shutter.     53 this--softly, now.

All the week he t6iled, as we learned, early and late. A strong, honest, healthy man, worlding to better -his home and make his loved ones happy. His hands were hard, but he was good. He was unused to sharp trickls, to speculations, to legalized robbing; he was simply a working-man, and his loss is not felt! Not felt! God' above us! The capstone that fell and crushed his life was a million times lighter than the loss she bears or the sorrow she knows! He was but a laborer. He toiled all day. He earned of dollars but few, but he earned them, and that is better than to steal themn. He was but one man among many, but he was   Hiome on a Sl/utter.     55 a man, a husband, a father. He lived in no palace, but he had a happier home to go to nights than  many a man of wealth. Hour after hour he- worked. Stone after stone he hauled up. His mark was' left on many a spot where men of labor leave their marks. But now he has gone. No band will follow him to the grave; no long line of empty carriages filled with men chatting of horses, of bonds, of houses, of wine, of women, of nothing, will follow him home but loving hearts will mourn for him, for he deserves tears. Fold and put away his clothes.  Put back that plate; leave back the knife, fork, and spoon; no more set his chair to the table, for he has gone home where there are no Saturday Nights terrible as this is to the mourners.

Think of his kind words, his good acts; think of the good he did while he lived; forget the hasty words, the unkind ones, if ever he spoke them. And you who have to-night the forms of loved ones in your homes waiting for the tomb, God pity you. And you who do not have death with you to-night, may you not have it for years to come. Welcome the tired ones as they come from the shop. Give them a kiss and a kind word. Malie home pleasant, and call to its sacred reach the loved ones.

If the rich would treat those who labor better, the world would be the gainer, and therefore do we ask those who are favored by fortune and unjust laws, when they go home, to give a thought to the poor ones, the weeping and heart-broken ones, who are always with us, and oftener more deserving than those who pass them by with a sneer from Monday morn till Saturday Night  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7470-00000029"/> wliAT jT11 to Before the sun went home this Satur- day Nighlt to tell God who had striven the hardest for heaven the week past, a mil- lionaire rode 'by.

And she welcomes- us Sat- urday Night, and every night; and her pure, true, trusting, and- beautiful love keeps us from wandering. Add we sit by our little fire, hand in hand. Diamonds never threw light as do the eyes of our darling, for they light from soul to soul, malking noonday of otherwise night. And she gives us, ohl! such tempting welcome. No servants are near tolisten and tell. The rattle of playtlhings on the floor disturbs us not, for we knew it, and 'twas as God intended.

Sitting in an easy-chair, watching the burning coke in the grate making faces, and half-listening to conversation, we were thinking of the poor ones who had no easy- chairs and cheery fires. The door opened   About a Little Girl Whose Name is Lulu. 67 slowly; with hesitating step there entered a young girl of eleven years. "Please, do you want to buy some hooks and eyes?' "No, I guess not," said a gentleman, who was busy in another part of the room. "Please, I sell them very cheap, and my mother is very poor." And while he was calling., the attention of the good-hearted lady of the house, we took up the conversation: "Come here, little girl." And she came,--a sweet-faced, modest lit- tie thing, in her hand a little paper box. "What have you to sell?" "Iooks and eyes, and a belt-buckle." "Not much of stock, have you?" "No, sir, not much; for we are too poor." "How do you sell them?" "-Five cents a card."  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7470-00000034"/> 68     O'ur Saturday Nightts.

She was a pretty little child,--her eyes seeming just like the eyes of a dear little pet who calls us papa, and kisses us such loving welcome, and whose years are no more thlan the little one's before us. "Come here, little one." And she came and stood beside her6 sister. Who could help puttings his arm  around her little innocent form, and drawing her closer to him? She had no silks, but her face 'tnd eyes were enough to win any heart. "Come, sit on our knee. Now, tell me all about it. What is your name?"   About a little Girl Whose N3ame is Lulu. 69 "Lulu. "That is a pretty name. I like it. Where is your papa?". "He was killed in the army, in a battle." "Where is your mother?" "She lives in a room  on East Eleventh Street, sir."- "What does she do?"

"How much have you sold?"--to the sister. "Thirty-five cents, sir, with what you paid me." "Quite a trade. Now, I want a card of hooks and eyes to comb my hair with, and a belt buckle to put on my wrist." The little girl said it was funny, and sold us the articles, when the conversation was re- sumed : "What does your mother sew on?" "She embroiders and makes aprons and lit- tle things for any one who wants her to." "Is she very poor?" "Yes, sir; we didn't have any bed, nor stove, nor furniture, when we moved in where we live now."              i   About a Little Girl TWlose Name i Lzulu. 71 "When was that?" "This winter."

"Please, sir, I have no clothes good enough to wear. But mamma will get me some, some day, and I wont look so ragged, and can go.-" "Can you read?." "Yes, sir, in the third reader." "Well, Lulu, tell your mamma when she is ready to send you to school to have you come here, and I will buy you all the lit- tle clothes you want for one year, for you put me in mind of another little girl." And the good lady where we were that evening said also,--  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7470-00000036"/> 72     Our Saturdeay Nights. "Yes, Lulu, he will do it, for he said he would; and I'll make you a nice little hat to wear." And two little tears came into her eyes as she tried to say, "Thank you." Looking upon a fruit-basket filled with oranges on a centre-table, we wondered if she had had any lately, and asked,- 'Have you had any oranges lately?" "Yes, sir; a gentleman gave me one a good while ago." "Here is money to bliy a nice one for your brother, your sister, and your mamma, and yourself."

And she told us,--a few doors east of Second Avenue, on Eleventli Street, just oppo- site a neat little bakery, where she could get the cakes. Putting on hat and overcoat, with the two little ones we went down stairs from the cheerful room into the street, to find, first the bakery, then the mother. And the little ones told us how their papa was killed in battle; how they once had a plenty. And little Lulu said God was the best friend she had, and her mother next. She said God would always care for the poor if they would- trust him, and that she prayed to him every night. And she went to Smiday-school, and tried to be a good little girl. - Here was perfection of faith; and we could not help thinking that the blessed Jesus, when on earth, could not help saying, "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven."  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7470-00000037"/> 74,     Our Saturday 2ights. We found the bakery, and a pleasant-voiced woman waiting on customers therein. Then we crossed directly over the street into a tenement house, and, guided by the little ones, found the room where they lived. And we found a middle- aged women, worn with care. But she was good -her eyes and her face and her words told it. She made aprons and all such work. And she told us, a stranger, that once she lived in Lodi, Seneca County, New York; that her husband was a music-teacher. And then she told us that he went South for his health; was drafted into -the Southern army, and killed in battle. Then she came North, destitute of all save her little ones and faith in God. Then we asked Lulu to bring us an apron for a lady the next afternoon at five o'clock, and went out into the busy street, and from there to meet in council brethren of the mystic tie. And all the night we were in dreamland; 'and pure-eyed little girls were, with tears in their eyes,   About a little Girl Whose Name is Lulqu. 75 trying to say "Thank you," or were nestling by our side. The -next day we left the city for the West, two hours earlier than we intended, and did not see Luln. But she did not forget us, as the following extract from a letter will show: "251 EAST THRTEENTH STREET, t NEW YORK CITY, April 13. * * '  "Little Lulu came promptly at five o'clock, with a beautiful apron made expressly for you and in her sweet little hand a pink she had bought for you. She felt quite disappointed at not seeing you. 'But Lizzie bought the apron for you and appropriated the pink.

It is a simple little story we have told above, exactly as it occurred, as any one can learn. And from our other city in the West, we write, wondering where is the little Lulu, and if her faith in God is still the sahme. And we thinlk of the thouesands and tens of thousands that are of God's poor who are uncared for. Children of working-men and worling-women; little orphans, who never know of parental love; little wander- ers to eternity, who have no one to buy them oranges, cakes, dolls, playthings, or keepsakes. In thought to-night we have been far away, looking into tenement houses; into garrets, cel- lars, and hovels; into little beds in orphan asy- lums; looking into the faces of the poor and the innocent who battle daily with fate. How few there are who  know how others suffer--few there are who care. God bless the Christian mother who  suffers; who taught her little ones to pray, and who is winning a crown to, wear in the beautiful Eternal Land. -J/   About a Little Girl Whose 2Name is Lulu. " And we have all the night been- thinking 'of the ones who profess to be Christians and to care for their fellow-men; who spend thousands of dollars for fashionable churches, cushioned pews, swell ministers, and solid silver or gold commun- ion service. Little do they care for the poor and the needy. Their eyes look up the tall steeples they have built, but seldom down to the bare feet and ragged garments of the "tears of God" that plead for care and notice. We love the poor and do not care for the rich. We have no money for spires with gilded domes, or tinkling inven- tions to suspend therein, nor for high-priced pews, with elastic backs'and velvet trimmings. Time enough for these when we turn hppocrite and from softness of- brain try to deceive Deity by studying a fashion book rather than kneeling before Him in earnest, secret prayer. Be kind to the poor! They have few friends on earth--especially if they be white. God made them white; they are not to blame!

They visit -caucuses, visit election places, visit political meetings, but have no time to dry tears or mellow the hearts of -those who need sympathy. To all the mothers, we say, "Have faith." And to all our little friends, who read this, those words : ' Think how good your fathers and moth- ers are to you, and rejoice that you have a home and some one to love you, and always speak kindly to the poor, even if you can give nothing to make them happier, and we shall be glad to know that if we have done no good, at: least we have done no harm or wrong this Saturday Night. S   SURCH A LITTLE COFFIN! YT was not twice the length of the sheet of  paper on which we write this article! A little coffin-a little bit of a coffin, not large enough to contain half the! playthings a little girl we know of has to amuse herself with.  It was not a casket, or burial case with silver  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7470-00000040"/> 80     Our Saturday Nights. handles, white satin, silver fringe, and glass sky- light to the home of the departed. All these are for the rich men-the bondholders, whose chil- dren are said to be better than the little children of working-men. It was simply a little plain coffin made from black walnut, and it was being carried into a house on Canal Street as we walked home this Saturday Night, very weary, from our work. No one else noticed it. A poor man came to the door when the undertaker rang the bell. He looked sad and lonely, just as thousands we know would look if a little coffin should be wanted  in their homes to-night! Hundreds hurried  by.; who,of them  thought of the- mourners? Slowly we walked home. Somebody was in the depths of sorrow. Who it was we knew not. We could not keep from thinking, and after supper we went back to the house and rang the   Such a Little Coffin!     81 bell. The man, with a sad face, came to the door. '"Good evening, sir. Can a stranger, who means well, be of service to you?" "Oh! thank you; but it is not much a stranger or a friend can do. Who are you? Why come you here? We have never met." "Simply a friend. I have nothing to do; I saw the little coffin come in; perhaps I can do some good-and I felt like coming. That is all." "Oh, sir, you are welcome! But it is all sadness here now. Come this way." And we walked into a little room where the little coffin was. A little boy, not four years -born, rested there. The coffin was on a table. The sweet little face, so waxen and fair, did not seem like death, but for the little rosebud beside the pale temple. The great, big tears came down so fast over the broyw face of our-  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7470-00000041"/> 82     Our Saturday Nights. friend,-for, if in trouble he was our friend,- as he said,-- "He was our only treasure, and we did so love him." "Where is his mother?" "She is sick, sir,--worn out with nervous excitement,--and is in our room, almost heart- broken." And we found her weeping bitterly, and as we sat by the side of the lounge on which she reclined, we could only say, "Illdeed, I am very, very sorry for you." And we saw a little pin on his bosom, till then unnoticed. "Are you a Mason " "I am, or I try to be one." "Well, brother, the light in the East is still bright; those are the most favored who are earliest called from labor to refreshment. Just a little- coffin. No one would notice it in a city like this. The hearse passes along, a   Such a Little Coffin!     83 few carriages try to keep up as the driver hurries through the tangled teams and over horse-car tracks. Then he stops, a jam  of carriages is formed, and a policeman says, in a coarse voice, "Move  on,  move  on!"  He  might have seen it was but a little coffin and spoken a little more kindly. No one could have spoken so harshy who mourned.  The omnibus with its load, hurried by; a carriage, filled with laughing ladies, hurried by, and those on its cushioned seats never cared to look at the, little coffin even for one little minute. A  drayman saw what it was -and kindly waited a moment; his eyes seeming to say, "I am  sorry for some- body." And so they bore it away 'over the river. The hearse on the ferry-boat stood beside a market wagon, on which the driver sat whistling an opera air. A dandy-looking swell stood with cane in hand, one foot on the hub of the hearse, looking with half-satisfied eye on the  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7470-00000042"/> 84     Our Saturday Nights. pretty ankle of a girl who was leaning and looking over the railing of the boat. The coffin was not so small as the anlle, but he could not see it. And when we reached the other side, all hurried off.- The crowed jammed, and men swore. Some went this way, some that. We never saw their faces before, as we remember -never shall again'! But somebody will see them some day. They will be in coffins, looking up to Him who sees little coffins as well as big ones. If this had been a big one; if there had Keen four horses with nodding plumes, a silver- immed casket, instead of a plain little coffin, a long string of carriages, half-empty,-- folks would have asked who it was that was thus keeping ahead of us, and at tea-tables would have told the news. And folks would have asked how much money he had left; that is, how much good he might have done but did, not! But it was only a little coffin; three carriages   Such a Lzttle Corfin      85 followed it; it was the child of a working man, but, with it, to God, went the grief-stricken hearts of those who mourned because their only joint treasure had been called home. Never mind. He who is so good is the great never- dying echo of "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them  not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven."  And He will always welcome the little ones to him, kiss the tears from the eyes of those who mourn, and send themn back to life's duties, while He cares for the jewels in that Heaven we all hope for. Only a little coffin! Who ever thinks of them? Little caskets contain the most precious treasures. The buds are promises of flowers; and when the ;bud is taken we mourn, for we do not know but it might have become the most beautiful flower of all. God pity those who have, with tear-wet eyes looked upon little coffins. The hope of the father and the mother, the one who has so  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7470-00000043"/> 86     Our Saturday Nfigts. often been kissed  and carressed, is no more. The hearts of those. who brought it thus far are dark with grief. And down into the little grave buried with that little coffin, go a thousand hopes, dreams, castles, ideas,' and linls, connect- ing us with and drawing us on to the future. Indeed, few there are who know how much the little coffins hold! The agony of the mother who has once before suffered; the fears of the father who held her head, and by her pillow watched, with kind touch and gentle kiss; the hours of quiet talk over the future of the new guest to love's table; the hopes, fears, watch- ings, care and affection God gives us for the little ones,-all are packed into .that coffin, till it seems as if He must love the little one just come to Him for the years of heart and hopes dashed to pieces, which come like prayers of mourners beseeching -His eternal care. Little coffins. Little caskets.   Such a Little Coffn!     87 Little treasures. Chrysalis and Butterfly. Promise and Re- ward. Buds here, flowers there. Little graves here, little crowns there. , The little coffins are dear, for there we gave to rest our little and our loved ones. And where they sleep are little hillocks, which also mark the wounds on our hearts. And the little hillocks will last after we have gone to the Eternal Land, where only can our wounds be healed! And the little hillocks are everywhere,--city and town, cemetery and graveyard, - crowded together, and singly, they are to  be found. And when we see them    in the quiet cities of the dead, we feel sorry for those who there hid from sight the little coffins, and say, 'way down deep in our heart, God bless and make happy the little ones there at rest, and all who mourn that they are not with us, who so loved them, and carried to them presents, and love, and kisses, and kind words every Saturday Night.

And to-night we relate a little incident, not much of itself, but volumes for all.

I work in a foundry on -- Street. I read your article about little tin pails, and all the men in the shop heard Ine read it at noon.

We are working-men; our hands are hard - and grimed, but our hearts are warmer than many who sneer at us. The sledge, the file, the sand, the hot iron and the cold, leave their marks on us, but we think, anld work, and think. And when a man speaks for us we love hit. "-But it- is not of this to-night. You have troubles of your own--all have. But I wish to tell you I work hard and try to save. I love my wife. Years ago, when she was younger than now, I loved her; and I have always tried to make her happy. We had no home then, as we have now. I worked and earned our home; these hands and   these   Kil  Words from Womnan's Lips.   91 muscles earned it. It is not a rich home, but it is ours, and sometimes very happy. "Sometimes when I go home I am     very tired. It is hard work to labor as we have to. And some days I am  sick and tired, and my head aches, and my bones ache, and I do not feel strong. But I work, for we must eat. Her and the babes must eat and be clad. And  I   go  home  tired. And sometimes she is gla'd to see me, and sometimes she is cross and scolds. She says I do not love her, when I do. And she seems not to care for me And she speaks hot, sharp, bitter words. They would not hurt if others said them, but when they come from her lips, I feel sick and tired of life. I try to be good and kind, and mean to do right. All the way from the shop, I wonder if she will be kind or cross when I reach home.

We do not know who that poor fellow is, whose honle is hardly reached; but he is somebody. He had a mother, and how her heart would have mourned to have seen him thus! Perhaps it is to his, mother's house he is going. Perhaps to his own home, if a drunkard's place of liv- ing can be called a home. If to a wife and children that policeman is leading him, God pity them. Doubtless he has worked all the week. Most likely some good fellow, who is kind, and gentle, and loving, when sober. But now, what is he? A poor, weak, helpless man, unable to care for himself. A  sorrow and shame to his loved ones, a disgrace to himself. We do not know how much money it cost him to win this prize. But it cost something. Perhaps a dollar. Perhaps less. Better have thrown the money away and kept his manhood. Better have given his dimes to the little beggar children.

And we saw that men loved to be in attractive places. And for fear we would be sick and without money we worked. And to make our home attractive we saved our earnings, till at last we made a sanctum more beautiful than any room we ever saw, and people asked how we did it. By  saving our ealmings and putting the money'we might have spent in dissipation, in pictures, paintings, carpets, desks, sofas, tables, curtains, and little works of art. Thus we gave employment to working-men. We purchased the -result of others' labor with the result of our own.  We  encouraged mechanics and art- workers, made our home attractive. Every dol- lar thus invested helped make a  wall between us and dissipation.

How short it has been! seven days- seven chapters of light and happiness, of joys and sorrows, of hopes and fears, of trials and conquests, of births and marriages, of sickness and of health. But a little thing is a week; but it is a life to some, in the results it doth bring/ (105)  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7470-00000053"/> 106    Our Saturday Nights. To-night we were made to feel sad, yet happy.- On the way home we passed a woman in calico, leading by the arm a weak, tottering, trembling old man. His step was hardly a step; he could hardly lift his feet from the pavement; his face was wrinkled with the lines of ninty-one winters, while his scattered hairs were silky and white as the purest snow. And the woman was past the fifty. Her face was kind; her eyes told volumes. The crowd on the Bowery turned aside as it hurried by to let the old man toddle on. "Good evening, good woman; call we help. you . " "Oh, no, thank you!"And she looked so kindly at us. "We are almost home-a few steps farther; and you are in a hurry,- going home too, perhaps.' Almost Home! Yes, the old man, who little heeded the crowd, and who looked with mazed- and puzzled gaze on o .    Worth of Vomaw's Love.    107 the busy scene, was almost home! A few more Saturday Nights and he will be there with him, and then he can walk, and run without stumbling or other support than his. And we passed on, to think, and think. And we thought of woman's love, and the worth of it. How she cared for himt-we should think her father. Perhaps he was cross and petulant years ago, if not now; yet she was kind to him, and with care steadied his steps lest he fall and the busy crowd trample him under feet. And we thought of thousands and thousands of good women in different places, who love, are good, and true, and pure, and kind; who deserve happiness here and Heaven hereafter. All over the land we saw them as we walked home. The entire line -of clouds seemed to be rolled back Byrme great hand as somebody said, "Look at them everywhere." And we did look into thousands of homes, by the farmer's fire, and in the woodman's cabin  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7470-00000054"/> 108     Our, Sat2urdy Nights. by the sick bed and kneeling with grief-laden hearts and tear-wet faces, beside corpses and coffins. - We saw them in calico and homespun by thousands, and they all told of woman's worth, love, and devotion. Little do men know of woman's sorrows, heart- aches, hungerings for love, temptations, and, re- sistings. Men go and come. They are busy. Avenues of labor and amusement are opened to them, for they have power to open to suit them- selves. They plunge into business, engage in en- terprises, hunt, fish, sport, idle, dissipate, go and come, mixing, talking, eager to be interested. When tired, they rest; but woman's work is never done, and she must labor on, a prisoner within close walls, like a caged bird seeing the world but not mixing therewith lest she be lost. We know of a home where a woman works clieerfully, for he she loves works like us.' She wears calico, and knows nothing of opera.- Her heart is in her home, her' loved ones; she is   Worth of Woman's Love.     109 happy, for they all live for her as she does for them. And oh, the wondrous depth of her love! She is by the bedside, the table, the chair, every- where. She is monarch of home--queen of hearts; and willing tributes do her subjects pay. Her hand stills pain; her lips greet with such pure, earnest, loving kisses! Her words are ever so kind and gentle while her life is not lost in selfishness. She is not a vain beauty, cold as marble, indifferent to others, caring only for herself, for position and the outward adornment of her person,- tyrannizing over hearts compelled by the ukase of society to pay vows where none are due. But she is a good woman--a loving woman. A loving, affectionate, gentle, caressing woman a man always loves, and is willing to care for, protect and defend. We   love a godd, warm-hearted woman. Not one of these simple beauties who are gay, paint- ed, padded, befrixed and befrizzled adornings of fashion, without heart or true worth. Such are  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7470-00000055"/> "O    Our Saturday Nights. very nice to look upon, good to flirt with, nice to take to the opera, the races, the theatre, or to skirmish with when the coast is clear and willing ones seek for adventure, but they don't wear for keeps like the good, plain, sensible women who have hearts and whose worth is more than pen or tongue can tell. Women would be better and happier if men loved them better and were more true. to them. If men would strive as much to make home happy as they do to seek happi- ness elsewhere; the world would be better. Hours do come when men admit the power the worth of woman. Not in sunshine so much as in shade and storm. When engrossed with business and rolling on the sea of such cess, we too often forget the ones without whom life would be a blank, and only fly to the havens and shelters, the love and gentle caresses of woman, when the waves are high and to remain abroad is to perish.   Worth of Woman's  Love.   1" Then comes the hour when all admit the power of the weak. It is the care of woman which makes millions of homes beautiful, and makes love's palaces of laborers' cabins and farmers' cottages. It is the love we have for woman, -- the love they have for us as men, - that drives us ahead to conquests and victories. The words kindly spoken, the smile of those we love, the commendation of those we res- pect of women, make men of all who are not debased, and draw our hearts to them  with irresistible power. And as we see them day after day patiently, earnestly toiling to help others- walk; as we see them leading the weak, aiding the unfortunate, and by the wondrous power of their God-given love, and the magic of their smiles, caresses, and prayers, we wonder that all men do not pay more tribute to the worth of woman's love. Theirs is not the forum nor the hustings. We do not love those who strive for mascuo  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7470-00000056"/> "2    Our Saturday Nlrightst. linity.

He might have been an enemy; perhaps a friend. He came at one hour, we' at another. He arose early, we late. , He rode or walked one way, we another. "Did he have a family?"How do we know?

We mind ours, and never quarrel. Yet, for all this, we at times wonder who lives next door; how he lives, for whom, and why. And we wonder were they really mourners or heart swindlers who attended the funeral next door? If we could only look in there sometimes! But then they might look in upon us! - ow would we like that? And so we live in the city, known and yet not known, knowing ,and not knowing, friends and not friends; each intent upon his or her own business, not caring whether there be parties for joy or for grief, parties for business or pleasure, parties for revelling or mourning, so near us. But   Funeral Next Door.     119 this we do know: there was a funeral next door to us, and some of these days we, too, shall be called home, and they who so near yet not so near, will, as we have done,. look out the window to notice there is a funeral next door, and to mention it perhaps, if not during the week, when shall come Saturday Night.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7470-00000060"/> XIII.

So the dispatch read in the paper this morning announcing a collision on the Central Railroad. Only two laborers-! But wait a moment. Who   Only Two Laborers Killed.   121 were these laborers? The trains met; there was a crash; the passengers escaped unhurt, and the only ones sent or called home were two laborers. The train passed on. Passengers talked and chatted. They read books and papers, played cards, or slept. Loved ones behind them or be- fore them, waiting their returning or coming, Only two laborers killed-! Who were they? What were they? Where were- they? No names given-no thought. Had one of Vanderbilt's trotting horses died or been killed, the telegraph and the papers would have told full particulars; for is not the horse of a rich man of more account than the life of a laborer? A simple-minded, honest, toiling laborer? Who was he? We will tell you. He was a poor working-man. Day after day he toiled, early and late.

He was passed by as of less account than the little smile of a pretty girl or bewitching woman. But he was a man. Years ago he was an in- fant, and rested, as do the children of others, in loving arms. There was joy at his coming years ago. There were prayers of a loving mother for his health, happiness, and escape from tempta- tion. But where the mother is now we cannot tell; for he was but a laborer, and in the eyes of the rich they are not worth mentioning, except as cooks, washers, ironers, menders, or old women. Are they not the most blessed who die young? Yes, she loved him, and wept when he went into the world. And her prayers followed him to protect, and he became a laborer rather than a loafer or a criminal, forgetting God and mother alike. And he toiled; and in time he lovedjust as we love.

That book he liked to read; that picture he looked at; the little presents his love-filled heart prompted giving to you, the keepsakes moss-covered with tender memories, he will never look at or talk over with you as you sit side by side; for his work is finished, he is at rest, and you who mourn are the ones we pity, and God knows how earnestly.

Thank God the rich, who hold our notes as bonds which we must pay, cannot keep us from loving each other, nor from paying tribute to trusting hearts. Nor can they keep the ones who labor from loving each other truly, if their hands be hard, homes poor, and raiment scant.

It is but sinking to rest in our office, when wearied 'with the labors of 'the day, and waking at home, where about us will stand, in the sunshine of God's wondrous love, the dear ones gone before- to prepare -the parlor of Eternity for our use and our resting, forever! And who 'would fear to thus sleep--to. lay by the pen, to shove back from the desk, and say, "Good-by, weary- ing labors;- we part forever;" to recline the head on back of cushioned chair, to smile as   -SinkiE g to Rest.    131 our eyes see the loved ones waiting, and to know that instead of walkling we are wafted silently and on wings of love, lest we waken before the glad surprise! Working-man  and brother! we care not what your language, or how much you differ from us in opinion, to you we talk to-night. Opinions are but opinions. We may be wrong, you may be wrong; each of us may be wrong; -for none but God is right. You have a right to your ideas, we have a right to ours; for they are all born of a higher power, to be operated on by acts, events, and arguments. But we would add to your happiness here. Another will care for you in the Hereafter, as He will care for all of us. You teach us, by your daily example, nmaniy things. We see you nobly striving, and would help you, if such thing can be. We all seek happiness. Let us see how it can be had. You are tired. Then rest.

Talk of the beauties of the past' you have seen, and con- gratulate yourselves that so much misery which has befallen others has escaped you. No matter how hard your lot, some one has a harder one. Think if there are not near you those you would not, on any account, change places with. If you love, love more. If you hate, hate less. Life is too short to spend in hating any one. Why war against a mortal who is going the same road with us - Why not expand the flower of life and happiness, by learning to love, by teaching those who are near and dear the beautiful lesson? Your hands may be hard, but your hearts need not be! Your forms may be bent or ugly, but do you not know that the most beautiful flowers often grow in the most rugged, unsheltered places    Sinking to Rest.     133 The palace for care,he e cottage for love. Not that there is no love in the mansion; but somehow, if we are not very careful, business will crowd all there is of beauty out of the heart. This is why God has given us Sab- baths and Saturday Nights, that we may leave business in the office, and have a heart-clean- ing. Forgive, as you would be forgiven. Love as you would be loved. Do as. you would be done by. Suppose you were a weary prisoner at home, and think how welcome would be the coming of her you love, to be with you one night, if not each night, and go by the places of dissipation, of wickedness, where people would not so congregate if they did not forget! If, you would have home happy, try to make it so. Light the lamp of life and keep it filled with the oil of love, care, affec- tion, tenderness, and caresses, that it may not go to sleep in the dark when the work of life  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7470-00000067"/> 134    Our Saturday  rights. is ended. Children often fear to go to sleep in the dark; but there is another sleep, and a- more terrible darkness! Only this, and nothing more! Suppose we fall asleep in the office this Saturday Night, and, neglecting to have trim- med our lamp, awaken to find but darkness and gloom  and uncertainty? We may find matches, but of what avail if there be no oil? We may die and live again; but if there be no lamps of love to lighten-our future, better that we lived, even in sorrow. Home can be happy if we make it so. Do. not expect to cull all the flowers. Do not, simply to please yourself! We repeat: do not, simply to please yourself; for therein .lies the-shroud of happiness? Give as is given. Keep back the bitter words. Others may be weary   and -etter. Words unspoken are never remembered! Go home to- night. If you would be happy,   Sinking to Rest.      135 go home. If there is Ao happiness there, take some and kindle more. 'Save your earnings. Beautify   your resting-places. Keep  your heart warm  and  your brain steady. Save rather than waste, for the days go by faster than we dream, and want may overtake us, as it has others who lost the week in the great whirlpool of Saturday Night. - 2Ft  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7470-00000068"/> O- -'W P STANDIG BEFORE THE MNISTER.

No army of waiters, bridesmaids, musicians, ushers; no saloon and lunch-room in the back parlor; no grand splurge as if no one had married before! But there were, it seemed to us, angels in the air, as, hand in hand, they stood before the minister, with eyes looking down as if to see the heart, they said "Yes," and with beautiful faith in the future began the wondrous voyage on that ocean thick with wrecked hopes and life's rinsings! They were lovers. They are man and wife. They were and are our friends. They begin life as we did years ago, homeless and houseless, but blessed with health, pluck, and a will to work. When the ceremony of marriage wag over, we shook each by the hand, and wished them well. But we did. not kiss the bride.- We would not wish every spectator to kiss our new bride.

Confound such custom! The bridegroom stands to see his wife in the arms or hands of others -then takes to his bosom his dream of purity, her lips pounded and flavored with various breaths, liquors, and brands of tobacco. Not any for us! The bride, a good, plain, honest, dark-eyed, sensible woman, asked, "Will you tell me how to always be as happy as now?" "Yes: always be so!" *    .  .  e  .  * , .  It is late to-night. We have been thinking how to help} our young .friends. The greatest help we ever had was from an earnest friend, who gave us good advice; and we thanked him for it.

That is like a toy passed to each generation I   Standing beford the linister.   139 We all wish the same. There is no particular secret about it. If you want a wife, you work to win her. If you want a husband, you act, dress, and talk to please him. This is well. As you do this, so does your love grow and fasten. If you want an education, study brings it. If you   want influence, you  work  for it. If you want happiness, plan   and work for it. Don't neglect twice to care for once.

You can be happy in a cabin as in a palace, if you will only try to make your heart right. The only real home we have on earth is in the heart, the arms, or the presence of those we love, and no one can occupy two rooms at the same time.

One man stopped at a little fruit-stand, threw down ten cents, and said good-naturedly to the old woman,- "Some pears, aunty. Some good ones for my little ones, and put 'em in the pail." They filled the pail nearly half-full. We looked at him in admiration, and thought of the joke he would have on the little ones when he gave them the pail to put in its accustomed place against the Monday. He looked good natured, and we asked him,- "How many little ones have youP" "Four." "Where do you live " "On Fourth Street." "Can you carry more than you have in your paill" "What do you mean?" "Can you carry, a few things up that way for- meV" ,    Burdens, and Those Who Bear Them. 147 "Well, I am not in the carrying business, but I don't mind to accommodate a man." "All right.

"Well, but-but-what for?

And we separated. He winked, and looked, and walled on to look back over his shoulder, as did we. He was not- insulted at our rude- ness, for the heart knows its friends.

And the cartmen, with tired horses, passed us to homes somewhere. And the streets were full of people on foot, crowding each other, as a little girl, not six years old -a ragged, barefoot, bare-head, half- dressed little thing, with a weazenish, shrunken, famine-pinched face,--came staggering across the street, with a heavy bundle of blocks and sticks, gathered from the ruins of a building near by, where the Jfie had been at workl yes- terday. It' was a- load we should not have cared to lug away, but she hurried on as if beingpmursued. As thought directed, we touched her shoul- der and lifted therefrom  the bundle, tied by a dirty cord. She sprang as if struck, and, with a tear in her eye, said,-- "(Please don't, sir; I didn't mean to steal them!"   Burdens, and Those Who Bear Them. 149 "Come here, little one." "No, sir; I'd rather go home!" "Coome here; don't be afraid. The bundle is too big for you; we'll carry it a little way for you." She looked at us, half in doubt, as if fear- ing a trick, or arrest, for they drive children away from   places where chips, little blocks, and sticks, are picked up in great cities. They are valuable - worth many dollars a cord - and luxuries are not for the poor! Think of this, ye who live in the country, by timber where the poor of New York would be happy if they could gather the limbs, and chunks, and bark, and sticks that are rotting. "What is your name?" "Anna McRafferty, sir." "Where do you live, Anna " "In Houston Street." "Is your father alive " "Yes, sir."  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7470-00000075"/> 150    Our Saturday Nights. "What does he do?" "Nothing, sir; but mother does." "What does your mother do, Anna]" "She does anything she can get to do, sir. She goes out to scrub, and  takes care of father." "Is your father sick?" "Sometimes he comes home nights sick, so sick he can't walk, and sometimes mother goes out to find him." And she told us this as we sat on the lit- tle bundle, by a fruit-stand on the Bowery. ' Did you ever see a little half-starved, six- year-old girl, whose dress revealed the en- tire anatomy and structure of her little skele- ton frame, eat pears . Did you ever see a half-starved cat or dog that had been kicked and pounded by cruel people, eat a piece of meat, gnawing into it, looking up and down, and all about, as if expecting some trick, some blow, some order to "get out"? If you who   Burdens, and Those Who Bear Them. 151 have plenty in the country, yet who are always growling, and whining, and finding fault, and worrying over your supposed poverty, could see the poor of our cities, you would de- serve cursing if you did not thank God for what you have and realize that you were and are kings compared to the starved ones, the human rats and mice that literally hunt for a living in this great city. From the Bowery into Houston Street went this "somebody's baby," bearing her great bun- dle.

God pity them all-old, young, friends or enemies. How many there are whose burdens we can see. But these are not the heaviest! Men struggling to live, to accumu- late--to save enough to make home comfort- able and own their own coffins! Men struggling to escape the burden of dissipation, yet lacking the pluck to walk out . from under therefrom like men. Women with cold homes, cheerless walls, bare floors, .starving children, and husbands going hellward through intoxication, leaving their home ones uncared for -their wives to beggary, their children to the street--their daughters to prostitution, the morgue, or death- house, and to the Potter's Field.

We close our eyes on the surface to open them  to -the interior of this picture of life, and see burdens in thousands of homes, -thousands of hearts,- and thank God that ours are no greater. And this is our strength-our life. No matter what our burdens, there are heavier ones borne by others! There is no person in the world but might be worse off.

To-night we are too worn and weary to write as we would like. We are like thou- sands who, all the week, have toiled beyond their strength to earn comforts for the dear ones, and who now  feel to envy those who sleep behind marble head-boards in the " silent city." Oh! for the good time coming, when we can be with the ones who wait our coming, and whose smiles are ever more life-giving than spring. The hours seem long as we watch the dial face, for the welcome that awaits us has in it that love which lures us to the happy eternal by mellowing the heart, purifying the soul, and giving us confidence in each other. .

But the day  comes when they will be more so, when they will go slowly to their homes with bent forms, as do thousands who will rest in their graves before there comes to any of us another Saturday Night. And the watcher by the hearth is weary! She, too, has toiled all the week. That clean floor, that well-kept hearth and fender, the snowy linen, the clean dishes, the sweet, clean shelves in pantry and cupboard, the clean doors, walls, and windows; that look of home cheer which should mark every earthly heaven; that tidy, sweet, lovable look, no matter for the years, tell that she too has labored and is weary. Then, good man, worling-nan and brother in toil, be kind, speak kindly, act kindly, lovingly, to the one who has worked for you as you have for 'her.   Rest for the Weary.     159 She'is the one who cares most for you, who in heart is the dearest; she is to you as you are to her-- two silken strands weaving to- gether to bless or to curse as you will. The world cares not for you. Not one of us is of account to the world, for it moves whether we do or not; it was here when we came; it will be here with all its cold, selfish in- difference when we die, and centuries after we are forgotten except in the deeds we do worth remembering. After a time will come the final Saturday Night to all of us, and the only ones who will weep and mourn, as we would for them, will be the ones who welcome us to the hearth and fender; who love us far more dearly than pen or words of ours can tell; who have often been weary, but always entitled to more rest and happiness than any of ,us here below.

Then the hours will fly, oh! so swiftly, as we are called to look with eyes of life upon those who are left behind to weep, and pray, and mourn.

We saw him    this afternoon, with his ragged cpthes, wrinkled face, bent form, and- thin, white hair, working on the sidewalk, sawing a little pine kindling-wood, and throwing it into the cellar, through a little round trap-hole. His battered hat was on a step hard by. His little old saw hardly felt the power that sent it slowly through the wood, for the arm was feeble, as was the life-current of the poor old man. We paused in our walk to look at him. Time was cutting away at him as he was at the wood, and soon he too will drop out of sight. God give him good rest when comes the day. "Good evening, uncle!"'

Mechanically he handed it to us, and we finished his task. while he sat and rested, evidently wondering if the "new man" at the job were crazy or a myth. And we thought, as we sawed the dozen sticks, that the work -of the old man was almost done, and wondered if God would doom us to live so long here, away from the beautiful^ "over there"! And we thought; and   thought that man was much like the saw: went up and down, cutting his way through life, at last to get  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7470-00000083"/> 166    Our Saturday 2tights. through just in time to see the sticks he has sawed taken for use by others! Then, what do we amount to more than the saw? This! there is a power, a 'Grand Arm, that directs us for a purpose; that causes us to cut blocks, to shorten old styles of doing work, to fit our work to the great temple being built silently in the East. Then we sat and- talked a few    moments with the old man. And he told us the simple story of a life--the first time he had ever told it. No romance, but plain truth. And this it was: Born.   Reared  by  wealthy parents near Rochester. Came   to New  York, years agop, when  a young man. Clerk in a hardware store on lower Pearl Street. Gay fellow with the boys. Married.  Spent his wife's fortune; buried  her, lived  in  dissipation; "luck" went against him   when. his old cronies saw him   going ruinward. Ten years he hadl'ived   Only a Poor Old Wood-sawyer!    167 in cellars and garrets, on floors, straw mat) rasses, coarse food, and sometimes none, and sometimes good meals, as those for whom he had done odd jobs at times called him into the kitchen. This was the story. Hardly more words than years to his life. But. he was almost through work. A little longer, and then good- bye, old saw and weary tramps for a little work. He   said the saw  was better than none. "When I file the saw   it works well. But men don't do so: sometimes they don't do  anything for what you do for them!" This is what the old man said, and it struck us as a great truth sawed'out of life by nearly eighty years of toil! Then we walked and talked. The heart of the old man had   gone. No home; not one to love  or care  for him. What mattered houses or lands to him; or horses or car- riages; or diamonds, or jewelry? No one was  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7470-00000084"/> 168    Our Saturday Nights.  glad when he came or sorry when he went. The joyous echoes of the past were drowned so deep in the dissipation of years agone, they came to him only in dreams! What an ending to lifel God's gift toward advancement frittered away! Thrown away, despised, trodden under feet, ignored, drowned in dissipation and -murdered, while "good fellows" clanked glasses and laughed at the fools who raved of 'life, of love, of honor, of manhood, of earnings, that when came the day to rest, there might be a place. Even birds save bits of down and lint, carrying them miles to soften their nests! And we came home, thinling of life and its duties, and of the poor old men all over the land. Of those. who had no regard for the future when they dulled their lives foolishy and tossed the days down their throats. And of the poor old' men, in shops, and on farms; and working by the roadside to catch. up in   Only a Poor Old Wood-sawyer    169 the race, and to help bury in paupers' graves those still poorer than themselves. And of the poor old men whose nights are full of tremors and ugly dreams, as they sleep on the briars and thorns of that life from which they cut out the beautiful to save the bad! What would you, honest reader, say to a man who should go into his flower-garden, and, with knife, shears, pincers, fingers, or hot poison, cut off, tear out, and' kill the beautiful buds, flowers, and seeds; leaving the roots, sharp-pointed limbs, and  odorless sticks as ornaments? Well, that man lives on each side of us. He lives everywhere. And when he dies, what a bouquet will his garden afford for the coffin! And there are girls-women, who thus ,do. God pity them, for they are insane! And there are others who go into their garden, cutting out the roots that give troubles and against which toes are caught, and branches,  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7470-00000085"/> 170  t  Our Saturday lights. that bear no flowers, and flowers that give no fragrant odor. Some will ride or walk by, and sneer at the honest' worker to-day; but they pause to admire to-morrow1 And they want to know how he made his garden so beautiful! And they will send there for flowers to deck the bridal vail or the funeral pall. The poor old man passed on to his garret on Eighty-first Street, and we to our writing. Such poor old men we pity. No one seems to care for them. They are taxed on their matches, on their rags, on their crust of bread, on their pipe and tobacco, on their medicine to benefit the rich. And it must be so lonely, this being near the wharf, with no one to go ashore with you that you know, or who cares for'you! Give us years that bend the chin to the chest if you will, but, O God in Heaven, give us some one to love even then, when the night is coming upon -us! The night that but hides /   Only a Poor Old Wood-sawyer!  171 the morn; but still, the night! It must be fearful to die alone and no one so Alone as the poor who are alone and -unloved. Kings and queens are those without dollars or dimes who may be old and poor, but yet loved and honorable. Hand in hand down the narrowing lane! There is glory in the old love, life in the old caresses, heart in the old kisses, and heaven in the flickering of that old life, which, with loved ones, wanders in beau- tiful gardens, from which those who wander and rest 'neath fragrant shades picked and clipped the thorns and brambles long ago. Let us all speak kindly to those who are old and growing old.  Very soon the nar- rowing road will shut them   out, and very soon we, too, will go out. And as we do by the poor and aged ones, so will others do kindly or unkindly by us, when our work is ended and comes, to rich and'poor, old and young, loved and unloved, the final Saturday Night.  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7470-00000086"/> XTX. HOME TO THE LOVED ONES. ^  LL the week at work. Day after day came and went like echoes from wona- rous shores. Morn, noon, and night, in each other's hand, closed upon the labors of us all, and made another volume of seven good, bad, or indifferent chapters. ' The work of the week is finished, and now, (172)   Home to the Loved Ones.    173 weary, heart sore, doubting life and not fear- ing death, we put by the pen and go home with those who, with us, have labored hard all the week past. Saturday Night is the jewel of His evening crown. It is the oasis on the desert of la- bor, for here we rest. A week is not much, yet it is morer than a life to many. Look about. See the honest laborers, the men of toil, the ones who are building up the country and working themselves into the , graves for the benefit of others, or to sustain life. We have seen them all the past week--all the past weeks of life. Men in shops, in stores, in offices; men through whose veins the hot life of blood courses as they build castles in the air for themselves and their loved ones to occupy; men who have long since passed the centre, and now verge upon the eternal. All the days we hate thought of the workingmen, of  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7470-00000087"/> 174     Our Saturday Nights. the ones who are, by labor, either of head or hand, supporting themselves and home ones. To-night they are going home. Tired, and needing rest, nervous, and needing kind words, they are going to their loved ones, and most earnestly do we say, joy, love, peace, and hap-- piness be theirs. For the workingmen deserve all this. And, good wife, when he comes home tired, be kind to him. Hours -after hours, days after days, he works to make a home. He works for you and the little ones. He thinks of you often-so often!  He saves where he might spend foolishy, and thinks of a thousand plans to benefit his loved ones and beautify his home. See the books, the papers, the pictures, the carpets, the little keepsakes he has from time to time brought with him. Each article cost him  toil. Iis hands may be hard, but his-. heart is warm. No man in all the world gives   Home to the Loved Ones.     175 so liberally to help the needy and relieve dis- tress as does the man who earns his bread in the sweat of his face, and by the muscle of his arms. It may be but little he gives, but that little is a part of himself-drops from the fountain which is filled but once, and which is lowered and lessened each week when comes Saturday Night. Hour after hour we sit and thinkl of the little homes of America. We look in upon thousands and thousands who see us not, and never think of our looking.   We love the homes of those who labor, for they seem dearer than the homes of the rich, who need no one to pity them. We look in upon those who live in little rooms up stairs--small rooms in cellars. Upon those who have homes, whole homes of their own; we see, in some, good wives waiting, with cheerful face, the coming of the tired one who is so loved. And we see, in some, clean, happy children, joyful, for papa  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7470-00000088"/> 176     Our Saturday Nigghts. is soon coming to kiss, to romp, to gladden. Then  we say, God  bless the workingmen who have homes, no matter whether they like us or not. And in some homes we see wives cross and peevish, dirty, slatternly, careless. They are not the girls once so loved, for time has wrought changes. And we see children, dirty and unrestrained, noisy and saucy, reflecting no credit on parents. And we see homes where the floors are bare, the walls unornamented by a single pic- ture, the cupboard empty, the coal-box empty or the wood pile low, the home ones clad in rags; for the one who should care for and protect them has spent his earnings in dissipa- tion, to make attractive those- places which ruin him. But we will not chide, for may be cold words, hot words, cutting words, and that unspoken and unspeakable sorrow of the heart -which no one can 'find words to tell   Home to the Lovecd Ones.    1" all of, has sent him often to any place rather than the cruel mockery of home. God pity all of us!  Do you ever think, working   brother, of home and the beauties you can crowd therein a Loved ones, who are so happy when you come with kind words to greet them. Rooms made beautiful by result of labor; books, pictures, papers, magazines, in which you can  read the thoughts of those who   toil, with the brain. And as you think of home all the week, are you not glad that there comes Sat- urday Night for us to give to those who have seen us so little all the week? We do not like cold homes, cheerless homes, where the heart is a tortured prisoner, but a bright, happy home, where the loved wait our com- ing. The home we can have, if we will it; the liome we can work for and be thanlkful for. The home where a warm, true, trusting heart, 12   &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7470-00000089"/> 178     Our Saturday lNights. dearer almost than the promise of Heaven, waits our coming. The home where she waits, with bursting heart, deep love-lit eye, and moist, loving lips, to welcome us as, hand in hand, heart to heart, there is- given such a welcome and unspoken vows for the future as no tongue or pen can tell. Home, where the heart is at rest, where one can sit for hours reading the volumes of love, unwritten, as they come from   the eye that telegraphs to eye words and secrets others know not of. Would to H]im who gives out the new days and calls in the old ones, torn, blackened, dis- graced and blotted by us on earth, that in all the land were none but happy homes, true loves and true hearts for all who toil, and bear burdens of heart or body.

We knew her years ago, when but a little girl; a romping, bright-eyed, pretty-faced little darling, the pet of all and the promise of surpassing loveliness. Year by year she grew, till the years came upon her like flakes of snow  (180)   About t/iat Little "Yes."   181 to protect her loving purity, and at last her heart warmed with a new love; and one Saturday Night the "Yes" she said, closed the past and opened the future to -God only knows what! It was one night when the week was resting from its whirl, and the good angel was weeping over our records, as the revolving days had stamped the good and the bad of our lives on the lasting pages before him, that a chosen one came to the door. How her heart throbbed, as it trembled, for, it knew not what. The hours had been longer than their wont all day, for he was coming. The sunset seemed so long a-coming; the twilight seemed so loitersome, even after the golden pattern for the morrow's clouds had been left in the west, that a'shade of anxiety rested over the face of the darling who waited. But he came. Who could not tell his step from  all others? And who touched  the door knob as he? No one! And by her side he sat. Hand in hand, palm on palm resting, eye  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7470-00000091"/> 182    Our Saturday NEights. reading eye, and hearts sweetly communing. The hours of man were the seconds of God, so quickly did they drop into the well of time. And as the new week came, with its flowery promises to cover the sorrows of the old between the dead " now " and the living " then; " as the seven-day volume was closed, not lips alone, but hands, eyes, heart, and soul said, "Yesl" One long, pure, trusting, lingering kiss; calling back all the kisses before given! and to the new week was born a new betrothal. This was then; one of the Saturday Nights of the past. And since then there was another kiss, as out oni the great sea went the new voyagers, brave, trusting, hopeful; loving. God be with them. And God be with her. She is good and pure. She has given him all of her past, present, and future, even to the foot of the beautiful throne. Her dreams in the past are on the shelves of the future; God grant they may blossom more beautiful- than the budding.   About that Little "Yes."    183 But these words from a friend who loves those who love. From one who is hastening on to the shore whichh bids good-bye to every Saturday Night, and crosses us to the golden Sabbath of a more busy rest. Busier, for we shall have more to do; more rest, for we shall know how better! These words from one who has had joys and sad- ness, oh, so deep and wearisome to heart and brain: The future of life is much as the past and the present. Not all the clou'ds we look upon are lined with that silver we can easily reach, though there is a lining for us if we but seek it aright. Not every flower on the distant plain to which we are walking is fragrant, nor the coloring as bright as in our dreams, for then we have glimpses of the beautiful Eternal Land to which the soul strays while we sleep. There  will come trials and sorrows, and troubles will ride on disappointments to find lodging in oar hearts. But they will go as they  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7470-00000092"/> 184    Our Saturday Nrights. come if we do not bid them to stay! There will be sad hours ; for these we all have; even Christ, our Redeemer, had. But only for a time! When comes the night, he will come, perhaps tired and weary, while you are rested. Be kind to him. Little do ye know of man's temptations. Thus it was from the first, and we shall be for- given as we forgive others. Do not expect too much. Wooing is the blossom; wearing is the fruit, which lasts only with care! And as ye are hopeful, so will ye be happy., The new life is opening before you. The great mission must be filled, for thus is the vineyard worked from the beginning. Oh the beauty of that faith which sets two hearts voyaging across the wondrous ocean. The journey may be long or short for one or both; but there is a meeting over there for those who loved on earth. The days go by like shadows in pursuit of dimmer ones. The reality comes to mock the ideal. The trials come to perfect our   About that Little "Yes?'   185 love and strengthen our faith in, and usefulness for the future. All over the land are those who last Saturday Night were maidens, who now are wives. God bless all such. And may the married ones ever be mated. And if not, then let the heart speak, for the bird will rest and fold its wings where its home is, no matter how far away. Let those who love, love more and be good to each other, -for thus life rests easy on us. Keep back the cross words, and drive doubts of him or her from your hearts. Strive to be good and kind. Often sit together as before wedlock, which, as a ribbon or a chain, joined you together, were it- before man or before Him who holds us all in keeping. Rest on the roses, not the thorns! Look over little evils, and great ones will not come so quickly! Bear with life's burdens bravely, and; they will be lighterl Strive and to make others so.

Let no Saturday Night come that the one you love is not in heart dearer to you; let no new Sunday volume of days be opened till the errors of the last be told and forgiven; then will you be happy. And you, brothers, who toil, let no Sat- urday Night come that you do not add some- thing to the comforts of home and the loved one; and the secret of happiness is before you. God bless all who toil; who struggle; who sincerely love each other. Each of us has another heart to make happy; and from the, lessons of the past let us all learn wisdom for the future. But all are not happy; all cannot be. Hearts will wander to their resting; but when that rest is found let the door be closed, that none else enter; that we may, with the ones we truly love, in health or sickness, poverty or wealth, now as then, go hand in hand, by day and by night, in sunshine and in storm, hopeful and happy, with trusting hearts to that land where never comes a Saturday Night.

This morning there came to our private room a sad-faced woman, a stranger to us. A thousand miles and more had she ridden to tell us her simple yet sorrowful story, and to ask the advice of one she believed would advise honestly. The tears ran down her cheeks, like rain down window- panes when the storm is terrible outside, as hers was in. She was a wife- a mother. She came to   She Brought a Skleton.     189 show us the skeleton in her soul; to tell us her sorrow. Her only daughter, a fair girl of several teens, had gone from her. The cruel treatment of a father had driven the poor girl out upon the world. From home she went to honest labor; from this to companionship with those whose hearts and self-control are not anchored; from this to an assumed name and into the whirlpool of fast life in this terrible city. Could we find her?  Would we find her? Dare we find her? Could we save her? Would we, and how? And the tears came out to give her heart room for its sobs, its sighs, its sorrows, and its sadness! Yes: we can find her, and we will; and some night like this we will tell you where, and what she said. And we have been- thinking all the day.

We see persons on the streets - in their homes. They toil, and rest, and laugh, and weep. There is a volcano in each heart, throwing out bitterness and sadness, yet the world knows not and cares not. Then why uncover a disfigured corpse for others to gaze on and satisfy morbid desires' Only to those who are friends! We have been thinking of the thousands of beautiful girls, who are lost to their homes and themselves, flying like down before the gale, or in the draft which draws them to certain heat, blackness, and destruction. The dress is not more varied than their adopted names. And how many of these are wept for by mothers who mourn as only mothers can mourn, and are cursed as- only men can curse?

There are many swamps, as God duplicates His creation. The one who wept before us this morning had been remiss in her duty. She paid the interest of her penalty in sobs and tears; death alone can pay the principal! Mothers- fathers, -think of your daughters. Love them more; care for them; protect them; guard them more closely. The dress you make to-day is worn for a-long journey!

There are wives and mothers, in thousands and tens of thousands of homes where this chap- ter will be read. God bless all who read it, and all who do not. And there are wives and moth- ers in the grasp of poverty, but not so poor as the one who came to us this morning, for her wealth had gone, perhaps never to be returned, at least with seal unbroken and stamp of purity uncan- celled! There are those in little cabins, log-houses rented rooms, garrets, cellars, farm houses, vil- lage homes, city residences; those who toil on plain or prairie, on hillside and in the valley; who are poor, but not so poor as the broken- hearted mother who came to us for help to-day. Perhaps you toil and mourn for the dead; but that is not dying for the living! There are   She Brought a Skeleton.    193 those of women who rise early, prepare the morning meal, rub, work, scrub, make, mend and labor, days and months; who may have rough, coarse, brutal husbands, who only marry to gratify passion and have a target to fire their anger at; wives who are neglected, uncared for, deceived, betrayed; who are compelled by that society which sanctions legalized and solemnized prostitution to take to their arms and bosoms those they once swore to love, warm from the passionate embrace of other loves; who envy the rich and mourn over their lot, yet who are rich compared to the mother who came to say she had lost her treasure. Have you a young husband who loves you, who is true to you? Then love him, no, matter how close the wolf stands to your door.

Then love him, and help him, and each add, by gentle touch, sweet caress, and ready care, to happiness. Have you a friend who is good, and kind, and devoted, and all in all to you as you are to him or her? Then continue so till comes the mating, and be happy, for the little cares which annoy, bother, worry, and trouble you; are nothing compared to the skeletons which burden the souls of thousands who would be happy if laden with no more care and sorrow than you are laden with. And have you work to do, a living to earn, a destiny to fill? Then do it as 'twas given you; bear up as well as you can; think how many are more miserable than you are, and if you have little ones,-have daughters to love and care,for,- teach them aright and thank God that the heart treasures you would take over the river  with you are not, by your neglect, carelessness, or negligence, lost overboard as food for the sharks which so thickly infest life's sea.

When I had health I preserved it, and when in need of money earned it. While others dissipated I rested, and gained strength for the cares, duties, and labors of the morrow. The days came, some bright and some cloudy; but they were no worse to me than others, nor were all the beauties for me alone. 'I did not expect too much; then I was not disap- pointed. The weeks came and went, but did not rob me of my manhood. I spent no hours in re- pinin..

Our years were fewer than now.   When   Soliloquy of a Harappy -Man.  205 we plighted troth, and when we knelt before the altar, I took her to my heart, as she took me to hers. And I have tried to be good. When I did not wish to fall or stumble, I kept away from temptation, and thus lost all desire to walk in dangerous places. Being a man, it was my duty to provide a home and strive to adorn it. Little by little, as I gained the. means, have I done so, till, from the desert of life,rhas sprung a loved place of rest, and here we live in, by, and for each other. Sometimes little clouds come up; but we look not upon them and they soon go. Sometimes I am sick, tired, weary. Then she loves me even more tenderly, holds my  aching head to her heart, presses the hair back from my brow, kisses me so sweetly! and  my troubles sink, into the fading fog of the past under her loving, caressing, and gentle touch. She whom I love is very, very good to me, and I could not be otherwise to her and be a man. x  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7470-00000103"/> 206     Our Saturday Nrights. We share our joys and sorrows. We strive to please each other, and pay little attention to the words of others, and thus secure happiness. And when she is tired and sick, then it makes my heart large to help her, to pet her, to love and care for her. Then her heart is at rest, her mind at ease; she says the look of my eyes is more , than medicine, and the gentle touch of love morel than all the world for her restoration. We are not ashamed to love eacli other. This we promised. We are not ashamed if others know it. God keep our hearts thus mated, and who shall say "nay"?. We live for each other. We live in the house we live in, and not in the one across the way! We are happy because we strive to( be. We love each other because we have so promised. We care for each other, for thus is that love whch grows and blesses us watered and invigorated. I want none of that which is forbidden, for it brings no good or hap- piness, and I'd rather keep unsullied the man-   Soliloquy of a Ha:ppy Blfan.   207 hood which wins and retains the love of the pure, loving, trusting heart I am so happy in keeping. And days I work for her--for us--for our home. And nights I rest. We sit by the same fire, quaff from the same cup, read by the same light, read each other's eyes; and when that irresistible impulse calls lip to lip, and hearts to heart, not for the wealth of kings or greatness of empires would I give up or forsake the bower where our love is undisturbed, no matter at whose coming. Yes, I am happy. We are happy. Our house is but small, but our hearts are large. She never speaks cross to me, nor I to her. At times when I write there comes behind me a soft footstep; I feel the presence of a loved one; I close my eyes to receive a gentle kiss on my forehead; an arn steals around my neck; as I turn my head eyes that tell so much meet mine; our lips meet; she sits on a low chair, with head resting on my lap; mny writing is only interrupted as I  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7470-00000104"/> 208     Our Saturday Nights. bend over at times to kiss the eyes and lips of her who is resting, and we are very, very happy. And sometimes, when I amin tired and weary, it is my head that rests in her lap. She works and talks to me, or reads while I toy with her hand, listen, half dreamingly, to her voice, and wonder how many years God will give us thus to love each other on earth before we are called home. Then we talk of the past, the present, and the fu- ture. And we, while thus resting, unreel the rib- bon of the past to find but few spots other than of beauty thereon. And when we find such a spot, we write "repentance" across it, that when God sees it He may know we have suffered and sorrowed and tried to atone for the making it. Then we feel happier. Then we rest sweeter in each other's hearts, and for fear I may die and leave her to battle on alone, I plan to-day and work to-morrow for 'her protection after I am gone, if it is for me to prepare a place for her in the eternal land.   Soliloguy -of a Happy jMan.   209 Perhaps you do not like this, my writing, but I do not care. We are happy. Even now her head rests under my left hand, and since the first word of this paragraph my lips have rested on hers. And we find our happiness in pleasing each other, and with this happiness comes strength to do what others fail in. And when comes the hour for labor on the morrow, we shall there be found. And such duties as the day may bring we will be ready for. And we'll try each to do our duty well. And when comes the morrow night, at home will we rest, for this is the secret of happiness. Others may dissipate and wander for the bit- ter-sweet; we are content to live as God in- tended. And we are not envious, for in time will come the luxuries of life, but they will not add to our happiness. Yes, I am   happy; for I try to be. I strive to live for some good. I use only kind words.

And this course brings and retains the respect of the good. It gives me the love and confi- dence of my friends; and those who are not, it is not worth while to strive to please. And as I am happy, so can others be if they will, even if they are, like me, simple laborers, taking care to avoid paths which lead to temptation, and not afraid or ashamed to ble men for the pres- ervation of that manhood which no poverty can wrest from us, if we respect ourselves, and which gives us strength to work the days of the week, and a relish for rest, with work well done, when comes the Saturday Night. v       -.

And He calls us to settlement, whether we are ready or no. Oh! that none but good records were against all of us! But no more of this to-night. It is' not of the past, and yet itt is. All the week we have toiled with brain and hand, till head and body be weary. But now we can rest, and lift from  the cooling spring, of memory beadlets strung with  pearl drops, wherein and whereon are beautiful pictures. We see a thousand faces thus.

The white dial of the watch before us seems to-night so much like a face we know: often have our eyes rested thereon. : We listen to the "think-quick-think-c  uick" of the heart-work of this little mechanism, and cannot half think. All gone! The loved  guests we had with us have gone. There were spirits of those who have crossed the river before us,-and the spirits of those who to-night are dreaming.

Sometimes to greet spirits over yonder! Sometimes- wandering with spirits from over there! And sometimes we wander among old scenes known before we became of earth, as in the future state we will roam the aisles of the past, which is our present. When we sleep, school is out, and spirits play! And sometimes we sleep while awake,-and start, we know not why! It is only the spirit- the soul, which has been playing truant, visiting miles away-returned to its penacwe! When the old house is worn out we move into another one!

At times we feel sad and lonely.   Very Lonely.       215 Waves run not smooth like placid water, nor does life. It may " over yonder," and this is our hope, our full faith. But  to-night we  miss somebody.  Our thoughts are with some one else. The room seems very still. Never so still before. We long to be there,--to be away from here; to look into certain eyes adown whose depths are traced characters -others cannot, but which we can read. We would feel the soft, sweet breath of some one; we wait the pen for a hand. to touch ours, for loved fingers to rest as before on our almost bursting   temples; but alas! the eyes are not before us only as they glide with the pen point across the paper on which we write! And the     dear fingers will not still the throbs which pain us.. The sweet lips we have so often pressed the very soul upon and into will not come to us to-night, nor can we feel the throbbing of that heart wherein we know our image-  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7470-00000108"/> 216-    O0ur Saturday Nights. is enshrined as an emerald is surrounded by diamonds pure and of wonderous lustre. Did  you ever wish somebody with  you when miles were holding hands, not hearts, apart? Did you who read these lines ever feel so hungry because some one more than loved was not with you? Did you ever pace the floor, press against the pane, listen to footsteps, grow heartsick over an absent one, till it seemed as if you must go somewhere, anywhere?  Did -you ever grow    faint and weary of life in knowing that somebody, no matter who, were away, and you just dying for their presenceS When the work of the day is ended, then we want rest. Not alone the easy chair, the yielding sofa;- not one of your hard, stiff, quakerish contrivances, but a comfort; not alone the carpeted floor and pictured walls,- that which- gives rest to'eye and body,--but we want rest for the heart.

But to-night we are alone; yet not alone. The words she said,* the kisses she gave us, the caresses none can rob us of; the plans, and hopes, and promises, and darings of and confidence in the future,--all these are with us.

And some day! Thank God for that! Then we who work can rest. If we save we shall enjoy! If we are good we shall be happy; that is, happier thank if we are not. And we can work for others, can speak kind words for those who toil, and suffer, and sorrow, and hope, and wait, and with brave, patient, trusting hearts, sit on the shore of the inrolling sea, waiting for the golden ship and the calm which settles on the waves to still them.

T  ATURDAY    NIGHT   of last week four neighbor lived beside us, in a little home all his own.  We have chatted with him by the hour. Vhere he came from we do not know. He was a good fellow; we liked him, and never thought to ask where he came from. When came Saturday (219)  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7470-00000110"/> 220    Our Saturday jNight&amp;. Nighty he would come to our little study and c- talk with us, sometimes half an hour. Then he would go home to his dear ones of the heart, and love them, and kiss them, and pet them, and romp with them. His wife al- ways seemed so happy; her eyes, dark and beautiful, ran over with love, and when his name was mentioned, would sparkle as her heart danced to the joyful tune, "My darling is he, ,and all mine own." Sometimes we could hear them reading to each other. Once we saw him reading by her side as she sat rocking to sleep a dear little one in her arms. He read from a book, and as he read one hand rested carelessly, but speaking volumes, on one of hers, inspiring him with the good. Then we saw through the broken blind, as we stood against the fence watching, that she stopped her rocking, looked tenderly upon the face of her sleeping babe,- and then upon the loved and manly form beside her. Their eyes   About Our .Neighbors.    221 met. He closed the book, and drew his chair still nearer--rested his head on her bosom beside the face of the little sleeper, with his face upturned. She looked upon her treasures a moment; a tear fell from her eyes; their lips met and drank from the luscious joy and happy fulness of the heart. They were happy; and we mused in our room an hour, disturbed at last by the walk of a drunken man going to his home. Ours was a good neighbor. He   minded his own business. He spoke but kind words. He worked in a blacksmith-shop. His hands were very hard, and his muscles! How we envied him this overplus of strength. What he had he earned, and   what he  earned he saved to beautify his home. He was not stingy nor miserly. He gave dimes to poor children, and was for his little ones a God-given play- thing, dearer to them than all the toys in the world. He left his care in the shop; took his  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7470-00000111"/> 2. 232     Ozu Saturday eights. heart home, hung his dignity with his coat on a hook, and lived for the ones he loved. And that is the way to live. Why bother to please those who care not for you? This Saturday our neighbor moved away. -we knew he was intending to go soon. He told us months ago that a man was building a new house and a better one for him over the river, on a neat, clean, wide street! He said he was going there to live, and to earn better wages in another shop. - And he said his loved ones would be nearer. We told him, years ago, if he wanted a better place to work in, and a better house to live in, and better times gen- erally, it lay in his power to obtain them. And he worked, and saved, and kept his manhood pure and unweakened by excess or dissipation. He wanted to have a better home, and he saved his earnings till at last he could have a better one,   About Our Veighbors.    223 We don't know as yet where it is, but are to go over the river in a few days and will find him. We have the directions. We know who he went to work for. A very liberal employer, who em- ploys none but the best and most deserving work- men! And His work is always perfect. We know where to find our neighbor when we go over there, and shall be glad to meet him. A wagon came and took him away. And it took all he had ever earned. The good man sent the wagon, but we did not know who drove it. It is a little lonesome now, for our neighbor has moved. - We look at the little worn-out house he left, and look ahead with joy to the time when we shall leave our little house for a better one over where he has gone. We know where he has gone, for all these years he has been wishing to be there -to better himself when he moved; and as he has laid up something and proved himself a good workman, he would not go into a poorer  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7470-00000112"/> 224     Out Saturday Nights. house, or work for a poorer employer than hahad on this side the river. This house where our neighbor lived is empty. It is to be torn down in a- few weeks, and the material all carried away. But our neighbor has gone to a better house, for he was a good and a deserving man. Our neighbor has gone  We did not see him go. But to-day we saw a span of horses drawing his house away! His house was in a long affair used for moving such houses. It was moved away for the reason that our neighbor had got through with it-gone to his beautiful home over the river, where the smiles of God tint the flowers of the eternal, and where all is love, kindness, and that perfection unknown here. We shall not weep over the house our neighbor -our good friend--moved from, for that will do no good. To be sure, it is lonesome without   About Our Neighbors.    225 him, but we know where to find him. The other day a man moved away, but we know not where he went to. He had no steady employment when he lived by us. He worked for almost any one, but he was not a good workman, and could find no employment over there/ He worked mostly for himself, and people took but little interest in him. He had some friends, but they lived all about in bad places, and we think he ' has gone to find them. We are sorry we did not go over the river, but cannot help it. And before long we shall go to meet our friend. And he will introduce us to the other workmen, and indorse us; and we shall all be friends at once, and be with those who are there paid hourly and not compelled to wait till the coming of Saturday Night. i , . *  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7470-00000113"/> XXVI.

A few years since we began without a dollar. One night our palms rested in each other, our lips met as never before, we promised earnestly and faithfully; have kept vows deeply graven on our hearts. Then we started out on the voyage of united love. The -great sea sang murmuring at our feet. Its distance 'was flecked with tiny sails. There were icebergs and green isles in the dis- tance, but none near the velvet shores! Is it thus to tempt people?  So or not so, those who look beyond the reach of momentary vision can see open sailing,--that icebergs can be missed and the green isles far out yonder be reached. But not except those who sail the craft be of one mind! Let both steer for the same port and channel: it will be reached. But, alas!' too many sail on, wrapped only in the present squandering of the future, and soon put back for  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7470-00000114"/> 228     Our Saturday Tights. another craft or float on the surf that throws and dashes and spatters itself in mockery over the rock-ribbed shore, not harder .than the com- posite of error on which many a frail bark is stranded. There is much in mating.    There is much more in not overloading the  craft. There is much in not taking too many passengers with you; and there is much in working the ship together, and very much in not giving to others the delicacies which never outlast the voyage except used only by those who put them up for their own use! But no more of the sea: we must not float So far from the Shore- So far from our Home- So far from our Love-  So far from our Duty-- * So far from our Happiness- So far from Ourselves  .  .  .  .     *  .  .  .   Plain Words about our .ome.  229 How did we win this home? Little by little. Thanking God for yesterday, for to-day, for to-morrow; for hope and for pluck.- It did seem hard to begin from nothing years ago, but we thus begun. We decided to fit our craft for a long voyage, in hope to visit very many of the distant isles. So we saved. What was earned by the plow, the spade, the scythe, the axe, the pick, the labor of hands, was saved; not to be hoarded, but to be spent. The money earned in the shop by the forge fire did not float off in steam like the water put on burning coal; it did not thin off into shav- ings fit only to kindle desires; it did not drop into the pile of cloth scraps, leather bits, and waxed ends; we did not leave it fastened to the cup of dissipation, nor invest it in weeds to grow up and choke our manhood. It was saved for the good it might do; was paid to those who built our home, and those who in a tliousand other places were working to make  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7470-00000115"/> 230    Our Saturday Nights. this and that of the useful and beautiful, to be purchased, paid for, and enjoyed by all who would or will make home attractive. Is it not wonderful how working-men help\ each other? And how little we do for those who made all these beautiful things for us!- these carpets, chains, tables, pictures, glass, and frames; the house we live in, the stove we cook upon, the bed we sleep on, the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the dishes we use, the medicines we take, the piano we listen to, the jewelry our o loved wears, the books and papers we read; the pen we use, the ink we are wasting, the watch which tells us of the hour, the curtains which exclude the glance of eyes outside as we sit writing, stopping only to pet, and kiss, and love the dearest one on earth,-who says she cannot help loving us! Why! If all the men and women, boys and girls, who had worked on the articles in our home should call to-night; who would-who   Plain Words about our Some.    281 could care for our guests? They would be here by the thousand! Verily, the idea, the truth of our own littleness, as we have to think of how little account we are to others, and how many others work for us, is enough to drown the soul into its own shrinkage!- But it is not of this--but our home. When night comes, here we rest to gather strength and grow heart-mellow in love. Here we have a castle a king might envy, all won by honest toil. The rooms are alwa ys so neat and in order. The bedclothes clean, the sweeter to rest for the better health for the morrow. We have not so much as one cross word in all the year. We care not what others say of us, for the sun of happiness draws its warmth, not from what others say or do, but what we do or think of ourselves. When our friends come they are very wel- come. Little or much that we have, they are indeed welcome. We never fix up for anybody;  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7470-00000116"/> 232     Ouz Saturday Nights. but keep fixed up, as good wives-say, for ourselves. Then we are never surprised. If people come to see us they are welcome. - If they come to feast on fat things, they can have no better than we have, without going to a hotel, --and then they may not. If we have a crust, and that only, half is theirs. We 'have no parlor for them alone, for it is all parlor in our home; all as nice as we can have it; we keep no room locked, darkened, musty, and unopened only at stated seasons, to show how foolish we are not to enjoy the good and comfort of life as we live, while waiting, as it were, for the hearse. The best we have earned is none too good for our love, who is the best of all, and for her are all these purchased. We do not like to see peo- ple sit in the hot sun when a shade is close by, nor live in bare rooms in order to show people they do not know how to enjoy parlors. Empty parlors are but musty tortures: vain displays of C;   Plain Words about our Home.    233 taste used in too many instances only for wed- dings and funerals. Rightly kept, they are homes; securely locked up, -they are prisons or sepulchres of ignored joys, comforts, and happi- ness. Our home is our parlor. Our parlor is our home. We labor day after day. And as our will to dare, and power to accomplish, like the darkness, fades out before the coming of the great light, we strive for the goldening of our love, for the beautifying of our home for the great preparation. Those who care not for their homes here,-how can they care for them in the hereafter The present is- but the fitting of the future. As we strive here we are rewarded there. You need not tell us that we enter our new homes as we came here,- empty-handed or empty-hearted. What did Christ say about the talent which was hidden in a napkin?

All we earn, save, or gather here of the good, the pure, and the noble, is credited to is over there! If we care not for ourselves in honor, for others in love; if we toil not to-day for the rest "to-morrow," why should He or others this side of Him care for us? We wish and pray that more' of- our work- ing-men may have better homes;- that they may more earnestly care for their earnings, their lives, their manhood. Those who do not are not the happy ones. Nor are their families. Not care to hoard, but to beautify, to adorn, to clothe, to educate. The noblest men in the land are the sons of working-men, mechanics, laborers, farmers, who have oft been sneered at ofl account of their poverty.   The happiest homes are those built on the enduring founda- tion of honest toil. We would see every home happy. Would throw open the musty parlors, swing the blinds, clear out the dust and cob- webs; fill closets with clothes, libraries with   Plain Words about our Home.   235 books, cupboards with food, the home with laughter and cheerfulness, and the heart with joy. We would see the wife and little ones happier,j the husband more contented and en- couraged, parents more proud of and kind to their children, children set good examples and taught good manners, with neatness and gentle- ness. And we would see men of hearts and desires to do good, stand closer by each other and by the unfortunate, to protect and love. We would ignore and abolish the laws which now rob the working-man of hard-earned money for the benefit of those who pay no taxes on ill-gotten incomes; would wipe out as with red- hot fire the prohibition which comes to us through Puritanism, and laythe foundation for high deeds, noble resolves, great undertakings, and that success which marks our progression tc worthiness of future greatness by the firesides and in the homes of the working-men of the  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7470-00000118"/> 236    Our Saturday Nights. land, who are our real and only princes for the present, and joint heirs for the future. Who of our friends-of our readers -of the public we strive, but can do so little for- will have the pluck to begin a new life and devote more time and more of his earnings to making his home more attractive than per- chance it may be this Saturday Night.

To say, "Here, stranger! settle with the good woman/, was but natural; but he blustered on, only turning his head to mutter, - "Hang your old woman; let her keep out of the way!" Now, this was all very independent, for it showed that he who hastened on was a man! But we felt like hating him from that moment. A great, large man, and so unfeeling! We pity his mother. We pity him, aye, more than we did the old woman 'whose fruit we helped the little girl pick up, and whose broken fruit-stand we helped fix. He needs pity, as any man does who has a brutal heart. And we pity his mother, who would never have thought this of her boy. Only an old woman! We do not like any person who does not show love and respect for the aged ones, who at best can be with us but a little while. God knows, the sorrows that come naturally about the sun-   lTe Old Woman.       239 down of life as swallows homeward fly, are more than we know of, and he is unworthy the name of man who is not kind to the aged.

Who was this old woman? We know not. And from her. sad face we judge none others know! But Once?    Yes, once she was a baby,--sweet, smiling, winsome. Then she was petted. and admired. The years came in turns and laid their wreaths at her feet, and on them she stepped to womanhood. Then her eyes were bright, her step elastic, and her young heart was filled with the gentle whispers of that love which so often leads to but seldom occupies the charming castles of its wondrous  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7470-00000120"/> 240     Our Saturday lig-hts. creating. Then she was not old nor ugly. Smiles like bits of golden sunshine pictured her face as lovers gazed- thereon. Her hand was not skinny as now when it rested in his years ago, nor was her eye filled with ashes of ,life and love as now. Then she was not an old woman, but was fair and sweet, perchance like the one the brusque, brutal man was going to visit to-night; the one he too will abuse if the years rest shadows on her face and form till she becomes an old woman. The man who is not good to the old, will be cruel and spiteful to any one he may profess to love when the fantasies of desire have feasted their fill; and there comes even a momentary despon- dency to the best of hearts. They were years of the past when she was young. Then some " old woman" was caring for the man who has no little heart for the aged. And she who is now old had her loves, her hopes, her dreamings of the future. The love-   The Old Woman7.      241 light came to and went from her eye, as words from the heart of another called beautiful visions to her future beholding. The cares of life came to- her. One by one troubles settled round her path like beasts of prey waiting to spring on innocent victims. The hopes of early years went one by one out, filled or unfilled, but never more to return, for the links of life have no second coming. Companions of younger days went to their new homes here or in the hereafter, leaving the woman who is now old. The hours of sickness, the grave; thus, one by one, went her sunshines to shades, and for each loss or hope unfilled came a wrinkle, as time kept most faithful account! God pity her now, for her charms sleep under the sod of the terrible past, never more to come to gracefher face or form till the renewal of all this in the beautiful home over the river, The young live in the future; none of us, or 16  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7470-00000121"/> 242     Our Saturday Nigits. very few, live in the present; the old live in the past, and their sunset ho ars are more upon fading than growing pictures. And while the young array and look at the ribbons for the morrow, the old must content be with resting eyes on the weeds of the past, and their hearts on deeds of goodness or charity. How few of us think of the old people! Cares of business or hopes for pleasure drive them from our hearts. Perhaps it was so with them once, yet we hope it will not be so with us. It is up hill to the summit, or down to the grave, and the path down the mountain is slower than the one going up! We pity the aged. Looking on their faded beauty, their weakening steps, their decrepit, forms, we often wonder what we shall do when thus we come to their milestones, if, so be it, ours be the travel so far before comes the nearing shore. If the years come, the joys of now must go! It will not be always that we can be strong and earnest, filled with hot blood, deep desires,    The Old Woman.      943 and an appetite for the varied dishes of life, from which we, who are in the full flush of health and vigor of maturing years, enjoy. The touch of love which now sends that wild delirious thrill from soul to soul will in time be less than now. The flowqrs will become tangled vines laden with memories, but devoid of that beauty now so charming. The prizes for which we all grasp will come and go, and we will be kindly dealt by in God's own  good way as we have been kind to the poor and the aged ones here with us, but not long to stay. Do not pass them roughly by. What was once all theirs, is now all ours; or it will be soon. And what is ours will some day belong to others! Life, nor riches, nor greatness rests with us alone forever. We drink and pass the cup! The train darts by: others saw it before; they will after we have gazed thereon. It costs but little to be kind to the aged. And kind words fall on old hearts like dew on fading 9T  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7470-00000122"/> a4    OOr Saturday 1Nights. flowers, bringing anew the fragrance of the past.

When there was beauty in the sky, 'twas she who pointed it out to us. When others said we would fail, 'twas she who said we, could not and would not, for love would sustain us.

Lats Saturday Night we saw him on the street, slowly walking to a cheap home.

He never begged. A sad, strange look was always upon him. Yet he was not cross nor ugly. 'e was cheerful, and would sit for hours talking to little children, and watching them at play. At times a few tears would fall from his eyes, to be wiped from his furrowed cheek on the back of his wrinkled hand. He lived in a little house back on the prairie; a half-hovel affair; and no one lived with him. Sundays the children would visit him, and bring water from a distant well, and wood by the armful. lHe gave them  nothing but kind words, but they brought him bread, and meat, and fruit, and papers from our sanctum;'and when he was too lame to go out, the boys and girls would wait on him. Sometimes he would sit by the hour tell-   The Poor Old .Man.      257 ing stories to his little friends. He told the boys how to make arrows, and kites, and cross-gtins. And he told them how to cure their sore toes and sore fingers, and when to fish; and that it was wrong to be ugly and cross. Tuesday evening one of the boys came and wanted us to go to -Uncle Benny's cabin, for he was sick. We found him on his cot, very low and feeble. A cruel fever was warring upon that old body. Then 'we went for a physician, and with the ola man staid till morning, when others came. His little friends brought oranges and lemons, jellies and wines from their homes. And a clean sheet was put under him, another over him; cooling drinks were given him,.anx- , ious faces were all about him; but Friday morning, just as the sun rose above the bluff east of the city, his head slowly fell back, his mouth opened, there was a rattle in his throat, and as the sunshine struck the little cabin his 17  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7470-00000129"/> 258    Our Saturday  igIhts. soul went out, riding on the golden beams of a -new life. Gently we gave him to the winding-sheet, and more carefully combed than usual was the straggling hair which wanted to creep down over his forehead, to see if the eyes were never more to open! And a few kind women made him a shroud, slighting never a part thereof. And a few men bought a neat coffin, paid the sexton, and this afternoon, men and women, and boys and girls, slowly walked behind him to his rest. We have attended burials, but never saw more tear-filled eyes than when the little ones looked for the last time upon poor Uncle Benny, as the coffin-lid was opened just before he was lowered to the great rest. No one knew him other than as Uncle Benny, though for years he had come and gone with his crutch.  His, face was noble yet sad in its death look, but it was not of suffering.       . And we went with others back to the silent L   TA/e Poor Old .Man.     259 cabin. How-morp than lonely it seemed! Two chairs taken from a neighbor's house onr'which to rest the coffin. /A quaint old .arm-chair, with a piece of. worn sheepskin for cushion; a little old stove, a few tin dishes; an old box serving purpose of table and chest; a few old garments in pieces, some liniment in a bottle, and a few little articles worth nothing. "What shall we do with them?" ' Oh, you take them; look them over and do as you please, said they." In one corner of the chest was an old Bible, badly torn. And a little box, very, very old, as if made by a boy years ago. It would hold a quart, perhaps. It was tied seven times ground with a peice of stout cord lilke a chalk-line. In it were a pair of dingy silk gloves, once white, but now faded into a sickly yellow. They were much too small for his hands. And a very old needle or pin cushion of black cloth, the size of an apple. And a letter, old, dingy, greased, and  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7470-00000130"/> 260     Our Saturday lights. creased, folded in a piece of soft leather. And a plain gold ring, not much broader than the line of life in our palm. The letter was too old to read. Its age no one could tell. But in it, on a peice of thick paper, in ink, long since bleached into faintest lines we read,- "Married -In Albany, May 6, 1813, Benjamin Waldower to Elizabeth Van Dorn." And this was all. But it told its own story. Then we turned the paper over, to read written on the back of it, the lines, almost indistinct,-- "Died - In NTewhurg, February 17,1814, Eliza- beth Waldower and infant son." The story of a life! Poor old man! And this was his treasure; that was the ring. Oh, how long- the years must have seemed while he was waiting to go to his loved ones! And have they grown old there as he did here? Will he find them as they went, or have they felt years added where there are no years? *      *    \       .  - I    The-Poor Old Man.     261 But will it not be grand when we can, at appointed time, solve the wondrous mystery, and. know that of which we now know nothing?

Over the household came a shadow. The child's voice rang out no more in merriment; we all felt sort of sad, dark, trembly, like as if we wanted, to say something, but could not. And the. next day our little friend was sick. The doctor came. She had over-played, taken cold, and suffered. The next day she grew worse.

The merry laugh, the childish voice, the romping over the floor, the climbing into our lap, the efforts to tease, and the scamperings here and there were all gone.  Great tears had spread themselves over the mother's eyes, the voice of the father was low and hushed, for the dearest darling of' all was away. God knows we pitied them.    We pitied him, for he would have given his own life to have recalled the sharp words.' But she had  gone   The Old Bureau Drawers.     26t home with them, a scar upon her heart, tender and painful. We sat and talked, and, manly or not, our tears came with theirs, to d'rop into the cloud of sorrow before us. And while he sat, with hands on table, and head resting thereon, try- ing to reach to her for the words he had given, and the life he had lost, we went with her into another room. She carried a lamp. It was a poor man's house, and not fitted with gas and conveniences, as are the houses of the rich. Steadily the door was opened.   The two windows were darkened by curtains. In a corner of the room stood ani old bureau. She pulled out a drawer, next but one to the top, and there were piled and packed all the little clothes of the one we mourned. The little dresses were there.   The little shoes and stockings were in one-corner, while in another were the little toys, once the delight of our little pet. There were little ribbons,  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7470-00000134"/> 268     Our Saturday Xights. such teeny   little  ones. And little cups and saucers, as she had played with them. But s8he was not there. The little Clothes she wore a week since were all there, folded nicely, as were the beautiful little hands we saw in- the coffin, folded over her breast, as if she was saying, - "Now I lay me down to sleep." And the little apron she had torn by catch- ing it as she ran past a wood box, and for which came the cutting words. This too lay there, folded with the rest, just as she had worn it and torn it. In a little box were one, two, three, four little curls, golden anrd beauti- ful, and one of them  for us. You, who are rich do not  always know  which  are  the rarest treasures! The tears of the mother dropped fast into the second grave of her lost one. Never a word- -did  either speak; her heart was, oh! so far   The Old Bureau Drawers.     269 away.   And as the draier was closed, and silently we returned to another room  with our treasure, we could not help thnking of others who mourn for little ones, of the thou- sands of drawers or little boxes all over the land wherein are kept most sacredly the tear- wet mementoes of the loved ones who have gone before. Dearer than life are these treas- ures. Here  mothers can weep  and pray; here the heart can overflow its bitterness, and take another look, and leap toward the beau- tifil future, where are- waiting those we loved, but, who have gone. And as you would meet there the dear ones of the heart, speak kindly. Another Saturday' Night, and you ,may be childless.. Another Saturday Night, and  your tears may drop in upon the little folded clothes and playthings. And it must be hard to know that our lost ones carried with them- hearts covered with the bruises our lips or acts hvre made.

And not for the result of a life of toil would we have our little darling die; per- haps- her last thought be- obf words to her spoken which cut and wounded.   You see we cannot call back the words, nor our lost ones, to ask them to forgive us. All the evening we have sat and thought of the bureau drawers which hold more than the clothes of the little darling who died,- they hold the hearts of the living.  They are rounds in the ladder which reaches 'way up there beyond the blue and --into the golden; beyond the clouds into the smiles. In palaces and fine mansions, where hired nurses care for little ones, these drawers are not so richly freighted; hot in the homes of the poor, yes,   aThe Old O Bureau Drawers.   271 and in some of the homes of the rich, they hold more than tongue can tell. Then let us love our little ones more. Let us always speak kindly to them. Then they -will love us and try to do right. And if we go home- to rest in the beautiful land before they go, they will love our memories and so live as to meet us.' As yet we have no bureau drawer over which to weep.

But we often think of those who have, and wonder if those who mourn were kind to the little ones whose mounds are in the churchyards, but whose play- things are folded and put away, as is our work for this Saturday Night.    ,  &#xD;<pb n="272-273 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7470-00000136"/> SATURDAY NIGHT IMPROMPTU TO MY DARLING, INTNG I before to-night I close my eyes In sleep, an earnest kiss to thee I send By the loved spirits. A sweet surprise And welcome as the glances from thine eyes When on thy lips mine did oft attend- A pure, lingering liss of love, Darling, good-night  Saturday Night! would that I were by thy side, Palm on palm resting as in hours of yore; wVhen to my kisses you with like replied, And our hearts in love grew strong allied, Waiting love's rest on the eternal shore. Interest on those kisses now I send,   , d Darling, good-night I Heart loved, I pray "Our Father" each night to bless The one to whom I send this kiss of love; And then I linger .on the last caress You gave me, and, Darling, I must confess I think more of it than of Him Above! Then take this kiss for thee alone Darling, good-night! THE END.
