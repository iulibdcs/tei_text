               <p>There is now 15 niggers, men, wimin and childern, or ruther, mail, femail and yung, in Wingert's Corners, and yisterday another arrove. I am bekomin alarmed, fer ef they inkreese at this rate, in suthin over sixty yeres they'll hev a majority in the town, and may, ef they git mene enuff, tyrannize over us, even ez we air tyrannizin over them. The danger is imminent! Alreddy our poor white inhabitans is out uv employment to make room for that nigger-even now our shops and factories is full uv that nigger, to the grate detriment uv a white inhabitant who hez a family 2 support, and our Poor Hows and Jail is full uv him.</p>

               <p>WAREAS, Wen yoo giv a man a hoss, yoo air obleegd to also make him a present uv a silver platid harnis and a $350 buggy, so ef we let the nigger live here we air in dooty bound to let him vote, and to marry him off-hand, and</p>

               <head>HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH VALLANDIGHAM.</head> 
               <opener>
                  <dateline>WASHINTON, Joon the 1st, '62.</dateline>
               </opener> 
               <p>I am in Washinton. I stand under the shadder uv the tempel uv Liberty, and am reposin my weery lims in the kool shades uv Fredum. But I can't reelize that this is the saim Washinton I yoost 2 visit. I yoost to go frum Pennsilvany to the kappytle wunst a yere to git my stock uv Dimocrisy recrootid, and to find out wat we wuz expectid to bleeve doorin the kumin yere, thus gettin full 6 munths ahed uv my nabers. I wuz wunst electid gustis uv the peese in Berks county, by knoin neerly a yeer in advanse wat we wuz to vote fer that ortum. They thot Nasby wuz a smart man.</p> 
               <p>2 resoom. This is not the Washinton that wunst I knode. Our kappytle is now a Ablishn kamp. The brite sun reflex glittrin raze frum shinin baynets-the ere is horrifide with the rumble uv kannon wheels, and the iren-shod war-steed klatterz on the stony street. The slaiv-pens, them proud moniments uv the sooperiority of the Anglo-Sacksun race, hez bin swep away, and with them the heft uv the Democrisy. O! my kountry! Wher is Tooms, and Yancy, and Wigfall? The lofty domes uv the kappytle don't re-ekko no moar 2 thor sole-inspirin voisis. Ez I reflek that these pillers uv Dimocrisy aint hear, and wat is wuss that they dassent kum here-that these place that knode em wunst will kno em no moar furever, my manly buzzum throbs with sorrer, and my prowd form is bowed in anguish. O thou fell sperit uv Abolishnizm, thow hast much 2 anser fer-mucher than thow kanst anser. Wood that I cood heve thee owt uv these sakrid precinks, and with gentil stranes woo back them ez we hev lost. Avant thow grim and nasty cuss-my stumick heeves wheneer I think uv thee.</p> 
               <p>2 resoom. I kum hear to see Vallandygum-I huntid him up, and last nite we mingled our goys and sorrers in a talk that lasted 2 ours. We bed a bottle uv koncentratid kontentment, and after disposin uv a suffishensy thereof, Vallandygum commenst:</p> 
               <p>"Nasby," sez he, "we're in a fix."</p> 
               <p>"Vallandygum," sez I, "to wich do yoo elude-our distractid kountry?"</p> 
               <p>"Nary," sez he, "I wuz a speekin uv myself, and the rest uv us. Them's my kountry."</p> 
               <p>"Sagashus man," sez I, "youm rite. Politerkilly we're ez bad off ez our frends in Fort Warin is personally-we're in a tite place."</p> 
               <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7106-00000004"/> 
               <p>"Yes," sez he, "and we must git out. We must carry Ohio this ortum."</p> 
               <p>"Certingly," sez I, "but how?"</p> 
               <p>"I hev," sez he, "the plan uv the campane fixt. Fustly, we must oppose the holesail votin by niggers."</p> 
               <p>"But," sez I, "no niggers votes in Ohio."</p> 
               <p>"Nasby," sez he, a puttin his thum to his nose, "a man uv straw <unclear>is</unclear> the eeziest knockt down, especially ef yoo hev set him up yerself fer the purpus uv knockin uv him down. Secondly, the immense emygrashen uv niggers into Ohio must be prohibytid.</p> 
               <p>"But," sez I, "no niggers air comin, er hev any noshun uv comin in2 Ohio."</p> 
               <p>"3rdly," sez he, "the alarmin amalgamashun uv the races must be prohibbytid."</p> 
               <p>"But," sez I, "ther 's no amalgamashen north uv the Ohio river."</p> 
               <p>"4thly," sez he, "the idee uv allowin the nigger to stand on a equality with the whites, must be squelcht."</p> 
               <p>"But," sez I, "noboddy wants 'em to be our ekals."</p> 
               <p>"5thly," sez he, "no nigger must ever be allowd to hev offis in Ohio."</p> 
               <p>"But," sez I, "nobody wants the nigger to hev offis."</p> 
               <p>"Never mind, Nasby," sez he, "nigger is our trump card-we must lead off with it. Taxes is a good dodge, fer no man likes to pay taxes, and we must work em up on that. After nigger, compromise is our best holt. Ef by a fair, ekitable compromise-"</p> 
               <p>"To-wit, givin our Suthern brethren all they want," murmered I-</p> 
               <p>"We kin end this unnateral war," continnered he, "wich hez tored up the foundashens uv liberty, and rent the proud old Dimekratik party in twain,"-</p> 
               <p>"Into 2 twains," sighd I, like a ekoin zephyr.</p> 
               <p>"And reskoo the guverment from the jobbers and spekulaters who now controle it, and put it into the hands uv pure men-"</p> 
               <p>"Sech ez Floyd, and Bright, and we," sejestid I, smilin sweetly.</p> 
               <p>"Then," continnerd he, a wettin his lips at the mouth uv the bottle, "we will not hev labered in vain. To do this and bring back the fraternal feelins uv yoar, this bluddy war must cease. Oh, Nasby, the dimekratik staits is bein invadid, the homes uv our Suthern brethren is bein violatid, ther niggers and household gods is bein torn from em, and onless we kin stand between em and rooin, will they, wen peese is restored, take us back and give us the politikle crums they cant use? Nary."</p> 
               <p>It wuz past 3 o'clock, wen I partid from that trooly grate man. He give me a gineral outline uv the plans uv the confedrits, and red me letters he hed reseevd from Tooms, Davis, et settry.</p>

               <opener>
                  <dateline>COLUMBUS, O., JUNE THE 21, '62.</dateline>
               </opener> 
               <p>I wuz onto my way to Columbus to attend the annooal gatherin uv the fatheful at that city, a dooty I hev religusly performd for over 30 yeres. Ther wuz but wun seet vakent in the car, and onto that I got down. Presently a gentleman carryin uv a karpit bag, sot down beside me, and we to-wunst commenst conversashen. After discussin the crops, the wether, et settry, I askt wher he resided.</p> 
               <p>"In Oberlin," sez he.</p> 
               <p>"Oberlin!" shreekt I. "Oberlin! wher Ablishnism runs rampant-wher a nigger is 100 per cent better ner a white man-wher a mulatto is a obgik uv pitty on account uv hevin white blood. Oberlin! that stonest the Dimekratik prophets, and woodent be gathered under Vallandygum's wings as a hen hawk gathereth chickens, at no price-Oberlin, that gives all the profits uv her college to the support uv the underground ralerode-"</p> 
               <p>"But," sez he.</p> 
               <p>"Oberlin," continyood I, "that reskoos niggers, and sets at defians the benifisent laws fer takin on em back to their kind and hevenly-minded masters-Oberlin"-</p> 
               <p>"My jentle frend," sez he, "Oberlin don't do nuthin uv the kind. Yoo've bin misinformd. Oberlin respex the laws, and hez now a body uv her galyent sons in the feeld a fightin to manetane the Constooshn."</p> 
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7106-00000005"/> 
               <p>"A fightin to maintane the Constooshn," retortid I. "My frend," (and I spoke impressivly) "no Oberlin man is a doin any sich thing. Oberlin never fit for no Constooshn. Oberlin commenst this war, Oberlin wuz the prime cause uv all the trubble. Wat wuz the beginnin uv it. Our Suthrin brethrin wantid the territories-Oberlin objcetid. They wantid Kansas fer ther blessid instooshn-Oberlin agin objecks. They sent colonies with muskits and sich, to hold the ter rytory-Oberlin sent 2 thowsand armed with Bibles and Sharp's rifles-two instooshns Dimocrisy cood never stand afore-and druv em out. They wantid Breckinridge fer President-Oberlin refused and elektid Linkin. Then they seceded, and why is it that they still hold out?"</p> 
               <p>He made no anser.</p> 
               <p>"Becoz," continyood I, transfixin him with my penetratin gaze, "Oberlin won't submit. We mite 2-day hev peese, ef Oberlin wood say to Linkin, "Resine!" and to Geff Davis, "Come up higher!" Wen I say Oberlin, understand it ez figgerative fer the entire Ablishn party, uv wich Oberlin is the fountin hed. There's wher the trubble is. Our Suthern brethren wuz reasonable. So long ez the dimocrisy controld things, and they got all they wanted, they wuz peeceable. Oberlin ariz-the dimocrisy wuz beet down, and they riz up agin it."</p>

The proud bird growd ez tho it slept on guano-its left wing dipt into the Pasific, its rite into the Atlantic, its beek thretened Kanady while his magestik tale cast a shadder ore the Gulf. Sich wuz the Eagle up to March, '61. Wat is his condishn now? His hed hangs, his tale droops, ther's no strength in his talons. Wat's the trubble? Oberlin.

I know not wat uthers may do, but ez fer me, I can't go. Upon a rigid eggsamninashen uv my fizzlekle man, I find it wood be wus ner madnis fer me 2 undertake a campane, to-wit:</p>

                  <p>After more advenchers than wood fill a book, I am here in Kanada, safe under the protectin tail uv the British Lion, where no draftin orfiser kin molest nor make me afraid. Halleloogy!</p> 
                  <p>I never shood hev taken this step, or ruther, the succeshun uv steps that brot me here, hed a good, sound, constooshnel doctor bin appinted Medical Eggsaminer, fer I hev twict ez menny diseases ez wood hev eggsemptid me, but I wuz afeerd the Eggsaminer woodent see em, ez he aint much uv a physician anyhow, besides, he votes the Union tickit, and hez, uv coarse, prejudisis. The Commissioner is a bluddy Ablishnist, and besides I owe him a store bill wich hez stood about 8 years. I protest agin all sich appintments.</p> 
                  <p>I left in company with 5 other invalids, wun nite a little after the "witchin hour uv 12 M.," ez Shakspeer hez it, and any wun beholdin our faces wood hev bin satisfide that sum "church-yard yawned" jest previously. We traveld all nite, "sustaned and soothed by an unfaltrin trust" in a bottle which I, with my usual 4site, took along, together with 2 and 1 third yards uv bolony sassige, wich I alluz use ez a thirst-provoker. We met no interrupshen till we got within 5 miles uv Toledo, (wich we did by 5 P. M., uv the next day, wich permit me to remark, was good travelin fer sich debillytatid cusses,) when we wuz stopt by a pickit gard uv the "Anti-draftin Invalid League," who remarkt, "Who goze there?" "A invalid," sez I. "A Peece invalid," sez he. "Ther aint no other kind," sez I, whereupon sez he, "yoor a man uv sence," a fact uv wich I hed bin long aware. I presentid my liqwid consiliater, when he informd me that Toledo wuz closely watcht, that escape by steemer was impossible, and that a small bote was our only chance. He took us to the lake shore, furnisht us a bote, and jest as the golden sun wuz a sinkin behind the golden horizon I bid my nativ land adoo.</p> 
                  <p>I need not dwell upon the perils uv that terrible passage. Suffice it 2 say that, fer invalids, we rowed well and finally landed at the little village uv Brest, wher we now air.</p> 
                   
                  <p>200 Peece men are here, and I must acknowledge that we are not treeted with that distinguished consideration usually accordid political eggsiles. Fer instance at the tavern where I board, the parler is partikelerly plesent, and I wuz a settin into it. In trips a girl, purty enuff fer a man whose taste was not vishiatid 2 eat. "Shel I shet down this window, sir?" sez she. "Why shet it down, jentle maid?" retorts I, lookin sweet onto her. "Because," replide she, "I thot, perhaps, the DRAFT was too much fer ye." A few slavish Kanajens who set there, laft. The landlord required a month's pay in advance, and a further deposit uv 25 cents per eggsile, as sekoority fer the pewter spoons, wich we hev at table. To cap the climacks, last nite a big nigger was put into eech uv our rooms, and we were forced to sleep with em, or okkepy the floor, wich I did. The cussid nigger laft all nite, in a manner trooly aggravatin to hear.</p>

               <p>I hev deserted, and am now a soljer uv the Confederacy. Jest ez soon ez our regiment struck Suthrin sile, I made up my mind that my bondage wuz drawin to a close-that I wood seeze the fust oppertoonity uv escapin to my nateral frends the soljers uv the sunny south. Nite before last I run the gard, wuz shot at twice, (reseevin two buckshot jest below the hind buttons uv my coat,) but by eggstrordinary luck I escaped. Had infantry bin sent after me I shood hev bin taken, for I am not a fast runner, but the Commandent uv the Post wuz new at the biznis, and innosently sent cavalry. Between the hossis they rode, and the stoppin to pick up them ez coodent stick onto ther flyin steeds, I hed no difficulty in outrunnin em.</p> 
               <p>At last I encounterd the pickits uv the Looisiana Pelicans, and givin myself up ez a deserter from the hordes uv the tyrant Linkin, wuz to wunst taken afore the Kernel. I must say in this conneckshun that I wuz surprised at the style uv uniform worn by the Pelicans. It consists uv a hole in the seet uv the pants, with the tale uv the shirt a wavin gracefully therefrom. The follerin colloquy ensood:</p> 
               <p>"To what regiment did yoo belong?"</p> 
               <p>"776th Ohio."</p> 
               <p>"Volunteer er draftid?"</p> 
               <p>"Draftid."</p> 
               <p>"Yoor name?"</p> 
               <p>"Nasby, Petroleum V."</p> 
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7106-00000008"/> 
               <p>I notist all this time the Kernel wuz eyein my clothes wistfully. I had jest drawd em and they wuz bran new. Sez the Kernel:</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Nasby I reseeve yoo gladly ez a recroot in the grand army uv Freedom. Ez yoo divest yoorself uv the clothes uv the tyrant, divest yerself uv watever lingrin affecshuns yoo may hev fer the land uv yer nativity, and ez yoo array yerself in the garb uv a Suthrin solier, try to fill yer sole with that Suthrin feelin that anymates us al. "Jones," sed he, addressin his Orderly, "is Thompson dead yit?"</p> 
               <p>"Not quite," sez the Orderly.</p> 
               <p>"Never mind," sez the Kernel, "he cant git well uv that fever; strip off his uniform and give it to Nasby, and berry him."</p> 
               <p>I judgd frum the style uv the uniforms I saw on the men around me, that I wood rather keep my own, but I sed nothin. When the Orderly returned with the deceest Thompson's uniform, I groaned innardly. There wuz a pare uv pants with the seat entirely torn away, and wun leg gone below the knee, a shoe with the sole off, and the straw he had wrapped around the other foot, and a gray woolen shirt. Sez the Kernel:</p> 
               <p>"Don't be afeerd uv me Nasby. Put on yer uniform rite here."</p> 
               <p>Reluctantly I pulled off my new dubble-soled boots, and I wuz petrified to see the Kernel kick off the slippers he wore, aud pull em on. I pulld off my pants-he put em on, and so on with every article uv dress I possest, even to my warm overkote and blankit. Sez the Kernel:</p> 
               <p>"These articles, Nasby, belongs to the Guvment, to which I shel akount fer them. Report yoorself to-wunst to Capt. Smith.</p> 
               <p>Ez I passed out the Lootenant-Kernel, Majer and Ajitent pulled me to wun side, and askt me "ef I coodent git three more to desert." Wun glanse at ther habillyments showd why they wuz so anxious fer deserters.</p> 
               <p>I candidly confess that Linkin takes better care uv his soljers than Davis does. The clothin I hev described. Instid uv reglar rashens we are allowed to eat jest whatever we kin steal uv the planters, and ez mite be expectid we hev becum wonderfully expert at pervidin, but ez the Pelicans hev bin campt here three months, the livin is gittin thin.

                  <item>3. Our pay is irregelar, and not jest ez good in quality ez cood be wished.</item> 
               </list> 
               <p>Fer instance. Our regiment hazzent reseevd a cent fer 8 months, and ther wuz much grumblin wich cum to the ears uv the Kernel.</p> 
               <p>"The men murmur do they," sed he to his Ajitent. "Their complaints is just, and they shel be paid their just dooze. Is ther a printin offis in the town?"</p> 
               <p>"Ther is," retorts the Ajitent.</p> 
               <p>"Go take possession uv it in the name uv the Confedrit States and seeze watever paper he my hev on hand. The faithful Pelicans must be paid."</p> 
               <p>The next day every wun uv the men hed his haversack stufft with money, each wun takin ez much ez he judgd he cood use. It does very well except that it gives the grocery keepers much trouble, as they take it by weight-a $1 bein wuth ez much ez a $20, ceptin that the $20 is a trifle the largest, and weighs more.</p> 
               <p>A incident. I wuz out on pikkit dooty, in the immejit visinnity uv a planter's barn, who hed bin suspectid uv Unionism. I saw a turkey, capchered it, and indulged all the way into camp into the<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7106-00000009"/> pleasant idee that, fer the first time in two months, I wood hev a stumic-distendin dinner. Ez I entered camp I met the Kernel, who, ez his eagle eye caught the proud bird I held spoke, sayin:</p> 
               <p>"Ha! a turkey. Wher gottist thow him?</p> 
               <p>"I capcherd him at Johnson's," replied I.</p> 
               <p>"Fat and young," mused he, feelin uv him, and then lookin up thus he did say: "My venerable patriot, (he allooded to my gray hairs,) this bird belonged to a Union man, and all sich property taken by the army, belongs uv coarse, 2 the Goverment. Yoo will 4thwith take it my quarters.</p> 
               <p>Not hevin eaten anything fer 18 hours, I determined to make wun effort for my turky. Sez I. "Admittin the bird belongs to the Goverment," sez I, "I may retane him I suppose, by payin his valyoo," and I tendered him a handful uv the money we bed reseevd that mornin.</p> 
               <p>"Not so fast, my aged hero," sed he, "the Guverment needs turkeys more than it does money. Money we kin make, but yoo must be aware, that, without a material alterashen in our anatomikle structure the makin uv a turkey by us is a impossibility. Leave the property at my quarters." * * * * * * * *</p> 
               <p>That nite I passed the Kernel's quarters. Ther wuz a sound uv revelry within, and the odor uv a Thanksgivin dinner assaild my nostrils. The next mornin I saw the Kernel's dorg a chawin the bones uv that Goverment turkey.</p>

               <p>I consoomd 2 hours uv the Suthrin Confedracy's time, and a 12 foot board, assertainin the eggsact increese uv misery wich I am engoyin. With the above result.</p> 
               <p>Wen I wuz draftid I wuz not particularly dissatisfied. My posishen wuz becomin precarious.

I whaled her in the afternoon when she wuz tired, and she whaled me in the mornin, when she wuz fresh. Had I expendid the energy and strength consoomd in whalin Looizer Jane in choppin cord-wood, I mite hev ownd a farm.

Sence my enrollment in the ranks uv the Pelicans, the romance uv the thing hez departid. Nothin 2 eat, nothin to wear, no money, and hard work. This is our fix. The plump, rosy Nasby is no more-anserin 2 his name is a lean indiviggooal, upon whose nose a bullet cood be split.</p> 
               <p>I determined to better myself by marriage. The idee wuz sejestid by our second corpral, who interdoost me 2 a widder lady who lived jest out uv town-the owner uv 2 thousand akers. The akers inspired me, and I prest my soot with vigger and arder. In a week the thing wuz dun. I caught the regimental chaplin sober enuff wun nite, and we wuz married.</p> 
               <p>Fer a day I wuz a haypy man. I contemplatid MY plantashen and wept teers uv goy. Suddenly my happinis bustid. The Sargent informed me that my wife-the future sharer uy my goys and sorrers-wuz a OCTOROON, one 8th NIGGER!-that she wuz a slave left in charge by her mistress, and that the corpral did it jest fer a goak! A purty goak to play upon a Dimekrat! Nasby marryin a Nigger!</p> 
               <p>My views hev changed on the slavery question. Amalgamashen is the cuss uv slavery. The blacks hev bleached and bleached, until it is almost impossible to distinguish the slave from his owner. Wen the mix becomes wuss, wat then? Wen the slave is ez white ez his<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7106-00000010"/> master, wat are yoo goin to do? Slavery, like a man with a tapeworm, hez within itself the elements nessessary to its destruction. Amalgamashen is the tape-worm uv slavery.</p>

               <p>I hed a conversashen tother day with a fellow-defender uv the rites uv the South, wich ruther startled me. I wuz a holding 4th with my yoosual ability on the blessidnis uv slavery, and wus, uv coarse, quotin hevy frum skripter to defend my position. A member uv our company interruptid me by remarkin that Nacher hed spiled a great rascal in me, by not contribbitin a suffishent amount uv brains. He continued his remarks:</p> 
               <p>"Nasby," sez he, "I know slavry is a cuss-a onmittygatid cuss. I hed 18 niggers and they kept me as poor as a skim milk cheese. The hogs eat the corn, the niggers eat the hogs, and I lived on what they left. To defend my property in these niggers we seceshed and startid a new Guvment. The new Guvment took the corn, the hogs, the niggers, and finally took me. My oldest dawter run off with wun defender uv the flag, my wife with another, and my youngest childern is livin with sum niggers 2 old fer the Guverment to take. I've had my share uv rites, I hev. Ef there's any more comin to me, give em to some poor person as needs em. I'm jest more'n rollin in a perfooshn uv that kind uv wealth."</p> 
               <p>"But," sez I-</p> 
               <p>"Ther aint no buts," sez he. "Yoo 're a Northern man, and don't hev niggers. Don't defend nigger. Ef I hev the itch I may sware that itch is a good thing, but wat sence is ther in yoor swarin it, on-asked and fer nothin. Sech stratejy borders closely on lunacy. Let us squeeze our own biles-don't yoo do it gratooitous. Appolygize fer yer own sins-don't shoulder ourn. I may be mean for my own profit, but to act dirty fer another man's use, and hev him kick ye fer doin it, is a lick ahead uv my comprehenshun. Durn all sech men."</p> 
               <p>And he stawkt indignently away.</p> 
               <p>I hev reseevd more letters from frends in my wunst happy but now distractid home than I kin anser separately. I shel do it all to-wunst, thus:</p> 
               <p>JOHN M.-Shoemakin wood be a splendid biznis here, only the aint no leather. Practice haff-solin with straw before yoo start.</p> 
               <p>W. G.-The pay uv a member uv the Mississippi Legislater is $6 per diem, evry day, paid in Confedrit 30 per cent bonds, redeemable at the pleasure uv the Guvment any time within two centuries. Come along. Almost anybody kin git offis in this state.</p> 
               <p>P. N.-Ther is a good openin fer a Watchmaker here. I am the only mechanic in this section uv Mississippy. I fixt the Kernel's watch, yisterday-forged a mane-spring out uv a baynet, and fer a chane used a fiddle-string. It don't jest keep time, but ez it ticks it ansers to bet on poker. Fetch sum lard ile-tar won't work on watches even in this warm climate.</p> 
               <p>AMOS.-The success uv our Guvment is shoor. Finances hez trubbled us, but our Sekretary uv the Treasury hez bought 2 fast printin presses, and a lot up a paper on tick, and we now git all we want.</p>

               <p>A man who duz things frum prinsipple kin stand a good deal. I kin. Sustaned and soothed by an unfaltrin trust in the rychusnis uv the Suthrin coz, I stuck to my beluvd rejyment, the Loozeaner Pelikins, with a tenassity wich I did not dreme I possest. But ther is a pint beyond wich human nacher can not go. I endoord hunger and cold-I saw the rags drop off my muskeler limbs wun by wun-I murmered not. But, wen the pataloons wuz awl gone-wen my cos-<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7106-00000011"/> toom wus a blanket and wun shoe-I applide fer new pants, and the Quartermaster onfeelinly remarkt that my dress wuz all rite; that hereafter my costoom wuz to be adoptid ez the uniform uv the rejyment-I felt that desershun wuz no longer a crime, and I deserted. It is entirely onnessary to rekount awl I endoored in makin my eskaip. Suffice it to say that at Columbus I stript the klose off uv an innebryatid solger, and maid my way to Amanda township. My old Demokratic friends did not kno me, and ez I expected to borry money uv them I deemed it best not to make myself knone.</p> 
               <p>They were suspishus uv my bloo kote, at fust, until wun uv them remarkt how I likd the serviss?</p> 
               <p>To wich I anserd, "Dam the serviss!</p> 
               <p>"Don't admire fitin fer the nigger, eh?"</p> 
               <p>"Not any," sez I.</p> 
               <p>"Why not desert?" sez he.</p> 
               <p>"I hev deserted," sez I.</p> 
               <p>In a instant the aspeck uv things wuz changd. A jug wuz prodoost, and they awl shook hands. Wun, more richer nor the rest, handed me a treasury note uv $10, sayin, "You may need it."</p> 
               <p>I replide that, as a general thing I wood hev nothin to do with any paper that bore the babboon likeness uv the usurper and tyrent Linkin, but under the sirkumstances I wood endoor it until I cood get it changd into Injeany munny. They took up a kollekshun to wunst, fer my benefit, wich amounted to $43.</p> 
               <p>Jest at this pint wun uv em asked me to what rejyment I belonged.</p> 
               <p>I replide the Loozeaner Pelikins.</p> 
               <p>"Loozeaner!" sed another, "why that's a Confedracy rejyment aint it?"</p> 
               <p>"To be sure," sez I.</p> 
               <p>"And air yoo a deserter frum a Suthrin rejyment," sez the benevelent old butternut who hed invested $10, in the deserter biznis.</p> 
               <p>"Sartin," sez I.</p> 
               <p>Scezin me by the throte, he ejackelated, "Give me my money you swindler!" And with a unanimity trooly surprisin they awl yelled, "Give me my money you swindler-you got it under false pretences." Hevin the munny safe in my pokkit, I took these compliments with ekanimity, sidlin out and gettin away ez soon ez possible.</p> 
               <p>I am disappointed in Amandy. Frum wat I had heard I hed supposed they were kind to deserters. I found that it makes much diffrense wich side you desert from.</p>

                  <dateline>IN THE HANDS UV LINKIN HIRELINES, HOSKINVILL, MARCH 26, '63.</dateline>
               </opener> 
               <p>I am in durance vile. Wunst more the tree uv liberty is uprooted in my person-wunst more hev the unrightous tools uv the monster Linkin seized my venerable form and incarceratid it in a basteel. So menny times hev I bin imprisoned fer opinion's sake, that ef I kin get a pardner with capital, I shel go into the marterin biznis. But 2 my narrashen. When the news reechd me uv the bold stand made by the heroes uv Hoskinvill, in opposition to the draft, I determined to throw myself "in2 the deadly and imminent breech," ez W. Shakspeer hez it. I made my way to Hoskinville, wuz reseeved with the wildest enthoosiasm by the patriots ther assembled, and wuz to-wunst placed in command uv the forces. It wuz a prowd day fer Nasby! Before me stood, leaned and laid, (akordin ez they hed emptied their canteens, wich wuz all filled with new fitin whisky,) two hundred uv the brave sons uv Hoskinvill, from the rich, hory-headed farmer, (uv whom I promptly borrerd 80 odd dollars,) to the gay and sportive yooth uv 16, all consoomd with onquenchable arder. I drilled sech uv them ez were suffishently sober to keep their feet, nigh onto two days, amoozin ourselves into the intervals with passin resolooshens denouncin Linkin, and pledgin ourselves to resist even un2 death.</p> 
               <p>At last our scouts brot us intelligence that two companies uv bloocoated hirelins wuz within 9 miles uv us, approachin at the rate uv wun and a half miles per hour. "Ha!" shoutid I, the foe! they comest! Now men uv Hoskinville and visinnity, show yourselves<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7106-00000012"/> men!" Accordinly another meetin wuz immejitly organizd, Chairman and Sekretary appointid, and a resolution passed, pledgin the meetin to resist even un2 death, the proseedins to be published in all the Dimekratic papers. We adjourned, and I wuz about drawin on em up in line uv battle, and wuz instructin uv em to hold the muzzle uv the gun from, instid uv toward theirselves when they fired, and wuz explainin to others the nesessity uv puttin the powder down the barrel before the ball, and makin sech other arrangements ez a wise and prudent commander determined to conker or die, would, when suthin like a dozen uv em ejakilates:</p> 
               <p>"Gineral!"</p> 
               <p>Drawin myself up to my full hite I anserd, "Wat!"</p> 
               <p>"Gineral," sez wun uv the oldest, "we are not advantajesly postid. Wood it not be better on the hill," sed he, pintin to a very high hill jest east uv the town. I perseeved at a glance the strategik importance uv the position, as the enemy wuz approachin from the west, and I ordered the men to deploy by squadrons in open right file platoons, and okepy the summit. Never wuz a order obeyed with greater alacrity. I hev a reputashen fer speed-I kin rival the courser and outstrip the jentle gazelle, but they shot past me like a arrow. Their enthoosiasm carried em to the top uv the hill, and how much further I hev no menes uv knowin, ez when I reached the top uv the hill not wun uv the resisters wuz in site.</p> 
               <p>I wuz arrested that nite. In vain I protested that I wuz a Methodist preacher sellin fruit trees-my nose wich blossoms ez the lobster and a copy uv the Noo York Day Book I hed in my pocket wuz ginst me, and I wuz to-wunst confined. My feelins is hurt.</p>

               <p>Dimocrisy hezn't ez many hobbies now ez it used to hev, and it is somewhat difficult to keep the people strung up the proper pitch. Nigger is all the capital we hev left, and its rayther tough work to keep the old machine runnin. In Union and Orange their blood dident bile when I told em that 40,000 niggers wuz on their way to that section-nary bile. So I hed recourse to strategy. Last Friday nite I prokoored some lamp-black and lard-ile, and applyin it to my classic countenance, and my laber-staned hands, transformd myself into a villainous contraband. Then I proceedid after night to the south end uv the township, and at day-light commenst goin north. The skeein workt beautiful. At every house the follerin conversashen wood ensoo:</p> 
               <p>"Hello, Cuff, wher yoo from?"</p> 
               <p>"Tennisee, massa."</p> 
               <p>"Wher you goin?"</p> 
               <p>I'se gwine to stop sum 'ers 'bout heah."</p> 
               <p>"Who sent you North."</p> 
               <p>"Kurnel Niblin, and de ablishners ob de 21st."</p> 
               <p>"Dam Niblin and yoo too. Git!"</p> 
               <p>Wich I alluz did. Then goin back I'd take another road, stealin sich trifles ez shirts and stockins, and usin sich other means uv arousin our people 2 a realizin sense uv the cuss uv a floatin nigger populashen, ez sejestid themselves to my mind. It became a serious thing though, fer on the fourth day so many hed seen me, that they reely sposd the nigger invashen had commenst and they hunted me. I run a mile, and findin they were gainin on me, darted into the woods, washed, and come out ez the original Nasby.</p> 
               <p>Lord! what an enthoosiastic meetin we had that night. Their faith in the nigger invasion hed bin shaky, but it was now firm. They had seen em. Wun had seen 38, that day, uv wich number he wuz proud to say he had killed 5. I larfed innardly, but held my peece. Desepshen is justifiable now and then. I kin do it. I only borrered $4 in Union.</p>

               <p>I then held forth from this text:-"Whar hev ye laid him?" I statid that the person I referred to wuz the marterd Vallandygum, and I, in behaff uv a outraged Dimocrisy, demanded uv the tyrant Linkin, "Whar hev yoo laid him?"A unconvertid individooal sed, "He's laid him out! "wich remark cost him a broken head I went on to show why our saint hed bin martered. It wuz becoz he wuz a Dimocrat-becoz he dared to exercise the rites garanteed to every American, exceptin Ablishnists and niggers, aboosin the Guverment. Fer this and nuthin else wuz he eggsiled. "My frends," sez I, drawin myself up to my full hite, and lookin ez much like Fernandy Wood ez possible, "I am willin to be marterd. I denounce this war as unholy, unconstooshnel, unrighteous and unmittygated. It is nuthin less than a invashen uv Dimocratik states, fer the sole purpus uv freein niggers. Linkin is a tyrant, Burnside a tool, order 38 a relik uv barberism, and I will resist the enrollment, the conskripshen and the tax. Hooray fer Jeff Davis.</p> 
               <p>Our class meetin wuz more interestiner than ever. One old, white headed brother sed that at times his way was dark, and his pathway gloomy. Wunst he wuz very near becomin a infiddle. He reely be lieved at one time that the nigger was human, and wunst he voted fer a Republican road Supervisor. But he hed repented, and was, he trusted, forgiven. His mind wuz now easy, and he should vote the whole Dimocratic tickit.</p> 
               <p>Two backsliders who scratched their tickits last fall, confest theirsin, publicly. I exhorted em two hours, fined em a gallon uv whisky apeece, and took em into full communion. The whisky will be devotid to the missionary service. wich is me.</p> 
                
               <p>This is a deliteful feeld uv labor. At the Corners they give me sech flooids ez I need, at all the doggeries but one, and at that one they trust me wich amounts to the same thing.

               <p>I preached last Sunday from the text, "Break every yoke and let the opprest go free." I went on to show that this text had no reference watever to niggers. Niggers wuz ordained 2 be bondmen fron the very day Noah took a overdose uv the Great Happyfier, and cust Canaan. But the text, like the Deklarashen uv Independense, and the ever blessid Constitooshn, wuz made solely fer white men. It hed undoubted reference to the payin uv debts. Wat heavier yoke is ther than notes? and who is more opprest than he who pays ten per cent? "Burn yer notes, and let yer debtors go free," wood be a more correcter readin uv the passage.</p> 
               <p>In our biznis meetin in the afternoon, the question uv the draft wuz considered. It wuz plain that the enrolement cood not be prevented. The enrolein orfisers hed managed to do it, and it wuz a sertinty that every name atwixt 18 and 45 wuz down. And we were also satisfied that the draft cood be enforst, and there4, it behooves us to make it ez light ez possible, more espeshly, ez when wun uv us is draftid, he will hev 2 go, not hevin the nessary 300 dollars. It is here ez it is in all excloosivly dimecratic communities, the grocery keepers absorb all the capital. The follerin resolutions were past:</p> 
               <p>WHERAS, Our nashen is involved in a horrible, fratrisidle war, the same bein unholy and waged solely 2 free the nigger and enslaiv the white man, wich is therefore our duty to oppose the same, therefore be it</p> 
               <p>RESOLVED, That we are in favor uv raisin our quota by volunteerin, and hereby urge the same.</p> 
               <p>RESOLVED, That the consider the employment uv niggers ez soljers ez not only justifiable, but highly commendable.</p> 
               <p>RESOLVED, That a committee be appinted to sekoor the settlement uv 2 hunderd families uv niggers in this township, excloosivly fer volunteerin purposes.</p> 
               <p>The resolooshens wuz past, and the committees appointed.</p> 
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7106-00000017"/> 
               <p>The very next day we heerd uv Vicksburg and Gettysburg. I towunst blew the horn and got my flock together-told em the news, and offerd the following resolooshens:</p> 
               <p>WHEREAS, Our beloved country is involved in a bloody war aginst rebels and traitors-</p> 
               <p>(A old man interrupted me sayin "W-h-a t?" Payin no attenshen, I proceeded.)</p> 
               <p>And in sich a crisis the dooty uv every troo citizen is to sustain the Guverment, therefore, be it</p> 
               <p>RESOLVD, That the Dimocrisy are, ez they alluz hev bin, in faver uv a viggerus prossekooshen uv the war.</p> 
               <p>RESOLVD, That our confidence in the great Vallandygum is unabated, and bleevin him to be the only actooal war man in Ohio shel give him our harty support.</p> 
               <p>RESOLVD, That the reports uv troubles in Ohio and Ingeany is lies, got up to deseeve the people.</p> 
               <p>The resolooshens wuz past, tho I had to tell em twice to vote for em. We immejitly hunted up 2 enrollin orfisers who we tarred and feathered sum weeks ago, jest after Hooker wuz defeated by Lee, at Chanslerville, wen we spozd our Suthern brethrin wood triumph, and giv em a public dinner. Ef all the leaders of the Dimocrisy were ez sagashus ez me, the old party wood hev smooth sailin. Alas! how few hev the gigantik intellek uv Nasby! I hev written to my frends advisin em to shift ez soon ez possible.</p>

               </list> 
               <p>I preecht frum this text, "O mi sole why art thow cast down." I told em we wuz cast down becoz uv Meed's whippin Lee, becoz uv Grant's takin Vixburg, and Banks' takin Port Hudson. That's what's the matter with us. That's what hez cast a shadder over owr countnansis, and changd the hew uv our nozis from the brilyunt crimsun to the gastly bloo! The flattrin hopes uv a successful invashen uv the North is dasht-likewise the releef uv Vixburg, and now to fill our cup uv sorrer, Jon Morgin's command is destroyd. But still my frends ther is a silver linin 2 evry clowd, wich is poetry. There is wun ray uv hope, amid all this gloom. I allood 2 the late constooshnal demonstrashens in Noo York. Ther wuz a victory. The draft books wuz destroyed and the draft wuz stopped. But therwuz a bigger triumph than stoppin the draft. Niggers wuz killd-the prowd Anglo-saxn riz in his mite and stoned the niggers! Halleloojy. At this pint sum uv the awjence becum sleepy, and to arowse them I becum faseshus. Why, sez I, wuz the Dimocrisy who mauld the niggers in Noo York, a most ennerjetic and perseverin people? Becoz, anserd I, they left no stone unturnd 2 effect their purpus. The ijee uv interdoosin conundrums in2 the pullpit is orijenel with me. I closed by exhortin uv em too stand firm. Ef we kin elect Vallandigum we may yet check the Fedral Guvment in its victorus carere. With Ohio all rite fer constooshnal rites, the game uv subjoogashen wood be playd out. Let us, sed I, never falter nor faint, but press onnard 2 to the mark uv our hy callin. Ez the Isrelites threw down the walls uv Gerryko by blowin ram's horns, so kin we by blowin our horns throw down the walls uv this Abolishn Gerryko.

               <p>I hev jest returned from a visit to our persekootid saint Valandygum. The marter wuz holdin a resepshun at the Clifton House, wen I arrove. He caught site uv me ez soon ez I entered the room, and he rusht in2 my arms, and droopin his head on2 my heavin buzm, weept aloud:</p> 
               <p>"Marterd saint!" sez I, with a voice tremulous with emoshen.</p> 
               <p>"Sufferer fer truth!" sez he, and then this trooly grate man whispered, "Jest keep in this posishn a minnit-the artist uv the Noo York Illustratid Flapdoodle is makin a sketch uv us," wich we did, standin locked in2 each others arms, and weepin profoosely fer 15 minits. It wuz exhaustin and tiresum, but fer the cause I endoord it. The picter will appear in next week's Flapdoodle, headed "The 2 grate minds uv the Age! Affectin meetin uv Vallandygum and Nasby!" The matter akompnyin the picter will be written by Valandygum and myself, he writin wat relates 2 hisself, and I wat relates 2 myself. We kin do ourselves justis. After the Eastern delegashen hed gone thro the serrymony uv kissin his feet, wich cleaned em, he dismist em, and we wuz alone.</p> 
                
               <p>"Nasby," sez the great C. L., "how is things in my nativ state?"</p> 
               <p>"Squally," sez I.</p> 
               <p>"Wat wuz the pervalin sentiment uv the people as to my eggsile?"</p> 
               <p>"They was extreemly glad uv it."</p> 
               <p>"The akount uv my prostrashen-my untold suffrins, et settry, wich I hed publisht in the papers; did that not affect them?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, they laft."</p> 
               <p>"Did not the affectin akount uv the wife uv my buzm, and my cher ub babes a jinin me here 2 share my lonely eggsile, move em?"</p> 
               <p>"Nary move."</p> 
               <p>"Nasby, the peeple is stun. But I'll fetch em. Nil despritrando is my motto."</p> 
               <p>After a few moments uv profound silence, he resoomd. "I must be Guvner, fer how else kin we prevent the subjugashen uv the Dimekratic staits. Elect me and therd be no more trouble about drafts, onless we shood git involved in a war with the United States. The Confedracy wood be recognised, Ohio wood go with the South, and slavery wood be interdoost, and as we woodent hev eny further use er em, poor men woodent be allowed to vote, making me perpetooal Guvernor. Nasby, we must succeed."</p> 
               <p>"Certinly. But we're in a tite plais. Oor speekers is embarist. It takes a gigantik intellek to bring the pints 2gether. A anicdote. A spritely boy wunst put 200 eggs in a nest fer a hen to set on. Sez his maternal mother. "My son why puttist thou so many eggs under the hen. She canst not kiver em.' "Certinly she canst not, but thunder, I want to see her spread herself." Jest so. Our speakers are in the same fix. The outside egg in the Dimekratik nest is opposition to the war. Tother side uv the nest 200 eggs distant, is the support uv the war. To kiver em all requires great stretchin capasity.</p> 
               <p>"Troo, 2 troo. But we must mix it and trust to luck. In loyal counties stuff em with dilooted patriotism-in OUR counties pure secesh. The people is jest ez gullible now ez ever they wuz."</p> 
               <p>I left the patriot and sage much comforted.</p>

               <p>Dostest thou bleeve that Vallandigum wuz sent in2 the world to save the Dimocratic party; that in doin it he wuz arestid at Dayton, tride afore Ponteus Burnside, and sent sowth; that after 3 months he riz agen in Canydy, whense he shel cum ez soon ez hese electid, and Pooh goes after him with 300 thowsan? Dostest thow take the Crisis?</p>

               <p>I preeched yisterdy frum this text: "Verely I say unto yoo, it is moar blesseder toe give than toe reseeve."-Joab 17, 313 to 21, incloosiv.</p> 
               <p>The inspird riter hed, no dout, the Dimecratic party in his mind's I, wen he rit them wurds uv wisdom. Experence hez shode the trooth uv them sentens, and ef it hadent youd be bound to bleeve it, coz I, yoor paster, sez so, wich is Dimocrisy. To illustriat we shell inquire:</p> 
               <p>1. Wat is givin?</p> 
               <p>Givin is givin, wich is a suffishently cleer explanashen fer all practikle perpuses.</p> 
               <p>2. Wen shood we giv?</p> 
               <p>This pint reqwires moar eloocydashen. We must giv alluz, fer it is moar blessider toe giv ner toe reseeve. The Dimocrisy hez alluz bin scriptooral in this partikeler. Wen the Sowth wantid Misoory,<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7106-00000020"/> we giv it. Wen she wantid a Fugytiv Slaiv Law, we giv it. Wen she wantid Texis, and Kansas, and Nebrasky, we giv it, halleloogy. Wen she wantid Bookannon, we giv it, and wen she demandid Duglisses hed, we giv it, fer it is moar blessider to give ner it is to reseeve.</p> 
               <p>3. Why shood we giv?</p> 
               <p>Becoz it pays. So long ez the Dimocrisy hed the power uv givin all wuz well. The Sowth hevin all it wanted wuz contentid, and evrythin went on smooth and plesent like. Nacher intendid em to rool, and us uns to serve, and we wuz satisfide, and so wuz they. Such offisis ez wuz benethe em, they tost to us, and all wuz peese. It wuz normel.</p> 
               <p>4. Wat hez bin the consekencis uv not givin?</p> 
               <p>My frens, seest thou yon Post orifise? A abolishnist sets there. And woe is us the plasis we onct did fill all ore the land, we fill no moar. And wus. Ther is war-the North hez rebeld aginst the Dimocrisy, and to-day, yoor sons is being dragged to the tentid feeld, to be offered up a sakrifis to the fell sperit uv "not givin." Oh, my frens, we stumbled ourselvs. We faild to giv wunst, and that failyour wuz fatle. Wen we in our pride defide the Sowth at Charleston, we sinned, and air now payin fer it. O hed we all yoonited in given, then-hed we follered presedent and got down into the dust then, all wood hev bin well.</p> 
               <p>We dedooce from the foregoin the follerin grate trooth, to-wit, viz: Suffrin alluz follers sin. Nether duz the sinner git the price uv his sin. The demon uv Abolishnism, er NOT GIVEN, wich is sinonymus, held afore the eyes of Duglis the dazzlin prospek uv Northrin votes. But lo! wen Duglis hed took the fatel step, the votes wuz Linkin's, and the Post orfises wuz Linkin's, and the Dimocrisy supped on sorrer, and brekfasted on woe.</p> 
               <p>Ther is, my brethren, a hevy cuss on Not givin. "Wo unto yoo fer a stif-necked and rebelyus people." Abiram 31, 5, xlp. In the originel Rooshen it is "stif-backt" instid uv "stif-neckt," wich makes it mene Massychusetts. They wood never bend a inch, they hed no limbernis, and with head up, instid uv down-with backs strate, instid uv curvd, they insisted on bein men ez well ez Virginny, thus forcin the Sowth to take up arms to bend em into ther nateral posishen.</p> 
               <p>My frens, this war is a effort on the part uv the Sowth to put down these rebels aginst the grate prinsiple uv GIVEN. That's all they want, and wen they git it they'll stop, I make no doubt. Then breethrin, let us pray fer their sukcess-let us imytait our marterd saint, Vanlandigum, who is a exel far away, and 2 the xtent uv our ability ferther the grate coz. Let Noo Ingland be got under, Sumner, and Waid, and Giddins, and Gim Ashly, and Oin Luvgoy, hung-the grate Davis President, with Fernando Wood and Vandaldigum in his Cabynit, then will ther be for us peece, and harmony, and good will, and post orifises. Let wat I hev sed sink deep in2 yoor harts, wen the contribooshen box cums around, remember that "it is moar blesseder 2 give than 2 reseeve." So mote it be.</p>

               <p>Feelin it a sakred dooty I oad the coz uv Dimocrisy and fre speech, (on awl subgeks not interferin with Dimocrisy ez it hez bin, ez it is, or ez it may be,) I visyted Camp Dennyson, wich is naimd after a Abbolishnist, to use my stentorin voyse fer Vanlandigum, among the payrold prizners. It wuz a bammy mornin in September, wen I arriv, and procoorin admishen, I set to work to onct. Noticin a cupple uv duzen uv a playin poker, 1 cent anty, I jedged by a instink I hev that ther wuz a gud field fer sowin dimycratik seed. Advansin, I sed, "My frends!" "Wat," sed wun uv em, takin advantij uv the interrupshen to slip a ace er 2 up his koat sleeve.</p>

Finelly, wun uv em sez, "Boys, we aint the prizners this feller's after. Johnson's Island's wher he want to go to find his frends." "Yes," sed another, "and to git thair yu go by water," whereupon thsee frends seezed me and draggd me thro a hoss troff 15 er a hunderd times. Then they pourd cole ile over me, and wuz a goin to set afire to dry me, ez they sed, but I broak and fled, pursood by 1000 uv these infooriatid demuns.

               <p>Paul the apossel, on his way frum Geroosalem 2 Damaskus, to persekoot the Crischens, seed a dazzlin lite wich struck him blind. The old Dimocrisy on the 13th uv October, on its way to Glory, to persekoot the nigger, seed a lite wich nocked it crazy. Wen yu've suckd a orange dry, natrelly yoo fling away the peel, and if the froot provd sour and bitter instid uv sweet, yoo fling it a good dele further, bein disgustid. Valandigum's marterdom wuz our orange-we suckt it wiggerously; but alas! quinine is sweetnis compared to it; to wit: I fling away the wuthless pele.</p> 
               <p>Myself and flock is now all war Dimecrats. We hev alluz bin. We never agreed with the extreemists uv our party, and we remaned in the organnyzation, only becoz, ez members thereof, we cood restrane it frum doing mischif. We wer zelus in the support uv Valandigum, and workt hard to elect him, only that, being his supporters, and hevin electid him, we cood curb him.</p> 
               <p>Therefore, all our apparent opposishen to the war, wuz reely its most effishent support. I hope the peeple will see it.</p> 
               <p>At a biznis meetin uv our church yisterdy afternoon, the follerin resolooshen wuz past:</p> 
               <p>WAREAS, Dimocrisy flurishes best wen it is successful; and ware as, it is a tender flower that don't bare the chillin frosts uv adversity much; and wareas, the peeple hev shode by the pekoolyer stile uv ther votin that they don't like Valandigum ner his prinsipples; and wareas, the peeple is moar use to us than Valandigum, therefore, be it</p> 
               <p>RESOLVD, That Valandigum never wuz a representativ uv Dimocratic idee.</p> 
               <p>RESOLVD, That we do not endors his vews, or approve his acts, and nevur did.</p> 
               <p>RESOLVD, That onist old A. Linkin, by arrestin uv him, and there- by forsin uv us into committin polittikle sooiside by nominatin uv him, wuz gilty uv a heenus sin.</p> 
               <p>RESOLVD, That we aint ez much consernd about our habis corpusses ez we wuz afore the elecshen.</p> 
               <p>RESOLVD, That the war fer the Union must go on, until its enemis is subjoogatid, and the banner uv buty and glory waves over every stait, and the Dimocratic committis uv the varius staits be requestid to procoor a suffishent number uv banners, and appint sub-committis to wave em.</p> 
               <p>RESOLVD, That we air in favor uv subjoogashen, emansipashen, confiscashen, taxashen, conscripshen, exterminashen, nigger enlistments, and ef ther is anythin else the peeple desire, let em write us (post pade) and weel pass the nessary resolooshen.</p>

               <p>I felt it my dooty to visit Washinton. The misarable condishon the Dimocrisy find themselvs into sinse the elecshen, makes it nessary that suthin be did, and therefore I determind to see wat cood be effectid by a persnel intervew with the Presdent.</p> 
               <p>Interdoosin myself, I opened upon him delikitly, thus:</p> 
               <p>"Linkin," sez I, "ez a Dimocrat, a free-born Dimocrat, who is prepard to die with neetnis and dispatch, and on short notis, fer the inalienable rite uv free speech-knoin also that you er a goriller, a feendish ape, a thirster after blud, I speek."</p> 
               <p>"Speek on," sez he.</p> 
               <p>"I am a Ohio Dimocrat," sez I, "who hez repoodiatid Valandigum."</p> 
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7106-00000024"/> 
               <p>"Before or sinse the elecshin, did yoo repoodiate him?" sez he.</p> 
               <p>"Sinse," retortid I.</p> 
               <p>"I thot so," sed he. "I would hev dun it too, hed I bin you," continnered he with a goriller-like grin.</p> 
               <p>"We air now in favor uv a wiggerus prosecushen uv the war, and we want you to so alter yoor polisy that we kin act with yoo, corjelly," sez I.</p> 
               <p>"Say on," sez he.</p> 
               <p>"I will. We don't want yoo to change yoor polisy, materially. We air modrit. Anxshus to support yoo we ask yoo to adopt the follerin trifling changis:</p> 
               <p>Restoar to us our habis corpusses, as good ez new.</p> 
               <p>Arrest no moar men, wimmin and children, fer opinyun's saik.</p> 
               <p>Repele the ojus confisticashen bill, wich irrytaits the Suthern mind and fires the Suthern hart.</p> 
               <p>Do away with drafts and conskripshens.</p> 
               <p>Revoak the Emansipashen proclamashen, and give bonds that you'll never ishoo a nother.</p> 
               <p>Do away with tresury noats and sich, and pay nuthin but gold.</p> 
               <p>Protect our dawters frum nigger eqwality.</p> 
               <p>Disarm yoor nigger soljers, and send back the niggers to ther owners to conciliate them.</p> 
               <p>Offer to assoom the war indetednis uv the South, and plej the Guverment to remoonerate our Suthrin brethren fer the looses they hev sustaned in this onnatral war.</p> 
               <p>Call a convenshen uv Suthern men and sech gileless Northern men ez F. Peerce, J. Bookannun, Fernandough Wood and myself, to agree upon the terms uv re-union.</p> 
               <p>"Is that all," sez the goriller.</p> 
               <p>"No," sez I promptly. "Ez a garantee uv good faith to us, we shel insist that the best haff uv the orifises be given to Dimocrats who repoodiate Valandigum. Do this, Linkin, and yoo throw lard ile on the trubbled waters. Do this and yoo rally to yoor support thowsends uv noble Dimocrats, who went out uv offis with Bookannon, and hev bin gittin ther whisky on tick ever sinse. We hev maid sakrifises. We hev repoodiatid Valandigum-we care not ef he rots in Canady-we are willin to jine the war party reservin to ourselvs the poor privilidg uv dictatin how and on wat prinsipples it shel be carried on. Linkin! Goriller! Ape! I hev dun."</p> 
               <p>The President replide that he wood give the matter serious considerashen. He wood menshen the idee uv resinin to Seward, Chais and Blair, and wood addres a serculer to the Postmasters et settry, an and see how menny uv em wood be willin to resine to acommodai Dimocrats. He hed no dout sevral wood do it to-wunst. "Is ther any littel thing I kin do fer you?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothin pertikler. I wood accept a small Post orifis, if sitooatid within ezy range uv a distilry, My politikle daze is well nigh over. Let me but see the old party wunst moar in the assendency-let these old eyes onct moar behold the Constooshn ez it is, the Union ez it wuz, and the Nigger ware he ought 2 be, and I will rap the mantel uv privit life arownd me, and go in2 delirum tremens happy.

               <p>I preeched yisterdy, frum the folleain text: "What shell we do to be saivd?"</p> 
               <p>This, my brethrin, is a important enquiry. Speakin ez a Dimocrat who fer thirty yeres hez never scratched a tikkit-vewin things frum a Dimocratic stand-pint, I hev no hesitashen in sayin that we need savin in a eminent degree. The dark waives of fanattysism wich wuz mear rippels in 1856, were mountin high in '60, and now they roll,<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7106-00000025"/> uncheckd, frum Calyforny 2 Mane. One island is yet unsquelched. Noo Jersey yet is troo to Dimocrisy-a oasis amid the steril desert, a green spot by the wayside, a beekon lite to the ship-reckd maryner, a whisky-jug in Mane-thank hevin fer Noo Jersey-halleloogy! I am prowd 2 say that I, yoor paster, wuz born in Noo Jersey-that my father sawd wood fer the Presydent uv the Camden and Amboy, and my mother wuz his watherwoman. Umble wuz our lot, but wat sez the good book-"It is better to be a dorekeeper at the house uv Dimocrasy, than a postmaster in the tents uv Abolishnism. But 2 resoom:</p> 
               <p>Wat shel we do to be saivd? This inquiry is uv pekoolyer intrest jest now. Let we ask why do we need savin? Dimocrisy is the pure refind salt uv the government-to speek uv salt savin is a abserdity. Ah! my frends, wile Dimocrisy savd the Guverment, the Guverment savd Dimocrisy. It wuz a strikin illustrashen uv the eternel fitnes uv things. So long ez my venrable frend hed a Post Orifis he wood be wus nor a loonatik ef he did not sustane the Guverment that giv him the Post Orifis. Evrything went on, so long ez we hed the Post Orifises. Wat we want jest now is votes-and how to get em is the question. Whisky used to do it! but alas! the amount uv whisky nessary to convert a Abolishnist to Dimocrisy, wood kill him afore be cood vote-they not being seasond vessels.</p> 
               <p>We lost controle, my brethren, by bein stubbern. O! let us dodge toat fatal errer. The last elecshen shode that we cood not lede the people-let the peeple lede us. Ef the peeple want war, let us be war men; ef they want peece, let us sing hosanners to peece! Ef they want war in Ohio, let Ohio Dimicrats be war, and if Noo York wants peece, let em be peece men. Our platform is broad enuff to acommodait all, and on the mane question, which is Post Orifis, we kin all agree, halleloogy!</p> 
               <p>Hevin settled the matter uv faith, we will considder that uv work, fer faith without works is uv no moar use than a whisky punch without the whisky. Ther must be no draft-the men must be razed by volunteerin. Exstrordinory indoosements must be held out fer Abolishnists to enlist-fer evry wun who goes stands a lively chance uv trubblin us no moar. We must hev our voters back frum Canady. My frends ther were enuff good Dimocrats in Canady to hev savd Ohio and Noo York. They must be hum, to wunst. We need em.</p> 
               <p>We hev not suffishently improvd the nigger-we neglectid him. Ther is 2 sides to the war question, but on nigger we air invulnerable. Why yu ask! Becoz he has no frends. The Abolishnists air afeerd to defend him, and by taking uv him to them we hev wun menny a fite. O bless the Lord fer the nigger, he is our tower uv strength.</p> 
               <p>My brethrin, he hev a big job afore us. Let us dally no longer. Think uv the consekences uv another defeet. Sech uv our Dimocratic leeders ez did not git commishns in the army air in a bad shaip. They can't git whisky on tick, furever. Sum uv em hev got so low ez to be obliged to drink dilootid camfene, wich hez a bad effeck upon the stumick. I tride it wunst. They must be releevd. They must hev their posishens and ther regler salaries, fer without em ther stumicks is gone. Brethren, to the breech, to-wunst.</p> 
               <p>My church deppytised me to assertane the wherabouts uv sum Dimocrat who hezn't exprest a opinyun sinse the war commenst, and tender him the nominashen fer the Presidensy.</p>

               <p>I am not apt 2 change. Ez the Samist sez, "wunst I wuz yung, but now I am old," but yung er old, it has alluz bin the saim with me. Whisky strate hez bin my bevridge, and Dimocrisy my tikkit, wun and inseprable, and I hev stuck to em with a fidelity exaled by few and serpast by nun. But the time hez cum fer a raddykel change, in order to saiv the good old party I hev ornamented so long. My reezens are these:</p> 
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7106-00000026"/> 
               <p>The rebelyun is played out. Our Suthern brethrin is gone in. To use figgerativ langidge wich will be understood in the circles in wich I am akustomed 2 move, Linkin has maid 4 alreddy, and holds high, low and jack. So long ez ther wuz any chanse fer the 15 Dimocratic staits to succeed it was natrel fer us to help em, fer then we cood ezy jine with em agin, but ez they are past prayin fer, wat is wisdom fer us? Clerely to help wipe em out. Why? In my skriptooral reedin I wunst found a histry uv a steward who wuz about losin his plais. Like Hamlick he soliloquizd, "Wat kin I do? I can't work, I don't fancy beggin, and hevn't got the green-bax to start a grosery." (Groseries wuz cash in Judee.) A lucky thot emergd frum his Websterian intelleck. "I hev it," sez he to hisself. "I am yet steward. I will giv receets in full to them ez owes my boss, and wen my day uv trubble cums, I'll board with em."</p> 
               <p>The pint is plane. Wile in the serviss uv our Suthrin masters we wuz rayther hard on our Afrikin brethrin. We did bete em and choak em, and did despitefully use em. We can't count on the Sutherners no moar-let us elevait the nigger to the plais his master okepide in the party. Like the steward aforesed, let us do good to them we was wunst tuff on, that we may hev frends wen we need em. Let that hory old dotard Tawny be assassynated, and sum wun appinted in his plais, that will reverse his decision that they hedent eny rites that wite men was bound respeck-let Samcox and Fernandy Wood interdoose bills abollyshin slaivry in the staits, and givin evry Afrikan brother a quarter secshun uv land, a 2 hoss teem, a red bunnit with artefishel flowers onto it-maik em sittyzens, and then-</p> 
               <p>We'd get evry wun uv em. This wood give us the fifteen Suthrin staits as in the happy daze of yoar, and the 500,000 uv our cullerd brethrin, now in Kanady, cood be brot back to the land uv their nativity, and distribbited thro Ohio and Noo York, so ez to redeem them staits frum the rule uv misgided Abolish-I meantersay, Republikins. This plan is feezible, and pekoolierly adapted to the Dimecratic mind, wich is flexyble, very. Let it be adoptid and wunst moar will the good ole party repose under the shadder uv the Trezury bildins, wunst agin will the chozn few dror regler salaris, and the Nashen flurish under the blessing we lost wen Bookannon, the gileless, retird to privit life.</p>

               <p>Yisterdy I heerd a Abolishnist remark, "The world moves." The observashen (wich I hev heerd frequently uv lait) set me into a trane uv refleckshen. My comperhensive mind sprang back into the misty daze uv the past, and I wuz a boy agin. Twenty-six yeres ago I wuz a splittin my symetrikle throte a hollerin fer Van Booren. Them wuz the pammy daze uv Dimocrisy. Androo Jaxon hed left us his naim ez cappytal fer us to do biznis on, wile he wuz out uv the way, and coodent interfere with our steelin, wich wuz comfortable. We wus beetn, but wuz still strong and viggerous, knowin that we cood manaje to live doorin Harryson's rane on wat we hed stole doorin Van Booren's, the fasilites havin bin unlimitid. O them times! Ther wuz Cass and Davis, and Dickison, and Calhoon, and Tooms, and Bill Allen, and Duglis, (who wuz jest comin in.) and Ritchy, and Benton, and Isaer Rynders, and Wise, and Yankee Sullivan, a gelloreous galexy uv intellectooal and muskeler Dimocrisy, sech ez the world never seed afore and never will agin. Wuz Abolishnism tolratid in them happy daze! Not enny. O with what arder Oin Luvjoy wuz shot at Alton-how wiggerusly the Dimocrisy laberd to throw his press in2 the turbid waters uv the Missisipi. Wood, o wood that we cood hev sunk his doctrins with his press. Did we allow Abolishn talk? Nary. These stalwart arm hev hurled baskit-fuls uv unsavry eggs at the pedlers uv polittikle heresy, and my skill in eggin Abolishn lecterers wunst maid we Justis uv the peese in my nativ township.</p> 
               <p>In the South every hillside wuz dottid with the carcasses uv Noo Ingland skootmarms, who hevin bin suspected uv teechin niggers to<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7106-00000027"/> rede, wuz justly hung, and the plesent crack uv the whip wuz heerd all over the land. Oh them Arcadian dase, wen it only took 20 minits to arrest, try, sentence, hang and divide the close uv a Yankee skoolteecher!</p> 
               <p>But alas! heresees crep in2 our ranks, and ther wuz confooshun. Van Booren bolted and bete Cass, and notwithstandin he repentid, afterward, the Abolishon pizon he interdoost in2 the Dimocratic body pollytik, remaned. It broke out in ugly sores in Ohio, in 1848, in the shaip uv the feendish Free sile party. Then Chaise and Brinkerhoof sluffed orf, and jind with our ainshent enemis. Jest afterward the Anti-Nebrasky excitement, cuppled with No-Nothinism, whaled us, and it wuz only by sooperhooman eggsershens that we electid Bookannon. Sense it hez bin nothin but disaster. Bookannon and Duglis got by the eers, Duglis refoosed to cave to his suthrin brethrin, Linkin wuz electid, war ensood, and now wat do these old ize behold? Cass, and Ben Butler, and Logan, and Dix, and Dickison, and Dave Tod, strikin hands with Josh Griddins, and Horris Greely! It is a singeler fact, that every leader we used to trust is now agin us. And wuss. Abolishn papers is bein publisht in South Karliny, in Tennisee, Kentucky and Loozeaner, and a millyun uv men, led by the ghosts and ghostesses uv them hung skoolmasters and skoolmarms aforesaid, assisted by John Brown's soul, wich is littrally a marchin on, is enforcin a proclamashen freein all the niggers at wun stroak, and the Dimocrisy bein sum hundreds uv thowsends in the minority, is powerless to prevent it.</p> 
               <p>Trooly, the world moves. It hez moved the Dimocrisy from the Pedestal uv Power it wunst okepide, and laid it prostrait. It hez elevatid men we despised, and adoptid idees we scoft at. Yunger men may shift and git in2 the tide agin, but ez fer me I cant. I shel maik wun moar effort, and if we fail-why then I shel withdraw from public life, and start a grosery, and in that umble callin will flote peecefully down the streem uv time, until my wether beten bark strikes on the rox of deth, gittin my likker in the menetime, (uv wich I consume menny,) at wholesail prices.</p>

               <p>I hev bin for menny yeres disposed to bleeve in speritooalism. Ther is suthin plesent in the idee uv bein in communicashen with them ez hev gone before, as it may be reznable supozed that frum their stan-pint they kin see things in a more clearer lite than we who is encumbered with clay. Akordingly I invited a distingisht mejum to visit my flock. * * * * * * *</p> 
               <p>A circle wuz formd, and I wuz requestid to call fer the sperit uv sum wun. Hevin a few Abolishnists present, whom I wisht to enliten on politikle topix, I cald for Tomus Jefferson. "Tomus," sez I, "wuz yoo the father uv Dimocrasy?"</p> 
               <p>(I use my own langige, ez them old fellers wuz not alluz elegant.)</p> 
               <p>"I wuz."</p> 
               <p>"Tomus, are the party now barin the name yoor child?"</p> 
               <p>"Not any. Its a mizable bastard, born uv John C. Calhoon, and that old hag, Stait Rites, and a low-lived whelp it is. My heirs is them ez supports the Guverment I help to maik."</p> 
               <p>"But, Tomus, wood yoo hev us support a Abolishn war fer the perpus uv freein niggers?"</p> 
               <p>The sperit rapt out with awful distinknis, "We hold these trooths to be self-evident that awl men is creatid ekal, and endoud with certing inaleyenable rites, among wich is life, liberty-"</p> 
               <p>At this pint I stopt the mejum. I knew the sperit wuz not Tomus Jefferson, but a imposter, hevin heerd a Abolishn preecher use the same langige at a 4th uv Guly selebrashen. I then cald Androo Jaxon, hoo respondid.</p> 
               <p>"Androo," sez I, "woodent yoo like to be back on yearth, jist now?"</p> 
               <p>"Yoo kin bet I wood," retortid he. "I'd like to hev bin President in the plais uv that old, white-liverd, black-cockade Fedralist, Bookannon. Wat a hangin ther wood hev bin! Ther wood hev bin<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7106-00000028"/> vacansis in Congris, and jest ez menny funerals ez ther wuz vacansis. As for Sowth Carliny,"-</p> 
               <p>The communycashen ceesd, and I heard a sound like the grittin uv teeth. It resoomed. "I'd string up Valandigum, and Fernandy Wood, and Sam Medary, et settry. It wood be a bad old joke on them indivijjles ef I hed controle of the habis corpus, I'd-"</p> 
               <p>I refoozed to here ferther. This spent wuz also ondoutdly a imposter.</p> 
               <p>I cald fer Benton, who merely sed that Miasory wuz comm to her sensis in gittin rid uv slaivry, and fer Duglis who remarkt that he cood say uv the temple of Dimocrisy ez the Savior sed of the sinagog, "My howse is cald a howse of prayr, but ye hev maid it a den of theeves," both of whom wuz onquestionably imposters. Another sperit (probably of a deceest abolishnist,) sed that Benedict Arnold and Judis Iscariot hadent bin on speekin terms fer sum time, Iscariot hevin called Arnold a copperhed. Arnold sed he'd never stand that.</p> 
               <p>Duglis cum back, and sed he had jest wun word 2 say. The Dimocratic party wuz wunst grate, but it hed got in2 bad hands and gon crazy as a drunken bed-bug. It needid new manajers-men uv suffishent sence and honisty to run the party on old prinsipples. In the old hands it wuz a pattryotic party-a party that wuz alluz for the country. It whaled the British in 1812, and afterwards nockt the hind sites off uv the old Fedral party fer opposin it. It smasht Mexico, and afterwards smasht the Whig party fer not helpin. Now for the Dimocrisy to oppose a war agin rebels who not only commenst it, but hed actooally bustid the party itself, is loonacy unekaled in the histry uv the world. Squelch them tuppenny pollytishns who hev heeved the mantels wunst worn by Jaxon and Benton (they look in em jest about as well as a orgin grinders munky wood in a soljer's overkote, and fill em jest as much), get onto a war platform, and"- I didn't care about persooin my investigashens enny ferther, pertikelerly ez the Abolishnists were all a enickrin. Its my privit opinyun that thers nothin relyable about it. Hed the sperits bin reely them uv Jefferson, Jaxon, and sich, they woodent hev talkt so much undilootid niggerism.</p> 
                
               <p>However, it did me very well. The mejum took up a colleckshun uv six dolers, wich, by a singler coincidence, was the eggact amount I hed intendid to charge him fer the use uv my church. He grumbeld, but finelly sheld out. I am now warin a new pare uv pants.</p>

               <p>Mankind is the most perverse and onrezonable beins uv the human family. Wile they assent 2 a principple, they never will put it into practis ef it bares hard onto em ez indivijjles, to-wit:</p> 
               <p>I had bin for sevral weeks deliverin a coarse uv lekters on the divinnity uv slaivry. I argood that the institooshn wuz based upon the infeeriority uv wun man 2 another-that it wuz not only a wise but a bootiful pervision uv nacher that the strong shood hev charge uv the week, a guidin, and protektin and a workin uv em. The idee plezed my congregashen vastly, and fifteen or twenty uv the strongest perposed that it shood be put into praktis, jest 2 show the world that the grate doctrine cood be carried out jest as well in the North as in the South. To wich I assented to-wunst, and at the next biznis meetin, the follerin plan wuz adoptid: The members uv the congregashen shood try ther strength, and them as cood lift 600 shood own and possess, in fee simple, all them ez coodent.</p> 
               <p>The trial wuz hed, the divizshen maid, and I wuz happy at beir the umble instrooment uv plantin the grate institooshen on Northrin sile.</p> 
               <p>But alas, owin 2 the perversity uv the human mind, aforesaid, it dident work. Old John Podhammer razed his 600 with the gratest eeze, wile Bill Sniffles, who wuz a workin fer him fer 12 dolers a munth coodent fetch it. Podhammer went over to Bill's cabin, the next mornin, and sez he, "Wilyum, frum this time hentz4th, and<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7106-00000029"/> furever yoo air my man. As all a slaiv has is his masters, the 18 dolers I owe yoo, or that I did owe yoo afore this blessid system wuz establisht, I shel kepe, and as yoo hev moar furnytoor than befits yoor lowly condishen, I will send a teem over to-morrer, and taik yer bewrow and stand, and bedstids up to my house, and-"</p> 
               <p>At this junctur in cums Mrs. Sniffles, who kin lift 600 with old Podhammer on the top uv it, and it wuz no time afore she diskivered wat his biznis wuz. She turnd red in the fais. Sed she:</p> 
               <p>"Yoor goin to take my furnytoor?"</p> 
               <p>"Certingly."</p> 
               <p>"And we air yoor slaivs?"</p> 
               <p>"Uv coarse."</p> 
               <p>"And yoo kin sell my children?"</p> 
               <p>"Naterally."</p> 
               <p>"And yoo kin maik me yoor conkebine?"</p> 
               <p>"Ef I wish?"</p> 
               <p>"Yoo old beest!" shreckt the infooriated femail chattel, forgettin her normal condishn, "yoo sell my babies, yoo taik my furnytoor, drat ye, I'll giv ye sum uv it now," whereupon she hurled a chare, wich laid him prostrait on the flore, wen she pickt him up and flung him out the dore.</p> 
               <p>It did not end here: Podhammer hed in his hand a patch-work coverlid, wich he thot he wood taik with him, and wen he cum to he walked off with it, whereupon Mrs. Sniffles hed him took up on a charge uv steelin, and he wuz actooaly tride, found gilty, and sent to jail fer 30 daze. How kin we establish Dimocratic institooshens, wen the corts won't recognize the laws of nacher. The experiment, for the present, hez the apperentz of a failyer.</p>

               <p>Trouble air a cumin upon me thicker and faster. "Men change, but principples, never," hez bin a motto uv mine fer yeers, and bleevin in the grate principple of the strong owning the week, or in uther words, Slaivry, I shel never ceese my efforts to maik it universal. Ther bein a onreesonable prejudis in the minds uv the week uv my congregashen aginst bein the perpetooal servance uv them as nacher hez maid to rool, I called a special meetin of my flock, to considder the matter. I interdoost the matter thus:</p> 
               <p>By Hager I provd that slaivry was scriptooral.</p> 
               <p>By "cussid be Kanan," et settry, I shode concloosively that the nigger wuz the indentikle indivijjle who wuz to be the sed slaiv aforesed.</p> 
               <p>Then it wuz put to vote and it wuz unanimusly resolvd that Aferken slaivry be interdoost amongst us. I notist with pleasure that the poorer the indivijjle, the moar anxshus he seemd to own a nigger.</p> 
               <p>Opinyuns wer then interchanged. Absolum Kitt, who is a carpenter, and who never saved a doler, hevin alluz hed a sick wife and a large family of childern, sed he felt that a grate work hed bin dun that nite. The prowd Anglo-saxun whom nacher intendid to <unclear>rool</unclear>, heb bin that nite elewatid 2 his normel speer. Hentz4th ther wuz no moar labor fer him. He hed a contrak to bild a howse for brother Podhammer, and he hed no doubt that the brethrin who wuz bles with menes wood make up a puss, and enable him 2 buy a nigger carpenter to do his work.</p> 
               <p>Brother Podhammer aroz. He, uv coarse, wood be glad to assist brother Kitt, but dooty 2 his family reqwired a diffrent line uv askashen. His idee wuz to purchis a nigger carpenter hisself, and</p> 
               <p>"WHAT!" exclaimd Kitt.</p> 
               <p>Brother Podhammer resoomd. He intended to buy a nigger carpenter hisself, and bild his house. The cheef buty uv the grate sys-<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7106-00000030"/> tem, and the wun that maiks it altogether luvly, is that yoo kin BUY yoor labor.</p> 
               <p>"But," sed Kitt, "what kin I do if yoo work nigger carpenters?"</p> 
               <p>"Trooly," sez Podhammer, "I kno not. A carpenter kin be purchist fer $1,000, the interest uv wich is $60, and his keepin say $100 more, per annum. Now ef brother Kitt'll cum to them wagis, and be modritly unable, I mite, fer his saik, forego the exquisit pleasure uv hevin a nigger to flog, and still employ him."</p> 
               <p>"But," sez Kitt, turnin pail, "my family wood starve on them wagis. Wy, I mite ez well be a nigger myself."</p> 
               <p>At this pint I lifted up my voise. I exorted Bro. Kitt to patience. The grate Dimocratic idee that cappytal shood own labor must be establisht. It may bare hard upon indivijjles, but wat then? John Rogers went camly to the stake fer principple. Ef Bro. Kitt doth not like to accept his normel condishon to-wunst, he kin go to sum less favored country, wher the grate instooshon is not establisht.</p> 
               <p>Bro. Podger, a blacksmith, sed he suppozd the rich uns wood buy a nigger blacksmith, and let him emigrait.</p> 
               <p>Bro. Snipes, a plastrer, maid a simler obserwashen.</p> 
               <p>Bro. Punt, a bricklayer, remarkt likewise.</p> 
               <p>Whereupon, they all, in corus, similerly exclaimed they see us d-d fust, and then they woodent.</p> 
               <p>Whereupon they reconsidered the resolushen establishin slaivry.</p> 
               <p>Kitt and his herritix wuz not at church last Sundy, and the Postmaster told me that they hed sent orf a club fer the Noo York Triboon.</p>

               <p>My brethren and sisteren: I shall maik sum remarks this mornin based upon the bootiful parable of the prodygal sun. I wood reed 2 yoo the passij, but the Bible I hev is the only wun in the township, and I lent it yisterdy 2 Square Gavitt, who sed swarin witnesses on almanacs woodent do in hoss casses, and he hasent brung it back. The skripter sez, in substance:</p> 
               <p>Ther was a certin man who hed 2 suns. The yungist hed a taist fer that branch uv agricultooral persoots known ez sowin wild oats, so he askt the old man fer his sheer uv the estait. He got it, turnd it into greenbax, and went off. He commenst livin high-bording at big hotels, and keepin trottin hosses, and playin bilyards, and sich. In about a year he run thro his pile, and wuz ded broak. Then his credit playd out, and he wuz in a tite place for his daily bred. The idee struck him that he hed better put for hum, wich he did. The old man saw him a cumin, and he run out and met him, and giv him a new cote, and a order for a pare uv shoes, and kild a fat caff, and hed flour doins. The oldest boy obgected 2 these sayin, "Lo I hav servd thee these menny yeres, and thou never madest no splurge over me, but when this thy son, who hez fooled away his pile, returns you kill calves and sich." Then the old man retorts sayin, "My sun who wuz lost is found, the sheep who went astray is cum back, let us be merry."</p> 
               <p>My brethren, this parable applize ez well to the present time ez though it wuz maid fer it. Uncle Samyuel is the old man, the suthem wing uv the Dimocratic party is the proddygal, and the Abolishnists is the oldest sun. The south got tired and went off on its own hook. It haz, I maik no doubt, spent the heft uv its substance, and will shortly conclude to cum home. Now the grate question uv the hour is how shel he be reseeved. My frends, the Dimocratic rool is to foller the scripter wen yoo can maik a pint by so doin. In this pertikeler case Godlinis is gane, halleloogy, therefour, let us be Godly. Let Uncle Samyooel see the repentant proddygal afar orf-let him go out to seek him, er send Fernandy Wood, and when he hez found him let him fall, not upon his neck, but at his feet-let him put onto him the perple robe wich is royalty, and upon his hand a ring, wich is dominion, wich is a improvement upon scripter.</p> 
               <p>But the Abolishnist, who is the elder sun, steps up and sez, "Nary.<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7106-00000031"/> He wuz a doin well and he wented out frum us, takin awl that wuz his own, and sech ez he cood steel, all uv wich he hez spent upon such harlots as Afrikin slaivry, Stait rites, and Suthern independence, wich last two menshund is whited sepulkers. I sent my sons Grant, and Rosycrance, and Benbutler after him, but lo! wen he wuz strong and wiggerrus he did despitefully use them. Now that he is week from hunger, let him brindle. Ef we taik him to our buzems, let him cum on his nees, let him cast off the harlots that hav sedoost him, that ther may be no moar trubble in all the land."</p> 
               <p>My brethren, we must taik him back ez the old man did in the bible. Why, do you ask? Becoz he wuz alluz the old man's pet, and had things his own way. We wuz his frends and shared with him the steelins, but sence he went out the Abolishn brother and his frends hev controld things and whare air we? Eko ansers no whair! We okepy low plasis in the sinagog, and the doggery keepers go mournin about the streets and refuse to be comforted becoz ther cash is not plenty, and ef we taik back the proddygal shorn of his strength, of what avail is he to us? He must cum back ez strong as ever, he must bring his harlots with him-he must ROOL! Then shel we hev the Post Orifises, and then shel we agin live on the fat uv the land, dodgin the cuss uv labor. Brethrin, let us be dillygent in this grate work, instant in seeson and out of seeson.</p> 
               <p>A collecshun wuz takin up fer the perpus uv sending a mishunary 2 Massychusits, wich yeelded 7 dolers. Ez the amount woodent pay the ralerode fair, it wuz voted to apply it on repairs on the church, wich I did by havin my boots haff-sold and buyin a new hankercher.</p>

               <p>Last Saterdy nite I hed a dreme. I hed bin a redin "Cotton is King," and sech works, aidin my understandin with frequent drafts frum a bottel containin "nacher's last, best gift 2 man," and I fell in2 a gentel slumber. I dreemd that the Confederasy hed bin successful, that it carrid out its orijinel idee, and hed subjoogatid the northern staits. Gefferson Davis wuz roolin at Washinton under the title uv "Gefferson I, Empror uv all the Amerikys." The Senit and Hows uv Repsentativs hed bin dun away with by decrees, and the biznis uv governin wuz dun solely by the Empror and his ministers. All to wunst I wuz in Washinton, a rolein along in a gorjus carige. I wuz sumwat surprizd at my persnel apperans. I wuz drest in flesh culered tites, with sandels on my feet, with dimund buckels onto em, and on my hed wuz a crown, makin me resemble a play acter I seed wunst a playin Richerd. Suddenly the carige stopt, and I alitid, and assended the steps uv the Palise. It wuz a resepshun, and a chamberlin wuz announcin the gests ez they arriv. "Earl von Seymor!" "Count de Sammedary!" "Markuis Fernandywood!" and ez I stept forerd wat a gush uv exstasy thrild thro my vanes as the chamberlin (who wuz little Samcox,) showtid, "DOOK DE NASBY!" O wat a moment!</p> 
               <p>My dreems continnerd. Methawt the nobility wuz maid up uv the offisers uv the Confedrit armies, and sech Northern men ez hed bin troo to the Confedrisy. The Northern staits hed bin diwided into dookdums, and erldums and sich-my territory extending forty miles eech way frum Wingert's Corners, whair my dookal palise wuz sitooated. Niggers wuz dun away with, ez all the whites excepting the privligd classes wuz serfs, wich effectooally settled the question uv Afrikin slaivry. The nobility ownd the land and the inhabitants wuz all pesantry, payin to the lord uv the soil, 4-fifths uv the produx. I wuz livin in stile. We hed subjoogatid the Abolishnists, and wuz usin their leadin men ez our meenyels. 0, it wuz magnificent and<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7106-00000032"/> gorjus. I arose evry mornin with Sumner a holdin a bason, and Waid a pourin uv perfoomd water over my hands, after wich Gim Ashly dryd em with towels. They wuz my servance! Poetikle justise.</p> 
               <p>In short, Gefferson Davis, ez soon as he hed the power, hed declaird the idee uv men governin themselves a failyoor, and hed revivd the old foodel system. France and England hed assisted him in establishn hisself, and hed jest got the thing into good runnin order. One seen in my dreem filled me full uv joy. I thot I wuz in my dukel robes in my ancestrel halls, overlookin my stewart, (editer Raymond, uv Noo York Times,) a reseevin triboot frum the happy pesantry, wen I notist among em sum who hed refoosed me credit in the days uv the Republic. Rage filld my sole. "Away with the hory miscreance," showtid I to my armd serviters, "away with em 2 the deepest dunjun neeth the castel mote! ha! ha!" Just then I awoke</p> 
               <p>It wuz but a dreem, but it left an impreshen on my mind. "If we succeed in smashin Lincoln and his guverment," thawt I, "a monerkey must ensoo, and, who nose, I may yet be Dook de Nasby!" Filled with new zele I resoomd laber on my sermon for the morrer, on the unconstooshnality uv the puttin down rebelyuns with muskets, with renood wigger.</p>

               <p>Halleloogy!</p> 
               <p>Now is the winter uv our diskontent, maid gellorious summer. The clowds that oercast the perlitticle horyzon is broak, and rays frum the sun uv success hev peerced em, gildin the nosis uv the fatheful with a rayjence that whisky can not give.</p> 
               <p>Honey hez cum out uv a karkis-good hez perceeded frum Nazzyreth. The Raddykels hev nominated Fremont! Halleloogy! They did it at Cleveland.</p> 
                
               <p>I never votid fer Fremont. In '56 I did't like-in fact I aboosed him. I laft at him fer partin his hare in the middle, I accoosed him uv being a Cathlic, and uv steelin cattle frum the Guverment. Wen Linkin appinted him Genral, I aboosed him agin, and more than ever wen he ishood his Emansipashen Proclimashen.</p> 
               <p>But now I diskiver that I hev did him a grevous wrong. The most bekomin way a man kin part his hare is in the middle, the steelin u cattle frum Guverment is a act that no man who supported Bookannon can condem, and his Abolishnism-why hez to be pitied for that.</p> 
               <p>Uv coarse no Dimocrat can vote for him, for ther is a triflin diffrence in our prinsipples, yet about a haff uv the Abolishn party ought to do it by all menes. John C. is the man fer them ondoubtedly.</p> 
               <p>But wether he gits menny votes er few, his bein nominated is salvashen to us. Every vote he gits, Linkin won't git, and then what-</p> 
               <p>The bair thot almost overpowers me. We kin elect a Dimocrat!</p> 
               <p>This movement put a new face upon affairs. We needn't be pertikelerly anxshus enny moar fer Lee's success-in fact, I bleeve it wood be better fer us 2 hev Grant whip Lee and taik Richmond. Fer why? Becoz. Spozn about the time the Confederasy is playd out we elect a Dimocrat, and spozn that Dimocrat lets up on em, restoars ther niggers, pardones em, pays ther debts, compensaits them ez hez sustaned losses in the war, and penshens ther widders, woodent they let us hev the heft uv the orfisis a while. Uv coarse they wood.</p> 
               <p>I segest that the Committis who air takin up collecshuns fer Vallandygum, send the munny forthwith to Fremont's Execootiv Committy. I shel talk up a collecshun in my congregashen immediately fer that purpus.</p>
