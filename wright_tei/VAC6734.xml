We don't mind telling the reader, very confiden- tially, that this is not by any means, our first effort at a preface for this work: and we earn- estly hope that the public will not pronounce this ninth one so stupid as we deemed the eight preceding ones that we tore up. It will be perceived that our hero bears the historic name of JoHN SMITH. Original old JOHN  SMITH the Virginia settler, met with many adventures-some of them   funny and others not so funny-among the latter was the affair with Miss Pocahontas and her stern old parent: and we claim, for our own JOHN SMITH, as many adventures as his illustrious namesake-some of them quite as funny and others funnier.    <pb n="8-9 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC6734-00000006"/> 8         PREFACE. Nothing in this narrative of real incidents is at all calculated to reflect on the excellent character of Mr. Smith: and this is because we esteem him very highly and not from any dread of the law; for John Smith is so multitudinous, that one could handle the name with impunity, and not incur any risk of prosecution for libel. What would a court say to an action against a writer for libeling JOHN SMITH, yeoman!-espe- cially when the writer should plead that he never meant that JOHN SMITH, but quite another, unknown to the court. There are those who will shrewdly guess that the hero of the narrative represents the author himself, the chief grounds for such inference being a striking similarity in the number of nether limbs. That, however, should scarcely be taken as conclusive; for, since " this cruel war is over," there are nearly as many one- legged men in the country as there are JOHN SMITHS!

Not that it was the only one fired, for they were rattling away at the rate of a thousand per second just then; but there was one rifle in par- ticular discharged, which, so far as I was concerned, was clearly distinguishable from all the rest. I did not see it, nor am I confident that, in the din of battle, I heard its report; yet I was made painfully aware of its existence and proximity, and shall no doubt entertain a recollection of it while life lasts, and reason retains her throne. That rifle, evidently fired by some one whom I would have shot first, if I had had a good chance- and therefo e I couldn't blame him much for shooting me-threw a leaden ball of one ounce in weight, and (13)    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6734-00000009"/> "    JOHN SAIT-I ON A CRUTCH. similar to an acorn in shape; and that missile, travel- ling at the rate of five thousand miles an hour-though they rarely travel a whole hour without resting-- struck and wounded me, John Smith. It passed thirough the thigh, lacerating that muscle vulgarly known as the tensor vaginga femoris, and 'causing a compound fracture of the femur, barely below the troctianlter major; that is to say, it broke the bone about three inches below the hip. The ball had come diagonally from the direction of my right and front, passing through the outside portion of the left thigh, and coming out only an inch and a half from where it had entered; and I could not help, when I had regained my composure, making some little geometric calculations on the sub- ject. I reckoned that if the man who had fired the rifle-allowing him to have been one hundred yards distant, and the barrel of the piece to have been four feet long--had moved the muzzle the one-hundredth part of an inch to the right, I should have been missed; if he had elevated it about the same distance I should have been missing. My next thought was that whereas my antagonist had discharged his rifle, I must request the government to discharge me. Some of my  comrades carried me from the field and, after a little diversion in the way of fainting, got me loaded into a one-horse ambulance-a vehicle that can beat a wild-cat jumping on moderately rough ground-and away it went, plunging diagonally across a corn-field, like a schooner hove to in a storm. A shattered limb is one of the most painful things in the world, especially when its owner is jostled about like   THE WAY IT HAPPENED.      15 old rusty nails. For good, solid, substantial pain, I know of nothing worthy of being spoken of on the sane day with it. The toothache, in its worst form, is bliss clompared with it. There was another wrounded " hero " in the ambu- lance, lying beside me; his leg was shattered below ' the knee; and I reckon that the yelling he and I did, jointly, wasn't the sort to be excelled by any other two youths of medium abilities. We were driven to a small log schoolhouse that was used, as a surgical hospital, and there unloaded. I do not know what became of my companion in - misery--that is, in the ambulance-for it was as much as I could do to keep myself in view for some days following. Within the schoolhouse were several surgeons busily engaged in amputating liimbs; while without, beneath some oak trees that stood near, lay a great m^ any sufferers awaiting their turn. I must give the surgeons credit for considerable dispatch-and no doubt they dispatched many a poor fellow that day- for I observed that every few minutes, a whole man, (in a bad state of repair, to be sure,) was carried in, and soon after carried out, in from two to four -pieces. They did their work up with rapidity, and by even- ing, the arms and legs that were piled up against the wall of the schoolhouse without, would have amounted to a full cord-limb measure.  Well, as I do not intend to dwell on this part of the narrative very long, I will simply say that the doctors finally reached my case. I was carried into the little building, where so many pangs had been    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6734-00000010"/> 16     JOHN SMNITH ORN A CERUTCH. suffered that day, and laid on an operatingr-table; and after a slight examination of my wound, and a con- sultation of eight or nine seconds, they lulled me to repose with chloroform, and scienti]'cally relieved me of mny left leg. When I returned from the state of profound oblivion into which the chloroform had thrown me, I was glad to find that they had not made a mistake, and cut off the wrong limb-as a doctor was once known to do. They had amputated the 'I/gfht leg, because the left one was the righIt one-it being the wounded one-and my riyht leg was now my lefyt one, because it was the only one left. Yet, the other was always the left one, and it has remained so, because it has been ever since left on the battle ground. However, that is all right. What I suffered during the ensuing three months in Smoketown Hospital, several miles from Sharps- burg, I will pass over with but a thought and a shudder, and hasten on to. tell of the curious and amusing adventures I have since met with, "on a crutch." I will never forget my first attempt to walk on crutches. I thought it looked easy, to see others walking about the hospital on crutches; just as an in- experienced person is apt to think rowing a boat an easy matter, because he sees others do it with appa- rent facility. So, one day, when my strength had so increased that I thought I could bear my weight on my only leg, I urged the nurse to lift me up and let me try a pair of crutches. He did so. He raised me up, and I stood holding tremulously to the tent-post-for I and five other un-   THE WAY IT HAPPENED.       17 fortunates occupied a hospital tent-while he care fully placed a crutch under each of my arms. It was the first time for several months that I had been in an erect position, and you can't well imagine how I felt---without studying a good while about it. The ground on which I stood seemed so far beneath that it made me quite dizzy to look down on it, and I trembled at the awful possibility of falling. With the crutches under my arms, and the nurse's strong hand on my shoulder to keep ime steady, I made two or three feeble, -timid strides, and conclud- ing that walking on crutches was not quite what it was " cracked up " to be, I faintly said: "Nurse, put me down on the bed again: I fear I will never walk well on a crutch." "Pshaw!" said he, as he assisted me to return to my couch of straw; "you do well, and you'll do twice as well next time you try it." "Twice as well would be but poorly," I rejoined. "However, I will do my best." "Certainly! Don't- think of getting discouraged." As I now look back on that dismal scene, and re- member the sinking heart that throbbed so feebly within me, and the wasted trembling limbs with which I attempted to flee from my prison-like bed, I cannot help smiling;-now, when I can skate as fast as any one, on my solitary foot, swim as well as I ever could, climb like a squirrel, jump on a saddled horse and ride at any pace I please, place a hand on a fence as high as my head and spring over in a quarter of a second, or walk twenty-five or thirty miles a day-all this with one good leg, a crutch and a cane! ;-,    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6734-00000011"/> 18     JOhN SAMTHl 0N A CLUTCIt. When the spring came, and I could walk about with some ease, I went from my country home to Philadelphia, to get one of Palmer's artificial legs, supposiig that I could wear one advantageously. While on the subject, I will simply say that I got one, but never used it much, because there was too little of the thighll left to attach it to firmlly. Not that I would be understood to detract frolm the repu- tation of Palmer's patent li mb; for we all liked tle Doctor, and were most favorably imprtssed with his handiwork; and my subsequent observations have left no doubt in my mind that his are the most nearly pelife :t of any artificial limbs manufactured. Matjor King, Assistant Surgeon-General of Phila- delphia, sent me to Haddington IIospital, to wait till the proposed new limb should be ready for me; and it was there that I, JOHN SIITH, fairly began my somiewhlat eventful career-"' ON A CRUTCH." The hospital, located near the beautiful suburban villtge of Haddington, was set apart for such" heroes," as had lost arms or legs, and desired to replace them with substantial wooden ones. It was not unusual at fllitt timle to see fifty or sixty one-legged menn stroll- in thloutt the grounds, in fine weather; or squads of fifteen or twenty, supplied with passes for thll day, clambering upon a street car and going into the city for a bit of a spree. A person once asked me if it was not a rather sad sight, and if the boys in this condition were not rather morose and gloomy. The very thought is amusing. I never, anywhere, or under any circum- stance, saw a livelier crowd of fellows than the   THE WAY IT HAPPENED.      19 maimed and crippled soldiers at Haddington Ios- pital! They were nearly all young men, from seven- teen to twenty-two, and a happier, noisier, more frol- icsome set of boys I never saw! It was no unusual thing for some of them, in a merry mood, to carry on till they got t put into the guard-house, by the impa- tient surgeons-sometimes when they scarcely de- served it; but of that, I will say more hereafter.    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6734-00000012"/> 20     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. C HA PTER   II 1. JOHN'S  ADVENTURES WITH A     CRAZY MAN. ,ADDINGTON HOSPITAL had its " characters," as every place has. I formed ties and associa- tions during the spring of my stay there, which can never be forgotten. Nearly all who were there at the time, I remember with pleasure. There was "Chris." Miller, whose leg was amputated below the knee, and who walked splendidly on his "lPalmer leg," when he got it. If there was one of the boys there whom I liked better than anly other, it was "Chris." He was a jovial fellow, humorous and wittfy, and the boys were never at a loss for a laugh when he was about. When he got his artificial leg on tight he got tight himself on the strength of it, and made so much noise that the Doctors came to the melancholy conclusion that it was necessary to put himn into the guard-house-which was Room No. 41, fourth story. There he made more noise than ever, sat in the open window with his feet dangling ouLt- one a wooden one, you know-and threatened to jump down upon the roof of the piazza, a distance of twenty-five or thirty feet; so, the Doctors got scared, lest he should do so, and thus sprain the an:kle of his new leg, alnd they had him brought   JOHN'S ADVENTURES WITH A CRAZY MAN. 21 down and locked up in the cellar, where there was not such a broad field for exercise. Nor shall I ever forget Young, a reckless boy of the New York Fire Zouaves, whose leg was ampu- tated five times. One evening when I was just about to retire, he came home from the city, more than tight, fell, as he came blundering up the steps, and bursted his unfortunate "stump" open, so that half-an-inch more of the bone hade to be sawed off. He begged the privilege of keeping this fragment of himself, and when he got into a convalescent state again, he worked whole days at it with a pocket knife, and carved it into a very handsome ring, which he ever afterwards wore on his middle finger, both at the table and elsewhere. There, too, was, Mr. Becker, (a citizen,) the clerk of the hospital. He was a handsome fellow, with black curling hair; and he made love, pro temjpore, to one of the village girls. And there was Bingham, whom I shall never forget, a religious fellow who sung psalms of an evening, and induced the boys to make up money enough for him to go 'home on-athough it was sub- sequently ascertained that he had plenty of money himself at the time. He was the only mean fellow I remember; but he had lost a leg in the service of his country, and I will spare him. One evening, a few weeks after I had been ad- mitted to the hospital, a man named Thomas, who had been absent for ten days, returned and occupied :;   a bed by the side of mine. He was a soldier who had been slightly wounded, and was doing guard t -   l 1t. -i  '    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6734-00000013"/> 22     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCII. duty at the hospital. He had been absent witlhout leave, had been drinling all that time, and now re- turned in a very nervous and shattered state of body, and an uneasy and gloomy frame of mind. To add to his trepidation, he was apprehensive that he had been marked as a deserter, during his absence; and he retired to bed in uncommonly low spirits. I was just falling asleep, and every thinog was quiet about the hospital, when Mr. Thomas suddenly star- tled me by spraiging up to a sitting posture in his bed, and crying out: "No you don't! I'll die first! I won't be taken! You want to try me for a deserter and shoot me with twelve muskets! I tell you, I'll not be taken!" " rYhat's the matter, Thomas?"I asked in alarm. " Matter? Why, don't you see? There's a whole company of soldiers surrounding the house, and they want to take me for a deserter! Look!'" he exclaimed wildly, pointing through the window. "Don't you see them?" "No. no," I replied, perceiving that he was afflicted with a mild attack of the horrors. "uThere are no soldiers there. Lie down!" * "Yes, there are!" he exclaimed, springing out upon the floor. "See! See! Twenty! Thirty! Forty! Fifty!-I'll cut their hearts out if they try to take me! I will!"    Here he swore a profane oath. I confess that I felt rather uneasy in the presence of this madman, but calming my fears, I said, coax- ingly : "' Come, now, Thomas, there's no one after you. Don't act so foolishly 1 Do lie down and go to sleep!'9   JOHN'S ADVENTURES WITH A CRAZY MAN. 23 "But I see them! They are down there by that car, now. Do you see? .i O, I'm watching them! They'll be sharp if they take me alive!" The terminus of the Market Street and W est Philadelphia horse railway is at the building then u sed as a hospital, and a car arrived and departed every forty minutes till eleven o'clock. At this time, there was one standing some fifty yards from the building, awaiting its time to depart for the depot in West Philadelphia. "Yes, I do see them now,' I said, thinking it better to humor him; " but it is very plain they have con- cluded you are not here, for they are getting on that car to leave." "O, I know their tricks 1" he replied, quickly. "Theyonly want to make me think they are gone, so that I will go to sleep, and they can come and take me easily. But they don't catch me that way! I should think not!"Ha! Ha! Hia!" "Really, Thomas," said I, persuasively, "I believe they intend to go. Go to bed, and I will watch for you. If they do not leave on that car when it goes, -and offer to come this way, I will wake you and tell you. Depend on me." uWill you?" "Yes, indeed I will. Lie down." "I will, then; but, mind, don't let 'em get near. They're sly as foxes. Watch 'em." "Don't fear," I replied. "Go to bed, and I will wake you in good time if I see them coming." Thereupon Thomas, who was a large strong manr ;:  . of thirty years, returned somewhat reluctantly to his A-i    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6734-00000014"/> 24    JOHN SMTI ON A CRUTCH. bed, Whilc some of the other boys of the ward" began to wake up, and swear moderately because their slumbers had been disturbed. The murmur soon subsided, however, Thomas seemed to sleep, all grew quiet, and I lay down again. I was just getting into a comfortable doze, when Thomas started suddenly, sprung out upon the floor, between his bed and mine, making the whole house quiver, placed his hands upon my stomach, and leaped clear over me and my bed at a bound. At first, I thought my "time had come," for I fancied he was about to " slash " me in two with a knife; but having executed the gymnastic feat just described, he with- drew his hands, and stood in a kind of crouching position, trembling like a leaf-especially like an aspen leaf. "What's the matter?"I asked, trembling about as much as he. "Hush!" he whispered, in an awful manner. "They're at the window! They were pointing their muskets in! One of them touched me on the head. Look! See their bayonets at the window! Where's my knife? Reach and get it for me from my pants' pocket! Do!" "Wait a moment," I replied, "till I go to the door and look out. I want to see how many there are." My object was to get out into the- hall, go and wake the Doctor, and inform him of this sad case. "No, no, no, no, no, no!" he said, quickly, at the same time jumping about four feet high, and coming down on the floor like a thunderbolt; "don't open the door! They would all rush in!"   JOHN'S ADVENTURES WITH A CRAZY MAN.   25 "Only the hall-door," I persisted, beginning to rise. "They're not in the hall. Stay here, and I'll get you a musket to defend yourself with." The muskets belonging to the guards off duty were kept on a kind of rack in the hall, immediately adjoining the room I was in. I did not wait to hear any further remonstrances on the part of Thomas, but leaving him standing there trembling, as only a man suffering from delirium tremens can tremble, I seized my two crutches-for I used two then- stalked to the door, went out into the hall, closed the door after me and hastened to the room in which the Doctor slept, which was on the same floor. It was some little time before I succeeded in getting him awake, and when I did, he growled out in an ill humor, asked what in the deuce I wanted, imagined I was some one come to rob him, seized his revolver, cocked it, threatened to blow my unhappy brains out, called to me to " halt, or I was a dead man;" and, in fact, he was, altogether, quite playful. "Don't shoot I Don't shoot 1"I fairly yelled. "It is I, Doctor-I, John Smith!" "What do you want-waking a fellow at this time of night?" he demanded. "Are you sick? Do you want medicine?

"I am not sick, at all. O1 the contrary, am quite well-thank you. But-" "Well, what is the matter?" "I came to tell you that Mr. Thomas is raving mal. He imagines that a provost-guard is after himl and that he is to be shot as a deserter; and he is scampering about over the ward, like a rat in a hot stove. He talks strangely about cutting people's hearts out; and he may hurt some of the boys." ", is that it?" said the Doctor, now wide awake. "Well, I'll attend to him!"And he hurridly turned out and drew on his unmentionables. Accompanied by the Doctor, a light, and a guard of two men armed with muskets, I soon returned to "Ward A, and found Thomas raving like a "wild man of the woods." He imagined himself already attaoked by a company of soldiers, and he was ham- mering away at my empty bed with his big fists, and cursing and swearing like an officer of the Reegular Army. All the boys of the " ward" were now wide awake, and more than scared. They were all crip- ples, and some of them still in a weak condition, and they really had much to fear in case of Thomas's becoming generally pugnacious. "What do you mean, Thomas?" demanded the Doctor, angrily. "Do you want to go into the guard- house right now? or will you lie down and take a night's rest?" 'They've surrounded me!" vociferated Thomas with a profane oath. "And I'll not be taken! I'll sell my life as dearly as possible! I will!"   "Confound you!" said the Doctor, vexatiously. "You'll cheat the man that buys it; then!-seize him, boys, and put him in the cellar. Put on your panta- loons, Thomas; you must sleep in the cellar to-night. You shall not carry on in this way." Much to my surprise, Thomas at once cooled down, and became perfectly tractable. He offered no re- sistance, nor showed any signs of disobedience, but straightway drew on his trousaloons, put on his blouse, placed his cap on his head, with the visor shoved down over his eyes, and quietly accompanied the guard, and allowed himself to be locked up in a strong room in the basement. So, our peace and tranquillity were no more invaded till roll-call in the morning. When one of the guards went to give Thomas his breakfast, he found him sitting with a grave air on a low stool near the door of his prison, with a large bloody pocket-knife in his hand. There was a pool of gore on the floor at his feet, and his ineck and breast were terribly gashed. "Why, Thomas!" exclaimed the horrified sentinel, "What have you done?" "Some fellow," returned Thomas, in a calm, and even dignified tone, " murdered my father last night in the room above, and-- pointing to the blood on the floor-"his blood ran down here. Some of it fell on me, but how could I help that?" "But what are you doing with that knife? You have surely cut yourself." "O," he retorted coolly, as he pointed to his lace- rated breast, "I have been merely trying to get my    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6734-00000016"/> 28    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCI. heart out. I had hold of it once, but it slipped out of my hand." There was a wild look in his eye, and he presented a rather dangerous appearance with the gory knife in his hand, and his clothes stained with blood. The sentinel paused a moment, then duty triumphing over fear, he advanced boldly, and said, in an authori- tative tone: "Give me that knife!" Without a word, Thomas submissively handed him the bloody instrument, with which he had been at- tempting self-destruction. It was a large knife with eating-fork attached, such as was much used by sol- diers during the war-the blade being about four inches long. Having secured this weapon, the sentinel closed and locked the door, then hastened to inform the Doctor of what had occurred. Thereupon Thomas was conducted to an upper room, his wounds- twenty-two in number-were examined and dressed, and he was put to bed. There were two Doctors at the hospital at the time, and both expressed a like opinion on the case of poor Thomas. They said they wouldn't be surprised if he should die, but yet, that it was possible he might get well-if "kept quiet:" so, by this non-committal course, they did not endanger their reputation.   PROPOSES TO LEAP FROM A WINDOW.    29 CHAPT    R I11. PROPOSES TO LEAP FPQOM    A THRD-TroRY lINDOW. Y OR some days, the recovery of' Mr. Thomas was very doubtful. Some one had to stay with him continually, and especially at night, for at that dreary hour, " when churchyards yawn," and one ex- periences an inclination to sup on hot blood," (vide Hamlet,) he was in the habit of raving a good deal, and of threatening to destroy himself, and the greater portion of the human race. By and by, "sitting up" with him got to be a rather sleepy task, and as there were not very many whole men about, it was necessary for the cripples to take turns at it. One night, a week or so after the attempted suicide, my turn came. I was told early in the evening that I was detailed to get up, at twelve o'clock, and stay with the sufferer till three. At the appointed time, I was awakened by one of the nurses, arose, dressed, and proceeded to the invalid's apartments. I en- tered the room with some misgivilngs, and relieved a one-armed "hero," who had been watching since nine o'clock. The latter retired at once, and left me alone    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6734-00000017"/> 30     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCI. with the patient. The latter was asleep at that time, and the single candle that was burning in the room shed a ghastly light over his ashen feae, and the white bandage, slightly blood-stained, that was bound around his unhappy neck. "He is asleep now," the one-armed soldier had said, before withdrawing, "and may not give you any trouble. If he should awake and try to hurt you, ring the bell." The bell-wires, et cetera, used when the building was a hotel, were still in good working order, and all that lent me courage was the bell-pull that hung down close to my ear, when I had taken a seat on a chair near the door. I was just getting into an uncomfortable doze, when the patient waked up, awoke me, and raising up1 quietly in bed, remarked: "I believe I'll jump out of this window." He said it as coolly as a man in good health would say: I believe I'll take a walk." It was a third-story room, and the bed stood im- mediately by the window. I thought of the disas- trous consequences of such a proceeding on the part of Thomas, and earnestly advised him not to thinkl seriously of embarking in such a colossal enterprise. The window was raised about two feet, it being a warm night, and he gazed wistfully out into the som- bre darkness. "Don't do it, Thomas," said I, with earnestness. "We are at least thirty feet from the ground, and in your present condition it would not be judicious. AV':it till yoll get "wh, at least."   PROPOSES 'TO LEAP FROM A WINDOW.   31 ' You jump out," le suggested, turning and looking upon me with a wild stare. He seemed to have just thought of it. What could be my excuse, for not taking a .flying leap in the dark, I being in sound health-what there was of me? I glanced furtively at the bell-pull, and replied: O no; not from that window. You see, that is a back window. The laundress has some clothes hung out to dry just below, and it might injure them. Besides, I am in the habit of doing my leaping from a fourth-story front window. You'll always find, Thomas, that a man of refinement prefers a leap from a window of the fourth floor." He sat awhile, in a sort of thoughtful attitude, while I kept one eye on the bell-cord, and the other on him; then, to my relief, he deliberately lay down again, drew the covers close up to his chin, and glided off into a gentle slumber. I had no more trouble with him. Thomas got well, in the course of a month, left off drinking, and got to be a pretty sensible sort of fellow. The last S time I saw him was one day, some months after I 1 had left the hospital, when I returned to the old place on a brief visit. He was engaged in a four- hand game of euchre, and I observed, just as I ar- rived, that he held in his hand both bowers, ace, king and queen: would you believe it?--he had the temerity to play it "alone," and the extraordinarily good luck to make " four times."

T HE inmates of the hospital were allowed passes, after roll-call in the morning, to go into the city, or whither they pleased; but it was imperative that they should return by half-past seven in the evening, positively, without fail. One morning, as usual, I got a pass to go into the city, and as the Doc- tor handed it to me, he said: Don't fail to be back at half-past seven." "I won't," I replied, with the best intentions in the world. As new patients arrived almost every day, some of whom might be ignorant of the rules and regulations, the Doctor had got into the habit of repeating this in- j unction every time he gave out a pass; and as he gave, on an average, about one hundred and fifty per day, Sundays excluded, he must, in the course of a year, have said, "Don't fail to return by half-past seven," forty-six thousand nine hundred and fifty times. I had just stepped from the street-car in the heart of the city, when I ran squarely against one of the boys of ny own regiment, whom I had not seen since the battle of Antietam. "11llo, Charlie!"I exclaimed, delighted to see the   -4:: -      LOCKED UP.        33 familiar face of my comrade; "what are you doing here?" "I have been in the Chestnut Hill Hospital," was his reply, as we shook hands. "I was wounded at Fredericksburg, and am just well enough now to re- turn to the regiment: I go to Washington to-day. What are you doing here?" "I am staying at Haddington Hospital," Ireturned, "waiting to have a Palmer leg fitted on me that is made of willow, and only weighs three ounces and a -half." "Come and go to Washington with me," he said, as the thought appeared to strike him. (It struck me rather forcibly about the same time, I confess.) "I couldn't -H-" "Why couldn't you?" "Because I only have a pass till evening." "Oh, that will make no difference. They will hardly be so strict with the cripples." "When do you go?"I asked, thoughtfully, "At eleven o'clock." "Where is the regiment?" "Lying at Upton's Hill. Come-you'll go with me!" "I might get into trouble," I said, wavering. "I only have a pass till half-past seven, and if I should go away and stay whole days-" "O, pshaw! They wouldn't care. You have no duty to perform there." "No, but----" "O, come," he urged-all I wanted was a little urging-" the boys would be so glad to see you  3    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6734-00000019"/> 34     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. You don't know how they felt about your losing a leg at Antietam!" This argument completely disarmed me. I had not been with the regiment since I was carried away from it in the smoke of battle, and, O, I knew that the boys would be glad to see me! No one who has not been a soldier knows how dear one's comrades are to him! And especially his messmates--those with whom he has slept many a time on the cold ground, and under the same narrow tent; those with whom he has drank fromn the same canteen, or eaten from the same scanty dish! The attachment that grows up among companions in arms is like no other. It is not like paternal or fraternal love; it is not like the love of lovers; but it is as fond, as deep, and as lasting! I accompanied my comrade to Washington, thence to Upton's Hill, and saw the " boys ;" and I think I never enjoyed so much true happiness, in the same length of tine, as I did during that pleasant visit. I never thought of my being absent without leave, till I neared Philadelphia again. Then I began to wonder if " any thing would be done with me " on my return to the hospital. I tried to persuade myself that there was no danger of any thing of the sort, but something would keep whispering to nme that I was going to ( get into trouble."7 I arrived at the hospital again just one week from the day I had left. The roll was regularly called, both in the morning and in the evening, and I could not suppress an involuntary shudder, as I thought of the fourteen roll-calls I had evidently missed, and of the fourteen blac7c marks that were surely placed, by   -LOCKED UP.        35 this time, opposite the honest, unassuming name of Smith, John. However, I put on a bold face, walked up the hos- pital steps, paid no attention to the guard, who said, "Where the deuce have you been all this time?" walked in, and calmly reported myself to the surgeon. "Doctor," said I, K"it isn't half-past seven yet, is it?" (It was about two o'clock, post meridiem.) I had hoped he would enjoy this joke, and good- naturedly laugh the affair off, but I saw no such indi- cations on his stern countenance. "Where have you been, Smith?" he asked. Do I say asked? I should say, demanded. That is putting it mildly enough. "I went to Upton's Hill to see my regiment," I replied. "Exactly.  Upton's Hill. Let me see-that is-" "Upton's Hill," said I, "is about eight or nine miles from Alexandria, by the pike. From Wash- ington, it is situated--" In fact, I  was going on to deliver a first class lecture  on geography, when  he interrupted me with: "So you went there, eh?  A pretty way to act I I gave you a pass a week ago to-day, as the records will show, telling you to return by half-past seven, and, until now, have not seen you or heard of you!" "Well," said I, still hoping that the affair might be accepted as a  joke, "I am back, you see, before half-past seven. The mere matter of a week -"  .  * . -    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6734-00000020"/> 36     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "Go to your ward," interrupted the Doctor, who did not seem to be in a joking mood. "Glad to get off so easily," I muttered to myself, as I withdrew. "I really did begin to get a little scared; but it's all right now. I believe I'll go and write a letter or two.' Now, there was at the hospital, acting as sergeant of the guard, a contemptible little fellow named Kinsley, who had never been wounded, and probably had never seen any active service. I do not remem- ber what regiment he belonged to. He was very fond of displaying his sergeant's stripes, paper collar, and delicate little mustache. I had not been in my ward long, when this pompous little fellow came in with a key in his hand, approached me and said: "Come and go with me, Smith." Observing the key, I at first supposed that new quarters had been assigned me-in truth, I was nearly right-and I arose and followed him. He led the way up one flight of stairs, then another, then another. We had not quite reached the fourth story when the horrible truth suddenly flashed upon me. I was to be put in the guard-house-yes, the GUARD- HOUSE I "Sergeant," said I, pausing on the stairs, "I half believe that you contemplate locking me up." "So I am ordered," he replied. "I've considered the matter," I continued, coolly, "and have come to the conclusion not to go." "But you've got to go," said he. "There's no use in  " "No, I really don't think I'll go : not right away,   "OCKED UP.        387 anyhow," I said, coolly; and I turned about and began to descend the stairs. He quickly followed me, and roughly seized one of my arms. Letting my crutches fall; I turned im- petuously upon him, and with all the fire of assailed dignity, seized the foppish little sergeant by both arms, and hurled him down the stairs with all my might. I tumbled down after him, however, for I had not then such command of my equilibrium as I have since acquired, and we landed at the foot of the stairs all in a heap. I was up first, and snatching up one of my crutches for a weapon, I stood with my back to the wall, and proposed to " split his skull " if he should dare to approach. He did not dare, how- ever, but with a savage oath for so small a man, he picked himself up and ran down the other two flights of stairs. I deliberately followed. I was half-way down the last flight, when the Doctor and two guards, armed with musket and bayonet, appeared in the hall. "Doctor," said I, u' did you order me to be put in the guard-house?" "Yes," he replied, frankly. "You have no right to do it," I said, with some force. "I am a sergeant, and cannot, without a trial, be confined in a guard-house." "But you can," he retorted, "if there are men enough here to carry you up. Go, boys, and put him in No. 41." The two guards came up to me, and one of them said : "Come, now, you see we are ordered to do it. We don't like to, but--"    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6734-00000021"/> 38    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "I will go with you," said I, "for I know you are a soldier; but if that dandified little sergeant comes within reach of me, I will break his head!" I again ascended the stairs, for I. saw that resistance would be both useless and wrong; and one of the guards, inserting the key, opened the door, and I walked in. Just then, the cowardly little sergeant made his appearance, rushed to the door, drew it to, turned the key, and tauntingly said: "Now I've got you, my fine fellow! You see a ser- geant can be put in the guard-house 1" I could not help acknowledging the truth of this, but did not do so to him. I merely promised to lick him as soon as I should get out. "You know nobody would hurt you, because you are a cripple," he replied, "or you wouldn't talk that way." "And you," I retorted, "who never went into danger enough to lose a limb, can well afford to lounge about a hospital, and bully over the cripples!" No reply was made: I heard them going down stairs, and I was alone in my prison! Fortunately, during my youthful days I had not neglected one important branch of my education. I had read, with deep interest, minute and graphic ac- counts of the daring adventures and hair-breadth escapes of Claude Duval, Dick Turpin, and Sixteen- string Jack, contained in a series of twenty-four octavo volumes, of one hundred pages each, handsomely bound in orange-colored paper, and illustrated with numerous spirited lithographic engravings, done on brown stone.   Is i: oLOCKETD UP.            39 There is no sort of learning that will not come in play at some time or other; and, with my extensive theoretic knowledge of prisons, it is not to be sup- posed that an ordinary hotel-room, with the lock on the inside of the door, would hold me very long. I looked about me for means of escape. The window was too high to think of taking a jump from it, as it will be remembered I had led Thomas to believe I was in the habit of doing, and as Chris. Miller had threatened to do; so I resolved to force the door open or die in the attempt. There was a stove in the room, without fire, of course, and I opened the door and peered in. It con- tained about eighteen quarts of ashes and cinders, and --a small iron shovel with an iron handle. I seized it with joy. I saw liberty beaming all over it. First I tried to insert the handle between the lock and the iron " catch," into which the bolt went, which was only secured by a couple of one-and-a-half-inch wood-screws. The crevice was too small, or the shovel-handle too big. I next tried a corner of the shovel itself: it entered the crevice, but it proved too pliable-it bent. Then, with some effbrt, I wrenched the handle from the shovel, and tried that end. It was smaller than the other end, and success stared me in the face. I inserted it in the crevice, and, with a reasonable expenditure of strength, pried the " catch" off, and it fell to the floor, in a somewhat bent and dented condition. The door swung open. I was free. Thus liberated, I walked calmly down stairs, and went out on the piazza, where the Doctor and a    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6734-00000022"/> 40    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. number of the boys were sitting, airing them- selves. "Doctor," I said, coolly, as I boldly confronted him, "I am not accustomed to sleeping in the fourth story: couldn't you give me a room lower down?"   ACCOMMODATED WITH A ROOM LOWER DOWN. 41 CHAPTER     V. ACCOMMODATED WITH A iROOM LOWER DOWN. "' NEVER saw a man stare with such pure unal- loyed astonishment as the Doctor did on this occa- sion. Not five minutes had elapsed since he had had me locked up in the guard-house, and yet, there I was-free. He stared at me for a moment as though I were an apparition from the dead, then stammered: "Why-why--is--is-this-John Smith?' "So I am called," I replied, coolly taking a seat on a bench. He arose from his seat, stared for a moment, again, with contracted brows and a puzzled expression of countenance, then said: "H-thought you-were put-in No. 4!" L So I was," I calmly replied. And I deliberately took a newspaper from my pocket and cast my eye over the late items. "How--how-in the name of sense-did you get outl?" "Q, i that was easy,"' I replied, carelessly, as I re- garded the paper more attentively. "Sergeant Kinsley," said the Doctor, calling to the insignificant little sergeant who was standing at the other end of the porch, " come here."    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6734-00000023"/> 42     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. The sergeant approached. "Didn't you put Smith in the guard-house?" "Yes sir," returned Kinsley. "Here he is," said the Doctor, pointing to me. "How did he get out?" KIinsley, who had not before observed my presence: started back, turned pale, and said: "H--don't know."' "Go and see," said the Doctor. Glad to get out of my presence, Kinsley ran up stairs, and in a minute or so returned, and reported what had been done. Now, if the Doctor had possessed the heart of a human being he would have suspended his persecu- cutions, after that-in a word, would have "let up" on me--but he seemed entirely impervious to good jokes, practical or otherwise, and was more than ever determined to punish me. ' Sergeant," said he, no doubt thinking he was per- petrating a joke-but I couldn't see it--"Smith wants a room lower down, he says. I think we can accommodate him. Put him in the cellar!" There was, in the basement, a dark apartment with an iron door-the same room in which crazy Thomas had been confined-and that was the "room lower down" assigned me on this melancholy occasion. "tWAill you go?" said Kinsley, standing off at a respectful distance: "Or will it be necessary to call the guard?" "It will be necessary to call the guard," I replied, folding up my paper, arising and taking a hostile attitude.   ACCOMMODATED WITH A ROOM LOWER DOWN. 43 "You might as well go with him quietly, Smith "-- the Doctor began. "No I won't," I interrupted. "Should I do so, it is not positively certain that he would get back in a sound condition, and you might lose a valuable ser- vant, who is not scrupulous about turning his hand to any sort of work." "Call the guard," said the Doctor. The guard was called. I was put in the cellar. Only a few dim rays of light found their way into my- dismal prison, and they came struggling through a small crevice in the double partition of thick pine boards that divided the "cell" from the knapsack- room. On this formidable partition I at once went to work, with extraordinary nonchalance, with a small six-bladed knife I had in my pocket. I think this course was much more laudable than that pursued by Mr. Thomas, when confined in the same apartment, with a knife for a companion. I worked diligently, cutting off one thin shaving after another, till night came; by which time I had actually cut a hole in the thick partition through which I could easily thrust my arm. Next morning, after a miserable fragment of repose on an old mattress, I arose early, and resumed my work. I had not been long at it when Sergeant Kinsley came down with some provisions for me, consisting of bread and water. I took the large tin cup of water from his hand, dashed it in his face, slammed the iron door to, braced it with one of my crutches, and went at my work again; while he, , *.     <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6734-00000024"/> "    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. strangling, sputttering and swearing in wild rage, locked the door, and rushed up stairs. Cutting, splintering and shaving, I worked away, and by noon, I had made an aperture in the wall through which one might have thrown a hat-that wasn't too wide in the brim. By and by, I heard some one coming down the steps, and a light from the door above shone down through the bars of the iron door. Some one un- locked it and entered. It was one of the guards- one who had been wounded in the service. "I have brought you your dinner," said he. "They only gave me some-bread and water for you, but I stole a nice piece of boiled beef from the cook- house. Here it is." '"Thank you," I said, gladly accepting the repast. "What did Kinsley say?" "O, he's as mad as a hornet! He said you threw the water in his face." "So I did." "Served him right," said the guard, laughing. "He's an overbearing young puppy, who never heard a bullet whistle in his life. I knocked hint down one day, and he has been civil towards me ever since. Not very comfortable down here, is it?" "Not very." "Well, you'll soon be out. I heard the Doctor say he would let you out this evening. He told me not to tell you, and I said I wouldn't. I meant, I wouldn't till I'd see you." I eat my dinner with a relish, and, after he had gone, I worked away at my new window--merely for   ACCOMMODATED WITH A ROOM LOWER DOWN. 45 pastime. I did not make it much larger that after- noon, but I trimmed it up around the edges, and got it into some shape, thinking it might do to put a pane of glass into, some day. That evening I was released, and informed by the Doctor that my name should go on the "Black List," for the space of one week. The " black list" was a list of the names of those who, for misdemeanor, were denied passes for a certain time. And on this roll was the noble name of JOHN SMITH, to be placed for seven days I thought the Doctor would relent by Monday morning, so I called on him at his office, and said: "Doctor, I should be most happy to visit the city to-day, and if you will have the kindness to favor me with -" "No, no, Smith," he interrupted, in a decided tone; "You can ]lave no pass to-day." "But--" "No use talking: you can have no pass to-day." I saw that he "meant it;" so I turned away for the time, and called again the next morning. "Doctor," said I, with a beaming smile, "there is a friend of mine in the city, whom I would like to see, and if-----" "You can have no pass to-day, Smith," he inter- rupted: " nor till your week is up. We have dis- covered how you cut the partition-wall when you were in the cellar. What did you do that for?" "To get out," I replied. "If I had known it," said he, with some severity, "I would have kept you in three days longer!"    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6734-00000025"/> "    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "Then I am glad you didn't know it," said I. "At least," he rejoined, "you can have no pass till your week is up. That will be on Saturday." I gave it up for that morning, but promptly re- turned and renewed my importunities on Wednesday morning. I was refused, as before, and peremptorily ordered not to solicit a pass again till Saturday. In accordance (?) with this order, I promptly returned on Thursday morning, and most earnestly requested the favor of a pass, stating that it was indispensable that I should visit the city that day. The Doctor re- fused again, and threatened to put me in the cellar again for three days, and place my name on the "Black List" for two weeks, if I should "bore" him for a pass again, sooner than Saturday. Therefore, I. concluded to go to the city anyhow. So I slipped out the back way, threw my crutches over the fence, climbed over after them, and, without being observed by the guard, made my way to the street-car that stood awaiting its starting-time, and got aboard of it: thus I clandestinely went into the city. There, the first thing I did was to call on Doctor Lewis, at his residence. He was controlling surgeon of Haddington Hospital, and I determined to make a "point." I informed him that I had not been very well treated at the hospital, talked nice to him, used the best language of which I was master, introduced foreign words and phrases, made vague allusions to law and history, touched on chemistry, gave him to understand that the assistant surgeons at the hospital were the most tyrannical fiends in existence, and that I was the very paragon of all human excellence; and,   ACCOMODATED WITH A ROOM LOWER DOWN. 47 finally, requested him to do me the slight favor of giving me a standing pass-that is, an order addressed to the assistant-surgeons at the hospital, commanding them to allow the bearer, John Smith, "who had friends in the city, with whom he might desire to stay a night now and then,"-to pass in and out of the hospital, day or night, for all time to come. This, Doctor Levis,-who, I must say, is a perfect gentle- man, and was beloved by all the wounded soldiers under his charge-wrote, signed, and gave to me, without a word of objection; while I poured out the overflowings of my grateful heart in the most profuse thanks, and earnestly begged him, in case he should ever visit Western Pennsylvania, where I then re- sided, to call on me by all means, assuring him that he would be as welcome as a brother. The Doctor smiled, and, with renewed thanks, I put on my cap, picked up my crutches, saluted him a la militaire, bade him a cheerful "good morning," and withdrew.    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6734-00000026"/> 48     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH, CHAPTER    VI. THE WAY SMITH GETS BOPED.--AN EPISODE. TAVING taken a stroll of six or seveA hours about the city, I proceeded to Market street, and got into the first car going westward. Soon after, a digni- fied gentleman, whom I liked the appearance of,-and I modestly think he liked the looks of me,-got into the car, and occupied a vacant seat directly opposite. He glanced at my crutches, then at the vacant space where my left leg should have been, if I had pos- sessed one, and said: "How do you do, sir? You lost your leg in the army, I suppose?" Just here, reader, before I tell you who this excel- lent gentleman was, pardon a slight digression. Did it ever occur to you that one who has lost a limb in the service of his country, finds it necessary to an- swer "a question or two" now and then-to put it mildly-for some time after his return? He is looked upon as public property, and is almost bored to death with questions, by the many curious strangers he meets. No one who has not experienced it, can imagine what a nuisance this quizzing is. I can never have a moment's rest in any public place. I no sooner take a seat in a car, restaurant, or lecture-   THE WAY SMITH GETS BORED.    49 room, than my right-hand or left-hand lady or gentle- man commences. I give below an impartial list of the questions they ask, and which I, at first, answered with pride and pleasure; but which, however, after I had answered them a few hundred thousand times, grew rather stale. Here they are: they have been asked me so often, as to become stereotyped upon my heart and brain: Did you lose your limb in battle? -What battle? Did a cannon ball take it off? A rifle ball, eh? Did it knock it clear off? Did it sever an artery? Did it hit the bone? Did it break it? Did you afterward find the ball? Was it crushcd out of shape? Did you fall when hit? Did you walk off the field? Who carried you off? Did you feel much pain? How long after you were wounded till it was am- putated? Who performed the operation? Did you take chloroform? Did it put you to sleep? And didn't you feel the operation? Not even the sawing of the bone? Could not your limb have been saved? Was it taken off right where the wound 'was? Can von wear an artificial leg? 4    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6734-00000027"/> 50     JOEIN SMITIt ON A CRUTCH. Would the Government furnish it if you could? Do you draw a pension? Iow much-? How old are you? What is your name? What did you do before the war? Don't you often wish you hadn't lost your leg? How does a person feel with a leg off? Dces it (ache when the weather changes? Would you rather lose a leg than an arm? I have heard persons say that an amnputated limb still feels as if it were on-is that so? How do you account for that? All these questions, dear public, I have answered thousands of times, and may have to answer thou- sands of times yet, if my miserable existence is lengthened out for many years. Imagine how it must torment mne! The same old questions, to me long since devoid of interest, I must meekly answer, over and again, day by day, week by week, year by year! How Awould you like to commence and repeat the A B C's five thousand times every day, as long as you live?--Be pleasant, wouldn't it? But this is not all. After the affable stranger has asked all the ridiculous questions he can think of, he commences, without being solicited for a narrative, and entertains (?) me with a glowing (?) account of the army experience of one of his relatives-his son, nephew, cousin, or wife's uncle's brother's cousin, and I must patiently listen. Ile, poor fellow, goes the story, was wounded, too: arm or leg nearly torn off; barely hanging by a bit of the hide. Doctors   THE WAY SMITH GETS BORED.     51 wanted to carve it off. He wouldn't let 'em. But they said he'd die unless his limb was amputated. Said he'd die all in one piece, then, and save the trouble of digging two graves: wasn't going to die a piece at a time. Doctors said they knew best and limb must come off. "Hero " declared they didn't, and that it shouldn't be cut off, and, moreover, he'd shoot 'em if they tried it. Hence, limb left on. Patient got well, although Doctors said wouldn't live a day, "and to-day," continues the narrator, "the limb is sounder and stronger than before it was wounded." I have heard ten thousand such stories told of persons I never knew, never saw, and never heard of, and never wished to hear of. Yet I had to sit and listen. How interesting!!! Nor is this all. I occasionally meet with one who, in addition to all this, asks a few questions and makes a few remarks too ridiculous to be believed. Once, a gentleman who had been quizzing me for half-an- hour in a street-car, gravely asked: "Don't you think there are a great many unneces- sary legs taken off, by army surgeons?" He meant, I suppose, "legs taken off' unnecessa- rily," and I thought so; but he had been boring me till I felt pale and looked like fainting, an4d I replied: "Yes. I think that, strictly speaking, all that are taken off are unnecessary, for those who lose them manage to live without them." He didn't bother me any more. On a similar occasion, a gentleman asked: "Do you ever go away and forget your crutch?"    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6734-00000028"/> 52     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. When too late, he perceived how ridiculous the question was; but I gravely replied.: "Yes, I once went away and left it standingr in the corner of a restaurant. I went several bundred vyards before I missed it; and I then had a deuce of a time getting back to it." Another once thoughtfully asked: "Now, suppose you had lost your left arm instead of your left leg, where would you have placed your crutch?"He never considered that in such a case it -would not have been necessary for me to use a crutch at alL. "Then," I replied, "I would have used the crutch under the right shoulder, and a cane in my left hald." Another idiot, one day, after having asked the usual questions and entertained me with the usual incidents, consolingly remarked: "Well, you don't have to pay so much for shoes." "I never pay any thing for shoes," I replied. "For boots then," he suggested, with a complacent smile. "No, nor for boots either," I replied. "Why so?" he asked, with some curiosity. "I buy neither boots nor shoes." "How then?" "I buy only one." Thus, dear public, am I, John Smith, tormented for having sacrificed a leg for my country. How often have I felt that I would be far happier if I were still a mark for the bullets at Malvern Hill Bull Run, or Antietam! This accursed quizzical dis-   THE WAY SMITH GETS BORED.     53 position on the part of the public has made me feel, at times, that life was actually a burden to me! One day I met an elderly lady in Philadelphia who stopped me on the street, asked a profusion of ques- tions, and wound up by giving me an accurate history of her son. She said he had gone into the army, had been missing ever since a certain battle, and she feared he was no more. Ever after that, whenever we met-and it happened frequently-she would hail me, commence with, "I've never heard from my son yet!" and talk at me till I felt weak in the knee. At last, I met her one day, and pretending I did not see her, I was passing by, when I felt her grasp on my elbow, and was obliged to stop. "My son's dead," she said. "I've heard from his officers, and they say he was killed." O, how I envied him! Sleeping peacefully in a quiet grave, somewhere, with nothing to trouble him, and no one to torment him with questions, he must have been happy compared with the wretched John Smith! The old lady began again to give me his full history, as she had related it-to me many times be. fore, while the cold perspiration started from my framle, and I felt as though death was not two doors from mle. Thus am I bored without mercy. No one spares me, except such as have been in the army themselves. Men, women, children, foreigners, fools and even negroes, subject me to this systematic torture. One day I was walking in fiont of the Naval Asylum, when two little girls passed me, on their    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6734-00000029"/> 54    JOHN SMTII ON A CRUTCH. way to school. When they had passed, I heard one of them say: "O, look at that man with one leg 1" "Hush!" said the other. II How would you like it if your pa had but one leg and a little girl would call out that way." "He aint anybody's pa," retorted the first. "How do you know?" rejoined the other.   cJOHN SM[ITH'S FRIEND.     55 CHAPTER    VI I. JOHN   SMITH'S  ,FtIEND. TtOW   let me proceed. The gentleman in the Market-street car spared me. The questions he asked were few and to the point. He was an exception. When I replied in the affirmative to his first question, he said "Where do you live?" "In Western Pennsylvania," I replied. "Vhere are you staying now T?' "In Haddington Hospital." "I suppose you will soon be discharged?" "  Yes, I shall soon take my discharge." "Have you any employment in view?" ' No, sir; none." "If you would like to remain in Philadelphia awhile, when discharged from the service, I will get you a situation. 5 This rather took me by surprise, but I had the pres- ence of mind to say,---- "Thank you I think I would like it."7 "Then," said he, " call at my office near Fifth and Chestnut and I will do as I promise.

"Not at all," he returned. " hen 1 do any thing for a soldier I am only paying an honest debt." I returned to Haddington in triumph, and ex- hibited my pass to the assistant-surgeon who had put me in the guard-house. "Didn't you know," said I, with dignity, "that Doctor Levis and I were particular friends?" ' No," said he, turning slightly pale. "Are-are you acquainted?" "Acquainted!" said I. "I should think so! We've known each other for-for-I don't know how long." I didn't know exactly how long, but knew it was something short of twenty-four hours. "Ah? You should have told me. I am sorry. Well, go in and out of the hospital whenever you please." I will," said I." From that time forth I had perfect liberty, during my stay at the hospital. In June I got my artificial leg, which I have never Mworn mu(h-finding a crutch and cane far superior as a means of locomotion-and having received my dis- charge, T called one fine morning at the United States Marshal's office. It was early, and he had not come in yet. To pass the time, I walked to the corner of Fifth and Chestnut streets, and stood for a moment gazing at the good old clock in the State-house steeple. Streams of people were passing up and down the street; and I had: not stood long before a man came up and held out lhis liand as though, I thought, to shake hands.

I stared in astonishment. "Take it," said he: "you're welcome to it." I was dumb with amazement. Was the man an escaped lunatic? Might he be dangerous, like Thomas of the hospital? I felt like " getting." "Take it," he repeated, still presenting the trifling bit of fractional currency: "I owe it to you." I rwas still lost in wonder. Could it be possible that it was some country gentleman to whom I had lent the sum of ten cents before the war, and that he was so honest and upright as to return it on the first opportunity? No, he must be mistaken. I had never seen him before, certainly. "My dear sir," I said, " you are mistaken. I never lent you -" "O, not that," he interrupted. "You've served your country; you've fought my battles for me, while I stayed at home; you've got crippled, and now-- "Really, sir," I interrupted, smothering my indignation, "I am not in need of pecuniary assistance On the contrary, my income is ten thousand dollars a year." (That was a big one.) "If you wish to do good to the amount of ten cents, pray give it to some one who needs it. I thank you." I spoke the latter words with dignity, and turned away disgusted. Since that day, I have ever feared to stop a moment at a street corner, no matter how tired I    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6734-00000031"/> o58  '  JOHN SMTITH ON A CRUTCH. might be, lest some other unpardonable fool slhould chance to be near, and bring a burning flush of crim- son to my face. The idea of being suspected of so- liciting pecuniary assistance, simply because I stood resting at a corner with a crutch in my hand! It is so revolting to me that I can not look back on that little-extremely little-incident without a shud- der. Another reward for serving my country. O, John Smith! John Smith! I saw Mr. M *  *  * x - . , who, remembering me at once, gave me a letter to Colonel C * * * * *- , a blunt, but good-hearted old soldier, who at once procured me a situation in the United States Arsenal. I remained in my situation eight months, during which I saw a great many queer things, and got a pretty- fair idea of the purity, (?) probity (?) and in- tegrity (?) that prevail among the men who have charge of such public institutions.

T   IAD always been of a literary turn; so, while employed in the Arsenal, I concluded to write a book, and give to the world, therein, an account of soldier life, as I had experienced it; and I had very little doubt that eighty or ninety thousand dollars might be made out of it. I carried out my determina- tion, writing in the evenings, after my daily labols; and when I left the Arsenal, I had completed the manuscript of my work, which, when published, a few months after, constituted a duodecimo volume of over four hundred pages.* I did not make " eighty or ninety thousand" out of the work, as my sanguine nature had led me to anticipate; but I made a "few thousand," and I concluded to travel a little and see some of that por- tion of the world lying within the boundaries of the United States: and it was while thus traveling, OUR BYS.

The first time I visited New York, I went to re- main a few weeks as correspondent of a Pennsylvania newspaper. I think any stranger's first impression of Gotham is, that it is a busy sort of a place; and the longer he stays there the more he "keeps on thinking so." The bustle of Broadway has been so frequently dilated upon, that I will not attempt to enter upon a regular description of it. It munst be seen to be appreciated; and I concluded to see it the - first thin. So I hailed an omnibus that came thundering along, and somewhat astonished the driver by climbing nimbly to the top of it, instead of taking a seat within. "You get up quicker than a two-legged man," was his brief comment. "Havn't so much weight to pull up," I replied; and paidl my fare. From my lofty perch I had a good view up and dorw Broadway, as well as on each side. Number- less pedestrians thronged the sidewalks, while vehi- cles, of all kinds, shapes and sizes, crowded together, rolled along and swayed to and fro in the street like a mighty torrent. We had not proceeded far up Broadway, when cluck! went one of the front wheels of our "bus" against another one that was coming down-they got tangled and a "jam-up" ensued. Although I could not see that it was the fault of either driver, they cursed each other in round terms. One driver swore   JOHN THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL. 61 at the other, and the other swore at him; then they swore at each other, in concert, for a quarter of a minute, in the course of which they were very ear- nest and emphatic in advising each other to emigrate to a certain fabled climate where the mercury in the thermometer seldom falls to the freezing point. The way these drivers curse each other is frightful. If all the men told to go to that hot climate in the course of a year by Broadway drivers, should go, the place would be crowded to suffocation.  The expression I refer to seems to be a favorite one among the driv- ers of vehicles on Broadway; and I presume, that on that thoroughfare there are more men urged to visit Erebus in one day, then there are warned against it in all the rest of the land in a whole year. For about two miles up Broadway, the rattle of omnibuses, express-wagons, drays, furniture-cars, bug- gies, barouches, cabriolets, etc., was really bewildering. As I looked upon the busy streams of men that hurried along the sidewalks-their faces all strange to me, yet no two alike-and saw   the rumbling carriages, all crowding forward as though life de- pended on their speed, I could not help thinking of this stanza in Byron's Childe Harold: "But 'midst the crowd, the hum, the shock of men, To hear, to see, to feel and to possess, And roam along the world's tired denizen, With none who bless us, none whom we canrbless; Minions of splendor, shrinking from distress!

Every one who has had any experience in the matter, rmust lhave observed that a person is more lonely in a crowded city, where he is unacquainted, than in tile depths of the forest where no human being is seen. As I had no money to throw away, I stayed at a modest hotel in Park Row, where one could live on less than twenty-five dollars a day. I shall never forget a brief acquaintance I made there. The first evening I stayed in New York, I was seated in tilhe hotel trying to make up my mind whether to go to the theater or not, when I observed, sitting near me, a sedate gentleman of prepossessing exterior, fifty or sixty years old, and dressed in plain clothes and a broad-brimmed silk hat, of a grave and dignified appearance. I could not help fancying that he was at least an ex-governor, or something of the sort; and I felt somewhat flattered when he moved his chair closer to mine, with the obvious intention of addressing me. Hie opened his mouth to speak, and I nerved myself to reply with respectful dignity, when he said, in a low tone: "TWould you lend me fifteen cents?" Thie man was a " dead beat." I resolved never to place much reliance on appearances again. Having made up my mind to go to the theater alld see John E. Owens play "Solon Shingle," I walked out. At the door I met a solitary boot-black, who greeted me with, " black 'em?" "You may black it," I replied, "for you see I have only onto black." "All right," said he; whereupon I seated myself (D I   JOHN THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL. 63 on a low railing that guarded a cellar-way, and placed my foot on his box.. He had soon "shined" it sufficiently, but was still brushing away at it, when I said: "rlThere, that will do; what do you charge?" The dirty, ragged little fellow looked thouc}ht- fully and earnestly up into my face, and replied: ", O I won't charge you any thing; you're only got one.            , I compelled him to accept a ten-cent note, of course, assuring him that I had "bushels of 'em ;" but the intention was no less kind in him; and such a noble thought, though the poor little heart from which it sprung be clothed in rags and filth, will shine in heaven when the rust has long covered and hidden the millions of gold which men of wealth have con- tributed to " charitable institutions!" Before leaving New York, (which is ironically styled Gotham, from an old English town  noted for the stupidity of its citizens,) let me say one word about its early history. New York, the great comn- mercial metropolis of this country, is built on an island fourteen miles long, and from one fourth of a mile to two miles and a half wide, called, originally Manhattan Island. This island was purchased from the Indians many years ago for twenty-four silver dollars. No wonder that race of people have had such bad luck during the last century; for any people who would extort .such a  sum of money from simple, in- offensive Europeans, don't deserve any providential favors. Poor, impoverished New York has been struggling ever since to get out of debt, but in vain;    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6734-00000034"/> "    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. this colossal sum, which the heartless savages de- manded in ready hard cash, completely " strapped" the mayor and city council, and they have never been able to struggle up to an independent pecuniary position since. Shortly before leaving the city, I was taking my usual stroll, when, turning the corner of Broadway and Fulton street rather abruptly, I accidentally planted my crutch fairly upon the unfortunate toes of an elderly gentleman. lie proved to be one of the irascible sort-and no doubt it did hurt like the deuce-and he turned angrily toward me, brandished a cane, and vociferated: "4***-*'* fire and ***nation! If you were not a one-legged man I'd knock your head off!" Thus, you see, that having lost a leg saved my head. I felt a little riled at first, but seeing that he was an old man, I curbed my fiery passion and calmly replied : "If I were not a one-legged man, sir, I would not be using a crutch; and hence it wouldn't have happenied." And we went our ways. Without getting robbed, or garroted, or murdered in cold blood-in fact without getting " done " in any shape, I spent several weeks in New York, visiting many places of interest in the vicinity, such as Central Park, High Bridge, and the various islands in the bay and harbor; and finally returned to Philadelphia, my adopted city, with the impression that New York wasn't such a bad place after all.   SEA-SICK.        65 CHAPTER     'IX. pEA-SICK.-JJ GH! TN January, 1865, I concluded to visit the New England--otherwise called  the "Yankee" or / "Eastern "-States; and thought I would at once strike for Boston, Massachusetts, which is called the "Hub of the Universe," and, make that city my head- quarters during my stay in the '"land of steady habits:" that means the six New England States; Maine, New   Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Islanld, and Connecticut. The habits of the people of all the rest of the United States are very nsteady. I fancied that a " sea voyage " must be a delioghtful thing, according to all that poets and novelists had said about the "deep blue sea," the " ocean wave," the "rolling deep," and-the like; so, I determined to go by sea. I  toolk passage aboard a large propeller one squally day, and away we went, amid the ice and snow, down  the Delaware river, down the bay, and out upon the bosom of the " mighty deep." Yes, and it is "mighty deep," as Davie Crockett would have said-a   "mighty sight" deeper than is really neces- sary, mzerely for the encouragement of navigation and Lhe culltivation of whaleos and sharks!    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6734-00000035"/> "    JOHI SMITH ON A CRUTCH. I had heard of such a thing as " sea-sickness," but I believed it was half imagination, and that any brave heart could bear up against it. In a word, I resolved not to get "sea-sick" myself.  The mate of the vessel told me that it was "more than likely"I w ZUould feel a little "squeamish " when we should get r out where it was " rough "--that was, if I had never been to sea before. I didn't believe it, though. We started on Saturday morning, and it took us all day to get "outside." During that time I eat three hearty meals on board the propeller, for travel- ing on the water lent me an appetite. It was only eWlt, for I returned it. Well, about dark that evening, we got out where it was "rough."  The vessel began to roll, pitch, and plunge, and I heard the sea roaring, the waves splash- ing over the deck, a few loose articles on board rattling and tumbling about; and I began to wonder if everything about the vessel was secure. I sat on a sofa in the cabin, and presently, I began to feel- well, I felt, in a word, that a " voyage" was, like all other enjoyments, not quite what one anticipates; ebut still, well enough. Then, immediately,I felt a little--j ust a little-" worse." I didn't like the way the cabin was throwing itself around: it made my head feel queer. I thought that if the vessel would just stop rolling for half-a-minute, I would feel all right again. It didn't stop, though, and I rapidly began to feel all wrong. In a word, I grew dizzy. Dizzy? O, no! That's no fair expression. I rather felt as thougch I was a large cask filled a little too ftull of mixed white lead, putty, or something heavy   SEA-SICK.          67 that way, and that the head was forced down upon it with considerable pressure-especially about the stomach, where I fancied one of the hoops of the imaginary cask might be located, and about the "brow" where the upper hoop might be, did I expe. rience this indescribable heaviness. I imagined the heavy cask (myself, John Smith,) to be rolling and tumbling about loose, and the white lead or putty straining to get out. I couldn't stand that thought. The mate came into the cabin, asked me if I wasn't sick, remarked that I looked " deathly pale," and ad- vised me to " turn in " as quickly as " the law would allow me." "Where "I asked, as I rapidly grew sicker. "O, dear! Where'll I sleep?" "iere!" he said, hastily opening a stateroom door very near me. "Get in there. I'll help you. Take the lower bunk. You will be the only passenger in this room." In fact, there were but few passengers aboard. As I attempted to rise, the ship gave a playful lurch, laid over on her side, then quickly tossed her- self upon the other side, and if the mate had not caught me, I should have plunged clear across the cabin and' tumbled back again, far more quickly than a  man could have walked it. My crutch and cane escaped me, however, striking an opposite stateroom door in less than a second, and throwing themselves savagely about over the cabin floor. "Never mind them just now," said the mate. "I'll help you in." And he helped me in.    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6734-00000036"/> 68     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "There's a bucket hanging to the side of the berth," said he. "l If you should feel a little sick- -" Ugh! Human nature couldn't stand it any longer.

Bauh-gosh-gslish-shesh! O, lordy I The ship was tossing about like a man intoxicated, and I, worse still, was tossing about like a man sick drunk; I heard the wind howling, for it was blowing hard, the waves dashing overhead, the ship creaking and groaning; and I groaned, and prayed for land or death I Then I regretted that I had ever been born. I also reproached the fates for having sent me to sea in such stormy weather, and solemnly vowed-and I kept that vow for nearly a year-that, in case I ever reached land, (which I now thought rather unlikely), I would never, never, never venture out upon the broad ocean again! O, O, O, O, Ugh! Gushshsbshsh! O, how I wished the ship would stop rolling for just a moment! But it wouldn't stop at all. It rolled, and plunged, and tossed, and tumbled, and pitched; and I got sicker, and sicker, and sicker, till I imagined nmyself at "' death's door," with my hand on the bell- handle. To gain a slight conception as to how I felt, fancy. how a boy would feel, if, when sick on his first cigar, he were not allowed to throw it away, but forced to retain it in his mouth and smoke away! Thus it is with one who is sea-sick. The motion of the vessel causes it, and swhen a fellow grows dizzy, and feels vretcledl about the bottom of the vest, he can't throw   SEA-SICK. .        9 that motion away, like a cigar. It has made him sick, it makes him sicker, and don't even stop when he gets "deathly sick." To treat a patient scientifically, physicians remove the cause of his illness; but in this case, the cause--that is, the motion of the vessel- cannot be removed, and there is nothing left for the unhappy patient but to get "used to it." The only thing I remember of that fearful night, except pure, unbroken, unalloyed misery, is that I asked the captain, as he passed through the cabin, if it was actually storming. He carelessly replied: "O0 it's only blowing a fresh little nor'-wester ;" and passed on. A fresh little nor'-wester! I groaned in agony, and rolled about in my berth, thinking that if that was only a fresh little nor'-wester, what a fearful thing a stale big nor'-wester would be! Next morning at daylight the steward came to my berth and asked me if I could "eat something?" Eat! Whew?    Ugh! The very thought came near bringing on a relapse. "No, no, no!"I shuddered; and buried my face infy bunk. About ten o'clockhe passed' through the cabin and I asked him if we were " out of sight o' land?" "Out o' sight?" he returned. "Yes, and have been for ten hours!" I  felt somewhat better--in fact, a good deal better than during the terrible night just passed--and I de- termined to make my   way to the deck to view a scene that had never before blessed my  eyes. The wind had abated, but the waves ran high, and the vessel was still rolling considerably. Feeling light-    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6734-00000037"/> 70     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. headed and queer, I got out of my berth, grasping something all the time to keep from being spilled out into the cabin, got my crutch, left my state-room, and began to move toward the companion-way. By hug- ging the wall, grasping state-room door-knobs, and the like, I reached the foot of the staircase without falling, and looking up-the hatch being open-I saw the blue sky staggering about overhead. Holding firmly to a polished brass railing, I ascended to the deck and took a seat on the companion-hatch. Before me and all around me was the long-wished- for sight. Our ship, the dark-green sea, the sun, the clear blue sky and a few wild sea-birds flitting about, were all that the eye could find to rest on. The sea and sky met on all sides, forming a grand and mighty circle around us. I remember remarking to myself, in my enthusiasm, that to see such a sight as this, was "worth risking a fellow's life!" To do " old ocean " justice, I must say that there is nothing in the world more delightful than to be at sea a little while in mild weather; but when a gale is blowing, as I have since seen it, the ship going to pieces every hour, and the was foaming, and snarl- ing, and gnashing their teeth, as it were, in their im- patience to get you and strangle you; then you natu- rally wish there wasn't such a thing as a sea in the world; or that your lot had been cast in the " new world," where "there was no more sea." (Revela- tions xxi. 1.) On Monday we came in sight of Cape Cod, and I thought we should never get round it. Those who have noticed Cape Cod on the map have no doubt   SEA-SICK.        71 observed that it is shaped like a human foot; and we went gliding along near its sole, traveling from heel to toe. For hours, I was every moment expecting to go " round the point," which I imagined I could see all the time a little way ahead: but it kept re- ceding all the while, like an ignus faturus, till I began to fancy that the foot belonged to some great giant, who was bending his knee, and drawing it back stealthily, in order to straighten it out again and give us a kick. $    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6734-00000038"/> 72     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER X. THE It JUB." WE arrived in Boston Harbor Monday afternoon about four o'clock, and entered a very dense fog about the same time. The fog was so thick for several minutes tlhat lob)jects could not be seen flr'om one end of the vessel to the other. The engine was quickly stolpped, and we narrowly escaped a col- lision with a steamer. But in the course of ten ilinutes, the heavy mist swept down the harbor in a body, and left all clear around us; when we were somewhat surprised to find ourselves within one hun- dred yards of the shore. We floated up to the pier at the foot of State street; the propeller was soon made fast, and I immediately went ashore, in the midst of a soaking rain that seemed to be sent just then for my express benefit. I got into a carriage-- ole that had sleigh-runners substituted for wheels- and rode to a good comfortable hotel which the Cap- tain had recommended. It rained till after dark; and, in fact, I retired to my room, went asleep and left it raining. I re- member that I heard some one remark, just before I retired, that if it kept on raining ,-he didn't say how long-it would spoil the sleighing, and wheels would   THE HUB.         73 come into requisition again: for in the New England States, especially Massachusetts, and those lying north of it, a vehicle with wheels is seldom seen in the depth of winter. The sleighing usually con- tinues good till spring, and the wheels are removed for a time from all vehicles, and runners are adjusted in their stead. Not even the street-cars or omni- buses are any. exceptions: they, too, cease to rattle, roll and rumble over the streets, and go gliding about with so little noise that one gets the queer idea into his head that they are barefooted. Next morning I discovered that it had cleared off, and that the thermometer had gracefully descended to zero. [Well, that was nothing.] In fact, during the ensuing six weeks which I spent in the New England States, the sleighing continued excellent, and the thermometer ranged pretty generally from about five degrees above zero to five below. To be sure, we had a cool night or two, now and then, when it went down to ten or fifteen below; but no one thought much of that. Such is the character of the winter in New England-the good old-fashioned kind that a fellow likes to see. I glanced over toward Charlestown early on the morning after my arrival, beheld Bunker Hill Monu- ment towering far above tne smoke-stacks and steeples in the perspective; and I determined to visit itat once. I accordingly climbed to the top of an omnibus, cold as it was-for I wanted to see all I could-and rode over. It is not universally known that the battle of Bunker Hill is so called because it was fought on    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6734-00000039"/> 74     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. Breed's Hill. The latter is near Bunker's IIill, and it is on Breed's Hill that the monument now stands- and always has stood since it was built, (for they never moved it.) The reason the battle was called the battle of Bunker Hill, and, consequently, that the monument is styled the "Bunker Hill Monument," is, that the engagement should have been fought there. Colonel Prescott was sent with a thousand men to throw up earthworks on Mr. Bunker's Hill, which overlooked Charlestown Neck; but either mistaking his instructions, or not being acquainted with the vicinity, he took possession of Breed's Hill instead, and threw up an earthwork there in rather unplea-  sant proximity to the British fleet in the harbor. The monument is built of granite, is about twenty- five feet square at the base, and about twelve or fifteen at the top; which top is accessible by means of an interior winding stone stairway, dimly lighted with rather small jets of gas that are too few and too far between. At intervals of about twenty feet there are narrow apertures to let in air; and that cold morning they let in too much. During the previous night, too, the rain had blown in and frozen on the stone  steps, so that fully one half of them were perfectly  enameled with ice. To ascend these with a crutch under such circum- stances was no less than a dangerous undertaking. The superintendent advised me not to try it, but I could not act upon his advice, from the fact that I had " made up my mind" to go up. (It's a wonder I didn't "go up," in another way.) If there had not been a small iron railing to cling to, I could never   TIE HUB.         75 have reached the head of that almost interminable staircase. As it was, I came near falling backward, and only saved myself by clutching this railing. Should one start to fall down these steps, nothing would save him. They wind around and around, with here and there only a narrow landing, not more than twice the width of a stair, and too narrow to arrest the progress of a descending form. One might as well leap down from the top, either outside or within the circular shaft around which the stairs wind, as to go tumbling around and around, down, down, down, the solid spiral stairway, thumped and beaten by the edges of two or three hundred stone steps; for in either case I suppose that brandy and water wouldn't save him. I reached the top pretty tired, after having ascended two hundred and ninety-five icy steps; and from this height of two hundred feet, had a good view of Boston, Charlestown, Roxbury, and the harbor. Finding it rather cold up there-for there were several good sized windows open for the wind to blow in at, and visitors to look out of-I soon made up my mind to descend; in fact the cold was so severe that it had a rather benumbing effect on me; and as my thigh and the calf of my leg fairly ached from my recent exertions, I fully realized the danger of descending, and fancied I would have made a considerable pecuniary sacrifice to be safely at the base of the tall structure. There was no way to get there, however, but to walk down, if it might be so called, and I began the perilous descent. I was not half way down when my crutch and cane both slipped    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6734-00000040"/> 76     JOITN SMTTIT ON A CRUTCH. from an icy step, and I fell. O, what a fall there would have been, my countrymen, if I hadn't caught the iron railing! I gripped the cold iron with my right hand, and arrested my crutch with my left; but my cane escaped me, and away it went, tumbling knock- ing, cracking rattling and clattering, till it reached the bottom. I fancied it took it something like a minute to make the descent, but the probability is that the time it occupied in the journey was not more than ten seconds. It's last echo had just died away; when I heard the voice of the superintendent calling to me from below; and his voice had a kind of twisty sound by the time it wound its way up to me. "(Did you fall?" he asked. "No," I replied, telling a white one, "I merely threw my cane down because I can get down better without it." I did, however, get along better without it, for I could now grasp the railing all the time with one hand while the other held the crutch. Well, it is not my intention to write an ordinary book of travels. That has been done too often. All the places I have visited have been described time and again; and I will only entertain the reader with my (John Smith's) odd adventures therein. While in Boston I had the pleasure of an introduc- tion to Mrs. Partington. That amiable old lady is a jovial, round-faced old gentleman of fifty-five or sixty. His name is B. P. Shillaber, and he is connected with the Boston Gazette. iHe is a noble-hearted, excellent gentleman; and the people of this country owe him   THE HUB.         " their thanks for the many happy smiles his eccentric and inimitable pen has called out upon their faces. Long life and many happy years to Mrs. Partington I I remained in New England during the rest of the winter, and had a pleasant time and many sleigh-rides. I visited Lexington, Lowell, Lawrence and most of the large towns of Massachusetts; Manchester, Con- cord and Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Bellows Falls, Rutland and Burlington, YVrmont; and Portland and some smaller towns and cities in Maine. In the city of Portland I hired a horse and sleigh one morning, and resolved to drive a few miles into the country. It was snowing vigorously, but was t not very cold; I had a spirited horse before me; a good light sleigh under me; and away I went, bound- ing over the road, neither knowing nor caring whither I went. By and by, when I had traveled five or six miles, and distanced a number of other travelers, in similar vehicles, on the way, I saw a town just ahead of me. The snow was still falling so briskly that I was almost in the town before I saw it. As I drove along, I asked a boy what, place it was, and he said, "Westhrook." .I entered the village, and found it to be one of considerable extent. In fact, I drove half. a-mile, and still there was no end of houses. On the contrary, they became thicker and thicker; and I began to conclude that "Westhrook" must be quite a city. By and by I found myself on a street that re- minded me forcibly of one I had seen in Portland; and, what made it more remarkable, I observed that it rejoiced in the same name. What a coincidence I But I marveled more still, as I followed this street a    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6734-00000041"/> i(    JOHUiN MlUlT QON A U1UTU1. little way and passed an hotel that was the very im- age of the one I stayed at in Portland-and lo there stood at the door a porter who was dark-s kinned and  cross-eyed, exactly like the porter of my hotel in that city! Was I dreaming? No, not exactly; but I must have been during my drive, for I had wandered around among the country roads in the snow-storm, lost my reckoning, and actually entered Portland again. I had come in through a little suburban vil- lage, north of the city, called "Westhrook;" and   - hence my delusion.  In Rutland, a beautiful little city nestling in a kind 1 of basin high up among the Green Mountains of Ver- mont, I arrived one night at a late hour. I went to a good comfortable hotel-for they have such there-  and asked for a "single room." The host regretted that he had no single rooms unoccupied. Passengers: from the earlier trains had taken them all. He could put me in a double-bedded room where another guest had just retired-one who appeared to be a," perfect gentleman :" that was the best he could do. It was the best I could do, too; so, I was shown to the room. I had a few hundred dollars in my pocket, and, not being perfectly sure that the man in the other bed was a perfect angel, I thought there would be no harm in placing it in the watch-fob of my unimpeachables, and placing the same rolled up in a ball, under my neck. I did so. When morning came, the "other fellow " got up first, and I felt somewhat amused when  I chanced to observe-for I was awake, and dreadingo to ' turn out" on account of the sharp morning air-- U,   TDn. t u B.       79 that he had done so too. We had both taken each other for rogues. Well, that is the right way to view every stranger when you are traveling. Look on every man you meet, and especially if he speaks to you, as a deep-dyed villain, till you have had the most incontrovertible proof that he is not. I made Boston my head-quarters, while visiting different portions of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts; and about the last of February, I departed for Philadelphia. I didn't try the "dark- blue sea" again; but took the "Shore Line " railroad, stopping a short time in Providence, New Haven and New York. I arrived in New York one March evening, and, allowing my baggage to go on to Philadelphia, re- solved to remain in the city that night and go to the "Quaker City" rext day. I wanted to go via the Camden and Amboy Railroad, and was told that the boat-fbr passengers on this road take the boat from New York to South Amboy, a distance of twenty- eight miles-would leave at six in the morning. That evening, while in the sitting-room of my old hotel, I observed two suspicious-looking fellows eye- ing me rather sharply, and I felt that they were entitled to a little watching from me. So, 1 watched them. When I retired, I locked and bolted my door and even braced it with my crutch. [A handy thing to have in a house, sometimes.] I slept soundly till five o'clock, at which time the porter, according to instructions, knocked at my door and awoke me. There was no one in the hotel below, when I went    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6734-00000042"/> 80    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. down but a sleepy porter, and I was wondering where my suspicious-looking friends (?) were, and where they stayed, and congratulating myself that I was escaping them nicely by going away at that early hour in the morning, when the street-door opened and the two identical gentlemen stepped in, and took a seat by the stove. Pretending not to notice them, 1 stepped out. It was still far from daylight, and the snow was flying merrily. The wind was howling, and each blaze of gas in the street-lamps was fluttering and struggling as though it might go out at any moment. I wanted to go to Pier No. 1, North River, from which the boat was to start, and 1 walked as fast as I could-and that was not slow-toward Broadway, glancing back over my shoulder at intervals of two seconds, to see if my villains were coming.. It was the quietest hour I ever saw in New York. Not a stage, carriage, cart or car was astir in that part of the city; and neither policeman nor " any other man was to be seen. The snow and wind combined were fairly blinding, and it was very far from being a : fine morning." I had nearly reached Broadway, when I looked back and saw the two dears coming, a square distant. They were passing a lamp-post, and the glimpse I caught of their figures convinced me of their iden- tity. Without exhibiting any haste or trepidation, I walked on to the corner of Broadway and Park Row and turned to the left; but instead of walking down Broadway, suddenly stepped aside and stood in the door-way of Barnum's old Museum-whch was A;l"   THE HUB.         81 standing at that time, but over whose ashes Bennett's majestic marble palace now stands-leaned my cane up in a corner, drew my revolver, cocked it, and awaited the attack. I had just completed my preparations for a defence of my position, when the happy pair came. The light of a street-lamp at the corner shone full upon them, and I must have been blind indeed if I had not re- cognized them., Their hats were drawn down over their eyes, to shield those organs from the driving snow, and as I was in the shade, they failed to see me, and rushed by. They were running, their footsteps soon died away, and their "forms" faded down Broad- way, which was then as quiet as a country lane. I was very well satisfied to escape an encounter with them, because I preferred not to shoot them, as I would certainly have found it necessary to do had they seen me. I knew they would soon discover that I had dodged them, and return; so, replacing my revolver, taking my cane, and keeping an eye down Broadway, I glided across the silent thoroughfare, went down Vesey Street to North River, and thence down West Street to Pier No. 1, which was not really much out of my way. I, - I reached the boat in good time, and arrived in Philadelphia that day by twelve o'clock. 6    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6734-00000043"/> 82    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH.

I intended to occupy three or four weeks, and made arrangements to act meantime as correspondent for a paper. Nothing unusual happened to me on the way to Baltimore, except that on looking from a car window at Havre de Grace, a small particle of cinder from the engine flew into my eye; which kept it red and inflamed, and furnished me with first-class pain, at in- tervals, for the ensuing two weeks. A bit of cinder from a locomotive, with all its "fine points," is, I think, the severest thing that can work its way into a man's optic organ. Had rail- roads been in vogue in the days of King John, what a point young Arthur might have made, when remon-. strating with Hubert who had been authorized to burn his eyes out with a red-hot poker, and elo- quently descanting on the sensitiveness of the eye, by reminding him how it felt even when a cinder   NARROW ESCAPE IN A ROW AT BALTIMORE. 83 from a locomotive got into it. For example, how would the passage read in this shape?- "O, heaven! that there were but a mote in yours, A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wand'ring hair, Or the ten-thousandth part of a dead spark From the smoke-stack of a lo-con'-o-tive; Any annoyance in that precious sense 1 Then, feeling what small things are boisterous there, Your vile intent must needs seem horrible!" It will be perceived that the two lines in italics are my (John Smith's) own production: the rest is Shakspeare's. I will not venture to predict what critics will say of the relative merits of the two authors in this case. As the trains from Philadelphia enter Baltimore, they cross a wide, clear, quiet street, called "Broad- vay." It bears no resemblance to the Broadway qf New York, as it is occupied chiefly by private dwell- ings. The trains always stop there a mifnute or two to allow those who wish to get off. This street runs north and south and of course crosses Baltimore street, the principal business thoroughfare, which runs east and west. The Baltimore-street railway extends down Broadway, and as several cars are always in waiting when trains arrive, many passengers get off the train here, take a street-car, and. ride into the heart of the city. I always do so when I visit the "Monumental city."  I did so on this occasion, having first instructed the baggage-express agent to send my trunk to my hotel. As I jumped from the train, (before it had quite stopped,) and walked toward the street-car that stood    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6734-00000044"/> 84:    JOHN SIITH ON A CRUTCH. waiting on Broadway, a soldier approached me, and tapping me familiarly on the shoulder, said: "Why, Locke! how are you?" I saw at a glance that he had mistaken me for some one else, and soberly replied: "I believe this isn't I." "O, so it isn't! Excuse me," he said, perceiving his mistake and laughing at my joke. I got into a crowded car and rode to my hotel on West Baltimore street; for the principal street is divided into East and West Baltimore streets by a canal, which it crosses near the center of the city. Having a week or two before me, with very little to do, I determined to see all the places of interest in the vicinity, for I had, theretofore, neglected to visit them, although I had frequently been in Baltimore, I had never even visited the Washington Monument there. Here let me commend Baltimore for being the only city that has ever erected a monument to the memory of that pure-hearted patriot to whom we are indebted for our liberties and free institutions- GEORGE WASHNGTON! Baltimore has another monument which was erected in honor of the Maryland soldiers who fell in the war of 1812; and is hence styled the "Monumental City." The Washington Monument is indeed quite a fine structure. It is built of marble to the height of about two hundred feet, and its top is adorned with a large statue of the "Father of His Country." Within, is a spiral stairway of stone, like that in the Bunker   NARROW ESCAPE IN A ROW AT BALTIMORE. 85 Iill Monument; but it is not lighted with gas, nor has it any embrasures for the admission of air and daylight. The superintendent, or some one employed for the purpose, accompanies each visitor, who wishes to ascend, carrying a lantern. He may well be termed a man who has a great many " ups and downs" in the world. From, the top of this monument, the view of the city is excellent; almost every house in it can be seen. Of course, I visited this monument, but as nothing extraordinary occurred, and especially nothing funny, I will not entertain the reader with a full description of my visit, nor of the monument itself. I was always fond of rowing, and as the weather was mild and pleasant next day, I concluded to go down to the harbor, hire a boat and take a row. I was told that I could get one at the foot of a little street running obliquely toward the piers from the junction of Broadway and Pratt streets, the latter being the street on which the Philadelphia trains run into the city-and I took a street-car and went down. When I asked the man for the boat, he looked at my crutch and said: "Can you row?" I told him that reminded me of a lady friend of mine, who shortly after my return from the " field of glory," asked me if I didn't find my corporeal defect very inconvenient about eating. "Why shouldn't I row?" said I.  "A man don't hold the oars with his toes, any more than he holds his knife and fork in them when eating at the table-which would look rather odd, and render it necessary for    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6734-00000045"/> 863    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. him, instead of sitting in the usual manner to take a somewhat novel position." No further doubts were expressed as to my ability to row, and I got into a fifty-cents-an-hour boat, aind rowed out into the harbor. "Be careful,'} was the owner's admonition as I pulled away, " that you don't get caught in a squall and be driven away. The weather is uncertain in March." "No danger," I replied, and my boat glided out to where there was a stiff breeze blowing, and was soon dancing on the waves. I moved toward the southeast a mile or so, rested awhile near a ship that was lying at anchor, and had a chat with one of the mates. I was beginning to pull away from the ship, when I heard an excited voice toward my right sing out: "Look out there I Where the deuce are you going?" Immediately followed a confusion of voices, the ringing of bells, and the shriek of a steam whistle. I turned in the direction, and was somewhat alarmed to discover that I was about to cross the: bow of a propeller, that came dashing along. IIad I pulled the oars but once more, nothing would have saved me from being run down. My boat would have been shivered to pieces, I would have been stunned, and my chances of being saved from a watery grave would have been as one against a hundred. With all the presence of mind I could command, I " backed oars," and checked my boat, which of its own accord turned side-wise; and the propeller rushed by, at   NARROW ESCAPE IN A ROW AT BALTIMORE. 87 such a trifling distance from me as to strike the blade of my right-hand oar. "Whew! my young man," said the mate with whom I had been talking-for he still stood by the bulwark--" you came near going down." I fully realized this, and quite satisfied with my row, put back for shore. The wind had increased, and I now noticed, for the first time, that some dark clouds were coming from the west. I had a good mile to row against the wind, which, as well as the waves, was every moment increasing in violence. I was yet a quarter of a mile from the dock in which the boat belonged, when a regular squall came on. Then I had a time of it. Throwing off my coat and hat, and placing them in the bottom of the boat, I grasped my oars and pulled away with all the strength and energy I possessed. I made rather slow time, and when within one hundred yards of port, perceived that I was just making out to lie still against the wind. I was nearly exhausted, and felt like throwing down my oars in despair; but seeing what a short distance was yet to be accomplished, I nerved myself for a final effort; and such a battle as I had with the wind and waves no one need want to engage in. After ten minutes of the most strenuous exertion, I arrived in the dock, trembling from exhaustion, perspiring from exercise, and wet all over with spray. I concluded, taking my narrow escape into con- sideration, that rowing in the harbor was no delight- ful recreation, and solemnly vowed never again to  venture out there in a row-boat. I kept my word faithfully till next afternoon; when the weather    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6734-00000046"/> 88     JOHN SAITH ON A CRUTCH. being very delightful, I broke it, went out again, anl1 had a very pleasant row in the same boat. At four o'clock one evening I left Baltimore for Harper's Ferry, via. the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, having first sent my trunk back to Philadelphia by express. I arrived at Harper's Ferry by nine o'clock. A great many soldiers were there--for it will be recollected that the war was not yet ended-and I found it difficult to secure a comfortable lodging. Every private house was acting the part of an hotel, furnishing supper to many soldiers and a few sorry- looking travelers; while those desiring a night's lodging were packed into rooms at the rate of from seven to twenty-seven in each. By paying a few dollars extra, talking politely, and pretending that I was not in the best of health- although I eat an astonishing supper for an invalid -I succeeded in securing a small room to myself, to which I retired immediately after supper; and having carefully fastened the door, I lay down on a clean bed and slept comfortably till the morning.   HOW SMITH TRAVELED A-FOOT--AND MORE. 89 CHAPTER    XII. pOW SMITH TRAVELED A-fOOT--AND JORE. yJ HEN morning came, I tried for an hour to get ,v a conveyance to Sharpsburg, near Antietam Y  Creek, twelve miles distant; but in vain. Not a horse or carriage of any kind was to be had for love or money; and I made up my mind to walk it, although I had never yet walked any such distance on one leg. When a man makes up his mind to do a thing, however, he will do it, if he has firmness, no matter whether he has any limbs or not. At eight o'clock, I went to the office of the provost- marshal to get a pass over the bridge-for it will be recollected that the village of Harper's Ferry is on the Virginia side--but he had not come in yet. Wishing to start as soon as possible, I thought I would try to face my way over. So, I went to the bridge, bade the sentinel a cheerful good-morning, and was moving on, when he said: "Have you a pass?" "No," I replied, stopping. "I am not in the ser- vice. Is a pass necessary?" ' No," said he, after a slight pause. "Your crutch is pass enough. I suppose you got that in the Army?"  .    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6734-00000047"/> 90     JOIIN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "Yes," I repliccd, "at Antietam. I am going up there to-day to see the old ground." "How are you going?" "I'm going to walk." "Walk! Why, can you do it?" "I think I can, although I have never yet walked so far on a crutch." "You'll have a good walk of it. It is fully twelve miles." "Yes, so I have been told; but I could get no con- veyance, and must try it." "I hope you'll get along well." "Thank you." I passed on. When I reached the middle of the bridge, I could not refrain from stopping to admire the scenery, which had never before appeared so grand to me. IIarper's Ferry presents a rolmantic picture indeed. All around are tall majestic wood- covered hills that gaza. down upon the village and bridge with quiet and awful dignity; and the beauti- ful river, wandering silently about among them, looks as if it would never find its way out. It was the twenty-fifth of March, the morning was' pleasant, the sun was smiling on the heights and glancing down on the little village and the pure river. I thou(rht I had never before seen such a beautiful sight. I passed over the bridge, turned to my left and walked up the tow-path of the canal. The first two or three miles I got over in an hour 'or so, very smoothly; but after that I felt weary at times, and found it an advantage to rest every mile or two.   HOW SMITH TRAVELED A-FOOT--AND MORE. 91 By a quarter to twelve o'clock I had reacted the mouth of Antietam Creek, ten miles from Harper's Ferry, and had now to leave the river and strike over the hills for Sharpsburg, two miles distant. Nothing had happened to me during my walk, save that a stray bullet from- beyond the river had now and then whistled about my ears. They were no doubt fired at random by some of our pickets there who did not see mne. I had now to cross the canal,-in order to direct my course toward Sharpsburg. This was no easy matter. There was no bridge or lock near, and no ordinary jumper could clear it at a bound. I did fancy that I might make it in two jumps, but did not try. It was not full of water, and, seeing no plan but to wade through it, I removed my shoe, and other apparel liable to get saturated in the course of such an enterprise, and stalked in. I did not find it deeper than twenty-inches, but its temperature felt very little above thirty-two degrees, Fahrenheit, and it made my foot and the calf of my leg ache clear throt gh by the time I got across. Having passed this obstruction and replaced my shoe, etc., I went to a house not far off, where I in- quired the way to Sharpsburg, and was directed to follow a country road that took its way over the hill; and did so. I reached Sharpsburg by one o'clock, having walked a little more than twelve miles in five hours. There was an hotel there and having taken dinner, I started for Smoketown, three miles distant, where I had lain in the hospital. I visited the vil- lage-a village consisting of two dwelling-hotuses and    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6734-00000048"/> 92     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. a corn-crib-then returned to the battle-field and spent an hour or two traveling about in search of the spot on which I had received my wound. I failed to find the interesting place, although I had felt confident of being able to walk directly to it in a straight line. It is remarkable what a change takes place in a year or two in the appearance of the ground on which a battle has been fought. Thirty months had now elapsed since the battle of Antietam, and a casual observer would not have noticed any trace of the conflict. I saw a Mr. Miller plowing in a field opposite the little Tunker Church by the pike-a building that had been nearly knocked to pieces in the fight, but had since been repaired-and he showed me a full set of "bones" lying in a fence-corner, which he had just "plowed up." He said they had been scarcely under the surface of the earth; but that he would bury them deeper. This was the famous cornfield in which the struggle between Hooker's and Longstreet's corps was so terrible, and where so many of the Pennsylvania Reserves were killed. I found in this field several bullets, a fragment of shell, and a few canteens, straps, etc., lying about. As evening approached and I had walked from eighteen to twenty miles since morning, I started for Keedysville, several miles distant, with the intention of staying there all night. After the amputation of my leg at Antietam, as mentioned in the first chapter, I had lain in a barn near the creek, a week or two; and this evening, after crossing the creek and walking a little way toward   HOW SMITH TRAVELED A-FOOT-AND MORE. 93 Keedysville, I recognized this same barn, although I had never known its precise location: and O, what recollections of misery it brought back to me My sufferings in that barn were so terrible, so far exceed- ing any thing that might merely be termed pain, that, as I look back now, the time spent there seems more like a horrible dream than a reality! The sun was sinking as I stood in the road gazing thoughtfully at the barn; and I thought of the even- ings I had lain within, almost dead, and seen tl i sun's last red rays struggling into that somber apart- ment of misery, through the crevices. While I thus stood, a lady, who had come out of an adjacent house, approached me. Her footsteps as she drew near aroused me from my train of thought. "Good evening, ma'am," said I. "How do you do?   Will you walk into the house?" was the response. "iNo, I thank you," I rejoined. "I am on my way to Keedysville, and was just looking at this barn, which I recognize as one in which I lay for some days after the battle here." "Ah," said she; "were you one of the wounded ones who occupied the barn?"  : Yes, ma'am. Who is the owner? ' "Mr. Pry-my husband." "I have been on the battle-ground," I observed, "trying to find the place I was when woiunded." "And did you find it?" "I am sorry to say that I failed," said I. "A pity. Where did you come from to-day?" "Harper's Ferry."    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6734-00000049"/> "    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "How did you get up?"' "Walked." "'Walked! You surely did not walk it on one leg?" "Yes, ma'am, and this crutch and cane. I reached Sharpsburg by dinner-time, and have spent the after- noon in rambling over the battle-field and visiting Smoketown." "You surprise me. I did not suppose a person on crutches could do all that." "Nor did I till I tried it." "Well, you must go no further to-night. You were our guest before, and must be again, now that we are better prepared to accommodate you." "AVhy, really, I " "You musn't think of going any further. Why, you've walked twenty miles to-day--and on a crutch! No, indeed, you must not pass my house. Come in. Mr. 'Pry is just coming in to supper. Come, no excuses." I did not further decline the proffered hospitality of this excellent lady. I was ushered into the house, and was made no less welcome by Mr. Pry, his sons and a beautiful and amiable daughter. An excellent supper, a pleasant evening chat, a tidy bed, a comfortable chamber, and, O, such a delicious, dreamless slumber, after my day's exertion, made me forget all my weariness; and I awoke next morning-the beautiful Sunday morning of March twenty-sixth-with all the vigor of youth. Never let me forget the Pry family for their cordial wel-r come and hospitable entertainment!   ROMANCE IN JOHN SMITH'S REAL LIFE.  95 CHAPTER XIII. ROMANCE IN    fOHN 'MTHS ".JEAL  FIFE." T"HAT Sunday morning I determined to visit the battle-ground again, and try to find that part of the field on which I had had the honor to be shot; then walk to Hagerstown, a distance of twelve miles.- Having discovered, the previous day, that I was something of a walker, I now thought nothing of going that distance on foot. My excellent friends urged me to stay till Monday morning, but I declined. I have now to record a little incident such as we sometimes read of but seldom gain cognizance of through our own auricular and optic organs. It may well be termed a "Romance in real life." Once, while in the army, I had picked up a small white pebble on the battle-ground of Bull Run, in- tending to keep it as a relic of that famed field. I had put it in a port-monnaie, and' carried it with me through all my  battles. While lying in the barn alluded to, I had lost my port-monnaie, which only contained, besides the pebble, a small bit of white paper on which I  had made some notes of marches and their dates; and since then I had scarcely given it a thought. In fact, it had gone quite out of my mind. ri     <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6734-00000050"/> 96     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. Well, on Sunday morning, March twenty-sixth, 1865, before I left Mr. Pry's house, Mrs. Pry showed me a small fancy basket of curiosities, such as little shells, bullets, and the like and as she handed it to me to examine, she said: "You will find among those shells a little white pebble, to which there is probably some story attached." "Ah?"I replied, moving the shells about. "How SO? "Vhy, I think," said she, "that it must have been the property of some soldier who, no doubt, carried it as a relic. Our boys were fishing one day, not long ago, and one of them drew up on his hook a port- monnaie-and what a fish he thought he had --when "A port-monnaie 1"I exclaimed, as the recollection of my pebble suddenly flashed upon my mind for the first time since my leaving the army. "Yes," she went on; "and in it was the pebble !"And this is it!"I interrupted, as I found it at that moment among the shells and instantly recognized it by its peculiar shape and a little dark streak running through it. "Yes, that is it." "And do you guess whose it is? "Is it yours?" "Yes, ma'am. I recollect it distinctly now. I picked it up on the battle-field of Bull Run, when visiting the ground one day, before I had ever been in a fight, and carried it with me through all my   ROMANCE IN JOHN SMITH'S REAL LIFE.  97 campaigns, till wounded; and I lost it from my blouse pocket while lying in the barn. Was there not a piece of paper in the port-monnaie?" - "Yes, so the boys said." "With -some marches and their dates noted down "Exactly." "Well, is it not rather romantic!" "It is, indeed. The pebble is yours now. Take it." "Thank you. I am indeed glad to see it again; but if you prefer to keep it, a$ you have established an undoubted right to it as property, by rescuing it from the depths of the waters, I will cheerfully leave it with you." "No, no," said the good lady. "It is a pleasure to me to be able to restore it to you, after the lapse of more than two years. I am so glad I happened to mention it. If I had read of such an incident I could scarcely have believed it." "Nor any one. I thank you a thousand times! To think that, after thirty months, I should recover a little thing like that!--and that after it had been associating with the fish at the bottom of Antietarn Creek! To think that it should so happen that I should stop at this house all night and that you should happen. to mention it to me just before depart- ing! It is indeed romantic!" "It is, truly. Be assured that I am as happy to restore it to you as you are to recover it." I took the pebble, and have it yet in my possession.

(wherever that is,) will have an opportunity of seeing it, and of thus satisfying himself that this story is true. Accompanied by Mr. Pry's two sons, I departed for the battle-ground, in the midst of the most earnest solcitations to remain till Monday morning, and msde another tour of the battle-field. At last, we succeeded in finding the identical spot of ground on which I had stood when Shot, which I recognized by unmistakable landmarks. Especially did I remember a little ledge of rocks in the midst of a small grove of trees, over which we had climbed in advancing, and where two men had fallen back, shot dead-one at my right hand and the other at my left. I also found and recognized the identical tree against which I had leaned my rifle on finding myself to be too badly wounded to continue firing. There were some graves in the quiet little grove, and on a small head- board I found the name of one of my old regiment. Among some of the sunken graves, were also visible whitened bones that had barely been covered with earth, and were now, after the rains and storms of more than two years, entirely unearthed and exposed to vieVw. Between ten and eleven o'clock, I started for Itagerstown. The boys wanted me either to go back to the house or wait there till they should get a team ready to convey me to my destination, but I declined, assuring them that I could walk easily, and would really prefer to do so, as the weather was fine. I mnade my way to the Clagerstown pile, and had not traveled far, when I fell in with a fatrer who   ROMANCE IN JOHN SMITH'S REAL LIFE.  99 was returning from a Sunday-school he had been attending at the little church, and he urged me to go home with him and take dinner. Not wishing to stop so soon, I declined, with thanks. I met with several similar invitations on the pike. I must say, that the hospitality and kind-heartedness of the people of Maryland cannot be too highly spoken of. They had no fair opportunity to show these good qualities while whole armies were passing through their land, although even then they did all they reasonably could do for us; but let a person travel through the country districts, especially if he be crippled or labor- ing under any physical disadvantage, and he will meet with kind smiles of welcome from all, regardless of political sentiments. Having traveled four or five miles, I was passing a house *rhere dinner was just ready, when a good- natured old gentleman came out to the gate and said: "How do you do, sir? Stop a moment. Which way are you traveling?" "I am going to Hagerstown," I replied, pausing. "Well, you have not had your dinner yet," he said with a tone and manner that distinctly added, "So, of course, you simply walk in at this gate and up into the house and get your dinner, to be sure." "No," I could not help admitting; "but--- "But What?-- in the name of sense." "I am not decidedly hungry, and would like to walk a mile or two further before I stop." "O, nonsense! Come in!"And he opened the gate with such an air that I could not have remained    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6734-00000052"/> 100    JOtHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. in the road without insulting him. "Did you say you intended to walk to Hagerstown?" "t Yes, sir; such is my intention." "Well, you mustn't think of it. Come in, take dinner and rest awhile, and I will hitch up to my spring wagon and take you to Hagerstown in less time than it would take you to walk a mile! Come." I could no longer resist, and allowed myself to be smiled and welcomed into the house. The good peo- ple therein--an elderly lady and her daughter-were somewhat astonished when I told them of my walk of the previous day. "Is it possible you couldn't get a wagon?" said the old gentleman. "I could not." "If I had known it," said he, while his noble heart shone out all over his face, "I would have Vitched up and come down for you! Surely, there ought to have been some one there-However, people get pretty hard-hearted where soldiers are quartered so lonlg." "Very natural," I observed. After a good dinner, which I had the appetite to enjoy, this hospitable gentleman, despite my protesta- tions, hitched up his horse and wagon, and took me to IIagerstown. I offered to pay him, but he regarded tlhat idea as one of the best jokes he had heard lately. [No, indeed; I mustn't give a thought to such a thing! "The idea of taking pay from you 1" he said; and laughed till we both forgot about it.

CHAPTE'R   XIV. THE HUDSON. T SPENT the remainder of the spring and the first two months of the summer in New York, but as the extreme " caloric " of the " heated term " began to make the giant walls and solid streets of the me- tropolis next to intolerable, I determined to take a little tour up the Hudson, and out by the lakes into Ohio: and did. But my grateful heart will not allow me to pass quietly by New York again without briefly ac. knowledging the sincere thanks I owe, for dis- tinguished favors, to the following excellent gentle- men: Manton Marble, Editor of the WORLD; Drexel, Winthrop &amp; Co., Bankers, Wall street; Willy Wal- lach, Stationer, John street; Paschal S. Hughes, Merchant, Broadway; Henry S. Camblos, Broker, New street; and E. S. Jaffray, Merchant, Broadway. I can say no more.. Having made arrangements to correspond with a certain well-known journal, I started, about the first of August, on my projected tour, taking passage on the handsome steamer DANIEL DREW for Albany. They have on the Hudson river some of the finest boats in the world-low-pressure boats of immense   THE HUDSON.       103 size, that never think of bragging on speed that' falls below twenty miles an hour, Some of them, by straining a muscle or two, have made twenty-five miles an hour, and felt none the worse for it next morning. We started at eight o'clock one August morning; and what a change of atmosphere we experienced as we left the hot streets of the city far behind us, and glided up the Hudson-that most picturesqueond ro- mantic of rivers! The sky was bright and clear; and, however hot and close may have been the narrow and crowded streets of New York, the air with us was charming. Most of the passengers sat on the cabin deck, which was protected from the sun by an awning, that hovered over us like the ghost of some broad sail that Old Ocean might have swallowed. We had not gone far, when a band of musicians from the land of Horace, Virgil, Cicero, Titus, Vespasian and the Cesars, treated us with some melodious strains on the violin, harp, and some other instruments. Although we would have regarded them as a nuisance in front of our doors in the city, we now really appreciated their talent; and when they had played half-an-hour, and one of them came round with an empty hat in his hand, there were but. few, if any, who did not ac- knowledge their approbation by contributions of ten- cent notes, or the like. They had just disappeared, and I was beginning to regard the delightful scenery that began to unfold it- self to us along the shores, when a very black African made his appearance on deck, and leaning over a kind I   -  '  F A    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6734-00000054"/> 104    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. of sky-light, called out to some one below in a loud tone : "Hillo,illll, down dah!" "Well, what does you want?" was the response from below. It was evident that William was also a gentleman from the land where snakes, crocodiles, and savage beasts grow to their full size. "Are you gwine up to Albany?" asked the darkey on deck. "Yes, reckon I'se gwine up dah," came from below. "How'd you leabe all de folks?" "O well enough-but don't ask so darned many questions," said Bill, testily. "Gettin' rudder techy, ain't you?" "O, don't bodder me! I didn't git no sleep last night-I didn't." By this time the attention of the passengers in the vicinity was attracted, and all eyes were turned upon the darkey. As for myself, I felt somewhat annoyed, and wondered why the black cuss didn't go below and carry on his animated chat with his friend, instead of standing up there, yelling down, and disturbing the tranquillity of the passengers. "Well, why didn't you sleep? It was your own fault." "O, let me 'lone, Sam," came from below. "I don't want no foolin'!" "I won't let you 'lone. You ain't gwine to get: no sleep dis day, you isn't," said Sam, thrusting a cane he had in his hand down through the open sky- light.   THE HUDSON.        105 Some one appeared to seize it from below, and at the same time the voice of Bill said: "Now, look yere, I say, I'll break dis 'ole cane fur you, if you don't look out!" "Yes, you bettah try dat," said Sam, thrusting, the cane down several times, as though he were stirring a 'possum out of a hollow log. "Now you be keerful!" vociferated the voice below, angrily; and the stick was seized again and an effort made to wrench it from Sam's hand. "Let go o' dat now, I say," said Sam, at the same time freeing it with a savage jerk. "Den you let me 'lone," said Bill, in a kind of compromising tone. The passengers Were looking on in astonishment. It was rather singular that this black employe of the boat, as he evidently was, was allowed to come up among the passengers, and go to raising such an alter- cation through the sky-light with some one below. One passenger, who had been reading, seemed very much annoyed, and at last testily said: "O, let the fellow alone-whoever he is!" "I'll let you 'lone if I come up dar!" retorted the voice below, evidently addressing the irritated pas- senger. "Look out, Bill," exclaimed Sam;  " dat's a white gemman you's talkin' to! d'ye know dat?" "Don't car. for dat. He's no wuss dan a black gemmran," retorted Bill. "De white cuss!" "Confound him!" exclaimed the angry passenger, rising and going to the sky-light. "Where is he? I'll punch his head!"    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6734-00000055"/> 106    JOHN SMTII ON A CRUTCH. "Don't you wish you'd ketch me! IIa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" laughed the voice, in taunting exaltation; and now, to the astonishment of all, it sounded dis- tinctly as though it were on the awning above our heads. All looked up as though expecting to see the shadow of some one there, but only the broad beams of the sun covered the canvas from side to side. "Ha, ha, ha!  What's de mattah?" yelled the same voice. "Ha, ha, ha!" First it appeared on the canvas, then under the deck, next toward the cabin-door, next toward the bow of the boat, and, after apparently making a rapid circle around us, finally subsided in our midst-in fact, in the very mouth of the darkey who stood on deck. He was a ventriloquist-a skillful one, too- *and had been thus beautifully "doing" us all this time. As for "Bill," the darkey below, he was of course a fictitious personage. A loud laugh came from the passengers, as they realized this, and the irascible man, who had threatened to punch Bill's head, returned to his seat, trying to look unconcerned. Sam passsed around his cap for tokens of our appreci- ation of his powers, and each one-including the irascible passenger--contributed from five to twenty- five cents. That was the last "tax" we paid that day. I might give a long, and even interesting, account of my journey up the Hudson; but such is not my intention. There are already numerous books of travel extant, which describe the Hudson as well as it can be described in words. My object is to amuse;   THE :EUDSON.         107 and if I relate all the funny things that happened to me, I shall succeed. I might describe the view of the Catskill. Mountains, the towns of Hudson, Peekskill, Newhurg, West Point, etc., but will leave that to tourists, as already hinted. But I must not pass by without mentioning one or two points on the Hudson. The Catskill Mountains, viewed from the river, present so lovely a picture that neither pen nor brush can convey any adequate idea -of them. No one should live and die without viewing such scenery as this. A few miles above West Point, and on the same shore of the river-the' western-rises a mountain peak .called the Crow Nest. Joseph Rodman Drake, an American poet who died in, 1820, at the age of twenty-five, thus exquisitely depicts this delightfnl region, in his poem entitled, "THE CULPRIT FAY :" "'Tis the middle watch of a sumimer's night- The earth is dark, but the heavens are bright; Nought is seen in the vault on high, But the moon, and the stars, and the cloudless sky, And the flood which rolls its mnilky hue, A river of light on the welkin blue. The moon looks down on old Crow Nest, She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast, And seems his htge gray form to throw In a silver cone on the wave below; His sides are broken by spots of shade, By the walnut bough and the cedar made, And through their clustering branches dark. Glimmers and dies the fire-fly's spark-- Like starry twinkles that momently break Through the rifts of the gathering tempest's rack.

I don't think I succeeded. It is the most diffi. cult thing in the world to step off a boat or train in a strange city, and not fancy that at least half the assembled spectators are looking at you and saying: "There's a fellow who never was here before: that's clear." I went up to an hotel, gave my check to the porter and told him to bring my baggage from the boat. I have hitherto forborne to give the names of hotels, because it might look like surreptitious advertising; and John Smith is above that sort of thing. But, it might be urged, why not mention the names of the good hotels, that travelers who read this work may know where to stay when they visit, such cities as I mention? One reason is, this is no traveler's guide; and another is, that an hotel that was comfortable and well-conducted two or three years ago, may have changed proprietors, and become  quite the reverse by this time. I have seen this demonstrated myself, as I  may have occasion to mention in the course of this work.    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6734-00000057"/> "O    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. I remained at Albany a week, during which time I visited the penitentiary-only as a visitor, remem- ber-and other places of interest. I also visited Troy, six miles above, on the east side of the river, and some of its manufactories. At a nail and horse- shoe factory there I saw the largest wheel in this country. It is a monstrous water-wheel, which runs the machinery of the whole establishment. I was told that its diameter was seventy-four feet. -It was in operation while I was there; it revolved rather slowly, and looked like the world turning around on a cloudy day. At Troy I also saw a Trojan horse; though not the one Homer tells about. Before going westward, I paid a visit to Saratoga Springs, the great fashionable summer resort, which is about thirty miles from Albany. Do not infer that I went there to spend the fashionable "season." I am above such a place as that. So is any one that hasn't too much money. It is there that glittering wealth and giddy fashion congregate during the hot weather, and that merchants from New York and other cities go to gamble away in a week--sometimes in a single night-all they have made in a year. ' Faro '" prevails there to an alarming extent. So do poker, roulette, billiards, nine-pins and horse- racing. I stood by a faro-table for an hour, and the amount of cash I saw change hands in that time was something frightful. Thousands seemed but a trifle at that board. I saw one gentleman looking on with idle interest, while others were betting, losing and winning, and I said to myself, "That fellow is going to try his luck: I can tell by the way he looks.'"   Iy   ,JOHN AT SA RATOGA.            H And he did try it. "I'll put that V on the ace," said he, laying down a five-dollar greenback. It lost. "Pshaw!" said he; to which nobody paid any attention. The betting went on. Presently my man tried it again. "Here's an X on the ace." And he put an X on the ace. It lost. "Confound it!" he exclaimed, vexatiously. "Here's twenty-five for the deuce." He put two Xs and a V on the deuce. The ace won this time, and the deuce lost. And he lost. He was now forty dollars "out."' "Give me some checks," he said, handing a hundred- dollar bill to the banker. He was evidently going into it more extensively. The banker quietly took his hundred dollars, and counted him out some ivory checks used to represent cash in the game. The betting went on. He laid down five dollars' worth of checks on the ace and won. He laid down another five and lost. He laid twenty on and lost. He laid twenty more on and lost. "Confound that unlucky ace!" said he, "I will not try it again." So, he tried betting on two others at once. He laid five on the seven, and thirty on the eight. - The seven won and the eight lost. He won five dollars and lost thirty.    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6734-00000058"/> "Blast the luck 1" said he. "Here are the rest of lhe checks on the ace. I'll try my luck on it again." And he placed the remainder of his hundred dollars' worth of checks on the ace. And lost. He then abruptly mentioned the vulgar name of a place that is also called Hades and Erebus, and wished ugly wishes on himself if he'd bet any more. But he soon thought he would like to try it again-just once. He resolved to risk one bet of a hundred dollars, and if that should lose, he wouldn't try it again. ' Let me see," said he, "I'll put it on the ace. No, I won't. The ace is unlucky for me. I'll put it on the seven; that won for me once." He put it on the seven and lost. If he had put it on the ace that time be would have won. He then used profane language, and spoke very disrespectfully of the cards in general, and of the seven-spot in particular. Then he left the room. Presently he returned with a roll of bills in his hand-a thousand-dollar one being placed conspicuous- ly on the outside, as a kind of index, to show what was within. He handed a thousand-dollar bill to the banker, and said: Change that." The banker changed it. He then laid down five hundred dollars on the ace, and lost. He laid five hundred more on it and lost. He took another thousand-dollar bill from the roll, laid it down, and lost. He laid down another, and won. "Good luck, at last," said he. I believe that ace   ,l , AL AI ATOGA.    113 will win again It will be sure to: it has won so little of late." So he put three thousand dollars on it. Others followed his example, and two thousand dollars more were laid on the ace. All who sat at the table now, or stood by, looked for the issue with much interest. It lost. This most unfortunate of the gamblers made a slight movement of the hand, as though to place his remaining cash in his pocket and quit; but he hei- tated a moment, then placed the whole " pile " on the ace. There," said he, " are seven thousand dollars." Yes, seven thousand. The ace lost that time. The unfortunate man, who had now lost about ten thousand dollars, articulated a number of bad words and, turning away, left the room with as sad-lookiing a face as I ever saw under a hat. No one paid any and it would be no exaggeration to say that at least a hundred thousand dollars changed hands while I was standing there. I have merely mentioned this  one gentleman in particular, because his case was, perhaps, the saddest of any that came under my no- tice, and made the greatest impression on my lind. Whether he returned with any more cash, or whetlher teolld rais   r any more, I do not know, as I soon afer left the room and returned to Albany; but, if 8. i    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6734-00000059"/> "4    JOHN SMTII ON A CRUTCH. he was able to raise any more " spondoolix," there is little doubt that he tried it again that evening, for the more bitter lessons of this kind a man learns, the more they don't do him any good. "I will try it again till I at least win back what I have lost," is his plea. If he has been fortunate, and won, he will say: "I seem to be pretty lucky; it's worth trying again." He does, and of ten finds it is worth trying again-- to the banker.. Wiln or lose, a gambler will be a gambler. t *w   THE SAIL BOAT        115 CHAPTER    XVI. THE  jAIL   FOAT. XT day I left Albany for Rochester, vz a the New York Central Railroad. Those who have done much traveling by railroad r must have been annoyed and tormented from   time to time by the flying dust, and the smoke and cinders from the loco- motive. Every dying spark that flies from the chim- ney seems to go right for the eyes of any unhappy visage that dares to thrust itself from a car window for a breath of' fresh air or a glance at the- scenery ahead. And O, how it does   hurt! The sting of a bumblebee is joy compared with it. On this occasion I determined to adopt a plals that would enable me to thrust my  head out all the time if I  chose, and stare at the locomotive with impunity. -  Before leaving Albany, I purchased a pair of fifty- cent goggles--window glass focus-which I   wore during my journey from Albany  to Rochester (a distance  of over two hundred miles).  Hence, my eyes being secure, I paid no attention to the smoke and dust I was continually breathing; and the result was that next  morning my throat and lungs were so sore as to interfere materially with my articulation, and for some weeks I  was afflicted with a regular ,grave- ,    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6734-00000060"/> "6    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. yard courh," that I had reason to fear would merge into some permanent pulmonary affection. I got over it, though, and I also got over wearing goggles on an express train. To this day, I can not help shuddering as I contem- plate what a frightful appearance I must have pre- sented with those goggles on. A good-looking young man like myself, on a crutch, with such an immense round patch on either side of his nose, must have been a marvel to look at. I regret that I did not pro- cure a mirror, and take a look at myself while wear- ing them, for I have never had the courage to put them on since. My memory records that several passengers, with subdued smiles on their countenances, manifested the most intense interest in my welfare, and asked me what was the matter with my eyes? In reply to this impertinent question, I gave them to understand that it was an hereditary weakness of the "windows of the soul;" and intimated that the Smith family had, from time immemorial, been amateur astronomers, and had done a good deal of gazing at the moon and stars. The New York Central Railroad takes its way through the beautiful Mohawk valley. That valley is famed in history, and we read of a great many bloody scenes enacted there by the savage Mohawk tribe; but I think that now, with its green meadows, its fields of grain, its grazing sheep and cattle, its farm- houses and dairies, with PEACE smiling over all, it is far more beautiful and interesting than it was in its wildness, when the red-skinned son of nature made it   THE SAIL BOAT.       117 his home, and followed killing bears, deer, and the pale-faces for a living. There is one grand picture in the Mohawk valley which I can not forbear to mention. It is an enchant- ing cascade. The amount of water is not great, but it comes streaming down from a height of two hundred feet, sparkling in the sunbeams, and bounding from rock to rock like a thing of life. For calm, quiet enjoyment, I would rather sit among- the trees that hover about this roma'ntic cascade and listen to its murmurs, than on the banks of the Niagara, and hear the roars of that grand old cataract. It was after night-fall when we reached Rochester, and as I wanted to stay there a few days, I went into an hotel that was in the same building with the depot itself, and registered my name. Next morning I walked out and looked about me. Rochester is a very pleasant city of about sixty thousand inhabitants, and is situated at the Falls of the Genesee river, seven miles from Lake Ontario. I say at the Falls, for the city is built on all sides of the cataract, except one. It occupies either shore, and one of its principal streets, with its solid rows of buildings, actually crosses the river on an arched bridge or viaduct about two hundred yards above the Falls. It will be remembered that it was at these Falls that Samuel Patch, Esquire, made his last leap; and here I am compelled to dispel a very popular delusion that prevails in regard to the matter. I do not wish ?:- to detach a particle from the glory and honor of Mr. Patch, for he was an American, like myself-not ex- actly like myself, either, for he is said to have had ... t :::71    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6734-00000061"/> "8    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. two legs-and I feel a kind of national pride in holding him up before the world as the paragon of jumpers. But what I wish to say, is this: Patch did not stand in the water below, as is generally supposed, and jump up over the falls. On the contrary, he stood above on a platform erected at the brink of the precipice, where there was not much water pouring over at the time, and jumped down; and who couldn't do that? I saw persons in Rochester who saw him make his last leap, and they told me all about it, con- fidentially. Another thing: It is generally known that Patch leaped over the Falls of Genesee twice, but it is not generally known on which of these occasions he killed himself; some suppose it was the first: but I can assure them, on the best authority, that it was his second leap at Rochester, and not his first, that proved fatal. On one occasion Daniel Webster was called upon to speak at a public dinner given at Rochester. "Gentlemen," said he, "Athens had her Acropolis, and Rome her Coliseum, but, gentlemen, they could boast of no such falls as those of Rochester!"Here, being slightly under the influence of the wine which he had been drinking, he paused, and hesitating, was about to sit down, when some one whispered to him "The national debt!" Rising to his full height the great orator exclaimed: "And then, gentlemen, there is the National Debt! It should be paid, gentlemen. It must be paid, gentlemen." And then, in louder tones, "I'll be d--d if it shan't be paid. I'll 2pay it --sr- --r?1-swr,x-,;------.,+^  -- --  I  1 i"   JVjS d ki1A o tdLVAT'L,  119 nysel/!" pulling out his pocket-book. "How MUCH IS IT?" Two miles below Rochester there is a wharf where steamboats and other lake craft land, and where a man keeps boats to let. The street-cars run to within three quarters of a mile of the place, and I got on one and* rode down. On leaving the car at the terminus of the city railway, I walked to the river bank, and found a graded wagon-road leading down to the landing, the bank being about two hun- dred feet high; and very steep. When I reached the landing I concluded to hire a sail boat and have a little ride on the river. "Can yoo manage one?" asked the owner. "O, yas," I replied. "That is, pretty well." The truth was, I had never tried it, and therefore didn't know whether I could manage one or not. "Well, take that one," said he, pointing to a small sail boat of about three quarters of a ton burthen. "There are oars in it, and if you can not manage it you can row it back." It was well enough, for without those oars I could never have brought it back. I got in, the sail being set, and he pushed me from shore. A stiff breeze was sweeping down the river, and I did not like to run before it, lest it should blow me out upon the lake and clear over to Canada. So, I thought I would try tacking, and run up the river a little way, in order to have easy sailing back. With the helm in one hand and a line attached to the boom in the other, I went flying across the river, which was only about fours hundred feet wide, and presently brought up against I I    <pb n="120 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6734-00000062"/> 120    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. the other shore. I looked quickly around to see if the owner was observing me, found he wasn't, pushed my boat off with an oar, got the sail set right for the other tack, and went sailing for the western shore again. This time, I "tacked" in time, turned the boat pretty skillfully, and the boom - sweeping around be- fore the wind hit me a deuce of a " (elt " on the head and knocked my hat off into thel'water. I then lowered the sail and shipped the oars. Recovering my hat, I then unshipped the oars, and hoisted my sail again. I had seen persons " tack " before, and make pretty good time against a head-wind. It looked simple and easy; but with me it went rather awkwardly. I couldn't make any "time" up stream at all, but found after each "tack" that I had drifted further and further down. I had better have cast anchor and waited for a port or starboard wind, so far as makincg " time " wlas concerned. At last, much disgusted with a sail boat, I lowered my sail and toolk her in with the oars, vowing never to try a sail boat again: another vow I kept for nearly a year. I then hired a light row boat and went up to the "Lower Falls "--that is, a cataract of some seventy or eighty feet, about a mile and a half below the plrilrcipal Falls of Genesee. I had some stiff rowing to )et up, too, for the current was very swift near the Falls. But didn't I come back, though, when I started to return! I only used my oars to keep the boat straight, and the current carried me down as the wind hears a feather before it.      <pb n="-121" xml:id="VAC6734-00000063"/> (I        THE SAIL BOAT.       121 The next day was Sunday, and learning that a small steam pleasure boat was to make a trip that afternoon from the landing, to a little harbor on the lake shore, some eight or ten miles from the mbuth of the river, I went down and embarked for the voyage. The boat started early in the afternoon, crowded with pleasure-seekers. It was the slowest boat and about the lightest draft steamboat I ever had the honor to travel on. We were three or four hours reaching our destination: and on entering the harbor, she plowed through the shallowest water I ever saw navigated. The water in the lake was low at that time, and we passed over some places where the rushes grew up so thick that at a little distance the water could not be seen at all. It looked a little more like navigating a meadow than any thing I ever saw. At intervals, when we could see the water ahead of us, it did not appear to be a foot deep. And, O, the way our boat stirred the mud up! I pity the fish that lost their way in our wake: they must have been a long time finding it again. The voyage was a little tedious, in consequence of the slow "time" we made, but not unpleasant. It was nine o'clock that evening when we returned to the landing in the G6nesee river, and a two-horse spring wagon waited there for all who preferred a ten-cent ride up the long hill to a free walk. I pre- ferred the ride and got in. But I wished myself out again before we reached the upper end of the perilous road, for I never enjoyed the luxury of a more dangerous ride. It was extremely dark--so dark s  I,7    'tl    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6734-00000064"/> 122    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. that you couldn't have seen a candle, if it had not been lighted.-and the wagon was crowded. As we moved up the road there was a high perpendicular bank on our right hand, and on our left was the brink of a steep precipice, whose height became greater and greater as we advanced; and I could not help contemplating the fearful consequences of a possible accident, such as the balking of the horses, the break- ing of the traces, or the giving way of the earth at the brink of She declivity beneath the weight of the wheels. It was, in truth, a perilous ride, and before we reached the top of the tall shore half the passen- gers had got scared and jumped off: but I had paid for my ride, and was determined to have it at the risk of my neck. So I stayed in. We reached the head of the narrow road without accident, and half-an-hour later I was in my bed, re- posing after the pleasures and perils of the day.   NIAGARA FALLS.       123 CHAPTER    XVII. rIAGARA FALLS. N the following Wednesday morning I took the accommodation train for Niagara Falls. When I say (' accommodation train," do not fancy that we went jogging along at the rate of six or eight miles an hour. That is not the style of the New York Central. The accommodation trains make twenty miles an hour, including numerous stoppages, which is better time than is made by the express trains of some roads I have traveled on. So, I arrived at Niagara, eighty miles from Roches- ter, by nine o'clock; where I left my trunk at an hotel and walked out to see the sights. It would be presumptuous in any man to attempt a regular description of Niagara Falls, with the ex- pectation of doing the subject justice-much more so in the unpretendingoJohn Smith. No one can form a fair idea of the mighty cataract without hayving seen it. Nor will one mere glance be sufficient. You may spend whole days there before you arrive at a just appreciation of it. The mind cannot grasp it at once. A friend had told me that I should, on first visiting Niagara, experience a sense of disappointment-that    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6734-00000065"/> 124    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. the Falls would not appear quite equal to their repu- tation and my consequent anticipations; but that, by and by, as I should come to contemplate them more maturely, I should be led to regard them as infinitely grander and more majestic, than my loftiest anticipa- tions had painted them. I found it true. As the train approached, I heard the roar of the cataract, and saw the green waters tumbling down with their white robes of spray; but I somehow thought they did not come up to my expectations, or rather ex- perienced a vague, indescribable impression that I had seen the like before. But when I walked down to the bank, stood in the midst of the mighty thunder, felt the earth tremble beneath the giant leap of the great river, saw the dashing spray, arising like clouds of smoke and dust from the sudden ruin of some great city; when I remembered that for ages and ages, from time lost in dim obscurity, day and night, winter and summer, never ceasing, never tiring, the mighty waters had been tumbling and plunging down from the dizzy height, as now; and when I thought of the future, when I mused of the unknown ages to come, fancied generation after generation to have passed away; when I imagined this great round sphere to have made thousands of annual revolutions around the sun, and pictured the grand old cataract, with none of its vigor lost in the maze of centuries, still thundering away, with the same old strength, young, mighty, glorious, majestic as ever: then did I begin to realize the magnitude of the lofty cataract, the work of the Almighty Maker of heaven and earth, and feel the littleness, the nothingness, of man!   NIAGARA FALLS.         125 The following lines written in the immediate pres- ence of the great cataract, by David Paul Brown, Jr., Esquire, of the Philadelphia Bar, are highly worthy of perusal: "Niagara I O, Niagara! long thy memory will remain A source of mingled wonder, of happiness and pain. When burst thine awful grandeur on my raptured, ravished sight, My senses broke from Reason's chain, in frenzied, wild delight; But as the God-like attribute resuined its sovereign sway, A calmer feeling soothed my breast-its tumult passed away, The spirit bowed, and then a tear-my Nature was subdued, A thrill of awe swept through my frame, I worshiped as I viewed; A moment more I silent gazed, then humbly bent the knee, As, in Niagara's mightiness, I felt God's majesty! I saw His glory shining round where tremblingly I stood, I cast a glance to His bright realm then on the foaming flood: And is there strength, I humbly asked, in the Almighty will To calm this boisterous element, and bid its rage be still?- To sweep it e'en from Nature's fage, With but a single breath, Resistlessly as human life is swept away ly death? And can Niagara not rebel, with all its force and power, When crumbling Nature shall give way at the appointed hour? Must its fierce torrent tamely hush-its giant rocks then fall? The still voice of my soul replied, 'Yes, yes, frail mortal, all!' Then let me meekly bow the head before such Power Divine- The only Power that never ends-NIAGARA's GOD AND MNE!" I am  sure you will not quarrel with me, reader, for introducing these graphic and eloquent lines, and for growing sentimental over my remembrance of Niagara Falls.   They are too grand to be passed over lightly. Thus far, since my arrival at Niagara, you have not found much of the John Smithian tone in s   my narrative.    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6734-00000066"/> 126    JOH1 SMITH ON A. CRUTCH. I had heard a good deal about the "Cave of the AWinds," and thought I would like to visit it. So, after standing for a full hour, wrapped up in the glories of the thundering cataract, I inquired of a respectable-looking gentleman where the "Cave of he Winds" was? ' You must go over on Goat Island to see that," he said; "but I hope you don't think of going down? "O, yes," I replied. "What--on one leg?" "Yes, I shall certainly take it with me." "But it is dangerous. You will have to go down a steep flight of wooden steps, and pass behind the sheet of water where you cannot stand up. The spray will blind you, and the wind will take your breath and lift you off your feet--" "Foot,' I interrupted. "Yes, will lift you off yourfoot; and one mis-step is certain death. Many strong men with two legs are afraid to try it." "They have two feet. and are therefore just twice as apt to slip or make a mis-step." "Well," said he, "go and see it, and I don't believe you will venture down. A look down into it will satisfy you. It will remind you of all the accounts you have heard of Hades---" "Where I thought water was not so plenty," I in- terrupted. 'You are ahead of me again," said he, laughing. "Vell, follow the bank of the river till you reach a bridge: that will take you over to Goat Island." "' Thank you."   NIAGARA FALLS.       127 I walked up the shore of the river a little way and came to the bridge-a suspension bridge of four or five spans-and went over to Goat Island. This is- land divides the turbulent river, just. before it takes its fearful plunge, into two cataracts. That on this side is termed the "American Fall;" that between Goat Island and Canada being termed the "Horse- shoe Fall," because of its shape. The American Fall is nine hundred feet wide and one hundred and sixty- four feet high; while the Horse-shoe Fall is two thousand feet wide and one hundred and fifty-eight feet high. By far the larger portion ojfthe water tumbles over on the Canada side of the island, no doubt because the rocky bed of the river is six feet lower on that side; the cataract on either side, how- ever, is stupendous enough for all practical purposes. In this connection I am reminded of an anecdote, with which I iwill conclude this chapter. Two Yankees, one of a sentimental and the other of a practical turn of mind, were standing side by side, gazing on this prodigy of Nature. "How sublime!" exclaimed the former. "To think that it falls one hundred and sixty-four feet at a sin. gle leap 1" "What's to hinder it?" responded the other.    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6734-00000067"/> 128    JOHN S3ITHe ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER    XV111. AVE OF THE WINDS. TN order to reach the "Cave of the Winds "-I don't see why it should be so styled, for the winds never uaved there yet--I had to descend a winding stairway within a wooden tower at the north-western margin of the island. On arriving at the base of the tower, I found myself on a shelf about forty feet above the water-line below the Falls, with the Ameri- can Fall on my right hand and the Horse-shoe Fall on my left. The "Cave of the Winds" is simply a vacant space between the great perpendicular wall of rock over which the torrent leaps, on the American side, and the broad sheet of descending water itself. A flight of wooden steps takes the visitor down nearly to the water level, behind the foaming, dashing folds of this fearful curtain; and from the foot of the stairs a narrow plank walk extends some distance, to a point where the sheet of water is again parted by a project- ing rock at the brink far above. The visitor, after reaching this welcome recess in the furious torrent, can pass out and take a seat on a great heap of rocks at the foot of the mighty cataract, where he hears nothing but the eternal thunder of waters and a cloud of mist hides the whole world from his view!   CAVE OF TIIE WINDS.      129 Pardon me for coming down from the sublime to the common-place, and for stating that a suit of water- proof clothes is provided for the visitor. At a little house near the entrance to the "Cave of the Winds "I met a man whom I asked where the guide was. "I am one of the guides," said he: " but you, don't want to go down into the Cave of the Winds?" "Yes, I had rather thought of going down," I re- plied. "O, dear me!" he said, decidedly. "You can't go down!" "Why?"I asked. "I wouldn't let you go down for a thousand dol- lars! you would be drowned, certain. Just step this way and take a look down.-Did you lose your leg in the army?" "Yes," I replied, as we walked to the head of the wooden stairway, "at the battle of Antietam, in Meade's Division, Hooker's Corps-got struck with a rifle-ball, and the leg was amputated the 'same 'day about six hours after; I draw a pension of eight dol- lars a month, but can't wear an artificial leg on ac- count of the shortness of the stump; I  am never *troubled by change of weather-nam twenty-two years old and my name is John Smith.-That place down there is the Cave of the Winds: is it?--Well, it's a much milder-looking place than I had expected to find it."

"-What do you think of it'?" he asked, in a loud voice, so as to be heard above the roar of the cataract "A fine place," I coolly shouted. "Wrouldn't think of going down, now, I hope?" "I'll go down now, by all means," I calmly yelled. O, no; it would be recklessness," he shouted. "We've never lost any one here yet, and we don't want to." He didn't want me " lost." "No danger," I shrieked. "I can't give my consent," he yelled, decidedly. "If you don't," I screamed, "I'll jump down without it. I've traveled eighteen hundred miles for the sole purpose of goincg down in the Cave of the Windls, and I'll not return to my free home in the lckly Mountains without it! Give me a water- proof suit!" That began to tell on him. A man who lived in a free honme among the Rooky Mountains might be dangerous. So he yelled, in a softer tone: "Well, if you will only go to the foot of the stairs, and will not try to follow-the walk to that heap of stones out there, I'll give you the water-proof clothes, and you may go down." "John Slmith never rejected any thing like a rea- sonable compromise," I replied; "so I will promise to go no further than the foot of the steps. Get me the water-proofs."

As I began to descend, I felt as though I was leaving the face of the earthy for ever; but who can describe my emotions as I stood at the very heels of the raving and raging cataract? Who shall describe that awful place? It exceeded all the wild storms I had ever dreamed of. The spray dashed into my face, and fairly blinded me; while the fierce, unceasing wind' rushed violently upon me from all sides, took the very breath 'from me, and seemed about to snatch me up from the frail plank on which I stood, and hurl me under the mighty torrent! It was wildly, fearfully bewildering. The wind and spray and the roar of the cataract fairly took away from me the senses of sight and hearing; I was con- scious that the water had thrust its way beneath my water-proof clothes, and that I was wet all over, but could not fepl the dampness; I could scarcely corm- mand my mind so as to think or reason. I scarcely knew whether I felt, thought, or was conscious at all, so absorbed were all my faculties in that eternal storm. I fancy that, if one were to remain there long, he would lose all consciousness, sink prostrate, tumble from the walk, plunge under the wild torrent, and be no more. On returning to the face of the earth again, and re- moving my water-proof clothes, I realized how wet I i?  was. I fancied it would not help my cough very much, but although I got wringing wet four different times during the few days of my sojourn at Niagara, it never injured me: which is a strong point in fav;or      * - i     <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6734-00000069"/> 132    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. of the water-cure system; i. e., if it don't cure, it, at least, is not quite certain to kill. "What is your charge?"I asked of the proprietor. "Nothing at all," was the reply. "We charge visitors two dollars each when we attend them through the whole walk; but, under the circumstances, we won't charge you any thing." "I am willing to pay, if-" "No, no; not a cent. If any one ought to pay, I ought to pay you ten dollars for the privilege of seeing you go down there. You are the first and only one-leggced man that ever ventured into the Cave of the Winds." I returned to my hotel, took a lemonade, changed my clothes, imbibed another lemonade, took dinner, then another lemonade, and was about to start for the river again, when the host said: "Are you going to see Leslie walk the rope?" "Walk the rope? Where?" I queried. "Just below the railroad bridge-the large sus- pension bridge, two miles below." "At what time?" "Four o'clock. You will have an hour or two yet to get there." "I will go, by all means," I said, much delighted at this opportunity. "I thank you for mentioning it." I went out, and walked leisurely down to the Sus-' pension Bridge. I found a great many people col- lected on the bridge, and on either shore, and ob- served that there was a rope stretched across from bank to bank, not far from the bridge.   ,5-: .    CAVE OF THE WINDS.      133 This bridge is one of the grandest of structures. It is an iron bridge with a single span of eight hundred feet, and is suspended two hundred and fifty feet above the water. The trains run over on top of it, while on a level with the bank are a carriage-way and a walk for pedestrians. I paid twenty-five cents to be admitted upon the bridge, in order to view the feats of Mr. Leslie. It was crowded with spectators, but I succeeded in get- ting a good position, from which I could see the rope. Not long after, Mr. Leslie, arrayed in the garb of a circus actor, and carrying a long pole in his hands, as a man is apt to carry a fence-rail when constructing a worm fence, made his appearance on the American shore, stepped boldly out upon the rope, over the fearful abyss, and walked leisurely toward Canada. He moved nimbly till he had traveled more than half the length of the rope, when he seemed to lose his confidence for awhile, stopped, and tottered from side to side. At this point, the ladies all became pale, a great many of them said, "O, Lord!" fervently, and turned away; while we stronger-hearted men gazed on with the most absorbing interest and anxiety. Leslie soon regained his composure and equilibrium, and resumed his perilous walk. t;!   On reaching the Canada side, he was saluted with thunders of applause from both shores and the bridge; and, after resting awhile, and taking a glass of lemon- ade (probably), he again stepped upon the rope, ; balancing-pole in hand, and a coffee-sack over his head. He thus again accomplished the fearful walk, and was again greeted with cheers. Then he went    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6734-00000070"/> 134    JOIN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. out upon the rope, with only the balancing-pole, stopped about the middle, and performed some gym- nastic feats. He laid his pole carefully down-one end resting on the main rope, and the other on one of the guys-hung there by his hands a moment, two hundred and fifty feet above the foaming waters, that were still angry from their recent leap, then hung suspended by one hand, then by his chin, then by his feet, and finally by one foot. To use the very mildest expression, it looked dangerous. His hanging suspended by one foot was his last feat for that day; the crowd soon after dispersed, and I got into an omnibus and returned to Niagara.   --:mu^       CANADA.         15 C HAPTE R   X IX. CANADA. D ARLY next morning I Started for Canada, Just below the Falls a flight of three hundred steps, protected by a weather-boarded frame-work andi roof, descends the steep bank to the water's edge, and beside the flight of steps is a track for small cars, that are drawn up and let down by means of a windlass run by water-power. I got on one of the cars and( rode down to the water;- but before taking the boat for Canada, visited the foot of the'Falls near by, and got completely wet with spray again. Here the wind created by the vast masses of water continually tum- bling down is very strong, and the flying spray is equal to a violent rain; so that this place reminded me of the "Cave of the Winds." I had to climb -   over a huge heap of slippery rocks that had at one time fallen from above, and I got my shin scraped u and bruised, and my knee cut in the operation. O, what difficulties a mortal will overcome for the sake :'i:  of novelty. Charles Dickens thus speaks of this place in his "American Notes:" g "Climbing over some broken rocks, deafened by the noise, half-blinded by the spray, and wet to tile 1 -Sin, we were at the foot of the American Fall.

After getting as wet as I wanted, I (John Smith,) returned to the foot of the stairway and got aboard the ferry-boat. This is only a kind of yawl that will accommodate twenty or twenty-five passengers, and is rowed across the turbulent stream by one strong man. It was crowded with visitors, of both sexes and all ages; and when we reached the middle of the stream, where the waves were rolling, and the boat rocked handsomely, a lady grew dizzy and pale, dropped her parasol in the water, fainted, and fell back in the boat, into the arms of a friend. I seized the parasol before it could float away, sprinkled a little of the sparkling water upon her face, and' she revived.. ve soon after reached the Canada shore and she was all right again, When we landed, the passengers all arose from their seats in the crowded boat, and made a rush to see who should be first ashore, just as though the first would see the most. The result was that one fell overboard, and another, in making a leap from the gunwale of the boat, miscalculated the distance, ancl alighted in water of such a depth that it just ran into his watch-pocket to see what time it was. Both were rescued, completely saturated, and terribly scared. I quietly retained my seat in the boat till the rush was over. As I stepped ashore, last of all, the boatman, whom I shall always remember gratefully for his kindness, slyly said to me:   e--     .

Do not buy any thing or hire a carriage without first making your bargain, or you will be charged six prices." I thanked him, and treasured up his advice. 1: 1On the Canada side, a carriage-road winds its way ::  in a serpentine course up the steep, high shore; and, on stepping from the boat I was immediately assailed by half-a-dozen drivers of carriages, who expressed a curiosity to know whether I desired to ride up or not. But I replied that I lived " just over the hill," and would walk up. One of them. winked at the other, and I passed on. On gaining the top of the high shore, I visited Table Rock, from which prominent point I had an excellent view of the whole cataract. I was again assailed by cabmen. "Do you want to go to Lundy's Lane?" "Do you want to go to the Burning Springs?" "Do you want to go to the Suspension Bridge?" "Do you want to go to Brock's Monument?"I was asked in a second. "- Yes, but I'm going to walk," I replied. "Walk! You can't! It's four miles to Lundy's Lane." [It's only a little over a mile, reader. J. Smith.] "It's five miles to the Burning Springs." [It's only one and a half. J. Smith.] "It's ten miles to Brock's Monument." [It's only five or six. J. Smith.] "It's three and ,a half to the Bridge.." [It's only two J. Smith.] "Is that all? Then I'll walk, certainly." They left me--having probably come to the con- clusion that I was a heathen.    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6734-00000072"/> 138    JOHN SMNITII ON A CRUTCH. I was told that there was a place on the Canada side similar to the "Cave of the Winds," where one could go behind the sheet of water. Desiring to see all that was to be seen, I went into an adjacent build- ing, in which was a museum, got a water-proof suit, and, with others, explored this dangerous place. It is a fact worthy of remark, that the Canadian in charge of the place, did not offer a single ob- jection to my venturing upon the perilous walk; nor did he offer a single objection to accepting the fee of two dollars. Why? 'Cause I was a "Yankee." We walked fifty feet behind the sheet of water, on a narrow and slippery path. The wind and spray here, as in the "Cave of the Winds," formed a perfect tempest. It is really surprising that so few'accidents happen at this place. Many ladies visit it. 1 believe only one person ever fell from the path, and that was a gentleman. He lost his footing, rolled down a steep and slippery declivity, fell under the resistless torrent, and, of course, never breathed again. Having returned to the building and removed my water-proof clothes, I went into the museum awhile, where I saw a mummy, a native of Egypt, that had reached the remarkable age of three thousand years, and there wasn't a gray hair in his head. He had a healthy  and vigorous appearance, and looked as though by being careful about his diet, and avoiding damp weather, he might live a thousand years yet. I also saw the skeleton of a mammoth tihat had been disc,ovcred at the bottom of an oil-well. It was chiefly made of the best seasoned oak timber, and   f        :. @.d:CANADA.     -    189 colnstructed with an eye to strength and beauty com- bined. On leaving the building, I saw a very black seven- teen-year old negro sitting lazily in a buggy, and I approached him and asked: "What will you charge to drive to Lundy's Lane?"9 "Why," he replied after regarding me attentively for a moment, " dey charges six dol----" ' O, never mind," I interrupted. "I'll walk it!" And I turned away. "No, no; wait a minute," he said, quickly; and I stopped to learn what he might have the honor to represent. "Dey charges six dollahs,"- said he, " but you git in an' I'1 take you dar an' to de Burnin' Springs bofe, fur dat. Did you want to go any oder whar?" "Don't know," said I. "But come, I'll tell you what I'll do. I may want to visit several places, or may only go to Lundy's Lane. Now, I'll give you a dollar an hour for the time we're gone." "O, dat's too--" "Very well," I interrupted, walking away. "Hold on! Wait!" he called, excitedly. "Let's see. Well, don' car. May be I kin afford it. Git in.-Or, I'll help you." He was going to get out to help me in, but I placed one hand on the buggy and the other on the top of my crutch, and sprung up upon the seat with ease. "Golly!" he exclaimed. "You kill git up better'n alnoder man 1" "Certainly, old coon," I replied. "You awkward two-legged fellows can't get about in the world.-..    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6734-00000073"/> "O    JOHN SMTTI ON A CRUTCH. Drive on: don't waste my time. Let me see--"I looked at my watch--" it is just ten o'clock." "Whar'll I go de fustest?" "To Lundy's Lane. Move it, now." My ebony companion touched up his horse, and we got over the ground pretty fast. He might have jogged along slowly, to extend the time, as he was paid by the hour; but he saw I was up to-all that, and it wouldn't do. On the old battle ground of Lundy's Lane, there is a wooden tower fifty or sixty feet high, from the top of which one can see not only all the ground on which the battle was fought, but also a vast expanse of country on both sides of the river, including the vicinity of the Falls, and also many miles of the river, its mouth and a portion of Lake Ontario. The tower is ascended by means of a winding stair- way; and a surly old cove, who pretends that he was in the battle of Lundy's Lane-but I'll bet my hat he wasn't-stays there and acts as guide. He accom- panied me to the top of the tower, and showed me a telescope supported on a pivot. With this I pro- ceeded to sweep the wide, wide landscape before me, and I began to ask the old " soldier " a few questions. He was very reticent, and his answers were not only very brief, but also very vague, ambiguous, and un- satisfactory. I soon discovered why. His tongue had to be greased with a trifle of change-for he was only employed by the owner of the tower, who kept a drinlking-saloon at the bottom-that is, the base-meant. "Is that Brock's Monument?"I queried, perceiving   XH *        CANADA.         141 a tall column of masonry in the direction of Lake Ontario. "A-hem,9' he replied, reluctantly, and with an apparent difficulty of articulation--"H-it bothers my head to talk much, ever since I got my wound in this battle. That is Brock's--A-hem- HVisitors usually gives me--a-a-they generally-a little-a -a-ahem--" "O, to be sure," said I. "It's perfectly right they should not forget your services." I gave him a quarter, and found his speech much improved. Still, it was not so fluent as I could have desired, and I further touched it up in this way:. "Do you ever drink any thing?" "Yes, sometimes," he replied, distinctly, brighten- ing up. "The gentleman below keeps something, does he not?" "Yes, I believe he-Yes, he keeps a little on hand." "Then," said I, " we will take a little of a good article when we go down. It al'ways does me good to take a little something strengthening that way with an old soldier--especially one who, like yotr- self, has that graceful military air that can leave no doubt of his having served his country with distinc- tion." This was certainly piling it on pretty strong, but not too much so, it seemed, for he took it all with as good a grace as a toper would take his "bitters" in the morning. He grew extremely affable, and gave me all the information I wanted; and more, too, for I    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6734-00000074"/> "2    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. am satisfied he made up about thirty-nine or forty lies and told me-among which was this one: That he was captured at Lundy's Lane and taken before General (then ColoneD Winfield Scott-whom he pronounced the noblest soldier that ever lived-and that the latter gave him a drink of most excellent rum, and said to him: "You have an air of greatness about you--you have. Are you not a British general in disguise?" The veteran guide also told me that Buffalo was clearly visible through the telescope, and tried to point it out to me. I will not deny the fact that it was visible from the tower, but I couldn't " see it." When we went below, I treated him, as I had promised, tasting something myself; then I asked the proprietor what was to pay for drinks and visiting the tower? He let me off for a dollar. Returning to my sable fiiend in the buggy, I got in again and told him to drive to the Burning Springs, "as fast as the law would allow him;" and in less than half-an-hour we were there. The water of these springs is characterized by an" accompaniment of inflammable gas--sulphuretted hy- drooen, I think-and when a lighted match is ap- plied to it a blue flame springs up over the surface, like the flames of burning spirits. I returned to the Falls and found that we had been gone a little over two hours and a half. I then gave the darkey three dollars, and told him to drive me down to the river; which he cheerfully did. The ferry-boat was just leaving, as I jumped from   ,Ill         CXC CANADA.       143 the vehicle, but the boatman saw me, and began to push back. To reach the boat, I hat to step over some stationary rocks that protruded from the water, and in attempting to step from one of them to the boat, I slipped, lost my footing, and down I went into the river, striking my chin on the sharp edge of the rock, as I descended, and cutting it to the bone. I went in up to my neck, and would have gone lower still had I not clung to the rock. I scrambled up into the boat, with some assistance, and the boatman recovered my crutch and cane that were floating on the water.  The gash on my chin healed up in a few weeks, but it left a scar that will be unpleasant ground for my barber to get over as long as I live. A couple of days later, having visited all the points of interest in the vicinity of Niagara, I departed for Buffalo, a city at the head of the Niagara river, twenty-two miles from the Falls. I did not leave however, without regret: I fancied I could never grow tired of Niagara Falls. The great cataract, whose youth, and vigor, and might are the same they were a thousand years ago, could never grow old to me!    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6734-00000075"/> "4    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER    XX. FOLONEL JOHN )SMITH AT AN HOTEL. LOCATED in a delightful place called "Cold Spring," in. the suburbs of Buffailo, and there re- mained two weeks; during which time I recovered fronm my cough, and the gash on my chin healed up. I made some pleasing acquaintances at Cold Spring, and became as much attached to the beautiful locality as though I had lived there for years. From Buffalo I went to Erie, Pennsylvania; thence, to Cleveland, Ohio, a beautiful city of about forty- five thousand inhabitants, situated on the shore of Lake Erie. As I desired to remain at Cleveland a week or so, I took lodgings at an hotel about two or three miles fromn the city, near the terminus of the City tRailway, where the air was clear and pure and the green fields lay spread out around me; and yet where I could jumnp on a street-car and ride into the heart of the city in twenty-five or thirty minutes. While at this hotel, a little incident happened to me, which some might term " funny"--but I did not think it so at the time, because it was rather calcula- ted to wound my pride and dignity--and which further illustrates the mortification to which an un-   CH:I!';  COLONEL JOHN S5MTH .T AN IIOTEL.  145 ?;:': happy one-legged .fellow  is sometimes subjected, ["  tlhrough the pardonable ignorance  or want of * judgment of othcrs. I was sitting on the piazza of t the hotel one delightful evening in September en- joying the mild balmyr air and admiring the glow- ing sunset, when two charming young ladies, in a buggy, drove up to the pump in front of the hotel, obviously with the intention of quenching their deli- cate thirst by quaffing the pure, sparkling water. One was about to jump out for the purpose .of getting the water for herself and her companion. No one else was near. Could I sit there and see the beautiful creature climb out for a draught of the water, when it was in my power to help them both to it where they sat, and thus save them the trouble? Not while my name was John Smith-and thus far the Legislature of my State had not been petitioned to change it. "Do not get out, miss," I said, rising, takinig up my crutch, and walking to the pump. "Do not get out: I will hand you a drink.--Fine evening." "Yes, very.--But, I am afraid it's too much tr-" "O, not at all," said I, taking the pump-handle in one hand, and with the other holding the tin cup that was at the pump under the spout. "Pray remain where you are." "You are so kind--" "O, not at all," I interrupted, as the sparkling water gushed from the spout and overflowed the cup. I handed the cup to the nearest fair one, and she handed it to her companion. "You drink," said her companion. "O no; you," said the fair one nearest mne.     <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6734-00000076"/> "6    JOHN SAITsT ON A CRUTCHL "N; o you drink first," said the other." "I won't: you mutst drink first."' So, the one farthest iron mne took the cup and drank. I describe this little episode in the incident, because I sulppose it to be a scene entirely new, and one that Ino person ever saw any thing like before (?). When the lovely one on the other side had drank, the lovely one on my side took the cup, which was yet half full, drank it off and handed me the vessel, with a sweet; "Thank you." "Will you have some more 7" "No, thank you." "Perhaps, the other lady----' 'It will be seen that I was getting extremely gallant. "No, thank you; no more," interrupted the other lady.

But here comes the mortifying part. One of the ladies held out her hand. Was she going to shake hands with me and bid me an affectionate farewell? No. My brain reeled, as I looked closer at the hand. "Here, please take it," said she. Take----not the hand, but a ten-cent note which she held out and desired me to "take" in return for my distinguished services. I felt the hot blood rush to my cheeks, but mastering my emotion, I said: "O, no, miss, I thank you, indeed. I am not the porter here now. I used to be, but my Uncle Charles ^ Exeter Johnson Smith died two days before last Christmas a year ago, and left me a large fortune; since which time, I have only been a boarder here. I thank you.  Good evening." And  I turned and walked away, while they drove slowly toward the city. I can only impute the young lady's conduct to theo grossest ignorance. I was not miserably clad, or any thing of that sort, and her reason for offering me the little contribution could only have been that I had lost a leg, and she no doubt thought it naturally fol- lowed that I was "needy." A  great mistake. The -/"i wealthiest man in the world would have lost his leg had he been standing where I was when I was shot. -Having spent a week at Cleveland, I departed for the smoky city of Pittsburg; where I  arrived one    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6734-00000077"/> "8    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. evening at five o'clock. Before returning to Philadel- phia, I desired to visit the celebrated "White Rocks," near Uniontown, about seventy miles south of Pitts- burg; and as no train was to leave for Uniontown till next morning, I was obliged to remain in Pittsburg all night-a thing I never do if I can help it, because I never spent a comfortable night in the smoky old place: nor do I believe any other civilized person ever did. Before the train reached Pittsburg, I had given orders to a baggage-expressman to send my trunk to the St. Charles hotel, which had once been a first-class house, but which, without, my knowledge, had of late degenerated to some extent. At the depot I got into a " bus" and rode to the St. Charles; when I saw at a glance that it had changed proprietors and was not conducted as of yore. It was in the hands of two or three brothers who were lineal descendants of the patriarch Abraham.  One of theim was acting as clerk. He was blustering about the office, like a rat that had got into a hot brick-kiln and couldn't find its way out, giving orders to the porter, talking to several guests at once, and getting very little accom- plished. "Can I get a single room, to-night?"I asked. "I ton't knows," he said, in the odious dialect of a Teutonic Jacobite, "I sees apout it pretty soons direcklies leetle whiles;" and he kept on talking with some body about nothing. 1 stood by the counter for some minutes, entirely unnoticed by the contemptible fellow; and beginning   COLONEL JOITN SMTTH AT AN IOTET.  149 to think that ' pretty soons direcklies leetle whiles" had about expired, I said: "My friend, my trunk will be here presently, and I would like to know if you can accommodate me with a room." "In vun meenutes," he said. "We's some fulls now, don't knows." Had I not already ordered my trunk to this hotel, I would not have trifled there many seconds, but would have gone at once to another house. Wonder- ing why he seemed so inattentive to me, I glanced at my apparel and was thereby reminded that I was not well dressed. I seldom wear good clothes during a journey of several hundred miles in a railroad car, for the smoke and dust will ruin a good suit of clothes in half that distance. I had on, for one thing, a mili- tary coat which I had worn considerably, and it immediately suggested an idea to me. I opened the register, with a commanding and dignified air, put on expressly for the occasion, took up a pen, examined it, found it very good, but dashed it impatiently down, as though not quite good enough for me, then took up another, found it good enough, dipped it savagely into the ink, and wrote: "JOHN SMITH, COLONEL U. S. A., NEW YORK." "There is my name," said I, turning the book around, and pointing to what I had written. "Try to hunt up a single room for me, and put my trunk in it when it comes. My name is on it. There is my check for it. I am going out awhile." And I gave him the check of the baggage-express agent.    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6734-00000078"/> 150    JOHNT SMTII ON A CRUTCH. The disgusting groveler glanced at my name, and fairly jumped from the floor: he was all obsequious- ness in a moment. "Certainly, Colonels," he exclaimed, and I fancied he would have embraced me if the counter had not been between us, "I tends to it right aways." And he immediately wrote the number of a room opposite my name.  "Porters, see eef Colonels Schmidt's drunks comes yet aready now. Yen it ish comes put it in Numbers Finf. We sees to it, Colonels. You says you goes out? Vel], you have suppers any times vat you vants it." All eyes were turned on me. Those present must have thought me a rather young-looking colonel. I have no doubt that a great many went to the register and examined my signature, after my back was turned. They were no doubt proud of the honor, too. I walked out, and had just descended the steps of the hotel, when I ran against a young man who had a cane in his hand and walked a little lame. "Excuse me," I said. "No harm done- " he began, then opened his eyes wide with surprise and interrupted himself Iwith, "Why,' John Smith! this you?" It was "Chris"Miller, whom. I had known at IIaddington Hospital, and he was walking on his artificial leg. "Hollo! Miller, my boy! How do you do?"I exclaimed, as we shook hands. "Fine," he said. "Do you live here?"   COLONEL JOHN SMITH AT AN HOTEL.    151 Yes-or rather, in Alleghany City." "I am glad we have met. I stay at the St. Charles to-night. I hope you are not engaged." * No." "Then you must take supper with me. Come up a moment; then we will take a walk." I re-entered the hotel, accompanied by Miller, and opening the register again with the air of the owner, I wrote immediately under my name: "MAJOR C. MLLER, PITTSBURG ARSENAL." ' Rajor Miller," said I, addressing the clerk, " will take supper with me." "All right, Colonels," was the obsequious reply; 6 any times you blease." Miller and I walked out for a stroll, and I explained to him, somewhat to his amusement, my reason for adopting those high-sounding military titles. We then stopped at the first respectable saloon, and took a hearty lemonade, with a powerful " stick" in it- dispensing with the lemons, water and sugar. We soon returned, and, after supper at the hotel, walked out for another stroll about the city. At ten o'clock we parted, and I returned to the hotel, ready to retire. "(Colonels," said the clerk, "you drunks comes. ' We puts him in ze rooms for you." ";Very well; I will retire," I said. c See thlat I am awakened in time for the seven-o'clock train for Uniontown."

He went with me to a double-bedded room on the  first floor, where I founld my trunk, (with a fresh dent in it,) and lighting the gas for me, and leaving the key inl the door, he bade me a humble good night, as, with a cringing bow, he retired from my military presence. It was after one o'clock before the mosquitoes con- sented to my going asleep, and I had not been asleep long', when thump, thump, knock, knock, krock, went some one at my door, breaking upon my slum- bers most unpleasantly. They wanted to put another man in my room, and, as I did not concur in the arrangement, I lay still and let them pound at the door till their knuckles were sore. At last I heard some one say: "There's no Avaking that fellow." Presently a hurried footstep approached, and the well-known voice of the clerk who had assigned me my room, exclaimed excitedly: "Vat you does dere? Dat's de Colonels! Mein Gott!" And I was left in peaceable and untrammeled possession of the room. I was awakened in due time in the morning; and, putting my rusty-looking clothes into my trunk and donning a more respectable suit, I came down to bretakfast, and received such marked attention that I began to fancy myself a major-general, instead of a mere colonel. Immediately after breakfast, I paid my bill-($5.25)-found a carriage awaiting me at   ' the door; and, having been bidden an affectionate o ['   COLONEL JOHN SMITH AT AN HOTEL.   13  adieu by the proprietors, three or four times, I rode to the depot. I have not recorded this incident for the purpose of injuring the St. Charles Hotel; as it has since changed proprietors, and is now conducted in a creditable manner. If you want to get along smoothly and comfortably while traveling, do not fail to make the clerks and proprietors of hotels believe you are something more than mortal: if you don't, you will find rough sailing.  j A very good plan is to knock down a porter or waiter now and then, by way of preserving your dignity. You will find it profitable. Also, threaten to shoot the proprietor, occasionally, when you have a shadow of a pretext: that will never fail to establish your importance.

CHAPTER    XXI. COURTESIES OF TRAVELEdS. FTER a ramble through the wild mountainous region of southwestern Pennsylvania, I re- turned to Philadelphia; and soon afterward started for Washington, to remain there a few weeks in the capacity of correspondent. When I travel in a railroad car, I always prefer that end of the seat next to the window. My reasons for this are various. For one thing a person can get a little fresh air, when he wanits it-and too much when he don't want it-he can get a far better view of the scenery without; and, besides, he can keep a look-out ahead for collisions, and jump out head fore- most, if he sees another train coming from the oppo- site direction on the same track. Influenced by these considerations, I always manage to get to the depot a full half-hour before the starting-time of the train, and this course never fails to secure me my favorite end of the seat.  On this occasion, I was at the depot at Broad and Prime streets, in good time, and had no difficulty in i locating myself on the train to my perfect satisfaction.  AWhen the car was nearly full of passengers, and it  was within two minutes of the time for starting, a - at/:;   COURTESIES OF TRAVELERS.     155 lady and gentleman came in, and began to canvass the interior in search of a wholly vacant seat that they might both occupy; but their search proved futile. Quite a number of the seats were occupied by but one passenger, each, but there was not one entirely vacant. Failing to find an empty seat, the gentleman concluded he would make one empty, and he there-  fore came to me, and said:  "Young man, won't you take a seat with another  gentleman and give us this seat?"  "Very cheerfully," I replied, "if the other gentle- man will allow me to sit by the window." . He regarded this as equivalent to a refisal, and became vexed. "But," he said, rather petulantly, " don't you see I have my lady with me?"  - Until he said this, I had supposed her to be his  wnable. wili "My friend," I returned, "I came to the station  early for the express purpose of obtaining a Comforta- ble -seat, and I do not think it right that I should keep  it this long, and then give it up to another. I there- fore respectfully decline to relinquish my seat."  'I hope," said he, fairly grinding his teeth withi anger and vexation, "that you will some day be traveling with a lady, and-- " "I hope so," I interrupted; "but I fear I will never be so fortunate." "Well," he rejoined changing his tactics, "I will see the conductor, and see if hie don't make the arrangement for me." "Very well," I retorted; "see the conductor.

That con- ductor would be a living wonder. Barnum would pay handsomely for him." "Young man," put in a gentleman behind me, who was also occupying a seat alone, " why don't you give them the seat? You can sit by me."' "Why don't youa "I retorted. "You can sit by me." "I like to sit by the window," he responded; " and am not well." "I, too, am partial to the window,"r  said I; " and have been at the point of death for a long time, with the toothache and a bad cold. I am quite an invalid. --ow, my friend," I went on, addressing the gentle- man with his lacly, " why did you come to me, the first one. and ask me to move, when you see that I am a cripple? There are others in the car who occupy whole seats, and who could certainly move more easily than I. Were I the only one, I would willingly resign my seat, for the accommodation of the lady." "*I think you shouldn't ask him to move," said a gentlenman who sat with another on an opposite seat.

Man is naturally a selfish crea- ture, and nowhere is his selfishness brought out in so strong a light as on a railroad car. Do not censure me, gentle public, for not relinquishing my seat. This was not the first or last time I was asked to abandon a comfortable seat in a car, after taking the trouble to go early-and secure it. It seems that in such cases, they always colne right to me. I do not know why. It may be that I look young, innocent and verdant; and that they jump to the conclusion that I am one of those persons who, as the poet doesn't say:                        X "Know not their rights;          And, knowing lnot, dare not maintain." When I saw the two unfortunates about to leave  the car, I called them back. "Come," I said; "you can have my seat. I can- not see a lady in a dilemma, when I can relieve her by making so slight a sacrifice." And I arose, seized my crutch and was about to walk out from between the seats.                       .  : "No, no," said the gentleman who occupied the seat behind me, and whose better nature began to showr itself, while, at the same time a dozen others arose, ready to give up their seats. "No, you musn't    i move. You're crippled, and I am not. They can        A take my seat." And he jumped up, with an agility that one could scarcely expect to see displayed by an invalid, and took a seat beside me; while the /gentle- man and his lady returned, and took possession of the vacated seat, without a single expression of thanks.    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6734-00000082"/> 158    JOHN SMTII ON A CRUTCII.  "WTell," said I, addressillg my companion, "' if you  wish to take the end by the window, I Nwill exchalge ll, with you-at least, for part of the journey." "O, never mind," he replied: "I am only going as flr as W illmin-tolln." Here, then, was a man who was only going about twenty miles, who had at first refused to give up his seat for the accommodation of the lady, and yet ex- pected mle to give up mine, which I had secured for a ride of a hundred and forty miles. O., the selfishness of the traveler! As I relnarked before, there are always a dozen or twNo of passengers who come aboard the car at the eleventh hour, and have a time of it getting seated. Amnong them there are usually two or three gentlemen with their ladies, as in this case, and they always come to me, the first thing, and ask me to give up my seat. I have long since, however, adopted a course to pursue on such occasions, which, although it involves a little fib or two--which are certainly pardonable--spares me all controversy. On being asked to remlove from my seat and take the wrolog end of another, I smilingly state that I would cheer- - fully do so if I were alone, but that unfortunately, my wife and three little boys are out on the platform, bidding some friends good-by, and will presently tome in to share the seat with me.

'Wllile there, my bill was only twenty-five or thirty dollars w    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6734-00000083"/> 160    JOHI SMITH ON A CrUTCII. a weaek, which they did not ask me to pay till I was ready to leave, several weeks after, and then I paid it without being asked. Meantime all the attaches of the hotel were so attentive, obliging and polite, that I did not find it necessary to kill a single one of them. The day following my arrival in Washington, the weather being fine, I walked out to Tenallytown, three miles from Georgetown, to visit the old ground on jwhich I had been encamped for several months, while a soldier, early in the war. I found the ground without difficulty, as well as a handsome, earthwork our division had thrown up while there, and which I myself had worked on. It had been originally named Fort Pennsylvania, but was now called Fort Reno. Thinking, I should like to walk in I approached the entrance, and found it guarded by a negro soldier, with musket and bayonet; while a sable corporal stood talking to him. "You can't come in dis place, sah," said the corporal, with an insolent grin, before I was near enough to solicit admittance. I could not help feeling cut by such a greeting as this, from a negro, at the entrance of a fort I had helped to build. I smothered my rising indignation, however, and with a sunny smile replied: "No admittance, eh?" "No, sah; guess not," was the taunting reply. "I did not know that," I rejoined, still keeping down my wrath. "I helped to build the fort, and thoucght I would like to take a look through it. However, I suppose you are ordered to allow no one to enter."   THE CITY OF MAGNIFICENT DISTANCES.  161 " Guess we is. You helped to build it, eh?" "Yes." "You didn't tink den us cullud fellahs 'd git posses- sion!" he said, with an insolent laugh. Without replying I turned and walked away. I cannot imagine why this black brute should thus wantonly insult an inoffensive person like me, and especially a crippled ex-soldier who had walked all the way from Georgetown to see his old camping- ground: but I have given the words as he spoke them. I do not relate the incident because it will please or displease any political party: I simply tell the truth. No one will fail to admit that it was hu- miliating and mortifying to me, after having helped to build the fort, to be insolently turned away from it by a coarse and ignorant negro. Had a white soldier t been on post there, he would have received me cordi- ally, and if his orders not to admit any one had been very strict, he would have sent some one to his offcer and asked permission to let me go in. There is always a certain sympathy between soldiers of one race; but I never yet saw any between white and black soldiers. Although I had been in Washington many times, I had never yet ascended the dome of the Capitol, or visited the embryo "Washington Monument ;" so, next day, I determined to visit both. In the Capitol, at the base of the stairway leading to the dome, the doorkeeper asked me if I had a pass to go up. "No," I replied; "I was not aware that any was re- quired." "    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6734-00000084"/> 162    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "Yes, visitors are not admitted to the dome with- out passes." "If you will tell me where to get one ,' I rejoined, "I will go and----") "O, never mind," he interrupted. "I won't send you for a pass. But can you walk to the top?" "O, yes." "Go ahead then, and never mind the pass. Don't fall." "Thank you," I replied, beginning the ascent. I must say this much for my race-for this was a zw/te man-that it is not made up entirely of selfish- ness. I frequently meet with little courtesies like this, and they are very gratifying to me: not for their intrinsic merit, alone, but because they show cheerful little gleamings of the bright side of the human heart. AWhen I reached the top of the dome, I felt a little tired(; but probably not much more so than others wtho ascended. It is a fatiguing task for any one, to ascend to the height of three hundred feet, by means of a wilding stairway. llhat same afternoon I visited the unfinislhed monu- l,ltt erected to the memory of George Washington. This monument is beautiful in design. It was to have 1,eLJ] five hundred 'feet high, surrounded at the base by a panltheon one hundred feet high aad two hundred a-nd. fifty feet in diameter. But it has only reached the height of one hundred and seventy feet, having there ab)rnptly stopped. It stands now a monument of the fbr tfullnes and ingratitude of the American p)ople. Till it is finish cd -which 1 fear will never   THE CITY OF MAGNIFICENT DISTANCES.  163 be -the whole land ought to be covered with one broad blush of shame. The monument was commenced years ago, by a certain "Association" which collected large sums of money for the purpose; and for a short time the work went on so actively that had it thus continued till now, the grand column of stone would have pierced the clouds, and there would have been no way of getting at the top except by means of a balloon. It stopped short, however, at the height mentioned; and its square blunt-looking top is covered, with boards, to keep the rain off; the poorly protected walls are cracking; and the stray swine are rooting and wallow- ing about in the mud at its base. Not seventy years have elapsed since George Washington, without whom we would probably never have been an inde- pendent nation, passed from earth, and now, alas! it seems that his memory has also passed from the hearts of his unworthy countrymen. Take John Smith's word for it, reader, a nation that can thus soon forget its father and founder, the very author of its being, must, at no very distant day, lose sight of itself. Byron says: ( There is the moral of all human tales; This but the same rehearsal of' the past; First freedom, and then glory-when that fails, Wealth, vice, corruption, barbarism at last." In the Revolutionary war we gained our freedom; in the war of 1812 we perpetuated it; in the Mexican war we gained glory; then followed wealth, in the acquisition of California, Texas and other territory; in the recent civil war, we alnost reached the vice, corruption and barbarism.    <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6734-00000085"/> 161    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. Next clay I rode out to Georgetown, in a street-car, and then hired a riding-horse, to visit Camp Pierpont, Virginia, several miles from the Chain Bridge, where I had spent my first winter in the army. The pro- prietor of the livery stable, as he led the horse out, satddled and bridled, said: "You can ride a horse, eh?" "With ease," I replied. How will you manage to get on?" he asked. "This way," I replied; and I placed one hand on the saddle and the other on my crutch, and sprung up with ease. He opened his eyes with astonishment. "Whew! You get on a horse easier than I can. But don't get thrown off:" "I wonlt," I replied. "Get up, old boss!" And touching the animal with a spur I had put On--I only wear one, on ordinary occasions-darted away toward the river at a brisk gallop. I visited the old camping-ground, and had the satisfactio; n of finding the exact spot-now lonely and deserted-on which the cabin of our mess had stood durinaO the first winter of the war, and on which I had slept many a night, with a thin blanket and hard punlcheon floor under me, a wood fire in the cllimney near my feet-I had two of the articles then-and my knapsack, containing an extra shirt and pair of drawxers, a few writing-materials, letters and plioto- graphs of friends, under my head.

I had visited the old ground because I thought it would be a pleasure, but somehow, when the scenes of the past came crowding back upon me, and I remembered so many of my jovial comrades, now no more, a melancholy settled over me; and when I turned away toward Washington, it was with a sadness of heart that I cannot express.    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6734-00000086"/> 166    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER    XXIII. ,MTH'S FXPERIENCE ON A    SKATE. SPENT the ensuing winter in Philadelphia, the great city which was laid out by William Penn, Esquire, who took a checker-board-an article used in a game invariably played " on the square ,'- for a pattern, and, hence, laid it out in squares that were perfectly square, and have remained so to the present day. Mr. Penn deserves great credit for his peaceable manner of acquiring the land on which the city is built. Instead of going to work and killing the poor innocent savages, like others did, he pur- chased the land from them, at a good round price in buttons, keys, tooth picks, shoe-pegs, marbles, rum and the like. This course, besides speaking well for the goodness of his heart, is also strong evidence of his superior judgment and foresight, as the Indians at that time were too numerous to be easily overcome. One day, in the middle of the skating season, I concluded to go down to Eastwick Park, Mr. R. O. Lowry's popular resort, and amuse myself awhile by watching the skaters tumbling head over heels and cracking their brain-pans on the ice. I always had a passion for seeing any one fall, especially on skates. There is a calm, quiet enjoyment about it-to the   SMITH'S EXPERIENCE ON A SKATE.    167 observer-that is not equaled by any thing else. "We always," remarks La Rochefoucault "have strength enough to bear the misfortunes of others," a saying which, however humfiliating it may be to confess it, has a certain truth. The ancient Greek writer Isi- dorus puts it very bluntly when he says: "Nothing is more pleasant than to sit at ease in the harbor and behold the shipwreck of others," a sentiment which is repeated in an old English song: "I wander not to seek for more: In greatest storm I sit on shore, And laugh at those that toil in vain, To get what must be lost again." to wit, their life. But to return to myself. !For the information of non-residents of Philadel- phia, I will state that Eastwick Park is the ,largest skating-park in the world. It is a resort for pleasure seekers, both in the winter and in the summer: for skating and dancing in the former season; and dancing and rowing in the latter. It is something for Philadelphia to boast of, and for which she is indebted to the enterprise of the Park IKing, Mr. R. O. Lowry. The smooth lake of ice was alive with skaters, of both sexes, and the scene was one of the gayest. I had not seen much skating since my return from the army, and, O, how this made me regret my inability to enjoy the delightful exercise. For the first time, I heartily regretted that I had ever served my country, and lost one of my nether limbs; and, in my vexation, felt that if I had it to do over, my loved land might go to the deuce before I would sacrifice a leg, and thus deprive myself of such delightful recreation.    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6734-00000087"/> 168    JOTHN SMITHT ON A CRUTCH. "Never more," I muttered, "will my nimble feet glide over the smooth ice, and the bright, ringing steel of my skates sing gleeful songs behind me, while I fly like the wind! Never more shall I go it at the rate of twenty miles an hour, tumble heels over head on the dear, clear, smooth, cold ice, get my head cracked and my eyes blacked, and spring up and try it again, cheerful and happy! Ah, John Smith! John Smith! thy skating days are over! They are numbered with the things of the past, and with the things that were, and are not!" Just then, the veteran skater, Colonel?" 4 ", an excellent friend of mine, came gliding gracefully along, to the shore of the lake, where I was standing, and seeing me, said, with his usual cheerful and jovial manner: "How do you do, Smith? You are looking on as though you would like to try it." "I wish it were possible, Colonel," I replied. "Did you skate before you went into the army?" "O, yes." "W Vell, why don't you try it?" "On a crutch?" "Certainly-as active as you are, I have no doubt. you could skate. Try it!" "I would as soon risk another battle," said I. "Who ever heard of a man skating on one leg?" "Have you never heard of the like?" "I think not." "I have then. Last year, I read of a one-legged skater in Boston. He was hard to beat too, it was said."   SMITH'S EXPERIENCE ON A SKATE.   169 "Ah? Is that so?" "I assure you it is. Go into the skate-room, get a skate and try it. There is a little nook of ice extending behind the buildings, try it there first, and if you find it a success, you can venture out upon the main body of ice." "I believe I will," I said. I went- into the skate-room, and somewhat aston- ished the clerk by asking for " half-a-pair of skates." "Are you in earnest?" he asked. "Yes, by all means." "Can you skate?" "Yes," I replied, although I had never yet tried it in my present condition; " no mere amateur can beat me."  - He gave me the skate, leni me a gimlet and file, and fuinished me with a couple of nails. I drove one of the nails into the lower end of the crutch and the other into the end of the cane, and filed'them off sharp about half-an-inch from the wood. I then put on the skate and went out upon the ice in rear of the row of buildings. With some misgivings, I stepped on the ice and gave myself, a shove. I sailed out pretty nicely, and didn't fall. To my astonishment and delight, I discovered that I could skate nearly as well as ever. This discovery lent me confidence and vigor, and, without hesitation, I glided out upon the extensive lake of ice, among the throng of skaters, where I was regarded as a novelty; and, in a word, I created quite a sensation. I felt that I would much rather all the eyes turned upon me had been bullets aimed at me; but I "cheeked" it out, with all the t    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6734-00000088"/> 170    JOIN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "brass "I could muster, and glided around, apparently so much at my ease, that the observers might have fancied it was not my first attempt to skate on one leg, but that, on the contrary, I had skated many thousand miles thus. I soon met my friend, the Colonel, who was highly elated at my success. As this was my first exercise of this kind, since my return from the army, I only remained on the ice about five hours that dayT: by the end of which time I felt as though I might travel two or three times around the globe on a skate. I did get a fall or two, of course. In fact, I had not been on the ice fifteen minutes, when I got to skating too fast -my skate going so fast that I couldn't keep up-and the result was that I presently had the ice for a pillow, and lay there gazing at the clouds, with only one overhanging skate-clad foot to interrupt the view. Then, before I had time to stir from this novel position, a handsome young lady, who was try- ing the backward skating, endeavored to skate over me-a feat frequently attempted without success-and the result was, she violently took a seat upon my sto- mach and jobbed one of her elbows in my eye. She struggled up and said, "O, excuse me! Did I hurt you?" "O, no; not at all!" I replied, although she had nearly knocked the breath out of me. "I am glad of it," she said, skating away. I recovered my crutch and cane, and arose, yonder- ing whether she meant that she was glad she hadn't hurt me or glad she had fallen on me. I didn't feel glad about any thing.   SMITH'S EXPERIENCE ON A SKATE.    171 This was my first skating adventure, on a crutch; but I have skated many times since. So, you see, that, after all, the loss of a limb does not necessarily deprive a man of such little enjoyments. Energy, will and self-confidence will work wonders. What I want to do, I do. I have swam in the Schuylkill, Delaware, Monongahela, Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and in all the lakes; skated hundreds of miles; ridden hundreds of miles on horseback; walked hundreds of miles--all with one leg. There are only two things I can't do, which another man can. One is to run; the other is to sit cross-legged. I do not say this to boast; for John Smith is modest. I merely mention these facts, that the public may know what a one- legged man can do, and that he's "a man for a' that."    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6734-00000089"/> 172    JOIIN SMITH ON A CRUTCH.' CHAPTER    XXIV. PYER THE JOUNTAINS. SA Spring approached, I resolved to take a western tour; and with that view left Philadel- phia in February. For the sake of variety, having frequently traveled through Pennsylvania, I concluded to go to Pittsburg via Baltimore, Mary- land; Fairmont, in Western Virginia; and Union- town, Western Pennsylvania-certainly a circuitous route. I desired to visit some friends in south- western Pennsylvania, however, and it was not much out of my way, after all, to take the Philadelphia and Wilmington, and Baltimore and Ohio Railroads. One very cold day, I went from Philadelphia to Baltimore, and at ten o'clock that night left the latter place on the express train that was to run through to lWheeling-intending myself to get off at Fairmont. On this occasion, just after taking a seat in the car, a gentleman sat down by me, and after regarding my countenance attentively for a moment, said: "Pardon me: isn't your name Smith?" I pardoned him, as desired, and told him it was. "First name John?" There was no denying it, and I replied in' the affir mative.   OVER THE MOUNTAINS.      173 "Delighted to meet you!" he exclaimed, as we shook hands cordially. "When did-you leave Nashville?" "I never left it," was my response. "I was never there."  "No? Then excuse me: you cannot be the gentle- man I supposed you, although your appearance and name strikingly correspond with those of a person I knew in Nashville a year ago-especially the name. he had also lost a leg, as you have." "A remarkable coincidence," said I. "In the course of my own travels, I have met with a great many of me-in name." My fellow-traveler was an agreeable and good- humored gentleman, and I related to him the follow- ing anecdote of Doctor B. Frank Palmer, of Phila- delphia, the great manufacturer of artificial limbs. Receiving an order for a leg from plain John Smith one day, and being in a merry mood, the Doctor sat down and answered John's letter thus: "Look here! What do you mean? I have already furnished you with five hundred of my patent lilbs, and I don't think the Government allows you aily more. However, I'll send this one yet. and if you continulte so extravagant in the use of patent legs, I advise you to set up a manufactory for your own ac- connmmodation." * * * The Doctor, who has manufactured thousands of ar- tificial limbs for mutilated, soldiers, once jocosely Ce- marked to the writer that he found, by referrinig to his books, that John Smith had been literally hacked to pieces during the war. Hle had had his right hand cut off; his left hand; his right arm below the elbow; his left arlm below- the elbow; his right arm above    <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6734-00000090"/> 174    JOIH SMTIf ON A CRULTCH. the elbow; his left arm above' the elbow; his right arm at shoulder-joint, with skin-flap ; his left arm at shoulder-joint, with skin-flap; his right toes; his left toes; his right foot; his left foot; his right leg below the knee; his left leg below the knee; his right leg above the knee; his left leg above the knee; both hands; both arms below the elbow; both arms above the elbow; both feet; both legs below the knee; both legs above the knee; the right arm and left leg; the right arm and right leg; the right arm and both legs; the left arm and right leg; the left arm and left leg; the left arm and both legs; both arms and both legs; et cetera. All that can remain of him now, it might well be inferred, is about the size and shape of a sack of wheat, though far less useful to himself and the world. The number of plain John Smiths on the Doctor's book is quite astounding, to say nothing of the innu- merable John A., John B., John C., John D., John E., John F., John G., John I., John I., John J., John K., John L., John M., John N., John 0., John P., John Q., John R., John S., John T., John U., John V., John W., John X., John Y., and John Z., Smiths!' Things went on very finely through the night of my journey over the snow-covered mountains of Vir- ginia, and in the morning the train stopped at Cum- berland, on the Potomac, where the passengers took breakfast. Then we thundered on again among the frosted hills. Within ten miles of Grafton, Western Virginia, the wheels of the forward truck of the car I was in, jumped off the track, and went bouncing along on the ties beside the iron rails, in a way calculated to   OVER THE MOUNTAINS.      1'15 startle the timid. I sprang from my seat, seized the bell-cord, and gave it a vigorous pull; but although I surely made the engine-bell ring, I could see no im- mediate diminution in the speed of the train. I knew that this state of things could not last long before the car should break to pieces. The stove was soon shaken from its moorings, and fell over, scatter- ing the fire about and filling the car with smoke and dust; several of the seats were also shaken loose, a deliberate crashing was heard; and, glancing around among the passengers, I saw as delicious a collection of pale faces as I had ever seen. The men all sprang to their feet, the women screamed, and some raised their windows, as though to squeeze through and drop out. I raised my window and thrust my arm out, so that I might thus cling to the side of the car, in case the floor should be shattered and torn out, as it must soon have been if the train had not been checked At last, the welcome sound of the whistle was heard the brakes were applied and the speed of the train began to slacken. Just then, the axles of the front truck broke, the frame smashed up, and the floor of the car began to give way. With screams of horror the passengers all rushed to the rear end of the car; but in another moment, before any further damaele was done or any one hurt, the train came to a full stop. Then the passengers all rushed out as quickly as possible, as though there were still danger within and some of them got their ribs strained, squeezing through the door. I walked out and examined the wreck. Up to this time, I had not felt any trepida- tion; but now, when it was all over, and I ricalized    <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6734-00000091"/> 170    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. wlhat terrible danger we had passed through, I could not help trembling. Had the train proceeded fifty yards further, the car we were in must have been torn to pieces, and it would have been indeed a lucky pas- selnger who would have escaped death or severe injuiry. There was one car in the rear of us, and as the wrecked car could not be moved, the two were left standing, and all the passengers crowded into the three or four cars in our front. Thus we proceeded to Grafton, where other cars were added. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad is very well con- ducted, and accidents on it are not of frequent occur- rence. It just chanced to be my luck to witness this. I heard the conductor say that it was the only acci- dent of any kind that had happened to his train for three years. At Fairmont, on the Monongahela river, I got off the train, and took the stage for Uniontown, which is forty-five miles from the above place. After spending a few weeks in Fayette county, I went down the Monongahela river to Pittsburg, intend- ingl to remain there a few days, and learn whether the sun was to be seen there or not.   DIFFICULTY WITH THE OWNER OF PITTSBURG. 1" CHAPTER    XXV. PIFFICULTY WITH THE PWNEF OF fITTSBUPG. ARRIVED in the "Iron City," one morning, and having registered my name at an hotel on Grant street, I went down to the "Diamond," to see a friend of mine in a wholesale grocery there. Having had a talk with him and promised to call again before leaving the city, I bade him good morning; and, in a quiet, modest, unassuming manner, took my way up Diamond alley, toward Grant street, intending to return to my hotel. As I crossed Wood street, I observed a considerable crowd collected about the corner of that street and Diamond alley, and discov- ered that there was a fire in the vicinity, and that the house and goods of Openheimer &amp; Co., were feeding the flames. A steamer was puffing away as usual, to try which could damage and destroy the most goods, water or fire. [This is a question which has never been satisfactorily decided.] Feeling no curiosity to see the fire, I crossed Wood street, passed through the crowd, and continued up Diarnond alley. I had not walked far, and was abolit clear of the crowd, when an insolent voice called out 1ear me: "Get out of the way, you! Do you hear? I'l D  o you hear'    <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6734-00000092"/> 178    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. Chief of Police, and am here to keep the crowd away!" And immediately, before I had time to look up, a hand was laid violently on my shoulder, and I was nearly snatched from my foot. Now, fancying that I was a "free white male" citizen of the United States, "of the age of twenty- one years and upwards," I was quite otherwise than delighted with this extraordinary treatment at the hands of the arrogant chief of villains; and turning upon him, and verbally apprising him of the fact that he was a "scoundrel," I was about to "belt" him "over the ear" with my cane, when a quiet gentleman of prepossessing appearance, walked up to me, re- strained me in a friendly manner, and said: "Come, my friend, I will see you righted for this. He has treated you shamefully. I suppose you have been a soldier; I have, too. I am General?** * * , I am also a lawyer. Come with me." "Thank you," I said. "It was an unprovoked assault," he pursued, as we walked up Diamond alley.  "That man is Bob. * * * *, Chief of the Police. He is a coarse, igno- rant, insolent, overbearing man. He insults every one that comes in his way, if he happens to be a little out of humor. You do not live here?" "No, I live in Philadelphia. I thank you for your kindness. If you will tell me where to find an alder- man, I will have this fellow's case attended to." "Go to Alderman B * * * * *," said he; and he directed me where to find it. "I will be a witness, if necessary. Prefer a charge of assault and battery against Robert I * * * *, Chief of Police, and you   DIFFICULTY WITH THE OWNER OF PITTSBURG. 179 will find Mr. B * * ** * a man who will do you jus- tice." "Thank you; I will go at once." And I went to the office of Alderman B * * * * , who did not chance to be any bosom friend of the Chief. "Alderman," said I, "my name is John Smith, and I reside in Philadelphia. I come before you to prefer against one Robert H * * * *,-a fellow calling him- self Chief of Police-a charge of assault and battery." What! Not assault and battery on you--a crip- ple!" "Yes, sir, sad as the case is, it is true. I charge him with assault and battery. Please take my deposi- tion. I have other witnesses. General?* * * * *  is one of them. He saw it." "Ah! He was present?" "' Yes, sir." I was then sworn to tell "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth;" and I then made my statement-" in accordance with the facts." "Come to-morrow afternoon at four o'clock," said the Alderman. "I, will have him here to answer at that time." "I will. Thank you." Next day I was at the Alderman's " on time." I had not been there long before Robert H * * *  stepped in. The Alderman had just finished making out a commitment for a lady, who had struck another in the face eight times with a broomstick for doubt- ing her word, and saying so, pointedly; and he was now ready to attend to our case.    <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6734-00000093"/> 180    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "Alderman," said Chief Robert, with his usual arrogant air, "I want to get this trifling affair delayed for a week, as all my witnesses are out of town. I can't attend to it before next Friday. That will be just a week from to-day." "Alderman," I put in, rising from my chair, "I respectfully object to any such delay. I am traveling, and it is not consistent with my interests to remain in the city beyond a day or two: and the prisoner knows it." On my styling the defendant the prisoner, he scowled on me like a very demon, and I felt that it wouldn't have been pleasant to have had my life in his exclusive keeping, just then. "Alderman," he said, fairly choking with malig- nant anger, " it will be impossible to get my witnesses soon, and you must give me a show." "It is singular," I urged, addressing the Alderman, "that I, who am a comparative stranger here, can find and produce my witnesses so much sooner than the defendant, who is an official here, and ought to be well acquainted. I most earnestly object to any such delay, as it would be scarcely just to detain me here, on expense, especially when business calls me away soon." "Probably," insinuated the Chief, " the gentleman's business is not so urgent-if he is a gentleman." "Mr. I t * i," said the Alderman, who was too honest to allow any one to be insulted in his office, "the plaintiff appears to be a gentleman. However, it is not to be discussed here whether he is or not. That is not to the point."   DIFFICULTY WITH THE OWNER OF PITTSBURG. 181 "Mr. Alderman," I remarked, calmly, "if our respective behavior here were taken as evidence, I think I could be proved quite as much of a gentleman as the defendant." "We'll see about that by the time I get my wit- nesses," said Chief Robert. "I've been keeping an eye on him since he came to the city. I know --" "Mr. H * * *, interrupted the Alderman, "I cannot, and will not, allow any such talk in my office! For you, Chief of Police, to speak thus, is to insinuate that Mr. Smith is a suspicious character. There is nothing in his appearance to warrant such an insinua- tion. But let me not talk of that. Let us proceed with the case. This is Friday: I will postpone the hearing only till Monday. I think that will be deal- ing fairly by both." ' It will be no such thing!" vociferated the irate official. "You are not giving me a fair show! You are showing partiality toward--" Mr. H * * * *!" interrupted the Alderman, peremp- torily; "not another such word in my office! I shall "But I'll be--" "Do you hear? Not another word! I shall send the case right down to court! You must go there and answer to the charge." "Send it! and be  " Boiling over with rage, the Chief had seized his hat, bolted from the office, banged the door after him, and thus prevented me from hearing the conclusion of his invective. "The case will be tried in court," said the-Aldel-    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6734-00000094"/> 182    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. man, to me. "Be at the court-house on MonCdayy, and give your evidence before the Grand Jury. By Tuesday, then, it may be tried." "I will; thank you." Monday came, and I gave my evidence before the Grand Jury, making the case against II H " * * as strong as I could, without swerving from " the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth: s'help-" etc." A "bill" was "found" against him, in the brief space of sixty seconds; and early next morning the case came up before the "Criminal Court." It was such a plain case against the poor cuss, that his counsel advised him to plead guilty; which he did. He was then severely reprimanded by the Judge, in a long speech, in which he urged upon him the importance of being careful about laying hands on an inoffensive person, without a warrant, and mildly sentenced him to pay a fine of twenty-five dollars, and the costs; making in all, the handsome little sum of seventy- three dollars and eighty-two cents: and what was still more aggravating and humiliating to the dread(?) Chief, he was immediately taken into custody, by two tipstaves, and escorted into the sheriff's office, where he had to pay the fine and costs, "on sight." The affair cost me nothing. In fact, I gained by it; for I was about that time commencing to write a work of fiction, (since published), and I had been for several days at a loss for some one to represent the villainous character. This let me out, nicely. I named my ' villain "Robert H * * -. , gave an exact description of him, went on swimmingly with my   DIFFICULTY WITH THE OWNER OF PITTSBURG. 183 novel, and, at the conclusion, brought him to a terri- ble and tragic death.* * THE WHTE ROCKS; Or, the Robbers of the Monongahela.

CHAPTER    XXV I, PECULIARITIES OF TFAVELERS. \TEXT morning I took an early train for Whecl- ing, which city I desired to visit on my west- ward way. On this occasion, about twelve minutes before the train started, two men came in, and, desiring to sit together and finding no seat wholly vacant, one of them had the incredible, the unparalleled, the unex- amnpled, the unheard-of audacity to ask me to move and sit with another person-a thing I have refused to do even to accommodate a lady. It was not yet quite light in the car, as the sun was not up, and I pointed to my crutch, that stood leaning against the back of the seat in front of me, and stated that I had been badly shot in the knee the previous night, in a saloon difficulty, and that it was impossible for me to move with any sort of comfort or ease. Moreover, I observed, that my uncle was to accompany me on my journey, to take care of me, that he would of course occupy the seat with me, and that he had just gone to a neighboring saloon to get me a glass of ale and hand it in at the window. Otherwise, I said, I' sshould accommodate themn by moving to any part of the car they might desire, and take pleasure in it.   PECULIARITIES OF TRAVELERS.    185 Tlaking all I said for the truth,-and thus makeing a wholesale mistake--they turned and went to the rear end of the car, where they urgently requested a re- spectable-looking negro passenger to get up and let them have his seat. But he rknew his rights, and, knowing, durst maintain and he maintained them after this manner: "Guess not." ", O, come, now," argued one of the two passengers; "you might as well. You'll be just as comfortable  solme--" "Ywell, now, I guess I won't leab dis yer, by golly 1" "You might have to," suggested one of the Cauca- sians. "IHab to? Like to see de man--" "For half-a-cent I'd move you!" The darkey was now very much "riled," and be- ing, besides, a little drunk, and naturally ill-natured and habitually profane in his language, he railed out thus: "No, I'll be (profanity) if you does! (Profanity) my heart, if I jis' didn' fight fur dis (profanity) country, and I'll be (profanity, profanity, profanitied) if I ain't as good as any oder (profanity) man! I know what my rights is!

No one' is going to take it from you! Now, another word out of your black head, and I'll split it for you, and throw it out of the window, a piece at a time 1" The two troublesome travelers had, meantime, located themselves in separate seats, as near each other as possible; the darkey said no more, and quiet reigned for a moment or so. Glancing out at my window, which I had raised, I presently saw two Irishmen-both drunk-approach- ing the car; and one of them was carrying a valise, a fiddle, a hat-box, a saw, a side of leather, an overcoat and an extra pair of boots. He was evidently going on a journey; but the other was in his shirt-sleeves, and had only accompanied him to the train to see him off. "Good-by, Mike," said he in his shirt-sleeves. "Take gude care o' yer-sel." "I'll do that, Zhammie." said the traveler, who was the drunkest of the two. "When'll'seeyez'gin, m'b'y?" "I'll mate ye'n Whalin', Mike. Steek till the cause, me boy. Don't forgit the Fanians an' yer counthry!" By this time, a number of the passengers who sat   PECULIARITIES OF TRAVELERS.    187 on the same side of the car with me had raised their windows, and were now listening to this dialogue, much amused. The conversation was carried on in loud, harsh tones. "F'rgit m' counthry an' th' cause? Och! I shud thaink naught," said the Milesian traveler, who was now about to ascend the steps to the platform of the car I was in. He paused a moment, before blundering up, and then struck up a patriotic Fenian song, the first verse of which was something like this: "Och! Kra! Kri mo kreeh! mee barry braugh, Augh quih-queeh, McQuairy,! Grah me Kreh! Grah me Kree! Ahkushlee! Hurrah! Mike graughin, Och borry bro!" Good me b'y!" exclaimed his friend, grasping his hand.  "Wull done, that!  Now, good-by, Mike, Tak care o' yer-sel!" "Good-by, till ye, Zhammie. God be good till ye! After shaking hands cordially, they parted. He in his shirt-sleeves, James, by name, walked away, with some sadness naturally engendered by the part- ing; while Michael entered the oar and took a seat by the darkey-for all the rest were entirely occupied by this time-his saw, as he sat down, accidentally grazing the darkey's cheek, and coming within half- an-inch of sawing one of his white eyes out. "'Scuse me, dairlint," said Mike; and he deposited his luggage down among both their feet, threw him- self carelessly back in his seat, with his cheek resting    <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6734-00000097"/> 188    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. on his dusky companion's shoulder, and soon fell asleep. The pleasant (?) time the conductor had waking him, when he came round for his ticket, might be described with excellent effect, by a professional humorist; but let the reader picture it in his im- agination.   MoCULLOCH'S LEAP.      189 CHAPTER XXVII . McFULLOCH'S JEAP. A BOUT eleven o'clock, A. M., the train arrived at the little village of Bridgeport, opposite Wheel- ing, where an omnibus was in waiting to carry over the river all passengers destined for the city. Between Bridgeport and Wheeling is an island, whose name I forget, and there are two bridges required for communication between the two places. That on the Wheeling side is a very excellent suspension bridge, ninety or a hundred feet above the water, with a span of one thousand feet. That on -the. Bridgeport side is a substantial wooden bridge with five or six piers. The steamboat channel is, as may naturally be supposed, on the Wheeling side of the island. I and my trunk took passage on the bmnibus, and I had reason to be pleased with the gentlemanly de- lmeanor of the conductor, and with his moderate charges. The first object of interest near Wheeling that I desired to visit, was the steep declivity down which the pioneer McCulloch made his fearful plunge on horseback, when pursued by the Indians. Thii, if my memory serves me correctly, happened in 1790.    <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6734-00000098"/> 190    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. It was on a beautiful day, late in March, that I arrived in Wheeling; and, having taken dinner at a comfortable and tidy hotel, I walked into the sitting- room where several gentlemen were seated poring over the newspapers. I looked around me before venturing to speak to any one, and was not long in making up my mind as to which to address my in quiries to. This was a man of forty-five or fifty years, who was in the act of folding up a paper he had been reading, and whom I judged to be a resident of Wheeling. Besides, his countenance was clearly the index of a good mind, and a noble and congenial heart. As I afterward learned, his name was Charles Cra- craft-he was familiarly styled Charlie-an intelligent, well-known and much respected citizen of Wheeling. He and I became the warmest friends during the brief week that I remained in Wheeling, and his society delighted me. He was one of those " gemns" of which Gray speaks in his "Elegy in a Country Churchyard." A man better versed in history and general literature I have seldom met. Few notable events ever hap- pened in the world that Charlie could not tell all about. Why he had never made his mark in the world, I could not tell; but I felt sure he might have done so. In addition to his love of reading, and a good memory, I found him possessed of most excellent judgment, strong reasoning powers, an impressive address liberality of views and an admirable know- ledge, of language and composition. With all his gifts-gifts that would enable a man to. shine any- where-he was not known beyond his native city;   MeCULLOCI'S LEAP.       191 and that is why I regard him as one of those "gems" which Gray says are " born to blush unseen." Well, it was to Charlie Cracraft that I addressed my inquiries regarding the place where McCulloch, under pressing circumstances, executed his celebrated equestrian feat. "It is barely half-a-mile distant," said Charlie. "'Are you going to see it?" "Yes, by all means," I replied. "It is just outside the city. You go to the upper end of the city, and-however, I was just thinking of taking a walk myself, and I will accompany you, if you desire." "I shall be pleased with your company," said I, "and I thank you." We were friends- from   that moment. Charlie arose, and we left the hotel and walked up the street. Emerging from the upper end of the city we followed a pike for a few hundred yards, which led us to a considerable elevation, where I found laid before me about as grand a scene as I ever beheld. "Here," said Charlie, "is where McCulloch rode down." We were standing with our faces toward the east; behind us, deep among the tall hills, flowed the Ohio river, and before us was a valley of great depth, through which Wheeling creek wound its way. This stream  flowed directly toward the Ohio river, till it reached the base of the declivity immediately beneath us; then turning about, guarded away from the river, as it were, by the long, steep, intervening ridge, it flowed clear around Wheeling, and emptied into the river below.  That portion of the creek which we    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6734-00000099"/> 192    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. could see, hemmed in by a semicircular range of hills on its right side, formed a path similar in shape to a horse-shoe; only its principal curve was more abrupt. It was at this abrupt curve that the daring McCul- loch plunged down the declivity. He had been pur- sued from a northerly direction, by the Indians, and intended to gallop along the verge of the descent, and turn toward the east, as the creek turned far below. But just here he found himself intercepted by another band of savages, and retreat in that direction cut off. Behind him lay the Ohio river, three hundred feet below, on either hand was a horde of howling blood- thirsty savages, and before him was a steep descent of several hundred feet, whose face was interrupted by several perpendicular ledges of rock; and, in this terrible exigence, he clutched his reins tightly, and spurred his horse quickly over the brink and down the fearful declivity. It is not really so steep as some who have read the account suppose, for a line drawn from the summit to the base, where the creek flows, would form an angle with the horizon of only between forty and forty-five degrees; but at intervals there are precipitous ledges of rock, quite perpen- dicular, of from ten to twenty feet in height. That the horse and rider plunged down over them in safety, seems little less than a miracle. This range of hills, or rather this ridge, is higher and even steeper in some places than at the point where McCulloch plunged down. Charlie and I walked along the verge of the precipice, ascending gradually, till we came to a point over four hundred feet above   McCULLOCH'S LEAP.      193 the high-water mark of the river. Fron this point, we could see over many miles of Ohio landscape beyond the river. It was at this highest point that, a few years ago, a man named Wheat, a citizen of Wheeling, actually drove over the precipice in a two-horse sleigh. Two other persons were in the sleigh with him, riding along the summit of the ridge, and on his declaring that he was going to eclipse McCulloch, they jumped out, and the fool actually touched up his horses and drove down the precipice. His name was Wheat, as I stated; but Charlie told me that rye had more to do with it than any one else. Down tumbled Wheat, the sleigh and two horses; and only that good luck that ever seems to attend an intoxicated man could have saved him from a violent and speedy death. While the sleigh was dashed to splinters, and both the horses precipitated into Wheeling creek and killed, Mr. Wheat lodged among some stunted trees, about half-way down-- badly bruised and "stove up," it is true, but still alive and in moderate spirits. He is still living, but has been a cripple ever since his mad and daring sleigh-ride.  Charlie and I returned from our pleasant walk, feeling as though we had been acquainted for years. We had considerable conversation, on various topics,  and I will nevet forget a remark I heard him make.  We were speaking of religion, and I found that he, like myself, was a dissenter from the orthodox faith. Speaking of the doubts and perplexities that always arose, when he thought on the subject, he said: 13    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6734-00000100"/> 194    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "If I possessed the wealth of the whole world; if the lands, the houses, the gold, the gems, the king- doms, and the thrones were mine; I would gladly give them all to know the TRUTH!" The reader has, no doubt, heard or read of a certain cave among the rocks on Wheeling creek, in which an Indian once concealed himself with a rifle, and, by imitating the voice of a turkey, decoyed several men from the fort in succession, and shot them. His stratcogem was at last detected, however, and a pio- neer who was as shrewd as he, went in the night, concealed himself in the neighborhood, and in the morning saw the dusky savage go and ensconce him- self in his usual hiding-place,.and begin the song of the turkey. The pioneer, who could see his dark visage among -the rocks, took aim with his rifle, and with one shot silenced him forever. Charlie pointed this cave out to me, and I went the next day and visited it. He would have accom- panied me, but he was subject to rheumatism, and was suffering considerably that day; so I went alone. The cave is about a mile from Wheeling. I had to climb up the rocks fifteen or twenty feet, in order to get into it, and I sat there awhile, aiming my crutch at a stump beyond Wheeling creek, and imagining myself the cunning but unfortunate Indian who per- sonated a turkey and got shot for it. The cave is not large-in fact, one cannot stand erect; but half-a-dozen persons could be stowed in it in a reclining position, provided none of them  were ladies in capacious crinoline. Returning from the cave, via. McCulloch's Leap,   MCCULLOCH'S LEAP.       195 it was my lot to encounter one of the greatest bores I ever met. He was one of those persons who, it is said, can " talk a man to death." He made me think of the celebrated lines of Pope: "No place so sacred from such fops is barred, Nor-is Paul's church more safe than Paul's churchyard. Nay, fly to altars, there they talk you dead, And fools rush in where angels fear to tread." He lived in a solitary house, by the creek at the base of the declivity, and he happened to come out just as I was about to make the ascent. He'was a fast talker, said a great many words in a few seconds, and often spoke a good many seconds at a time. "How do you do, sir?  How do you do?" he said, familiarly. ' Fine day." !"Very," I said. "Quite pleasant." I wanted to get back to my hotel, for my stomach admonished me that it was fully dinner-time; and so, I made an attempt to pass on and begin to climb the hill. It was no  use, though. He commenced by asking me if I lost my leg in the army, then went on asking one question after another--in such rapid suc- cession that I only got each one about half answered -till he had asked three times the number usually proposed. He asked questions such as I had never thought of before, and kept on so fast that I fancied he asked them merely for the pleasure of it, and not for the sake of hearing them answered. He not only asked me if I was born in this country, where I was brought up, what kind of saw-mills we had there, and what barbers charged for cutting hair; but also desired to know if I had ever looked at the moon    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6734-00000101"/> 196    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. through a telescope, and if I thought corn as good a diet for horses as oats. Every question that any mortal man could think of in so short a time, he asked me, till I finally felt that I must either move on, or die. I moved on, in the midst of the conversation, and looked back over my shoulder now and then to answer questions, which he continued to ask. "Are you going to walk up the hill?" "Yes." "Can you do it?" "O, yes." "Aint you afraid you'll fall?" ( No." I began to ascend the acclivity, and he talked on. "Did you ever go up such a steep place before?" "Yes, steeper," I yelled back, thinking of Bunker Hill Monument. "And didn't fall?" he continued, as I took another labored stride onward and upward. "No. "Wasn't you afraid of falling?" "No." "You must be plucky." As this did not strictly demand any answer, I took advantage of a momentary pause to say, "Good day." "Good---But say? What regiment did you say you were in?" "Eighth Pennsyl -- " "Did you know a man in that regiment by the name of-" I had now ascended to the height of seventy-five   MCGULLOCH'S LEAP.      197 or eighty feet, when I stopped on a sort of shelf, to rest a moment, turned about and said: "What was his name?"

If I ever visit McCulloch's Leap again, I will remain at the summit, and not go near enough the verge for that dread man, who lives in the lone cottage far below, to catch a glimpse of me!   CINCINNATI.       199 CHAPTER    XXVIII. CINCINNATI. TT walkabout the first of April, when the weather was delightful, and the nights were lighted by the full moon, that I left Wheeling for Cincinnati, on board the new little steamer "Como." I had a plea- sant voyage of two days and two nights, and might write a good many pages descriptive of it; but that's old. Moreover, it is not John-Smithian. As I wished to remain in Cincinnati for a month, I hired a lodging-room for that length of time, paying the money in advance, because it was not perfectly clear that I wasn't a " deep-dyed villain." The landlady, for the sum of eighteen dollars, placed me in possession of a neat, tidy room, upstairs, and I there wrote and slept for one month; taking my meals at a neighboring saloon. The proprietress of my lodging-house, who was a German lady-one of the Germanest I ever saw-ac- companied me to the hall-door as I walked out to have my trunk sent up. On reaching the foot of the stairs in the hall, I noticed a room on the left-hand side, with the door standing open, and, involuntarily glancing in, perceived that it was handsomely fur- nished.    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6734-00000103"/> 200    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "Dat," said the landlady, whose knowledge of Eng- lish, it will be perceived, was very imperfect, ( is-is -two-ah-ah-play-mens-actors, you knows. Dey rent it from me. Dirty-five tollar pays." "Quite reasonable," said I. "A nice room. Where do they play?" "At de-de Deaters, you knows." I had naturally inferred as much, but pretended to receive this as a piece of extraordinary information, and said-: "Ah? Indeed?"            " "Yes.. Dey gets-lots-great big much--vat you call 'em-vages." "O, yes. They get good wages?" "Yes, von pig much tollars." I had my trunk sent to my new quarters, then took a leisurely stroll through the "City of Pork." ; I first called on my friend Major J. P. Kline, on Sixth street, and before I left him, he made me promise to accompany him to the theater that night, stating that Proctor was to play the tragedy of "Virginius," at the I-forget-the-name-of-it Theater. I then took a further walk, and in a couple of hours returned to my lodgings and wrote a letter to an eastern paper, in which I gave a great deal of valuable information concerning Cin- cinnati-considering my limited knowledge of it. I accompanied my friend to the theater that even- ing, and saw Proctor play "Virginius." He performed hs part well; but there was one actor, of lofty mien, who personated Icilius in the tragedy, and who attracted my attention and won my admiration more than any other. He was perfectly majestic.   CINCINNATI.        201 I thought he should have been born a king, at least. He uttered every word with a loftiness and dignity, and in clear, ringing, impressive, awe-inspiring tones, that would have graced an emperor. Every word he uttered he seemed to feel; and whenever he was on the stage, I fancied I was looking on the genuine Icilius, himself, and on those real tragic events that occurred in the days of the Decemviri; instead of a mere representation of them. Virginius was cheered, applauded, encored; but Icilius more than " brought down the house." When he came out with the eloquent and brilliant passages which it was his office to repeat, the effect was electri- cal. The audience was dumb with admiration, and seemed ready to rise up in the air on the wings of en- thusiasm, bear Icilius to the skies, and have him en- rolled among the gods I That night, on reaching my " apartments " on Plum street, (having loitered by the way,) I observed that the ground-floor room I mentioned was lighted, and that its occupants were at home. As I entered the hall and closed the street-door behind me, I observed that the room-door stood wide open; and I heard voices within. One of them, who was standing at the center of the room, adjusting the gas-burner, just then vexed- ly exclaimed to his companion: "Pshaw! Gol-darn it, Bill! Where's me pipe?" Wondering if a  person so harsh-spoken could be one of the actors mentioned by the landlady, I in- voluntarily glanced in, as I walked past the' door toward the hall-stairs. The Gface of the speaker, who continued to growl about " me pipe," was toward the    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6734-00000104"/> 202    JOHN SIITH ON A CRUTCH. door, and the glare of several gas-burners shone full upon his visage. Ye mythic gods! Ye gods, Grecian and Roman! Ye gods, from great Jupiter down to the nude little cuss with the bow and arrows, inclusive! It was Icilius! Where now his gallant bearing-his majes- tic mien-his glittering armor-his proud helmet- his waving plume-and the burnished sword I had seen him flourish, as though it were a king's scepter? Where!! Where, too, was that noble look of defi- ance with which he had confronted Claudius Appius? Where that expression of more than mortal anguish -that had settled upon his god-like face when beautiful Virginia, loved Virginia, his Virginia, was slain with a butcher-knife by her own father, to avert dishonor? All gone! Gone!! "Dash it, then, give me a cigar," I heard him say, as I passed the door. He was in his shirt-sleeves, his shirt was unbut- toned at the collar, and carelessly thrown open to let the air in upon his manly breast, after his exertion; and, instead of the "raven locks" he had worn that night, his head was covered with short, stiff, reddish hair-lodc7s not so easily broken. Still, in his eyes, features, and voice, with all his change of dress and bearing, I recognized Icilius!"How are the mighty fallen!"Was it for him I had that night stamped, clapped my hands, and screamed "Encore?" I felt small, and said, to myself, "Icilius! Hcili-us! I silly ass! To think how I yelled, cheered, and en- cored this night for such a worm as thou!"I then went up to my room, resolving never to applaud an   CINCINNATI.       203 actor again, without knowing him to be a "star." It is perfectly safe then, for we seldom see them in dis- habille. Next day Major Kline and I visited a pleasant resort on the river shore, several miles above the city, known as "Ohmer's Zoological Gardens." "Pete" Ohmer, the proprietor, was a friend of Major Kline, and he cheerfully accompanied us through his pleasant grounds, showed us the numerous animals which he had on exhibition, and explained their pe-: culiarities. They were all in cages, because some of them were dangerous, while the others might run away. He had one " gentle" bear that was a perfect pet, and would fondle upon one like a dog. (That sentence is ambiguous. I do not mean that he would fondle upon one who was like unto a dog, (the son of a female dog,) but that he would fondle in a manner similar to that of that sagacious animal.) I put my hand in his mouth, and he playfully closed on it with his excellent teeth, just enough to make the blood come: no more. After that, I patted him affectionately on the head and left the cage. As I did so, he left the marks of his teeth on my crutch, and growled a pleasant "good-by." Another cage we visited contained an animal which I thought looked fully as good-natured as the pet bear. What animal is this, Mr. Ohmer?"I asked, as I walked up to the cage, and was about to thrust my hand through the bars and pat the gentle-looking creature on the head.    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6734-00000105"/> 204    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. ("That is the Cal---- Look out Don't put your hand in I Were you going to?" "Yes: he looks so pleasant, and----" "O it's 11cll you didn't. You think him a good- natured fellow, eh? That's what we call a Califor nia Tiger. Watch me stir him up, if you think him a pleasant fellow.7' He picked up an iron rod, thrust it into the cage, between the bars, and gave the creature, which had &amp;he honor to hail from California, an abrupt poke on the ribs. The result fairly startled me. The animal, which had appeared as docile as a kitten a moment before, now sprang up, uttered a growl as fierce as thunder only ten yards distant, dis- played a mouthful of sharp white teeth an inch long, and fastened upon the iron rod with its savage jaws. At the same time its eyes glared like balls of fire, and seemed ready to dart out at me. Al- together, the savage creature looked as though it could bite a man's leg off without noticing that there was a bone in it. "What if you had put your hand in?" said Major Kline. "It would have bit it off, I suppose," I returned; "and I couldn't well afford to lose it." "Yes," said Pete Ohmer, "he could snap your hand off in a second, and eat it up; and it would only give him an appetite to eat the rest of you." I could not help congratulating myself on my narrow escape, and resolved never to trust my hand to an unknown animal, merely because I liked its gentle appearance.   FALLS CITY AND CAVE CITY.    205 CHAPTER    XXIX. :ALLS    CITY AND  FAVE  CITY. ARLY in May, I left Cincinnati and went to Louisville, Kentucky, one hundred and fifty miles down the river. I took passage on a splen- did steamer-one of the finest on the Ohio or Missis- sippi. The fare was only two dollars, and each pas- senger was furnished with two excellent meals by the way, and a state-room berth when night came. It will naturally be thought that this was remarkably cheap; and so it was. But it was the result of com- petition. "Opposition" boats were at that time run- ning between Cincinnati and Louisville, and the fare -usually four or five dollars-had crawled down to two. Certainly "Competition is the life of trade." This, however, does not quite equal, for extreme consistence, the rates of fare on the Hudson river boats some years ago, when an  "Opposition line" from New York to Albany was established. The distance from New York to Albany is about the same as that from Cincinnati to Louisville; and the fare got lower and lower, at one period, till any weary traveler could go from New York to Albany--or vice versa- for twelve cents--meals not included. Nor did the freaks of competition end then. One of the lines, at    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6734-00000106"/> 206     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. last, concluding that the difference between twelve cents and nothing was but a mere trifle, reduced the fare twelve cents, and carried passengers a week or two for nothing. Not to be outdone, the other line not only carried all for nothing, but promptly paid e Lch passenger a premium of six cents for riding from one place to the other. It will be naturally supposed that they could not make much at such rates, but it is said that the number of passengers was so great that they did a better business then than they had done when the fare was two-and-a-half dollars. Louisville is the largest city in Kentucky-its population being now about ninety thousand. It is a great tobacco market, and has some of the most extensive warehouses, for the storage of that weed, in the United States. The principal business street in the city is called Main street, and it is one that would do no discredit to any city. It is wide, perfectly straight, about four miles lontg, and is lined with fine large buildings occupied by merchants. A well-con- ducted passenger railway is laid on this street. Louisville is also called the "Falls City," because the Ohio river there takes a considerable fall, so that steamboats, except at high water, are compelled to pass through a canal with several locks. The Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, are not abrupt, but extend twith a gradual descent, over two or three miles. Oppo- site Louisville is the town of Jeffersonville, Indiana; and three miles below, on the Indiana side, is the city of New Albany, with a population of about sixteen thousand. Of course I visited those places. From Louisville I determined to go on a visit to   FALLS CITY AND CAVE CITY.    207 the celebrated Mammoth Cave, a very considerable and extraordinary hole in the ground, situated about half-way between Louisville and Nashville-that is to say, nearly one hundred miles from each place. I was informed at the Falls City, that I should take the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and get off at Cave City, whence I should take a stage for the Mammoth Cave, ten miles from the railroad. Leaving my trunk at my hotel in Louisville, I took the five o'clock evening train, and arrived at Cave City-a small'village that isn't a city at all-by reasonable bedtime, where I retired to rest for the night in a good but rather expensive hotel. I was put in a double-bedded room with another passenger from Louisville, who also intended to visit the Mam- moth Cave next day. The clerk having conducted us to our room, with- drew from the chamber and closed the door after him. "I wonder if there is a lock on the door?" said my companion. "There ought to be," I replied. "We should se- cure it by some means, at all events." "Yes," he remarked, "I always make it a rule, when traveling, to see that every thing is secure.- Yes, here is a lock and bolt," he said, as he walked to the door and examined it. He turned the key and shot the bolt. "Are you going to the Cave to- morrow?" "Yes, that is my object." "Did you come on the train from Louisville?" "Yes; did you.?"    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6734-00000107"/> 208    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH.           I Yes, I too. I am from Missouri: and you?"- "I am from Pennsylvania ."  "Were you engaged in the war?"          i "Yes." "Federal side, I suppose." "Yes; and were you also-" "Confederate." "Exactly. Well, we are fellow-citizens and country- men once more, and let us congratulate each other that the strife is over. If you are going in the stage in the morning, we will be traveling compan- ions, and, I am sure, will prove agreeable to each other, notwithstanding that we have been fighting in opposing armies, and possibly shooting at each other." "I agree with you," he replied, " and was about to make such a remark myself.  True soldiers never carry animosities home with them, when the contest on the field is over." My Confederate companion was a young man of prepossessing appearance, twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, intelligent, affable and polite; and, as the lamp was extinguished and we retired to our respective beds in opposite corners of the room, I congratulated myself on my prospect of having an agreeable com- panion to join me in my visit to the Mammoth Cave on the morrow. Nor was I mistaken. My new ac- quaintance proved to be all that he appeared-a per- fect gentleman. With a confidence I seldom feel while a stranger is sleeping in the same room with me, I fell asleep, and enjoyed a good night's rest, after my ride on the train from Louisville.   ABSENCE FROM THE F FACE OF THE EARTH. 209      i i i1r C HA PT E R  X-X X. JOHN  AMTH'S PBSENCE FlyIOM THE    JACE OF     1 THE   pARTH. * NkEXT morning, having taken breakfast, we got       ', j N into the coach, and departed for the Mammoth     i: Cave, which we reached after a not unpleasalant ride of ten miles, over a hilly and wooded country. It was one of the pleasantest days of the year, and the  :  conversation between my companion and myself was      I of such an agreeable nature, that when we reached      -the hotel near the cave, I fancied we had scarely tra- veled half-a-dozen miles. The length of time we had    i7 been on the road, however, indicated that we must      . have traveled fully ten miles. It was about ten      I o'clock.                          'j We each paid two dollars for the services of a guide;  ij and the latter providing three lanterns, and some ;- combustible material for temporary lights at certain    ii particular points, accompanied us into a deep valley    :rI near by: and in this valley, in so obscure a place as   : I to be almost hid from the eyes of men, we found the   i:  entrance to the renowned Mammoth Cave.  It is not my intention to give a general description of it. Many a  graphic account of the great cave has I been furnished by tourists; and yet, as in the case pof Niagara Falls, no one has ever given an adequate     1.    <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6734-00000108"/> 210    J01IN SMITI  ON A CRUTCH. description, and no one can form any proper concep- tion of it withoumt having seen it. Hlowever, I'll mention a point or two that may prove interesting or amusing to the " gentle reader." Once within the cave,-which we entered without striking our "brows" on the overhanging rocks at the entrance, where a little cascade sings away its happy life-the guide lighted the three lamps he car- ried. It is customary to give one to each visitor, on entering the cave; but as I could not have carried one conveniently, the guide, having given one to my Con- federate friend, carried two himself. We then walked on, following a straight and nar- row passage for a quarter of a mile; by which time we began to feel quite independent of the sun. It would be natural to suppose that dampness would predominate in this cave, but such is not the case. On the contrary, quite the opposite state of things prevails. Except near the subterranean streams, the cave, both over-head and under-foot, is as dry as one could wish the paper on which he writes-and you know that isn't sloppy. The temperature of the atmosphere within the cave, at all seasons of thee year, is about fifty-nine degrees; and chemists have decided that the air is purer there  than without-that it contains a far less proportion of carbonic acid gas. The first point to whiclh the guide respectfully di- rected our attention-for he was very polite-was a place called the "Rotunda," situated at the first turn of the passage-or rather at the junction of this pas- sage with another runningl off toward the left, nearly   ABSENCE FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. 2" at a right angle. The "ceiling " of this "Rotunda"-- so-called from its resemblance to the interior of a dome-is about one hundred feet high, and eighty feet in diameter. Over the floor are still strewn some of the wooden pipes, used by the miners in 1812, at which time saltpeter was taken from the cave in large quantities. Turning to the left, we soon passed a small stone hut, and, somewhat surprised, we asked the guide what it ftidant to see a building thus far under ground, half-a-mile from the light of the sun. "That," said he, " and another similar one, which we shall soon pass, were built ten or fifteen years ago, for residences for consumptive patients, who, it was thought, would be benefited by the mild and regular temperature of the air." "And is it possible that any came in here to live, and thus shut themselves up, from the light of day," I asked. "Yes," returned the guide, "a number tried the experiment." "And with what result?" asked my companion. "Not a very satisfactory one. Several of them died in here, and never saw the sun again; while nearly all who lived to be taken out, died within a week or two after. When they reached the light again, it was discovered that all their eyes were per- fectly black, no matter what their original color had been." This fact, my friend and I silently doubted; but subsequent inquiry convinced us that it was true. Any- person who desires black eyes can acquire    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6734-00000109"/> 212    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH.          J them by a residence of a few months in the Mam- moth Cave. If any of my lady readers are afflicted with eyes of celestial blue, and are tired of them, they can have them promptly dyed black by taking apartments for three months in the Mammoth Cave. I don't advise them to do it, though, for HJohn Smith is but mortal-have a weakness for blue eyes that I cannot overcome. A few hundred yards from the Rotunda, the pas- sage widens out into a spacious apartment, styled the "Methodist Church." It is so-called because a con- gregation of Methodists used to hold "divine services" there. A good idea; for if they were a little noisy in their adorations, they did not disturb any one; and their prayers could as easily ascend through the two hundred feet of earth above them, as through a slate roof, with a tall spire to point out the way. A little further on we saw a huge rock which had evidently at some time or other fallen from above-- I mean from the roof of the cave--which, to look at it from a certain position, is a most perfect semblance of a coffin. It is termed the "Giant's Coffin," as the guide informed us. It is forty feet long, twenty feet i wide and eight feet deep. It would make a good sarcophagus to bury some great politician in, some day. Just beyond, the guide called our attention to some huge figures on the ceiling above. They represented the outlines of several persons of immense size. He informed us that they were styled the "Giant, his Wife and Child ;" and I just wondered, but didn't ask him, if they were to be put in the "Giant's Coffin,"   ABSENCE FROM THE ACE OF THE EARTH. 2131 when they should die? These figures had been formed by some dark substance that had apparently oozed from the rocky roof. Soon after passing them, we emerged into another spacious apartment, called the "Star Chamber." It is so called, because the ceiling, which is there of a dark hue, is covered with white spots; and when we gazed upon it for a moment, in the meager light of the lanterns, it looked like the mighty heavens studded with stars. l Now," said the guide, "sit down on those rocks there a little while, and I will take all the lamps and retire into a recess, where you cannot see a single beam of them. You can then see what perfect dark- ness is." We sat down, and the guide, taking all the lamps, walked away, descended into a kind of pit, and dis- appeared in a small sub-cavern; and every ray of light soon vanished. The darkness was indeed perfect; and it occurred to me that if a man intended to remain in such a position, he might as well have his eyes sewed up and covered with black sealing-wax. Neither my companion nor myself spoke. The darkness was so absolute, and the silence so profound that strange thoughts came into my head. I thought of the busy world without-fancied I saw the throng- ing multitudes of all the cities and towns of the globe; and the moving men and women scattered over the broad land; the ships with their crews, tossing about over the breasts of the great oceans; and I asked my- self: "Does the eye of the great unknown, incompre- hensible, Almighty Being who created and who, gov-    <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6734-00000110"/> 214    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCtH. erns the Universe, take note of all these, and still peer into this silent and secret place?"       i "There is a light i" exclaimed my companion, after ! a minute or so of black darkness and grave-like silence. Silence? No--all the while I had heard the beating of my own heart, although I was almost un- conscious of it as I sat musing, and the very absence of sound caused a singular imaginary ringing in my ears that I had never experienced before. I looked and saw our guide approaching from a different direction. He had traversed a small passage not known to visitors, and emerged from it some forty yards distant. "Now, gentlemen," said the guide, when he reached us again, "I am ready to accompany you further." "I presume we will see the ' Bottomless Pit,' by anld by," observed my Confederate friend, as we arose. "Yes," returned the guide, while we walked on. "That is a mile from here. We will pass over it." "And the river Styx," said H" where is it?" "About two miles from here," responded the guide. The nonchalance with which the guide would speak of miles of distance in the cave was very remarkable. He would say of such and such a point, "Why, that is two-and-a-half (or three or five, as the case might be,) miles from here," just the same as one in the out- side world would say, "You will find the Cross-roads about two miles from here;" or, "The village is just four miles distant." I remember his once telling us that some point-I forget what-was "five miles from here." Five miles underground! Think of it.   ABSENCE FROM THE PACE OF THE EARTH. 215 However,'that is not the extreme., Persons who go in to spend the whole day, travel as far as nine miles from the entrance. We only went three or four miles from the entrance that day, but we visited a great many intermediate passages, etc.; so that we probably traveled ten miles in the aggregate. In half-an-hour, after having seen many curiosi- ties by the way, we reached the celebrated "Bottom- less Pit." - Much curiosity regarding this pit prevails among those who have only heard it spoken of: therefore, I will remark that its very name is a contra- diction in terms. A pit, in order to be bottomless, must have no bottom at all; but this pit has one bottom, in a very good state of preservation, and, therefore, can- not be bottomless. If the word bottomless is an ad- je'ctive of the comparative order, I would say of the "Bottomless Pit;" "The'r are no doubt bottomlesser pits in the world than it is, but it is the bottomlessest pit I ever saw." Directly over the Pit is constructed a wooden bridge, which-for every thing is named there-is called the "Bridge of Sighs." It might be termed -the "Bridge of rather small Size," for'it is not much wider than a darkey's foot. We stepped upon this structure--which the guide assured us was perfectly safe-and stood directly over the center of the yawning pit. While we stood there he lighted a piece of peculiar paper he carried with him for the purpose, and dropped it from the bridge. Away it went, glaring, flaring, blazing, fluttering, down; down, down, till it reached the bottom of the pit that has no bottom. I do not mean to make light    <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6734-00000111"/> 216    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. of it-in fact, it is too dark and gloomy to be made  i 9yqht of-for it is grand and terrible even as it is. Its depth is probably one hundred and fifty feet. It is round, like a well, and about twenty feet in diameter. Water a few inches deep stands silently on the bot- tom, and the loose stones-probably such as have been cast down from time to time-can be seen peeping above the surface. The guide showed us another pit called "Side- saddle Pit "-so named because to see into it one must thrust his head through a small aperture, the lower part of which is in shape very similar to a side-saddle. This pit is very little wider than an ordinary well, and is, we were informed, more than one hundred feet deep. Not far from this we arrived at a wide place in the subterraneous passage called "Revelers' Hall;" be- cause it is customary for visitors to stop there awhile, rest from their rambles and drink each other's, or somebody else's health-if they have anything to drink it with. I happened to have about my person * somewhere--say in the breast pocket of my coat, for example-a willow-encased receptacle containing a strong unmixed toddy, without water or sugar. I produced it, and my companion, the guide and I im- bibed all our healths, the healths of all other visitors, the healths of distant friends, the health of the owner, and finally of the Cave itself, with all its curiosities and wonders. If I had thought of it at the time, I, would, moreover, have proposed Horne Tooke's regu- lar after-dinner sentiment: "All kings in h-1; the door locked, the key lost /"   ABSENCE FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. 217 We soon after visited the river "Styx," which, unlike the Styx of mythology, we can cross without arriving in Erebus. We went over it on a natural bridge of rock, with a single arch through which the dark river flows, and found the other shore about the same as this-either being gloomy enough to repre- sent Erebus, on a small scale. We descended to the water's edge on the opposite shore, and embarked in a small boat, which the guide propelled with a long pole, and rode a few hundred yards on the bosom of ithe awful stream. As we went gliding along through those gloomy passages that' frown in everlasting- silence, our figures barely seen in the dim light of the lamps, and the black walls grumbling at each sound, and echoing it back and forth, I thought that nothing in the depths of the earth could be more like the fabled mythic river over which Charon ferries his passengers to Hades. Certainly, the subterra- nean stream could -not have been more appropriately named. In some places we passed under dark arches that hovered over us so closely that they seemed ready to close upon us and crush us in their dismal grasp; and in other places we passed through narrow passages, where there was no path on either shore, and we were hemmed in on both sides by perpendicular walls of sombre rock. The stream is from twenty to fifty feet wide, and is not very deep, except in some noted places. The guide assured us that it is inhabited by fish without eyes. I have heard doubts expressed on this point, but there can be no reasonable doubt about it.

What material eye could penetrate the     a awful gloom?                     e NWhile gliding leisurely down the dusky river, the guide struck up a song; and whether his voice was sonorous or not, or the words beautiful, I thought I had never heard anything sound so majestically mu- sical. The dim dark walls took up the words and echoed them again and again; and they rolled along    the passages, like half-tamed thunder, and returned to us again from remote pits and recesses.      ! O what's the use for humble John Smith to at- tempt to describe those scenes of awful and gloomy grandeur! Let me desist, and escort the reader from the grandly dismal labyrinths, the yawning pits and frowning recesses, to the bright day again! As we go toward the entrance I will mention a few other things that I saw. The guide conducted us intob an avenue-I forgot what he called it: some "arcade," I think-which was adorned with innumerable stalac. tites and stalagmites, and many grand columns that seemed placed there to support the ceiling, which had been formed by the meeting and blending to- gether of stalactites and statagmites. The stalactites form like icicles. They are carbonate of lime, i e., limestone. The carbonate of lime, mingled with some other chemical substance, has oozed froln the ceiling, and, as the other substance leaves, it hardens into suspending columns, as water freezes into icicles when the cold air carries away the caloric from it. In one place, four columns arise in a kind of cluster, so that one can stand among them. They constitute what is termed the "Altar." The guide   ABSENCE FROM THE FACE: OF THE EARTH. 219 told us that a marriage ceremony was once performed there. A young lady had promised her mother during the- latter's dying moments, that she would "never get married on top o' ground;" but as time rolled on, and the dear creature concluded that it was not good to be alone, she and her " intended," accom- panied by a minister, entered the Mammoth Cave, repaired to this novel place, and were married under ground. Literally, she kept her promise, but scarce- ly in spirit. It looked like ('whipping the-' ould one-round the stump."  I do not censure her, though; nor should I, even if she had got married on the " cloud-capped " crest of Mount Hood; for, " a bad promise is better broken than kept." It was three o'clock when we emerged from the cave, and experienced the blinding influence of sud- denly returning daylight. Without delay we re- paired to the hotel and took dinner--for which we had acquired a good appetite-then got into a coach and returned to Cave City. My Confederate friend wanted to travel into Tennessee, and cordially bidding me good-by at Cave City, he left on an evening train. I had to wait till twelve o'clock for a train north- ward; and I passed the interim very agreeably, play- ing "All-fours" with an ugly gentleman who wore spectacles, and begged on three trumps. Although this work is no "Traveler's Guide," as I have mildly insinuated before, I will favor the reader with a tabular statement of the cost of visiting the Mammoth Cave, making Louisville the starting- point:    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6734-00000113"/> 220      JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH.

THE NIGHTINGALE.       221 CHAPTER    XXXI. THE  JIGHTINGALE. N the course of my stay in Louisville, I had the pleasure of an introduction to George D. Prentice, J Esquire, the well-known editor of the Louisville Journal; and I found him as agreeable and good- natured as he is witty. He was engaged in writing a scathing article denunciatory of Parson Brownlow, at the time my friend and I entered his sanctum, and was in excellent spirits. Perhaps no one of the many who have heard of the witty journalist, and read his writings, but have never seen him, has ever formed any correct impression of his personal appearance. He is quite homely, does     not look half as bright as he really. is, is noble- hearted, kind, affable, polite, and exhibits a partiality for grain products in a liquid form, at all seasons of the year. But this is nobody's business but his own. About the middle of May, or a little later, perhaps, I took passage on the steamer Nightingale, for Saint Louis. The steamer was a stern-wheel one, pretty well loaded, and did not make very fast time; but the weather was delightful, every thing on board was com- fortable and pleasant, and, as I was in no hurry, I    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6734-00000114"/> 222    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCII.  could not have complained if the journey had occu- pied a week.  Fellow passengers on board a steamer soon make  themselves acquainted with each other, and I had not  been aboard twenty-four hours before the faces of all were as familiar to me as though I had known them for years. With but few exceptions they were agree- able persons. The captain was a handsome man of twenty-eight or thirty, and one glance at him was enough to convince any one that he was a true gen- tleman. All the attaches of the boat, including the bartender and porter, were just what they should be.- Among the passengers was a fellow of twenty- seven or twenty-eight, who called himself a Doctor. He told me he was from New York, and was going to Saint Louis to establish a practice for himself. "I don't care," said he, "whether I am successful at first or not. I have five thousand dollars in my pocket, and that will keep me a year or so without my doing much. By that time, 'll get myself worked into a practice, no doubt." "Certainly," I agreed. He was not a fine-looking man, but he was ob- viously a vain fool, and one whom I thought I should not like to trust further than I could throw a comet by the tail. Every one called him "Doctor," and he seemed to like it. I will say more of him by and by. The sharer of my state-room-he occupied the lower berth-was a venerable man of eighty years, a native of Missouri. He was a man of finished educa- tion, and, by profession, a physician. He and I were so much pleased with each other, that we have since ,   THiuE NIGHTINGALE.      223 corresponded; and I have found his acquaintance truly edifying, as well as agreeable. His name was Crele.  Dr. Crele told me a sad tale of his troubles in Missouri during the war. He resided in Lafayette county, of that State, where old feuds held carnival during the desolating civil war. He had taken no part in the contest, in any way, he told me; and he said that his nearest and best friend on earth had lately been an only son of thirty years-whom he pictured to me as all that was manly, noble, pure, honorable, and worthy of a parent's fond affection. This son, he said, had studied for the ministry, had acquired a rare education, and, like himself, had taken no part in the war. But one bitter night, when he himself was seriously ill, and his son was sitting by his bedside, a party of armed men, headed by an old enemy of his family, abruptly burst into his house, and shot down that son-the last prop of his old age. One of the reckless and deluded men was going to shoot him, as he lay in bed, but another in- terrupted him, saying: "Never mind the old white-headed'reprobate.. It isn't worth while. He'll soon die, anyhow." So, sparing him a few dim years of bitterness, they ransacked the house, carried off all the valuables they could find, damaged much of the furniture, set the building on fire, and departed. The flames were ex- tinguished by friendly neighbors, who came to his assistance, and who lifted up from a pool of blood the lifeless form of his son. There were tears in the old man's eyes as he told " -I     <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6734-00000115"/> 224    JOHN SMITH ON A' CRUTCH. me this; and no wonder. His hair was white, his hand trembled, and his step was unsteady with age. He must have felt alone in the world. I will not state which cause the villains professed to be attached to, who murdered the Doctor's son, and left him a blank and desolate old age. There were wrongs and outrages committed on both sides during the war. No reasonable person will fail to admit this. A civil war gives a horrible license to bad men; and God forbid that our land should ever be blighted by another. Gambling was not allowed on board the Nightingale, but there was a good deal of euchre-playing, for amusement, during the voyage. At Evansville, In- diana, a flourishing town of eight thousand inhabi- tants, we landed for half-an-hour, and, while there, several passengers came aboard; among them was a well-dressed young man, with what I considered a, bad countenance. He had cold, gray, almost expression- less "windows" for his "soul," to look out at, a smooth, beardless face, and a mouth with an unusually crescent-like shape. This person had not been aboard very long-ia fact, the boat had barely backed away from the land- ing and begun to move on down the river, when he suggested to a green-looking fellow that they should get up " a little four-harded game of euchre-just for amusement." Mr. Greeney assented; and inducing two other passengers to join them, they began to while away the time, as we glided down the river," passing," "talcking it up," "turning it down," "ordering it up," "assisting, "making it," "going it alone," and the-   THE NIGHTINGALE.

"Why," rejoined Mr. Greeney, with a frankness that spoke better for his heart than his head "I just wish it was poker!" "Why?" asked Mr. Sharper. "Because, I'd bet some-" "Well," suggested Mr. Sharper, with a careless yawn, "we might get up a little bet on our hands, anyhow, just to pass away the time. I've felt dull for the last half-hour, I'd risk something on my hand, if I were sure of losing. But I warn you, it is not a bad hand. Have you all any thing like poker hands? Come: a pair of deuces- " "I haven't," said his left-hand man,interrupting him,. "Nor I," said his left-hand-man's partner, who sat on his right. "Well, darned if I haven't, though," said Mr. Greeney. "Have you, really?" responded Mr. Sharper. "Well, I'll bet five dollars on my hand, win or lose." And he carelessly threw upon the table a crumpled five-dollar bill, which he took from his vest pocket. Mr. Greeney got a little excited at this demonstra- tion, laid his cards on the table, faces downwards, of course, thrust his hand deep into his right- hand trousers pocket, and nervously drew forth his pockethook. "I'll cover your five dollars, and go five dollars better," he said, with firmness, as he laid down a ten- dollar bill. Who wouldn't have ventured something on four e       ............. .-Ji.    Z( kings--next to the best hand in the pack--that had thus come out by chance, while playing euchre for amusement? "You do?" said Mr. Sharper, glancing up and down the cabin. "Now, the captain wouldn't allow- however, he isn't about. I didn't think of risking more than five dollars, but I guess you are trying to bluff me. I'll not back out. Here's fifteen dollars more, and that makes the bet twenty." And he pro- duced the amount specified. "Ten dollars better still" said Mr. Greeney, promptly, as he laid down twenty dollars. It was quite clear he had played poker before. Mr. Sharper hesitated. Thirty dollars," said he. I-no, confound it!-I'll put fifty on the top of it and that's all I will risk!-No-or, yes; ve said it now, and will stick to it. It won't make me a bank- rupt, if I do lose." Thereupon, he produced three twenty dollar bills ayd laid them on the table-making the bet eighty dollars. "I call you," said Mr. Greeney, eagerly, as he counted out five ten-dollarbills and threw them down upon the table. "Four aces," said Mr. Sharper, as he smilingly dis- played the hateful four that can't be beat. "What have you?"  What could he have, in a case of that kind "Only four kings   Darn the luck!" poor Mr. Greeney exclaimed, in unfeigned vexation. Then he said, "Pshaw!" "The deuce on it!" "I'll be!" and several other words, better and worse; while Mr. Sharper, with a calmness, complacence and benignity    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6734-00000117"/> 228    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. that one could not but admire, raked down the "pile," and stowed it away in his pocket. "Well, whose deal is it?" said Mr. Sharper, who seemed to devote no further thought to the trifle he had won.  They finished that game of euchre-for amuse- ment-then 'Mr. Greeney, with a most extraordinary expression of countenance, arose from his seat at the table, and, in a rather husky voice, said he believed he wouldn't play any more: he seemed to have lost all interest in the game: and he walked away whistling. Whistling? Yes. But, O, what a dull, dry sort of a whistle he made of it! The sudden loss of eighty dollars is not very elevating to the spirits of a person in moderate circumstances; and who can say what the poor dupe suffered? Notwithstanding all his at- tempts to appear unconcerned, and to emit a forced whistle, it was plain that he was suffering no ordinary mental torture. How remarkable it is, that when a man feels right bad, and don't want the fact made public, he tries to turn it off with whistling! There seems to be some- thing soothing in a strain or two of this species of music, if only executed with any skill; but a man who is suffering inward "pangs," can rarely get the right " pucker" on his lips. Poor Mr. Greeney made a miserable whistle of it, and if he had wept aloud for his lost cash, he could not have more clearly ex- hibited his anguish to the unsympathizing spectators. The game being ended, Mr. Sharper purchased a good cigar at the bar, lighted it, and, taking an arm- chair out upon the cabin deck, seated himself, rested    his polished boots on the railing, and laid back in his chair, quietly smoking, and at the same time regard- ing the picturesque shores of the river, with a calr- ness and self-satisfaction that must have been agoniz. ing for poor Mr. Greeney to look at. When the Captain learned what had happened in the cabin, he went to Mr. Sharper, and told him he must leave the boat at Cairo, as soon as a landing could be conveniently effected, as he could not tolerate a gambler on his boat. Mr. Sharper coolly replied that heb had not intended to go further than Cairo, anyhow; but, if he had- The Captain interrupted him with a friendly warn- ing against any thing bordering on defiance or inso. lence. He remarked that he had not picked a black- leg or thief up by the neck and heels, and pitched him into the river, for nearly a year, and that he was be- ginning to feel marvelously like taking a bit of such exercise; and that he would assuredly do so, if so much as one more articulate sound should escape him (Mr. Sharper). The latter appreciated the warning, and during the remainder of his stay on board the Nightingale, maintained a commendable silence. At Cairo, where the Ohio river empties into the Mississippi, we landed, and laid for a couple of hours, before proceeding up the broad Mississippi; and Mr. Sharper promptly left us. Cairo is a city of about twelve thousand inhabi- tants, and but for the unhealthy nature of the low country surrounding, it would eventually become one of the greatest cities of the Mississippi Valley. Its geographic location is one of the best in the country, , 'I -- . ..    <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6734-00000118"/> 230,    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. being, as it is, at the junction of two noble rivers. But in that vicinity, the land is so low that it becomes inundated for many miles around; so that the air, especially in the summer season, becomes fraught with miasma. Cairo itself is built on very low ground, and but for the high levee, that stands as a perpetual sentinel before the gates of the city, the river would be continually staring in at all the doors and windows in the place. Even the levee is overflowed sometimes, and the streets become navigable for boats of mode- rate size. I went up to a periodical store, on the principal street, and purchased several newspapers of a late date. Among them was a Louisville Journal; and, on casting my eye over it, what was my astonishment to run across a very flattering notice of myself, which Mr. Prentice had inserted. It stated that "J. Smith, Esquire, the celebrated author and poet, who had lost a limb in the civil war, was making a tour of the Western States; had honored both him and the Mam- moth Cave with a visit, and had just departed for Saint Louis, on board the steamer Nightingale!!!" This really alarmed me, and I fancied that every one who looked at me recognized me as the redoubta- ble John Smith, the "celebrated author and poet," who was 'L making a tour of the Western States." Fearing that some enthusiastic demonstration might be made by the citizens of Cairo, who had probably read of my approach, and that I might be called upon for a speech-and I hadn't as much as the framework of one ready-I hastily returned to the boat, and shut myself up in my stateroom, and did not sally forth   THE NIGHTINGALE.      231 again till the Nightingale was steaming gallantly up the Mississippi. Nothing worthy of note occurred during our voyage up the river, except that the mosquitoes tormented us in a style entirely new to me. They were about the first crop of the season, fresh and vig- orous, and they attacked the boat in numbers amount- ing to millions of millions. O, the misery of that night I How the little fiends tormented me! Warm as it was, I shut myself up almost air-tight in my stateroom and tried to defy them. I thought I would rather be smothered to death than eaten up alive. But even there they found me. They came in through the keyhole, in two ranks, military order, and at once began the attack. I fought bravely, but it was of no use. Faster than I could cut them down, they received reinforcements through the keyhole-while, to utterly dishearten me, and drive me to despair, I could hear myriads of them still without, knocking at the door, and impatiently waiting their respective turns to file in at the keyr-hole and drink some of me. I could not stand it. I opened the back door and fled-fled to the cabin deck-to the hurricane deck-- to the boiler deck--up stairs and down-and down and up-and back and forth, and forth and back, half crazed-I knew not, cared not, where! I had half a mind to jump into the river, and take refuge from these and Ty other woes in the bosom of the Father of Waters-but didn't. They pursued me everywhere; some of them, I believe, went in advance of me, to be ready to meet me at any newe point I should flee to. My eyes, cars,    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6734-00000119"/> 232    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. mouth, nose, cheeks, chin, neck, hands and wrists were covered with them ; and, while thus tormenting me, they sang musically in my ears, even as Nero played "Hail Columbia, happy land l" on a banjo, while Rome was burning. O, the agonies of that night! The thundering cannon of battle, the shriek- ing shell, the hissing bullet, and glistening bayonet, are mere toys compared with these fiendish tor- remtors! How I ever got through the night I cannot remember distinctly. It seems like a kind of long-con- tinued dream to me. I have a vague recollection of standing at the bar and asking the bar-tender if he had " anything calculated to keep the mosquitoes away?"This scene recurs to me as having been re- peated several times that night; but I think it only originated in the imagery of delirium-for I must have grown delirious. The next night, for some reason, they " let up" on us a little, and I got some sleep; and early on the second morning after leaving Cairo, we arrived at the "Mound City," Saint Louis, the chief city of the Mis- sissippi Valley. It was a charming morning, not too warm, and leaving my trunk on board, I walked up into the city for the purpose of securing lodgings for a month. Before I did so, the passengers had all bid each other good-by, and were-beginning to go their different ways, w"ondering if any two of us should ever meet again. My aged companion bade me a cordial farewell, and took passage on the steamer L"Post Boy," bound up the Missouri river. The vain young "Doctor," whom I have mentioned,   THE NIGHTINGALE.       233 went to the Southern Hotel--one of the grandest and most aristocratic in the country--and registered his name, stating that he would remain a couple of weeks. That I may not be troubled to speak again of so worthless a fellow, I will here state, that, a week after, I met another fellow-passenger in Saint Louis, who told me that the "Doctor" had stayed four days at the -Southern Hotel, and then absconded without paying his bill. This most pretentious and presumptuous of the passengers of the Nightingale, proved to be an unworthy loafer and a base fraud.

SMITH'S EXTRAOFDINARY   ADVENTURES IN THE  ii]WOUND FITY." yTX TE had landed at the foot of Pine street, which I followed directly up into the city. I was just about to cross Third street, when my attention was irresistibly attracted to a very beautiful girl of eighteen, who came walking down Third, on the lower side, and turned to cross and go up Pine street but a few feet in advance of me. I was just thinking how happy a man her husband would be, in case she should ever take it into her head to get one, when, as she reach- ed the opposite corner, a man standing in the door of a periodical store near the corner, called to his dog, which had strayed across the street. The dog was a fine, large, sleek, spotted, good-natured, intelligent- looking fellow, dressed in a burnished brass collar. He wore a pleasant smile on his sagacious face, and looked as though he wouldn't harm a flea that was biting him. With all the ready obedience of the faithful animal, hecame bounding toward his master just as the young lady in question arrived opposite the door. It appeared that she had not observed the ownler of the dog, or heard him call to his property; and seeing the animal come bouncing toward her, she   ADVENTURES IN THE "MOUND CITY.'"  235 naturally imagined that the sagacious creature was "going for" her-and how did she know but that he was afflicted with chronic hydrophobia? On the im- pulse of the moment, she uttered a musical scream, whirled around to rush back across Third street, and came in direct contact with me. It was so sudden, and unexpected, that the shock came near knocking wae down under a cart-wheel as the heavy vehicle went jogging by, near the curbstone; and, to make the matter worse, she slipped on a bit of orange-rind, and we came near falling down together, all mixed- up. To prevent this catastrophe, I instinctively clasped her waist in my encircling arms, while she, on the spur of the moment, threw her plump arms confidingly around my manly neck! And there we stood, at one of the most public street-corners of Saint Louis, unconsciously embracing, like two gen- tle lovers that hadn't seen each other for a month of Sundays. "O!   - O -O-o-oo-oo!" she exclaimed; ' excuse me! I was so afraid of that dog!" "He shall not hurt you," I gallantly replied, as I released her from my protecting arms, and picked up my cane, which had fallen in the confusion. "I declare!" she said, blushing confusedly,-I have always thought this was because she perceived that I was young and handsome-"I might have pushed you over! I'm sorry! Did I hurt you?" ", no!"I replied warmly, wondering at the same time whether she, meant she was sorry she hadn't pushed me over; "I was only anxious on your ac- I    <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6734-00000121"/> 236    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. count. I am happy that it was my privilege to save you from falling, when you slipped." "Thank you; but it wouldn't have hurt me. If you had fallen, though-and you-you"- She was going to allude to the trifling circum- stance that I lacked one of the usual number of legs, but, with some delicacy, hesitated. "O, it wouldn't have hurt me," I said, coming to her relief; "there isn't so much of me to fall now, and I, therefore, don't fall so hard as others." As we were both going up Pine street, we walked on, side by side, and I had the pleasure of her com- pany for four squares. We walked slowly, too. I could have walked four hundred squares, if she* had kept on; but when we reached Seventh street, she told me she lived just around the corner. There- upon, we bade each other an affectionate farewell and parted. I crossed Seventh street and walked about half way to Eighth, when, thinking that the young lady had had time to get out of sight, I retraced my steps. After I had gone a little way below Seventh, I des- cried a card on a door, containing the following notice: "FURNISHED ROOMS TO LET." I rang the door-bell, was soon shown in, and, stating that I desired a lodging-room for three or four weeks, was shown a neat, well-furnished room on the second floor, which the landlady said was worth five dollars a week, and would be very suita- ble for a gentleman and wife. I stated that I would occupy it alone, gave the landlady twenty dollars for   ADVENTURES IN "THE MOUND CITY."   237 four weeks' possession of the room, then went clown to the boat and sent my trunk up by an express wagon. I was again walking up Pine street, and once more crossing Third, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and a voice behind me exclaimed, "Why, Smith! is this you?" I turned, stating that it was-for I never ignored my proud name-and beheld a familiar face. It was that of one whom, I had known when a boy, but had not seen for some years. His history is somewhat re- markable. When I knew him in my youth, he was a young man of twenty years, and quite proverbial for his piety. He was often pointed out, to the profli- gate youth of the village I lived in, as a shining ex- ample of Christianity, and he was, in truth-or seemed-so sober, honest, and good, as to put ordi- nary young fellows to shame, by comparison. His name was Albert Hague. His occupation was that of salesman in a dry-goods store; and such confi- dence did he ever command, that his employers trusted him implicitly with everything about their stores-safe-keys, cash accounts, and the like. By and by, however, much to the astonishment and amazement of all who knew him, he actually stole ten thousand dollars from his employer, and ab- sconded. From that time forth, nothing, to my knowledge, had been heard of him in the old neigh- borhood; and this was the man I unexpectedly met in Saint Louis. Why, Bert!"I exclaimed, shaking hands with him-for I was truly glad to meet any familiar face    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6734-00000122"/> 238    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. in a strange city--" is this you? Where do you come from?" "I am living here," he said. "I saw you crossing the street, and did not know whether to hail you or not. I fancied that, after what you know of me, you would not speak to me." "Then you do not know me," I replied. "You never injured me, if you did commit a grievous offense. It is a great mistake to cast every one down as soon as he commits an error. It is no way to recover him. It only discourages him, and renders him indifferent about reforming.-I have just hired a room on Pine street. Come with me, and tell me all about it." We walked up Pine street, and were soon sitting in my room. There he told me all that had happened to him. He had eluded the law, and fled with his ill-gotten ten thousand dollars to California, where, he said, he saw no rest, day or night. He declared that when I knew him as a pious young man, he was all that he appeared to be; but said that, by and by, he began to be tempted to take advantage of'the ex- cellent opportunity he had to acquire a large amount of money; and, in an evil moment, yielded. He did not remain in California three weeks, he said, before his conscience compelled him to return to Pennsylvania and restore the ill-gotten cash to its owner; which, he said, he had recently done. He had now determined, he remarked, never to yield to temptation again, and was resolved to atone for, the past by a future life of integrity and uprightness; he now had a position as salesman in a wholesale house in Saint Louis, and was doing well. He gave   ADVENTURES IN "THE MOUND CITY.'9  239 me the name of the house, and asked me to call and see him. He remarked that he could freely confide in one who had so readily overlooked his former dis- grace. I replied that, as a matter of course, it would in- jure him for his employers to know his past history, that I believed he was sincere in his good resolution, and that he need not feel apprehensive that I should ever cast a stumbling-block in his way. The strictly "pious," with the blindness that too often characterizes "them, may censure mle for not warning his employers; but let them do so. Do they think, that when a man commits one crime, he is necessarily lost, forever? Suppose I should have regarded it as a duty to go to his employers and tell them what I knew of Hague? He would have been discharged at once, because they could never have relied on him. He would then have despaired of recovering from the effects of that one error; and no matter how good his intentions might have been, while his prospects were bright, he would, probably, have turned a rogue again, on the first opportunity, because he had no other alternative. It is a fearful mistake to thrust a man down at once, for his first crime, instead of taking him by the hand and lifting him up: it is that unchristian-like policy that fills our penitentiaries, and gives such frequent employment to the hangman.

"Compound for sins we are inclined to, By damning those we have no mind to,"- as Hudibras says. "There is none good: no, not one." We have all committed bad deeds, of some kind or other, whether they come within the pale of the law or not. If you demand strict justice, look to yourself. "Use every man after his desert," says Hamlet, "and who shall 'scape whipping?" My pious friends, remember that none of you are quite perfect. Remember, that if there is a God,- "And that there is, all Nature cries aloud!"-His eye is upon you; and if you cannot tolerate your fellow-creatures, simply because their sins happen to be of a different class from yours--imperfect though probably no worse-how can you expect Him to bear with you? I did not remove from Saint Louis for four weeks, and during that time made a number of little excur- sions into the interior of the state, and also into the state of Illinois, which lies on the east side of the river. I liked the "Mound City" very well. As it may not be generally known why Saint Louis is styled the "Mound City," I will state that it is because the ground on which it is built was once occupied by numerous artificial mounds, supposed to have been built by the Indians. It may not be out of place, either, to say a word regarding the pronunciation of the name of the city. I observed that all the citizens give it the old Fr'nch pronunciation--that is, Saint Loo-e--the final " s nlot   ADVENTURES IN "THE MOUND CITY."   241 being sounded. It should be so pronounced by all, as the citizens of a place are generally accepted as authority in such matters. I observed the same fact in Louisville, Kentucky. The citizens there pro- nounce it Lou-ee-ville. It would sound harsh to them to hear it pronounced as it is spelled--Lou-is- ville. The sibilant sound of the us" would make the drums of their ears quiver. I was not at first favorably impressed with the water in Saint Louis; but I soon became fond even of that. The water is taken from the Mississippi river, and is always very muddy. Let an ordinary bucketful of it stand awhile, and an inch of "mire" will settle on the bottom. This muddy state of the fluid is owing to the turbid Missouri river, which empties into the Mississippi twenty miles above Saint Louis. Chemically, however, this water has been pronounced, by scientific men, the purest in the country. It is said to be perfectly free from all deleterious minerals, and, when the mud is taken from it, is as nearly pure water as can be pro- duced. The fire arrangements in Saint Louis, as in most western cities, are very imperfect. While there, it was my luck one day-and I had had the same luck in Louisville, where I made the same observations- to stand in the immediate presence of a destructive fire, when it first broke out. A heavy volume of black smoke rolled up toward the blue sky, the flames burst out through roofs and windows, and leaped for, mad joy, walls crumbled down at their leisure, and I think that twenty-five minutes or half- 16 .    <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6734-00000124"/> 2412    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. an-hour elapsed before any steamer or hose-carriage made its appearance. I do not attach so much blame to the firemen themselves--although they are not so active as New York or Philadelphia firemen--as to the deficiency of the force. On this occasion I was told that the same firemen had been working all the afternoon, at a fire in a distant part of the city, and I could not wonder that they were a little tardy. Their force should be at least doubled-but I think they will realize this ere long. Louisville and Saint Louis are now fast recovering from the paralyzing effects of the recent unhappy war; they do not lack enterprise; and I predict that in a few years their arrangements for protecting property against the flames will be equal to those of the eastern cities.   HOW NOT TO OPEN A PATENT LOCK.   243 CHAPTER   XXXIII. OW NOT TO   PEN A JATENT JOCK. ISHNG to visit some portions of Iowa, I started up the Mississippi in June, on a boat running regularly betweei Saint Louis and Keokuk, an Iowa town or city with a population of eight thou- sand, situated at the mouth of the Des Moines river. It is two hundred and twenty-four miles above Saint Louis. Only one funny thing happened during my voyage from Saint Louis to Keokuk, and, probably, one of the parties concerned could not have been led to agree that even that was funny. It occurred during the day following our departure from Saint Louis, while the boat was lying at the landing at .Quincy, a city of twenty-five thousand souls, on the Illinois shore. The boat laid there for half an-hour; I know not what for, as no freight was being shipped or put ashore. During that brief half-hour, two sharpers came aboard. They were confederates, or "pals," but pretended not to know each other. In fact, one of them, whom I shall style Number One-although they were both number one rogues-came aboard a few minutes before the other, whom I shall call Number Two. He did not go up to the cabin deck,    <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6734-00000125"/> 244    JOHN SMITH 0N A CRUTCH. but stood on the boiler deck, talking with the deck- hands-most of whom were darkeys-and asking such questions as were calculated to convince any one that he was badly green. By and by, Number Two, Esquire, came aboard, carrying a kind of padlock in his hand, -and, with a  respectful manner, said to Number One. "My friend, can you tell me how soon this boat will go up the river?" ' No, sir"' replied Number One; 'I just came aboard." "She go up de riber in a little bit," put in one of the darkeys that were lounging idly about the bulk- head. "Thank'you," said Number Two, who appeared to be a perfect gentleman. He was walking up the steps leading to the cabin deck, when Number One called out: "Stranger-excuse me-but are you the gentleman I saw up in town with the new patent lock?" "Yes," returned Number Two, pausing on the stairs: "this is it." "Would you be kind enough to let me look at it?" "Certainly," returned Number Two, with an obliging air, as he descended the stairs. "Perhaps," suggested Number One, " you are in a hurry, and-" "O, no," replied Number Two; "not at all.. I intend to take passage on the boat, and I can go up to the office at any time and pay my fare." And he handed Number One the lock. "I believe I heard you say," observed Number   HOW NOT TO OPEN A PATENT LOCK.    245 One, as he began to inspect it, " that this is your own invention." "' It is," replied Number Two. "'Have you a patent for it?" "Yes, it was patented but lately." The deck-hands and several passengers, who hap- pened to be strolling about the lower deck, now collected around and gazed on the lock with curious eyes. "Did I understand you to say," queried Number One, " that no key is used to open the lock?" "Correct. No key is required, I can simply take it, shoot the ring-bolt into its place, and I'll bet any I man a hundred dollars that he can't open it." The spectators looked on with increased interest. "Lock it for me,'" said Number One, handing it back to the owner. "I would like to try it." "Certainly."  Number Two  took the lock- a spring-lock,'apparentlty-shot the bolt into its place, with a snap, and returned it to Number One. "There," said he, " you'll be the sharpest man I ever saw if you open it." The spectators now gathered around closer, and looked on with an interest that was intense. Number One took the lock, inserted his finger in the ring-bolt and took a dead pull on it. "It won't come open that way," he remarked, as he pretended to scan it more closely. "' No," replied Number Two; "you might as well pull against two yoke of oxen." Presently, Number One appeared to discover a slight,-almost imperceptible,-protuberance, which    <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6734-00000126"/> 246    JOHN SITH ON A CRUTCH. looked as though it might connect with a secret spring; and pressing this slyly, he opened the lock, and handed it back to Number Two, with an air of triumph. "There," said he; "when you invent another lock, bring it to me and I'll open it for you." A loud laugh went round at the expense of Number Two, who seemed-much disconcerted. "Ha, ha, ha," laughed an ebony deck-hand. "If all de locks was dat easy opened a fellah's prwopehty wouldn't be very safe." "You can't open it," retorted Number Two, a little irritated. "What'll you bet?" said darkey. "I'll bet a hundred dollars you can't," said Number Two, whom discomfiture seemed to have rendered reckless. "Will you bet me a hundred dollars that I can't open it?" asked Number One, boldly. "No," returned Number Two. "You have opened it once, and know how; or else I would. Why didn't you bet before you tried it? you would have won then." "I'm sorry I didn't now," said Number One. "O, pshaw 1" said the same darkey who had spoken before. "I seen how him opened it 1" "Well, you can't open it," retorted Number Two, banteringly. "An' will you bet me a hundred dollahs I can't?" said the darkey, on whose black face I could read enterprise. I happened to be sitting by the railing of the cabin   HOW NOT TO OPEN A PATENT LOCK.   247 deck just above, and could look down and witness the whole scene. "Why-I-yes-yes, I will," stammered Number Two, with well-feigned hesitation.  ' You'll lose then," Number One said, in a low tone, as though speaking to himself. "Will you put up de money?" pursed the darkey. "I-why wouldn't-yes, I will. I won't be backed out, even if I lose. I'll put up the money in the hands of this gentleman or any one else." When he said " this gentleman," he pointed to Number One. "You had better not trust me with the stakes," said the latter jocosely, "I might run off." "O, no fear of that," replied Number Two. "We'll trust you. I know a gentleman when I see one." "By golly!-H bet," said the darkey, decidedly. And he produced a fifty-dollar bill and some odd tens and fives amounting in all to one hundred dollars; and he handed the money to Number One, who was to act as stake holder. "Come, now," said another darkey, to Number Two, as the latter hesitated. "Don't back out. Put up your money." "Confound me if I'll be backed out!" he said, as he took out his pocket-book, counted out one hundred dollars and handed it to the stake-holder. O, that money was in precious hands! "Now," said the darkey, who had made up his mind to win or lose one hundred dollars, "fix de lock fur me.' Number Two " fixed " it. The darkey took it, and first, merely as a matter of    <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6734-00000127"/> 248    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH, form, took a pull at the ring-bolt. It would not open, of course. Well, no matter: he knew where that "secret spring " was. You bet! tHe easily found the little protuberance, and pressed on it with his thumb. But it wouldn't open. He pressed harder. No go. He pressed harder still, and pulled harder at the ring- bolt, at thp same time. Bootless. He pressed harder still and pulled harder still. Vain efforts. He got a little apprehensive and a little desperate. The sum of one hundred dollars was at stake. The lock must be opened. He inserted the ring-bolt between his white teeth, placed his thumb on the imaginary spring, and pulled and pressed, and pressed and pulled, with the energy of despair. The lock was firm: his efforts futile. A laugh now went round at the poor darkey's ex- pense; and he trembled, perceptibly, while his face assumed a sort of lead-color, with a greenish tinge. His thick lips also became quite void of moisture, and he spoke in a husky voice. "Dun'no-dun'no-wedder I kin open him or not." "I don't think you can," said Number Two, calmly. The poor darkey saw that his "stamps" were gone. Still, he tried it once more. He shook the lock-and something loose within rattled with a taunting sound, tapped it against the capstan, pulled at the bolt, pressed the delusive spring, pulled and pressed, again and again. All was in vain. He gave it up; but, O, with what a poor grace! and handed the lock to Number Two. "I b'lieve dah's som'in' wrong about it," said he. "It seems, I've won the money," Number Two ob. ,   EOW -NOT TO OPEN A PATENT LOCK.   249 served, carelessly; and Number One handed him the two hundred dollars. i  Another laugh went round. O, the heartlessness of human beings! What they would regard as a grave misfortune, if it happened to themselves, they look upon as an excellent joke when another is the victim. "Dat's nuffin," said the darkey, trying to appear unconcerned. But O, how poorly he succeeded! "Nothing, when you get used to it once," observed one of the spectators, soothingly. "But it takes a fellow a deuce of a time to get used to it," put in another unfeeling passenger. Poor darkey turned away, as sad a picture as I ever saw, went and took a seat on the capstan, and tried to whistle a careless tune. But his clumsy lips were dry and unsteady, and he couldn't get them puckered in any sort of shape. ["Confound if I haven't come near forgetting my valise, with this fooling," said Number Two, abruptly, after he had stowed away his money. "I left it up in Quincy, and must go and get it." So, he walked down the gangway plank, up the wharf, and dis- appeared in the city. "I wouldn't be surprised if that fellow were a regular rogue," observed Number One, gazing after him. "I intend to keep my eye on him." And he, too, went ashore. Soon after, the boat backed out from the landing, and proceeded up the river; but neither Number One *Ior Number Two were among the passengers.    <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6734-00000128"/> 250    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER XXXIV. A SAME OF FHECKEkS. JN traveling up the Mississippi river, I could not help remarking that the Illinois shore was, with but few exceptions, very low-in many places not more than a foot or two above ordinary water, and, in some places, even submerged; while the western shore-that of Missouri and Iowa-was, with some exceptions, reasonably high. Illinois is a low, swampy State, nearly all over. I have visited all portions of it, both the borders and the interior; and, excepting the vicinity' of Peoria, and some few bluffs along the Mississippi river, the ground is low, flat, marshy, and evidently anything but salubrious. The soil, however, is as rich as any in the world; and things grow there in a way that would be quite novel to an eastern man. By and by, it will be drained, grow more healthy, and, perhaps, become the richest and most desirable State of the Mississippi Valley. The most beautiful land I ever saw any where, was in Iowa, between Davenport, on the Mississippi shore, and Iowa City, in the interior. It is difficult to look:, upon that garden-like land, when clothed in its dress of summer, without actually breaking forth in   A GAME OF CHECKERS.      251 words of admiration. It is slightly rolling-just enough so to relieve it from excess of water-the view is little obstructed by timber; and one can stand on a somewhat elevated point, and see for eight or ten miles in any direction-see the smooth green fields spread out before him, like the face of the ocean, till they fade in dimness and kiss the blue sky at the dis- tant horizon! But, in winter, stay away from these regions, with all their beauty, unless you are fond of being frozen; for the winter winds there can split a tough white-oak into rails, in no time, and fire itself couldn't stand!t long out-of-doors, without being frozen into icicles. Even their thermometers cannot stand it out-of-doors. They are obliged to hang them by the stove or fire- place-where they make it a point to keep the tem- perature of the air as high as twenty-five or thirty de- grees below zero. But this is a digression I did not intend. At Keokuk, I stayed all night, and, next morning, took an early train for Fort Madison, a flourishing town situated at the head of the Rapids, twenty-five miles above Keokuk. Not every one is aware that the navigation of the Mississippi is obstructed for some miles above Keokuk, by extensive rapids, in the course of which the water falls considerably. Yet such is the case. To bbviate the difficulty, a railroad has been constructed from Keokuk to Fort Madison, where the traveler takes another boat up the river. When the water is high, however, boats of any size go over the rapids, as they do over the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville.    <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6734-00000129"/> 252    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. In the car, a gentleman, who was a native of Iowa, occupied the same seat with me. Noticing that * had a checker-board in my hand, which I had taken out of my trunk while on board the boat, the previous day, he said: "Do you play checkers?" "A little," I replied. "Do you?" "I don't often get beat," was his modest (?) rejoin- der. "Will you take the boat at Fort Madison?" Yes." "Then, if you desire, we will play a game or two, when we get aboard." "I was just about to make the same proposition," he returned. The train had not proceeded far, when, as we were passing a saw-mill, we saw a man, who had charge of a yoke of oxen, standing, with open mouth, gazing upon the train, and staring the very locomotive out of countenance. He was one of the homeliest men I ever saw. My companion and I had had some con- versation with two lively young ladies, who occupied the seat in front of us, and one of them remarked: "' What a singular-looking man!" The other laughed. "'He isn't a very pretty man, is he?" said I. "No," retorted my male companion, who probably thought this (because he knew me to be from Penn- sylvania,) a thrust at Iowa generally, " he looks like a Pennsylvanian." This, he certainly meant for a hit at the old Keystone State. I said nothing, however, but silently determined to   A GAME OF CHECKERS.      253 have revenge at checkers, when we should get on the boat---unless my companion should prove to be a re- markable player. So, when we had' embarked at Fort Madison, and were gliding up the river. I saw the Iowa gentleman sauntering through the cabin, and said: "Are you ready for that game of checkers?" "O, yes," he replied; "I was looking for you." We sat down by one of the tables, arranged the board and " men," and went at it. He moved with much circumspection, and was very careful lest he should make a blunder. But, with all his caution, he soon made one, which I quickly saw; and I gave him one of my men, took three of his in exchange, and hopped into the king-row. "Pshaw!" he exclaimed, in a tone of vexation. "I wasn't watching!" I soon won that game, and he didn't get a king. "Let's try it again," said he. "I will do better next time." "I hope so," I replied, as we replaced the men- but I didn't hope so. This time he moved with more care than ever, and succeeded-in getting beaten as badly as before. 'lie tried it again and again, till we had played eight games, and I had won two-thirds of a dozen of them. "I will not play any more," he said, petulantly, as he arose from the table. "I never met with such a player." "I play the Pennsylvania game," I complacently observed.    <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6734-00000130"/> 254    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. I landed at Muscatine, Iowa, that evening, where I remained all night. Muscatine is about thirty miles below Davenport, and is called a city. Its population is eight or ten thousand. Next morning, I took an early train for Wilton, a flourishing town situated at the intersection of two railroads, in the interior of the State. I visited some relatives there, and passed a week or two with them very pleasantly.   JOHN IN CHCAGO.      255 CHAPTER XXXV. OHN IN FHCAGO. ARLY in July, having visited various sections of Iowa, I started one evening for Chicago, where I arrived next morning about daylight- the distance from Wilton being a little over two hun- dred miles. Chicago is styled the "Garden City," because handsome private gardens are attached to many of the residences. There are other cities, however, which, for the same reason, are equally entitled to the sobriquet. Chicago is much the largest city of the northwest. It has sprung up faster than any other, and has now a population of about two hundred and ten thousand. It is situated in North-eastern Illinois, on the shore of Lake Michigan. It is one of the liveliest cities in the country, and must always be the largest city of the Mississippi Valley, except Saint Louis, which will naturally stand number one, on account of the nu- merous advantages of its position. An appropriate sobriquet for Chicago, I think, would be "City of Boards"-because it is built chiefly of boards. Most of the houses are frame buildings, weather-boarded; the sidewalks are nearly    <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6734-00000131"/> 256    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. all composed of thick pine boards; and the streets are paved with the "Nieholson pavement." The sidewalks are raised some feet above what was once the original height of the ground, leaving many dirty caverns beneath--an arrangement highly gratifying to the rats. The rat population of Chicago is sup- posed to amount to about one hundred to each in- habitant of the genus homo, which would make their whole number about twenty-one millions. As Josh Billings remarks, "This shows at a glance how many waste rats there is." They are very playful, espec- ially about eleven o'clock, when one is going home from the theater. One night, returning from Crosby's Opera House, I counted all I saw on my way to my lodging-house. I had but three or four squares to go, however, and therefore only counted eighteen. Of these, I succeeded in knocking only two over with my cane, by way of amusement. As I had done in Cincinnati and Saint Louis, I hired a lodging-room, and took my meals at a restau- rant. The room was a very good one, in a house on Dearborn street, opposite the Post office. I spent some weeks quite pleasantly in the "Gar- den City," during which, the only very funny thing that happened to me, was my nearly getting drowned in Lake Michigan. My love of rowing led to this. On a beautiful moonlight evening, two young ladies, and a young gentleman who lived in the same house, went down with me to the lake, and we hired a row- boat. We seated ourselves comfortably in the boat-I taking the oars---lided away from the shore, and   JOHN IN CHCAGO.      257 were soon outside of the breakwater, where the full moon, rising in the eastern sky, made an endless path of quivering and shining silver over the limpid waves. The air was still, balmy and pleasant on the water. But the wind had been blowing that day, the waters were agitated, and the waves rolled considerably. When we were two miles from shore, we lay-to for a time; and while the waves rocked us about, in a playful manner, the two young ladies and the gentle- man--I never sing--sung a beautiful song, which, the murmuring of the lake blending with it, and the beauty of the evening, rendered quite enchanting. When they ceased singing, one of the young ladies said: "I wonder if I could row? "I have no doubt of it," I respqnded; " did you ever try it?" "No, never." "Then," I rejoined, " it is possible you are an ex- cellent rower, and have never given yourself an opportunity to discover it. Will you try it?" "I'm afraid, ' she said, timidly. "Nothing to fear," I urged; "the oars are sta- tionary in the row-locks, and you cannot lose them. Moreover, there is no wind or tide, and the boat can- not run away with you;" Thus encouraged, she said "I believe I'll try it." "Then let us exchange seats," said I. "Well." She was sitting aft, and as we moved to exchange seats, we awkwardly attempted to pass each other on the same side of the boat thus throwing too much 17    <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6734-00000132"/> 258    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. weight on the port gunwale, and destroying the equi- librium of the boat and all the crew. Just then, too, a fine, fresh, unusually large wave came rolling along. The lady caught at the side of the boat as she lost her balance, but missed it, and pitched out! The boat dipped; the wave swept over, nearly filling it with the pure waters of the lake; and a wild scream of terror from the other lady lent interest to the scene. I seized the unfortunate one in time, dragged her into the boat and called quickly to the gentleman to go to bailing, and never mind the price of hats. He wore a fine silk castor that held a gallon or so, and it was refreshing to see the way he began bailing with it. I hastily turned the head of the boat toward the waves, and we rose with the next one. Managing to keep her straight with one oar, I took my "beaver" in the other hand, and went to bailing for dear life. Meantime, the two ladies were trembling with terror, one of them coughing, sneezing and strangling, too- and uttering brief impromptu prayers, such as "Lord, save us!" and the like. I assured them there was not the slightest danger- that the water was not deep there anyhow, that I could reach the bottom with an ordinary poker-I meant by jumping out and diving with it, though- and I succeeded in restoring their nerves to something like composure. As we were all soaking wet, from top to toe-and especially the young lady who had taken an invol- untary dive into the deep-green waters-we began to steer for the "Garden City :" which we reached   JOHN IN CHCAGO.     259 with thankful hearts, wet clothes and hats utterly ruined. As the others stepped out of the boat before me, I observed that, with the exception of my person, it was entirely empty, and said: "Where in the deuce is my crutch?" "Isn't it in the boat?" responded the young gentle- man, who stood on the shore. I will never forget the picture he presented, as he stood there in the moonlight. His ruined hat was on his head, and it had lost all its stiffening, the nap was no longer sleek, smooth and shiny, but was rumpled and crooked, and stuck out in all directions; while the now pliable crown was crushed down till it rested on his cranium, like a wet dishcloth laid on the top of ,is head, and looked as though it had been beaten down by a terrific hail-storm. The dull, life- less, lead-like way in which his garments hung about him may -be imagined. "Your crutch?" said he. "Can it be possible that it fell out when the boat tipped?" 'Blazes 7"I exclaimed. "How will I get home?" I might have hopped all the way-four squares- but that novel mode of locomotion would have attracted public attention and placed me in an undig- nified light. "Here it is," said one of the girls, laughing. "I took it out when I left the boat." And, riuch to my relief and delight, she handed it to me. The other young lady also handed me my cane, which she had picked up on leaving the boat. You had better believe I was glad, if you are fond    <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6734-00000133"/> 260    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. of being correct in your opinion, for I was just making up my mind to row out upon the Lake again, and look for my crutch, as I thought it possible I might find it floating about somewhere. I would have had a wide bit of territory to canvass.   TRAVELING COMPANIONS.     261 CHAPTER    XXXVI. TRAVYELING  OMPANIONS. BOUT the middle of July, I resolved to return to Philadelphia before completing my tour; and one evening I took an express train for Pittsburg, via the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad. The train was not crowded, and each passenger in the car I was in had. a whole seat to himself. We had traveled about a hundred miles, and were rolling across the State of Indiana, in the darkness of night, when two persons got on at a station, some- where, came to the middle of the car, and one took a seat beside me, while the other sat immediately in front. I glanced casually at my companion, and had not the slightest difficulty in making out that he was a sharper. "This is a fine evening," he said to me, politely, as the train thundered onward. "Very," I replied. Let it be borne in mind, however, that he had no special reason for stating, nor I for agreeing, that it was a "fine evening." On the contrary, it was dark and cloudy, and looked like rain. "How far are you going?" he asked.    <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6734-00000134"/> 262    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "To Philadelphia," I frankly replied. "Ah? So am I." "Do you live there?"I queried. "No; but I have an uncle there-a merchant--? "What street?"I asked, pertly. "Why-I-O, yes! Market street."   He then changed the subject, and said: -"I see you have lost a leg." "Yes," I assented. "In the war, I suppose?" Yes." "Ah!" he pursued, with earnestness, " many noble youths have made this sacrifice for their country, and I hope they will never be forgotten." "I hope so, truly," I replied. "I know," he went on, " that you must find it very inconvenient traveling, in your condition-especially when it comes to changing cars, and the like-and I was going to suggest that I would remain with you till we reach Philadelphia, and render you any assistance--  "Thank you," I interrupted. "The truth is, I used to get around very clumsily, when I had two feet to take care of; but now, having got rid of one of the encumbrances, I get about astonishingly well. If you knew how convenient it is to have but one leg to take care of, you wouldn't retain both yours a week. You'd have one of them sawed off, sir. You would indeed." Mr. Sharper began to see that I wasn't his man, and he presently got up and took a seat just in front of his pal. On the same seat was a young man who   TRAVELING COMPANIONS.     263 evidently had not made a regular business of traveling, and with him Mr. Sharper struck up an animated con- versation, soon gaining his confidence. By and .by, he introduced a very curious puzzle, with two cups and ivory balls, which he said he had bought that day from an Italian peddler with one eye, who had lost a brother and two wives in a storm at sea, on his way to this country. I was not near enough to see the exact construction of the cups and balls; but it was not long before he got up a bet about them, with the green traveler. His confederate, sitting on the seat between him and me, still pretending to be a stranger to him, made a sham bet of thirty dollars, and the other man on the same seat-also a man who had never been sharpened on the grindstone of ex- perience-bet fifteen dollars. The money was put up in the hands of a passenger, and, of course, Sharper won. He and his confederate got off at the next station, each about twenty dollars "in;" leaving a couple of foolish passengers so niuch poorer, and, it is to be hoped, so much wiser. Reader, in your travels, beware of friendly strangers. John Smith always bewares of 'em, and it pays. A description of a forty hours'- ride by railroad, would prove as tiresome to the reader as the ride always does to me. It is a delightful thing, in fine weather, to take a ride of fifty or a hundred miles on a train; to see the fields, and houses, and gardens, and barns, and woods, and fences flying past you, and to feel that lightning would get tired before it could catch you: but when youf have to ride a thousand I    <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6734-00000135"/> 264    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. miles, as I have often done, the thing becomes fright- fully monotonous, and is any thing but a pastime. Especially when night comes does the ride grow tiresome. As for sleeping-cars, I have long since vetoed them, as far as I am concerned. I decide that they are a nuisance, and I believe the majority of travelers will ratify and endorse my decision-and thus render it legal. I never slept in one yet, that I did not suffer all the time, either from heat or cold. Such a thing as an even or moderate temperature, I never experienced in a sleeping-car. Then the space! To be stuffed, as tight as the wad in a pop-gun, into a narrow cell, which they honor with the appellation of " berth," a cell so narrow as to evoke unpleasant contemplations of the anticipated long and narrow home we must all go to; so narrow and contracted that you haven't room for your elbows; so narrow that you can't turn over without getting out upon the floor for the purpose; so narrow and close that, as you lie on your back, you are afraid to wink, lest you shouldc scrape your eyelids against the ceiling above you and break the lashes off: to be crammed into a place like this, I say, with an implied promise of repose, is the opposite extreme of extraordinary felicity  However, occupying a seat in a car, for a whole night, is no delicacy, either; although I prefer it to the berth." How frequently one consults his time- piece on such an occasion! I'look at my watch, and find it, say, twelve o'clock, P. M. Then I recline on my seat and try to steal a little sleep. At first, I feel quite comfortable, and fancy I can sleep in that posi- tion for several hours. But scarcely have I time to   TRAVELING COMPANIONS.      265 draw a breath, before I find that my head does not rest quite comfortably against the window-sill or the back of the seat; I move it slightly; then I find that my arm is going asleep; I move it; then my ankle is twisted; I move it; then I find that my whole body is out of shape; I move, turn round and lie with my head the other way; then I close my eyes, and doze; I wake, presently, with a start; find my nose itching, and my leg asleep and beginning to tingle as though ten million insects were swarming in it; I then rub my eyes, think an hour has passed, look at my watch, and find it thirteen minutes after eleven. Find I made a mistake of an hour when I looked the other time. At last, the night has dragged itself away; and, O, how welcome are the tips of morning's "rosy wings," as they flutter upon the horizon among the hills or over the plains! How welcome are the gray streaks that play in the east, ushering glorious morn- ing upon the skies! How welcome the green fields again, as the curtain of the gloomy night is lifted from the face of Nature! I 'involuntarily exclaim with Shakspeare: "Look what streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East I Night's candles are put out; and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain top."    <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6734-00000136"/> 266    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER    XXXVII. MLWAUKEE AND THE     FAKES. T REMAINED in Philadelphia a month, then re- turned to Chicago, in order to begin where I left off and finish my tour. I only remained in the "Garden City " long enough to give my old friends there a call, and to get a slight attack of cholera; then moved northward. I went by railroad to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city with a population of sixty thousand, situated on the shore of Lake Michigan, about ninety miles from Chicago. Milwaukee is remarkable for at least three things. First, it is built, almost exclusively, of a kind of yellow brick that presents a neat appearance I much admire. Second, the German element predominates in the population. In fact, I believe that fully three- fourths of the inhabitants are Germans. Third, the lager-beer there is of a superior quality. So superior is it, that it deserves more than a passing remark. It is everywhere conceded among intelligent persons, that Milwaukee produces the best lager-beer that is made in this country. It has such extraordinary (" body.' It has none of that resin-soap-and-old-boot taste, which we frequently have the misfortune to discover in beer; but is the pure, unadulterated, un-   MLWAUKEE AND THE LAKES.      267 sophisticated lager-beer, even such as nature intended it should be, when she produced the grain, hops and water to make it of. Beside, they give a fellow such a large glass there for five cents! The glass holds about a pint. I confess that I felt conscience-stricken whenever I took one, and only paid five cents for it. That was the price, however. I would have offered more, only I feared that I might be thought verdant; and John Smith does not desire to rest under such an imputation. Early in September, I embarked for Detroit, Michi- gan, on the St. Louis, a handsome lake propeller, running between Chicago and Buffalo. Our route was via ,Lake Michigan, Fort Mackinaw, (in the straits,) Lake Huron, the St. Clair river, Lake St. Clair and the Detroit river. If you will take the trouble to glance at a map of the United States, dear reader, you will perceive that Lakes Huron and Michigan are two parallel lakes running north and south, and that they curve round and intersect each other at the north, forming an inverted letter U. I look back upon my voyage on the Lakes, as the pleasantest of my life. Our vessel was a first-class steamer, the passengers were all jolly and good- natured, taken collectively; the ladies were amiable, affable and beautiful; and the gentleman were sober, intelligent, agreeable, and good judges of beer. I will never forget my first evening on board the St. L0ouis. We were steering N. N. E. the western shore had just faded from view, and the sun was sinking into his rosy couch. A few light clouds hung over the horizon, like crimson and purple cur-    <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6734-00000137"/> 268    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. tains, as the god of day sunk into his luxuriant bed of rest, reminding one of McDonald Clark's beautiful lines: "Now twilight lets her curtain down And pins it with a star." The lake was nearly smooth, and the red light, making its lengthy paths over the wide waters, from west to east, looked like myriads of playful little flames chasing each -other over the crests of the waves. The sun rose next morning and smiled on us over the north-western shore of the State of Michigan, and we found ourselves approaching Mackinaw Straits. That afternoon the vessel laid for a couple of hours atL an island in the Straits, and the passengers all went ashore. We discovered the earth to be about as nearly barren as any soil could be. Late as it was in the season, September, we found a few stunted rasp- berries, that were just making a feeble effort to ripen. While the propeller lay there, half-a-dozen of the male passengers, I among them, hired a sailboat, and, accompanied by three or four of the lady passengers, took a pleasant sail of an hour. I think I never saw such clear water anywhere as I saw there. A'pin could have been distinctly seen at the depth of twenty feet. I was so charmed with the limpid water, and the white sand and pebbles at the bottom, that I fancied it would have been almost a luxury to be drowned there. That night we stopped for an hour at Fort Macki- naw. Next morning--Sunday morning-we found our-   MLWAUKEE AND THE LAKES.    269 selves in Lake Huron. Another beautiful day passed away in perfect harmony and happiness on board the St. Louis, and another night came. All this time the propeller glided along so smoothly that one could scarcely believe, at times, that she moved at all, till he .should go out, look over the side, and see the green waters rushing by, and the waves receding from the prow on either side. I never slept anywhere more tranquilly than on board the St. Louis. Next morning, we found ourselves in the St. Clair river, which runs north and south, and connects Lake Huron with Lake St. Clair. On its eastern shore is Canada, and on its western the State of Michigan. About nine o'clock, we landed at the town of New- port, Michigan, the home of the captain. Being assured by him that she would lie there several hours, another passenger and myself went ashore and walked up into the town, with the view of hunting a billiard-table and playing a game or two. Some others also went ashore for a stroll. We found one, and played one game. I do not remember who won it. What happened shortly after was calculated to rub out trifles from one's memory. "Now," said I, when we had finished the game, we had better go. Something tells me we will not have time to play another." "O, pshaw!" replied my companion. "Didn't the captain tell us the boat would lie here several hours?" "True, but I cannot help feeling uneasy." O, nonsense! let's play another." We commenced another game, and had each made    <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6734-00000138"/> 270    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. fifteen or twenty points, when another fit of uneasi- ness seized me. "Come," said I, something tells me the boat is ready to leave; I'll give you this game. Let us go." "O, there's no danger of the boat's going," he re- plied. "It will whistle first, anyhow." We played about seven minutes longer, when a boy came in. Bub," said I, " is the St. Louis lying at the land- ing yet?" "Why," he replied, "did you 'uns, intend to go on her?" "Yes," said I. "Yonder she goes!" he said, coolly, as he pointed out the window looking down the river. Yes, the St. Louis had gone, and was just disap- pearing round a bend nearly half a milo distant. If the reader wants to know what pure, unalloyed anguish is, I can tell him that I experienced it on this occasion. There I was, fifty miles from my des- tination, and the propeller, on which I had spent several such happy days, gliding away and disappear- ing from my gaze, bearing from me the many good friends I had made armong the passengers, whom I should now never, probably, see again, depriving me of the melancholy pleasure of bidding them good-by, and also of taking the address of a handsome young lady I fell in love with-to say nothing of my trunk, and some other articles I prized highly, scattered about in my state-room. "I told you so," said I to my conscience-stricken companion.   MLWAUKEE AND THE LAKES.     271 He gazed from the window, threw down his cue, and pronounced a great many words, in rapid succes- sion, which, if found in the Scriptures, are not found exactly in the same order in which he uttered them. His case was worse than mine. His destination was Buffalo; and should we fail to reach Detroit ere the propeller should leave there-and we had little hope in that direction-he would lose four hundred miles of his ride. Besides, he had left his overcoat and revolver in his state-room, and who should answer for their safety?? As for me, my trunk was checked to Detroit, and I felt sure that it would be put off there; but in my state-room were left my chess-board, a set of chess- men, and other property, amounting in all to the value of about fifteen dollars--and what hope had I of ever seeing them again? Kein I "Well," said I, " let us make the best of it." "Yes, we might as well finish the game now," said he, ruefully. "First," I proposed, "let us drown our sorrows 'in a glass of beer." "Agreed," said he. And we did. "There'll be another boat along soon," observed the boy. "How soon?" we both asked, eagerly. "It ought to be here by eleven o'clock; that's its time.7  "Does it run to Detroit?"  "Yes; it's a little side-wheeler." "Then we'll watch for it."    <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6734-00000139"/>  272    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "If you will give me a glass of beer," said the boy, "I'll watch for it, and tell you when it comes." "Very well, watch for it. Whenever you see it coming, run and tell us, and we'll give you the beer." In less than half an hour, sure enough, we received the welcome intelligence that the boat was coming; and, giving the boy his beer, we hurried down to the landing, and reached it as the little steamer came up. We went aboard, and paid our fare to Detroit--an- other net loss of two dollars-and she soon moved on after the St. Louis. But we soon saw, with sinking hearts, that her speed was not eqcal to that of the propeller. When we reached Lake St. Clair--a lake as round as a dollar, (or the city of Boston,) and twenty-five miles in diameter-we fancied we could see the St. Louis just sinking beneath the southern horizon. If we did, we never saw her again-at least I never did. When we reached Detroit, she had been gone half an hour. My trunk was there, but my other articles were clearly forfeited. My companion and I got on the ferry-boat, went over to Windsor, Canada, just opposite Detroit, and inquired when the first train would depart for Buf- falo. We were informed that an express-train would go at seven. He determined to go, and did so, no doubt, arriving at Buffalo a dozen hours in advance of the propeller. I have never heard of him since. I told him, when we parted, to go to my state-room when he should reach the propeller, and take posses- sion of my chess-board, et cetera, remarking that I "' willed" them to him; and I presume that he did so.   MLWAUKEE AND THE LAKES.     273 The city of Detroit, where I remained a week, is about the size of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is the largest city in Michigan. It was there that Hull sur- rendered to the British, during the war of 1812; and it was there that the Fenians crossed into Canada and frightened the Canadians in 1866. So much for its historical importance. Its sobriquet is, "The City of the Straits." Its location on the Detroit river-- which is, more properly, a strait, connecting Lake St. Clair with Lake Erie--gives it this name. Detroit is a French word for strait. 18 try     <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6734-00000140"/> 274    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. C HAPTER   X X X V I I I SMITH IN SEARCH OF HS UNCLE. ROT M Detroit, I went, by railroad, to Toledo, Ohio, distant eighty or ninety miles. I stopped there with the view of visiting an uncle of mine, whom. I had never seen, and who resided near a little village called Holland, nine miles from the city. I inquired a whole dclay for a village of that name, but no one knew where it was. I began to think of offer- ing a reward for'it; but at last went to the post-office, where I gained the desired information. I was told that Holland was a little place on the Air Line Rail- road, and that it was also--and, in fact, regularly- called Springfield. I was furthermore told that the first train would go at ten o'clock that night.' As I did not contemplate remaining long at my uncle's, I left my trunk at an hotel in Toledo, and went out to Holland, alias Springfield, on that ten- o'clock train. It happened to be a naturally slow train, and, besides, it met with a little accident on tlhe way; so that it was eleven o'clock when we reached Holland, which I found to be a little village, compris- ing a couple of dwellingc-houses and a small grocery- store. When I got off the train, it moved on, and I found   SMITH IN SEARCH OF HS UNCLE.   275 myself standing beside the track, alone-a " stranger in a strange land," at night-time. What was I to do? The village appeared to be wrapped in sleep, and not a light was to be seen. Presently, however, I looked toward Toledo, and saw a man-obviously an em- ployd of the road-approaching me, carrying a red lantern in his hand. "Good evening," said I. "How do you do?" he returned, sleepily. "Did you just come up?" "Yes-just got off the train." "How did you-0, I thought it was Simon McCann," he said, as he drew nearer. "[No, I am not- Simon," I replied. "On the con- trary, my name is Smith-first name John. Do you know any one of that name here?" What a question to ask anywhere in the world! "O, yes; half-a-dozen families. There's old John, and - " "Do you know William Smith?" "Yes--quite an old man, is he not?" "Probably he is. I never saw him. He moved here twenty-five years ago." "From Pennsylvania?" "Yes." "Are you from Pennsylvania?" "Yes; can you --" "I see you've lost a"--I began to tremble now- "leg." "Yes, can--" "In the army?" I shuddered at the thought of having to stand    <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6734-00000141"/> 276    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. there and answer four or five hundred questions, at that time of night; and I determined, as I perceived he was getting illto a regular train of army questions, to make a desperate attempt at insulation. "Yes, can--" "What battle?" "Antietam where does--" "What reg--  I had already begun to ignore commas, and I now saw the necessity of throwing out the spaces between my words; and I hurriedly replied: "Eighthpennsylvaniareserveswheredidyousaywil liamsrithves?" The spell was broken, and he responded, like a white man: "About two miles from here." "Is there no hotel here?" "None." "No house of entertainment?" "No." "Is there any chance then to get a conveyance?" "None that I know of." "Then I must walk it. Will you direct me to -his house?" "Yes; you go--- He gave me the directions, and they appeared so plain that I fancied I could find my uncle's house with my eyes shut.' The moon was just up, the night was beautiful and pleasant, and the roads surpassingly muddy; and I had a walk that night that, I think, will never "slip my memory." The land in this portion of Ohio is   SMITH IN SEARCH OF HS UNCLE.   2" low and flat, the soil black, loose and soft--very fer- tile, too, so far as that is concerned; but a man isn't particular about rich ground to walk on with a crutch-and the soundings were from three to thirty inches. At the first cross-road, I went astray-took the wrong road, traveled half-a-mile on it, and, beginning to grow apprehensive, stopped by a gate, yelled, waked somebody's neighbor, and asked if that was the road to William Smith's? "Did you come from the station?" was. the re- sponse of the neighbor, who was in his night-dress. Yes." "Then you are on the wrong road. You should have kept on toward the south at the cross-roads. It is at the next cross-road after that. Then you turn to the  "I thought he said-- right." "Thank you," I said. "Good-night." "Good-night." The door closed, and I was alone. I retraced my muddy way, followed closely by a large savage dog belonging to the owner of the house, while-the soil being unusually pliable there-my -crutch sunk in eighteen inches at every step. Before reaching my uncle's that night, I got off the wrong road, and on it again, five times, did two miles of superfluous walking and two miles of the requisite article, waked whole dozens of neighbors, and alarmed whole battalions of dogs. These faithful creatures barked furiously as I approached, and set others to barking, in response, at a distance, and they barked and set others to barking at another distance,    <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6734-00000142"/> 278    JOIIN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. and they others, and so on, and so on, again; till I must have indirectly and innocently aroused or dis- turbed the greater portion of the population of Ohio that night. Cleveland, Sandusky, Steubenville, Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati, all heard from me through the dogs. At last, worn and weary and covered with mud, I found the place, and not without apprehensions of getting shot for a robber, approached the door, and knocked. As intimated, I had never seen my uncle, and how did I know what kind of man he was, or what sort of reception awaited me? Suppose he should be ill- natured, being disturbed at that time of night, and make me feel as though I were not welcome? Such misgivings suggested themselves to me, as I stood at the door. I knocked a couple of times, without getting anv reply, and began to fear that my uncle supposed me to be a burglar and was getting his gun ready to shoot through the door. I therefore stepped aside, and yelled: "Hallo!" I heard a movement within, but no reply. "Hallo!"I repeated: the somber echoes of my voice rang through a gloomy wood near by; and I was a little Bfraid it might stir up a panther or wild- cat, and tempt it to come out and eat a piece of me. "Who is there?" came from within. "Does William Smith live here?" was my non- committal rejoinder. "Yes."   SMITH IN SEARCH OF HS UNCLE.   279 A I am his nephew from Pennsylvania, John Smith, Junior," said I, in a distinct voice. The whole house Shook, as my uncle sprung from the bed and alighted on the floor of the little old- fashioned farm-house. "Wait one moment," said he, in a voice that was musical with welcome. There was a hasty fumbling among garments for a moment, and a glad little light sprung up within, and peeped slyly out at me from crevices about the door. Then the door opened, and before me stood a strong old man of seventy-three, with snow-white hair and beard. 'Is this my uncle?"I asked. "Yes," he; replied, cordially grasping my hand. "Come in, my boy 1 You are my nephew John?" "Yes." "And have lost your leg. Too bad!" "' O, I don't mind that any more, uncle," I said, as I walked in. Never have I been received anywhere with such open-hearted welcome, as by this aged uncle. It was nearly two o'clock ; my aunt-only two years younger than he-soon made her appearance, and welcomed me as cordially as he had done: ten thousand ques- tions were asked and answered, and the early morning would have found us still in conversation, but that my uncle, by and by, observed. that I must be tired, after my walk, and said I had better take some rest. That I had walked from the station with my crutch and cane, lost my way several times, and wandered about over some portion of the State of Ohio, was a matter-of marvel to him. ,    <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6734-00000143"/> 280    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. Not to tire the reader with family affairs-however interesting a general history of the Smith Family might be--I will silently pass over the brief and happy period I spent with my good uncle and aunt. I took a propeller at Toledo, for Buffalo, and after a pleasant voyage of two nights and a day, on Lake Erie, arrived at that city. I spent a few days there among my' Cold Spring friends-in the course of which I had but one narrow escape from drowning, while out on the lake on a pleasure-excursion--then returned to Philadelphia, via the New York and Erie, Northern Central, and Pennsylvania Central Railroads.   SMITH'S KNOWLEDGE OF GERMAN, ETC.  281 CHAPTER    XXXIX. XMTH'S KNOWLEDGE OF GERMAN, ET CETERA. IN the fall, I determined on another western tour, which I accomplished. In this tour I visited the following places: Columbus, Dayton, and Cincin- nati, Ohio; Indianapolis and Lafayette, Indiana; Springfield, Decatur, Bloomington, El Paso, and Peoria, Illinois. I had intended to go on into Iowa again, but winter came on, and it began to get too cold for me. So, I returned to Philadelphia shortly before Christmas, via Logansport, Fort Wayne, and Pittsburg. During this tour, not much happened that would interest or divert the reader. I might briefly mention one or two amusing incidents that came under my notice. Often as I had passed through Lancaster, Pennsyl- vania, I had never stopped there; and, on my way west, I determined to drop off for twenty-four hours. In Lancaster every one talks English and German, (or Dutch, as they call it there,) with equal fluency; and it is not unusual for a person relating an incident or making some remarks, to begin in English and end in Dutch; or vice versa. While I was sitting in my hotel, not far from the    <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6734-00000144"/> 282    JOHN SAMTH ON A CRUTCH. depot, a Lancastrian, who lounged in, got to telling the proprietor a very interesting story, of an adven- ture he had recently met with while hunting ducks. He, was relating the story in English,/ and I listened with interest. The purport of the story was that he and another man had shot at a duck simultaneously; it had fallen, and a dispute had arisen as to which had brought it down. Just as he reached the crisis of the story, where the dispute was about to be de- cided, against the other fellow, of course-and there seemed some funny circumstance about it, for they laughed immoderately--he jumped off the track, as it were, and finished in Dutch, something like this: "Undsehrichtienochtuchuherkroshomlustienblosterb hionmemmtehtehtchtchch-h-h-h-h-h-h   h  --h h--    -h-   - -h-cht-AUGH!" Imagine how -tantalizing this was to me. My knowledge of German or Dutch is very limited. Be. yond Lager Bier und Schweitzer Kase, ein, swei drei I simply know nothing of any of those Teutonic lan- guages; anal I, therefore, do not, to this day, know the denoueement of the Lancastrian's story. While in Lancaster, I took the liberty of calling on two prominent men of opposite political parties, both of whom have since passed away. I allude to Jamnes Buchanan and Thaddeus Stevens. Each re- ceived me cordially and conversed with me in an easy and pleasant manner. From the citizens of Lancaster, I learned that they were kind-hearted, and noble men, and that their private characters were above reproach. Those two public men were regarded with some bitter- ness during their lives; but whatever may have been   SMAITH'S KNOWLEDGE OF GERMAN, ETC.  283 their errors, I believe they were errors of the head and not of the heart. They are at rest now, and I earnestly ask the whole people of our Country to join me in saying-"PEACE TO TIlE ASHES OF BOTH!" I shall never forget the extraordinary courage I saw displayed by an hotel clerk, in Columbus, Ohio, while sojourning'there during the little tour in ques- tion. I was in the sitting-room, one day, when a large, rough-looking man, in a state of inebriation, came in, took a seat in one of the arm-chairs, and manifested symptoms of slumber. The clerk soon saw him, went promptly to him, and gave him to understand that that state of things wouldn't do. "Come," said the clerk, "this won't do. You must get out of this. We don't Dvnt a man to come in here drunk, and sit around half asleep." "Wha-at?" growled the inebriate. "I say you must get out of this," said the clerk, laying his hand on his shoulder. "Come!" He said this in a decided tone, as though he ex- pected the drunken gentleman to get up and be led out. But the man made no move toward getting up, and, moreover, didn't appear to be much afraid of the clerk.          I "Did you, hear what I said '?" demanded the latter, shaking him slightly. "Well, s'pose I did? What then?" Such impudence to an hotel clerk! "What then! I'll show you what then! Now, you get out o' here!"And he seized the inebriate's shoulder. Thereupon the latter arose slowly, and I supposed    <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6734-00000145"/> 284    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. he was going out; but when he got straightened up, he turned defiantly on the clerk, and raised his fist as though about to strike "from the shoulder." "Clear out, you darn cuss!" he said, to the frightened clerk, who retreated with agility. "Don' come layin' yer hands onto me, or I'll batter the nose off o' yer face!'" "Well, you've got to get out of here," said the clerk. "You can't put me out," retorted the intoxicated gentleman, defiantly. "You'll see pretty soon," said the clerk, who, how- ever, kept at a safe distance. "I'm not going to allow a fellow that's been somewhere and got full of rum to come in here andesleep it off! You got nothing to drink in this house."                X X "I would if I'd 'a' wanted it." "You would, eh?"The clerk now walked toward the door, and, in doing so, was obliged to pass within a few feet of the intruder; and the latter, not know- ing what his intentions were, turned round slowly, as if on a pivot, so as to keep his face toward the clerk till he went out. In about three-quarters of a minute the latter returned, and exclaimed: "What! Haven't you gone yet?" "No-nor aint a goin' till I'm ready. An', look out!" he exclaimed, as the clerk approached him again. "Don't ye come near me, or I'll spilter ye 1" I do not know exactly what he meant by this re- markable word, as I have searched in vain for it in the lexicons of several languages: but I suppose he meant something dreadful.   SMITH'S KNOWLEDGE OF GERMAN, ETC.   285 The clerk, however, did not seem inclined, as yet, to make any aggressive movement: he merely walked past him, as before; and again the pugnacious gentle- man stood on the defensive, and personated a first- class pivot. Strange as it may seem, I could not help fancying that if I had been in authority at the hotel, as the clerk was, I would not have trifled quite so long with an insolent drunken man. While these sage thoughts were revolving in my mind, the clerk seemed to grow all at once, inspired with extraordinary courage. Starting suddenly from where he stood, he walked briskly toward the intruder, saying, decidedly: "'Now walk out of here in less than a second!" And he actually laid hands on the big fellow. The secret of the matter was that two policemen entered at that moment, having been sent for by the clerk at the time- of his brief absence from the room; and that was what raised his courage so wonderfully. The two officers walked the pugnacious inebriate out, and the clerk followed him to the door, saying: "Confound you! You won't eome in here loafing around! 1Next time you try such a game, I'll kick you out!" "Go to-  "The sound of the loafer's voice died away,.as he was trotted out by the preservers of the peace, and I am unable to record what the rest of the sentence was. While at Decatur, Illinois, I heard a conversation between a traveler and an hotel clerk, that strikingly exemplifies the irregularity of western railroad trains. "What time does the train go to Springfield?" he    <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6734-00000146"/> 286    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. inquired, at the counter, about eight o'clock in the evening. "-At twelve," replied the clerk. "Then," rejoined the traveler, who was evidently posted, " give me a room, and wake me at about one. That will be time enough." He was right. The "twelve o'clock train" from Lafayette, going through to Springfield, did not come along till about fifteen minutes after one. In the winter time, a traveler in the west can always count on a train about one hour after its time, unless some unusual accident has delayed it. At Logansport, Indiana, I got taken down a little. The way of it,was this: On the train from Peoria, I made the acquaintance of a gentleman who kept an hotel in Logansport, and, in the course of the morning, as we neared that place, I borrowed a literary paper from him, which I forgot to return. Having an hour or two to wait for a train to Fort Wayne, where I should be obliged to change cars again for Pittsburg, I went into the hotel of the gentleman mentioned, for the purpose of getting breakfast. Having taken break- fast, I thought of the paper I had borrowed, and not seeing the landlord, and desiring to return it to the owner in person, and thank him for the favor, I asked the clerk where he was.  "He is out at the stables," returned the clerk. "Will he be in soon?" "'I don't know. He went out to show a man a horse that he has for sale." "Then I will go out; shall I go through this way?"   SM}ITHS KNOWLEDGE OF GERMAN, ETC. 287 I asked, pointing to a path leading from the rear of the house to the stables. "Yes, go right out that way. But be careful. There is a dog out in the yard that is a little cross sometimes, and-- " "O," I interrupted, carelessly, " no dog bites me. I am not afraid." The fact is, I have ever prided myself on the "charm"I can exercise over the canine race, and have often taken the most ill-natured dogs in my hands, picked them up bodily,- and even put my hands invitingly to their mduths, and they have not harmed me. The reason is simply that I never shrink from them, or exhibit any fear; which demeanor in- spires the sagacious creatures with respect for a fellow. It was a large, and beautifully-spotted black-and- white dog, and, as I pursued my way to the stables, it came trotting out from a kennel it occupied, and looked at me as much as to say: "Are you afraid of me, sir?" I looked calmly down upon the animal, as if to reply: "Sagacious creature, I am not." To prove that I wasn't, I paused to admire it, and fearlessly laid my hand upon its head. Thereupon, it capered around me, joyfully, and made a succession of springs upon me as though to kiss me. Just then three juvenile canines, that I had not observed before, came running from the kennel; and their resemblance to the adult one was so ftriking, that I had no diffi- culty in making out the fact that a near relationship existed between and among them. I stooped down    <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6734-00000147"/> 288    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUWH. to pet one of the little beauties on the head, and just then, the big one made another playful spring at my face, not with any intention of biting me,--I'll be sworn to that,-when one of its confounded, awkward teeth struck me just below the eye and penetrated to the cheek-bone; and the crimson "gore" flowed from the incision. It was a most provoking circumstance, for the clerk was looking from the window, and the landlord and another man just then appeared at the stable-door, all thinking that the dog had bitten me; which placed me in a ridiculous light, in the eyes of the clerk, after my boast that dogs were not in the habit of biting me. Although the dog did not purposely hurt me, and was still capering about, playfully, I exe- crated its awkwardness, and felt that I could have knocked the top of its head off with my crutch-had no one been looking. It was a female dog, too, and I told it so, very concisely, in my vexation: which was all the satisfaction I had. Traveling incessantly for forty-eight hours, I reached Philadelphia on a winter night, when the wind was howling and the snow falling fast. I had slept very little on the trains during the last two nights, and it might well be surmised that an indivi- dual like John Smith (or " any other man ") would feel like " turning in," under the circumstances. Such a conclusion would be but rational. But it is said that, ("Man is a creature of circum- tances ;" and that adage was fully exemplified by my remarkable experience on that memorable night.   SMITH'S KNOWLEDGE OF GERMAN, ETC.  289 I had already instructed the baggage-agent on the Pennsylvania Central train to send my trunk to my residence, and I was just stepping forth from the depot, at Thirty-first and Market streets, with the view of walking home through the jovial snow-storm, when a familiar voice accosted me with: '"Hallo, Smith! Where have you been this long time? Where are you going?" I recognized a young friend named Feeny, who was standing near a sleigh, to which two handsome and spirited horses were attached. In the sleigh sat another friend named Aaron, who also said: "Why, Smith! How do you do?    Glad to see you. Where have you been b" "In the West," I replied. "Going home?" "Y es." t"Not going to walk?" "O don't do that! Get into the sleigh with Feeny and me, and ride." "By all means," urged Feeny. "Ar  e you going directly home?"They lived near my residence. "N-no-but that need make no difference. We were just taking a little sleigh-ride. You  don't mind a  ride of an hour before you go home?" "I am rather weary," I replied. "'I have been rattling along in the cars for two days and two nights. Have come all the way from Peoria, Illinois." "Well, jump in. We will at least take a little 19    <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6734-00000148"/> 290     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. drive down Darby Road. You must feel chilly. Here is something to warm you.' This was an article of glassware, containing a genial fluid, designed for the. interior of mankind. Having availed myself of this blessing, I sprung into the sleigh; Feeny jumped in after me; and we dashed away in the blinding storm, "We were just at the depot to meet a friend we expected," said he, " but he did not come." Away we went out Market street, defying even the wintry wind to outstrip us. Instead of turning down the Darby Road, as proposed, we kept on out Market street. "We'll take a little ride out this way first," said Mr. Aaron, "then we will return, go down Darby Road, cross Gray's Ferry Bridge, and go home." "All right!"I We had an extensive ride through West Philadel- phia; and candor compels me to say that some of the proprietors of hotels in that vicinity lost nothing by it. At last, we found ourselves dashing down Darby Road: the noble steeds still fresh and vigorous, and we three "jolly boys"7 suffering nothing at all from the malady known as "depression of spirits." Rest! I thought not of it now. I remembered not that I had slept none for two nights. Away we went in the snow-storm; the wide fields of snow my inraginary bed, the murky clouds my curtains, the wind and sleigh-bells singing a merry song in concert to lull me to -walefulness and mirth.

That hour it   SMITH'S KNOWLEDGE OF GERMAN, ETC.  291 was, I can never know; but any one supposing it to be earlier than the beginning of another day, would subject himself to great ridicule among the " posted." "Wonder if the toll man's up?" said Feeny. "Doubtful," responded Aaron. "We'll wake him, of course," said I. "Certainly-if we can yell loud enough." We dashed onward. So far from tiring, our horses seemed to gain new strength and energy just then. The toll-gate and the little house there situated, were very near. We did not slacken our speed. "Toll!" yelled Feeny, in a loud voice. "Toll I! Toll!" shouted Aaron, as we reached the gate without stopping. "Toll! Tolll Toll!"I shrieked, in a jolly mood as we dashed by.        ' Alas I the keeper of the gate never had the felicity to receive that "toll." He did not get his uce; but we got plenty of snow. thGet up! Get up!" screamed Aaron, addressing the horses.

"LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE, AND A HOME ON THE ROLLING DEEP." OR some time I had projected, for the spring of 1867, a voyage to San Francisco, via Cape Horn. My friends advised me, if I wanted to go to California, to take a steamer and go by way of the Isthmus; but, for the novelty of the thing, I deter- mined to take passage on a sailing-ship and double Cape Horn, South America, where the Patagonians live, who. eat up all the unfortunate sailors driven on their shores. [It's a pity Cape Horn should ever be doubled, for there is too much of it now.] When March came, and it began to get windy and stormy, I went to New York, with the intention of taking passage on the first sailing-vessel that should clear for San Francisco. My friends again gave me a little wholesome ad- vice, and endeavored to dissuade me from attempting the voyage till after the stormy season, but I replied that I didn't mind seeing a storm at sea, that, in fact, I rather desired it: so, I went. Some of the merchants, ship-owners and underwri- ters of New York, have occasion to remember the clipper-ship BREWSTER, which sailed from New York for San Francisco, on the fourteenth of March, 1867,    <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6734-00000151"/> 294:    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. with a fresh north-west wind and under good auspices, generally. I, John Smith, was that ship's only pas- senger. She was not a passenger ship; but I was allowed to take passage on her, because I wanted to go round Cape Horn. Captain Collins, the master of the vessel, asked me whether I thought I could stand up on my crutch, when the ship should come to be tossed about on a rough sea: I replied that I didn't know about that, but that I was quite skillful at falling down. As before hinted, we sailed on the fourteenth of March; and as a powerful little tug towed us out of the harbor, past Forts Richmond, Lafayette and Hamilton, and I looked back and saw Trinity Church steeple fading from view, I pondered on the long voyage of four or five months before me, and won- dered when, if ever, I should see New York and the Atlantic coast again. That day, and the day following, the weather was so extremely cold, that the salt water of old Ocean, as it splashed over the bulwarks, froze into a nasty uncom- fortable slush, upon the deck. On the third morning -that of Saturday, the sixteenth of March--the air was much milder, and I began to entertain the liveli- est hopes that we were to be favored with pleasant weather, that I might sit by the low bulwarks of the forecastle deck, and watch the blue waves foaming and splashing as the ship plowed its way through them. Captain Collins was an excellent fellow, a lively and agreeable companion, and a perfect gentleman. The two mates, Messrs. Trufant and Gorham, were   A HOME ON -THE ROLLING DEEP.    295 unexceptionable; I was soon on the best terms with them, and anticipated a pleasant voyage. But, somehow or other, these three gentlemen were a little morose on this pleasant Saturday morning. It was quite unaccountable to me. ' What can be the reason?"  I asked myself. a' Can it be that they don't like pleasant weather, and would prefer it cold and stormy?"I had heard such things, of sea-faring men. [Reader, when you hear it said that sailors enjoy stormy weather, don't believe it.] About ten o'clock the first mate, Mr. Trufant, after several earnest consultations with the Captain, came out of the cabin,--while I was standing on deck enjoying the pleasant breeze and the fine view I had of the waste of waters-and called out: ' "Steward!" "Ay, ay, sir," respdnded the steward, from the galley. "Get up a few barrels of potatoes, and what other things you may need from the after-hatch: we're going to have a gale o' wind." [That was what the matter was. The barometer was getting low.] "Ay, ay, sir," said the steward. J The wind was still N. W., and glancing in that direction, I perceived that some solid-looking, lead- colored clouds were rising above the horizon. "Going to blow, is it?"I said, to the mate, as he walked by me. a' Yes, a little," he replied, as he proceeded to give some order to the sailors.    <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6734-00000152"/> 296    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. A couple of hours passed by, and I saw no indica- tions of a storm. It had grown a trifle cloudy; and the wind had increased but little. "We won't have that gale, after all, will we?"I remarked, as we sat at dinner. The captain laughed. "Give it time," said he. 'The barometer usually warns in advance. If you don't see a fresh breeze before morning, there will be a big change in the weather somewhere." I said no more. After dinner I was on deck, and, observing that the sailors were working the pumps, I said to Mr. Gorham, the second mate: "The ship leaks a little, does it?" "O, yes,'" he replied, indifferently: " all ships leak more or less." "' I hope ours will leak less, then, if we get in a gale," I said. "So do I," he returned; "but I fear it will leak more.' The ship was rocking somewhat, but I had not yet grown sea-sick. In fact, persons who have once been sea-sick are not quite so easily or so severely affected the second time. I walked to the bulwark, scanned the north-western horizon, and perceived that it was beginning to wear a threatening aspect. The wind was stronger, the waves rolling higher, and the sailors grave and thoughtful. It was no easy matter for me to stand, without holding to something: and hatch-houses, masts, bul-   A HOME ON THE ROLLING DEEP.   297 warks, ropes and belaying-pins came quite handy to brace myself against, or cling to with one hand. In another hour, the wind was blowing hard, the waves were running high, and one of them jumped over the bulwarks, and wet everybody on deck-- myself included. That is what sailors term, "Ship- ping a sea." "You had better stand within the cabin," observed the second mate. I thought so, too, made my way to the door, and stepped in. The cabin was built on deck; but a high sill at the bottom of the door-way kept the water from running in. I then stood at the cabin-door for a couple of hours, grasping each side of the door-way to brace myself, and watched the rising gale. - ,                 *    <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6734-00000153"/> 298    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER    XLI. J. SMITH'S CUIOSITY TO    SEE A GALE MOFPE THAN SATISFIED. ANOTHER heavy wave dashed over the bul- warks, and fell upon the deck, with a thump that made the ship tremble. The wind rose higher, and was soon howling among the rigging with a fierceness entirely new to me. Wave after wave swept over, and the deck was continually washed with the agitated waters. Evening came and I had no appetite for supper. Night came, darkness frowned on the furious sea, the wind increased in violence, and fairly screamed among the ropes, shrouds, masts, and yards; we were indeed in a gale. The ship tumbled about so, that I got sick; but determined not to give way to it. I stood by the cabin door, leaned over the high sill, and contributed my dinner to the waters of the ocean. The sails had all been taken in but the three lower top-sails, and with those still unfurled, we had been running before the wind. These were now taken in -except the lower main top-sail, which is always left unfurled, in order to control the ship-and the vessel was hove to: that is, turned with her head to the '*-   CURIOSITY MTORE THAN SATISFIED.   299 wind, her bow a point or two off, in order that she might rise on the waves. When these measures had been taken, it seemed to me that the wind just tried how hard it could blow; and to do it justice, I must say, that it blew much harder than I had ever before thought it could. Wave after wave-every successive one seeming to run higher and higher--struck the ship, which was contin- ually trembling, and straining, and "working," as though it might at any moment break to splinters. Ah, I began to realize that a storm at sea is no luxury! Reader, if you have not seen one, you are fortunate. If you ever start on a voyage, pray earnestly for smooth weather, and if your prayers are answered be very thankful. I retired to my room at last, and "turned in." That is the'nautical phrase for " going to bed." You never hear a sailor say he will " go to bed." He never "goes to bed." Such an expression would sound very odd at sea. "Turn in," is the proper term there. If a sailor should hear a man talk about "going to bed," he would think that man had actual- ly never been out of sight of land in his life. I " turned in," and slept. When I awoke again, the ship was tumbling about so that I wondered I had not been pitched out of my berth. Seeing one of the mates pass through the cabin, I accosted hiim with- "How is it, without?" "Blowing a regular gale," he replied. "What time is it?" "Seven bells."     <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6734-00000154"/> 300    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. ,At sea, they never say eight, nine, ten, eleven, or half-past eleven o'clock. There is a large bell at the forecastle, which is tapped every half-hour. At half- past twelve, it receives one tap; which is called " one bell." At one o'clock, it is tapped twice: that is, "two bells." At half-past one, it is tapped three times: that is, "three bells;" and so on, till four o'clock, which time is "eight bells.", Then at half- past four "one bell" is struck again; at five o'clock, "two bells;"' and so on, up to eight o'clock, which is, "eight bells," again. Commencing at half-past eight, "one bell" is again sounded, "two bells" at nine; and so on till twelve, when " eight bells" is reached once more. So, when the mate told me it was " seven bells," it will be perceived that it was half-past eleven. I tried to sleep again, and succeeded. How long I slept, I could not tell; but when I awoke again, the vessel was tossing about fearfully, and the waves dashing over her fore and aft, with a fierceness that threatened to burst her to pieces. But the wind had suddenly lulled. Not a breath of air was stirring; the lower main top-sail was flapping idly about; they had lost control of the ship, because she would no- longer steer when the wind ceased; and so, falling fairly into the trough of the sea, she could not struggle up over the billows; and there she lay at the mercy of the waves, being buffeted by them with- out any mercy at all. It was indeed a perilous time. The captain, with his many years of experience at sea, knew our danger; but what could he done? Should this state of things   CURIOSITY MORE THAN SATISFIED.   801 continue long, the ship must inevitably be beaten to pieces. All hands had been called on deck; and I got out of my bunk and struggled to the cabin-door. I opened it a little way, but a fearful sea swept over and dashed it shut in my face. I could hear the voice of the captain giving hurried commands to the sailors who were at work securing the rigging. The shrouds were growing slack, and it was every minute expect- ed that the masts would be carried away. No breeze came; and probably the angry sea would have crushed us down then and there, but that the clouds gathered thickly over, and a heavy rain came pattering upon the agitated waters-a very unusual accompaniment of a north-west wind. It may be wondered, by the uninitiated, how a heavy shower of rain could help us. It is not gener- ally known that rain has a soothing effect on the angry sea. Yet, such is the case. No matter how fiercely the waves are running, let the wind lull, and a brisk rain of an hour will take all the rough edge off them. It is the dashing and breaking waves that sailors dread. A regular swelling wave, no matter how high it towers, will do no harm, as a vessel will rise with it, and ride lightly over. This rain of twenty-five or thirty minutes, so far soothed the turbulent waves as to place us out of im- mediate danger; and not long after, the wind sprung up again, command of the ship was recovered, and so the night passed-and the morning of Sunday, the seventeenth of March, St. Patrick's Day, dawned upon the wide ocean. Thel wind was still blowinig- freshly, but the sky    <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6734-00000155"/> 802    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. was clear, the sun shining brightly, and the waves of the sea rolling within the pale of moderation. They still washed the deck at intervals, but I had got used to that, for the deck had scarcely been free from the briny water since the middle of the previous day. The officers and sailors all wore high rubber boots, and oil-cloth hats and clothes. But still, the water dashed over them so violently, that they were wet to the skin all the time. If any one ever asks you, dear reader, whether a sailor's life is a pleasant one or not, say "No!" A strong breeze blew all day, and as night ap- proached, it increased to a gale again. I had hoped the storm was over; but a storm at sea seldom sub- sides entirely within twenty-four hours. What we had experienced on Saturday night, was not to be compared with the terrors of that memora- ble Sunday night. I have suffered much, and under- gone much danger in my time, but I never, either before or since, passed such a terrible night. The gale grew fierce again-fiercer even than be- fore-and the lofty waves thundered over us so, that much of the time it was difficult to determine whether we were still floating or not. But the most fearful time was about midnight. Light clouds were hurrying over, driven by the mighty wind, while, at intervals, portions of the sky grew clear, and the moon shone down upon us. -It was an odd sight--such an awful tempest seen in the moonliglht. The wind blew with such violence that the ship was nearly the whole time on her beam-ends,   CURIOSITY MORE THAN SATISFIED.   303 that is, lying over on her side. At intervals she would struggle up for a moment, but the fierce blast would soon hurl her over again. On one occasion, while she stood up for a moment, the pumps were sounded, and the captain soon after called out, "Starboard watch to the pumps!" The fact was, the ship was found to be leaking badly, and the hold already contained about four-and- a-half feet of water 1 One of the mates informed me of this. I had requested him to be frank with me, and to let me know the full extent of any danger; stating, that if it became necessary for us to die, I would do my share of it with as good a grace as pos- sible under the circumstances. The crew of a vessel is divided into two watches-- one called the Starboard, and the other the Port. The port watch is commanded by the first mate, and the starboard by the second. [The port side of a ship is the left-hand side, the starboard the right.] While the starboard watch worked most energetically at the pamps, the port watch went aft with the captain and first mfate, and proceeded to heave cargo overboard. All that was cared for now was to save our lives, and to do that, the ship must be kept afloat. What cared we now for stores of wealth I The wealth of thlewhole world would not have been more highly regarded than an old rusty nail! What cared I for my trunk, my clothes, my books, money, papers, manuscripts, and little valuable and favorite trinkets! I could have seen them all, and a million times more, swept overboard into the dashing sea, without givilng them another thought.    <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6734-00000156"/> 804    JOHN SMTITH ON A CRUTCH. How faithfully those sailors worked! both at the pumps, and at the after-hatch, where the valuable cargo was being dashed from the ship, as though a sacrifice to appease the wrath of the billows! How quickly and submissively they sprung to execute every slight command! There was no tardiness now. They were working for dear life, and it was only necessary for them to know what to do. The com- mands of the officers were merely instructions. There was no cursing the sailors by the officers. [As for the captain, he seldom swore at the sailors; but the mates could do so, in mild weather, with a skill that no reasonable person could impeach.] There was no longer any distinction between officers and men. All appeared equal. All labored for a common end. Death, which lays every one low, with an impartial hand, was apparently near us, and we were comrades now. Kings and emperors, had they been aboard that seemingly doomed ship, must have felt that they were only men! I remained at the cabin door, most of the time, watching, at times---as the receding sea would allow me to open the door a little way--the second mate, Mr. Gorham, and his watch, working at the pumps, and the phosphorescent sparks chasing each other over the deck and out at the ports and scuppers. I could also see long lines of gleaming phosphorus on the crests of the waves far out upon the dreadful sea. The steward, who had been helping at the pnumps, made his way into the cabin for some purpose, and said to me, "Passenger, don't you tlink we're gone?"   CURIOSI TY MORE TNIAN SATISFIED.  305 His voice indicated that he had already abandoned all hope. "Things look rather gloomy," I replied. "' Well," he rejoined, " we have but once to die. If we go down, it will soon be over; we won't suffer long." This was all the consolation any of us had. The water in the hold did not decrease--the storm raged with unabated fury-and the question now, was not, "Shall we go down?" but, "I How soon 7"It seemed but a question of time. If we had a spark of hope left, it was merely as one compared with one hundred. The mate told me it was possible the ship could be kept afloat till morning, and that then it was possible some vessel might be in sight and come to our assist- ance. But these vague possibilities were worse than no hope at all. They were too tantalizing. I should really have felt better if I had known, beyond a doubt, that we should go down in ten minutes. Still, it is natural for man to cling to any hope that is held out to him, however slight. Probably, hope, faint as it was, saved us on this occasion. Had all given up, and sat down, with the conviction that we were lost-although no one on board was really of any other opinion-the ship would have filled in an hour, and we must have gone down to our dismal graves in the depths of the Gulf Stream. In this awful extremity, I could not help remem- bering certain verses from Byron's "Don Juan" which were very applicable to the occasion. I quote them: *20    <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6734-00000157"/> 306     JOHN  SMITH ON A CRUTC H.

"Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears In his rough eyes, and told the captain he Could do no more; he was a inan in years, And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea, And if he wept, at length, they were not fears That made his eyelids as a woman's be.; But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children- Two things for dying people quite bewildering.

The night passed-I scarcely know how-and, con- trary to our anticipation, morning found us still afloat. The storm was yet raging, and the sailors were still busy pumping and heaving cargo overboard. I took my position at the cabin door again, standing in water six or eight inches deep--for the water had made its way into the cabin, where my trunk was * Pedrillo, a licentiate who accompanied Don Juan, and was his tutor.   CURIOSITY MORE THAN SATISFIED.   807 leisurely soaking. I heard the first mate tell one of the sailors to climb up to thh mast-head and keep a look out for a vessel. Shortly afterward he came to the door, held it a little way open and said: "Mr. Smith, just glance out! There is the wildest sight I ever saw, during all my experience at sea " And he pointed to windward. I looked; but how shall I describe that sublime and awful picture! The sun was shining brightly, the wind blowing so fiercely that it shattered the green waves, lifted up the waters bodily and dis- persed them into a thick spray, so that I could not discern where sea and sky met. The next moment we were enveloped in such a cloud that we could not see thirty yards around us; the heavens grew black and it began to look like the dusk of evening. A minute later, the clouds had swept over, and the bright sun burst once more upon that scene of fear- ful grandeur. Never did the god of day shed light on a wilder picture,! It was grand-majestically grand-awfully grand, beyond the expression of human tongue! Notwithstanding our prospect of speedy death, I was lost and swallowed up in momen- tary admiration. How vividly came to my mind, as I stood there gazing on the tempestuous scene, those sublime words from the one-hundred-and-seventh- Psalm-words that I had never before properly ap- preciated-- "They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; "These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.    <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6734-00000158"/> 308    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth, uip the waves thereof. "They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble. "They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end." Presently the whole wild picture was again wrapped in gloom, and I was only conscious of the thunder of the waves beating over the ship, of the howling wind and dashing, blinding spray; a moment of gloom: then the clouds were dashed away by the wind, the sun burst out and the wild day shone round again. We were in the Gulf Stream, which is of a warmer temperature than the other waters of the Atlantic in the same latitude; and the cooler wind seemed to grasp the water up and dash it into the sky; so that, at times, as the spray mounted up and formed in clouds, the sea and sky appeared to leave their places, rush- ing about through space and commingling in unutter- able confusion. In the midst of all this, how frail did our ship seem!-so frail, that I fancied it lived only because the battling elements did not deign to notice it, or think it worth their while to crush it, as they might *have done with a breath! But now, a beam of hope dawned on us; and it could be seen shining on the faces of all. Every countenance was radiant with it. There was, at last, after eight hours of constant pumping, a perceptible decrease of water in the hold. Sixty or seventy tons   CURIOSITY MORE THAN SATISFIED.   309 of cargo had been thrown from the after part of the ship; the carpenter had gone down and succeeded in patching up one of the rifts: and, to our joy, it was found that the pumps were now capable of throwing the water out a little faster than it ran in. Although the gale was still blowing, and many planks had been torn from the bulwarks by the waves, imminent death no longer threatened us, and we felt compara- tively happy. All that day, (Monday,) that night, and a portion of the following day, the storm raged. But on Tuesday afternoon it gradually lulled, and on Wednesday morning the sun smiled cheerfully on a nearly smooth sea. A slight breeze was blowing, the sky was clear and blue, the air perfectly charming; and I began to forget the terrors and dangers of the storm through which we had passed. After all, now, it was pleasant to be at sea. Of course, such a thing as proceeding on a voyage of fifteen thousand miles was not to be thought of; and the captain put back for New York, which was now about seven hundred miles distant, as we had drifted a long way during the north-west gale. That beautiful morning, as I went up on the after deck-a deck, usually called the poop deck, which surrounds the cabin, and is raised about three or four feet above the main deck-I met the captain walking to and fro, and he said: "Well, Mr. Smith, taking into consideration our recent gale, what do you think of the man who wrote ' A life on the ocean wave?'" "One of two thhings," I replied: " he was either a    <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6734-00000159"/> 310    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH.  lunatic, or else never saw the ' ocean wave.' In the latter case, he was, at least, a fool." "That," rejoined the captain, " reminds me of-a certain Doctor-a friend of mine--who once took a voyage with me. He was much elated with the idea of going to sea, and, as we sailed from port, and he gazed out upon the endless expanse before us, he was perfectly enraptured. But, by and by, as we got out where it was a little rough, he became sea-sick-terri. bly so-and I found him aft, in a little while, hanging over the bulwark, and ready to turn inside out. O, wasn't he sick! ' Hallo, Doctor,' said I; ' not sick, I hope?' ' O, Lordy! yes,' said he. '0, dear!' Then I thought his stomach itself would come up. ' What do you now think of the man who wrote, 4'A life on the ocean wave?"I was cruel enough to ask. ' Think!' said he. 'I think-bawk!-think he was a d  d fool! Bawk! Bawk!

WX[ITH Thursday morning came an east wind: it was moderate, at first, but freshened up, and -) y blew positively strong; the sky became heavi- ly overcast with clouds, the rain fell--.so did the mer- cury in the barometer--and there was every indica- tion of an easterly gale. Still, as night came on, and it had not yet amounted to a gale, the ship was kept running before the wind -under her three lower top-sails, and we made pretty good time toward New York. I retired that night not quite at ease, but still suffi- ciently so to rest well; and as the vessel was kept before the wind all night, and did not rock much, I didn't tumble out of my berth, as one may reasonably expect to do when the vessel rolls heavily. I am not in the habit of paying any attention to dreams, or of relating them; but one that visited me that night was so inexpressibly ludicrous, that I must "out with it." I dreamed that I, in company with a very black African, armed with an axe,/was in a deep, thick wood in California, looking for a pole to make sled-soles of, when a big bear made his appearance, and immediate-    <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6734-00000160"/> 312    JOH' SMITH ON A CRUTCH. ly!"went for" us. The darkey dropped the axe, sprung upon a stump near by, and squatted on the top of it, trembling with terror; but I, not being in a condition, to retreat with speed, caught up the axe, threw down my crutch, balanced myself on my foot, and as the bear came on and reared up to hug me to death, I aimed a blow at his head. But it missed his head and cut off one of his fore-paws-a bear hasfour of them, you know-the blood spurting forth from the stump, in a way that was quite gratifying to me. He was not placed heors du combat, however, but per. sisted in his attack on me with extraordinary vigor. I aimed another blow at the seat of his intellect; but, singularly enough, missed it again, and cut off the other fore-paw. As I did so, the axe flew from my hands, and fell at the foot of a big tree, thirty feet distant. The bear, not yet discomfitted, growled savagely, showed his teeth, and came dancing at me, holding up his bloody stumps, as though still -deter- mined, even with them, to. crush me. Finding my- self unarmed, and without so much leisure time as to pick up my crutch, I turned about and made a hop toward the stump on which the darkey sat. The bear hopped after me. I had thought of climbing up on the stump, but the frightened darkey occupied all the space there; so I just kept on retreating round the stump, hopping as fast as I could, and close at my heel came the bloody bear, hopping, too, as fast as he could. The whole picture, with the scared nigger on the stump in the center,-his thick lips mumbling unin- telligible words of frighlt, and his white eyes starting out so that they could have been knocked off with a   MORE OF THE DREADFUL SEA.     313 club, without touching his flat nose-was so unprece- dentedly ludicrous, that terrified, as I fancied I was, I laughed outright, in the very midst of my visionary peril; and so awoke. It was daylight; the roar of the agitated sea struck on my ear; the waves were dashing over the stern of the ship and rolling over the roof of the cabin; the winds were howling without; the ship was plunging and pitching, rising in the misty air and sinking into the depths among the waves: it was blowing a regular gale. I got up and was making my way toward the cabin door, when the captain entered. "Good-morning," said I. "How are things now?" "O," he replied, in a tone of vexation, " about as bad as they can be, this side of the bottom. We have an easterly gale to contend with, and the ship is still before the wind. I wanted to run as long as I could,. in order to get out of this cursed Gulf Stream. Now, I am half afraid to heave the ship to, lest it should strain her. Every thing goes wrong. This is the most unlucky voyage of my life. I have followed the sea for twenty years; I have been in innumerable ,gales; I have had ships burnt under me; I have been shipwrecked on coasts; I have run upon icebergs, and been attacked by pirates; but never had such continued ill-luck. I hoped the other gale would have been enough for one trip. We got out of that by barely a hair's-breadth; and now, in our crippled condition, before we have time to get out of the Gulf Stream, wev have a black, blustering easterly gale rushing upon us. If it lasts as long as the other, we JH    <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6734-00000161"/> 314    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. must either go to the bottom or be driven upon the coast. Nothing can save us." "Too bad," said I, taking advantage of a momen- tary lull, to attempt to walk across the cabin. But just then the ship gave a fearful lurch, and I was dashed violently back upon a sofa, striking, upon the back of it, that leader in the elbow commonly styled the " crazy-bone," and temporarily paralyzing my arm. "Are you hurt?" asked the captain. "Only my arm," I replied, grasping the back of the sofa with my other hand to keep from rolling off. ' Only my arm. It, I am inclined to believe, is broken." "I hope not." My arm was so paralyzed that I could not move it for a quarter of a minute; when, as it began to re- cover from the benumbing effects of the shock, it tingled in a way that was agonizing. It was not broken, however, but badly bruised. "I think," said the captain, "you must be the Jonah of this ship. It is said when ships are un- fortunate, that they have a Jonah on board. IlHadn't we better throw you overboard?" "If you will insure me a safe voyage to land in a whale's stomach," I replied, "you may do so. If it will take me to New York in three days and three nights, I think I will reach land much sooner than this leaky old ship." "I don't know," he rejoined. "We may reach the nearest point of land much sooner." "Where is that," I asked.   MORE OF THE DREADFUL SEA.      315 't The bottom." The gale did not grow so fierce that day as our northwestern gale had done; but still it was a bigger gale than any man need wish for. Two of the men were severely injured at the wheel, and had to be conveyed to the forecastle and stowed away. Moreover, one or two others had fallen ill, from sheer exhaustion; and as the crew only numbered twenty-three, including officers, steward, and carpen- ter, this was a considerable diminution of force. The ship leaked as badly as ever, and the pumps had to be kept going continually. That night, in the midst of the gale, the wind hushed suddenly, as on the night of the sixteenth, while the sea was running high, and left us again struggling in a trough of the sea. "At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are As human beings' during civil war." Htowever, it was soon blowing again, and the captain, who wanted to get across the Gulf Stream as soon as possible-for the sea is always more turbulent there than elsewhere-put the ship before the wind, determined to run her "as long as she would float." ;,      ' *     <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6734-00000162"/> 316    JO1N SMITH ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER XL111. JOHN   jMTH'S END  JMMNENT. 2Y morning--Saturday, the twenty-third of March --a fearful gale was blowing, and the weather was so heavy that the dismal, misty clouds seemed to float on the bosom of the sea. The ship was leaking worse than ever, the water in the hold was actually gaining; and the second mate, who was on watch, told the captain that unless the vessel was hove to soon, she must go down, as it was impossible, with the gale astern-the chief leakage being aft--to keep her from filling. The captain told him to call all hands on deck at once; and he came to the cabin door and called the first mate. Mr. Trufant, the first mate, " turned out " hastily, put on his water-proof clothes, and stepped forth on deck. Just then a heavy sea swept over and carried him off his feet, dashing him against the starboard bulwark, where both his feet slipped under one of the spare spars that was loosely lashed there, and was floating on the water. As the wave receded, and the the water ran off through the rents in the bulwarks, the spar settled down again, its immense weight rest- ing on one of his legs, which he could not withdraw in time. He uttered an exclamation of pain, and Mr.   JOHN SMITH'S END IMMNENT.   , 317 Gorham and the sailors at the pumps, hurried to his assistance. They could not move the heavy spar, and the unfortunate man was obliged to lie there, suf- fering the most excruciating pain, till another sea swept over, half-drowning him, and floated it again. Then Mr. Gorham and the sailors hastily dragged him from the bulwark, and carried him, groan- ingi and fainting, into the cabin. His leg Mwas broken about five inches below the knee. Here then was another important portion of our force rendered useless; to say nothing of the depress- ing influence their officer's misfortunes and sufferings had on the sailors, who, like most seamen, were su- perstitious, and were heard declaring that the BREW- STER was an ' unlucky ship." Mr. Trufant was an exemplary seaman, and could have handled the ship as well as the captain. At this most distressing time, the gale grew more violent than ever; heavy seas swept over from stern to stenm, in rapid succession; the main hatch-house was stove to pieces; both galley doors were stove in, and the sea dashed through, putting out the fires, washing away provisions and important utensils, and hurling the steward out -against the bulwark, and almost overboard; nearly all the remaining planks of the bulwarks were torn away; the wheel-house began to go to pieces; the lower fore top-sail was blown to ribbons; and the ship broached to-that is, came round into the trough of the sea, and lay with her side to the wind and waves. The captain hurried out upon the after-deck, had the lower mizzen top-sail taken in, and ordered the    <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6734-00000163"/> 318    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. lower main top-sail to be braced so that the ship should lie close to the wind, and steer over the waves. This done, he returned to the cabin, and he and I ' set"Mr. Trufant's broken leg-and a de uce of a "set" we made of it. I had read " anatomy " in my time, and fancied I knew something of surgery and the general construction of the human frame; but, tossing about as the ship was at that time, the most skillful surgeon could scarcely have done justice to the case. Only the tibia-that is, the large bone of the leg- was broken, and we applied three splints to it, boulnd it too tightly, with too much bandage, and fancied we had "reduced the fracture," in a scientific manner. When we arrived in New York Harbor, nine days later, and the mate was taken to the Brooklyn City Hospital, the surgeons there had to set it over again, and attach a forty-pound weight to the foot to keep it in its place. Our troubles were not over when Mr. Trufant's ac- cident occurred. Another man at the wheel had his shoulder dislocated, and was carried to the forecastle. Every wave that swept over did some additional damage--crushing in a panel of the house on deck, or tearing a plank from the bulwarks. Mr. Gorham told the captain that the water in the hold was increasing, and that one of the two pumps was out of order. The rigging gre, w slack again; the shrouds had endured such a strain that some of them were beginning to give way and were flapping loosely in the wind: and it began to be pretty clear that the main-mast would soon go.   JOHN SMITH'S END IMMNENT.    319 The sky was not quite so. heavy as it had been; and the captain went aft with his glass and anxiously scanned the horizon. There was a schooner in sight, three or four miles to windward, and as she rose on the waves we could see her distinctly. So, he went into the cabin, got an odd-looking flag from his private state-room, took it out and hoisted it at the mizzen-mast. It was a signal of distress. "Mr. Gorham," he shouted, " don't give it up! Keep the pump going! She may not see us!" "Ay, ay, sir!" responded the brave mate. "I will not give it up!--Work away with a will, men!" The remaining effective -pump was worked with unusual energy for half-an-hour; during which time, I climbed up the companion-way, went out on the stormy after-deck, clung to a rope with which the wheel-housewas lashed, and anxiously watched the schooner. She was standing several points off, and did not change her course. Whether she had failed to see our signal, or was herself in a bad condition, or both, I am unable to say: but she moved on, and finally grew dim at the misty horizon. Again the captain scanned the ocean on all sides; but no sail was in sight. He then, with an air of sad- ness and disappointment, hauled down the signal. Next, he went to Mr. Gorham, and asked him how the water was. There was no hope in that direction. He could not tell how much water was in the hold, but any one could see that the ship was slowly settling. If any one had mentioned hope to us now, we would have laughed at him-laughed with the wild laugh of despair!    <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6734-00000164"/> 320    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. A thousand thoughts of home and friends came crowding upon me; and I wondered how many months the fathomless waters would roll over me- how many months I should lie entangled, perhaps, among some slimy sea-weeds, if not immediately de- voured by the monsters of the deep, before the dear ones, whom I had seen for the last time, would give me up for lost. They could never know how I perished, I mused; none would be left to tell the tale. In an hour, perhaps the waves would be dashing a thousand fathoms above us all. Time would roll on, the BREWSTER would never be heard of, no letter from San Francisco would ever bear to my friends the welcome words, "All is well!"Years would pass away-no tidings of the wanderer--one by one, all who were dear tQ me would grow old and die, and sink down into the grave, thinking of the lost one who disappeared in the dim years gone by, and wondering how he died! These thoughts were saddening indeed to one who believed that his end was nigh; but I remembered that no fretting, or repining, or yearning for loved facV, could at all help the matter; and made up my mind to die like a man! The captain returned to the after-deck, and I went down into the cabin and stayed with Mr. Trufant, whose sufferings, as the vessel tossed about, were indeed heartrending. He was a brave fellow, though, and stood it with fortitude. He had served in the navy, and his face was disfigured from the explosion of a shell; and he told me he had been unlucky all   JOHN SMITH S END IMMNENT.   321 his life. He did not know the extent of our danger -and I did not tell him-and related some of his misfortunes, as I sat there on a sofa, near his berth, clinging to it to retain my seat. He said that, only a year before, he had met with an accident on a ship, had nearly been crushed by a falling yard, that it had taken him eight or nine months to recover, during which time he had spent, in doctor-bills, and the like, all the hard-earned money he had saved up in the course of years; that now, just when he had got able to start on a voyage again, with hopes of a brighter future, this sad accident had occurred, and would lay him up for months, should we reach shore. It was hard, he said, after what he had suffered in the navy; and I thought so, too. Well, his misfortunes and sorrows, my misfortunes and sorrows, and the misfortunes and sorrows of the whole crew would soon have ended, had the storm continued so much as an hour longer. But at six bells-vulgarly called on land, eleven o'clock--it began to abate, as though its very strength was ex- hausted; and by evening, had entirely subsided. The ship was again comparatively relieved from water; and there's no use in any ordinary mortal attempting to give a passable description of our joy, as we found ourselves once more basking in the full light of hope! 21    <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6734-00000165"/> 322    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER    XLIV. fOUtTESIES AT   SEA. \EXT day, (Sunday,) a fresh north-west breeze blew all day, and we made but little progress toward New York. The weather was pleasant, and the ship did not leak so much as before. The sailors were busy all day, repairing the damages, as best they could, securing the rigging and so forth ; the carpenter nailed some boards on the almost bare framework of the bulwarks, made another inspection of the hold, and got some of the leaks stopped: espe- cially did he secure one of the stern planks, that was so loose that a man might have pulled it off with his hands. On Monday morning, the sea was perfectly calm. NKot the slightest breeze stirred, the surface of the watler was glassy, and scarcely any swell was percep- tible.  [They have swells at sea, as well as on land.] By and by, as we laid perfectly motionless, we saw a steamer coming from  the southward, and the cap- tain ran up his" ensign," as a signal that he wanted to communicate with her. It was the Moro Castle, from  Havana for New York.  As she passed astern of us, within half a cable's length, Captain Collins called out:   COURTESIES AT SEA.      823 "This is the BREWSTER, leaking badly and return- ing in distress! Please report me in New York!" "Ay, ay," replied the captain of the steamer, as she rushed by. On Monday evening, a stiff north-west breeze sprung up again, as though determined to keep us away from New York harbor; and it lasted a whole week. On Thursday, the twenty-eighth, after we had been tacking about for three days without gaining much distance, a -pilot-boat came dancing out to us, over the rough waves, and a pilot left her in a yawl and came aboard the BREWSTER. "HAVE YOU ANY NEWSPAPERS?" was the ques. tion the captain and I asked him, in a breath, as he came up over the bulwark. I shall never forget the anxiety and impatience with which we asked this question. We had been absent from the world, as it were, about three weeks: and so full of terror and danger had the period been that it seemed like a moderate life-time. I almost fancied that my country might have undergone a revolution during my absence, and that I might find it necessary, on going ashore, to bend my solitary knee to a crowned monarch. However, I saw no indications of any such state of things, in the World, Herald and Times with which the pilot responded to our earnest inquiries. Things seemed to be going on about as usual in Gotham, and the remainder of the United States: the markets!appeared to be good; whisky, cotton and iron were quoted at fair figures: while the usual healthy number of fires, accidents and murders were reported in the proper columns.  r     <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6734-00000166"/> 824    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. On Monday morning, the first day of April, having been all this time beating about in front of the harbor, we found ourselves becalmed again, about seventy miles from New York. The sky was heavily clouded, a dull, damp, misty rain fell, and the barometer was low. Every thing augured ugly weather. Sound- ings were taken, which indicated that we were in fifty fathoms water. Other sails could be seen on all sides. By and by, we saw a small side-wheel steamer coming toward us, from the direction of the harbor; whereupon the captain said to the pilot: "Don't you think that's a steamer coming to take us in tow?" "It looks very like it," was the reply. The captain then called the carpenter and instructed him to remove from the stern of the ship the board on which the name BREWSTER was painted. "What is that for, Captain?"I asked. "Don't you know?" he replied. No." "How dull you are," said he. "You would be dull, too," I retorted, " if you had never been out of sight of land but three or four times in your life. But, tell me--what is it for?" "Why, you see, we have already been reported in distress; and if that fellow coming should recognize us, he would ask a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars to tow us in." "Ah?" said I, somewhat enlightened. "Is that their style?" "Yes, indeed: let them get a fellow in a tight place   COURTESIES AT SEA.      325 once, as ywe are now, and they'll pile it on-no telling how high.-Hurry, carpenter." The steamer reached us at last, crossed our stern, and, with a graceful curve, came round on our port side, within hailing distance. "Good morning," said the captain of the little steamer-the WM. FLETCHER-who stood in the pilot-house. "Good morning," returned Captain Collins. "Where are you from?" asked the steamer captain, looking curiously at the blank place where the BREWSTER's name ought to have been. "San Francisco," responded Captain Collins. ' "What vessel?" This was a stunner, and Collins, after hesitating a moment, pretended not to have heard, and said: "How do the Highlands bear from here?" "About north-west," was the response. "What ves-- " "What will you charge to tow me in?" interrupted Captain Collins. "Three hundred dollars," was the prompt reply. "O, nonsense," rejoined Collins. "That's too much. That's all they charge when the harbor is full of ice." "Our regular price," said the other. "O, no, captain," said Collins; "come, be reason- able. I'll give you a hundred and fifty." "Couldn't do it, really." "Well," rejoined Collins, "I think we will have a favorable wind soon, and I can get in without being towed."    <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6734-00000167"/> 826    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "Yes," retorted the other, ironically; a' quite likely. If you have no barometer on board, I'll lend you one. The mercury has gone clean down but of sight, and we're going to have a deuce of a. blow. I'll venture it will be a nor'-wester, too." "Pooh! No danger. I'll sail in." "All right," said the steamer captain. "Now that I come to think, I'm sorry I made so good an offer. I begin to believe you have an underwriter's job of it. You haven't been to San Francisco." "I'll give you two hundred dollars," said Collins, without paying any attention to the other's last re- mark. "No, not a cent lower than three hundred. I wouldn't do it for that, if I had not already offered to. I'll swear, I believe that is the BREWSTER! We heard of it." "The what?" said Collins. "The BREWSTER. Come, isn't it now? Captain Adams, of the M1oro Castle, reported her returning in distress." "What do I know of the Blueskin? I never heard of such a ship.--Come, I'll give you two hundred and fifty." "No, three hundred; not a cent less. I'll put you alongside the pier for that." "O, you're a hard one! Well, you can tow us in, and I'll lick you the first time I catch you in New York. Mind, now, you are to take the ship to the pier whenever I want you to. I will anchor in the harbor to-day." "All right; I'll stick to that."   COURTESiES5 A'T Dl!;A, t6E  t Well, Mr. Gorham, give him our hawser." "Ay, ay, sir." The hawser is a very thick, heavy line, used for towing or making a ship fast; and one end of this rope the sailors gladly threw over to the steamer, while the other was made fast to the capstan on the forecastle deck. We arrived in the harbor about four o'clock that afternoon, and had just cast anchor when we were visited with a rough north-west gale. But we did not care now, we were safe. We anchored near Hart's Island, and I got on the little steamer, with Captain Collins, and went up to the city. We landed at the foot of Catharine street, and my glad heart never before bounded as it did when, after the perils of the past three weeks, I stepped upon terra firma once more. I felt that I wouldn't care if somebody would knock a hole in the bottom of the nasty old sea and let all the salty water run out. It isn't of any use, anyhow, only to raise sharks, and whales, and mermaids, and porpoises, and sea-horses, and sea-serpents, and such like hideous creatures, to float iron-clads and 'drown people; and for idiots that never saw it to write pretty verses' about. I am not habitually a fighting man; on the contrary, quite a peaceably-disposed citizen of the United States; but if I ever come across the cuss that wrote, "A life on the ocean wave, A home on the rolling deep; 'Where the scattered waters rave; And the winds their revels keep" I'll lick him or he'll lick me!    <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6734-00000168"/> OZo    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. CHAPTER    XLV. fO I FOR J; ALIFOR'NIA! A BOUT the middle of April, a little more than a year after my fearful experience on board the BREWSTER, I might have been seen, (if anybody had been watching), in the vicinity of the Pacific Steamship Company's buildings, at the foot of Canal street, New York, making inquiry as to the rates of passage from New York to San Francisco. I had about recovered from my maritime scare. "One hundred dollars, first cabin," said the clerk; seventy-five dollars second; and forty dollars steer- age. The cabin tickets, however, are all sold. We have but a few steerage tickets left." "The deuce!"I exclaimed, forgetting my good manners, in the agony of disappointment. It was two days prior to the sailing of the Ocean Queen. I did not like the idea of going in the steer- age, for I had been informed that it was "rough," and that even a soldier would find it so; nor did I relish waiting eight days for the next steamer. "Pshaw!"I ejaculated. "You wanted a cabin ticket, I suppose?" "Couldn't think of going in the steerage; I have distant relations who have been in Congress."   HO! FOR CALIFORNIA!      329 You might," he said, with some hesitation, "be crowded into the cabin, but I have no cabin ticket to sell you. If you will take a steerage ticket, I am confident you can arrange it with the purser to get transferred to the cabin." "Do you think so?" "I am sure of it." ' Then I will take one." I paid forty dollars, and the clerk filled out a steerage ticket' for me-which I took with thanks, and walked away, fancying I had learned a great secret. It- was a great secret, for I afterward discovered that it was necessary to intrust it to a great many people in order to have it well kept. The day the Ocean Queen sailed was a rainy, dismal day. The steamer was crowded, and it required the neatest bit of skill to set one's crutch down any- where on the steerage deck without injuring any one's toes. There were more than fourteen hundred pas- sengers aboard. The steamer did not get out of the harbor 'before five o'clock, and the purser being busy collecting tickets, I was unable to see him in order to make that little " arrangement ;" and as night closed in and we plunged out among the waves of the mighty deep, II felt myself doomed to " turn in" in the steerage. How shall I describe that night of horror? It fairly tak'es away my appetite to think of it! As the shores disappeared in the darkness and distance, a strong wind blew, the waves rolled savagely, then    <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6734-00000169"/> 330    JOHN SMTITH ON A CRUTCIT. began thlat pitching and tossing of the vessel ,so terri- ble to the stomlachs of the unsailor-]ike. No sooner had we got "outside" and some slight C" motion" was perceptible, than some of the more susceptible passengers grew blue under the eyes and white as a sheet all over the face, and proceeded to manifest their regret for having dined, by violently casting up the masticated provisions, to the celebra- ted and, popular tune of "New York!"Then, as the vessel went plunging on, growing more and more reckless in its manner of tossing itself about, others began to feel the wretched reeling of the brain and morbid heaviness of the stomach-others grew sick, while the already sick grew sicker-others turned deathly pale, groaned in agony, gasped, shrieked "New York!" and let their recently-procured nourishlent rush out with a gush, and gush out with a rush; while a wild, agonizing chorus of "O, deary!" " O, Lordy!" "Oo-oo oo-Godbemerciful," and the like, re- sounded and reverberated through the ship, penetra- ted dark recesses and corners, mingled with the dash of the- surging waves without, and the dull splash of repudiated nutrition on the main deck within. As for myself-I wasn't exactly sick; I'll never acknowledge that I was, as long as I live. That I felt slightly indisposed-just enough so not to feel in the humor for receiving visitors-I will not deny; but it was not sea-sickness. It was only a kind of nausea and dizziness, accompanied by violent spasms just be neath the lungs and a rapid ejectment from  the stomach of some trifling article of food that didn't agree with me-under the circumstances. I am sub-   IO. FOE CALIFORNIAI      831 jest to these spells-usually on the water. On such occasions, the natural depression of spirits makes me rather morose, and I am not apt to talk much. On the occasion in question, all I said was "New York," when a man asked another where he was from, and I thought he was talking to me. I should have said "Philadelphia," instead of "New York," but I didn't care much, just then, where I was from. Realizing that I had articulated when I was not spoken to, I was about to excuse myself when the vessel plunged violently, and I simply said, "O, Lordy! Ugh 1" Such was all the conversation I indulged in that night. I went to the purser next dav-late in the day, for I felt better in the afternoon than in the morning--told him the circumstances, and requested him to make that little " arrangement ;" stating that I was willing to pay the difference. He said the cabin was crowded, but that, in consideration of about thirty- five dollars, he could probably find me a place. This I paid him; and, to make the matter short, I paid thirty-five more in gold on the other side-that is, from Panama to San Francisco--making in all about one hundred and twenty-five dollars for the luxury of a voyage to San Francisco. In a day or two, I was able to stagger about the vessel in a very successful manner, considering my means of perambulating, and on the first Sunday out -three days from New York-the weather being fine, I wended my way forward to give a drink of wine to a sick steerage-passenger, and it was on that    <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6734-00000170"/> 332    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. occasion that I witnessed a very amusing scene which I shall endeaver to describe. My sick friend was lying on the hurricane deck, shaded by an awning, and very near him were four unchristian-like passengers engaged in the absorbing game of " seven-up." About that time, a Methodist minister came over from the cabin to conduct a "divine service " or two, and enlighten the benighted i steerage-passengers as to the great probability of their losing their immortal souls. He took his position a little way from our " seven- up" party, gave out a text from memory, and pro- ceeded to preachl the gospel-duringo which the game went on-my attention being divided between it and the sermon. "My Christian friends," began the minister, "I would have you know, in the beginning, that --" ["You're bound to trump or follow suit, if you have it," interrupted one of the card-players.] ". -- There are two--- ["Trumps! by jingo!"] "--- Spheres of existence for all mankind.

FOR CALIFORNIA!      335 variety, began to lose its interest, and I returned to the cabin much edified by the preaching and that scientifically played game of "seven-up." I will not attempt to give a full account of the incidents of the voyage from New York to Aspinwall -a distance of nineteen hundred and eighty-three nautical miles-but will conclude this chapter by mentioning the death of a middle-aged lady, who died the day before our arrival in port. She had been ill of pneumonia for some days, and early on the morn- ing in question she breathed her last, leaving a sorrow-stricken husband and eight children to con- tinue the voyage and life's cheerless journey, without the light of a wife's and mother's smile. The children were all small-the oldest not more than ten years old-and were not able to realize their loss and their desolate condition; but that heart- broken man, whose haggard face and dark sunken eyes I can never forget, mourned enough for all. Every innocent prattle of the motherless ones was a thrust into his stricken heart, and if they did not weep he wept for them. I have seen many horrible sights, such as the mangling of men in battle; but I never saw any thing so calculated to make the heart weep as the sorrow of that lone-hearted father of motherless children. Never can I forget how I saw him, just after a dull splash aft of the leeward wheel announced that the corpse had been committed to the deep, come languid- ly out of his stateroom, surrounded by his wondering little ones, sit down on the deck under the shadow of    <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6734-00000172"/> 336    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. a companion-way, bury his face in his hands, and weep like a lone and friendless child! It is sad to see a woman weep; but when a strong man sheds tears they must be wrung out by an anguish of soul too poignant for the simple name of grief!   ON THE ISTHMUS.        37 CHAPTER      XLVI. PN THE   JSTHMUS. ARLY on the morning of the ninth day from New York we landed at Aspinwall, New Gra- nada, United States of Columbia. The eastern shores of this country, which is a portion of Central America, are washed by the Caribbean Sea. Aspin- wall is composed of a score of substantial buildings, such as we see in our own country, and a few hun- dred thatched huts. A few Americans and Europeans are engaged    in business there; but it might be suggested that the natives are the chief feature in the population. These natives are a remarkable people--a true type of a mongrel race. We see among them every shade of complexion, from the hue of midnight in a coal-pit to that of wood ashes mixed with lime. Having stated that they are a mongrel people, it is but proper to say what races they are composed of, as nearly as I can guess, and I will do so in a tabular manner, thus: Caucasian .............     11 per cent. American....................... 191 " Mongolian......................... O ' " Australian. .................... 1  " Arctic .................. ........ O " Malay ..............."..... O. "  European ....... ................. 1 " Ethiopian ...................... 77 " Amounting to          100 22    <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6734-00000173"/> 338    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. They speak the Spanish tongue: how well I am unable to judge, as I am unfaniliar with that lan- guage; but, considering the general character of the benighted creatures, it is fair to presume that they cold-bloodedly murder it. They seldom address each other by name, but style each other Hlombre (pronounced almost Ulmbra, with a frightful quiver on the " r "): which is equivalent to "Fellow." As I before remarked, they have all shades of color; and I will add, that while some have straight, black, glossy hair, like that of the aborigines, others "sport" the fearfully-" kinked" article, like that of the pure African. They are a mean, cowardly, pusillanimous set. They cheat, lie, swear, get drunk, steal, murder, etc., with great nonchalance: and for the last-named crime their law condemns the criminal to imprisonment--for one year. There is a railroad, belonging to an American com- pany, running from Aspinwall to Panama, a distance of forty-seven miles. Panama, it will be remembered, is on the Pacific side of the Isthmus. In this connec- tion, I  will remark, that persons sometimes find it difficult to remember which of the two cities, Aspin- wall and Panama, is on the Atlantic side, and which on the Pacific.  A rule that will always enable one to remember it is, that the initial letter of each city is the same as that of the ocean on whose shore it stands. Aspinwall, beginning with the letter A, is on the Atlantic side; Panama, with P, on the Pacific. No one will forget this.   ON THE ISTHMUS.    '  339 During our ride in the cars from Aspinwall to Panama, we saw hundreds of natives-all wearing about the same appearance as those in Aspinwall. One remarkable feature was, that their children were running about in a state of nudity that was quite shocking to modest persons. Children under twelve years wear no raiment from the neck down, and usually go bare-headed. Even the adult males wear nothing but hat and breeches, and are therefore always in trim for a pugilistic encounter. Some of the ladies wear only a petticoat and a cigar. It is fashionable for the ladies there to " use the weed." Panama is a much larger and more' important place than Aspinwall. Its population is probably ten thousand. There are many more houses of respect- able appearance there, among which are several hotels. There are also two antiquated Catholic churches, one of which is said to be nearly two hundred years old. A dilapidated old wall surrounds the city, but it would prove a feeble protection against a civilized navy. The weather is extremely-hot all the year, the tem- perature never falling much below ninety degrees Fahrenheit. The heat is not so-extreme, however, during the " rainy season," which comprises our fall, and a portion of our summeePand winter months. All kinds of tropical fruits grow there in abundance. I saw oranges, lemons, limes, bananas, pineapples, co- coanuts, and other fruits, on the trees. The natives obtain these fruits by merely gathering them, and do a good business by selling them to travelers, at prices which, though lower than New York prices, are there considered enormous.    <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6734-00000174"/> 340     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. In justice to these natives, I will say that travelers %who conduct themselves with propriety, are always civilly treated by them. But it is not safe to injure or abuse them, where they are in such a decided ma- jority; for, like most cowards, they are brutal and vicious, and, if irritated, do not hesitate to murder foreigners. Many, no doubt, remember the terrible riot that occurred in Panama, a dozen years ago, between foreigners and natives. It was occasioned by one rascally drunken passenger, who managed to raise a dispute with a fruit-vender, and concluded to settle the matter by knocking over the fruit-stand and shooting at the owner. Thus it originated: the na- tives making an assault on the offender, and his fellow- passengers attempting to defend him. The riot soon became general; and the military of the New Grana- dian Government being called out to quell the dis. turbance, did so by wantonly shooting down every white man that came in their way. The slaughter was fearful. It should be a warning to all coarse and reckless fools, like the originator of this difficulty, who do not know how to conduct themselves with common decency in a foreign country.   THE "GOLDEN CITY."      341 CHAPTER    XLVII. THE I FOLDEN CITY. TX TE embarked at Panama on the steamer "Golden W Age," the same day we landed at Aspinwall, / and made the passage to San Francisco in four- teen days-touching at the ports of Acapulco and Manzanillo, Mexico-coaling at the former place. The distance from Panama to San Francisco is three thousand two hundred and sixty-seven nautical miles, according to the record of our- run. Manzanillo is about midway between the two places, while Acapulco is about three hundred miles nearer Panama. I will not trouble the reader with the details of this voyage, but, simply stating that we arrived in the grand harbor of San Francisco early in May, and landed early one pleasant Sunday morning, I will proceed to tell what kind of place it is, and relate what befell the redoubtable John Smith there. First, I will briefly mention the peculiarities of San Francisco, commencing with- THE CLIMATE.--In San Francisco, as well as along the whole coast of California and Oregon, the tem- perature of the air does not vary much during the year. There are no extremes of heat or cold. The trade winds prevail during the summer, and there is    <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6734-00000175"/> v -i    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. no rain except in the winter months-the period of the "rainy season." It seldom snows or freezes-and never to any considerable extent. In the summer the thermometer seldom indicates a higher degree of temperature than eighty. This would be rather warm, but for the steady breeze that sweeps in from the broad Pacific. THE HARBOR of San Francisco has not, probably, an equal in the world. The entrance is narrow, and tall, abrupt hills stand guard on either side. This en- trance is termed the "Golden Gate." The harbor is large enough to float all the vessels in the world; it is adorned with several picturesque islands; and its shores, where not occupied with buildings, are beauti- ful and green, except on the south side near the en- tralce, where immense heaps (almost mountains) of salld are the prevailing feature. THE POPULATION was fifty-six thousand in 1860 iccording to the National Census, but it is now hree inzes as great. It is, of course, composed of people omn all parts of the world, but chiefly from the United 3tates. A large proportion of the population are he Chinese. These people are small in stature, yellow a color, pagan in religion, ingenious, industrious ioffensive, cowardly, low-lived, filthy, and ugly as )ads--creatures to which they bear a striking family sernblance. They work at any and every thing, any of theln doing housework, washing and ironing, (1 the like. I remember seeing the following names '"Orientals" on their business signs: Wo Hop, ung Gee, Cum Lum Sam, Sam Lee, Wo Lee, Wo ilg, Ah Sin', WTving AVo, Yek Wa. These dis- -    Cj    tinguished gentlemen from the Orient, (or rather, to one in California, from the Occident) were all exten- sively engaged in the laundry business. There are but few negroes in San Francisco. I do not not think I saw a dozen while there. THE MONEY in circulation in the "Golden City" is only silver and gold. No paper money of any kind is seen. EARTHQUAKES are a luxury which this city indul- ges in occasionally. We had one gentle shock while I was there. A few years ago they were favored with one that did much damage, and scared many of the inhabitants out of a year's growth: and in October, 1868, they had one still more severe. Slight shocks are quite common. San Francisco is one of the greatest fruit, vegeta- ble, and grain markets in the world. During my sojourn in San Francisco, I was em- ployed as "Funny Man" of a well-known literary paper, the "GOLDEN CITY;" and shortly after my arrival I published an article, under a non, de plume, in which I touched up some of the peculiarities of the city as they presented themselves to me, in the follow- ing manner: "CAT'S-EYE VIEW OF SAN FRANCISCO. BY 0. JOB JONES. "One morning, shortly after my arrival in San Francisco, I strolled out to take a view of the city as it was and is-the clerk of my hotel having kindly  informed me that it was 'piled up all around us.' "I first directed my steps to the post-office, where, making my way up to the 'J' window, I modestly inquired if there was any letter for 0. Job Jones?    <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6734-00000176"/> 344    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. The clerk without looking, informed me that there wasn't. Wondering how he found it out, I asked if there were any newspapers? Yes, wrong as it was to annoy him with so many foolish questions, I did." - What was his reply? "I will tell you. "The truth of the matter was, the steamer hadn t been in more than twenty-four hours, and the papers had not yet been distributed. This the clerk might have informed me, in calm, gentlemanly and compre. hensive language: but, did he? No. Such a course would have been inconsistent with his dignity. Here's the way he answered me; he says--and that in a rude tone that startled me-says he: "' YOU'D BETTER WAIT TILL THEY'RE DISTRIBUTED FIRST, HADN'T YOU!' "Abashed and mortified at this exhibition of supe- rior greatness, and enjoying a full sense of my little- ness-my comparative nothingness-I turned away, trembling. If I had never before felt that I was but mortal, I felt it now-felt it sensibly, deeply, awfully, as I shrunk from the stern presence of this great being. "I was patient, however. I remembered that the morning was a little damp; and, wishing to return good for evil, I informed this mighty man that there 'was a more genial climate located somewhere-a climate where they have warm weather the year round-and recommended his emigration thither at once. All this in the most laconic language irlagi- nable.  ' The Atheist claims that there is no God: but he is    THE "GOLDEN CITY."      345 clearly mistaken. Just let him go to that post-office window and inquire for a paper or letter inopportune- ly, and he will see before him the stern, exalted countenance of as fine a little god as any one would wish to see. Vulcan, the god of fire; Mars, the god of war; Neptune, the god of the deep; and Jupiter, the great big god of all, are simply nowhere, com- pared with that pompous and pretentious clerk of the P. O.! "Full of these thoughts, I wended my way west- ward, towards the more elevated regions of the city. I had not gone far till I met a singular being, whose name (I have since learned) was John Hung Kee Dung Kee Lung Kee Mung Kee Choo Bang. This person, I understood, constituted a considerable por- tion of the population of San Francisco. The most remarkable feature about him was, that he didn't re- semblee anybody else I had ever seen, in any feature. His color was a mixture about half-way between that of a bay colt and that of a cream-colored pony. His nose was the puggest of the pug, and the ugliest of the ugly. He wore a blue cotton petticoat on each leg, and a black shirt, which he hadn't the decency to stuff in anywhere. HeI had a pair of skates on, but the iron part was broken off, and he walked on the wood. He had no hat on, but his head was tied up in a piece of goods such as they make black cotton umbrellas of. He had no hair on his head at all, ex- cept just one single one that grew out at the back about as thick as a corn-cob, and hung down to his heels, where it came to a point. This, I fancied, would be very convenient to hang him. He appeared    <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6734-00000177"/> 346     JOHN SMITH ON A CRUITCII. to be an adult male, not younger than fifteen, or older than forty-nine; but somewhere along about there. "I have been informed that this individual was im- ported in large numbers from a little island, some- where in the Pacific, called China. It is but a small island, inhabited by only a few hundred millions of these people; so they can never do much harm any- where. "As I walked up street, I was a little surprised to meet a house on its way down to the post-office.*  It was traveling  slowly, to be sure; but it looked smiling and happy, and even intelligent. I am  in- formed that when a man gets dissatisfied with the location of his dwelling, he just ties a rope round the door-knob and leads it away, up or down street, to soine more agreeable vicinity, like a man leading a horse to water with a halter. I have since met quite a number walking about. They seem   quite tractable and docile, and  will follow where led, just like a good-natured elephant. "I  like this system very much. I cannot help thinking how convenient it would be if I had a house up in that neighborhood where the  ' John" element prevails. I should just put a halter on and lead it away a mile or two to-morrow morning before break- -fast.  .  * This is an allusion to the moving of buildings, which is carried on to a considerable extent in San Francisco. It is no unusual thng there, to move a frame building as mnuch as a mile when the owner finds it profitable to sell the ground it stands on.   TIE, "GOLDEN CITY."      347 c' I like several things about San Francisco. I like its "fractional currency" for one thing. The material it is printed on is better calculated for standing all sorts of weather, and the wear and tear of time, than that in the States. Moreover, it is not near so likely to be repudiated, and enjoys a better foreign reputa- tion. ' I like the ladies here; they have but one fault. That fault is similar to that of the very small congre- gation that turned out one Sunday morning at the church I used to attend. There were not more than nineteen of us, and the parson scolded us for an hour because we didn't turn out better. It wasn't our fault that the rest didn't come. I'm sure I was all there. So, I suppose it is hardly just to censure the ladies here because there are not more of them; it ish't their fault. "I am also pleased with the elevated points around ;* they give a man a chance to rise in the world, with- out principle, capital or reputation. Besides, one of them would be such a fine start for a monument. One might be topped out on Telegraph Hill, for in- stance, with very little expense; and in a graphic description of it, it might be stated that the top was five hundred and twenty-three feet above tide-water. No allusion need be made to the-bottom. "Among  other peculiarities of San Francisco, I per- ceive that the blacking of boots and shoes is done by grown-up adult men, and that they have regular "I have already intimated that there were a few rough hills  in this vicinity.

This is a grand idea. The customer not only has a comfortable seat to sit in while his brogans are being rubbed down and shined up, but he also enjoys the luxury of a shelter, which is ample protection against the heavy summer rains and winter snows, which, I believe, prevail very extensively here. "Pardon me if I make any blunders in giving my views of San Francisco.* "I have perceived, in the course of my perambula- tions, that they were moving Kearny street further up the hill t I didn't like to ask any questions con- cerning it, lest I should be considered green; but I supposed that the reason was that it had slid down at the time of the earthquake here, a few years ago. I have heard so much about the rough state of society here, that I am surprised and delighted to find that law and order are as strictly observed here as in any city of the States. From what I have heard in times gone by, I was led to anticipate that I should hear a bullet whiz every time I should step from my door, and that I should find a fresh dead man lying at every corner. I am glad to find, however, that the streets are entirely clear of such obstructions, and  that men are not killed here, except in cases of abso- lute necessity. I highly approve of this orderly state of things.

M. Foard, of the "Golden City," San Francisco, and was very cordially re-  ceived. "Mr. Foard," I said one day, shortly after my ar-  rival, "I am very fond of the water--  "Not as a beverage, I hope," he interrupted. "Not as a regular beverage; but as a medium of navigation. I love riding on the water. I would like to go out and take a row." "Where?" he asked. '"On the harbor," I replied. "Don't do it." "Why??" "You are not familiar with our harbor. It is an unsafe one for an inexperienced boatman.  Even some of the most skillful lose their lives. It may be calm and smooth as a river one moment; the next, the tide may change, the wind rise against it, and it may become so boisterous, all at once, that you might imagine it was ready to boil over.

Five minutes after leaving the office of the "Goldeon City," I met two fellow-passengers, named Gilmore and Brooker-both good fellows, and fond of fun- the latter a nephew of a celebrated "ornament of the stage, then "drawing houses" in San Francisco. "Smith," said Gilmore, suppose we take a ride somewhere?" "Where?"I asked. "Any where," said he. "Let us take a boat-ride," suggested 13rooker. "The very thing!" said Gilmore. "I have been told," I interposed, " that the harbor here is rather dangerous, and- ---' "O, never mind We can manage a boat in any harbor. I am some oarsman, myself." "There can't be much danger with three of us to run the craft," remarked Brooker. Let us go  We went. The face of the harbor was as smooth and gentle as hat of a "sleeping beauty," and the three of us glided gracefully out from one of the piers-a pair of oars, in my skillful (?) hands, gently dipping into the unruf- fled waters at irregular intervals. The friendly warn- ing of Foard was entirely forgotten. O Foard! Thou best of friends!

The air is usually quiet in the morning, at San Fran- cisco, but as the day advances, a stiff breeze springs. up, and, on meeting the ebbing -tide, stirs up the waters of the harbor, as though a young son of Nep- tune were just beneath the surface, lashing them with his toy-whip: the waterman must then exercise his utmost strength and skill to navigate with safety. We had not proceeded more than a mile, when the tide commenced to run out, the wind came sweeping. in through the "Golden Gate," and the waters began to evince their illest humor. The first trifling mishap that befel us was that a rough, ill-natured, foam-crested wave came slashing along, wrested an oar from my hand, and left it float- ing on the "briny deep." The boat became un- manageable, turned with her side to the waves, and lay in a trough of the-harbor. In endeavoring to recover the truant oar, Gilmore pitched out into the "yeast of waves;" and, in en- deavoring to recover hinz, by means of his coat-tail, I pitched out; and, in endeavoring to save himself from the same fate, Brooker pitched out; and there, with "Nothing save the waves and"-us, and the boat, (half-full of water,) we commenced a manly and awkward struggle for existence. With this boon in view, Gilmore clung to the oar, and Brooker and I to the boat. By this time, the wind was blowing with actual fierceness, and the waves swept clear over our heads every second. There can be little doubt that we    <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6734-00000180"/> 352    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. would all have found an eternal nest among the slimy harbor-weed, with'only the monsters of the shallow to drop a (crocodile) tear upon our "moist, uncomforta- ble bodies," but for certain timely " succor " that ap- peared on the scene at this critical juncture., The said "succor" comprised two skillful oarsmen, who owned the boat, and, having seen that we managed it poorly, and fearing the loss of their property, had put out to our assistance some minutes prior to the start- ling accident-arriving just in time to save their boat (and us) from an aqueous tomb. They hauled us and the lost oar aboard their own boat, like so many packages of damaged goods, (flotsam Blackstone would have styled us,) took the other boat in tow, and started for shore,-giving us a good round cursing for our awkwardness in so nearly sacrificing their property. I never told Foard of this adventure till about two months had elapsed, and it had got a little "old." Then, having first exacted a promise from him that he would not scold me for what I was about to tell him, frankly confessed the whole affair, bringing out all the little extenuating points, such as, "The morn- ing was so fine," "The harbor was so smooth,"' "We thought that three of us could surely manage one boat," "We had partaken of fluid refreshments," "We hadn't seen each other for several days, and felt so jolly glad," et cetera.

EAR reader, before bidding adieu to San Fran- Cisco, let your one-le-gged friend introduce vou to a noble citizen of that cosmopolitan cit Whom, for the sake of a name, shall be styled Dr. Charles Rowell of Kearny street. Let us call this chapter an imaginary sketch of what might be, what has been, and what will be. Let us suppose your friend John Smith on a crutch to be only mortal: let us suppose him, after all, an ordinary object for-- "The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," as well as subject to- "'I'l-he heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to :" let us suppose him a human being who eats, drinks- yes, Cr Tiks/--sleeps, and indulges in other like amuse nmets, and let us suppose him susceptible of suffrino when the means of these enjoyments are, by any chance, temporarily withheld. Let us even suppose that he may be "broke," sick, and "in a   strange land, all at once. Let us suppose that the "Panama Fever, which is "no respecter of persons '" may lay hold of him on any proper occasion, and let us sup-   THE DOCTOR.        355 pose that poverty which is another " no-respecter-of- persons," may happen to pay him a friendly visit about the same time. Let us suppose both visitors going hand in hand and calling on John Smith at the same time at his lodging-house in San Francisco. In asking the reader to assume all this, I do not positively assert that such things did actually happen to John Smith himself, in this connection, but I can testify to the substantial truth of what I am about to relate, and it is no harm to make use of Mr. Smith as an actor. I have heard a good deal said about angels: but as no one now living can prove to the satisfaction of the public that he ever saw one, the personal appear- ance and general traits of their characters can be but matters of conjecture. We are inclined, however, when speaking or think- ing of an angel, to fancy it a lovely creature-whether male or female, I cannot say--of fair complexion, blue eyes and light curling hair, and clothed in a long white robe, with the hue of the " driven snow "--the handsome toes just peeping out from beneath the lower folds. In addition to this,-we fancy a pair of gentle wings protruding from the shoulder blades. These, however useful, when the angel happens to be in a hurry, are rather calculated to detract from the handsome outline of a fine figure, in case the fashiona- ble clothing of the present day should be used, instead of the robe. I believe that every reader will readily comprehend me, without my going to the trouble to say that the wings alluded to, if covered with a neat dress coat, (or other fashionable garment,) would give    <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6734-00000182"/> -- J. .Lb LU J L.,fl the wearer a lamentable appearance of being hump- backed. Such, however, are not my ideas of an angel. As we cannot know, positively, what shape we are to assume after leaving the scenes of our present exist- ence, I have selected my beau ideal of an angel from among the sons of men. The angel I shall describe has a handsome, manly, noble, genial, smiling face; the calm gray eyes twinkle with merriment and good nature; a heavy black beard flows from the lower half of the countenance; the brow is one of the intelligent order, the hair is dark; the figure is full and strong, and  dressed--not in a  flowing white robe-but in black pantaloons, vest and frock-coat, actually made by a corporeal tailor. For the latter article of clothing, while the owner lounges easily in his neat office, dur- ing hours of leisure, might be substituted a dressing. gown. At such times, too, place a common brier- wood pipe in the  hand, and the figure of my angel is complete. Such was Doctor Rowell, whose image, but poorly portrayed here, may well supersede the bright one of the winged angel in the fancy of John Smith. John Smith being in San Francisco; without em-  ployment; attacked with a return of Panama Fever contracted on the Isthmus; suffering a natural depres. sion of spirits; withal, in "r'educed circumstances  , and being of too delicate a nature to apply to friends, --although he had some there who would have rushed to his assistance with a relish--came to the melancholy conclusion that the best thing he could    THE DOCTOR.         357 do, sad as it was, was to enter the City Hospital for- say--an indefinite period. With this view, he, languid, pale and emaciated, walked into the office of a physician-walked into the same office on a crutch-to ask for information as to the measures to be resorted to in order to gain ad- mittance to the City Hospital.  This physician chanced to be the man whom we style Dr. Charlie Rowell. This was the angel, who, unlike the popular angel with robe and wings, wore a common black suit, a smile, a merry twinkle of the eye, and carried a pipe in his hand, at which he took occasional deliberate whiffs. "Sit down," he said to the one-legged young man. The latter seated himself on a sofa. "You are the Doctor?" "That's what they call me," answered the physi- cian, cheerfully. Then he took a calm whiff of that pipe, and deliberately sat down in a rocking-chair. Smith would have remarked that the weather was fine, but he remembered that the weather is always pleasant in San Francisco. So, he switched off on an other subject--the subject-and said: "Doctor, I have simply come in to ask for a little information. I am a stranger here, and I suppose you can tell me what I desire to know." "What is that?" "I wish information as to the means of gaining ad- mittance to the City Hospital." "Why do you want to go to the hospital?" "Because, I am quite unwell, have no immediate business prospects, and am nearly broke."    <pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6734-00000183"/> 358    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. "What seems to be the matter with you?" "Something like ague." "Have you come through Panama lately?"' "Yes, I only landed here a week or two ago. I have not felt quite well since my arrival, and since I fell out of a boat in the harbor the other day and got wet, I have felt worse." After some discussing of symptoms, the Doctor sa'id: "You have what is called Panama Fever. But that's nothing. Where did you lose your leg?" "In the army." "Well, it is not necessary for you to go to the hos- pital. It would be a hard place for you to go to, any how, and I cannot allow it. Do not be discouraged. It is nothing here for new-comers to find themselves pecuniarily reduced. Such things happen every day. A great many persons are arriving here now, and many of them come with but little spare means. As numbers do not get into business so soon as they hope, the result is very natural. Now, as for your- self, if you suppose that I, who can easily cure you in a short time, would sit here with my arms folded, smoking my pipe, and see you go into the hospital for want of treatment, and that, too, after you have lost a limb in the service of your country, I must say that it speaks poorly for your discernment of human character. I  should " "But I  am almost without means, and ---" "Well, suppose you are?  I  am not. You shall not, go into the hospital; you shall accept medicine from me; you shall also allow me to see that you   THE DOCTOR.        359 want for nothing in the way of living till you are well and succeed in getting into business." "But, Doctor, it would not be right for me to"-- "Excuse me one moment," interrupted the Doctor, rising and going into another room. When, after a brief absence, he returned, it was with several small packages of medicines in his hand with " directions" pasted on them. "' Take these with you to your lodging-house, and come in and see me to-morrow." "But how can I, consistently  " "Come, now, after I have prepared the medicines for your particular case, you would not surely refuse them, and thus render them useless." "Very well, Doctor, I will take them; but re- member  that I do not accept them  gratuitously. That, however, does not lessen your kindness in offering them. I will accept treatment at present, but it must be with the understanding that I am to pay you as soon as I -- "Have more money than I have," interrupted the Doctor. On arriving at his lodging-hous e, and entering his room, the owner of the packages began to examine them. One was a small vial with a brandy-colored liquid in it, and a label on instructing the patient to indulge in a certain number of drops at certain in- tervals. Another was a small, round paper box, which rattled in such a way as to entirely preclude the idea of its containing any thing else than pills. A label on this box suggested to the afflicted the    <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6734-00000184"/> 3 60    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. expedience of enveloping one of them in his stomach each evening about bed-time. A third box, however, was a puzzle. It was like the second in size, was heavier, did not rattle, and bore the following astounding directions: t USE ACCORDING TO JUDGMENT." What could this mean?  How should the patient know what rules to observe in the use of this box of "medicine," limited as was his knowledge of the art of Esculapius?  Still, it would do no harm to open the box and see what manner of medicine it con- tained. This proceeding being carried out, developed the fact that it contained several hard, shiny, yellowish, metallic, button-shaped "pills," wrapped in paper, each containing the following strange inscription: ACIREMA FO SETATS DETINU.  LOD EVIF." s .    A STARTLING BUNDLE.      361 CHAPTER    XLIX. A STARTLING BUNDLE. EARLY one Monday morning in August, after a sojourn of about three months in San Francisco, in the course of which I had been, on the whole, rather prosperous than otherwise, I was sitting in the office of the "Golden City," when I suddenly, with- out knowing why, conceived the idea of returning to "the States." The steamer Nevada, of the "Oppo- sition Line," was to leave for Panama on the ensuing Wednesday; and I walked down to the office of the company and bought a ticket-being just in time to secure the last stateroom. The astonishment and sadness of my numerous friends--for by this time there were two full semi- circles of them in San Francisco--on learning. of this rash act, were a source of mingled amusement and pain to me. I half regretted what I had done, and if I had not already purchased my ticket, I should have relinquished the idea of going. But the die was cast, and, concealing from them the regret I felt, I lightly reminded them that they too well knew that "When I took a notion to go to any place," I was moderately certain to go. Not till the steamer floated away from the pier,    <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6734-00000185"/> o ualit SMITH ON A CRUTCH. amid the cheers and blessings of several thousand spectators, and I saw the waving hands, hats, and handkerchiefs, and heard the friendly farewells of a score who had conme to see me off, and of hundreds who had come to bid other passengers adieu, did I fully realize that I was leaving the city I had so soon learned to love--again starting on a long journey of more than five thousand geographic miles. When I did realize it, it was with a depth of sadness I cannot describe: and had Inot been a man, I think I should hardly have subdued that moisture of the eyes that is looked upon as an evidence of weakness-though it is sometimes a noble and heavenly weakness ! The voyage to Panalna, in the course of which we put in at Manzanillo, Mexico, for coal, occupied four- teen days. Much space might be absorbed with a full description of it; but it would be scarcely perti- nent. Let us close our eyes on the voyage, imagine a lapse of two weeks, and we find the good steamer Nevada quietly anchored     at early morn  in  the picturesque harbor of Panama, New Granada. There are no  piers for the accommodation of large vessels at Panama, so that ocean steamers  must anchor three miles from shore, in the de ep water, and be relieved of their cargoes and passen gers, or loaded  therewith, by means of lighters and small stearnboats. We rose from our berths on the morning the Nevaeda anchored in the harbor of Panama, elated with the prospect of crossing the Isthmus and taking another steamer at Aspinwall for New York.  It was, there- fore, somewhat to our c    hagrin that we learned that an accidecnt had happened the connecting  steamer,     A STARTLING BUNDLE; -66 )akzotah, that although due at Aspinwall five or six days previously, she had barely arrived, and that we must tie at Panama and wait till she should have discharged her cargo. The prospective delay was variously estimated by the officers at from "a few days," to " some little time." The natives learned that we were to lie in the harbor for some days, and soon flocked about the steamer in small boats, offering to convey to shore all who wished to visit the rusty old city. The price they asked was cuarto rialos per head-which means half-awdollar. Many of us took advantage of this means of escap- ing from the confinement of the vessel, and in an hour or two the greater portion of -the steamer Neva- da's " population " might have been seen intermingled with the inhabitants of benighted Panama. Promi- nent among those who visited the city might have been seen the owner of a certain crutch. It was now the "rainy season," but the heat, be- tween the showers that visited us daily, was intense and oppressive. To counteract its effects, the thirsty Caucasians resorted to certain iced drinks, containing stimulants, which were to be had at the saloons at twenty-five cents (coin) each. I regret to chronicle the fact that many of them used these beverages to an extent rather calculated to engender thirst (next morning) than to allay it. As the shades of evening began to fall over the tropics, three persons, Monsieur Figaro, a Frenchman; Mr. Hawes, an Englishman; and I, John Smith, Esq., an Americo-Caucasian, wended their way down 'a     <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6734-00000186"/> 364    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. street of Panama, with the intention of taking a small boat at the beach, and returning to the steamer- Nevada. Now, at the lower end of this street, near the arch- way in the city's wall, affording an outlet to the beach, there is a certain saloon with the alluring name of "OREGONIAN SHADES." The proprietor is an intelligent native, about the color of new leather who speaks both Spanish and English. When we had come over to Panama, that morning, there was in " our crowd" a humorous and witty pas- senger named Briggs; but, in the course of the day, we had lost sight of him, and I just glanced in at the "Oregonian Shades," as we passed, deeming it possi- ble that he might be there; and hoping for the pleasure of his company, together with that of my French and English friends, to the steamer. Mr. Briggs was not there; but there was within a lady passenger of the Nevada, who was one of the most remarkable persons I ever met. This lady, whose husband was also a passenger, was about twenty- eight years old, five feet four inches high, and weighed two hundred and ten pounds. Her width may be imagined. To add that she was inclined to embonpoont, would be rather mild language. She was obviously of Irish birth and parentage: but whatever I may have occasion to say, of her personal merits or demerits, must not be construed into any invidious insinuations against her nationality, for I am not pre, judiced against the Irish, but rather in their favor, claiming that, everything fairly considered, they pos- sess as many noble traits as any other people.   A STARTLING BUNDLE.      365 This corpulent lady was not, I regret to say,' in a rational mood. She had visited Panama early in the day, in the company of her husband-a big,. ill-look- ing, muscular American--who had become intoxica- ted during  the day and basely deserted her. His name was  hilip--soebody--and he was termed "Pheel" by the lady iM question, whose accent was peculiar. When I have stated that Mrs. "Pheel," however temjerat, was not of the total abstinence howstripe," ut rather given to the moderate use of aqueous stimulus, and that she had not departed a hair's breadth from her princples on the ay in ques- tion, I think that the intelligent reader will not fail to comprehend the true state of things. "Welcome,' said I, addressing the proprietor of the Oregonan Shades, as I looked in, "have you seen the gentleman with side-whiskers who was in here with us to-day, and whom we called Briggs?" "Not since two o'clock," replied Ilombre. At this moment Mrs. "Pheel" started up from her seat like one excited. "Have ye seen Pheel?" she eagerly asked. "I have not, madam," I replied. "Och, he's lift me!" she exclaimed, throwing her- self back into her seat, and dropping two of five bundles of goods she had been buying. This was too much for me. My sympathies were aroused in a moment. I knew by Phiip's complex- ion that he was a drinking man, and here was the patient and' gentle wife anxiously awaiting his return to the "Oregonian Shades." Can it be wonderedat that, meantime, hot weather, corpulence, anxiety, and    <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6734-00000187"/> 366    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. general depression of spirits all taken into considera- tion, she had not sat there all that time dying of thirst, while the means of allaying it were before her? Not rationally. The proprietor afterward in- formed me that she had "drank nothing but ale:" how much, he could not undertake to compute. "Probably," said I, to the deserted woman, as I stepped in and gently picked up her bundles for her, "Philip has taken a little too much, and forgot- ten you. You had better return to the steamer." A "Is he in there?" asked my English companion at the door. "Who?-Briggs?" "Yes." "No, he is not: but here is a lady whom you have seen on the steamer, and who has lost sight of her husband. Had she not better return with us?" "I suppose so." '"Well, madam," said I, "we are going back to the steamer now; will you come with us? Phil will be all right. No doubt he is there by this time." "Och, Mr. Smith, ye won't desart me, will ye!" she exclaimed, letting two more bundles fall. Mr. Smith! she actually called me by name! That she knew my name I was not aware. How she had learned it was a mystery to me; but it was more tmarvelous still that, having learned so strange and rare a name, she remembered it! "No, madam," said I, "you shall go with us to the ship. Come." And I gallantly picked up her two bundles and restored them to her fulsome arms. By this time Monsieur Figaro was looking over   A STARTLING BUNDLE.      367 Mr. IIawes's shoulder at the door, and I fancied I saw him smile. It may have been imagination. "Come, madam," said I,. "we are going down to hire a boat immediately. Will you go with us?" ' Och! Indade I wull!" She now rose-being very 'little taller standing than when sitting-dropping all her bundles but one. I picked up all but one. "Come, let us go." It was now fully dark. Somewhat to my chagrin, this charming and confi- ding creature grasped my gallant arm, as a support; and we all started for the beach. With the care of two hundred and ten unsteady pounds on my arm, and I walking on a frail crutch, I confess that I experienced a difficulty in traveling to the beach which I did not acknowledge at the time. On the way to the boat, my voluptuous companion dropped all her bundles, one by one, and they were promptly picked up, taken care of, and carried after us, by a little native with nothing but a hat on- whose attention and fidelity I generously rewarded with a silver half-dollar, on arriving at the water's edge. I will not take it upon myself to say that Mrs. "Pheel" had drank too much, as I should not wish to do her the slightest injustice: it may have been the extreme heat of the climate; it may have been her obesity; it may have been her anxiety; it may have been that she was not blessed with a strong con- stitution; it may have been all or part of these com- bined that governed her conduct: but certain it is,    <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6734-00000188"/> 368    JOHN SMITH ON A CRUTCH. that Mrs. "Pheel," acted strangely and unlike a lady at the beach. Some little delay was occasioned there, by the fact that the native who engaged to take us to the steamer, had to go and hunt up his partner; and during the interval, Mrs. "Pheel" not only talked- strangely, walked strangely, and bore herself in an unaccountable manner; but actually became unreason- able, unmanageable, and even pugnacious. She first opened our eyes by declaring that we were going to rob her, and adding: "Bedad, I'll make Pheel put a head on yez all!" This was somewhat startling to me, as I had one head that suited me very well, and, with my means of perambulating, did not desire to be encumbered with another. "Madam," I remonstrated, "I pray that you will be quiet. We are your friends, and you are welcome to go with us to the steamer. I hope " "Where's my fan?" she interrupted, springing with some abruptness to a new theme of conversa- tion. "I do not know.  Have you lost one?" "Bedad some one's sthole it," she vociferated. By this time a dozen natives had collected on the beach, and were viewing the female Caucasian with mingled wonder and amusement. Mr. Hawes was sitting on an old spar at this time, calmly fanning himself with a palm-leaf fan he had carried all day. The  object, at this unfortunate moment, caught the eye of Mrs. Pheel. "Ye  blaggard ye!" she fairly screamed, staggering   A STARTLING BUNDLE.      369 clumlsily toward the startled Englishman; " ye hov me fant Bad luck to ye, ye divil! Give me that!" Without waiting for a word of remonstrance from Mr. Hawes, she dealt him a blow on the cheek bone that sent him backward over the spar, with his feet elevated in the night air; and, at the same time, stag- gered, herself, whirled round and fell prostrate on the rough stones and sand of the beach. She was actually crazy. She screamed, struggled convulsively, swore a few regular brimstone oaths, then lay a little while apparently insensible, and gasping as though she were in a retort- and the air had suddenly been pumped away. By this time, quite a concourse of curious natives had collected around us. After an apparent death-struggle of three-quarters of a minute, she actually ceased to breathe, and I feared she was dead. I took her ample wrist in my hand and there was not the slightest perceptible pulsa- tion. Itere was a go! Here was a fix for John Smith! Night; foreign country; a dead woman on the beach; only two of my race present, and they seared like the deuce; surrounded by a score or two of the swarthy, blood-thirsty natives of a semi-bar- barous land [ O, how I wished that crutch of mine were but cliclking on the side-walk in front of Trinity ehurch, New York; or the State House, Phlliladelphia. But no, there I was; and the gloom of night, mingled with the black faces of vicious and cowardly ruf- fians, frowned on me. O, Smith! Smith! What was to be done? What could be done? Fortunately, the boat was soon after ready, and t 24, l.    <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6734-00000189"/>  s s -U'U 1 'Ui; , thought the best thing we could do would be to have the "body " put aboard, and take it along. My com-n. panions concurred. But how should we get it into the boat? The quickest way was to hire the natives; so, I spoke to them. In my extremity, I remembered that but a small proportion of those present could speak English, so I endeavored to address them with a mixture of both English and Spanish. As nearly as I can recollect, I thus spoke to any and all of them, individually and collectively: "Hombre!  Signor! Carryo this hero faltwonano into boato for cuearlo rtilos / Do you mind!" It appears they comprehended me, for eight of them, in view of half-a dollar each, laid hold of the "form" and proceeded to carry it into the boat. It was in- deed a clumsy burden. Yet they conveyed it to the boat on scientific principles. The following was the pr ogralmme: any anatomist will readily comprehen d. Two of the fombres supported their share of the weight by locking hands beneath the gcltews maximi; two others, in like manner, supported the clavicles, coacoacozl process tand acromion of scapula, the humeri, l&amp;cc, rad'ius, et cetera, besides the sternunm and la1tissim?1s dorSi; two others supported the tibia, fibula, gastrocne- at?."s, tib/aljs aaticus and extensor comnmtnis digitorum;  the seventh supported the base of tibz'a, astrabls, peroneels ertins, abcluctor mini dcligiti, and extensor polliclis proprzius; while the eighth tookl charge of the occ'iNto-froaltalz's tempnoralis, os fronlis, parieltal and orbi. catlais j/8 ctiictCrar?rn. Thus they conveyed the inanimate form   to the small boat; but they were just on +'c poinlt of 'dump. -r    ing" it in, when it returned to consciousness, opened its eyes and mouth, breathed, and was once more Mrs. "Pheel." "Murther!" was the first articulate sound of the resuscitated. 'Hush, my good woman," I implored. "You are all right now. We are starting for the steamer." Thereupon, she opened her mouth and uttered a series of screams that made the eight hateful, and causes me to shudder yet, when I think of them. The substance of them was: Murther!  Murther   Murther! Robberyl Robbery!  Help! Police! Watch!  Watch I Police I Murther! Murther I Watch I  Help  Help!  Help!  Murther! Murther! Murther I Police  Police! Police! Och! ye bloody divils  Murther! Murther! Murther!" This, however, is but an abridged edition of the original. For five minutes-every one seeming like an age--she continued to scream in this manner, making the old walls of Panama to resound as with the voices of all the fiends. Had this happened at the piers, of any civilized town or city, the gens-d'armes would soon have been down upon us and arrested the whole party; but as it was, we were not molested, and much to our relief, at last succeeded in getting clear of shore, and we glided away toward the steamer in the dim darkness, with our baleful charge.

I need not tell of our arrival at the steamer; of the trouble the sailors had getting the drunken wonall up the gang-ladder; of our meeting Briggs there; of his suggesting, while they were tugging away at the again insensible creature, pulling her up step by step, to " send for the baggage- ^aster," as the proper person to take charge of the immense bundle; of our lying in the harbor five days; of my meeting drunken "Pheel" in Panama, the day after our adventure with his charming bigger half; of his threatening to "punch a hole through" me with a sword-cane, for "running away with" his gentle wife the proprietor of the Oregonian States having told him, on inquiry, that 'she went away with that one-legged fellow ;"-of our final crossing the Isthmus;. of our embarking at last on the crippled Dakotah; of our tedious vogage of fourteen days, from Aspinwall to New York; of the various e/vents on the passage; of the death and burial at sea of a bright little boy, who had eaten too much tropical f uit; of our suffering for cold water--there being no ice on board the m1iseralle slip; of our poor food and but little of it-being restricted to two meals a day; of the   EXIT SMAITI.       373 machinery giving out off the coast of Cuba, and our danger of not being able to reach any port; of our -being towed by a bark, to whom we showed a signal of distress; of a fire on board, which was happily ex- tingulished; of a hard blow off Cape Hatteras; of our final arrival in New York: et cetera, and all that. It is proper, in this chapter,.to make some disposi. tion of myself, as writers usually do of their principal characters in the concluding chapter. Therefore, pre- pare to bid John Smith an everlasting farewell. To wind up by stating that I got married to a beau- tiful heiress, after the usual stern opposition, but final consent of her stony-hearted old " parient," and that I settled down after my rambles, and lived to a green old age, would be a very happy termination; but the events narrated are of too recent occurence, and would appear like anachronisms. So, I must abandon that idea. Still, I must make some disposition of myself, for if the reader is allowed to suppose me still perambu- lating over the world with the inevitable CRUTCH, he will feel that he has not yet read- the conclusion of my story, and will look forward to the publication of a supplementary volume of adventures, similar to these-look forward, I heartily assure him, only to be bitterly disappointed. Linger over this volume, gentle reader, for when you have -laid it down you will hear of John Snith, the man of the CRUTCH, no more. Hie is a dead letter. But now for that disposition. This remarkable character must be got rid of some how. But how? I ca-n think of no end for hin so fitting as death.    <pb n="374-375 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6734-00000191"/> o rIiaLij U N A CRUTCH. So, dear reader, as I have abandoned the idea of concluding with an account of my marriage; as death is a circumstance of almost as much importance in one s history; and as I am supported in this course by eminent precedent-Moses having given a graphic account of his own death in Deuteronomy; and as moreover, this may be read years hence, when the hand that is writ;ng it has indeed grown cold, and the pen fallen from its weary grasp, (and when there will be a vacant crutch to let,) I will conclude by simply stating that I died. ,   "ST OF NEW PUBLICATIONS.
