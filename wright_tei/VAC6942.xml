               <head>THE REBEL BRIDE:</head> 
               <head type="sub">A STORY OF THE REVOLUTION.</head> 
               <p>IT was a charming evening in the fall of 177- that the Widow Stanley and her daughter Isabel were seated in the verandah of their fine old mansion in--country, North Caroline. The mellow hues of autumn gave a sober, but not a sad appearance to the scenery around them; no frost had yet come to nip the verdure of the trees, but the ripe fruits which cumbered the orchard, and the deepening tints that variegated the foliage, bespoke the season.</p> 
               <p>The scene was one of seemingly quiet happiness. In front of them was an extensive lawn, interspersed with walks and groves, through which a meandering road led to the great gateway. Several deer were lying under the trees undisturbed in their repose, and upon the bosom of an artificial lake floated a snow-white swan, motionless as sculptured marble. At the moment our story opens, the two occupants of the Verandah, who had for some minutes been wrapped in contemplative silence, were interrupted by a group of half-naked, but well-fed, happy-looking negro children, who stole timidly around the house and approached, them, as if doubting their reception, yet urged on by some errand which they thought would excuse their intrusion.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Jim," said the elder lady, as soon as she perceived them, "what brings you in front of the house?"</p> 
               <p>"If you please, missis, Uncle Tom's cum from de mill, and he see whole heap ob red coats!"</p> 
               <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6942-00000004"/> 
               <p>"Red coats!" exclaimed both ladies at once. "Where is Tom-why does he not come himself?"</p> 
               <p>"Say, please mam, he stop wash de blood from he farce."</p> 
               <p>"Blood!" exclaimed Isabel, rising from her seat-"is Tom wounded?"</p> 
               <p>"Where is he?" demanded the widow, rising.</p> 
               <p>"Here him cum now," said the boy, stepping back to make way for the messenger of the unwelcome tidings he had announced.</p> 
               <p>With a bandana handkerchief tied around his head, and his clothes showing stains of blood, Tom appeared. He was a fine, athletic negro, of an unusually open and good-natured countenance, a faithful servant of the Stanleys'; but now his eye shone with unwonted fire, and a stern determination marked his countenance.</p> 
               <p>"Why, what is this, Tom? Jim says you have seen the British, and are wounded," said his mistress.</p> 
               <p>"Why, yes marm; as I passed de cross-road, dis side ob de Green farm; I see five, six-a dozen red coats gwine towards dat debblish tory Johnson's house."</p> 
               <p>"And they overtook and wounded you-how did you escape?" inquired Isabel.</p> 
               <p>"No, miss, I doesn't think dey see me anyhow."</p> 
               <p>"How did you get hurt, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, you see, I know'd dey was after mischief, and so soon as de locust grove betwixt me and dem, I put de old mare up pretty brisk to come tell you fust. Well, I hadn't gone more an a hundred yards before who should I see right in de path but old Satan himself--"</p> 
               <p>"Who, Tom?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, dat 'fernal tory, Johnson."</p> 
               <p>"Stop, you brack scoundrel' said he.</p> 
               <p>"'Scuse me, Massa Johnson,' said I, 'but I'm in hurry to git home wid de meal.' Wid dat he up wid his sword and cut me right cross de head."</p> 
                
               <p>"Cut you down with his sword?"</p> 
               <p>"Not <emph>down,</emph> missus, not 'zactly <emph>down</emph>-nigger head mighty hard, an' I had on check cap."</p> 
               <p>"What then?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, guess I gib him good as he sent. I fotched him a back-handed lick wid my hickory stick-you know dere is no law for back lick, Miss Bel-and down come his house-de last ting I see, his horse was a galloping down de road, and I guess he lie dere still-teach him cut 'spectable folks' nigger, de d--n tory!"</p> 
               <p>"Mother, this is serious; they will scarcely fail to visit us, and Tom's adventure with that wretch Johnson may be the occasion of some violence."</p> 
               <p>"Nebber fear, Miss Bel," said the faithful negro, whose blood was up; "dere is ten, fifteen good smart boys of us; only say thirty, and we'll take de scythes and pitchforks and lick'em all."</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Tom, your resistance could do us no good. If the soldiers should come, you keep out of the way. Go to Amy, and let her dress your would for you-and send Moses to me."</p> 
               <p>"Stop, dear mother," said Isabel; "I will look at Tom's head myself-it must be a serious cut, and you know I have some skill."</p> 
               <p>Without waiting for a reply, the noble-hearted girl made Tom sit on the steps of the verandah, while she sent for bandages and liniment, and bound his wound with her own fair hands.</p> 
               <p>"God bless you, Miss Bel, you <emph>is</emph> a lady anyhow, and Tom die for you; only wish Massa Edward was at home, we'd have a brush wid de Britishers anyhow."</p> 
               <p>"There, go along, Tom, and never mind fighting the British."</p> 
               <p>"Yah! yonder dey comes, Missis," said Tom, as he rose from his seat, pointing with his hand to the public road, which<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6942-00000005"/> might be seen through an opening in the grove, at some two hundred yard's distance. There appeared, a full scope of British troopers, who were trotting briskly towards the gate of the park.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mother! they are coming here, I am sure," exclaimed Isabel. "What <emph>shall</emph> we do? Would Edward were at home!"</p> 
               <p>"Thank heaven he is not, child; unless with true American hearts enough around to make you haughty minions bite the dust. Yet God forgive me for invoking bloodshed. Alas! there is enough of it abroad; and it may reach our heart sooner than we desire," said the lady sadly.</p> 
               <p>"Come, Isabel," continued Mrs. Stanley, "let us retire to the parlor. I hear the gate open, and these troopers will be hear in a few moments. Moses," said she to an old gray-headed negro who had just made his appearance in obedience to her summons, "remain and see what the king's soldiers want. Treat them politely, and if their officer wishes to see me, show him into the parlor."</p> 
               <p>The ladies retired not a moment too soon. The clattering of sabres, and the tramp of their steeds as they dashed up the lawn, and halted in front of the door, was no pleasant music to their ears. The aged servitor, with no very cordial feeling toward the intruders, stood in a respectful attitude awaiting their approach.</p> 
               <p>"Cornet Howard," said the commander of the troop, a burly, red-faced captain, with not the most pleasing countenance in the world; "dismount, and tell the mistress of that mansion that Captain Desborough, of his Majesty's--Dragoons, is here with a small troop in search of forage, and that he demands quarters and food for himself and men until the morning, and such assistance, as a loyal subject, she is bound to render. You may sweeten the message to suit your own taste; but let her know that our demands must be complied with."</p> 
                
               <p>The young officer thus addressed, instantly dismounted, and giving his horse to an orderly, approached the house. He was a youth of manly form and soldierly deportment, with a countenance open, frank, and handsome.</p> 
               <p>"This is the mansion of the widow Stanley, I believe," said he, addressing Moses.</p> 
               <p>With the instinct of his race, the old negro recognized the young officer as a gentleman, and replied with more deference than he intended:-</p> 
               <p>"Yes, massa, it am; won't you walk in?"</p> 
               <p>"Give my respects to your mistress-Cornet Howard's of his Majesty's--Dragoons-and say he requests an interview."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied Moses, retiring, while the ensign mounted the steps of the verandah. The servant returned in a moment, saying Mrs. Stanley desired Ensign Howard to walk into the parlor.</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid, madam," said the officer, bowing with the grace and respectful demeanor of a perfect gentleman to the ladies; "that our visit may not be very acceptable to you, but the roughness of the times must excuse the want of ceremony, I beg, however, that you will suffer no alarm; his majesty's officers know the respect due to your sex and station."</p> 
               <p>"Pray, be seated, sir, I am not over timid; and will take the sentiment you have expressed, as a guaranty for your own conduct-though some of my unfortunate countrymen have not found safety under such a trust."</p> 
               <p>"Please excuse my haste," answered Howard, "I am not the commander of the troop present; but am deputized by Capt. Desborough; who is, to say that he is in search of forage, and Designing to halt in this neighborhood for the night, he requests food and shelter, and such assistance as a loyal subject, you are bound to render."</p> 
               <p>"I am not a loyal subject in the sense you understand the term, sir; nevertheless, Capt. Desborough may take quietly<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6942-00000006"/> what he has the power to command. The servant will show you quarters for your men, and see that all they require is provided-what my plantation affords in the way of forage is, of course, necessarily at your disposal; and I can only trust to your sense of honor and justice towards an unprotected widow. In the meantime Capt. Desborough, and yourself are invited to join our family circle." This was said with a calmness and dignity that did not fail of its impression upon the young cornet, who glanced admiringly at the lovely Isabel, as he bowed himself out and hastened to report to his superior officer; generously suppressing, however, any remark which he thought might prejudice the lady of the mansion-he merely stated that she had tendered the hospitalities of her house, and the resources of her plantation.</p> 
               <p>"It is well she is complaisant; for I should not have stood much on ceremony. She's a d-d Whig, for all her smooth hypocrisy, and may think herself well off if we don't strip the place out and out."</p> 
               <p>With this unamiable remark, which will at once afford a due to the character of Capt. Desborough, that worthy representative of his Majesty, George the Third, after making a proper disposition of his troop for the night, and giving his orders, took his ensign-to whose social position, and high aristocratic connexions he paid a sort of servile deference, as great as his rough, ungentle disposition would permit to any one-by the arm, and said:-</p> 
               <p>"Come, Howard, now we'll pay our respects to the ladies. You said nothing about the fair daughter, you sly dog; perhaps you didn't see her; however, they say she's beautiful as Venus, and the widow one of the richest proprietors in the Carolinas. That's nothing to you, however, who expect one day to be an earl; but, when we have whipped these cursed rebels, it wouldn't be a bad thing for a poor captain of dragoons, eh! my boy?"</p> 
               <p>The cornet, who was compelled to accept to a certain degree the familiarity of his commander for the sake of his own comfort, replied in sort:-</p> 
               <p>"Don't take refuge under my earldom; there's a proviso to that expectancy, that my uncle has no son, and stranger things have happened than that he should have one. So here goes for the fair rebel! We will see who shall soonest bring her to terms."</p> 
               <p>Thus jesting they reached the door, where a servant was ready to usher them in. Mrs. Stanley received the British officers-her daughter was not present-and after tendering the hospitalities of the house, and saying that supper would be announced, ordered a servant to show them to their rooms in case they desired to make their toilet after their march.</p> 
               <p>Isabel appeared at the supper table, and was formally introduced by her mother. To the awkward gallantries of Capt. Desborough, she replied in monosyllables, though Howard's politeness drew once or twice a more lengthy response.</p> 
               <p>"They tell me, madam, that you have a son in the rebel service," said the Captain, turning his attention to the mother; "which I must say is a shame and a scandal for a wealthy and honorable family, whose position should make them loyal to their king."</p> 
               <p>The widow, whose quick perception at once penetrated the character of her guest, was naturally anxious to avoid the discussion political topics. Coloring, nevertheless, at the grossness of his speech, she replied:-</p> 
               <p>"My son is of age, sir, and capable of judging for himself."</p> 
               <p>"Yes! but, madam, it is said that you are Whiggish inclined yourself, and I have fears that the disease may extend to this pretty young lady, who deserves a brave and loyal husband," said Desborough, as he turned his admiring eyes towards Isabel.</p> 
               <p>"If you mean, sir, that I am devoted to the cause of my oppressed country," said the lady, not noticing the latter part of his speech, "the supposition is correct. But I trust you<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6942-00000007"/> will excuse me, as I do not feel capable of discussing these questions."</p> 
               <p>The captain, silenced in spite of himself, by the calm dignity of his hostess, turned his attention more closely to the repast before him, which had all the substantials of a good dinner, flanked with a liberal supply of wines, &amp; c. Filling his glass, he said:-</p> 
               <p>"Well, madam, since we cannot discuss the question, allow me to offer a toast. Here's to the king! God bless him!"</p> 
               <p>"I may not refuse your toast at my own table," said the lady; "but I will take the <emph>liberty</emph> of adding to it." She raised her glass, and meeting the expectant gaze of the somewhat disconcerted royalist with a firm, dignified glance, said:-</p> 
               <p>"Here's to the <emph>king,</emph> God bless him! <emph>and may he soon be relieved from the necessity of carrying on an unjust and oppressive war!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"The glass of the British officer was at his lips, its contents just entering his greedy throat, when sputtering them forth, his red face growing scarlet with rage, he exclaimed:-</p> 
               <p>"By G-d, madam! such an insult-"</p> 
               <p>"Gently, Captain Desborough," interposed young Howard; "you are addressing a lady."</p> 
               <p>"Who taught you to mutiny against your commander; sir?" said he, turning his rage against his subordinate.</p> 
               <p>"Come, my daughter, it is time for us to <unclear>retire,</unclear>" said Mrs. Stanley, with unperturbed calmness. Gentlemen, you will find all you need. Please command my house and servants."</p> 
               <p>And with the air of a free-born woman, she led her daughter forth from the room.</p> 
               <p>"You are in a fair way to win your mistress, worthy Captain," said Howard, in a tone of raillery well calculated to increase the ire of his superior.</p> 
               <p>"By G-d! sir, I'll arrest you," was the passionate rejoinder.</p> 
               <p>"For what, if you please, Captain Desborough?" was the calm inquiry of the Cornet.</p> 
                
               <p>Now Captain Desborough had no desire to quarrel seriously with one whom he hoped to use, nor was Howard, albeit his inferior in rank, without influence which might set his malice at defiance. Lucky for him was then the interruption which occurred before he could make up his mind to frame a reply. Pale and gaunt, his head bound with a bloody cloth and his eyes gleaming with fires of malignancy and hatred, the Tory Johnson, who has been hitherto mentioned, was ushered in by the orderly on duty. Both officers started at the apparition.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Johnson, what means this?" demanded Captain Desborough-"What is the matter? Why is it you disappointed me this afternoon?"</p> 
               <p>"Only that I was waylaid, and well-nigh murdered, on my way; and it's well I 'scaped as I did, or there wouldn't have been a live man in your command to-morrow," replied the Tory, seating himself unbidden, and glancing wistfully at the decanters.</p> 
               <p>"There, man," said the British captain, pushing one towards him, "take a pull at that brandy, and let us have the story at once."</p> 
               <p>The tory complied promptly with the invitation, gulping down an enormous draft of raw spirit, and then, turning to the officer, began his narration:-</p> 
               <p>"Well, you see Cap'n, as I was riding through the green farm about three hours ago, on my way home to meet you, according to appointment, who should I meet but four or five of Widow Stanley's negro fellows with scythes and flails, coming out of the locust-grove. Thinking something was wrong, I rode up, and asked what they were about. Without answering, they called me a d-d tory, and set upon me on all sides. I drew my sword, cut two of them down, when I was struck from behind with a flail, knocked off my horse, and completely stunned for a moment. The black rascal would have finished me, but his companions took fright at the idea of killing a white man, and persuaded him off.</p> 
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6942-00000008"/> 
               <p>"Well, nebber mind, Massa Eddard cotch 'em all to-night, and do for 'em good,' said the nigger as they' went off.</p> 
               <p>"I had come to by this time, but lay still, <emph>possumin,</emph> to hear more. They left, me there, however, and made off to their quarters. As soon as they were gone, I caught my mare, and galloped on to Jim Shaler's, about half a mile off the road to my house. Jim's an old crony of mine, and if he <emph>is</emph> rather <emph>timersome</emph> about turning out for the king, he don't love the d-d rebels any better. So, sure enough, Jim tells me that young Stanley and about fifty of his devils passed the upper ford this morning, and he thinks they are lying down at the Hazelwood farm, about eight miles off. So you see, Captain, the thing was plain-there's an ambush; and if I hadn't been attacked by them niggers, we should have all been surrounded and cut to pieces at my house to-night."</p> 
               <p>"That is not saying much for the loyalty of your crony Jim," remarked Howard, contemptuously, as his captain, swelling with rage, fairly struggled for utterance.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Jim know'd nothing about your troop, you see," interposed Johnson.</p> 
               <p>By this time Captain Desborough had recovered both his feet and speech.</p> 
               <p>"Treason! treason! To arms! to arms! sir. Get the troop under arms immediately. We will burn, hang and quarter every d-d rebel, white or black, in the place. Where's the old beldame and her rebel daughter? I'll teach them to plot treason and plan murder against his majesty's soldiers."</p> 
               <p>Cornet Howard, who had taken a step forward to obey his commander, turned and said-</p> 
               <p>"I hope, sir, that no violence will be offered to the ladies of this house. If there be a plot, we have no evidence that they are parties to it; a soldier must meet his fate in ambush or open fight as a man; but to war upon women is a disgrace, to our noble profession, and dishonors the royal cause."</p> 
                
               <p>"Ha! who taught you rebellion? A pair of girlish eyes, ay? To your duty, sir! and leave to me to take care of the honor of the service."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>You!</emph>" said Howard, in a low, meaning tone.</p> 
               <p>"Do you dispute my orders, sir?" demanded Captain Desborough, quivering with rage, which his prudential motives could scarce suppress. "You are in open mutiny, sir! and by G-d, sir, I'll have you--"</p> 
               <p>"Stop! Captain Desborough," exclaimed the subaltern, in a tone so deep and firm that it thrilled to the Royalist Captain's heart-"your legal orders I obey with alacrity-your threats I despise-but the honor of the British service, sir, I question any man's right to cherish more dearly than myself."</p> 
               <p>And, without waiting for a reply, the young cornet departed. The reader is aware, from what has been already related of the tory Johnson's adventure with Tom, that his story so far as the rencontre with slaves of Mrs. Stanley was concerned, was a sheer fabrication; for the other part, however, there was more foundation. As soon as he had recovered from the blow dealt him by Tom, he made his way home on foot, and the distance being several miles, he did not arrive till after the departure of Captain Desborough's troop; that worthy who was anxious to reach his present quarters, having left word with the servants for his ally to follow him. Not having any very important news to communicate, and feeling some-what dissatisfied with the trim in which he was to appear before the king's officer, Johnson had nearly made a circuit, on his way, to consult his crony Sim Shaler, from whom he obtained information of Captain Stanley's presence in the neighborhood, although the story of an intended ambush was merely hatched up for an occasion to enhance the merit of his communication, since the commanders of each party were equally ignorant of the other's propinquity.</p> 
               <p>Rage, jealously and hatred burned in the breast of Captain Desborough as Howard left his presence, and under their excitement<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6942-00000009"/> citement a few seconds were sufficient for his mind to give birth to one of those cruel and hellish plots, for the execution of which Satan seems ever to provide a fitting agent. Turning to Johnson, whose countenance expressed some amazement at the manner in which he had been bearded, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Never mind that young cook, we'll soon cut his comb. How many men did you bring with you?"</p> 
               <p>"Only Harper and Black Dan," was the reply.</p> 
               <p>"Will you do my bidding at once, and without question?"</p> 
               <p>"That depends on the service; Captain. If it's for the king, you know I'm under orders; but if it's any little job of your own, I must ask what's the risk, and what's the pay?" said the tory, in tones which gave unmistakable evidence that the price, rather than the nature of the service, was the point to be settled.</p> 
               <p>"The price shall be ample, and the service is light. I have determined to own this fine plantation, and the surest way is to marry the old rebel beldame's daughter. Yonder smooth-faced puppy is in my way; I can see it at a glance, and this cursed ambush to night may defeat my plans completely. One word with you-she must be carried off this night-now, at once-do you understand? One hundred guineas in hand, and a thousand when I am in possession of the estate."</p> 
               <p>"Where shall I take her?"</p> 
               <p>"That must be your look for a few days-and mind she has no harm or disrespect, or your life shall answer. No word either of my name, as I may choose to play the deliverer."</p> 
               <p>"All right, captain," said the other hurriedly; "I have it, quick! the guineas. I hear your officer returning."</p> 
               <p>A heavy purse changed owners just as the steps of young Howard were heard in the passage returning to report the fulfilment of his orders. The tory passed him at the door, remarking, with great apparent deference-</p> 
               <p>"We may have brisk work to-night, cornet. The Captain has ordered me on a scout with my men, and mayhap we shall catch the rebels napping in their turn."</p> 
               <p>Howard was surprised at his commander's affability in receiving his report.</p> 
               <p>"So Howard, a nice trap the d-d rebels have set for us. Ring for the servant who has waited on us and tell him to summon his mistress-we'll see what she has to say to this d-d treachery."</p> 
               <p>Old Moses appeared at the summons and received the command, which he left the room at once to execute.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Mr. Howard," continued Captain Desborough-"quick! place a patrol to prevent any person from leaving the house, while I have a few seconds' talk with our hostess, and then place yourself at the head of the troop."</p> 
               <p>"Nay, never fear, sir," he added, as he perceived some reluctance on the part of his subordinate to leave him alone with the ladies; "I shall treat your friends with becoming consideration."</p> 
               <p>There was a sneer of triumph in his tone that stung the young officer.</p> 
               <p>"Not my friends, Captain Desborough, but ladies under the protection of an officer's honor."</p> 
               <p>"Very well, sir, obey your orders; I shall use no unnecessary rigor, though no punishment would be too severe for this deliberately planned murder of my troop."</p> 
               <p>The young officer departed ill-satisfied, and determined to hazard much to protect the ladies under whose roof he had enjoyed hospitality. He had scarce left before Mrs. Stanley, followed by Moses, but unaccompanied by her daughter, entered. It is as well to say that she had been informed of the arrival of the tory Johnson, but was ignorant of the news he had retailed as well as of the plot against her daughter; for even though under the circumstances it might have been excusable enough, she would neither authorize nor permit any espionage over her guests.</p> 
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6942-00000010"/> 
               <p>"The servant tells me you desire my presence, sir," said she, with dignity; looking somewhat surprised, if not disappointed, at the absence of the younger officer, in whom, with woman's tact, she had read those high and noble qualities which at once inspire the weak and oppressed in the hour of peril, with confidence in a champion.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, madam, I desire to know what treatment you expect, when beguiling his majesty's soldiers under the pretence of hospitality, you are engaged in a plot to have them massacred?"</p> 
               <p>"How? a plot! What mean you, sir?" said the widow, startled at so singular a charge.</p> 
               <p>"Rather what means, madam, this arming of your negroes, who, in conjunction with your son and his followers, were to fall upon my troop to-night, and if possible, destroy them!"</p> 
               <p>"You speak in riddles, sir; that my son, Captain Stanley, is anywhere in the neighborhood, I am ignorant; and as for my negroes being armed, it is simply false. "Although this was spoken with great firmness, Mrs. Stanley evidently showed apprehension in her countenance, so much that Capt. Desborough paused to revolve in his mind whether from her fears he might not wring some advantage, which idea did not seem to have struck him before. In the mean time the widow continued:-</p> 
               <p>"Oh! sir, if you really have information which leads you to expect a conflict with the patriot forces under my son, for heaven's sake! spare two unprotected females-a mother and sister-the scenes of strife and bloodshed. I appeal to you as a gentleman-a soldier. Or why not, by withdrawing your troop, avoid the conflict together-this partisan warfare is disgraceful to civilization without benefiting either side of the contest."</p> 
               <p>"And what reward must I expect, madam, for complying with your very moderate request to retreat with King George's troops from apprehension of a few raw continentals, a regiment of whom I could scatter at a single charge?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Thanks, sir! the deep thanks, the gratitude, the prayers of myself, my daughter."</p> 
               <p>"Methinks," said the British captain, "your fair daughter might be present to render them herself."</p> 
               <p>"Excuse her attendance, sir, she is not well," said the lady, shrinking with undefined apprehension from the mention of her daughter's name by his lips.</p> 
               <p>"Listen, madam," said Desborough, approaching closer, "I have a proposition to make, and but a few seconds to wait its answer. Your position is full of peril-your son is in extreme danger and must suffer punishment as soon as this rebellion is crushed, as it assuredly will be. Your estates will doubtless be confiscated-nay, the very plot which I have discovered now would excuse the severest summary measures on my part-but I have no wish to use rigor; I will afford you the means of escaping all these misfortunes, of finding safety, protection and happiness. Grant me your daughter's hand-pledge me your honor that speedily, as soon as a fitting occasion offers, she shall become my wife, and all will be well-your son pardoned, and commissioned in the royal service-yourself and property protected, and a position for her to which she could never otherwise aspire, for I have friends, high connexions-influence-I need only wealth to secure the highest grades in my profession-who knows, perhaps the government of a colony when they are subdued." Captain Desborough paused: he had delivered this proposition with an unction that seemed to inspire him with the hope of a successful answer, especially as the widow had listened with apparent calmness, if not deference. Something in the light of her eye, however, as her lips parted to reply, dispelled the vision.</p> 
               <p>"Quick, madam!" he exclaimed; "your answer, I have but a few moments to spare. Your daughter's hand, or bloodshed and desolation at your hearth! for I leave this house her affianced husband, or remain to chastise your rebel son, who.<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6942-00000011"/> I have it on good authority will be here at midnight, and shall make my preparations for defence accordingly."</p> 
               <p>"My daughter's hand to <emph>you!</emph>" exclaimed the matron, with noble dignity; "never! ruffian, never! Do your worst;" and she turned to leave the apartment.</p> 
               <p>The royalist captain took a step forward, his face flushed with rage, and laying his hand somewhat roughly on the lady's arm, cried in a passionate tone,-</p> 
               <p>"BEWARE! madam, be--"</p> 
               <p>What further he contemplated to say or do, it is impossible to say, for at that instant a wild shriek of fear and agony came through the open window, as if at some distance to the rear of the house.</p> 
               <p>"My daughter! my daughter!" exclaimed the mother, springing frantically from his grasp and rushing forth.</p> 
               <p>Captain Desborough also sallied forth instantly, by the front door, and arrived in sight of his troop, which were drawn up, just in time to see Howard, who had dashed the spurs into his charger, bounding forward to the scene of the confusion, which, by the moonlight, was distinctly seen about fifty yards in the rear of the house, near the negro quarters, where two men were lifting a female upon a horse, while a third was engaged in a fierce struggle with a gigantic black, who had pinioned his arms to his side, and effectually prevented him from using his weapons.</p> 
               <p>"Hold! stand firm! men. Halt! Mr. Howard," exclaimed Captain Desborough, who at once divined the meaning of the scene. The latter order might as well not have been given. A few bounds of his horse brought the young cornet up with the parties, and in good time, as the female, who was no other than Isabel Stanley, had fainted, and had just been placed on a powerful steed, which one of the ruffians was in the act of mounting, a single blow with his sabre brought the ruffian to the ground. His companion, releasing his hold, upon the unconscious Isabel, who slid off in the arms of her heroic mother, suddenly fired a pistol at Howard and fled. The young officer was stunned as with a blow, reeled in his saddle, and would have dropped, but for old Moses, who eased his fall. The struggle between Tom, for it was he, and the remaining ruffian, was already decided, the powerful slave having managed to grasp his antagonist by the throat, and reduce him, through a process of strangulation, to submission.</p> 
               <p>Affairs were now in a somewhat critical state for Captain Desborough, who, having mounted his charger, ordered a non-commissioned officer to keep the men fast while he rode forward. Another actor had, however, been added to the scene-a tall manly youth dressed in a hunting frock, a dark broad-rimmed beaver on, a rifle in his hand, and pistols and knife in his belt.</p> 
               <p>"Ha! my mother-Isabel! what means this outrage?"</p> 
               <p>"Captain Stanley? I believe," said the royalist. "Surrender! you are my prisoner."</p> 
               <p>"Hold, sir!" exclaimed Stanley, throwing up his rifle, which was cocked in a twinkling, and covering the body of the British officer. "Speak, move, or give an order, and you are a dead man. And now," said the young patriot, seeing that his promptness had checked the movement of his enemy, "worthy captain, our conditions are changed; you are my prisoner. Your troop will not move without your order, and the first syllable you utter sends a ball through your heart. Your condition, however, is otherwise helpless; there are fifty true American rifles covering your soldiers from yonder thicket, and the flash of my own gun brings death equally upon them. Now, sir, will you dismount and surrender yourself quietly, without forcing me to bloodshed at my own hearth? If there has been no foul wrong here, you shall be held as honorable prisoners of war: if there has, minion of a tyrant! look to your life!"</p> 
               <p>"No great harm you see, massa Ed'ard," said Tom, who<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6942-00000012"/> still held fast to the prostrate tory; "only dese dam tory rogues was gwine run off wid Miss Bel, but I nab one of 'em, and young massa officer there, cut todder down."</p> 
               <p>"I have no alternative, sir," said Desborough, doggedly, as he dismounted; "and as for wrong to your family, my officer wounded, perhaps mortally, in their defence, is sufficient answer."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! that must be looked to. Your sword, sir," and at a low whistle two men similarly equipped, glided forward. "Lieutenant Outlaw, go with this officer and receive the surrender of his troop; see that they are disarmed at once, and marched into the store-house yonder. If there is a sign of treachery, you know the signal. Sergeant Collins, as soon as the troopers have dismounted and given up their arms, move up the men, and quarter them around the house. You shall have further orders. And now, mother, how is it with you? Dear Belle, you are safe," said he, tenderly stooping and raising her in his arms.</p> 
               <p>"Heaven be praised! my dear boy; your sister is worse frightened than hurt, but let us look at this brave youth who rendered us such timely service."</p> 
               <p>"Here, Tom, carry your prisoner along and hand him over to Lieutenant Outlaw; then scamper and bring me a settee from the house."</p> 
               <p>In a few minutes the surrender of the British troopers was completed; and in the meantime young Howard, who gave some signs of returning consciousness, was carefully carried into the house, and made as comfortable as possible. His wound was pronounced dangerous, but not necessarily mortal, by a skilful surgeon who was with Captain Stanley's command, and this young officer in gratitude determined to afford him every attention in his power. The tory cut down by Howard, was Black Dan, as Johnson called him; he was quite dead, having his skull cleft fairly in two; the prisoner taken by Tom was Harker, and it was Johnson who for the moment escaped, but who was captured by a detachment left by Stanley on the road to intercept stragglers in case of a conflict.</p> 
               <p>In regard to the assault upon Isabel, what plan Johnson had fixed it is impossible to say; but fate seemed to have favored his nefarious project. On the arrival of Johnson being made known to the mother and daughter, they deemed it necessary to send Jim out of the way, and as old Moses happened to be the only servant in the house, and it was not prudent to withdraw him from attendance on the guests, lest some suspicion might arise, Isabel generously volunteered to go, and the distance was not great, and the back way uninterrupted. Jim would by no means permit his young mistress to return to the house without accompanying her to the door, and Johnson with his comrades meeting them on the way, determined to seize the opportunity of carrying off the young lady according to his agreement with Captain Desborough. As the news of the capture could not possibly spread so as to reach the British forces, which was only a day's march distant. Captain Stanley determined to remain one night at home. The next morningupon examination, Johnson, who stood in mortal dread of his countrymen, and particularly Edward Stanley, confessed the bargain with Captain Desborough. The indignation of the brother knew no bounds, and but for the counsels of his mother and the advice of his officers he would, perhaps, have taken summary vengeance; as it was, the royalist officer was hurried off with little ceremony, Howard, who was very weak, declining to see him. His exchange was subsequently effected solely on condition he should not be permitted to serve again in the war. Johnson and his companion received prompt justice; many murders and outrages having been proved upon them, they were executed shortly after by judgement of a court-martial.</p> 
               <p>Some six weeks after the above events the mother and daughter were again seated in the verandah, on an evening<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6942-00000013"/> as lovely as the soft climate of the South ever produced. They were not alone, for a pale and handsome youth was swinging gracefully in a hammock near by, and contemplating with half closed, dreamy eyes a beauty that filled his heart with deeper inspiration than bright skies, and smiling landscapes could do; the breathing, soul-entrancing beauty of young, innocent womanhood. The widow was absorbed in her work, and Isabel in a book, while Howard whom they both thought dozing, was drinking in the intoxicating draught of first love!</p> 
               <p>The quick gallop of a horse interrupted the quiet, and startled the occupants of the verandah. War had swept away from their neighborhood, and no rude shock had occurred to disturb them, since the eventful night we have just described; nevertheless, the times were sufficiently troublous for even so slight a circumstances to create apprehension. This feeling, however, was relieved when the rider came in sight, and proved to be a messenger with a packet for Howard; but to say that his arrival did not create some confusion in the camp would be an imputation upon the address of that skilful tactician with human hearts, Dan Cupid.</p> 
               <p>Dismissing with an ample reward the man who had been employed at some risk to communicate with the Royal Commander under whom he served, Howard asked permission of the ladies, and broke the seal of his dispatch.</p> 
               <p>For some minutes he was absorbed in the contents, and changes of feelings passed rapidly over his expressive countenance.</p> 
               <p>"Well, George," said the widow, who had watched his emotion with an interest scarcely surpassed by that of the fair daughter, "what news?"</p> 
               <p>"Unexpected, and somewhat embarrassing," was the reply; in these first place, my dear madam, it seems I am not to be an Earl, since my uncle has a male heir; in the next place, my good friend Lord Rawdon does not find my wish for retirement tirement so easy to be gratified-in fact, here is a Captain's commission, and assurance of every chance of promotion under his lordship's own eye."</p> 
               <p>"The first disappointment troubles me less than the latter, "she said, an unwonted seriousness settling upon her brow-"I have learned to appreciate your character too well to suppose the loss of prospective rank a great misfortune; but does Lord Rawdon find it impossible to gratify your wish to retire from the service in America, with honor, for I am equally bound to consult yours now?"</p> 
               <p>"He does indeed mention a contingency," said Howard, blushing, as his eyes stole to Isabel; "but I almost hesitate to name it, especially since the information first alluded to."</p> 
               <p>"And great injustice would you do both myself and your betrothed, by giving a moment's weight to such a consideration," remarked Mrs. Stanley, gravely.</p> 
               <p>"But, madam," said Howard, eagerly, having risen and approached the window, "in regard to Lord Rawdons hint-may I hope? Oh! say, would you indeed trust this fair hand to me?"-and drawing Isabel forward, they knelt at her feet-"Oh! will she trust herself across the wide ocean with a stranger-an enemy?"</p> 
               <p>"There, my children," said Mrs. Stanley; "hard as the sacrifice must be for me, I will not deprive your bright young lives of one day's mutual joy; I have thought of going to my sister at Richmond. Edward is devoted heart and body to his country, and I would not withdraw him. We should be lonely, and perhaps in danger here; accompany me thither, and when I have given you this dear one, take her if you will among your kindred, though I trust the day is not far distant when peace will allow us to meet under happier auspices. And oh! George, cherish her-she is worthy of all your love."</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>There was not a lovelier lady in the gay saloons of London than Isabel Howard, "THE REBEL BRIDE," as she was playfully<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6942-00000014"/> fully called. And if she pined occasionally for her native home, all a husband's love could do to soothe the regret was hers.</p> 
               <p>It was about four years after the date of our story that Isabel, who had heard frequently in the intermediate time from her mother and Edward, who had risen high in the continental service, was at a brilliant party in a noble mansion of London. Lord C--, distinguished for his generous and judicious friendship to the struggling colonies, and who had been also a friend and patron of Howard, now rising rapidly in his parliamentary career, came up to her:</p> 
               <p>"My dear Mrs. Howard, where is your husband? I have news for him-good, <emph>you</emph> will no doubt term it. The Independence of the colonies is acknowledged."</p> 
               <p>"Hear!' said Isabel to her husband, who had just come up, "at last we may go home!"</p> 
               <p>Lord C. and Howard both smiled. The former soon communicated to the latter a diplomatic mission to America, which was thankfully accepted.</p> 
               <p>At the close of his duties, Howard, who transferred his ample fortune to the United States, resolved to become a citizen of the Republic, and in truth rendered important services, at a later period, in a civil capacity, to the country of his adoption.</p> 
               <p>Quiet and happy were the evening days of the Widow Stanley, as she saw fair daughters and manly sons grow up to bless the union her generous self-sacrifice had consecrated.</p>

               <head>THE CRUISE OF THE WASP.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A NAVAL SKETCH FROM THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.</head> 
               <p>IT is somewhat too general to attribute the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">prestige</foreign> and renown which our navy enjoys to the war of 1812, to the prejudice of those brave and gallant spirits, the naval heroes of the Revolution! While the well-earned glories of Decatur, Hull, Bainbridge, and their compeers, have found innumerable eulogists, with the exception of Paul Jones, Truxton, Barney, and one or two others, the earlier exploits of our naval men seem to have been forgotten. To rescue any one of these from oblivion is a pleasing task.</p> 
               <p>It was at a fine old mansion on the banks of the Delaware, just after the breaking out of the Revolutionary war, that a large company was assembled. Mr. Woodville, the proprietor, was a royalist in feeling, though he proposed to take no active part in the struggle which had commenced. Like many others at that period whose fortunes were bound up in the prosperity of the colonies, he found it exceedingly difficult to decide between interest and inclination, and hence assumed the position of a neutral which his advanced age rendered more excusable. It was the policy of both parties, especially in the beginning of our revolutionary struggle, to respect such neutrality and, not unfrequently, the houses of neutrals afforded an opportunity for persons directly opposed in their political opinions to meet. Such was the case on the present occasion. Among the royalists, however, who were largely in the majority, were several officers belonging both to the army and navy of the king, while it was not known if any<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6942-00000015"/> one present who favored the views of the Colonists had gone so far as to enrol himself under the banner of rebellion. An animated discussion as to the possibility of success on the part of the Colonists had been going on, maintained with arrogance on the one side, and coolness but firmness on the other. Among the disputants might have been distinguished two young men, each alike of high tone and bearing. They were somewhat angered, and evidently restrained only by the respect due to their host and his company from a more violent issue.</p> 
               <p>"I tell you, sir, it is the presumption of madness to suppose that this rebellion can last more than a few months. Without an army or navy, what can these poor provincials do to maintain themselves against the well disciplined forces of his majesty?"</p> 
               <p>The speaker wore an undress naval uniform, and exhibited an air of confidence and hauteur peculiar to his profession and nation, especially at that day when the assertion that "Britannia rules the waves" was less doubtful than it is now.</p> 
               <p>"Lexington and Bunker Hill are evidences of what brave men dare do for their liberties," was the curt reply.</p> 
               <p>The face of the British officer reddened as he said in a more moderate tone:</p> 
               <p>"The mere undisciplined valor of an infuriated mob, sir! which was nevertheless compelled to yield to the courage and firmness of our troops. But I ask you, sir, as having exhibited no small knowledge of the sea, what the Colonists can do without a navy, even if enabled to hold out for some time on the land?"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps they may build one."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! ha! a likely idea. Perhaps you mean, too, that they will sweep the 'wooden walls of Old England' from the ocean. You do not mean seriously that the rebel flag will ever dare flaunt itself on the blue water? Why, with my little brigantine, I would engage to capture the largest ship they could ever put afloat."</p> 
                
               <p>"I may remember your boast hereafter."</p> 
               <p>"Why, sir, am I speaking to one of the future naval heroes of America?" asked the other, in a tone of derision which was almost insulting.</p> 
               <p>What might have been the reply of the high-spirited youth, who was defending the cause of the colonists, it is not easy to say; but, happily, at that moment, a sweet and playful voice broke in on their conversation.</p> 
               <p>"Come, come, Charlie; I want you to go down to the river bank with me, and see what a squadron of white sails there are. Perhaps Lieutenant Welden will accompany us."</p> 
               <p>This was said by a gay and laughing girl of nineteen, who had watched from time to time the controversy between the young men, with considerable interest, and took occasion, in an opportune moment, to divert them from a serious misunderstanding. Both gentlemen eagerly accepted her offer, and the trio repaired to the lawn in front of the house, from whence an extended view stretched out over the broad Delaware. The sun shone brightly; a fresh breeze curled the waters, and a number of white sails, belonging chiefly to small coasting crafts, danced merrily in the breeze.</p> 
               <p>The loveliness of the scene, and the soft influence of woman's presence restored equanimity to the minds of the late disputants, and each enjoyed for a while the beauties around them. Among the craft passing to and fro was one of larger build, and more exquisite model than the rest, which attracted the admiration of our party.</p> 
               <p>"See, cousin Charles, what a perfect beauty there is," exclaimed Florence Woodville.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and as fleet as she is beautiful."</p> 
               <p>"You know her, then?" asked the English officer, with animation.</p> 
               <p>"The brave little Wasp! to be sure I do. She belongs to a friend of mine in Philadelphia."</p> 
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6942-00000016"/> 
               <p>"The Wasp! her name is rather warlike for a peaceable trader."</p> 
               <p>"Aye! and with a proper armament she would make as gallant a skimmer as ever floated on the seas, nor be afraid to show her wings in sight of your meteor flag, Signor."</p> 
               <p>This was said with an animation that caused Florence to look uneasy again. The Briton, however, replied without the irascibility which he had previously shown.</p> 
               <p>"Well, you and I must run a tilt on the ocean yet, I suppose. So there is my gage that when you command a vessel in the Colonies' service, be she a line of battle-ship or the trig little Wasp, I will give you a meeting in honor of this fair lady here." This was said playfully, and the Lieutenant threw down his gloves.</p> 
               <p>"I accept the challenge!" said the other, drawing a deep breath, as he took up the gauntlet and put it in his bosom.</p> 
               <p>The earnestness of the action somewhat startled the British officer.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps you already hold their Highnesses' commission, and I am addressing Captain Alexander," said he, with mock humility.</p> 
               <p>Florence again interposed: "What folly you are talking, gentlemen; Charlie holds no commission except from me, to give me a sail some day in his friend's handsome yacht. But come, I see Cato is about to ring his bell to let us know dinner waits."</p> 
               <p>A brief glance at the characters thus introduced will facilitate the progress of our story. Florence Woodville was the only daughter of the gentleman into whose mansion I have introduced the reader. She was a free-hearted, brave, and high-spirited girl; somewhat independent in her manners, and yet cautious where the interests or feelings of those she loved were concerned. Cousin Charlie was a particular favorite with her, especially as she thought him slighted by her father. Charles Alexander was a brave and gallant man, of Scotch birth, and inheriting, it may be, something of ancestral repugnance to the vaunted supremacy of England. He had followed the sea in early life, with a view to make it his profession, but inheriting a handsome fortune, and having no very near connections at home, he had moved to the Colonies as a field better open to his energies. The nephew by marriage of Mr. Woodville, he had always received kindness and attention from that gentleman, until the latter had some how taken it into his head that the handsome young sailor was not altogether a safe companion for his daughter, or rather that he might acquire pretensions unfavorable to his own views in regard to her future. Now it was the most natural thing in the world that Charles Alexander should fall in love with his beautiful cousin, but that her regard would have taken a warmer hue than mere sisterly affection may be doubted, if her father had not, by the very pains he took to prevent it, taught her that there was another passion she might possibly entertain. There was no pretext on which Mr. Woodville could forbid the visits of his nephew, as there had been no open avowal of his preference for Florence, and no occasion therefore for dismissing him; but suspicion is a weed of rapid growth, even when nourished on more barren ground than in this case, and so, without venturing to bring the question to an issue, he began to entertain a stronger dislike every day towards his young relative, which he could not altogether disguise, and which would have given Charles ready offence if Florry's winning kindness and his own heart's inclinations had not somewhat blunted his sensitiveness to the old man's slights.</p> 
               <p>On one subject Mr. Woodville had made up his mind; to accept the first eligible offer for Florence's hand; and as rank and fortune were the qualifications he most required, since the troubles had brought over a great many persons of distinction, he opened his hospitable mansion, and made it a favored resort, especially for the officers of the royalist forces.</p> 
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6942-00000017"/> 
               <p>Among those whom Florence's beauty and her father's wealth had already attracted, was a young English naval officer of high rank. He had met her some eighteen months previously in Philadelphia, and after due inquiries, made up his mind that she was worth pursuit. Lord R--was of the highest aristocracy, but as there were two good lives between him and his father's marquisate, he had been sent into the navy to take advantage of the family influence, and though promotion was rapid, yet the want of fortune kept him in active service, so that he thought a pretty wife to grace his title, and a large dowry to support their joint dignity, would be very acceptable</p> 
               <p>At the time when we open our story, Lord R--was a guest at Woodville Hall. His pretensions were already known to and approved by the father, although the daughter was ignorant, except as to such knowledge of preference as might be gathered from his general tone of gallantry. Lord R--was at the time in command of a fine frigate which cruised off the capes of Delaware, and occasionally came to anchor that his lordship might enjoy a short visit to Woodville. At this early day there was no adequate protection, scarce a show of naval resistance to prevent the armed cruisers of the king from frequenting our waters, and often committing the most outrageous depredations.</p> 
               <p>Lieutenant Welden, whom we have already mentioned, was a young officer, a sort of protege of the noble captain, who was in command of a brig tender. What the connection between the two was, often puzzled the world; for wherever Lord R--was, Lieutenant Welden was employed in some service near him, and yet neither cordially or kindly regard seemed to exist between them.</p> 
               <p>Let the position of my characters rest thus for the present.</p> 
               <p>As our young friends returned to the house, Florence found an opportunity to lecture her cousin for his imprudence.</p> 
               <p>"I admit, dear Florry, it is hard to curb my fiery temper, but for your sake, I will try. So do not scold and if you desire it, I will really give you a sail in the Wisp to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do you mean it, Charlie? I should like it above everything. But how can you?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, she will probably anchor a few miles above tonight, and as I know the captain, a note from me will place her at our disposal, if his engagements are not pressing."</p> 
               <p>"Dear me! how nice. Do you hear that, Mr. Welden?" said she to that gentleman, who had gone a little ahead. "Charles promises us a sail in the Wasp to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"I should be happy to accept, especially as I may have a chance to learn something of the qualities of my future fee," said he, jestingly.</p> 
               <p>On his arrival at the house, Charles dispatched a boy with a note to the captain of the Wasp. Dinner passed off quietly; Lieutenant Welden and Charles hob-nobbed together, note withstanding their controversy and the challenge between them, the latter consideration being weighed by the English officer as a light jest.</p> 
               <p>The next morning the arrival of the Wasp was announced at the breakfast table, and the party, all of whom had received notice of the promised excursion, prepared in high spirits to go on board. A plentiful stock of provisions, under the charge of old Cato, were sent on board, and with a fair day and a good breeze, the party embarked. Charles Alexander was saluted at once by the crew with deference as their commander, which station he evidently intended to occupy for the occasion at least. The British officers were somewhat surprised at the appearance of the little craft, for though there was not the slightest sign of an armament on board, yet she was evidently no common trading vessel; on the contrary, everything was in the most perfect order, and her build and rig of the most substantial kind, so that indeed, a few guns and a full complement of men, alone were required to have made the little Wasp a formidable cruiser.</p> 
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6942-00000018"/> 
               <p>All went pleasantly and smoothly until they had opened the bay, when' our hero made preparations to put his schooner on the other tack, for the purpose of returning up the river.</p> 
               <p>"Hold on!" exclaimed Lord R--, who had paid but little attention hitherto to any thing on board except himself and the fair Florence, with whom he was seriously endeavoring to ingratiate himself. "Hold on! My frigate is doubtless at anchor in the outer channel; we will board her."</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me, my lord, but if we do so, we shall scarcely get back to-night."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do let us get back, by all means, before night," chimed in Florence.</p> 
               <p>"I will guaranty you, my dear Miss Woodville, against all mishaps or inconveniences; and I should be so happy to entertain you on board the Liverpool, that I must really press my invitation. What says your worthy father?"</p> 
               <p>"That he will be most happy to accept your polite invitation. Florence, my dear, you will have an opportunity of enjoying one of the finest sights in the world-a large warship in battle array."</p> 
               <p>The obedient daughter could not refuse, though she looked troubled.</p> 
               <p>"Come, it is all arranged then," said Lord R--"so hold on your course, sir, or rather let her go a little free, and we shall soon make the frigate."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry, my lord, to interfere with so agreeable an arrangement, but the Wasp must return," said Alexander, in a quiet but firm tone.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Must?</emph>" replied his lordship, haughtily. "On what compulsion, pray?"</p> 
               <p>"Simply that I desire to return her sooner than she could make the trip you propose; and that, moreover, such an arrangement would not be agreeable to her owners."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! I will pay for her detention," said the young nobleman, sneeringly.</p> 
                
               <p>The cheek of Alexander burned like fire, but with a strong effort he repressed every emotion, and said in a calm tone:-</p> 
               <p>"Your lordship compels me to remind you that you are <emph>my guest.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Oh! you are the owner, then," said Lord R--, smarting under this home thrust-"and pray, sir what colors do you sail under? You have not honored us with the sight of your flag."</p> 
               <p>"The Wasp <emph>has a flag,</emph> my lord, which would not be so agreeable to your pride to sail under. Courtesy has forbidden me to hoist it, and the Wasp shall never carry another."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! the rebel flag? and doubtless this trim little craft is already in the rebel service. I shall make bold, sir, then, to arrest you, and seize the schooner," said Lord R--rising.</p> 
               <p>"Your lordship will perhaps first inquire whether you have the power, even if it were honorable to do so, situated as you are."</p> 
               <p>"The power," replied the Englishman, contemptuously. "Here are six of us loyal gentlemen and officers, and I see nothing to prevent me from carrying this craft under the guns of the Liverpool, as I certainly shall do. For the sake of our host I will not detain you as a prisoner."</p> 
               <p>Charles Alexander smiled proudly as he threw his left hand aloft; one of the three sailors who had acted as crew, immediately passed some word down the fore-hatch, the action having been taken simply for an emphatic gesture, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"Happily your lordship's intentions are easily frustrated; look there!"</p> 
               <p>As he spoke, some ten or fifteen armed men sprang quickly from below, and ranged themselves along the deck.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! cousin Charles, for heaven's sake!" exclaimed Florence, who had been a pained spectator to his controversy with Lord R--. That officer immediately grasped his sword and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Draw, gentlemen, and cut down the rebels!"</p> 
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6942-00000019"/> 
               <p>"Hold!" spoke Alexander, in tones of command. "Keep the peace, sir, and you have nothing to apprehend. Your effort would be fruitless. It was not <emph>my</emph> wish to mar the harmony of our party; and I merely show you now that your power to commit an unworthy action is not equal to your will. I pray the company therefore to make themselves easy, as I will relieve them from the presence of my crew at once," and at a sign the men disappeared below, except the ordinary crew.</p> 
               <p>"You shall account to me for this insolence, sir!" said Lord R--biting his lip.</p> 
               <p>"When and where your lordship chooses," was the prompt reply.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Woodville fidgetted, looked angry, but said nothing, and poor Florence was the picture of misery.</p> 
               <p>Charles went forward under the pretence of attending to something in connection with the schooner, that he might relieve the party of the embarrassment of his presence. The Wasp having been put on the other tack was bowling along under a freshening breeze at a rate that bid fair soon to bring them to their destination.</p> 
               <p>As our hero was standing on the Ice-side with mainsail between him and his company, gazing thoughtfully on the rippling waters, he felt a touch on his arm, and turning he saw Lieutenant Welden.</p> 
               <p>"Captain Alexander, I congratulate you-we shall meet in truth then; you hold my gage."</p> 
               <p>"You shall not lack the opportunity, if I can help, to win it back, sir," said Alexander, somewhat haughtily.</p> 
               <p>"I mean in all honor and fairness, sir," said the other extending his hand.</p> 
               <p>Charles grasped it warmly, as he said-"In which spirit I accept your defiance."</p> 
               <p>The party were landed at Woodville a little before dark. Charles did not think it proper to accompany them to the mansion, and they parted with the most formal coldness. For an explanation of a few minutes only with Florence he would have given worlds, but there was no opportunity. However, he detained Cato on some pretext, and gave him a hastily pencilled note for her, beseeching an interview before they parted, as he feared for a long, long time.</p> 
               <p>Now it so happened that Lord R--saw Cato deliver this little missive, and suspecting at once the source from whence it came, the irritation which he felt towards Charles Alexander was increased to perfect hatred, and he resolved to compass a deep revenge against the man who had despised his authority, bearded and baffled him, and now dared to hold secret correspondence with the woman he designed to honor with his hand.</p> 
               <p>Our hero received an answer that his cousin would meet him at sunrise at the garden house about a hundred yards from the mansion. It was a beautiful moon lighted evening, and Charles, after making all necessary arrangements for the night, stepped ashore for a solitary stroll along the banks of the river. He had not been long there before he saw two persons coming towards him whom he was surprised to recognise, on their approach, as his cousin attended by Lieutenant Welden. They did not come exactly from the direction of the mansion, and paused just where a clump of trees intercepted the view therefrom. Charles hastened to meet them.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Florence," exclaimed Alexander, startled at this unexpected rencounter, but knowing his cousin well enough to be satisfied there was good cause for her conduct, "what under heaven has happened?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing as yet, Charlie; but, Lieutenant Welden has a communication for your service."</p> 
               <p>"Captain Alexander, however opposed our sentiments on one subject may be, I admire and respect you as a brave man and a gentleman, whom I shall be glad to meet some day in a fair and open action; but I do not wish to see you, or any<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6942-00000020"/> other brave seaman the victim of a plot; and therefore I have come to advise you to make sail from this with all dispatch."</p> 
               <p>"What is the danger, sir-pray explain?"</p> 
               <p>"I would rather you trusted my word and acted upon the warning. I felt it my duty to explain circumstances which came to my knowledge an hour or two since to your fair relative here; and learning that you only delayed for an interview with herself, I offered my escort which she has done me the honor to accept, that you might receive timely notice of the danger, and have an opportunity to take leave of your cousin."</p> 
               <p>"Your conduct is noble, sir, and I will never forget it. But I apprehend that I have force enough to resist any attempt your noble commander could make at present, as this blow is threatened by him, of course."</p> 
               <p>"You might find yourself mistaken, and you do not know Lord R--, to risk yourself in his power. He is in communication with a band of men in this neighborhood who are little better in my estimation than pirates; their chief has had an interview within the last two hours with him, and I am sure they have a plot to surprise your schooner during the night and make you all prisoners."</p> 
               <p>"Enough, sir; I will-act on your advice, though nothing would please me better than to meet the knaves; but I will not make this honored home a scene of strife. Accept my sincerest thanks; and permit me to return the gage of strife which is between us."</p> 
               <p>"By no means; I will be prouder to win it back from one whom I can respect. An honorable foe is next to a bosom friend. And now permit me to withdraw until you have spoken to your cousin; let me advise you to brief, and when you want me just throw out a signal."</p> 
               <p>The interview between Charles Alexander and Florence Woodville was brief, but most satisfactory to our hero. The fair girl knew not until difficulties thus beset them, how dear her brave and manly cousin was to her; and with the frankness of her nature she readily gave him all the assurances of constancy he could desire. The Lieutenant was summoned even sooner than he expected; and grasping the generous sailor's hand, Charles again reiterated his thanks. The two then returned by the same route they had come.</p> 
               <p>About midnight, a band of some forty torics stole along the banks of the river, but when they came to the place of their destination they found their prey gone, and a white sail glancing in the moonlight some miles up the river, was all they saw of the Wasp. With muttered curses they returned on their tracks.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>It was some six months after the foregoing events, that two British frigates were anchored in the Delaware. One was the Roebuck, 44 guns, the other the Liverpool, 28 guns, commanded by Lord R--. From the deck of the latter, two officers were intently watching the movements of an inward bound schooner, which was standing boldly for the entrance of the river.</p> 
               <p>"Methinks I know that build and rig; what say you, sir?" asked the one-he was Lord R--, of his companion.</p> 
               <p>"That it is, certainly, our old friend, the Wasp, replied Lieutenant Welden. "Would to God my brig had returned."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! and that same insolent renegrade is in command; I heard a day or two since, that he had convoyed a vessel to sea. Order all hands to up anchor at once; quarter-master, signalize the Commodore for permission to make chase."</p> 
               <p>Both orders were promptly obeyed, and in an incredibly short space of time the Liverpool was under full sail. Steering so as to intercept the schooner, which still kept on her course, the frigate was rapidly nearing the chase. When about two miles off, the latter fired a gun, and before the<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6942-00000021"/> smoke cleared away, a flag fluttered from her peak, and another from her mast-head.</p> 
               <p>"The insolent renegade!" exclaimed Lord R--"we will teach him his place soon. What rag is that which he has hoisted? Can you make out, Mr. Welden?"</p> 
               <p>"It is the rebel flag at the peak, sir," replied the Lieutenant, looking intently through his glass; "but I cannot make out what he carries at his mast-head. It is white flag, with some device in the centre. No!-yes! it is a glove! My own gage! There can be no doubt who he is, sir; would to God my brig were here."</p> 
               <p>"Let her come up a point; you are keeping too much away," said the captain to the sailing-master, who was conning the frigate.</p> 
               <p>"I fear we are shoaling, sir; had I not better send a man in the chains with a lead, sir?" demanded the officer of the deck.</p> 
               <p>"By all means, sir; why has it been neglected?"</p> 
               <p>The precaution came too late, however; for the frigate just then touched. Shoal water was plainly visible under her lee bow.</p> 
               <p>"Luff! sir, luff!" exclaimed the commander. "All hands to shorten sail!"</p> 
               <p>These precautions were too late, however; the helm was put down, but it merely deadened her headway, as she ran smoothly up on to a mud bank, and brought up all standing. The accident was not a very serious one; in endeavoring to make a clear cut across the shallows without a pilot, the frigate had grounded, and must wait some hours for the tide. This had doubtless been foreseen by those on board the schooner, or they would not have stood so boldly on. At the time of the mishap the two crafts were not more than three-quarters of a mile apart; and the English captain immediately ordered the guns manned in hopes of crippling the schooner at long shot. The American commander had, however, attained the position desired, and putting his helm up, kept away, running quickly and without damage beyond the range of the enemy's guns, and entering the Cape May Channel where she found two other American vessels snugly at anchor, the brig Lexington, Captain Barry and the ship Surprise, Captain Weeks, who had been ignorant of the near vicinity of the enemy.</p> 
               <p>In a few hours after the Wasp had joined this force, a vessel was discovered standing for the cape, with the Liverpool frigate, which had by this time cleared the shoals, in close chase. This vessel was known to be one anxiously expected in the Delaware, loaded with small arms and ammunition for the Americans, and the three vessels immediately made preparations to afford her all the protection and assistance in their power. They had scarcely concerted the means of efficient co-operation, when the other frigate, the Roebuck, also appeared in full chase. Against both of these frigates, there was of course little or no hope of saving the vessel, which must have fallen into their hands had not the master of her thought best to run her ashore. This was effected a few miles northward of the cape; and the Americans, immediately on perceiving it, sent all their boats and men to assist in taking out her cargo. This they in a great measure accomplished under a heavy fire from the frigates, which were still approaching, evidently with the design of sending their boats to take possession of her. Lieutenant Weeks, of the Surprise, was killed, and several men wounded, but the Americans still persevered until the enemy's boats, manned with double their numbers, were fast pulling towards them, when Captain Barry, who was in command of the expedition, ordering a quantity of powder to be thrown loose in the hold, and wrapping a billet of burning wood in the mainsail over the hatchway, made a hasty retreat. It was simply intended to destroy the remainder of her cargo, to prevent their falling into the enemy's hands, but the precaution he had used to prevent an explosion until his own boats were out of reach, gave time for<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6942-00000022"/> the enemy to come up and board the vessel, and it became, however unintended, a terrible retribution for their many acts of wanton cruelty. The destruction was complete, and the loss of the British must have been immense, both in men and officers; dead bodies and mangled limbs, gold laced hats, and other parts of officers' equipments, being thrown ashore for many days after.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, the armed brig commanded by Lieutenant Welden had joined the frigates, and he had resumed his position on board. Soon after the boats returned to their respective vessels, the Wasp again weighed anchor and made sail up the bay. This movement was perceived on board the frigates, both of which, accompanied by the armed brig, gave chase, determined, no doubt, to wreak vengeance on the Wasp for their late discomfiture and loss. Captain Alexander, finding that they gained on him rapidly, and that by trusting to the speed of his vessel he would certainly fall into their hands, suddenly hauled his wind and ran into Wilmington Creek, where he was safe from the pursuit of the frigates, and ready for the brig if she should dare the contest alone. And he had some hopes that she would do so, for he was aware who her commander was, and had perceived with joy during the chase she carried a flag at her foremast head with a device similar. Towards Lieutenant Welden personally he felt respect and gratitude, but every principle of honor and chivalry required him to fulfill the wager of battle between them, and measure his own skill and courage in a fair fight against the vaunted prowess of Britain. By the time he had dropped his anchor, however, night and fog came on, and he was unable to tell what disposition his pursuers had made. At daylight next morning he discovered that all three vessels had anchored off the mouth of the creek, and effectually blockaded him, unless by some daring stratagem he could effect his deliverance.</p> 
               <p>It happened that, in the course of the previous day, Captain Alexander, while chased by the frigate, had spoken several merchantmen from Philadelphia, outward bound, with valuable cargoes, ignorant of their danger. They had put back in obedience to the friendly warning, and carried the news of the enemy's approach, so that a number of galleys were expedited to the scene under the command of Commodore Hazlewood, which, by great exertion, made their appearance before the enemy early in the morning, and commenced a brisk cannonade. Captain Alexander thought this a favorable moment to make a movement, and assist if possible in annoying the foe. Much to his disappointment and chagrin, he saw the brig lying close under the cover of the guns of the two frigates, her signal of defiance was no longer flying, and no disposition evinced to meet him in single combat. He was too just, however, to attribute this to any unmanly disposition on the part of her commander, and felt sure that it was no fault of his, but the orders of his superiors, which compelled Lieutenant Welden to decline a meeting which he himself proffered. Captain Alexander determined, however, that he should have an opportunity of redeeming his honor; and, as the two frigates seemed to be fully occupied with the gun-boats, he resolved upon the daring expedient of attacking the brig at anchor, and carrying her by a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de main.</foreign> His anchor was up in a moment, oars manned, and the schooner swept out of the creek. A good breeze now favored his manuvre, but the utmost caution was necessary; to engage the brig with his guns was only to bring destruction on himself from the frigates, a few well-directed shots from which would sink or cripple him. His only chance was to board the brig at once, and carry her as quick as possible. Even to do this, required skill as well as courage; it was necessary so to steer so as to keep the brig as nearly as possible in the line of fire between himself and the frigates' batteries. In his efforts he was happily seconded by a brave and gallant youth serving<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6942-00000023"/> under him as a volunteer, but who was afterwards known to fame as <emph>Commodore Barney.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>Lieutcnant Welden saw the approach of the schooner with secret satisfaction, for, as was surmised, he had been prevented by superior orders from offering battle, as he would have done. The losses of the day previous had made him short-handed, which was the reason of his superiors' prudence, but he regarded this little. His crew were all at their quarters, and everything prepared to give the Wasp a warm reception; but, with a chivalry consistent with his character, he waited for her to take her own distance, and forbore to pour in his broadside even after she was within full range. Onward!-nearer and nearer came the schooner, swerving not a point from her course.</p> 
               <p>"He's a gallant fellow!" exclaimed Lieutenant Welden to his next in command; "and seems determined to give us just what British sailors like-close quarters."</p> 
               <p>"See, sir! by G-! he hasn't even his tompions out, not a single match lit, that I can see; what does it mean?"</p> 
               <p>"Mean?" exclaimed Welden, jumping up on a gun-slide, "by G-he means to run us aboard! Quick, men, stand by your guns-"Fire!"</p> 
               <p>The haste in which the brig's broadside was fired prevented its doing any execution, except some slight damage to the schooner's sails and running rigging. The order of "All hands to repel boarders! followed quickly, but there was little time for preparation. The schooner sheered up alongside, threw her boarders on board, at the same moment that hands stationed for that purpose fastened grapnels on to the brig's fore rigging; another part of this bold and adroit manuvre was executed with equal success, while the boarders pouring into the brig from the waist of the schooner attracted the whole attention of the foe in the endeavor to repel them, so that the fixing of the grapnels became comparatively an easy matter. Young Barney was stationed forward with two or three active hands who sprang on board and without delay or opposition cut her cables, so that the Wasp scarcely lost her headway, before she <emph>was actually towing her foe along,</emph> and carrying her out of the reach of the frigates, while the hand-to-hand conflict was raging on her decks.</p> 
               <p>This brilliant exploit, seemingly impossible it may be to the landsman, but perfectly intelligible to the seaman, was never perhaps surpassed for skill, activity and daring in the annals of naval warfare.</p> 
               <p>Well and bravely did the British sailors maintain their reputation that day; but they were outnumbered and disheartened by the unlooked-for manuvre and resistless impetuosity of the enemy. Lieutenant Welden was everywhere cheering his crew by words and example; but Barney, his task accomplished, rushed aft like a young lion, followed by his men, and took them in flank, while Captain Alexander swept circle after circle into their ranks with his trenchant sabre. At last the two commanders crossed swords.</p> 
               <p>"Surrender!" shouted Alexander, "your brig is lost!"</p> 
               <p>"Never!" exclaimed the brave Englishman, striking a furious blow at his opponent, which the latter caught promptly on his sabre.</p> 
               <p>"Yield! Captain Welden, you have fought bravely; but fate is against you. See! we are already carrying you off a captive. We shall soon be out of the reach of the frigates."</p> 
               <p>The British officer cast a hasty glance over the side of his vessel, and became aware, for the first time, of his situation.</p> 
               <p>"Never!" exclaimed he again, however with indomitable courage, preparing to renew the contest. "I did not ask odds in the beginning and scorn it now!"</p> 
               <p>"Hold! sir, one moment," said Alexander, "your men have accepted the implied truce which our parley held out. Look at their numbers and mine. There is no chance to maintain your position five minutes; a brave man should not spill<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6942-00000024"/> the blood of his men uselessly. Yield, sir! you have done enough for honor!"</p> 
               <p>"You are right, sir;" replied Welden, despondingly. "But I little thought I should ever live to strike my flag."</p> 
               <p>"Welden," said Captain Alexander, grasping the hand of his adversary. "you are a brave man-keep your sword; I cannot take it, nor do I wish to give you the pain of seeing your flag lowered. Order your men to lay down their arms and go below. I accept your parole both for you and them."</p> 
               <p>The only reply was a strong grip of the hands and a tear in the brave soldier's eye. Complying with the directions of his captor, the British officer and his men had soon cleared the deck, taking their wounded below with them.</p> 
               <p>"Barney," said Captain Alexander, "to you, my boy, belongs the honor of lowering yon haughty flag, you have won it well; but delay a short while, so long as if floats they will be less ready on board the frigates to disturb us-they have their hands full, and may think our brave opponent is holding his own. In the meantime, quick! pick out a few of our best men, send one or two aloft to loose the brig's sails, she is not hurt, and have everything ready to sheet home in a moment."</p> 
               <p>His orders were obeyed almost as soon as they were issued. But they were evidently becoming suspicious on board the frigate, for a boat full of armed men put off from the side of the Roebuck.</p> 
               <p>"Now, Barney, is your time," exclaimed Captain Alexander. "Let fall! sheet home! brisk, boys. Cast off forward, there!" he continued, stepping lightly on board the Wasp. "Fire! quarter-master."</p> 
               <p>The change which took place under these prompt, energetic orders, was like magic. As young Barney, with his own hands, hauled down the meteor flag of England, a cloud of canvass covered the brig, the grapnels were cast loose, and a parting gun of defiance greeted the "star-spangled banner." which floated where lately was the proud ensign of England. Both vessels had good headway on them and were fast leaving the frigates, on board which the utmost surprise and confusion prevailed; and by which a movement was promptly made to defeat this bold and daring manuvre-what would have been the result, as both were fast sailers, can scarcely be doubtful; but fortune still favored the American commander-the Roebuck, almost at the commencement of the movement, grounded on the Jersey shore, and the Liverpool was thus compelled to come to an anchor close by her, to prevent her from being captured by the galleys. This lucky disaster enabled Captain Alexander to get off with his prize, which he sent safely into port on the Jersey side, and returned himself in triumph, a little before nightfall, to Wilmington Creek.</p> 
               <p>Lieutenant Welden was transferred by choice to the Wasp, it being the intention of his friendly captor to afford him the first opportunity of an exchange. From him, Alexander heard news of his cousin. Her father had forced her, it was believed, into an engagement with Lord R--. They were both to take passage with him to England, in a few weeks, when his frigate would be relieved, and where the marriage would be solemnized, report said.</p> 
               <p>"And his lordship would doubtless be pleased to take me along, as a captive, to grace his triumph. I have heard he has sworn to hang me as a traitor," said Captain Alexander, bitterly.</p> 
               <p>"He is no more," said Welden, solemnly.</p> 
               <p>"Dead! how? when?"</p> 
               <p>"He was one of the victims of that useless and cruel massacre of our brave fellows, which your commander perpetrated two days since in blowing up the stranded vessel. I believe he joined the boats in hopes of capturing you."</p> 
               <p>"I cannot rejoice at such a fate, even for mine enemy," said Charles Alexander, seriously,-"but as for the act of which you speak, believe me there was no intention of causing<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6942-00000025"/> useless slaughter. Captain Barry only meant to destroy the vessel and cargo, and in placing the slow-match merely desired to give his own men time to retire, without thinking of the effect upon you."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to hear it; I love an open fight, but despise an ambush; and I feared it was in retaliation of some supposed outrages our forces have occasionally, to the regret of all honorable men in the service, enacted."</p> 
               <p>The knowledge of Lord R-'s death was certainly a relief to Charles Alexander, especially in relation to his cousin, whom he now became most anxious indeed to communicate with, for he <emph>doubted her not.</emph> His position for the present, however, was imperative.</p> 
               <p>The next morning the atmosphere was thick and foggy, and under the impression that the Roebuck was still aground, Captain Alexander got underweigh at an early hour, thinking he could pass under cover of the fog; he had cleared the mouth of the creek, but at the moment he fancied himself free, the sun burst forth, the fog disappeared; and he found himself <emph>close under the guns of the enemy!</emph> The Roebuck was no longer aground, but lying snugly at anchor watching his motions. A light wind, however accompanied the appearance of the sun, and enabled the Wasp before the frigate could weigh her anchor, to shoot ahead and gain advantage of the breeze. The ship, fearing to be again disappointed of her prey, opened her whole broadside on the active little Wasp, which, fortunately, had no other effect than to check her own headway, and hide the schooner from view in the cloud of smoke that issued from the batten. The chase was continued and a constant fire kept up from her bow guns for nearly an hour; but her shot did little or no damage, and by the help of oars and towing, the schooner gained the protection of the galleys which had during the night changed their position, and were now returning to begin the attack anew.</p> 
               <p>The small calibre of the Wasp's guns prevented her from using her battery in the second sharp engagement between the galleys and the frigates; but her presence turned out most opportunely; for, during the action one of the finest of the gun boats sustained such a heavy loss in men that there were not enough left to mange her, and she was compelled to drop out of line. Barney, who had been watching the conflict with intense interest, immediately sought and obtained permission to volunteer with enough of the schooner's men to bring her again into action, which he did in gallant style, and contributed much to the success of the action, which was long and fierce, but which resulted in the discomfiture of the frigates, which were compelled to retire from the combat, much cut up, and were evidently glad to escape. The galleys followed them to Newcastle, throwing in an occasional long shot, but seeing no chance to come up, they returned.</p> 
               <p>The reception of Captain Alexander in Philadelphia was highly flattering-the gallantry of the Little "Wasp was the general theme, and every honor was awarded to her officers and crew. Alexander received from Congress a Captain's, and Barney a Lieutenant's commission in the navy-the former being transferred to the command of a new ship.</p> 
               <p>Not the least gratifying to him on his return was to learn that his cousin was in Philadelphia, whither she had been brought by her father for medical advice. Charles sought and obtained an interview through the good offices of a mutual friend. Florence, though much shocked at the terrible fate of Lord R--nevertheless experienced a sense of relief from the persecution which had threatened her, and to prevent anything of the kind in future, she quietly accompanied Charles with their mutual friend, and his lady one afternoon to church, where she became his wife, more proud of his love and fame than any fictitious position she could have arrived at.</p> 
               <p>Lieutenant Welden obtained his exchange through Captain Alexander's good offices. Before they separated, he explained briefly the connexion between himself and the late Lord R--</p> 
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6942-00000026"/> 
               <p>He was his lordship's illegitimate brother, and the former having been charged by their brother with his fortunes, took occasion to tyrannize over and proscribe him as much as he dare. The brave sailor returned home, and from choice he engaged no more in the contest with the Colonies.</p> 
               <p>To the romantic reader's imagination I will leave the task of painting Florence's reconciliation with her father, and the prosperity and happiness of the lovers. But for Captain Charles Alexander, his gallant exploits were among the first which established our naval <foreign xml:lang="FRA">prestige,</foreign> and his name deserves an honored place in our Revolutionary History.</p>

               <head>CONSTANCE BEVERLY:</head> 
               <head type="sub">OR, LOVE AND LOYALTY.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A STORY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.</head> 
               <p>"Hear me, Constance! For Heaven's sake listen before you talk of your irrevocable decision."</p> 
               <p>"Listen to a traitor, sir?"</p> 
               <p>"It is a hard name, Constance."</p> 
               <p>"But it is a just one, sir," said the lady, haughtily. "What faith can a woman expect from one who is disloyal to his king? Renounce this purpose, Edward; or, though my heartstrings snap, I will tear you from my thoughts forever! Nay, it is but one word-YES or NO!"</p> 
               <p>"Will you drive me to despair, Constance?" pleaded the youth.</p> 
               <p>"Your answer, Edward," said the excited girl, unheeding his imprecation.</p> 
               <p>There was no sign of relenting in her countenance; and, with an air sorrowful, but proud and determined as her own, Edward Gordon replied:-</p> 
               <p>"Then hear me, Constance Beverly. I have loved you with a true faith; our troth was plighted ere we knew the meaning of the obligation; and my heart has never owned a pulse that was not thine. More: if this purpose holds, its last throb of happiness will have passed, and the sense of duty alone will remain to guide and animate me as I press on to my only goal-the grave; but, so sacred do I hold the cause<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6942-00000027"/> I would espouse, that I will sacrifice to it even the bliss of calling you mine. You term me traitor; but, if my deeds fulfil half the promise of my ambition, generations to come shall bless me as a PATRIOT! You bid me despair, and a sad echo in my own bosom repeats the word with melancholy emphasis; but my despair shall be a noble one, and in the cause of Freedom, on some well-fought and victorious battle-field, it will be my ardent wish to breathe out the life whose fondest hopes you have blighted!"</p> 
               <p>And, seizing the hand of his beloved mistress, Edward Gordon gazed for a moment on her face, which relaxed not in its stern determination; pressing his cold lips upon that colder hand, he turned sadly away, and departed slowly, as if, even against hope, he expected a recall; but she gave no sign of relenting-that proud high spirited girl-though mortal agony was at her heartstrings, and the wail of lost happiness made saddest music in her breast.</p> 
               <p>The condition of the parties thus introduced to the reader may be briefly explained. Constance Beverly and Edward Gordon were the only children of wealthy and aristocratic Virginia families; and their marriage had been a matter of friendly arrangement almost from their cradles. Happily, inclination approved what interest or policy had 'dictated, Brought up in close intimacy, Love, the trust and best, that which springs from affection and esteem, had twined itself around every fibre of their hearts. Constance, though possessed of quick temper and high spirit, was also of a noble and generous disposition; while Edward, with his warm and ardent soul, was distinguished by that finest trait of manly character, calm and dignified self-possession: so that their differences of opinion never led to a serious misunderstanding; for a point urged too far by the vehemence of the one, was invariably met firmly but kindly by the other; and the generous girl, forced to admire and respect the opinions of her lover, yielded with grace to one whose affection, unruffled by trifles, was ever a sure haven of repose to her spirit. Powerful, then, must have been the reason which could shake the reliance of Constance Beverly in the judgement of Edward Gordon, and induce her to pronounce the irrevocable fiat which she deemed was to separate them for ever.</p> 
               <p>Such, alas! have been the results of civil discord since the first formation of society-the disruption of social ties, desolation and misery! Nor was the American revolution an exception to the rule.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Beverly, the father of Constance, was a royalist of uncompromising principles; and though, as the immediate descendant of an illustrious cavalier, he had no hereditary partiality for the House of Hanover, he still regarded resistance to the royal authority as the rankest treason. On the other hand, General Gordon, coming of a Scotch Covenanter family, had much more liberal notions of the right in the people to resist tyranny; and although political differences had never marred their social intercourse, or lessened their friendship, yet, as men of strong minds generally do, they had educated their children each in his own peculiar views, and imbued them with their respective sentiments. Even the outbreak of the American revolution, notwithstanding their opposite ideas of the right and justice of that struggle, had caused no difference between them, from reasons which it is not necessary to the purpose of our narrative to enumerate, were destined to be active participants in the contest.</p> 
               <p>It was only when Edward Gordon, after long reflection, and under a deep sense of patriotic duty, announced his intention to join the defenders of his native land, that Colonel Beverly, first endeavoring earnestly, but vainly, to turn him from his purpose, declared that his daughter <emph>never should marry a rebel.</emph> The more cool-headed Presbyterian tried hard to combat his determination, and only gave up after a heated argument, in which even these old and devoted friends well nigh quarrelled.</p> 
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6942-00000028"/> 
               <p>"You must e'en make a mistress of your country, lad," said his father to Edward, who had waited with anxiety the result of the interview, "the ould stubborn royalist canna be moved by any arguments of mine."</p> 
               <p>"But Constance, sir."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, see the lassie yourself, if ye will; but I doubt you will find her more reasonable than her sire."</p> 
               <p>And strange to say, so deeply did Constance Beverly share in the opinions of her father, that she acquiesced in his decision, with the proviso that she were permitted to make one appeal to Edward herself. The result of the interview, in which every persuasion, and argument which love and loyalty could suggest had been vainly tried to turn the young patriot from his duty, we have just seen. And it is but justice to Constance to say that her heart bled freely as that of her lover under the constraint which "pride, and an imaginary sense of duty, had placed upon her.</p> 
               <p>Months rolled on, and nothing was heard at Beverly Park of Edward Gordon, as the intimacy between the families had been broken up. It is true the two old gentleman greeted each other with formal politeness when they met; but it was an interchange of mere ceremony and nothing else. In the mean time however Colonel Beverly could but perceive that care, however bravely concealed, was making sad inroads upon the health of his beloved child. To counteract its effects he endeavored to surround her with as much gayety as possible, and for that purpose exercised even more than his customary hospitality, filling his house with the most agreeable guests he could find. A detachment of the British army was quartered in the neighborhood, and the officers found a welcome at Beverly Park which they were by no means slow to avail themselves of. Good cheer, an agreeable host, and a beautiful, though cold and proud daughter, were attractions the gallant military were not likely to slight. General Gordon, after seeing Edward in an honorable position tion, had placed a trustworthy agent over his estates, and left America for a visit to Scotland.</p> 
               <p>Among the gay and brilliant throng who surrounded Constance Beverly, and paid court to her beauty, and her wealth, there were few, or none, who could awake even a passing sympathy in her heart. If hope had died, yet the sacred memories of the past were there inurned! Yet many a brave and gallant cavalier strove hard for the prize; and at last came one who in all the world's externals was pre-eminently endowed to win a woman's heart. Birth, fortune, and appearance were all in favor of Algernon Beaufort; he was young, handsome, and gifted, with a brilliant reputation both in society and his profession. It is true he had been called a "flirt," but there could be no doubt of his sincerity now; and with all the art which nature had given, and education refined and cultivated, did he apply himself to win the "cold, proud Constance Beverly."</p> 
               <p>Colonel Beverly had looked with something like indifference on the other suitors who wooed his daughter's favor: his object was to wean her from destroying care and unhappiness, and he would have been well content if any proper match could have been made, though so far he had regarded no particular one of them with favor. It was now different, and the parent could scarcely conceal his anxiety that the elegant and high-born Colonel Beaufort should find favor in his child's eyes. Alas! how completely age forgets the feelings of youth. Constance noticed the change in her father with much concern; and though she treated her suitor with marked respect, she endeavored as far as possible to check any hopes he might entertain of a warmer interest; with the earnest desire that matters might not come to a crisis which would bring her in conflict with paternal authority. Beaufort perceived her intent, and, as a careful and wary hunter, forbore to alarm the object of his pursuit. He had however fixed on her hand<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6942-00000029"/> and fortune as a prize worth winning, and the idea of ultimate failure never for one moment troubled his thoughts.</p> 
               <p>The intimacy of Colonel Beaufort with Colonel Beverly had existed for over a year, and yet the former had made no positive proposal to either father or daughter, though he was sufficiently assiduous in his attentions to keep others aloof. In fact, he had managed to quiet Constance's apprehension, by a stratagem worthy of his skill; after one or two attempts at gallantry, which had been foiled by her very decided manner, he had seemed to give up all hopes or pretensions, and sought merely to deserve her friendship, which, with a feeling almost amounting to gratitude, she was nearly ready to bestow. Duty had frequently called Colonel Beaufort away, and about eighteen months after his first introduction at Beverly Park, he learned that he would probably be ordered to the North. He now deemed the time ripe for an explanation; and after a long interview with Colonel Beverly, wherein matters which will be revealed hereafter, were discussed, he demanded the hand of his daughter, and to his great gratification received the parents' sanction to his suit.</p> 
               <p>"If you will permit me, my dear Colonel," said Beaufort, "I think it were as well that you broke the matter to Miss Beverly, before I plead my own case."</p> 
               <p>"Right, sir, very right," replied the old gentleman, "I will see Constance at once and prepare her for your reception."</p> 
               <p>"And you will not fail to lay before her the great and mutual advantages of an alliance, my dear Colonel?"</p> 
               <p>"I shall forget nothing, sir; but, trust me, your lover-doubts are superfluous-Constance is a dutiful daughter, even were the match less pleasing to her than I trust it will prove."</p> 
               <p>The announcement came on Constance Beverly like a shock. She had been artfully led to trust Beaufort as a friend, and to put off all apprehensions of him as a lover. It is true that her father's partiality for him gave her from time to time some uneasiness; but so long as she deemed the suitor himself satisfied fied that she could not accept him, and willing to forego his pretensions, she felt comparative safety; but his duplicity now alarmed her as much as her father's earnestness in favor of the match.</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me, oh! forgive me, my dear father; but I cannot marry Colonel Beaufort."</p> 
               <p>"And why not, Constance? Is there any personal objection to him? Methinks his is a form to please a maiden's fancy; a high-bred gentleman, a brave and honorable soldier. What, fault can you find in such a choice for your husband?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh! none, dear father-no fault; but, I cannot marry. Alas! I cannot forget-"</p> 
               <p>"Wilful, false girl! I understand you," exclaimed the old man, "you still cling to the base rebel's memory. But never, never may you see him again. Nay, listen to me; this marriage with Colonel Beaufort is one of more than ordinary import. There is a title, an earldom in abeyance: it has long been a matter of dispute between our families, for we are nearly related, and this union would harmonize all conflicting interests, and his services and my loyalty in this unnatural contest, would perhaps be sufficient to cause it to be revived in his person, and continued to my descendants. Do you see, girl, what vast interests your obstinacy might destroy?"</p> 
               <p>"But, father, I do not love this man."</p> 
               <p>"And what gratitude has love brought you? Was your love strong enough to keep Edward Gordon in the path of duty? Did he not desert you for the rebel's camp, despite of all your love? And would you have him think, that you pined away for <emph>his</emph> love-the daughter of Robert Beverly? Constance, this marriage <emph>must take place.</emph> Pride, interest self-respect, all urge it."</p> 
               <p>Oh! how bitter to the heart of Constance Beverly were the taunts uttered by her father. She could only bow her head in brokenness of spirit, as he proceeded more kindly-</p> 
               <p>"Come, my daughter, there is an antidote for the past in a<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6942-00000030"/> brilliant and happy future, which, as the wife of Colonel Beaufort, you will enjoy. Receive him, therefore, as your affianced husband, unless you would condemn your old doting father to go down to the grave sorrowing over the disobedience and recusancy of his only child."</p> 
               <p>Oh! hard indeed are the trials of the heart, and poor Constance Beverly was condemned to their severest ordeal. She had never known-she never could know another love than that for Edward Gordon, and even though he had forgotten her, or learned to despise her faithlessness, she felt that it was a part of her destiny to cherish this passion through life; its sorrows a penance for sacrificing the happiness of both to a mere sentiment of loyalty. Yes! Constance saw with a clearer vision now. But, then, her father-her hitherto fond, indulgent father. She knew too well the character of his sentiments, and the violence of his disposition, not to feel that her disobedience might have a serious effect upon him; perhaps, indeed, compromise his health and send him sorrowing to the tomb. Alas! what could the wretched Constance do?</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Edward, my first and only love! the last prayer of poor Constance will be for your happiness; and if I take this hated step to save a parent's life, forgive me! and believe that my heart, still faithful, will at last break in the effort, and my spirit, purified by the filial sacrifice, will go up to await thine own-breathed forth, as thou didst prophecy, from a hero's death-bed of glory!"</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Two weeks after the interview with her father, Constance Beverly stood at the altar ready to take the vows which would make her the bride of Algernon Beaufort.</p> 
               <p>The reasons for such haste were these: Colonel Beaufort had been ordered to the north, and as it had been determined that Colonel Beverly should visit England after the marriage, he intended to accompany them thus far on his way, and after seeing his daughter fixed in a suitable home, would proceed on his ambitious project about the earldom.</p> 
               <p>The company assembled was neither so numerous nor brilliant as might have been expected, for the ceremony had been deferred to the last moment, in compliance with the wishes of Constance, and Colonel Beaufort's regiment had already departed, leaving only a small guard with which it was his intention to follow at such speed as might suit the comfort of his bride to the port of embarkation. The hour was seven in the morning, and the mist still shrouded the valleys, though the hill tops were gilded with sun light; a substantial breakfast had been prepared for the travellers, that, after the ceremony, they might enjoy a good meal before setting out on their journey.</p> 
               <p>"What on earth can delay Parson Dale so?" observed Colonel Beverly, testily. "He promised to be with us by half-past six, and here is seven o'clock."</p> 
               <p>"He is lost in the fog, perhaps, or captured by the cowboys," observed Colonel Beaufort, with a faint attempt at pleasantry. He looked exceedingly dull and nervous for a man about to become a happy bridegroom.</p> 
               <p>"John," said Colonel Beverly, addressing a servant in attendance, "mount one of the horses, and ride towards Parson Dale's, and tell him, if you meet him, that we are waiting his pleasure. Be seated, my friends; we cannot have much longer to wait."</p> 
               <p>Even this respite seemed a blessed one to poor Constance, whose features cold and rigid as though nerved to a task which required all her strength-avoiding, as much as possible, the officious attentions of him who was about to become her husband. She took a seat on a sofa beside an old lady who had been a friend of her mother.</p> 
               <p>In less than five minutes the servant who had been sent for the person returned with a wild, affrighted look.</p> 
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6942-00000031"/> 
               <p>"Why, what in the world is the matter with you, John?" demanded Colonel Beverly, rising.</p> 
               <p>"Dey's cumin, massa! da! da! Don't you hear urn?"</p> 
               <p>Sure enough, straggling shots were heard, which grew louder and quicker each instant.</p> 
               <p>"The rebels! to horse! I must to horse!" exclaimed Colonel Beaufort, as with a half apology he hurried from the room to join his troops.</p> 
               <p>"Father-dear father! you shall not go!" exclaimed Constance, twining her arms round her parent as he, too, with the brave spirit of an old soldier, was hastening to join in the fray.</p> 
               <p>"Let me pass, Constance, I must. The base rebels, to attack my peaceful residence."</p> 
               <p>When Colonel Beverly arrived at the front door, however, a sight presented itself which at once turned his thoughts to the safety of those within. Beaufort had joined his men, about twenty in number, and was maintaining a desperate, but apparently hopeless contest, with the yard fence as a sort of barricade, against a force about three or four times his number, who had fairly encompassed the house and its defenders.</p> 
               <p>"To the house! fall back into the house, Colonel Beaufort! We can make a better defence!" exclaimed Colonel Beverly.</p> 
               <p>This indeed seemed the most sensible plan, and Beaufort, Who had the quick eye of an able commander, immediately availed himself of it by firing a volley, and making a quick retreat under cover of it, which he effected with the loss of only three men. The doors and windows were soon barricaded, and preparations were hurriedly made for standing a siege. The American forces, which consisted of irregular troops, numbering near one hundred, under the command of a noted partizan leader, made equally rapid demonstrations of assault. Their commanded, however, displaying a flag of trace, demanded a parley, and asked the unconditional surrender of the enemy.</p> 
                
               <p>"Never!" replied Colonel Beaufort; "We will defend this house with our lives. My regiment is not far off, and will be down upon you, rogues, before you can gain one inch."</p> 
               <p>"Ha, ha! noble Colonel; we know all about your movements; your regiment is fifty miles off; and we intent to have you and your men, dead or alive; so the less trouble you give us the better. And as for the old tory Beverly, he may thank his stars if he gets off with a little plunder."</p> 
               <p>In two minutes after this parley the attack and defence commenced, and was sustained gallantly on both sides. The ladies had been conveyed to the cellar; the greater portion of the troops occupied the upper story, from whence they could fire on the assailants, under the command of Colonel Beaufort, while the rest, and the guests were on the first floor, ready, under the direction of Colonel Beverly, to resist any attempt to force an entrance. After about a half an hour's hard fighting Colonel Beaufort descended to the parlor for consultation.</p> 
               <p>"Colonel Beverly," said he gravely, "I regret to say that I fear the further defence of your house has become impracticable. We would cheerfully give up our lives, but it can avail you nothing."</p> 
               <p>"How, sir, is there any new danger? I thought you were keeping the rebels bravely at bay."</p> 
               <p>"They have already picked off four of my best men-they have combustible arrows with them, and have set fire to the north end of the house; and a man whom I have sent to the upper story to look out, reports a much larger rebel force approaching, not half a mile off."</p> 
               <p>"It is indeed, terrible; what shall we do?"</p> 
               <p>"SURRENDER! and save your lives," said a deep voice close by, and to their utter consternation an officer of the Continental uniform stood before them, in the calm triumph of a victor.</p> 
               <p>"Ha! whence came you? who are you? Rebel, die!"<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6942-00000032"/> shouted Beaufort, as, perceiving the intruder was alone, he advanced sword in hand upon him.</p> 
               <p>To snatch a pistol from his belt, and level it full at the head of the British officer, with a smile of defiance, was for the American the act of an instant. An interruption fully as potent, however, as the weapon was interposed. Constance, whose anxiety for her father's safety had induced to leave the place of security, arrived at that moment, and with one rapid glance at the state of affairs, threw herself into the arms of the stranger, exclaiming;</p> 
               <p>"Edward! dear Edward! you have come to save us!"</p> 
               <p>"If it is in my power, Constance," and transferring her gently to the arms of her father, for, in the ecstacy of what seemed unexpected, and unhoped relief from all her troubles, the poor girl had fainted, he addressed the British commander:</p> 
               <p>"Let there be a truce between us, sir. I am alone, and the means by which I entered are unknown to your assailants; but, as you have already surmised, your only safety is in a surrender; my troop is approaching, and must of course, take part in the conflict, unless you avoid the necessity by a timely surrender. Display a white flag, permit me to depart at once, and I will cause an immediate cessation of hostilities, and obtain you the most favorable terms possible, although the leader of the party who besiege you holds an independent command."</p> 
               <p>There was an appearance of doubt on the countenance of Colonel Beanfort.</p> 
               <p>"Colonel Beverly knows me well, and will at least vouch for my honor," said Edward, "I would save him and his family from further annoyance."</p> 
               <p>"It is Mr. Gordon," said Colonel Beverly, who was still busied with his daughter, "yes, you had better do as he say."</p> 
               <p>"Go, sir, I trust you as an officer and a gentleman; I will do as you say."</p> 
                
               <p>A parley was instantly effected, and Colonels Beaufort and Beverly presented themselves at a lower window, to arrange the terms of a surrender with the partizan leader, who very cheerfully deferred to Major Gordon, as his superior. At this moment, one of those unfortunate and lamentable incidents occurred, which so often throw unmerited odium upon the most honorable intentions, and are not unfrequently followed by the most direful results. A shot was fired from the assailants, and Colonel Beverly, placing his hand on his side said,</p> 
               <p>"I am hit," and sank to the floor.</p> 
               <p>"Treachery!" exclaimed Beaufort, as he sprang back to close the window.</p> 
               <p>"Hold! it is punished!" shouted the stentorian voice of the partizan leader, as the report of his pistol rang upon the air; and the miscreant, who was some fifteen paces off, fell a corpse. The man had been a secret enemy of Colonel Beverly, and taken this mode of revenge.</p> 
               <p>"Colonel Beaufort," said Edward Gordon, "Captain Horton's force will at once withdraw, my own troop will move up, and you will surrender as prisoners of war to me-Major Gordon, of the American Continental forces. This is a sad affair, and must be looked to." While speaking, Edward had already approached, and bent over Colonel Beverly.</p> 
               <p>"Let it be so, then," said Beaufort.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Beverly was conveyed carefully to a sofa, and a surgeon, who accompanied Major Gordon's command, was quickly in attendance. The wound, however, was fatal, and he uttered but a few words: "My daughter! Constance-where?"</p> 
               <p>The poor girl had gone to convey the welcome news of safety to her companions, and returned, alas! just in time to catch her parent's parting breath, and to hear his last blessing, coupled with an indistinct murmur about carrying out his wishes. Poor, unhappy Constance! *   *   *   *</p> 
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6942-00000033"/> 
               <p>Three years had passed, and great events had transpired. The colonies, after a long and arduous struggle, had well nigh achieved their independence. The French and American forces held Lord Cornwallis shut up in Yorktown, where the last grand act of Freedom's drama was about to be played. During the time which had intervened, Constance Beverly had resided with a relative of her father. Colonel Beaufort had renewed his suit again and again; but constance still rejected him; she had made a compromise with her conscience, and if her own peace of mind forbade her to obey what she believed to be the wishes of her father in one respect, she resolved not to disobey him in another <emph>She had not seen Edward Gordon since the fatal day of Colonel Beverly's death.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>The relation with whom Constance had resided was a royalist, and had determined, as the cause to which he was devoted waned, to retire to England; and Constance felt it her duty to accompany his family; in fact, they were already in Yorktown, where Constance was subjected again, unfortunately, to the importunities of Colonel Beaufort.</p> 
               <p>Edward Gordon, who was with the army under Washington, and who had learned Constance's determination, took advantage of a flag of truce to convey her a letter, beseeching her, in terms she could not resist, at least to grant him one interview before they were parted forever. The devoted girl could not deny her lover's entreaties, and having, through a large bribe, obtained the assistance of an old Sergeant with whose wife she had some dealings, was enabled to appoint him a rendezvous for the following evening, at a grove outside of the fortifications, but as it proved, within the British lines.</p> 
               <p>The impatience of the lover carried him to the appointed place of meeting at least half an hour before the time; and what was his astonishment and dismay to find himself suddenly pinioned from behind, and borne off to the city a prisoner er. As they neared the gates they were met by three persons, a male and two females, muffled.</p> 
               <p>"Who have you there, comrades?" asked the former.</p> 
               <p>"A bloody spy; we have just caught him; won't he swing for it?"</p> 
               <p>"Hist! lady," said the old Sergeant; "We can do no good here; let us follow."</p> 
               <p>Half fainting, and supported by her really kind companions, Constance was borne back to her home. Through what a night of suspense and agony did she pass! The next morning brought news enough. An American officer, it was said, high in the confidence of Washington, had been detected as a spy, would in a few hours be tried as a spy, and doubtless hung as a spy. Never had the cup of misery seemed full to Constance Beverly until now; but in our darkest hours a gleam of light sometimes comes as an inspiration from Heaven. Almost intuitively Constance divined the author of this plot-for plot she felt sure it was. Colonel Beaufort had never forgotten the scene at Beverly Park, and more than once had let fall words of enmity and jealousy against Major Gordon, which gave Constance to understand that he would willingly injure him if he could. From Beaufort's hand, then, came the dart; he had learned, somehow, their intended meeting, and prepared the trap. So reasoned constance, and she was not far from right. But alas! what should she do-how shield Edward? All was confusion doubt and terror in her mind; at one moment she should to go Lord Cornwallis and ask his intercession, his mercy; then she would appeal to Beaufort, offer him anything, her wealth, her claims to the Earldom-all but her hand-to release her lover. The morning wore apace in an agony of suspense, and still the Sergeant came not, though she was so anxiously waiting his news. At last there was a knock at the door a step in the entry, a form entered the room-it was Colonel Beaufort who stood beside her!.</p> 
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6942-00000034"/> 
               <p>"Miss Beverly, you doubtless divine the object of my visit; and as my time is brief, you will excuse ceremony. I was a suitor for your hand, your father granted it to me, and by every law of honor, every moral obligation, it should be mine. An unfortunate interruption prevented the consummation of our marriage; your brave father fell by the hands of a rebel; and, since then, you have persistently refused to ratify your engagement, to keep your faith with me. I am not so verdant as not to have perceived the reason, nor so tame of spirit as to endure it quietly. I have watched my opportunity, and am at last triumphant. My rival is in my power; you love him; well, before the sun passes the meridian, you are my wife, or he is hung as a spy. Your choice!"</p> 
               <p>"You cannot be so cruel! You know he is no spy."</p> 
               <p>"The law has already adjudged him one."</p> 
               <p>"But I will go to Lord Cornwallis-I will tell him all," exclaimed Constance, almost frantic.</p> 
               <p>"Too late, madam, his lordship will not return from the fortifications until after the execution. It rests with me alone to delay or expedite his face. Now, your choice!"</p> 
               <p>"Alas! is there no hope?'</p> 
               <p>"But one."</p> 
               <p>At this instant, the speaker was interrupted by a big, fat Irish woman, the Sergeant's wife, who casting a black look at him as she entered, thrust a small note in Constance's hand, exclaiming-</p> 
               <p>"Shure an' it guv me trouble enough; but I'd work the flesh off me bones to serve ye, darlint!"</p> 
               <p>It was a note from Edward, and ran thus:</p>

               <p>"There, sir," exclaimed Constance, drawing herself up proudly, "is your answer. Biddy, show Colonel Beaufort the door."</p> 
               <p>"And mine shall be delivered by the hands of the hangman!" was the bitter retort.</p> 
               <p>Fearful was the suspense in which he left the unhappy girl.</p> 
               <p>'Oh! Biddy, Biddy! what shall I do?"</p> 
               <p>"An' shure, why don't ye go to his lordship; he sets a heap of store by you, and would just let the nice young gentleman out in a twinkling, av you was to ax it.'</p> 
               <p>"But they say I cannot see him, Biddy."</p> 
               <p>"And why not, to be shure? But see! faix, and yonder he comes, Holy Virgin be praised, right this way,"exclaimed Biddy.</p> 
               <p>It was true. Having been a friend of her father, Lord Cornwallis had treated Constance with much kindness and attention during her sojourn at Yorktown, and his morning inspection of the fortifications being over, was coming to make her a call.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! my lord, you have come at a happy moment for poor Constance." She exclaimed, as soon as he entered, at the same time bursting into tears.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Beverly!" said the kind-hearted nobleman, "this strange agitation-tell me-tell me at once, what is the matter, young lady? I am your friend-was your father's friend."</p> 
               <p>In rapid and scarce coherent language, she poured out the<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6942-00000035"/> story of her sufferings, and besought his intervention-his mercy.</p> 
               <p>"This is awkward; taken inside out lines-in disguise, doubtless-an officer too of rank. The fate of poor Andre has made our people eager for revenge. I may have trouble."</p> 
               <p>"But, my lord, I assure you he is no spy. He came at my invitation to bid me one sad farewell before we parted forever. You surely will not suffer him to be murdered?"</p> 
               <p>"No, no! that must not be; but I must hurry. I know Algernon Beaufort but too well. Heaven favors you, young lady," he exclaimed suddenly, "there is an orderly with my horse. Farewell, or rather <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au revoir.</foreign> Have no fears, you shall soon hear from me."</p> 
               <p>The agony of fear was over, and constance sank exhausted on a sofa. The kindness of Biddy was unremitting, and only equalled by her volubility. In about half an hour the sergeant came with news of how Colonel Beaufort had arrived in a great passion, and ordered the execution to proceed immediately; and how just as the prisoner was being brought out, his "lordship" had ridden up looking so grand like, and countermanded the orders, directing the "young gintleman" to be taken to his own quarters. In an hour more a carriage arrived with a polite request from Lord Cornwallis that Miss Beverly would honor him with a visit.</p> 
               <p>Constance found the British commander in company with her relative only, as she tremblingly entered. He took her hand kindly and said-</p> 
               <p>"I have been so fortunate as to release your friend, dear Miss Beverly. He shall be liberated on parole within the limits of the city; but if I free him from one thraldom I must subject him to another, and require your personal security."</p> 
               <p>"With all my heart, my lord; lands, property, everything will I pledge for Major Gordon's honor."</p> 
               <p>Lord Cornwallis smiled a peculiar smile. "You do not seem to understand me, my dear young lady; and as my time is precious, I must be brief. Your worthy relative here, and I have talked the matter over; you are sacrificing life's happiness, perhaps, to a false notion. Had your noble-minded father been aware, as I am, of Colonel Beaufort's true character he would never have urged your union with him, and as for his late prejudices against Major Gordon, my own discomfiture which is, alas! too probable, will be the triumph of the Continental cause, and convert the rebel into a hero."</p> 
               <p>Constance stood as one bewildered.</p> 
               <p>"Come, your relative consents, and I would fain leave one grateful memory behind me, in a land which, although kindred, I fear me will long curse the British name, e'er your great rebel chief drives me forth, as I bitterly foresee he must."</p> 
               <p>Still Constance was silent.</p> 
               <p>"I had forgotten," said Cornwallis quickly. "I must summon a more powerful advocate."</p> 
               <p>He touched a bell, a folding door flew open, and Edward Gordon caught the blushing girl in his arms.</p>

               <p>The battle of Yorktown was over. Algernon Beaufort fell fighting gallantly, a fate which even those he had sought to injure could not rejoice over. The defeat which he had foreseen and predicted, overtook the brave and generous, but unfortunate Lord Cornwallis, who left, perhaps, the purest reputation of any British commander in the war, and more than one grateful heart to remember kindness at his hands. General Washington himself, when he heard of his conduct towards Major Gordon, a favorite officer, testified his thanks in a personal interview.</p>

               <head>THE SEA CHASE.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A REVOLUTIONARY REMINISCENCE.</head> 
               <p>THERE is no excitement more intense than that of a sea chase! With the broad and trackless ocean before you, and a gallant bark bounding beneath you; whether pursuit or flight be the object, your emotions are excited, and your senses quickened, into a life far more vivid than any stimulus of the "dull tame shore" can excite; upon the qualities of your vessel, or the skill with which she is managed, turns the question of triumph or defeat-life or death; with what eagerness, then, do you mark each trifling indication, each shift of wind, each effect of wave or current-with what assiduity you avail yourself of favorable, or seek to avoid unfavorable, changes; the eye grows quicker, the brain more active, and hand and heart contribute to success!</p> 
               <p>Never perhaps was the interest of a sea-chase more warmly felt than on board an armed sloop, which was bowling along, one bright summer morning in the year 1777, in the latitude of the Bermudas. The graceful little craft was in the service of the American Colonies, which were carrying on a gallant struggle against the gigantic power of Great Britain, whose fleets swarmed the ocean, while the gallant little navy of our embryo Republic scarce ranked as an organized force. Not withstanding a disparity, however, which put all comparison of strength ridiculously out of the question, the American vessels, slipping quietly out to sea, in defiance of their foes, occasionally performed deeds of almost incredible heroism, and scattered terror and confusion among the commerce of the enemy. Among these, none, at that early day, had played a more conspicuous part than the little craft just mentioned, and no one of those heroes whose deeds of daring on the ocean have left a deathless name, was destined to be wider known to fame than her commander. He was a man about the middle height, but of those admirable proportions which denote both strength and agility; his eagle eye, the haughty curl of the lip, and his free, proud step, bespoke a lofty will and an unconquerable determination. As he moved along the deck, occasionally glancing aloft, then casting his eyes on the far off distant horizon, and anon losing himself in a reverie, every eye was turned upon him in that admiration which a sailor always feels for superior genius and skill, for he was a man to whom others soon learned to look as one to be relied on in every emergency.</p> 
               <p>No one had yet ventured to disturb the captain's morning promenade-not even the officer of the deck, who was quietly gazing over the bulwarks at the bright sea and azure skies. Suddenly the former paused, bent an intense gaze on the horizon, and turning quickly said-</p> 
               <p>"How is this Mr. Olney, no sail has been reported to me?"</p> 
               <p>The reply of the Lieutenant was cut short by the look-out at the masthead, who sang out in a clear, shrill voice that spirit-stirring cry,</p> 
               <p>"Sail, ho!"</p> 
               <p>"Where away?" shouted the officer of the deck.</p> 
               <p>'Broad on the weather-bow," was the reply.</p> 
               <p>"The look-out reports a sail broad on the weather-bow," said the Lieutenant, touching his cap formally. "It is the first which has been made out this morning."</p> 
               <p>"If he had said three sail, he would have come nearer," replied the commander, quietly, at the same time applying a spy-glass to his eye.</p> 
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6942-00000037"/> 
               <p>"Shall I order the man down, sir," asked the officer of the watch.</p> 
               <p>"No, no, his eyes are as quick as common, I believe; but few men discern a sail aloft sooner than I do from deck. Haul to the wind, sir, and give chase. In the meantime, I will try and make out what they are." So saying, the captain slung a telescope around his neck, and mounted lightly to the masthead. It was, perhaps, half an hour before he came down. In the meantime, the chase had become plainly visible from the deck.</p> 
               <p>"They are running with the wind free-running right across our bows, and cannot have made us out yet. I should judge they were merchantmen; so keep you luff, sir, and we may yet chance to carry a good prize into port."</p> 
               <p>In half an hour more the sloop had so nearly closed with the chase as to make them out. The unerring eye of the Commodore was the first to distinguish their character.</p> 
               <p>"Two of them are merchantmen, and the third I take for an armed transport. Hoist our flag, Mr. Olney," said he, getting down from the rigging, which he had once more ascended.</p> 
               <p>"See! sir, what is that?" remarked the lieutenant, calling the captain's attention, which had been momentarily with-drawn.</p> 
               <p>"Ha! the two merchantmen are hauling their wind; the transport still holds on; the lubberly monster still shows fight, ha? <emph>He shall have it!</emph> 
                  <unclear>Up</unclear> with our ensign, sir, and keep well to win'ard; we must <unclear>have</unclear> the weather guage, if possible; it will go hard if we cannot cripple him at 'long' tom,' before his pop guns do us much damage."</p> 
               <p>Almost with the command, there rose to the peak of the sloop a roll of bunting, which, when unfolded to the breeze, displayed the gorgeous blazonry of stripes which now form the ground of our National banner; but instead of the azure field of stars, in the centre there was a serpent, in the act of striking, with the motto, "Don't tread on me." Such was the first flag of the colonies which floated over the ocean!</p> 
               <p>The transport, which appeared only to mount a few spar deck guns, was fast closing with the sloop; and with seeming confidence in her own strength, steered directly for her opponent, without due regard for preserving that weatherly position deemed so important in a naval conflict, and for which the American commander was manuvering. Satisfied as to his adversary's intentions, and seeing that he appeared over-confident of his superiority, the American became still more anxious for the weather-guage, which would allow him to choose his own position, and avoid being run aboard, as he had no doubt it was the intention of the British ship to do; with this view, he kept edging to windward, on the same tack. Just as he thought, however, it was time to change his course, a favorable shift of wind gave him a still greater advantage; and, putting his sloop about, he reached far to windward of his adversary. This manuver was evidently as much mistaken on board the English ship, as it will appear her character had been by the American.</p> 
               <p>"Ha! the rebel has made us out," exclaimed the British Captain. "Well, we have him, by G-d! There is not a sloop in the colonies can hold her own with our frigate on a wind, though it was shrewdly calculated on by the Yankee. Up with your flag, and down with your ports, we'll blow him our of water, unless he yields at once."</p> 
               <p>"Surely sir," said the officer to whom the orders were addressed, and who had been closely examining the sloop through his glass, "that is the very chap we are after!"</p> 
               <p>"What!--? Not a gun there-he shall surrender to the very show of the authority he? so insolently defies-the rebel! the traitor! the d-d pirate!'</p> 
               <p>The frigate, whose character became at once apparent, as her numerous port-holes flew open, and a frowning battery<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6942-00000038"/> protruded from her sides, was quickly hauled by the wind, and then commenced one of those contests which, for the actors, crowd the emotions of a lifetime into a few hours.</p> 
               <p>"You have given us warning a little too quick, John Bull," exclaimed the captain of the American vessel, "and you must have the fleetest frigate in his Majesty's navy, if you think to overhaul my bonny little craft."</p> 
               <p>For the first hour every expedient which seamanship could suggest, was used to increase the speed of the vessels; and, to his utter astonishment, the American found that the Briton had evidently the heels of him, and in their present mode of sailing, a few hours more would render his capture inevitable. He was a man, however, of infinite resources, and iron nerve.</p> 
               <p>"Throw the log, Mr. Olney, we are certainly doing well; and yet, yonder craft is overhauling us in a manner that smacks of an English prison."</p> 
               <p>The order was promptly obeyed, and the result reported.</p> 
               <p>"Six knots, on a taut bowline, in this breeze.-Yonder frigate is the fastest that ever carried King George's bunting."</p> 
               <p>"I have heard, sir," said Lieutenant Olney, "that the Solebay, on a wind, is as fleet and almost as weatherly as the fastest schooner."</p> 
               <p>"Then it is she, and in our present position we are no match for her, Olney. I know what prejudices there are against my name among our enemies, and when I entered the service of the Colonies I swore never to be taken alive! I would not wantonly sacrifice the lives of my crew, yet I think I could baffle yon haughty Briton yet, though the risk is fearful."</p> 
               <p>"Give the word, sir, and there's not a man will flinch if they blow us out of water the first broadside," answered the young man enthusiastically.</p> 
               <p>"Well said, my brave fellow. The Colonies could not spare such spirits to rot in an English dungeon, while the glorious battle of Liberty goes on! Now for work; station hands at the peak halyards, let them stand by to lower the peak, and case off the boom of the mainsail; keep the jib sheet fast until we pay off; let everything be done quietly and in order."</p> 
               <p>Bold and desperate indeed was the manuvre which these orders indicated; but prompt and unquestioning obedience was the discipline on board the sloop, so that they were obeyed without confusion. The gallant hero who held the destinies of that faithful crew in his hands was never known to blanch or waver when a purpose was once formed, and his spirit had infused itself into those under him; they knew and trusted him! Having seen everything arranged as he directed, the American captain now took his station by the helmsman. At this moment the frigate had come up in musket range, but not a shot was fired, the royal commander was sure of his prey, and was watching her as a hawk might a partridge.</p> 
               <p>"We'll carry the d-d traitor to London in irons, and show him in a cage," said he to his subordinate. "He can't hold out much longer, for we are coming up hand over fist. Oh! see! he gives it up; he has dropped his peak, and comes up under our lee to surrender. Have a boat's crew ready to take possession, sir."</p> 
               <p>"But see; he has not lowered his flag, sir," replied the Lieutenant.</p> 
               <p>"He has fouled his halyards, perhaps," said the confident commander. "Haul up the courses and lay the main-top-sail to the mast; have your boat ready for lowering."</p> 
               <p>These orders were obeyed, and the sloop, in the meantime, on board which the manuvre described by the British captain had been silently performed, was running free, and was already abreast under the frowning battery of the frigate; her intention was evident; and seizing a trumpet, the English hailed:</p> 
               <p>"Heave to! and send your boat on board."</p> 
               <p>A wave of the hand was the only reply from the commander<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6942-00000039"/> mander of the sloop, while his crew were hauling and tugging with all apparent earnestness to haul in the boom of the mainsail, and hoist the peak, steps indispensable to bring the sloop to the wind.</p> 
               <p>"Why don't you haul down that d-d rebel flag?" shouted the British captain.</p> 
               <p>"It's got fast aloft and can't come down," replied the American.</p> 
               <p>"Very well, heave to! heave to!"</p> 
               <p>The peak of the sloop gradually rose to its proper elevation, giving the full expanse of the sail to the wind, but the boom was as obstinate as the flag, the result of which was that the sloop went off with renewed speed before the wind. For some moments any ruse was unsuspected by the Briton, who cursed the lubberly Yankees right heartily. The sloop was now several cables' length astern.</p> 
               <p>"I don't like that manuvre, sir; he's running away," said the lieutenant of the watch.</p> 
               <p>"What! ha! the d-d rebel; fill away, sir; we'll sink him with a broadside!"</p> 
               <p>Commendable activity was displayed, but in the meantime the Yankee sloop was dashing away before a freshening breeze on her best point of sailing. In less than two minutes an iron shower from the frigate's guns hurtled above her deck, rending holes through her sails, and ploughing the ocean many a fathom ahead. The broadside did little or no damage-precipitation, and the usual fault of English gunnery, that of firing too high, having saved her. One loud echo of defiance boomed in response, from the brazen throat of a long eighteen, and the frigate's fore-topmast trembled with a shock, bowed to the iron messenger, and went tumbling over the side with its hamper of sails and rigging.</p> 
               <p>The British captain's rage knew no bounds, and he vowed all sorts of vengeance against his adversary, whom he yet believed himself able to overhaul. The wreck was quickly cleared, and sail made on the frigate; but fortune was with the American, and, unharmed either by his menaoes or his broadsides, the little sloop Providence glided swiftly beyond the reach of his vengeance, bearing away in proud triumph, from his first brilliant naval exploit, the dauntless JOHN PAUL JONES!</p>

               <head>THE BAFFLED TORY.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AN INCIDENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.</head> 
               <p>IT was one evening in the winter of 17-that the winds whistled keenly, and the snow-drift whirled wildly around a fine old mansion on the banks of the Delaware. Within the scene was one of comfort and cheer: a large fire blazed on the ample hearth, and clear wax candles illuminated the apartment where the family of Colonel Gifford, together with several favorite guests, were assembled. The conversation partook of the engrossing topic of the day, the struggles of the Colonies, the heroism of their great champion and leader, and the wavering fortunes of the patriot armies. The Colonel, whose immense wealth had been freely contributed to the cause of his country, had seen some service in the early part of the war; but a severe wound, and his advanced age, was sufficient excuse for his retirement, in which he was happily undisturbed, even by the ferocious and mercenary bands of Tories who infested the country. This was attributed, by those who professed to know, and, perhaps, correctly so, to the solicitous care of a near relative, high in the service of the king, whose efforts were no doubt facilitated by the design of the British Commander-in-Chief to conciliate, if possible, a Colonist whose wealth and position gave him great influence, and whose good will would be most favorable to the royal cause, in the event of the triumph of their arms. Let this have been as it might, Rock Hall was a sanctum, as yet, uninvaded by the rude alarms of war, and its hospitality was famous; not only the suffering patriot, but not unfrequently some wounded and unfortunate royalist found shelter beneath its roof.</p> 
               <p>Deep interest was evinced by all the little party collected around the cheerful fire on the cold winter evening when our story opens, in the subjects of conversation alluded to-except one individual, who sate contemplative and moody, his eye wandering ever and anon from the curling flames on the hearth, where it dwelt, as if his soul held communion and sympathy with the fierce element, to the sweet and lovely face of Alice Gifford, where enough of the Angel shone to have purified dark thoughts even in the breast of a demon. The person thus alluded to was a youth of fine, manly form, apparently about twenty-five, and possessed of one of those splendid countenances which fascinate us even against our judgement, where the beauty of the Archangel would seem to struggle for mastery with the passions of the Arch-fiend. In fact, the character of Albert Mercer, though it by no means lacked force and decisiveness, was scarcely comprehended as yet by those who should have known him best. With fine talents, an ample fortune, and good connexions, he had as yet loitered, an idler, in the paths of distinction, while other youths around him, possessed of less advantages, were reaping honor and fame. In the struggle which was going on he took no part, excusing himself to Colonel Gifford, his guardian, on the ground of doubts as to the right of the Colonists to resist, while he in part satisfied the old soldier with an indignant disavowal of any intention or thought of arming against his native land. In a word, Albert was a puzzle to those who were most interested in his career; who could not bear to see him wasting life idly, while his younger brother, Charles, who had already obtained a Captaincy in the Continental Army, at twenty-two years old, was winning honors in the field of glory.</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6942-00000041"/> 
               <p>A pause in the conversation drew the attention of Colonel Gifford to the young man.</p> 
               <p>"By the way," said the old man, addressing him, "I do not half like this contemplated journey of yours to New York. There seems to be no necessity for it, and the danger--"</p> 
               <p>At that word Albert Mercer raised his head proudly, and regarded his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ci-divant</foreign> guardian quickly, almost fiercely;</p> 
               <p>"Is nothing, sir," he said; "I have passports, and your own letter to Colonel Seymour, assuring him of the peaceable nature of my visit, and my neutrality in this unnatural warfare. Believe me, I shall be as safe within the British lines as under your hospitable roof."</p> 
               <p>"But the occasion scarce appears to me to warrant any risk, even that of a journey at this inclement season."</p> 
               <p>"I deem it important, sir; and though not a soldier like my brother Charles, am not altogether a milksop."</p> 
               <p>And his eyes again sought the face of Alice, in which so much interest was expressed that his heart bounded wildly, and a glow of soul-like beauty overspread his manly countenance, effacing every shadow which had darkened there.</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, my boy," responded the Colonel, "you are old enough to judge for yourself; take counsel of your pillow to-night and we will talk it over to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"Too late, sir, I depart to-night,"</p> 
               <p>"To-night!" exclaimed the old man, and the word was reached by several even from the sweet lips of Alice; "in this storm Albert? you must not."</p> 
               <p>Pardon me, dear Colonel," said the youth, rising and gracefully taking his hand "but I <emph>must;</emph> my reasons are good and you know a night-storm has no terrors for me. My horses will be ready in half hour; Boggs the ferryman, is forewarned of my intention, and before morning I shall be safe in Trenton. So my kind guardian, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans adieu,</foreign> I will to my apartment and prepare for the journey."</p> 
                
               <p>The whole family rose to take leave of Albert, who if not a prime favorite, had, from old associations and kindred ties, a strong hold on their regards. As he took Alice's hand he whispered quickly-</p> 
               <p>"Meet me in ten minutes in the Library-<emph>my life may depend on it.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>There was a depth in his tones that made the request an irresistible command; and though the fair girl shuddered, she did not think of refusing but, escaping unnoticed, in a few minutes later she sought the rendezvous. Albert Mercer was already waiting in the dimly lighted apartment.</p> 
               <p>"Alice," said the young man, with ill-suppressed emotion, "before we part, perhaps forever, I must again insist upon the reason for your peremptory and unqualified refusal of my love. We have known each other from childhood; in boyhood's dreams and manhood's hopes you have been the star of my devotion; your love the blessed influence I have wooed to dispel the dark clouds which seem to shadow my fate, and make my life one of sunshine and happiness! Is it because I have held back from this rebellion, that you despise me? Say but the word-promise me but your love-and to-morrow, instead of New York, I will seek Washington's camp; and he will not find among all his host a stouter arm or a more subtle brain to uphold the rebel cause!"</p> 
               <p>"Call it by a holier name," said the trembling girl.</p> 
               <p>"The <emph>patriot,</emph> then; for your love shall consecrate it as holiest of holy with me. Speak, Alice, shall it be?"</p> 
               <p>"No, no, no! "murmured she, burying her face in her hands, "it cannot-it cannot."</p> 
               <p>"And why not, pray? I am fair proportioned, rich, and love you almost to madness. You can mould me-and mine is no common soul-as you wish. Why not, Alice Gifford say?" and his tones fairly rung with the energy of passion.</p> 
               <p>"This is cruel, ungenerous, Albert!" said Alice, her spirit roused by what she deemed persecution. "I have told you I<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6942-00000042"/> cannot be your wife; but, as my playmate and relative, I feel an interest in your fate, and would to Heaven that, from honorable motives, I could see you follow the same path of duty and ambition with your noble brother. Then, indeed, should I rejoice in your success, and all of reward that Alice Gifford could bestow-her best sympathy and affections as FRIEND and SISTER-should be yours."</p> 
               <p>"And why not MY WIFE, Alice," said he, in a low, soft voice. The young girl shook her head mournfully.</p> 
               <p>"It cannot be. Let this importunity cease, Albert; and tell me why you sought this interview. You spoke of danger."</p> 
               <p>"Ay, to us both!" said Albert; Mercer, moodily; "danger from the wild fierce passions which you alone can curb into gentleness. My love is a madness that must be appeased; you must be mine, despite of heaven and hell. Nay," added he, grasping her arm firmly as she shrank in terror from his frantic words; "I ask no longer the cause of this persistent refusal-I know what fair-faced rival interferes. You spoke of my noble brother-let him look to it. Girl, beware!"</p> 
               <p>"Dare you threaten me?" demanded Alice, struggling to free herself.</p> 
               <p>"Aye! you-him-all!" exclaimed he, fiercely drawing to her to him.</p> 
               <p>A slight scream from Alice, and a noise at the other end of the apartment, brought the madman somewhat to his senses. Casting her from him with a force that fairly staggered her, he hissed forth once more the single word "beware," and strode from the room.</p> 
               <p>We will not follow Albert Mercer in his wild ride that stormy night; the winds without were tame to the tempest which raged within his bosom. Suffice it for the purposes of our narrative, that a week after he arrived in New York, he took service in the British cause, and received the commission of captain, with authority to raise a company among the royalists, and the promise, if he succeeded well, of higher rank. This news created much unhappiness when it reached the family at Rock Hall, to whom the particulars of his interviews with Alice were unsuspected; the generous and heroic girl being unwilling to create prejudice even against one who had treated her so unmanly.</p> 
               <p>When Albert Mercer threw Alice from him, she sank half-fainting with terror; for well she knew his dark passions-aye! better than any one save himself. Not wishing however, to expose his baseness, from the noblest motives, and hoping that her cry had not been heard, with a strong effort she retained her self-possession. A step approached, however, and a gentle hand sustained her drooping form.</p> 
               <p>"Fear nothing, dear lady," said a kindly voice; "I heard it all, and would have interfered sooner, but feared to complicate your position. The unmanly villain-violence to a lady!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh! sir, he was not himself; his fearful passions betray him; otherwise he has noble qualities."</p> 
               <p>"I can scarcely think such a disposition has anything good. However, he must be watched; your peace and happiness are too precious to be jeopardised by him."</p> 
               <p>"Nay, let me beseech you to forget this night's scene. I am in no danger, and to know Albert's baseness would only make my father and those who are dear to me unhappy."</p> 
               <p>"It must be as you please, dear lady. I owe you too much to dispute your slightest wish. But this madman must, nevertheless be looked to. He goes to the British army, with what purpose I can well guess, after this night's interview. That is also my destination, and as, thanks to your kind nursing, I am almost well, I will set out in the morning. I was accidentally in the library, and could not escape until I had over-heard most of your interview. Fear nothing-the stranger owes you deep thanks, and may live to repay. Now, let me advise the quiet of your own room, I will into the hall, and prevent all suspicions by explaining away this youth's unmannerly retreat.</p>

               <p>With fervent thanks Alice retired to profit by the stranger's advice.</p> 
               <p>And who was the unknown who had thus witnessed the painful interview between Alice Gifford and her rejected suitor? A British officer, past the middle age, of noble and gentle demeanor, but unknown to rank, who had been brought, about two months previous, to Rock Hall, desperately wounded, where he had enjoyed the hospitalities of the mansion, unquestioned of rank or name, and after a painful illness had barely recovered his health, under the careful treatment of a skilful surgeon, employed by Colonel Gifford, and the good nursing of Alice, to whom his age and misfortune rendered him an object of interest, and upon whom he had learned to look with the affection of a parent.</p> 
               <p>The next morning the stranger departed, with the kind wishes of the family, and a delicate proffer from the generous owner of the mansion, of funds to defray the expenses of his journey, which were gently, but firmly declined.</p>

               <p>It was about a month after the scene just related that a court of inquiry was held in the British camp near Trenton, to determine the fate of a prisoner who had just been captured, and was accused as a spy. He was a young soldier of gallant appearance and manly beauty, wearing the continental uniform, and exhibited, under the trying charge, the coolness and self-possession of true courage and conscious integrity. Although the expression of his clear blue eye was frank and fearless, yet a slight shade of trouble, evidently from some-cause foreign to his own position, occasionally stole over his countenance. The court was composed of a Colonel-a fine, soldierly and noble looking man, and several subordinate officers.</p> 
               <p>"What is your name and rank, sir?" demanded the President of the court of the prisoner, who, with his arms lightly folded across his breast, stood modestly, but fearlessly, facing that tribunal which, at a moment's warning, might consign him to an ignominious death.</p> 
               <p>"Charles Mercer, Captain in the Pennsylvania line of the continental service, at present attached to the personal staff of General Washington, Commander-in-chief."</p> 
               <p>There was a slight movement in the court at this announcement, and a shade of feeling passed over the countenance of the President.</p> 
               <p>"And might not the fate of Nathan Hale, young man," said he sternly, "have taught you better than to assume the office of spy?"</p> 
               <p>"I am no spy," said Charles Mercer proudly, "and yet," he added modestly, "to tread in the footsteps of Hale, to emulate the glory that will encircle his name forever, were worth a greater risk than mere life."</p> 
               <p>"The fate of a spy seems to me less honorable than you deem it. A truce with such discussions, however. Will you state frankly what brought you within the line of the royal army, if not that of a spy?"</p> 
               <p>"Freely, and without equivocation:-In the first place, I was not aware that I had come within the royal lines. The object of my visit to the spot where I was taken, was simply to obtain an interview with a near relative at present in the royal service."</p> 
               <p>"His name, and the purpose of your interview?"</p> 
               <p>"I decline to answer."</p> 
               <p>"The refusal will scarce serve your wish. See, this paper was found on your person," and he read:</p>

               <p>"And so, sir, you desired to seduce a loyal subject from his allegiance?"</p> 
               <p>"I wished to rescue an only brother from the consequences of madness and infatuation, and open to him a career of honor," said Charles Mercer proudly.</p> 
               <p>"Was it at his request that you obtained this high and mighty protection?" asked another member of the court.</p> 
               <p>Charles bit his lip, and was silent. There were other papers in his possession, of which he had been robbed while he slept at a countryman's cabin near the place of rendezvous, among them a long letter from Albert, begging an interview with Charles, that he might explain the reasons for his conduct, and throwing out hints which Charles construed into something like repentance of the step he had taken, and a willingness, if assured of forgiveness, to retrace his steps. Whether this letter had also fallen into the possession of the court, and how they might construe its contents, was what made him pause.</p> 
               <p>"You will better consult your brother's honor by a frank answer," said the member.</p> 
               <p>The President bit his lip, and was silent.</p> 
               <p>"His safety, at least, demands the whole truth. I had a letter from him soliciting an interview, for the purpose of explaining some portion of his conduct, at which he imagined I would be displeased, and of reconciling differences to which he vaguely alluded; knowing no other cause of dissatisfaction, on my part, than his late conduct in joining the royal forces, I attributed his expressions to a desire to retrace his steps, and felt anxious, at all risks, to aid what I conceived to be his honor. I may have entirely mistaken the meaning of his communication, and shall be indeed grieved if my mistake has jeopardized his safety."</p> 
               <p>I am happy to relieve your mind on that score," said the same officer. "That letter was also in our possession. Captain Albert Mercer was examined by the Commander-in Chief this morning, to whom he gave a satisfactory explanation of his letter; and it is due to him further to say, that he stated the place of rendezvous appointed was beyond the British lines, and that it was a mistake, he has no doubt, which brought you within them."</p> 
               <p>"Let Captain Albert Mercer be called into court," said the President.</p> 
               <p>"He has been sent on special service with his troop, by the Commander-in-Chief, and will not return for two days," said the same member who had acted as spokesman.</p> 
               <p>"Then," said the President, "I shall remand the prisoner and adjourn the court-until he returns. British honor shall never suffer the stain of injustice in my hands," added he, a shade of sternness coming over his countenance.</p> 
               <p>The mind of Charles Mercer was sadly perplexed when once more alone. He knew no differences for which his brother should seek a reconciliation unless it was on account of the latter's defection from the cause of his country; the denial as to the place of rendezvous, about which it appeared to him there could be no mistake, and Albert's doubtful vindication of his purposes, sorely confused him. There had never been a difference between Albert and Charles, to the latter's knowledge. The passion of his elder brother for his own betrothed, his courtship, refusal, and the scene we have described, were all unknown to him; and if the younger had not always approved of the elder's conduct, he at least suspected no cause of unkindness. So that, in a pretty fair state of mystification he passed the next twenty-four hours.</p> 
               <p>When the colonel had adjourned the court, he at once sought the presence of his commander, and learned that the mission of Albert Mercer had been of his own seeking. He had asked permission with his <unclear>troops to</unclear> attempt the capture of a continental officer high in the confidence of General Washington, with the promise of being able to obtain some useful information; giving, as one of his reasons for desiring<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6942-00000045"/> the service, his unwillingness to appear at the trial of his brother, whose position he affected to believe extremely doubtful. A glow of indignation suffused the cheek of the veteran colonel, but he constrained his feelings, and merely solicited the use of a troop, and forty-eight hours leave, which was granted him without question.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>How often do circumstances favor the accomplishment of villany! It was on the evening of the day of Charles Mercer's examination that the family at Rock Hall were all, save one, seated around the cheerful hearth. The shades of night were closing over, and the wind became every moment keener.</p> 
               <p>"Alice is late," said Colonel Gifford to his wife. "I trust no accident has befallen."</p> 
               <p>"No danger, my dear," said the lady. "It is but a short step to Widow Jones' cottage, and Alice took Talbot with her, and it would be a bold man that would interfere with her when the dog is by."</p> 
               <p>"I do not like these visits on foot at such an hour," said the Colonel testily. "If she must nurse the poor, let her take proper attendance. Hark! is not that Talbot's bark?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my dear," replied the good wife, "you see she has returned safely."</p> 
               <p>In another instant the melancholy howl of the dog was heard at the front door, and Colonel Gifford sprang to his feet, maugre the gout, and rushed to ascertain the cause, followed by the whole family.</p> 
               <p>"Where is Alice? Where is my daughter?" exclaimed the old man frantically, as he perceived the dog was alive, and the faithful animal, as if in answer, whined piteously, and then turning his head in the direction of the cabin where she had gone forth on her mission of charity, uttered a long, heart-rending howl.</p> 
               <p>"John-Thomas-lads, quick!" exclaimed the old Colonel, with energy,"get me my hat and cane-and let us search for your young mistress."</p> 
               <p>At this moment a wild hurra! rang out upon the night breeze, and the clash of weapons, and the gallop of mounted troops were heard.</p> 
               <p>"Hist, husband!" whispered Mrs. Gifford. "Alice is safe-she is doubtless still at the cabin, and prudently refrained from coming out when she heard the soldiers."</p> 
               <p>The mansion was speedily surrounded with Tory troopers, and the anxious father, compelled to occupy himself with the safety of the rest of his family, was fain to rejoice at the absence of his favorite, under the hope that she would escape the violence he dreaded from men whose savage and marauding dispositions were proverbial.</p> 
               <p>The officer in command quickly informed Colonel Gifford that he was a prisoner, by order of Lord Howe, and must accompany him to the British camp. He showed, however, more courtesy than could have been expected, and agreed to accept the hospitalities of Rock Hall, for himself and men, while its proprietor made hasty preparations for departure. This was the troop of Albert Mercer, who had remained in the background himself, while he plotted to involve the father as he had already done the lover of Alice, and thus obtain an influence over her fears she dared not resist; and who intended to come forward with a small guard after the departure of Colonel Gifford, and by force or fraud obtain possession of Alice herself, and if he could not work upon her apprehensions, through her affections, to favor his suit, resort, if necessary, to more violent means.</p> 
               <p>We have said that circumstances often favor villany. Albert Mercer had halted near the cottage where Alice was, and unfortunately recognising the dog Talbot, which he knew was almost her inseparable companion, at once suspected her presence, and stationing his men so as to prevent a surprise, he entered the cabin alone. The terror of Alice was great when<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6942-00000046"/> she saw who the unbidden visitor was, though she endeavored to repress it.</p> 
               <p>"Albert!" she said, "You here?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Alice, Albert has come to his wooing, and expects a smoother answer than when last we met."</p> 
               <p>"Have you not forgotten that madness yet? Oh! Albert, let your better nature have way, and respect the feelings of one who has been to you even as a sister!"</p> 
               <p>"Aye! I know what that word implies; but, listen to me, Alice. You have no hope but in compliance with my wishes; refuse my hand and you bring down innumerable ills on all you love; accept it, and your wish shall be my law. Already is Charles a prisoner in the British camp, under the charge of being a spy; his doom is in my hands."</p> 
               <p>"Your brother! You will save him?"</p> 
               <p>"Never, to be your husband. This is not all; the British commander finds it necessary to use more rigor. Under a charge of treason, your father is by this time arrested."</p> 
               <p>"My father! my dear father! Oh! let me fly to him."</p> 
               <p>"No," said he, sternly and resolutely barring the door, despite the feeble cries of the sick woman, and Alice's unutterable looks of anguish which could find no tongue. "No, you <emph>must</emph> hear me out. Both these dear ones can I, will I save, if you will be my wife-it is my own troop who have just arrested your father; he shall be released at your command. It was my hand that lured Charles into the snare; its meshes shall be cobwebs at your wish. You see, dear Alice, what a resolute wooer I am: fate favors me; your gentle heart will never allow the sacrifice of a father and lover. Come, you consent-is it not so?"</p> 
               <p>"Never, villain! doubly-dyed villain, never! My lover would scorn, my father disown me," she exclaimed, starting up with the air of a Pythoness.</p> 
               <p>"Then, so be it," said the ruffian, with deep concentrated passion. "Mine I have sworn you should be, and mine on worse terms I will make you."</p> 
               <p>Alice gazed a moment on his features as he approached-the purpose of a demon was there-and with one wild heart-rending scream, she flew even to the couch of the poor invalid, whose presence her tormentor had entirely disregarded, for protection. It was this wild scream as by some instinct of his faithful nature, which sent Talbot home howling for aid. A smile of devilish triumph lit the countenance of Albert Mercer, as he approached his victim.</p> 
               <p>"It is my turn now, Alice, and there is no person on earth to save you. You have scorned my love, refused my hand; you shall go forth ready to crave my favor as the only boon on earth that can save you from disgrace."</p> 
               <p>The very blood of Alice Gifford congealed at his words, and she shook with an unearthly tremor as he put forth his hand to seize her. But that unhallowed touch was never destined to pollute her virgin form; an iron grasp fell upon his shoulder, and a stern voice exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"I arrest you, sir! Give up your sword!"</p> 
               <p>To spring back, and unsheath his weapon, was, with one of Albert Mercer's activity, the work of an instant.</p> 
               <p>"By what authority?" he demanded.</p> 
               <p>"That of your superior officer, finding you in gross dereliction of duty-that of a man who finds you outraging innocence and virtue!" exclaimed the Colonel, for it was he,</p> 
               <p>"Saved!-saved!-oh! my deliverer!" murmured lice, as she sank fainting on the sick woman's bed.</p> 
               <p>The idea flashed upon Albert Mercer in an instant, that perhaps his superior officer was alone, and knowing that the men whom he had stationed around the cabin were devoted to him body and soul-wretches who would scruple at nothing he commanded-in a moment he determined to act on it.</p> 
               <p>"This is none of your affair, worthy Colonel; the service I am on excuses me from your command-in a word, this is<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6942-00000047"/> a hazard on which I have set my life, and you <emph>shall not</emph> baffle me. I have men who will do my bidding, even in opposition to you, so out of my way!" exclaimed he, advancing sword in hand, "or the consequences be upon your own head!"</p> 
               <p>"So be it, fool!" exclaimed the Colonel, without moving a muscle-his very smile of derision and scorn checking the approach of the desperate gambler. "Think you that I would come single handed to baffle an unscrupulous knave like you, when I knew him backed by such fellows in villany? Ho! there," and on the instant three troopers of the British regulars burst into the apartments, and seeing the condition of affairs, leveled their carbines at Mercer.</p> 
               <p>"Have you caught the rest of the vermin?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Colonel."</p> 
               <p>"Then, disarm that fellow, and keep him a close prisoner."</p> 
               <p>As the troopers hurried the baffled Tory off, the Colonel turned to raise Alice.</p> 
               <p>"There, my dear little nurse, the stranger has paid some part of his debt."</p> 
               <p>See raised her tearful eyes, and recognizing the wounded officer she had so kindly tended, and who witnessed her interview with Albert, threw herself, sobbing, into his arms.</p> 
               <p>"My father, my father, oh! save him, he, too, is in the villain's power."</p> 
               <p>"Fear nothing, Alice, my troop are by this time at Rock Hall, and your father is relieved from arrest. Believe me, I have baffled <emph>all his schemes.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>A conscious blush from Alice told that she had understood his full meaning.</p> 
               <p>There was deep joy at Rock Hall that evening, where Alice returned safe, and good old Colonel Gifford learned that his late guest had been his benefactor and the saviour of his child.</p> 
               <p>"And now, my dear sir, you will no longer refuse us your name-your rank we already know."</p> 
                
               <p>At that moment an officer came in to inform his commander that his orders had been obeyed, and Captain Mercer sent with his own troop, under arrest, to head quarters. In making the report, he addressed his superior as Colonel Seymour.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Colonel Seymour!</emph>" exclaimed both father and daughter.</p> 
               <p>"Aye, my kind sir, your relative as well as friend."</p> 
               <p>"But why this concealment?"</p> 
               <p>"A whim, which you must forgive. We were personally unknown to each other, and having been brought to your house wounded, I wished to try if you possessed all the old-time virtues I had heard attributed to you."</p> 
               <p>"Never was forgiveness of a whim more nobly won," said Colonel Gifford, smiling.</p> 
               <p>The next day Alice and her father accompanied Colonel Seymour to Headquarters, where his influence soon obtained the release of Charles Mercer on parole; but the joy of all parties were shadowed by the reflection of Albert's dishonorable conduct. Luckily for them, however, he was permitted to escape by his guard, and thus a meeting, which must have been painful, was prevented. A stern caution from Lord Howe, however, deprived him of followers, and consequently, of much of his power to do evil.</p> 
               <p>After an interview with Colonel Gifford, the British commander, convinced of his incorruptible patriotism, suffered him to return to Rock Hall, with an assurance of the same protection he had hitherto enjoyed. Charles Mercer accompanied him, and remained until he received notice of his exchange, which was on the day before the Battle of Trenton.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>It was at the close of that glorious contest, in which Charles Mercer had won new laurels, that, as he was galloping to a distant part of the field, at the head of a small troop, to execute some command of WASHINGTON, he encountered a similar body of the enemy, who, to his surprise,<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6942-00000048"/> boldly charged him, their leader, begrimmed with powder and smoke, singling him out personally. The contest was evidently in favor of the Americans, but no sooner had Charles Mercer crossed swords with his opponent than he recognized his brother.</p> 
               <p>"Back, Albert! back! What would you do?" exclaimed he.</p> 
               <p>"Die! or avenge myself," cried the infuriate, pressing on, and raising his sabre high. The fratricidal blow was never destined to fall, for at the moment a bullet, from a carbine in the rear, pierced his brain, and at the feet of the brother he had sought to injure, Albert Mercer fell a corpse!</p>

               <p>WHO has not heard of the prison ships of the Wallabout? who that has read the glorious annals of our Revolutionary struggles and triumphs, is ignorant that, among the other barbarities practised by the mother country during the War of Independence, <emph>eleven thousand five hundred American prisoners perished by a fate horrible as that of the victims of the black hole of Calcutta!</emph> Alas! how often have ambition and policy tarnished the glory of Great Britain! But no blacker spot rests upon her escutcheon than the history of these very prison ships. Often as the bright page of her military achievements has been darkened by a war policy, which would disgrace a horde of barbarian robbers, yet it seems incredible at the present day that thousands and thousands of their American brethren, men bound to them by the sacred ties of common parentage, and recent amity, should have been crowded like the basest malefactors into those festering dens of disease, to endure a martyrdom of privation, suffering, and death, more cruel than the tortures of the savage!</p> 
               <p>In October 1776, the first ship was anchored in the Wallabout. She was named the <hi rend="i"/>Whitby, and was moored near "Remsen's Mill," crowded with prisoners, whose condition is<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6942-00000049"/> described as miserable, <emph>beyond even exaggeration.</emph> Starvation and pestilence were the familiar guests of these unfortunate patriots, who sealed their devotion to the cause of their country by sufferings to which the death of the battle-field were as slumber on "a bed of roses!" Wretched provisions, worse water, and scanty allowance, without a physician to attend the sick, were the tender mercies which their enemies meted out to these men of kindred blood and association, whose only crime was that love of liberty inspired by the glorious recollections of a common ancestry, and which eventually achieved a triumph for all time!</p> 
               <p>In two months' time the sand beach was lined with the graves of the half-buried corpses. In May, 1777, two other ships were anchored near, and the prisoners transferred from the <hi rend="i"/>Whitby; but the same fatal neglect, the same cruel barbarism left them to perish still from the same causes. In October, 1777, one of these ships caught fire, and was consumed, destroying a number of the unhappy victims; and in February, 1778, the remaining prison ship was burnt-the prisoners being transferred to other vessels then wintering in the Wallabout; but in April, '78, the sick were transferred to two hospital ships called the <hi rend="i"/>Hope and <hi rend="i"/>Fulmouth, while the others were sent on board the old <hi rend="i"/>Jersey. All three may, however, have been well termed <hi rend="i"/>Death-ships, for few left them except as borne to their long homes.</p> 
               <p>It was from this ship, the <hi rend="i"/>Jersey, that a most daring and successful escape was effected in December, 1780. Among the prisoners were four captains of merchant vessels from New England; who had been some months immured in this floating prison, and had witnessed with abhorrence and sickening dread the fate of those around them, until they had determined at every risk to escape from the horrors of their hopeless captivity. Many and various were the plans they contrived, none of which, however, seemed feasible. The ship was well guarded; the sentries always on the alert; and more than one poor fellow, who, as chance occurred, had thrown himself into the water with the faint hope of reaching the shore, had sunk, riddled with their bullets; and though such a death were better, perhaps, than the lingering one of disease and privation, yet it was escape our captains desired, and not voluntary immolation. Fortune at last favored them. One stormy afternoon in December, the best and fastest boat of the ship returned from New York, and was left for a few moments, without a keeper, at the gangway with the oars on board. The sentry who usually paced a platform on the outside of the ship. had, on account of the inclemency of the weather, been allowed to walk his rounds under shelter of the bulwarks. The quick eye of one of our captains took in at a glance the state of things, and a preconcerted signal was immediately given. Their contemplated enterprise had, of course, become known to their fellow sufferers; and though many a sinking heart quickened with the impulse to join in the chances of escape, and many a weary spirit would have expended its last energies to catch one ray of hope, yet the possibility of deliverance even for themselves, was more than doubtful, and must fail had they attempted to effect that of any portion of their miserable companions. Charged, then, with many a love message and token of affection from breaking hearts in captivity and despair, to the loved ones who were pining at home, our adventurers prepared alone to brave the hazards of their desperate undertaking; while with the constancy and devotion which suffering alone can teach, their companions were ready, even at the risk of life, to afford them aid.</p> 
               <p>As I have said, when one of the number had perceived the condition of the boat at the gangway, a preconcerted signal was given, and quicker than I can describe it, the following feat was accomplished. The sentry had turned, and was pacing towards the stern of the ship, with his back, of course, to the gangway, when a number of the prisoners crowded confusedly between him and the waist of the ship. There<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6942-00000050"/> seemed nothing suspicious in the movement, but yet the soldier turned to curse them for trespassing upon his walk, and some little altercation took place, which still further engrossed his attention, for he was in a moment busily selecting victims for punishment. At this junction our four captains slipped down unperceived in the boat, which was cast off by the friends. An incident occurred, however, even in this short space of time, that gave a more romantic interest to the enterprise. While the adventurers were getting into the boat, a tall, athletic, and handsome man, handsome even despite the tattered habiliments and haggard appearance which imprisonment and suffering had left him-pressed to the ship's side, almost dragging a pale, fair youth, somewhat better clad than his comrades. A few brief, earnest words passed.</p> 
               <p>"I say it must be!" said the man, firmly, passing his arm around the youth.</p> 
               <p>"Never-never! William, I will die with you," gasped the other, slightly struggling.</p> 
               <p>"Remember your poor old father. I may escape yet."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, now, now!" eagerly exclaimed the youth. "Come with me now."</p> 
               <p>"It cannot be!" said the other, bitterly; "but come you-quick! Captain James understands."</p> 
               <p>And disregarding the muttered "no, no!" as well as the slight resistance which was offered, the strong man caught the light form of his companion in one arm, while with the other hand he swung himself over the ship's side, dropped his fainting burden gently into the boat, cast off her moorings, and was on board again before the sentry had half expended his ire upon the offenders.</p> 
               <p>Quick as thought, the boat was hauled under the bows of the ship, each man handled his oar promptly and quietly-a slight shove, and a few powerful strokes, and the little craft shot ahead with wind and tide in her favor, and was more than a cable's length from the ship, when the sentry on the forecastle, whose attention had been attracted, momentarily, to the noise at the gangway, first perceived her, and gave the alarm by firing at her, His shot was harmless, however; and though other boats were immediately manned, and pursuit given, our bold sea-captains had their strong arms nerved, and their brave hearts inspired by too great an interest to be easily re-taken. That night the boat passed Hell Gate safely, and arrived next morning in Connecticut.</p> 
               <p>It was not until pursuit was fairly distanced, that they had time to notice the intrusion of the youth who had been so unceremoniously bundled into their boat; and who had partly recovered. A few words of explanation, however, from Captain James, informing them that the youth, who had passed unbound, as the brother of the individual who thus secured <emph>her</emph> escape, was no other than the self-sacrificing, devoted wife of the prisoner, who had condemned herself to the privations and horrors of a prison-ship, that she might share the captivity and comfort the sorrows of her husband, enlisted every generous sympathy in the bosoms of her companions, and won for her a regard amounting almost to veneration. To comfort and cheer her through the perils of their rough night-voyage, and to convey her safely to the home of her father next day, became a sacred task, which was happily accomplished.</p> 
               <p>The story of this heroic wife was an instance of beautiful but common devotion among her sex; for when has man suffered and woman failed to soothe? Deeply, as I have intimated, were the hearts of her rough, but generous companions, touched; and hence the tender solicitude and care which she elicited until she was restored to the sorrowing heart of her only parent, to gladden once more his fireside, and cheer the evening of his days.</p> 
               <p>Julia Danby had been betrothed, previous to the breaking out of the hostilities, to a brave and gallant youth, who was<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6942-00000051"/> scarcely less a favorite with her old father, than with his partial daughter. When the first scenes of the Revolution aroused the pulse of patriotism throughout the length and breadth of the land, old Jacob Danby was one of the most eager and fiery advocates of resistance; and but that age had palsied his limbs, and thinned his blood, would have been among the first to oppose his bosom to British bayonets, in defence of his country's rights. Though unable to serve personally in the ranks of his countrymen, Jacob found a willing and enthusiastic substitute in the person of young William Stanton, his only daughter's affianced husband. The parting with Julia was hard; but she was a true American girl, in whose heart many a lesson of patriotism from the lips of her venerated parent had sunk deep; and great as was the reluctance of her loving heart to venture its cherished idol upon so dangerous a career, she yet bade God shield and protect him with admirable firmness, while her father grasping his hand nervously, exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"Go, <emph>my son,</emph> and serve your country bravely; and when you return, there is your reward," pointing to his beautiful daughter.</p> 
               <p>After gallant and meritorious services in two campaigns, William Stanton returned to his loved home in Connecticut, and received the hand of his beloved Julia in rich recompense of his patriotism and devotion. The cause of his country, however, was still doubtful; and it was not for a mind like his to rest inactive at such a period; or be short of the triumph of those glorious principles of civil liberty which had sunk deep into his heart. A few weeks given to the fond delights of domestic love, and William again announced his determination to volunteer. It was perhaps harder for the young wife to part with her husband than the betrothed maiden with her lover; but with heroic fortitude she again sent him forth to battle for freedom.</p> 
               <p>The career of Stanton was less fortunate. Six months after he left his home the second time, he found himself wounded, and a prisoner on board a floating dungeon! surrounded by disease, starvation and misery! Yet within his bosom was a talisman which sustained him through the accumulated horrors of the prison-ship. The bright vision of home, and the loved one there, cheered him through the long, dreary hours of sickness and confinement, and gave him strength to endure. His efforts to be exchanged were constant and unavailing. Escape, too, seemed hopeless. And it was only after twelve months' imprisonment, that through the humanity of an English officer, who visited the prison-ship, and seemed much to commiserate the sufferings of himself and companions, he was enabled to communicate his situation to his wife and father.</p> 
               <p>Five or six weeks had passed without any news in return, when one day a fresh batch of prisoners were brought on board the Jersey; and among them a slight, well-dressed youth, whose pallid countenance, and tearful eyes, were full of deep emotion, as with eager regards he seemed to scan the features of the miserable, squalid crew among whom he was thrown. The object of his inquiry did not present itself until fortunately, he had wandered to a more retired part of the ship; when suddenly he threw himself into the arms of a stern, melancholy, but still young and handsome man, who had been standing apart from the crowd of his fellows.</p> 
               <p>To paint the surprise, the delight, the almost overpowering emotions of William Stanton, as he held that dearly-loved form once more in his arms, is beyond the power of language. The recognition was instant, notwithstanding her stained features and almost impenetrable disguise; but with admirable presence of mind, William, as soon as he recovered the coherence of his speech, called her his dear brother; and as such she passed six long months, during which time she shared without a murmur, the imprisonment and privations of her husband, softening with woman's love and<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6942-00000052"/> constancy his fate, and shedding light and hope even through the gloom of a prison-ship!</p> 
               <p>The presence of Julia under her disguise, though it had been inviolably kept, could not but he a subject of care and anxiety to her husband; especially as her health began at last to fail, notwithstanding all her devotion and fortitude; William was becoming almost maddened with the embarrassment, for Julia resolutely refused to leave him; when the plan of escape was formed by our four brave captains. To one of these, however, Captain James, whom he had known from boyhood, he communicated his secret; and the generous-hearted sailor at once agreed to aid him. The prompt firmness with which the young husband acted, as has been related, accomplished the escape of his wife, and her restoration to her aged parent, who she found with his candle of life well nigh exhausted in gloom and despair.</p> 
               <p>Before Captain James left Mrs. Stanton, he explained to her the plan of escape by which her husband hoped to join her ere long; promising also, his own active assistance. That William had not joined them in the boat, she now understood, was from a chivalrous sense of honor, as no preference could have been justly shown him over his wretched comrades, and that he must, after her departure, explain even his conduct in that respect.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>About ten days after the adventure I have related a boat from the Jersey prison-ship landed on the sand-beach between Remsen's dock and a deep ravine in the hill. Two men, with each a spade, got out, and lifting or rather dragging <emph>a long heavy bundle, sewed up in a blanket,</emph> made their way a few feet beyond high-water-mark, and casting rudely down their burden, struck their implements into the sand, and paused a moment as if for breath, to commence their labors.</p> 
               <p>"Come, Tom," said one, after a few moments pause; "let's bear a hand, and stow the bloody rebel away, and get on board.</p> 
                
               <p>For my part, I can't see why they can't chuck 'em overboard at once, and be d-d to 'em."</p> 
               <p>"Why you see, Jim, that might spoil the fishing, the admiral and officers is so fond of. The flavor of a dead rebel being rather an unpalatable taste. And then thirty-two pound shot ain't so plenty, and nothing less would keep 'em down. Whereas it ain't good luck to have a corpse float after a ship, so come let's get to work. The hole needn't be very deep I 'spose."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no, a little sand throw'd over 'em 'll do. You see the buzzards scratches 'em up any how," answered his companion carelessly. And having straightened the figure, which was no less than that of a fellow-being, <emph>and turned the face downwards,</emph> with the jocular remark that, so he could "see his way before him," he commenced throwing the sand slightly and carelessly over it.</p> 
               <p>"Avast! there Jim," exclaimed his companion suddenly "By the holy poker! but I'll have that hankercher off his muzzle, afore he's covered up."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, for a d-d fool, and ketch the stiffleus fever, (typhus I suppose) he died on," retorted the other with a sneer, continuing his labor, which was soon allowed to flag, and as his companion offered no objection to leave their work half finished, they quickly sought their boat, and rowed aboard.</p> 
               <p>During this brutal scene, two earnest watchers were hid a little way within the ravine, the impatience of one of whom could scarcely be restrained.</p> 
               <p>"Now, now! my dear friend, they are off, let us to his rescue."</p> 
               <p>"Hist! patience child: or you will spoil all."</p> 
               <p>"But he will die, he will suffocate!" implored the first speaker.</p> 
               <p>"Fear nothing. Did you not see his head was turned down, and that a handkerchief was around his mouth. Depend upon it that sailor was his friend, and rough as he seemed, did<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6942-00000053"/> evrything for the best; throwing his companion off his guard too, admirably. Nay, be quiet, to be seen now, would be to risk an adventure that is well nigh successful."</p> 
               <p>It was with some difficulty the impatient being could be kept back until the boat reached the ship, and then she flew to the spot, and with quick busy hands, tore away the sand-exhuming <emph>the body of her husband,</emph> well, in all save some exhaustion, and the embarrassment of being sewed up in a blanket.</p> 
               <p>The reader has doubtless interpreted the whole scene I have attempted to describe. For three nights, Captain James, and Julia Stanton had been on the watch, to aid in carrying out the plan devised by her husband for escape; which was to feign sickness, and counterfeit death. This he was enabled to do successfully, as we have seen, by having made a friend of one of the very men, whose duty it was to give the bodies of the poor victims their imperfect sepulture. The stratagem of the handkerchief, by which he was enabled to breathe noiselessly, and which in the event of a more careful burial would have been of evident advantage; and the admirable dispositions of his friend for his comfort, while pretending the most brutal roughness, will all seem clear enough to the reader.</p> 
               <p>The escape of William Stanton and his wife was completely successful; but the trials he had undergone, by no means damped the ardor of the young patriot; for in a few months, after he recovered perfectly his health he again volunteered, against the decided opposition of his wife, and served with distinction until the close of the war when he returned unharmed and full of honor to his fond wife and beloved home.</p> 
               <p>This was one of the escapes, and perhaps almost the only one from those floating dens of torture and misery; but what became of the companions of his suffering? In the words of the historian, "they lingered where no eye of pity witnessed their agony; no voice administered consolation; no tongue could praise their patriotic devotion, or friendly hand be stretched out for their relief. To pass the weary day and night, unvaried, except by new scenes of painful endurance, and new infliction of hopeless misery. The hope of death was to them the only consolation, which their situation afforded."</p>

            <p>The immense sale of this deeply interesting work fully proves the hold it has taken on popular favor. It is indeed one of the most fascinating novels that has recently been published, and exhibits the trials, the light and dark shades of a servant-maid's life, in a manner at once powerful, and such as to absorb the intense interest of the reader. It is in fact a domestic mirror, in which the reader will behold, depicted with truth, all kinds of masters and mistresses of families, and the many good and evil ways in which households can be managed. It is one of Reynolds' best efforts.-<title>The Times,</title>
