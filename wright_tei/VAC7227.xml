            <head>PREFACE.</head> 
            <p>THE following story of Irish evictions for conscience' sake, is, unhappily, "an o'er true tale." The incidents on which it is founded, may thus be stated:</p> 
            <p>Simultaneously with the great famine of 1846, a scheme was inaugurated, as is well known, under the auspices of certain societies in England, for the conversion of Ireland to Protestantism. It is needless to dwell on the history of that great evangelising project, which was to make conversions through distributions of bibles, soup, and tracts to a starving people. As the famine spread, the movement spread with it, though not as extensively as had been hoped by its fanatical originators. But as soon as the terrible pressure of the famine years passed away, bible-readers, soup-makers, and tract-distributors found their profitable occupation gone. The bubble had burst, but it was not permitted to<pb n="iv-v" xml:id="VAC7227-00000003"/> fade into thin air. To this day the imposture is kept up, and thousands of deluded contributors to the "grandest missionary enterprise of the age," confidently expect <emph>soon</emph> to hear of the conversion of the Irish <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse</foreign> "from the superstitions of Popery."</p> 
            <p>Among those engaged in "the good work," none has shown a more active or unscrupulous zeal than Lord Plunket, Protestant Bishop of Tuam, and Peer of the United Kingdom. His influence in Church and State, and his position as landlord of a great portion of the town of Partry and its vicinity, afford him many facilities for promoting the cause of evangelization, and these he has never failed to improve to the utmost. The tenantry for a time resisted; but at length, intimidated by fear of the landlord, and harassed by the incessant importunities of his daughters, ministers, and agents, were compelled to send their children to the schools established by his Lordship, ostensibly for the education of the poor children, but really, as was afterwards acknowledged by some of his co-laborers, for the purpose of teaching the scholars "the pure and simple religion of the gospel."</p> 
             
            <p>Archbishop MacHale, the "Lion of the West," beheld with sorrow the condition of this portion of his flock, and from among the ranks of the pious and learned clergy who so well second his arduous labors, he selected the REV. PATRICK LAVELLE, as pre-eminently qualified for the difficult and important mission of Partry. The result proved the holy prelate's sagacity. Father Lavelle, by his shining virtues, most of all by his active charity and solicitude for his flock, soon won their unlimited confidence and affection, while he became the terror of the proselytisers by his boldness and energy in combating their various schemes. Insults and threats were in turn resorted to, but vain was every effort to drive him from the field, or force him to adopt a temporising policy. Entering with his whole soul into the cause of his tempted and sorely-tried parishioners, he labored incessantly, with that self-sacrificing, apostolic spirit so characteristic of the Catholic priesthood, "to defend them against the snares of the enemy." The blessing of Heaven crowned his efforts with success. Most of the famine-converts returned<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC7227-00000004"/> to the fold; the prosperity of the landlord's schools declined, while the parish schools, established by Father Lavelle, flourished in a corresponding ratio. Finding his plans thus frustrated, Lord Plunket determined on vigorous measures. His tenantry were informed, by means of printed papers, of his earnest desire that their children should attend the schools by him established; while his daughters, ministers and agents went from house to house, harassing the poor parents by their importunities, and terrifying them by significant threats of the fate they might expect, if refractory. Finally, notices to quit were served, and on the 21st, 22d, and 23d of November, 1860, some three-score human beings were turned out of their homes in the midst of a violent storm of rain and sleet. One of the tenants, John Prendergast, was pardoned after being thus evicted, but in the following April was again evicted, with his wife and nine children, without a moment's warning; to make way for one who had complied with his Lordship's "earnest desire."</p> 
            <p>Lord Plunket, on finding the public shocked by the cruelty of his proceedings, endeavored to justify himself, by laying various charges against the "priest of Partry" and the evicted tenants; but these were triumphantly refuted. At the Galway assizes testimony was given sufficient to satisfy every unprejudiced mind that the proselytising school-system was the cause of the Partry evictions. John Prendergast testified that, dreading the consequences of a refusal, he, for a time, consented to send some of his children to the schools; but that, during that time, "not a bit he eat did him any good; for he knew he was acting contrary to his conscience and to God." Another of the evicted tenants, Patrick Staunton, deposed on oath, that the bailiff came and demanded his children, on pain of eviction; that he answered, "he would not pay Lord Plunket two rents-his money and his conscience;" that he then got notice to quit, and was evicted. Other evidence was given to the same effect, which neither Lord Plunket nor any of his friends who were present, could gainsay; to which might be added the convincing fact, that only those tenants who refused<pb n="viii-7" xml:id="VAC7227-00000005"/> fused to send their children to the landlord's schools were evicted.</p> 
            <p>The story of the "Confessors of Connaught" is founded on the incidents connected with the several evictions. The authoress has in no instance exaggerated the shocking realities of this case of bigotry and misguided zeal. Her aim has been to pay a tribute, though but an humble one, to the apostolic spirit of the Irish priesthood, as exemplified in the indomitable "Priest of Partry," and to the heroic fidelity displayed in many touching instances by their persecuted, but ever-faithful people. The hand of the stranger and the proselytiser presses heavily on Ireland in this boasted age of religious freedom. Especially is it felt in the wild regions of Connaught, where numbers of persecuted tenants have nobly earned the proud title bestowed on them by Archbishop MacHale, of "the faithful and intrepid Confessors of Connaught. And prominent on the part of "faithful Erin" will always be cherished the memory of the tenants of the Protestant Bishop of Tuam.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Festival of Corpus Christi.</head> 
               <p>IT was one of those perfect days which only June, the monarch of the year, with roses for his crown, bestows on the world, blending the dewy freshness of spring with summer's rich glow and wealth of bloom. No lingering trace of winter's rude ravages-no premonition of scorching heat in shrivelled leaf or withered flower-but all nature, freshened by the spring rains and vivified by the spring sunbeams, looking as fair, as pure as Eden may have looked to our first parents, ere the deadly blight<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7227-00000006"/> of sin fell upon the world, which the Creator's voice had pronounced good.</p> 
               <p>From the glowing west the sun threw a flood of golden light over the picturesque town of Bartrymore, nestled among the wild hills of Connaught, shaded by remnants of once magnificent woods, and watered by gurgling springs leaping cascades, and tiny streamlets, now flashing out like "skeins of silver" among the green fields, now hiding coyly away amid rocks and trees. It was a week-day, yet all sounds of labor were hushed. The grain fields, rich with luxurious promise, were deserted; the patient companions of the husbandman's toil roamed in freedom through the commons and pastures. No children loitered through the streets; no shop was open, and, save for a solitary form now and then appearing at a door or window, the place would have seemed uninhabited. At one sacred spot-one central point of interest-had the inhabitants of Bartrymore, of all ages and conditions, assembled.</p> 
               <p>On a commanding site, overlooking a wide expanse of hill and dale, stood a handsome gothic Church, whose gilded cross pointing the boholder to the bright heaven above, proclaimed it of the Ancient Faith of Erin-the Faith, proscribed, persecuted, trampled on for centuries, yet still unharmed, triumphant; coming forth more beautiful and more glorious from every conflict with "the powers of hell;" looking up ever with unwavering confidence to its divine Founder, whose gracious promise-"Lo, I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world!" gleams out in letters of living light through the darkness of successive ages of persecution. Through the open windows of the sacred edifice came the rich tones of the organ, blending with human voices chanting the beautiful Vesper service. Anon, a loftier strain, a swell of heavenly music broke forth, as the organ was tuned to one of those sublime compositions which angelic ministers must have wafted from heaven's own choirs into the souls of the old masters. And as the ravishing harmony arose louder and more exultingly a procession issued from the spacious portal. The sacred emblem of Christianity led the van; next came the white surpliced boys of the sanctuary, surrounding a golden-fringed canopy, beneath which walked the anointed priest of God, clad in gorgeous robes, and reverently bearing the mysterious Host, before whom angels and men bow in adoring love. Then followed a long line of children of both sexes, neatly attired, and bearing baskets, wreaths, and bouquets of<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7227-00000007"/> June's fair blossoms. Passing under a triumphal arch of evergreens tastefully intertwined with flowers, the procession wound slowly around the church-yard, among billows of crimson and white clover blossoms which, rippled by the sweet south wind, sent forth a fresh aroma, mingling with the fragrant incense that rose with every swing of the silver thurible. While the sweet, artless voices of the children chaunted the thrilling strains of the "Lauda Sion," and the birds from their leafy bowers warbled their blithest lays, as if they, too, delighted to celebrate the joyous festival of Corpus Christi.</p> 
               <p>It was a beautiful sight as the little procession with perfect order and decorum moved onward; sometimes in the shadow of overhanging trees, and again in the mellowed brightness of the slanting sunbeams. But ravishing was the spectacle presented when, having re-entered the church, it passed slowly around, among crowds of prostrate worshippers, and up the middle aisle to the sanctuary, which, with its profusion of evergreens, flowers and lighted tapers, was like some fairy scene. The priest having reverently placed the Holy Sacrament on the altar descended the steps, and bowed in humble adoration, and then, while fresh clouds of incense curled gracefully fully around the Monstrance, and the choir chanted the beautiful "Pange Lingua," the children, kneeling before the Sacred Host, presented their floral offering, the pure, fragrant treasures, lovingly gathered from garden, field and forest, which were arranged on steps erected for the purpose on each side of the altar. At that instant the sun sent a shower of golden arrows through the western windows, lighting up with dazzling splendor the altar, now a vast pyramid of flowers and lights. The ravishing notes of the "Tantum ergo," rose on the perfumed air, alternately swelling into exultant strains, and dying away in tremulous melody, the priest chanted in full, rich tones, the prayer of the Blessed Sacrament, and a fresh cloud of incense mingled with a radiant atmosphere. And then followed that interval of impressive silence, broken only by the faint tinkle of the bell, when every head bent to receive "the Benediction" of that God "whose delight is to be with the children of men." Oh! hallowed moment, replete with pure, soul-thrilling blessedness! when, to the spirit still encompassed by earthly bonds, is granted a participation in the happiness of heaven, and the heart throbs and glows with an ecstacy of bliss-a sweet fullness of rapture, never felt<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7227-00000008"/> on earth, save in presence of the "Hidden God who sweetly recompenses the sacrifice of reason to faith.</p> 
               <p>"Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed!"</p> 
               <p>Among the crowd that filled the sacred edifice was one whose knee bent not in adoration, whose head bowed not in loving homage. From a favorable position in the gallery he had watched every ceremony with lively interest, his attention divided between the officiating priest and the devout congregation. When all was over he still lingered, scanning the countenances of those around him, as if to mark the effect produced by the impressive service just concluded; and when he at length left the gallery, it was only to continue his earnest scrutiny of the dispersing multitude in the church yard. He was noticed by many and significant glances and whispers were exchanged after they had passed. Evidently he was known to all there, although no one seemed to recognize him except by an occasional touch of the hat or curtsey, that indicated more distrust than respect.</p> 
               <p>While he still lingered thus the pastor emerged from the sacristy. If the stranger had thought his appearance at the altar peculiarly noble and imposing, no less prepossessing was he now, when, having exchanged his gorgeous sacerdotal robes for the plain black cassock, he made his way slowly between the various groups, a smile of peculiar sweetness lighting up his fine features, as he passed on, with a friendly nod to one and a kind inquiry to another, while all regarded him with affectionate pride, that showed how closely knit were the hearts of the pastor and his flock.</p> 
               <p>On seeing the gentlemanly looking stranger, he approached him with a courteous salutation, which was as promptly returned, and, holding out his hand, said, in a friendly way, "I believe I have the pleasure of seeing the Rev. Mr. Gill-man? I bid you welcome to Bartrymore sir; not that Protestant clergymen are very welcome to Ireland, as a general thing," he added, pleasantly.</p> 
               <p>"But that you make an exception in my favor," said the stranger, delighted with the cordial manner of his new acquaintance, "I esteem it no trifling compliment to be welcomed to Ireland by the Rev. Father Dillon."</p> 
               <p>And the two gentlemen, linking arms as if they were old friends, wandered about the church yard and to the brow of the hill on which it stood; falling into the easy chat naturally suggested<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7227-00000009"/> gested by scenes which had long been familiar to one, while to the other they had all the charms of novelty united to their other attractions. The priest's house adjoined the church; a plains unpretending abode, little better than most of the surrounding cottages, but beautiful from its situation, and from the neat, orderly appearance of the flower-garden, which, though small in extent, presented a great variety of native plants and shrubs, tastefully arranged and evidently cultivated with care.</p> 
               <p>"It affords me an hour's exercise and amusement occasionally." said Father Dillon, in answer to a remark from his companion; "but just now its appearance is not very gay."</p> 
               <p>"It has yielded its blooming treasures for your church decoration," said Mr. Gillman; "really that floral display took me by surprise. The great profusion of flowers, and the taste displayed in arranging them, seem marvelous in a small country town like this. I presume every little garden in the neighborhood was rifled of its sweets."</p> 
               <p>"Most of them are cared for with a particular view to this and similar occasions. And our young folks took long rambles in search of wild flowers; every nook for miles around, I imagine was explored."</p> 
                
               <p>"If they had come to the parsonage, my wife would have been glad to add to their pretty collection," said Mr. Gillman, as he took a seat in the simply furnished parlor. "May I ask the nature of the festival you celebrate with so much care? A holiday of some importance, I judged, from seeing the total suspension of every-day labors."</p> 
               <p>"You were right. The feast of Corpus Christi is a holiday of obligation, and one of the most glorious festivals of the Church. It was instituted by Pope Urban IV., in the thirteenth century, and its office, which is very beautiful, was composed by St. Thomas Aquinas. The General Council of Vienna confirmed it in 1311, as a public protestation of Catholic Faith in the Real Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Holy Sacrament of the altar; and in refutation of the heresy of Berengarius, who was the first to call in question a doctrine which had been held since the apostolic age, not only by the Catholic Church, but by every society which went out from her fold. It is true that St. Irenus speaks of some in the third century who 'denied the Eucharist to be that very flesh which was given for the life of the world;' but their denial was not so much of the Real Presence, as of<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7227-00000010"/> Christ's corporal nature which they refused to believe. In thanksgiving for the wondrous gift, as well as in reparation for the many indignities offered to this Mystery of Love, the festival is annually celebrated throughout the Church on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday, with all the splendor and solemnity that she can command."</p> 
               <p>"This afternoon's ceremony was very fine," said Mr. Gillman. "No one could fail to be impressed with its exquisite beauty. I no longer wonder at the glowing descriptions I now remember to have read of Corpus Christi processions on the Continent."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, but those processions, my dear sir! you cannot form an idea of them from our humble celebration. In Catholic countries where the highest dignataries of the State feel that they are honored in having a place in the procession, which, with all the pomp of banners, music, and military escort, moves in countless numbers through streets gaily decorated in honor of the feast, and among crowds who, with fervent devotion that strikes the most careless observer, prostrate themselves before the Lord of Hosts-a view of one of those processions is something to be remembered forever. Poor Ireland can no longer present one of those thrilling spectacles. All that ardent faith and loving zeal can accomplish, under adverse circumstances, she offers to her God veiled under the sacramental species. But how poor are her celebrations now contrasted with those of former times, how insignificant in view of the sublime mystery that they are intended to honor."</p> 
               <p>"Yet the widow's mite was more valued than the rich man's crown," said the visitor, touched by the mournful expression of the father's thought-beaming eye.</p> 
               <p>"True: and, therefore, our poor land, widowed and impoverished as she is, gives her all, little though it be; humbly hoping that it will be as acceptable as the gorgeous solemn worship she offered in better times, and which more fortunate nations are offering to-day. But, let us quit a subject which would inevitably lead to a controversial discussion," said the father in a lighter tone, and looking at his watch he continued, laughingly, "Now, I am going to invite you to take tea with me, not at my own house, but at my next neighbor's. Nay, never think of refusing-we Irish have queer ways of doing things, you know. I have promised to take tea with this lady-Mrs, Brown is her name-and I will be just <emph>twice</emph> as welcome if I take a friend along.<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7227-00000011"/> And here comes one of her children to remind me of the time:-Yes, my dear, I'll be there immediately. Come, my dear sir, I promise you beforehand a delicious little supper, and a warm welcome from a pleasant hostess; and; if you need further inducement, you will find there the young lady-and a very charming one she is-to whose taste is due the floral display which so much pleased you."</p> 
               <p>And so the English Protestant curate was conducted, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nolens volens,</foreign> to the next house, and duly presented to Mrs. Brown and to Miss Margaret Lynch, the "charming young lady," who was, in truth, a fair specimen of Erin's beautiful, bewitching daughters; and presently he found himself seated at the tea-table, despite his half serious, half laughing remonstrances.</p> 
               <p>"'Tis against all etiquette, I know," said Father Dillon, merrily, "but the fault is mine, not yours, and don't shame me by keeping up the remembrance of it. Mrs. Brown would never forgive me if I disappointed her.</p> 
               <p>"You're right enough there, Father," put in the pleasant hostess.</p> 
               <p>"And how could I do justice to her good fare, after churlishly hurrying away from a friend in order to enjoy it? Now you are in Ireland, you must do as the Irish do, my good sir."</p> 
                
               <p>"If all the duties of my new citizenship prove as pleasant as the first, there is little danger of my proving rebellious," said the curate, who heartily enjoyed the "delicious little supper," at which he was so unexpectedly a guest, find fully appreciated the pleasant companionship to which he was admitted under circumstances that made him feel entirely at home.</p> 
               <p>There was no lack of conversation; each of the four tongues present did its full duty, and was equally ready for lively chat or serious discourse, as occasion offered. The curate was incidentally enlightened on various points which would be useful for him to remember during his "ministry among the Irish." He learned, also, to his surprise, that his bishop, Lord Woolcut, resided on a fine estate in the vicinity of Bartrymore, and not at the cathedral town of --, as he had imagined, and that Lord Woolcut and his son, the rector of the cathedral, spent most of their time in Dublin, with occasional trips to "the sister isle."</p> 
               <p>"I have not yet seen Lord Woolcut," said the curate, "and must own to feeling somewhat anxious to know what manner of man he is. In England he is esteemed very highly; I know not what reputation he bears in his own country.<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7227-00000012"/> Mrs. Gillman has conceived quite a prejudice against him, from the tenor of his brief correspondence. She thinks him haughty, dogmatic, self-sufficient, and so on." An involuntary smile from the priest, and the two ladies caused him to add, in a tone of inquiry, "I hope her preconceived opinion is not a correct one."</p> 
               <p>"My opinion of his lordship might be deemed not quite impartial," said the priest, assuming great seriousness, "so I must decline giving it; though <emph>prudent silence</emph> is a virtue which I do not often get credit for."</p> 
               <p>"Nor can you have credit for it now. Father," roguishly exclaimed Mrs. Brown, "for I leave it to all here if Mr. Gillman has not got a sufficient answer to his question."</p> 
               <p>"It is certainly very easy to 'draw an inference,' even without the aid of the countryman's strong team," replied the curate.</p> 
               <p>"I protest against one being drawn from my innocent remark," replied Father Dillon. "In general I believe a lady's instinct may be relied on-let me finish; you have not caught me yet-this rule, like all others, is subject to exceptions, and every one must decide the exceptional cases for himself. There are subjects on which I am strictly non-committal."</p> 
                
               <p>"O, Father Dillon, your non-committalism is very intelligible!" said Miss Lynch. "Is it not, Mr. Gillman?"</p> 
               <p>"Very; and I am sure my wife would consider it altogether impartial and convincing."</p> 
               <p>The conversation changed to the subject of education, and the curate found that Mrs. Brown and her cousin had charge of the schools connected with Father Dillon's church, which afforded him an opportunity of paying those ladies a well deserved compliment on the deportment of their pupils during the impressive ceremonies of the afternoon. Thus in pleasant chat the time slipped by, and the faint young moon threw her silvery rays across the cottage garden ere Mr. Gillman thought of taking leave.</p> 
               <p>It was a delightful evening. The sky was of the clearest blue, save where a mass of rosy clouds shot with gold, marked the path of the declining sun. Sunset, moonlight and Starlight all combined to shed a luminous radiance, almost too fair for earth, over the hills and dales of Bar-try more. From hawthorn hedge and clover field was wafted an almost overpowering fragrance, steeping the senses in luxurious delight. The insect world was on the wing filling the balmy air with the homely sounds that are so pleasant<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7227-00000013"/> on a summer night; the sonorous hum of the bee-the flutter of the moth's bright wings as they dashed among flowers and shrubs-the piping of quails from the cornfields-the croaking of frogs from the marshes-all blent pleasantly enough with the rich voice of the cuckoo-the merry song of the distant waterfall-the gleeful tones of children at play in their door-yards.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Gillman paused at Mrs. Brown's door, to admire with the others the heavenly beauty of the hour, laughingly saying that he believed he had scarcely expected to enjoy an evening so dry and balmy in a land that had acquired a reputation for continual rains and excessive moisture.</p> 
               <p>"Rendering it only fit for cattle raising," added Father Dillon: "You remember the anecdote of Dean Swift, when, on hearing an English lady remark that the air of Ireland was remarkably salubrious he fell on his knees and besought her not to say so in England or they would certainly tax it. Unfortunately his advice to keep 'mum' on that point, was never heeded; so the air of Ireland, if not subject to taxation, pays the penalty for its provoking salubrity in being artfully slandered."</p> 
               <p>"Your reverence has taken quite a fancy to the new curate," said Mrs. Brown, when Mr. Gillman had taken leave of his three entertainers, with warmly expressed wishes on both sides that the acquaintance thus begun might ripen with lasting friendship.</p> 
               <p>"I have indeed," was the reply. "I consider him an upright, conscientious, honorable gentleman, and have no fear that he will pursue those proselytizing practices of which Bartrymore has lately been the theatre."</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid he will not be here long," said Miss Lynch.</p> 
               <p>"You think he will weary of his small flock?</p> 
               <p>"Not so soon, perhaps, as his lord bishop will weary of him."</p> 
               <p>"There is danger of that," said the Father reflectively. "I should be sorry to see him dismissed from his new charge."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <head type="sub">The Parsonage and its Inmates.</head> 
               <p>BACK from the main street of Bartrymore, shaded by a double row of patriarchal trees, stood the Protestant church, as it was mostly designated, its original appellation of "St. Bridget's Chapel" savoring too much of the old religion to please those who, in the early times of "Ireland's conversion from Popery," had become its proprietors, under the standard rule that "might makes right." A picturesque edifice, half shrouded in ivy, its quaint architecture and venerable aspect telling of the olden times-its only modern appendage being a bright weather-cock, (meet emblem of the Re-formers' changeable creed,) which, having supplanted the time-honored symbol of Christianity, now glittered from the graceful, tapering spire that peeped out from among the clustering trees.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely a stone's throw distant, in the midst of a garden that was one profuse tangle of roses, lilacs and sweet brier, nestled the parsonage-a snug, old-fashioned building, with small, latticed windows, and a wooden porch, overhung with honeysuckle and jasmine. The whole place had a comfortable <emph>home</emph> look, quite cheering to the new curate, whose prospects had been very gloomy since his unceremonious dismissal from his charge in England, to make way for a new favorite of the dean's.</p> 
               <p>The Rev. Walter Gillman was not what is called an eloquent preacher; neither could he enact the part of a mountebank, to make himself popular, or draw a congregation by advancing startling "theories" spiced with just a little touch of profanity or infidelity. He was simply what Father Dillon, with his quick insight into character, had read, a sincere, earnest, conscientious man, devotedly attached to the religion which he believed to be the true one; and strict in the performance of his duties as one of its ministers. But the time for such has gone by. What congregation can submit to the <emph>bore</emph> of an old-fashioned, plain-spoken, faithful clergyman, in this era of progress and sensation? Mr. Gill-matt had neither the desire nor the power to "improve" himself according to the popular standard, and he was also without influential<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7227-00000015"/> connections, so that his chances of a call, in these days of brisk competition, were decidedly few. After a period of anxious suspense, he reluctantly followed the advice of his practical wife, and advertised. This advertisement meeting the eye of Lord Woolcut, procured him the curacy of Bartrymore. The salary of seventy-five pounds per annum was rather small for the support of a wife and four "olive branches," but the parsonage, with a good bit of ground attached, was rent free, and, as nothing better was likely to offer, the parson concluded to accept it, an additional inducement being that a teacher was wanted for the female school belonging to the church, and that Mrs. Gillman's sister was both competent and willing to fill that post.</p> 
               <p>Friends in England learned of their intended removal with dismay, and contrived to work upon the fears of Mrs. Gillman with so many terrible "instances of the wild, revengeful temper of the West," that she secretly regretted an undertaking which now seemed a rather desperate adventure. But she was not one to put her hand to the plough and look back; she would go through with it, let the danger be what it might. And, as she told her sister while they were busily preparing for removal, she would not shrink from accompanying her husband whereever he thought his duty called him, if it was even on a missionary expedition to the South Sea Islands.</p> 
               <p>Clara Hudson laughingly answered, that "it was lucky his views of duty did not carry him so far; it was just as well to stop within the bounds of civilization, and, though the wild Irish 'of the west' <emph>might</emph> be demi-savages, there was no danger that they would take a fancy to serve tip little Benny as a dainty roast." And as she spoke she pressed warm kisses on the dimpled cheeks and fat white shoulders of the baby, whom the mother had snatched up in a vague feeling of alarm. "Never fear, Em," said she, with a merry burst of laughter, "your husband's new parishioners are not the cannibals of the South Sea."</p> 
               <p>"No, of course not," said Mrs. Gillman half ashamed, "but then, Clara, there <emph>were</emph> dreadful things done in Ireland during the famine a few years ago. It was even said that mothers ate their own children-a thing I never <emph>could</emph> credit, though Lady Edwy assured me the other day that it was true; and that, as well as she could remember, it was in ' the far west' that such barbarous deeds wers committed. She thinks it<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7227-00000016"/> dreadful to live in the midst of such people; though she did not recollect hearing that such barbarities had occurred in Bartrymore."</p> 
               <p>"The barbarity," said Clara, warmly, "was on the part of those who, while surrounded by every luxury, could suffer their fellow beings to be reduced to such extremities. We, English people, should blush to think of that famine, Emily."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it was very dreadful. I am glad to remember that Walter did what he could, and got maney of his congregation to contribute liberally towards the relief of the suffering people. But, do you know, Clara, that I think the Dean was never so friendly with him since? However, he did but his duty as a Christian, and if others did'nt like the contrast between his humanity and their want of it, the fault was not his. There, I think that china will go safe now-I would'nt have it broken on any account."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman was naturally a shy, timid woman, easily alarmed: strong only in her affections, and in the tenacity with which she clung to what she deemed right, and abhorred what she deemed wrong. It was not wonderful, then, that the tales of famine, horrors and agrarian outrages, her kind friends related for her encouragement, should make some impression on her mind, and dispose her to regard the new sphere of duty as a very trying, if not dangerous, one. But her natural good sense soon regained its supremacy, and by the time her journey ended, she had almost forgotten her silly fears, and was quite ready to make the best of every thing, according to her usual habit. She was charmed with the beauty of her new parish, delighted with the picturesque church, and well pleased with "the simple, honest, good natured peasantry," so different from the savages-half civilized, but altogether lawless-whom her friends had described. The parsonage, to be sure, was not equal either in size or conveniences to that which she had inhabited since her marriage. But, if the rooms were small, there were plenty of them; and when carpets had been laid down and curtains hung up, the furniture, which had luckily escaped injury, arranged in proper style, and household affairs moving in the old system of order and regularity with which the neat servant she had brought from <emph>home</emph> was so well acquainted-the good lady set herself down in her new abode with a quite-at-home feeling she had not dreamed of enjoying.</p> 
               <p>The new curate was not so well satisfied, for he already began to have misgivings as to the<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7227-00000017"/> success of his mission in Ireland. His congregation was so inconsiderable as scarcely to deserve the name, and he saw no probability of enlarging it by conversions. For Bartrymore was not like a town in his own country, with dissenters, unbelievers, and persons calling themselves Christians, yet attached to no particular Church. Here, save the few Protestant families composing his flock, the people were all Catholics, and the imposing ceremonies of Corpus Christi, the evident fervor of the congregation, and devotedness of their pastor, allowed him little hope of making converts among them.</p> 
               <p>As he walked homeward from Mrs. Brown's his mind was disturbed by this and similar reflections. It had not escaped his notice that he was regarded with suspicious distrust by the people generally-a feeling sufficiently accounted for by the accounts he had already received of his predecessor's bigotry and intolerance. This, of course, made his own position more difficult. And the thought of the Lord Bishop added to his uneasiness. His English bishop, whom he had seldom seen during all his ministry, was remarkable for an easy, careless disposition, not troubling himself or his subordinates by an excess of zeal. Mr. Gillman, faithful and exact in the discharge of his duties, had sometimes wished that his bishop was a <emph>little</emph> more interested in the cause of religion. Henceforth he would not have occasion to indulge that wish. Lord Woolcut evidently inclined to the other extreme, and would probably be exacting to an unpleasant degree. Altogether, his situation promised to be a trying one.</p> 
               <p>On reaching the parsonage he found his wife and sister-in-law enjoying the beauty of the evening in the vine wreathed porch, and chatting with the sexton and his son, (who was teacher of the boys' school,) while the children played merrily in the old-fashioned garden. It was a pretty domestic scene, and, tranquilized by its influence, Mr. Gillman gave an animated account of the manner in which he had spent the afternoon. The ladies joined in his wish that they had been with him, but Mrs. Gillman added that she would be rather shy in going to a Catholic church, as ministers' wives were subject to so much criticism; her curiosity might be thought unsuitable by some of her husband's parishioners. The two Egans agreed with her, and it was plain they thought their parson's curiosity unsuitable. He was conscious of this, but merely remarked that he was sorry he had not gone in the morning,<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7227-00000018"/> as he fancied the priest was an eloquent preacher, but that he would take advantage of some other holiday to hear him. He then spoke of the two ladies who had promised to call soon at the parsonage; and expressed his conviction that they would be very agreeable acquaintances.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman, who had been used to a large circle of friends, and had not yet seen any one in Bartrymore whom she, was willing to consider in that light, was much interested, and applied to the sexton to know "who they were"-a question satisfactorily answered.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Brown was the widow of a gentleman who had held some important office in Dublin-Mr. Egan could not remember exactly what it was. The widow, finding her income insufficient to support her in the manner to which she had been accustomed, removed to Bartrymore with her two children, then mere babes, and took up her abode with her uncle, Dr. Lynch, who was a widower with one daughter, at that time absent at a Convent school. Soon after Miss Margaret had finished her education and returned home, the Doctor died, leaving her a sufficient annuity. It had always been her intention to become a sister or a nun, Mr. Egan did not exactly know which; but the priest persuaded her to remain awhile in Bartrymore, and assist her cousin in a school she had lately established. The priest, Mr. Egan had heard, intended to have good schools under the charge of some religious orders as soon as his means would allow: meantime as a work of charity, the two ladies taught the poor children of St. Patrick's gratuitously. They were also very good to the poor, and were thought everything of in Bartrymore-the sexton somewhat grudgingly added.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman was quite willing, after this account, to make the acquaintance of the Catholic ladies. Just now her mind was taken up with an invitation herself and husband had received to visit the lord bishop the next day. His lordship would send a carriage to convey them to the "Episcopal Palace;" a very kind attention on the part of Lord Woolcut, of whom she was now disposed to form a more favorable opinion, while speculating as to what kind of a place he he had, "Not so fine as Lord Edwy's, of course."</p> 
               <p>"Much finer, from what I have heard," said the curate.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman smiled incredulously: she could not believe that any place in Ireland was equal, much less superior, to Lord Edwy's domain.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A Visit to the "Episcopal Palace."</head> 
               <p>THE Episcopal Palace was built against a mountain slope, commanding a full and extensive view of scenery that would have driven an artist wild with the vain ambition of transferring it, in its own matchless coloring, to canvass. The broad, island-dotted Lough Carrib, now sparkling in the sunlight, now darkening with the shadows cast by the sunlit hills of lar Connaught-the fine oak woods towering aloft in regal grandeur-the bold outlines of Croagh Patrick, here lighted by a golden ray, and there veiled by a fleeting cloud-the ruins of an ancient abbey, over whose desolation nature had kindly woven a veil of moss and ivy-each put forth its peculiar claim to the spectator's admiration, and all combined to form a landscape of such wild, picturesque beauty as only "the West" could boast.</p> 
                
               <p>The home of the Protestant Bishop was well worthy its surroundings. The lofty, turreted building which formed the central portion, was a splendid specimen of the elaborate architecture of former ages; the wings, of modern construction, had been built so as to harmonize with the massive strength and dusky magnificence of the original building. From the castellated front a lawn of the richest sward, ornamented with clumps of shade trees and blooming shrubs, fell away with a long, gentle slope; bounded on one side by a magnificent park stretching away for miles until lost in the distant woods; on the other by a succession of terraced gardens, with fish ponds, gothic arbors and glittering conservatories. With its thousands of broad acres, taking in a good part of the picturesque town of Bartrymore, and the village that lay behind the piled up hills forming the boundary of the garden, a princely estate was this of Lord Woolcut "Bishop of-and Peer of the Realm." Truly if his sacerdotal office was but a shadow-a mockery-its accompaniments were splendid realities.</p> 
               <p>Indescribable was the amazement of the parson's wife as the carriage containing herself and husband wound slowly through the park; at<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7227-00000020"/> times descending into a deep glade whose twilight gloom was vocal with the songs of the thrush and the blackbird, and fragrant with the breath of the sweet brier; again emerging from the shade, and winding up a pleasant height, where, through the foliage of wide-spreading beeches and lordly oaks she caught occasional glimpses of the glorious scenery around.</p> 
               <p>"Who would ever dream of such a place in Ireland?" she exclaimed frequently, in a low tone, as if a loud word would have been a desecration of the place. "Why, Walter, Lord Edwys place is nothing to it!"</p> 
               <p>But when the stately palace came into full view her exclamations ceased; wonder and admiration were too deep for words. She could only gaze with a sort of incredulous rapture, that was soon disturbed by a feeling of nervous dread. How <emph>could</emph> she face the owners of all that grandeur? If, yesterday, the honor of a visit to "the Lord Bishop" had, seemed <emph>almost</emph> overpowering, to-day it was quite so. How she longed to be once more ensconced in her humble home! Had they been on foot she would have resolutely turned homeward, leaving Walter to make such excuses as he might for her absence but this was prevented by her being in the bishop's op's carriage; how hateful it was to her now! There was nothing for her but to go through the dreadful ordeal, so the little woman, with a shrinking dread such as not all the tales of "the wild Irish" had excited, resigned herself to her fate. Her husband vainly tried to re-assure her. His cheerful remarks were only answered by a look or slight motion of the head.</p> 
               <p>As they entered the great hall her heart gave a sudden bound, then sank like lead, leaving her pale, nerveless, ready to faint. Mechanically she followed the liveried servant into a room, where, in some way, she knew not how, she went through the ceremony of introduction to Lord Woolcut and his daughter. The sound of rushing waters was in her ears, and a mist obscured her sight, as she sank into a seat beside the window, replying in a husky tone to the polite observations of the Hon. Miss Woolcut. Presently, to her great relief, the latter turned her attention to the conversation going on between her father and the new parson; when, revived by the cool gushes of air that fanned her throbbing temples, Mrs. Gillman took courage to look around, remembering that Clara would be sure to ask for a description of the room. To her simple mind its magnificence could scarcely be surpassed,<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7227-00000021"/> even at Windsor Castle, yet it was one of the plainest apartments in the house, being the one in which those visitors were received whom it was desirable to place on a half familiar footing. It was situated in one of the wings, and had bay windows looking into the beautiful garden, with its back ground of hills. The paneling of dark oak, lighted up by several fine paintings; the carpet, soft and thick as wood-moss; tables and cabinets of precious woods, rich with carving; chairs and sofas luxuriously cushioned; there was enough to engage Mrs. Gillman's attention for hours, without taking into account a partial view of the library adjoining, with its rich hangings and book-cases of elaborate workmanship. At length her eyes turned curiously on the owners of all this magnificence.</p> 
               <p>Lord Woolcut was a man advanced in years, with a full, ruddy-colored face, rather heavy in expression at full view, but, when turned aside, the stern, almost classic severity of outline, the stately curve of the brow, the perfect form of the large, full gray eye, the firmly compressed lips, all inspired the beholder with a feeling akin to that which is felt in contemplating the profile of one of the old Romans. One would scarcely believe, at such times, that nature had adorned the casket more than the gem; yet his lordship possessed no transcendant gifts of head or heart, and his peculiar characteristic was an obstinate bigotry, which revealed itself at all times and under all circumstances.</p> 
               <p>The Hon. Miss Woolcut closely resembled her father in many respects. There was the same sternness of profile, the same grandeur of forehead, the same large gray eyes, perfect in form and color, but with no depth or softness of expression to relieve their cold, searching glance. In person she was tall and queenly, with an unmistakable air of high breeding in the regal poise of her well-shaped head, the slow grace of every motion, and the serene composure, which no shock slighter than that of an earthquake could possibly disturb.</p> 
               <p>There was another person present; a pale, ladylike woman, who sat in a recess partly hidden by the window drapery, with her eyes sedulously bent on her embroidery. This was, as Mrs. Gillman conjectured, Miss Woolcut's former governess, who, since the death of Lady Woolcut, had exercised a general supervision over the affairs of the household, and was an occasional companion for her former pupil. The kind heart of the parson's wife felt much compassion for this<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7227-00000022"/> forlorn person, who was evidently accustomed to remaining "in the shadow," and this feeling aided her to overcome the awkward embarrassment of which, on Walter's account more than her own, she felt heartily ashamed.</p> 
               <p>But her presence seemed quite forgotten by the trio who sat at a little distance, discussing schools, charities, and other matters pertaining to the new parson's charge. She felt somewhat proud that several suggestions of her husband seemed to meet the approval of the Lord Bishop, who always turned with stately courtesy to his daughter for her opinion of matters which certainly interested her as much as any thing could. Mrs. Gillman, who, despite her national reserve, was apt to indulge in vulgar enthusiasm on occasions, mentally designated the lady a statue, and became quite irritated at the sound of the low, clear voice, which, whether uttering approval or dissent, never varied in the slightest degree from its calm monotone. She was beginning, too, to feel rather hurt at being so entirely overlooked; but just then Miss Woolcut drew near with her stately grace, and, sinking into a chair close by, began to make inquiries as to her health, her family, how she had borne the journey from England, how she liked her new abode, &amp;c.</p> 
                
               <p>The visitor, priding herself on being strong and "wholesome," was quite taken aback by the insinuation that her health had suffered from the wearisome journey: for to this cause Miss Wool-cut chose to attribute the faintness which had happily passed away, as she knew it would by a few moments of perfect rest and quiet. This was said in a manner to imply an apology for having so long left the visitor to herself; but Mrs. Gillman felt sure that those cold gray eyes had fathomed her mental distress; and, unused to the tact of polished society, was provoked by this interruption, of her embarrassed deportment; in her estimation it was downright hypocrisy, culpable disingenuousness-and in a bishop's daughter, too! So, being, as she was wont to say, "a plain up-and-down person, without affectation or hypocrisy," she made no effort to be agreeable to her hostess, but maintained her part of the conversation in the fewest words possible.</p> 
               <p>She was wishing that her husband's business with the bishop would come to an end, when, to her dismay, a servant announced luncheon, throwing open the door of a small room where a table was spread with what she deemed a sumptuous dinner, rather than a mere lunch. She had<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7227-00000023"/> no appetite just then, and her admiration of the beautiful decorations of the room, and the richly chased silver and cut glass sparkling on the table and sideboard, rendered her almost unmindful of the dainty fare so exquisitely served. And her nervous trepidation returned every time she was addressed by his lordship, whose formal, ceremonious manner was poorly calculated to set her at ease, and whose cold, scrutinizing glance she shrank from encountering. Presently, to her relief, he addressed himself to her husband, resuming the conversation that had been interrupted by the summons to luncheon.</p> 
               <p>"So you have but one fault to find with your new charge, Mr. Gillman, and that, if I may inquire?"</p> 
               <p>"Is the paucity of numbers," replied the curate, with a smile, "I must confess having been most disagreeably surprised when I found on Sunday morning that my own family and the sexton's comprised a large part of my congregation; fully one-third, I imagine; and at afternoon service the attendance was even more slim."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to hear this, yet scarcely surprised," said his lordship, "for of late the congregation has been gradually falling off. It is a sad change within a short period. The last time I visited that church the pews were pretty well filled, the people seemed very attentive to the service, and ten or twelve presented themselves to be confirmed, which was all very satisfactory, as you, sir, may imagine. Indeed, it was the most pleasant day I spent during my 'visitation;' quite consoling in every respect."</p> 
               <p>"I am sure of it," replied the curate. "It fully recompensed your lordship for much care and anxiety."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my!" thought the curate's wife, "how <emph>can</emph> Walter speak so? As if <emph>he</emph> ever felt any care, except for himself-pshaw!"</p> 
               <p>"But is it possible," continued the curate, that there has been so great a falling off within a year! Truly, a sad change, as your lordship observed."</p> 
               <p>His lordship reflected a moment; his daughter recollected some events that had occurred about the same time, and it was thus found that more than two years had elapsed since the consolatory visit.</p> 
               <p>"Last year," resumed the bishop, "there were no candidates for confirmation. I was some what disappointed, but Mr. Miller (who was then the curate) made a long explanation, which I deemed satisfactory; but I have since learned<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7227-00000024"/> that he was mistaken in many of his views and expectations."</p> 
               <p>"One part of his explanation seemed quite clear," said Miss Woolcut. "During the previous Lent several priests from England (Jesuits, I believe,) had conducted some special services at the Popish chapel, and by all accounts the exercises of this 'spiritual retreat,' as it was termed, were so captivating that really it was not strange that many of our poor converts, led thither by a fatal curiosity, lost the light of gospel truth and relapsed into their old superstitions."</p> 
               <p>"A very natural consequence," said Mr. Gillman. "Those retreats seem to be of the same nature as the 'revivals,' so popular with the Methodists. Enthusiasm misleads the judgment; excited feeling is mistaken for religion. But the effect is generally transient, and the converts 'backslide' after the excitement subsides."</p> 
               <p>"So Mr. Miller anticipated," said Lord Woolcut; "but the reaction he so confidently predicted never took place. On the contrary, those who left us at that time have since helped to delude others, and the result, as you have seen, is almost an empty temple of worship. I rely upon you to bring back the wanderers, Mr. Gillman. The work will require all your energies, for you have a wily and untiring foe in the Roman priest-Father Dillon, I think, they call him; but the victory when gained will be all the more glorious."</p> 
               <p>"I shall endeavor to fulfil your lordship's expectations," said the curate. "At least I may safely promise that no effort on my part will be wanting; but you know, my lord, 'Paul planteth, &amp;c.,'" he added with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly-most undoubtedly. But rest assured, my dear sir, success is rarely denied to well-directed, persevering energy. Of this our opponents furnish sufficient truth. We know that God's blessing doth not rest on their labors, that He gives not the increase-yet they are wonderfully successful everywhere, and why? Simply because their whole souls are in their work. They labor with a zeal and self-denial that would be truly apostolic if exerted in the cause of truth, to promote the interests of their church; they are ready to encounter every difficulty, to surmount every obstacle, to endure every privation, rather than fail. Would that a similar spirit reigned among our clergy! Its happy results would soon be perceptible."</p> 
               <p>"Are you not rather severe upon our ministers, papa?" said Miss Woolcut. "Doubtless<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7227-00000025"/> there are some of them devoid of the spirit which you eulogize, but there must be many who are laborious and zealous, though having more difficulties to contend with than the Romish clergy, and lacking those adventitious aids which contribute not a little to their success."</p> 
               <p>"Granted, my daughter. The severe simplicity of our faith appeals not to the ignorant masses like the gorgeous but unmeaning pageantries of the Church of Rome. Ours is a religion of the reason, not of the imagination. But, conceding this, it is still certain that a great deal can be done by vigorous and judicious action; and I must repeat that I hope much from Mr. Gillman's ministry at Bartrymore. I have the interest of that district peculiarly at heart, sir; and, should you succeed in permanently establishing the Reformed Faith in that benighted region, you will entitle yourself to my warmest gratitude."</p> 
               <p>A <emph>cold</emph> reward enough, Mrs. Gillman thought. The imperious bishop began to assume the character of an exacting task-master in her eyes, and she felt provoked by her husband's quiet reply, intimating due appreciation of the confidence his lordship was pleased to entertain of his zeal and abilities.</p> 
               <p>Miss Woolcut next expressed her opinion that in such a parish as his very much depended on the schools; an opinion in which the curate was happy to coincide. Upon which his lordship proceeded to expatiate on what he "hoped" from the Bartrymore schools. Mr. Gillman could not assent cordially to all his views, but was quite ready to admit the necessity of training the children of the peasantry in institutions where the errors and superstitions of Romanism would be gradually eradicated from their young minds, and 'pure gospel truths' implanted instead. Then even if the adult population persisted in their errors, through the force of habit and early prejudices, the progress of truth would become manifest as the rising generation advanced to maturity.</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to find you taking such a practical view of the subject," said the bishop. "To speak candidly, our expectations of progress in this neighborhood are founded mainly on the schools. With the majority of the adults your zealous efforts will, I fear, prove fruitless; <emph>but the children! They,</emph> at least, shall be brought to the knowledge of the true religion. Every means must be resorted to in order to induce a large attendance at the schools. If gentle methods fail, we shall not hesitate to use harsher ones. The parents<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7227-00000026"/> must send their children to be properly instructed. If any refuse they shall be driven forth, (as far as <emph>my</emph> power and influence extend,) and their places either be left desolate or be filled by others more tractable."</p> 
               <p>The curate's wife turned on the <emph>Christian</emph> bishop a look of incredulous horror. "But the poor people-what will become of them?" she asked hastily. "Surely your lordship would not leave them without shelter!"</p> 
               <p>What a beaming glance was that which Walter Gillman gave the true hearted wife, whose womanly feelings, triumphing over her natural timidity, enabled her to fix her honest, earnest gaze unshrinkingly on the great man whose glance she had not hitherto dared to meet. There was deep silence for a moment after that unexpected "intervention."</p> 
               <p>Then his lordship replied, in his accustomed tone, "We are merely supposing a case, Mrs. Gillman. It is not probable that there will be any occasion for resorting to a measure which has, unfortunately, incurred your disapproval."</p> 
               <p>The sarcasm was quite thrown away upon its object, who was now "done with the lord bishop," as well as with his honorable daughter, Henceforth she would never think of him without out picturing to herself the "driving forth" process so coolly spoken of. She gave no further heed to anything that was said, ceased to notice the occasional remarks of Mrs. Wood, (the quondam governess,) save in the coolest manner, and only breathed freely when once more in the carriage, with her back turned to the elegant mansion, which, as she emphatically told her husband, she had seen for the first and last time.</p> 
               <p>And thus terminated the important visit in which neither party had made a favorable impression. Lord Woolcut pronounced the new curate an opinionative man-a fault which his lordship only tolerated in himself-well disposed, doubtless, and willing to perform the duties of his office, but only in his own way; it remained to be seen whether that way was a good one; his lordship doubted it, but would give him a fair trial. In this opinion his daughter fully concurred; she had noticed this <emph>peculiarity</emph> in the Rev. Mr. Gillman. As for his wife, she was summarily dismissed from consideration, with the brief verdict of "a vulgar, disagreeable sort of person," "very ill-bred, indeed!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman's opinion of her "superiors" was not to be summed up so briefly. It took her a full hour by the clock to make her sister acquainted<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7227-00000027"/> quainted with what she thought of Miss Wool-cut. And as for the lord bishop-words failed her in describing him. Domineering, cruel, tyrannical,-pshaw, how inadequate were such epithets! If it was not for the respect due to him as bishop of the diocess, she could easily tell <emph>what</emph> she thought of him. "And there was Walter, talking so smoothly, and agreeing to whatever his lordship chose to say!-it provoked her to see a man not having an opinion of his own, or, if he had one, not presuming to declare it."</p> 
               <p>"My dear," said the amused parson, "would you have had me commence a controversy with his lordship on subjects of which I,' a stranger in a strange land,' know little, if anything? Would he care the snap of his finger, think you, whether I saw the wisdom or humanity of his various measures, or was blind thereto?"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman did not choose to respond; so, woman-like, started on a new tack.</p> 
               <p>"Whatever on earth did you find to talk about so long with him, and that inanimate 'piece of goods,' his daughter?"</p> 
               <p>"Church matters in general and parish affairs in particular; more especially the education of the children, to promote which, as you afterwards wards learned, they are exceedingly anxious. And there was much to be said respecting a certain Miss Clara Hudson, principal-elect of the girls' department. Said department being under the patronage of the Hon. Miss Woolcut-('Oh, Clara! burst from Mrs. Gillman in a tone of utter dismay)-she is naturally very deeply interested in its welfare--('As if <emph>she</emph> could be interested in anything!' muttered Mrs. Gr.)-and has the moral and intellectual advancement of the pupils much at heart;-Aye, if she <emph>has</emph> a heart!-'she has devised various plans for increasing the popularity and consequent usefulness of the school, which have been approved by her noble father, the bishop, as also by her honorable brother, the rector-('It's to be hoped he's like them-there <emph>ought</emph> to be three such Solomons in the world!')-but has never been so fortunate as to meet with any curate willing to co-operate in carrying out said plans." ('Good luck to them for <emph>that,</emph> whoever they may have been!')</p> 
               <p>Mr. Gillman and Miss Hudson could no longer restrain their laughter.</p> 
               <p>"Why, sister, you are learning to speak <foreign xml:lang="FRA">a la</foreign> Irish," said the latter merrily. "But, really, I fear a visit to our bishop is not at all improving to one's temper or manners, judging by its effect on our dear Emily."</p> 
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7227-00000028"/> 
               <p>"I know," said Mrs. Gillman, "I shall feel out of sorts for a week to come. Clara, there is no use in your undertaking that school. You'll have to give it up. Why, I would'nt be concerned in anything <emph>she</emph> has to do with for all the money in the Bank of England,"</p> 
               <p>"But you won't be concerned in this, sister mine, and I fancy I shall get along very well with this formidable patroness."</p> 
               <p>"Don't flatter yourself with such expectations, Clara. I will tell you just what you will find her to be-"</p> 
               <p>"O, I beg of you let us be done with her for to-day. Don't make my trial any harder by prepossessing me against the lady, Em; that is not kind in you."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, joke over it while you can; you will soon find it no laughing matter. I am sure I pity you and Walter," continued the little woman, looking compassionately from one to the other; "it is horrid to be obliged to please or try to please, I should say, two such-bears, I was <emph>going</emph> to call them; but then bears, if they are cruel, do not act the hypocrite, and-"</p> 
               <p>"O, Emily! what are you saying? Is this your respect for the bishop of the diocess?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't care a fig what he is. I should like just to give him a piece of my mind. After all, my first opinion of him was right."</p> 
               <p>"You have done that already, my dear, and a very considerable 'piece,' too, I imagine," said her husband, laughing heartily; "so rest satisfied. Where did you get so much courage, little wife? It was; truly 'bearding the lion in his den' to find fault with one of his lordship's pet plans. Poor Mrs. Wood looked as terrified as if she were beside some wild animal just breaking loose from its cage."</p> 
               <p>"Poor creature! She looks as if she would not dare to say her soul was her own if the bishop chose to claim it; for that matter, I believe he <emph>does</emph> claim to own both souls and bodies of those who are in, any way dependent on him."</p> 
               <p>"O, Emily! Emily! you are incorrigible!" said her husband, as he retired to his study.</p> 
               <p>"And you are as much disappointed in them as I am" said his wife.</p> 
               <p>An assertion which the new curate could not gainsay.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter">

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">The Schools.</head> 
               <p>IF the new curate had been surprised at the smallness of his congregation, not less so was the new schoolmistress when she beheld the few scholars who seemed almost lost in the spacious room allotted to the Girls' Department, in the handsome building which had been erected without regard to expense for "educational"-<abbr>i. e.,</abbr> proselytising-"purposes." Her duties as <emph>teacher</emph> were no way onerous, for the majority of the pupils consisted of infants of four or five years, to whom two Paid Monitors gave instruction in the alphabet; while of the larger girls very few were advanced beyond the Second Book. Accustomed to teach in a "Young Ladies' Academy, where the "ologics and accomplishments" were the only branches to which the pupils devoted their time? the young English lady found the Model School of Bartrymore a very trifling affair. No opportunity tunity was afforded to try the comparative value of old and now systems; she was obliged to let things go on in the ordinary routine of the Primary School, annoying and tedious beyond description to one accustomed to teach the higher branches of learning.</p> 
               <p>"Yet for this, as for most of our trials, there is a compensation," she said one evening, when conversing with her sister and the curate. "Those Irish children have a natural 'smartness,' as the Yankees say-a turn for study really astonishing. They are easily roused to ambition, and incited to take an interest in their tasks, and are always ready to listen to illustrations, explanations and definitions, which they readily comprehend, and of which, I verily believe, they would not weary all day long. Our English children may make more solid progress; but they are wanting in the quickness these children manifest, as well as in the hearty interest they take in learning."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman, who, with all her good qualities, was intensely English, and religiously believed in the vast superiority of "the Saxon" over all other races in every respect, thought Miss Hudson's observation was very odd, and was still more struck when the curate said that he had<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7227-00000030"/> noticed the same thing in his frequent visits to the "Boys' Department."</p> 
               <p>"If I were a teacher," he added, "I should prefer Irish boys to English as pupils; they are so impressible and enthusiastic. Touch their fancy, excite their imagination, and you can mould them as you will."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman thought that in any case she should give the preference to her own people.</p> 
               <p>"Not if you were a teacher," said her sister. "You cannot think, Emily, how refreshing it is, in the monotonous routine of teaching, to meet with this quick perception-almost intuitive, it seems; and then the enthusiasm so quickly excited, and sometimes in a manner that seems incredible. To give an instance: The other afternoon I was reading the beautiful description of 'Evangeline,' in my favorite poem, when school re-assembled. With some reluctance I laid aside my book, when one of the larger girls, attracted, perhaps, by the handsome binding, begged of me to 'read for them out of that book.' Read Longfellow for an audience like that! The idea was laughable. But I saw that the whole class had assumed an attitude of attention in anticipation of a treat, and as I never like to disappoint a reasonable expectation, I complied, and read aloud the lines that were still lingering in my memory, with such other passages here and there as I deemed most suitable. Emily, you should have seen those children! Little creatures, who could not possibly understand the poem, listened with an eager desire to know what it was about; and several of the older ones hung upon every word with breathless interest, their eyes sparkling with delight at some lines of rare beauty, and filling with tears when I read any pathetic passage. I would not have believed such a thing possible. Glancing up from time to time, I found their interest unabated; and when at length, with a guilty consciousness of 'wasting school time,' I closed the book, their faces were clouded with regret. One awkward, uncouth-looking creature, drew a long breath, as if released from a spell, and came to my desk with wonderful boldness (for she is very shy of the teacher), to ask me earnestly 'if I would'nt read some more of it another day.' I asked her if she liked it, when, to my increased amazement, she answered, 'I could hear to it all the day, ma'am. Isn't it jest like the sound of the organ at High Mass, that carries ye out of yerself, till ye trimble and cry, but can't tell what for?' When I promised to read some every day as a reward for those who<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7227-00000031"/> attended to their lessons, she turned abruptly and addressed the school something in this way: 'Girrils, listhen, will ye? The misthress will be readin' some of that grand poethry for us ivery day if we mind our books.' I could no longer refrain from laughing. <emph>That brogue,</emph> combined with the relish for the exquisite poem, was irresistible. However, I endorsed the promise, and you would have thought I had promised those peasant children some rare treat. Now imagine a similar scene in any common school in England. Nay, imagine the cultivated young ladies of Mrs. Bell's Academy listening to Longfellow: What dull looks and distressing yawns-what restless motions and impatient whispers. Perhaps out of the whole number six or eight would be attentive. In my poor Irish school there were not more than that many inattentive, and they were of the baby class."</p> 
               <p>"You remind me of what I felt a few weeks ago when I went to St. Patrick's Church," said Mr. Gillman. "It was on the festival of the Assumption, as you may remember. I have already told you something of the ceremonies, &amp;c.; but what I never can describe-though I shall always recollect it-was the eager and intelligent interest with which that congregation of poor, uneducated men and women listened to Father Dillon's sermon. It was the most thrilling sermon I ever heard, abounding in poetic passages and beautiful imagery. In language that seemed almost inspired, he pictured the life of the Virgin of Nazareth, blending all that is told of her in the bible with the various traditions of his Church, until he presented her enthroned as Queen of heaven and earth, and appointed by her divine Son the dispenser of all His graces and blessings to the children of earth, each one of whom He had addressed from the cross when saying to St. John, 'Behold thy Mother! It was such a sermon as one of the ancient fathers would have preached, full of eloquence, the eloquence alike of the head and the heart, awakening the most varied and lively emotions. Truly an intellectual treat, such as I had never enjoyed before, but one which I would not have deemed the majority of the worthy priest's auditors capable of appreciating."</p> 
               <p>"Neither were they," interrupted his wife; "I suppose not one in twenty understood him It is a great pity to have such gifts wasted on a congregation like his."</p> 
               <p>"You would not deem them wasted had you been present, Emily."</p> 
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7227-00000032"/> 
               <p>"You judged the people by yourself, Walter, and thought all must feel as you did."</p> 
               <p>"So they did, but much more deeply," replied her husband, with a smile, "for while I was only captivated by the eloquence with which he invested a theme that to me seemed quite absurd, they believed it, and must consequently have found the sermon more impressive. But, like Clara about Longfellow's poetry, I felt how un-suited such a strain of eloquence and lofty thought would have been to a similar class of hearers in England. And, on the other hand, how unacceptable to an audience like Father Dillon's would be the coarse, common-place harangue which we went to hear one night in London, and to which thousands of the lower and middle classes of Londoners listened with admiration and interest. I remember being surprised at the remark of an Irish laborer which I overheard in passing along the street the next morning. His companions were speaking of the popular preacher, when Pat interrupted them with an air of impatient disgust. 'I heerd him last night-is that what yez call fine praiching in England? Bedad, if he was to set up for a great praicher in Ireland we'd <emph>laugh</emph> at him.'"</p> 
               <p>"I have no doubt of that," said Clara.</p> 
                
               <p>"Well," said Mrs. Gillman, laughing, yet a little piqued, "all that I can see is that you are both bent on making the Irish appear a superior race."</p> 
               <p>"Come, come, Emily, don't be so unreasonable. Has not each nation some peculiar characteristic? And why should we feel chagrin or vexation because Heaven has seen fit to endow the Irish with a warm fervor of fancy-a poetic temperament-above other people? Shutting our eyes to the fact will not make it cease to be one. I have lately given much thought to this subject, believing it to have an important bearing on the work in which we are all deeply interested. Every day serves to make it more clear to my mind that, until these prevailing characteristics of the Irish are considerably modified, their conversion to Protestantism in large numbers is impossible. Individual conversions will, of course, be made, but very few in comparison with the population."</p> 
               <p>"Then why is such strong encouragement given to the people of England to contribute to the church mission in Ireland? You know, Walter, that it is firmly believed there that the Word of God is being gladly received in Con-naught."</p> 
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7227-00000033"/> 
               <p>"Yes, and that there is a necessity for erecting large and commodious churches without delay to accommodate the converts. But, my dear, assertions are not always to be credited. It may be that the people who write those encouraging reports of the spread of Protestanism in Connaught believe what they assert. 'The wish is father to the thought' with many persons. For myself, with every desire to see the cause of truth progressing, I am compelled not merely to doubt their accuracy, but to disbelieve, in toto, those glowing accounts in which I used to place implicit confidence."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman looked troubled. If her husband was correct, those glowing accounts were nothing but falsehoods-artful, unblushing impostures-her candid, straightforward disposition could apply to them no milder name; yet how could she thus designate "reports" emanating "from the highest and most unquestionable sources?"</p> 
               <p>"Judging by our own experience, I cannot see that the state of affairs is at all encouraging," said her sister. "To be sure the Bartrymoreans are not as reserved and suspicious towards the Protestant minister and his family as they seemed at first; but the change, I imagine, is due simply to Father Dillon's friendly manner to him, whom he styles his esteemed antagonist."</p> 
                
               <p>"How different he is from what I had imagined an Irish priest to be," said Mrs. Gillman. "I would never take him to be one."</p> 
               <p>"He is a most agreeable acquaintance," rejoined her husband; "lively and entertaining, without any approach to unelerical levity-person with whom one can converse with the freedom and unreserve which constitute the charm of social intercourse."</p> 
               <p>"I like him especially for one thing," said Mrs. Gillman. "He never seems to wish to enforce his religious views or opinions on others. I used to be in agony whenever he dropped in (as he says) in a friendly way, for fear he would attack me on the subject of religion; but I believe he never thought of such a thing."</p> 
               <p>"Then that was the reason why you used to take so little pleasure in the good priest's visits! I agree with you that nothing was farther from his thoughts, probably, than such interference. He never seems to think of the difference in creed or clime, unless an opportunity offers to make some pleasant <emph>hit,</emph> which he is just as well pleased to have returned."</p> 
               <p>"O, yes, I would never think of finding fault with him in that. He is one to 'give fun and take fun,' and you always know how to get along with such a person."</p> 
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7227-00000034"/> 
               <p>"Now it is my turn to say something in praise of the 'Romish priest of Bartrymore,' as Mr. Egan "persists in calling our good friend," said Clara; but you have left nothing for me to add, unless I say that teacher and scholars are equally delighted when he visits our school; he is so lively and full of anecdote and wit, and yet has the most cunning way imaginable of drawing from every thing some useful moral for the children. They esteem his visits as a great compliment, especially as he does not go to the boys' school. I often hear them boasting that 'the Father would'nt go near the boys-he just comes to see Miss Clara and <emph>us!</emph>'"</p> 
               <p>"I don't think it is fair or liberal in the priest to refuse to visit the boys' school, because their teacher's father turned from the Catholic religion, and brought his children up Protestants, which certainly was a praiseworthy thing in the old man. Why should Father Dillon refuse on that account to have anything to do with the school or the teacher? I am sure we are all Protestants, and yet he is as friendly with us as need be."</p> 
               <p>"He makes a great distinction, my dear wife. He does not deem those who are Protestants by birth and education responsible for their erroneous roneous faith; but old Egan turned Protestant not through conviction, but because he thought it more respectable and more likely to advance his interests. At least so Father Dillon thinks, and I am inclined to agree with him, for the sexton troubles himself very little about religion. I doubt if he ever says a prayer, and I know it would puzzle him greatly to tell what the Episcopal Church teaches or what she condemns."</p> 
               <p>"For all that he was right in renouncing an erroneous creed, Walter."</p> 
               <p>"Granted. But I confess that I should prefer conversions made through an intelligent conviction that our religion is the true one. The priest, however, assures me that conversions from his church are always made through motives of worldly gain, or through repugnance to the strict rules of the Catholic Faith. What do you think of that doctrine, ladies?"</p> 
               <p>"Margaret Lynch holds the very same. She insists that no Catholic ever yet left the church through a sincere, heartfelt conviction that he or she was adopting a purer Faith, or becoming more acceptable to God."</p> 
               <p>"Very complimentary that to those whose ancestors left her church," said the curate's wife.</p> 
               <p>"So I told her, and affected to be quite offended<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7227-00000035"/> fended; but she insisted that I was not, and had really no cause to be, for such apostacy was <emph>fashionable</emph> at the time, and, of course, commendable-just like the bold robberies and piracies to which so many noble houses in Europe owe the ancestral honors that their scions proudly wear."</p> 
               <p>"What a comparison," said Mrs. Gillman. "But, Clara, Miss Lynch never talks to me in that way. I always find her very agreeable; and Mrs. Brown also. Indeed I like them both very much."</p> 
               <p>"So do I," said her sister " and not the less from having frequent passages at arms with them, about our respective creeds and climes; for I do like people to be sturdy defenders of their own side of a question. By the way, Margaret and I had a hearty laugh to-day about my poetic readings."</p> 
               <p>"I hope you are not so foolishly indulgent as to keep your promise to read poetry for those peasant children, Clara?" interrupted her sister.</p> 
               <p>"Surely you would not have me break it, sister Emily; that would be giving them a rather bad example, would it not?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, you would not exactly break your promise; they would never think of it again if you did not remind them of it."</p> 
                
               <p>"But, indeed, they do remember it, Emily. As regularly as school closes each afternoon they make ready to hear 'the mistress read,' and surely it would be a cruel thing to deprive them of what affords so much gratification. But as I was about to tell you, this afternoon as I was reading my usual three pages in 'Evangeline,' Margaret Lynch ran in, being in haste, as usual, to get at work on her wax flowers. When the children had left the school room, curious as they always are to know what will come next, (for the interest of most of them in the poem is unabated,) she picked up the book, as if in amazement, and said very seriously, 'I wonder if Miss Clara Hudson knows what she is doing? Such a book read in <emph>this</emph> school? It is incredible.' I felt a little proud of my pupils as I answered that probably she thought as I did at first that it would be all Greek to them, but that on the contrary they understood it very well. 'I know it,' said she, 'and that is just the reason that I wonder at your reading it for them.' I stared at her in astonishment, not knowing what she could deem objectionable in my favorite poem. At last she said, as demurely as ever, 'The idea of <emph>you,</emph> who have been installed here as promoter of Lord Woolcut's plan to convert the children<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7227-00000036"/> of Irish Papists to Protestantism, introducing a volume like this, with its touching pictures of what the 'Papists' of Nova Scotia once suffered from this same Protestantism.' I could not help laughing at her manner. The objection had never occurred to me; but I told her, in extenuation of my thoughtlessness, that the children would not understand for what cause the poor Acadians had been persecuted. As if I won't make it my business to tell the tale at catechism,' said she, 'and several of your scholars belong to my class. Oh, it is too good a joke-I must stop and tell Father Dillon as I go home what appropriate reading Miss Hudson chooses for her school.'"</p> 
               <p>"She ought to have started at once with the good news," said the curate.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps she would if it were not for her haste to get her wax flowers begun. But we had some merriment over our work at what she was pleased to call my lamentable breach of trust, and especially in fancying what Miss Wool-cut would think if it came to her knowledge."</p> 
               <p>"I think she would forget her stately composure on such an occasion, and condescend to be highly displeased."</p> 
               <p>"Very likely," was Clara's cool reply; but if she is patroness of the school, I am mistress. The lady understands that full well, for she has seen that I can be as decided and resolute, in a careless way, as herself."</p> 
               <p>"It perplexes me how you can get on with her so well," said Mrs. Gillman.</p> 
               <p>"The explanation is very simple, Emily. She saw from the first that I would not permit any interference in my management of the school, and though I do not flatter myself that I have risen in her estimation by this course, still it has had the effect I wished."</p> 
               <p>"But she often visits the school!"</p> 
               <p>"O yes, and on such occasions is always received in the most polite and respectful manner, of course. So is his lordship, when he deigns us a visit. And they both express themselves highly pleased with the improvement of my scholars. Sometimes his lordship expresses a regret that the attendance is not larger, in which I sincerely concur; then he consoles me by an assurance that in gaining the affection of my pupils, I have done a good work, the result of which will be evident after a time, in the growing popularity of the school. So you perceive, Emily, we are on most amicable terms."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman's countenance expressed her<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7227-00000037"/> pleasure. She was quite proud to think that Clara managed so well to be independent of Miss Woolcut's influence in school affairs. So were the pupils, which was one cause of the teacher's popularity with them, and with the peasantry in general. For, the haughty, reserved manner of the great lady had not won for her either respect or affection from the poor people of Bartrymore, and it was delightful for them to find that the school mistress "did not let herself be put upon by Miss Woolcut;" to be "able to hold her own with the proud daughter of his lordship," was no slight recommendation with his tenants and laborers.</p> 
               <p>Miss Hudson devoted herself faithfully to secure the intellectual progress of her pupils. As to their religious education, it was conducted with what the noble patrons would have thought a reprehensible liberality. The Bible was read, of course; but those children whose parents were unfortunately blind to the superior merits of King James' version were at liberty to use their own, or to dispense with scriptural tasks altogether: the teacher being so far behind the age as to imagine, that there were better modes of in stilling a love for religion into youthful minds and hearts, than that of compelling them to commit to memory "chapters of the Bible." Mr. Gillman frequently gave religious lectures to the school; so did Father Dillon; both the reverend gentlemen confining themselves to subjects suited to the capacity and wants of their young auditors.</p> 
               <p>The ladies of the parsonage and those of the Catholic school were on the most friendly terms, visiting each other frequently, and holding long and earnest consultations about the various matters, great and small, which absorb so much of time and thought in every family. And Miss Lynch gave Miss Hudson some useful suggestions about her school, and received some new ideas in return, which she found applicable to her own. The former taught her new friend gold embroidery-a sort of work in which she was unusually proficient from working various articles for the Church-and learned in return to make wax flowers in the most beautiful manner, an art hitherto unknown in Bartrymore, and to which the afternoons in Clara's school were devoted, to the intense delight of her pupils. Every one, even to the smallest, took part in the work, and the result of their industry was a superb basket of flowers, a Christmas gift from the school to its patroness, who was vastly pleased thereby, as was also her father. Margaret's flowers were<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7227-00000038"/> intended for the altar of St. Patrick's, and formed a very attractive part of its Christmas decorations.</p> 
               <p>Altogether it was a peaceful time in Bartrymore. The reign of Bible "readers," ranting "soupers," and all their fanatical crew seemed at an end.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <head type="sub">Reminiscences of the Famine.</head> 
               <p>MRS. Gillman, as in duty bound, hated idle gossip; but yet the desire to know something of one's neighbors is natural; and, coming to a land where the people and their ways were as strange to her as if they belonged to another world, she felt a very pardonable curiosity to learn something of them. To gratify this was easy, through the medium of Nancy Boyle, who came once a week to the parsonage in the capacity of laundress, and at such Other times as extra help was needed. Nancy was a rather good looking woman, whose hearty laugh and genial voice the curate's wife liked to hear, though the <emph>brogue</emph> was rather perplexing at first-she was not quite sure that she understood it right. But, when a woman, anxious to obtain information, meets with another equally anxious to impart it, there is little doubt<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7227-00000039"/> about their coming to a mutual understanding: so Mrs. Gillman soon learned to comprehend "Nancy's brogue," and acquired a very respectable stock of information, regarding the people of Bartrymore. This she of course generously retailed to the family circle, so that the curate was wont to congratulate her on the recurrence of washing and talking day, (forgetting the many hours <emph>he</emph> spent in similar chat with the sexton and school master.) Once he contrived some errand to the wash-house, where he beheld Nancy in her glory, lathering and rubbing away, while her tongue went in a manner that would put to shame the disbelievers in perpetual motion; and the mistress listened with unwearied interest, while doing up the fine things which could by no means be intrusted to other hands. The curate thought that this was an ingenious excuse for her presence in the wash-house; but he was a prudent man, and took care not to put the monstrous idea into words.</p> 
               <p>"There is a boy goes to the school that interests Mr. Gillman greatly," said the lady on one occasion. "He is a 'paid Monitor,' I think; a <emph>very</emph> clever youth, Mr. Gillman says, and one who will get along in the world. His knowledge of the Bible is quite extraordinary."</p> 
                
               <p>"I know who you're meaning, ma'am; its Bob Costhello, isn't it?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, that's the name, Robert Costello. The school-master says Lord Woolcut is delighted with Robert's aptitude for learning, and especially his fondness for the sacred Scriptures, and takes a warm interest in his progress-so the lad's fortune is as good as made."</p> 
               <p>Nancy's brow clouded, and the suds fiew about in an unwonted manner. "Yes," she muttered between her teeth, "without doubt the villain's fortune's made," and the rest of the sentence was lost in her abrupt fling of the clothes into the boiler.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman would have been no woman, had not her curiosity been stimulated by this. There was evidently "a story to tell"-consequently a story to hear; so Nancy, although evidently reluctant to continue the subject, was overcome by the "mistress's persuasions," and with a sigh began:</p> 
               <p>"It's a sore heart I have whenever I think of them Costhellos. That boy's mother and myself were like two twin sisters, from the cradle up; though we were neither kith nor kin, and that's a thing I've been thankful for this many a day, though many a time <emph>then</emph> I wished it otherwise.<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7227-00000040"/> Poor silly creatures that we are! little we know what we're wishing for half our time, and it's a mercy that we don't, nor what's to come upon us, and upon them that's dear to us. Norry Blake (as her name was then) was as purty a girl as you'd want to see, wid eyes as black as midnight, and the light in them like the stars; and cheeks as bright an' as smooth as the leaves of a red rose. But why do I talk? Sure you've seen Robert, and he's the image of her-only he's gettin' a look upon him this while past, that's not like any <emph>she</emph> ever had-but when he was younger and innocent, he was as like the mother as one side of a body's face is to the other."</p> 
               <p>"Robert is a very good boy," said Mrs. Gillmoan, who understood, more by the tone than the words, that Nancy was casting some reflection on the best scholar in the bible class. "Of course, when a youth is advancing to manhood, his features change a good deal; and for one of seventeen or eighteen, Robert is well grown and manly looking."</p> 
               <p>"No doubt," rejoined the washer-woman, who wouldn't contradict, but would by no means change her own opinion. "He's <emph>forward</emph> an' manlike beyond his years, 'tisn't to-day nor yesterday he got so. Well, as I was tellin' yer ladyship, Norry Blake was a beauty when she stood at the altar to be married to Andy Costello; a handsome young boy he was, too, and what was better, a good one, but none too good for Norry. A happy couple they were, an' though they lived in a thatched cabin, never a house in the land was tidier, or cleaner, or purtier to look at, for Norry could turn her hand to any work, an' she always wanted every thing about her bright an' snug. An' Andy was a sober, industrious boy as ye could find, an' brought home his earnings regular as the day. Norry's father an' mother were with them <emph>they</emph> live in the same cabin yet, across the mountain yonder-it's a lonely place, but maybe that same makes it better for them now. She was all the child they had livin', an' they just doted on her, an' little wonder was there in that, when she was the talk an' the delight of all that looked on her. So, time went on, an' things were all right with them, an' Norry was a happy woman an' a proud one, when she went to Mass on Sundays an' Holydays with her husband, an' her ould parents, all so respectably clad, an' her children rosy wid health an' neat as hands could make them. Didn't I love to look at the darlints? 'Twas little less proud of them I was than herself, more betoken two of them was my own that I stood for at the font."</p> 
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7227-00000041"/> 
               <p>"Then I suppose Robert is your god-child?" said Mrs. Gillman, as Nancy paused with a long-drawn sigh.</p> 
               <p>"No, then, he isn't!" she replied, almost fiercely; "Glory be to Him who took the ones I loved best from this world of wickedness and woe! <emph>They</emph> have their place forever an' ever among the angels at his blessed feet, an' with them my own four darlints that I see often an' often in my draims-praise be to God that I can see them <emph>then.</emph> Oh!" she added, with a wild burst of grief, "many's the salt tear I've shed for them, but I've lived to thank God that He took them to Himself, while they were innocent an' fit to be in His holy presence; an' still-miserable creature that I am!-even while I'm thankful-an' that I am, as <emph>He</emph> knows-still I must make my moan when I look around an' miss them all from my side-the weeny darlints, that I loved as only a mother can."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillmore's eyes moistened, but deep as was her sympathy, her surprise was yet greater. This was the woman who had seemed to her a hard-working, honest creature, without a thought of care, always ready to talk and laugh, and, when left to herself, forever crooning some old Irish ditty, as if she had never known a sorrow; this the woman whose careless lighthearted temperament had sometimes excited her pity-at other times her envy. Like all of her nation, she began to find these Irish incomprehensible-these "simple creatures," who, when their self-constituted judges think they understand them well, suddenly appear in a new light, putting to flight all the wise theories of superior minds.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman sincerely pitied the childless mother, but ere she could decide how to show her sympathy most acceptably, Nancy came to her relief by quietly resuming her work; her voice still faltering as she apologized for her "tediousness."</p> 
               <p>"I'm come now to the part of my story I don't like to think about, much less to tell," she resumed mournfully, "an' yet there's hardly a day I rise off of my bed that I don't think of it. The time of the famine come, I've told you some-thin' about that before, but oh! ma'am dear, who can ever tell you of it as it ought to be told! O, them dark, sorrowful days! can I ever forget them? When Dennis an' myself were strivin' to earn somethin' to keep the breath in the poor children, that we would lay down our lives for; an' they pinin' away-the four darlints-an' goin' one after another from our arms to the cold<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7227-00000042"/> grave; and when the last of them was gone, Dennis just took me to his heart, an' we cried an' begged of the Lord of glory to take us along wid them. But it wasn't His holy will; for though the sickness fell upon us; an'-Heaven be merciful to us both-we never tried to get well, but hoped we were done wid the hard world that wouldn't spare enough to keep the life in even one of our weeny darlints-still we lived through it. We lived through all the sorrow and want an' sickness; how, neither of us could tell if ye were to give us a room full of gold for the tellin'-no more could any of the others that was brought alive through that time of woo. 'Twas the will of God, maybe, that some would be spared-there's no counting for it else.</p> 
               <p>"But Norry! my poor Norry! how can I bear to tell of her? Want pressed her sore, as it did the rest; but, maybe, it went harder wid her than wid others, for she was always delicate-like, for all she was so stirrin'; an' so the parents an' the husband always petted her as they would a child. An' maybe the right sense left her when she saw her baby fade away and draw its last breath. It was the first of them to go, for the starvin' mother had no milk for it, but others soon followed, 'till at last there was only the one girl left-my own Mary-and this Robert. An' Mary was down wid the sickness, and so was the father, strong man as he was, he was now weak and helpless as any infant, with fever burning up what little of life watf left in him; as for Norry and the ould folks they had little heart or strength to nurse Andy an' the child Mary, an' neither food nor medicine to give them."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Nancy, this is heart-rending to think of," said Mrs. Gillman, sadly.</p> 
               <p>"It is, ma'am; then, what must it have been to see it wid one's own eyes? And still there were some-aye, plenty of them-that saw it all, saw more than tongue can ever tell; an' without havin' their hard hearts melted at the sight, when-But Lord save us from judging them! It isn't for us to sit in judgment on them that oppressed the starvin' poor."</p> 
               <p>"But such people were a disgrace to humanity, Nancy. Their cruelty should not have been allowed."</p> 
               <p>"True for ye again, ma'am, but who was to hinder? Sure they were the rich, an' the great, an' them that was in power. Not all of them, thank God, not all! But them that was willin' to give, an' did give, as far forth as their means would allow, what could they do among so many,<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7227-00000043"/> when the ones that was best able to help stood aloof. There was Mister Miller that had the same place Mister Gillman has now. Sure it was in his power to save hundreds, for he had the ear of Lord Woolcut an' of plenty others that would give through him or through his wife when they wouldn't through another; but never a morsel of bread nor a drop of medicine either of them gave except to the poor creatures that bartered their souls for it. Whoever promised they'd come here to church, <emph>they</emph> got enough to keep them living,' for mighty sorry he'd be to lose one of his <emph>convarts;</emph> an' woe's me to tell of it, he had a lot of them at last, for when the worst come an' there was no chance at all for them, some of the weak creatures were ready to listen to his smooth talk, an' sell their souls for what would keep the life in them.</p> 
               <p>"I'm not meaning any disrespect to your church, ma'am," Nancy went on, as she saw Mrs. Gillman's cheek flush hotly. "Like enough its dear to ye; an' his reverence, beyond a doubt, would like to gather a big congregation around him, but he'd never value the conversions that was made through hunger. <emph>He'd</emph> never be the one to say to the starvin', 'Come to my church, an' I'll give ye a crust, or a bowl of soup, but if ye remain Papists I can do nothin' for ye.' Its not yer husband, ma'am-blessins on his kind heart an' on yer own as well-that would be actin' as Parson Miller an' most of his cloth did at that time."</p> 
               <p>"He would scorn such wicked meanness," said Mrs. Gillman, indignantly. "How could any Christian man or woman act so barbarously?"</p> 
               <p>"Then, many a man an' woman was found to do it, and a great name they earned wid some for their zeal, but as for being Christian, we won't trouble them wid the name."</p> 
               <p>"But I wonder that many were found to accept aid on this condition, Nancy, so attached as the Irish are to their religion, I should think it would be impossible-but I can't tell-"</p> 
               <p>"No more you can't, ma'am; it's hard to tell what we'd do till the trial comes I'm not excusin' or defindin' the renegades-God forbid that I should, for their sin was an awful one. But just think how 'twould be with ye, ma'am, if you was to see the children that ye'd give yer heart's blood for, wastin' away to skin an' bone before yer eyes; wid their little faces so pinched wid the want an' the cold, turned on ye so sorrowful like, axin' for the bit or the sup ye hadn't to give them; an' maybe an ould father or a tender<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7227-00000044"/> mother to the fore, an' hunger an' misery joining hands wid ould age to hurry them all the faster away from you to the grave-think what a sight to be lookin' at day after day, an' no hope of relief but the one the tempter held out An' so 'twas no wonder, though sin an' shame, that many who'd go through fire an' water for the Church, (an' there's no true Irishman or woman that wouldn't) at this time forgot their duty; an' among the rest my poor Norry an' all belongin' to her, at least it was said that Andy died a Protestant; but each time Father Dillon went to see him, he found him ravin' mad wid the fever, and so it was with him, some folks said, up to the very minute of his death. Anyhow the minister claimed him for his convert, an' Norry had nothin' to say agin' it; so he buried him in the churchyard up here-where no one belongin' to him lay-an' preached over him, 'tis said, a grand sermon, tellin' all about his conversion, an' how happy he was in dyin' to think he'd come to the knowledge of the gospel, an' so on; the sermon lasted for an hour or more, an' how much truth was in it was best known to the parson himself. An' the same way he did over little Mary; though she was too young, the darlint, to understand his talk about religion. He used to sit talkin' to her by the hour, an' I've not a doubt that she listened to him mild an' dutiful-like, for she was always a mannerly child. But how much she was <emph>convarted,</emph> might be known by her axin' Mrs. Brown to say her beads for her, an' them was amost the last words she spoke; an' to the last she kept a fast hold of the little red beads that his Reverence had given to her only the Christmas before-'twas Mrs. Brown herself that told me, an' sure she wouldn't put a turn in it."</p> 
               <p>"I don't believe she would," said Mrs. Gillman; " but how happened it, Nancy, that you were not with your friend Norry-"</p> 
               <p>"An' so I would, ma'am," interrupted Nancy; "but all this happened at the time of my own trial, when I wasn'nt able to do any good for myself, let alone another. "Twas I that was grieved to the heart when I come to find how it had been wid the Costhellos, an' to think <emph>my Mary</emph> wasn't layin' in consecrated ground along wid her four brothers and sisters. I was wild when I heard of it. Och, if I had been about at the time, no parson would have-" Here Nancy checked herself, in deference to her auditor, and added, with a sigh of resignation, "'Tis little differ', after all, where we're put, I suppose, if the soul goes right, an' her's went straight to glory-the purty, innocent little darlint!"</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7227-00000045"/> 
               <p>"So the help came too late to save the poor woman's husband or child," said Mrs. Gillman, mournfully.</p> 
               <p>"Too late to save either of them, or to save poor Norry herself. She was weakened down by sorrow an' want; an' now, havin' no peace of mind, (for how could she have it?) she wasn't able to gather strength; though, to give the parson an' his wife their due, they saw that she had every attention paid to her; but 'twas all no use. She kept on her feet for a time, but had no longer heart for anything; 'twas seldom she spoke to her ould parents, an' as for others, no word, good, bad or indifferent, could they draw from her: she just looked at them as if she didn't know they were talking,' wid a hard, cold stare in the black eyes that used to be so soft an' so sparkling'; an' soon she took to her bed an' never riz from it again. Father Dillon went more than once to try to bring her back to the church she had unfortunately strayed away from; an' sure if anybody could do anything wid her, he could, wid his kind, fatherly way, an' the blessin' that Heaven gives to his labors; but she never seemed to mind him, only looked at him in that strange way, an' he said-God bless him! 'tis always the good word or the charitable excuse he has for every one-he said she was out of her mind, an' like enough she was.</p> 
               <p>"I mind well the last time I saw her," resumed Nancy, after a long pause. "I was weak an' tremblin', for 't wasn't long after I riz from the bed of sickness, an' I hadn't yet been outside the door: but somebody told me that Norry was dyin'-the doctor said she had not many hours to live-an' dyin' out of the Church! that was hardest of all, I got one of the neighbors to help me along, an' went every step of the way to her cabin, prayin' I might be in time, for I thought the ould love that was between us would help me to win her back to the right way. They said she would not know me, but she did-as I knew she would-she knew me the minute I took her hand to kiss her, an' for a time she looked at me wid somethin' of the old look-'twas all that was left to make me know she was the same-for oh! she was changed in every feature, an' nothin' left of the handsome, bloomin' face I remember so well. Ah, we were all changed, every man an' woman of us, by that time of woe, but Norry worse than all. But I saw that her heart was still the same, an' oh! didn't I plead wid her, an' beg her on my bended knees to think of her poor soul, an' let his<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7227-00000046"/> Reverence come to prepare her to meet her God! But, woe's me! the only answer I could get from her was 'too late! too late!' an' the look that she gave me when she said it I can never forget. I never saw her again, for the sorrow an' the disappointment together was too much for me, weak as I was. I fainted dead away alongside of her, an' they had to get me home the best way they could. Before I was able to leave the house again, it was all over, an' Norry was buried wid her husband an' little Mary in the churchyard there beyond-my own, own Norry that I loved! an' I can't even say 'God be merciful to her soul!'"</p> 
               <p>At this point Nancy, who with difficulty Controlled her emotion thus far, broke down completely, and gave way to a vehement and long continued burst of grief. At length looking up with an air of mingled timidity and defiance, as if expecting that she had excited the scorn of her auditor by her closing regret, she saw with surprise that she and her sister, who had joined them some time previously unperceived by Nancy, had been silently weeping with her. "The Lord bless you for them tears!" she exclaimed, her own falling again, but with a calmer flow, at the unexpected sympathy. "You know nothing of this trial, ladies, but oh, 'tis the hardest of all trials. There's comfort in prayin' for the dead that none but a Catholic can know. To think that you can still do somethin' for them that's gone from you, and carried half your heart away wid them-that ye can relieve them if they're in punishment waitin' an' sufferin' till they be purified from the last defilement, an' made worthy to dwell forever wid the Lord of glory-to know that you can pray for them as often as you will, an' offer up in their behalf a fast or some good work, which He, who is all mercy will accept in His great goodness, an' shorten by so much the time of their banishment-isn't this a great comfort to the broken-hearted and the sorrowful? praise, honor an' glory be to Him that taught His Church the doctrine of purgatory an' prayer for the faithful departed. 'Tis a grand thing, ladies, but oh, it is a sad thing, an' a heart-breakin' grief, when them you love, has put it out of your power to help them after death, by dyin' in a state of sin! Then, they're not among the faithful departed-you can do nothin' for them, an' this is the sore thought for a Catholic to feel."</p> 
               <p>"I can imagine something of it," said Mrs. Gillman, "for though I do not believe that prayer can benefit the dead, still it is a pretty doctrine, and a consoling one to those who believe in it."</p> 
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7227-00000047"/> 
               <p>"For my part," said Clara, "I believe it, and think it a great pity that the Reformers did not include it among the articles of faith. I often envy Catholics the exclusive possession of this most beautiful and touching doctrine; and I know if I were one, this is the tenet to which I would cling most tenaciously."</p> 
               <p>"May the Lord grant you the comfort of understandin' an' believin' all the doctrines of the Church, Miss Clara," exclaimed Nancy fervently, her broad, good-natured face all aglow with pleasure, and her eyes glistening through their tears. "'Tis myself that would like to see you a Catholic, an' a good one you'd be, I know. Faith, I believe you'd soon come up to Miss Margaret herself, an' sure she's a saint all out. 'Tis pleasant to see the two of you so often together, an' do you know, Miss, I think you're very much alike."</p> 
               <p>"O thank you-thank you a thousand times, Nancy," said Clara, laughing pleasantly. "One must come to Ireland if one wants pretty compliments, I see. Do you know that in all the time I spent in my country, I don't think I received so many compliments as you have contrived to pay me now."</p> 
               <p>"Why, then, that was a shame for your country-people, an' showed their want of taste an' good manners," said Nancy, joining in the laugh; "but never fear that you'll be in want of compliments from this out. Everybody is sayin' 'twas a bright day for Bartrymore when it first saw you, not forgettin' Mister Giliman an' the mistress here as well. Very little we guessed what sort of ladies we were goin' to have, an' as for the gentleman-long life to him!-he surprised us entirely."</p> 
               <p>"I believe <emph>that,</emph>" said Mrs. Gillman, smiling.</p> 
               <p>"Why, then, you may believe the rest as well," interrupted Nancy.</p> 
               <p>"O, I <emph>may</emph> think some of your compliments unmerited, you know; but from all I hear of my husband's predecessor, I can easily imagine that you looked forward with something of dread of what the new curate might prove, and have been agreeably disappointed in him."</p> 
               <p>"That we are," said Nancy, with emphasis. "There's scarce one to be found in the place that wouldn't speak up for him, if need were: in fact, they all think there's but one thing wantin' to him."</p> 
               <p>"What is that?" Mrs. Gillman put the question with some anxiety.</p> 
               <p>"An' that is to be a Catholic, instead of a Protestant, an' the same to ye all."</p> 
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7227-00000048"/> 
               <p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Gillman, laughing, yet a little vexed, "I might have known that you would say that."</p> 
               <p>"What else could I say, ma'am? Ask who you will, from the priest down, an' you'll get but the one answer, that they wouldn't have his Reverence other than he is, save in that one thing."</p> 
               <p>"They are not likely to be gratified, Nancy."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, <emph>I'm</emph> not sure of that-the Lord has His own wise ways of bringin' things about."</p> 
               <p>"Very true; but suppose He should not wish to bring this particular thing about?" said Mrs. Gillman, much amused at Nancy's earnestness. "I really think you will all have to be good enough to like Mr. Gillman as he is, though, of course, your wish is a very good one as <emph>you</emph> understand it, and we're very much obliged to you for the kind feeling that dictated it."</p> 
               <p>"You're welcome to it, ma'am, an' to our prayers as well. Arrah, Miss, don't you be lookin' so roguish an' so unbelievin' like. Do ye think we're so remiss in our duty as to neglect prayin' for our benefactors? I didn't think ye had such a poor opinion of us, Miss Clara, dear."</p> 
               <p>"But praying for your benefactors has nothing to do with your praying for us," laughed Clara.</p> 
                
               <p>"Hasn't it, then? We're the best judges of that, wid due respect for you, Miss. 'Twas no longer ago than last night that I heard a prayer, and indeed more than one, uttered for a certain young lady that broke the fall a little child was gettin' down a hill. That same child would have its bones broke or be killed outright, maybe, if it had rolled off of the hill in among the rocks an' slates at the foot of it, an' nothin' was to hinder, only the lady goin' by that had the foresight an' the courage to grasp the child when another minute would be too late. You wouldn't tell me, Miss Clara, that the mother wasn't prayin' for her benefactor when she asked the blessed Mother of God to reward her who had no thought of danger to herself, or of damage to her elegant clothes, or of anything on earth to save the poor dirty ragged gossoon, that most ladies would pass by without mindin.'"</p> 
               <p>"They'd be monsters, unworthy the name of woman," said Clara, whose color had heightened considerably during Nancy's narration.</p> 
               <p>Just then Mrs. Gillman, who had been absent in the kitchen, returned.</p> 
               <p>"Now while I think of it, Nancy," said she, "was it during the famine time that old Mr. Egan-our sexton, you know-became a Protestant?"</p> 
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7227-00000049"/> 
               <p>"O no, ma'am, 'twas several years before that that he turned. The old villain hadn't that excuse. It wasn't that made him forsake his church; but he thought it more respectable-like to be a Protestant An' Mister Miller encouraged him, of course, an' like as not promised him the place of sexton; anyway he got it soon after turning, an' has held on to it ever since. He was a tailor before that."</p> 
               <p>"His wife died several years ago, I understand."</p> 
               <p>"She did, ma'am. Poor creature! she had a hard life wid him, for he's a cantankerous sort of man as ye'd find, though you may not think it, for he's very mealy mouthed an' submissive in the presence of his betters."</p> 
               <p>"No wonder the bishop is partial to him," whispered Mrs. Gillman to her sister.</p> 
               <p>Nancy, not hearing the whisper, went on. "Yes, his poor wife had a sad time of it, an' I believe she was not sorry when her time come to leave this world."</p> 
               <p>"But on her children's account?" suggested Mrs. Gillman.</p> 
               <p>"Well, ye see she had no more control over them than anybody goin' along the road. He petted them an' punished them just accordin' to the humor he was in; she dare not do either; if they did the best thing in the world is wasn't for her to praise or reward them, nor to check them, if they were goin' wrong. The mother was nothin' to them, the father every thing."</p> 
               <p>"I don't like him altogether," said Mrs, Gillman, " but his son seems to be a fine, steady young man."</p> 
               <p>"The schoolmaster you're meaning, ma'am? Then I doubt but he's the worst of the two, for all he's so mild and smooth-spoken."</p> 
               <p>Clara laughed; the schoolmaster did not stand high in her estimation evidently. Mrs. Gillman gave her a warning look, for imprudent as she was apt to be in speaking out her opinion, she had an idea her sister was still more so. To change the subject she referred again to Norry Costello, and Expressed her satisfaction that one of her children was spared, and was likely to be a useful member of society.</p> 
               <p>"I differ with you, sister," said Clara. "I think Robert Costello is the worst boy in the school, or in the town either, by what I know of it's boys."</p> 
               <p>lf Give me you for judgment," chimed in Nancy, heartily. " You lee, Miss Clara, the boy is unknown to Mistress Gillman, an' she judges of him by what the schoolmaster says, an'-"</p> 
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7227-00000050"/> 
               <p>"Not exactly, Nancy. I judge by what Mr. Gillman tells me, and he has a high opinion of the boy."</p> 
               <p>"Formed upon what the teacher and the sexton say," rejoined Clara. "The youth seems fond of study; other merit than that I really think he has none. He is not truthful, as the elder Mr. Egan, with all his partiality, is obliged to admit."</p> 
               <p>"He has not admitted it to my husband, for that one trait would suffice to make any youth odious in his estimation."</p> 
               <p>"In his capacity of Monitor," continued Clara, "he is very domineering over the boys; not rough or impatient with them, as one would think, from his age. He has rather the cool malice and unrelenting severity of the old style pedagogue."</p> 
               <p>"Quite a pleasant picture," said Mrs. Gillman, laughing. "You are sure you have not put in too much <emph>shade,</emph> Clara."</p> 
               <p>"There is much more shadow than light in his character, I fear. If you were to see his manner toward his aged grandmother, Emily, you would feel like boxing his ears. Poor creature! she is very feeble and not likely to remain much longer a burden to him, for such he evidently dently considers her, and makes her feel that he does. With his grandfather he is different, having probably some fear of him."</p> 
               <p>"Do they come often to church-the old couple?" asked Infancy, who had stopped her work, and was listening with lively interest.</p> 
               <p>"No. I have not seen the old man there since the first Sunday after our arrival. His wife comes sometimes-by the-by, Emily, we must go to see her. She is going down to the grave very fast, I think, though Dr. Hunter says she will outlive her husband, who is likely to drop off suddenly at any moment."</p> 
               <p>"Dear-dear Who'd think of it, now? " said Nancy. "To be sure the doctor is like to be right in his thinking,' for he has the power of knowledge, that same doctor, an' a good man he is among the poor."</p> 
               <p>"But he is a Protestant, Nancy," said Mrs. Gillman, slyly.</p> 
               <p>"So he is, ma'am, but he's not a <emph>runagade</emph> Catholic-that makes all the difference in the world," was the quick rejoinder. "But I'm sorry for what he says of old man Blake. I'd like he'd get time to repent; but, indeed, there's a queer look about him lately."</p> 
               <p>"I have noticed it," said Clara. I pity the<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7227-00000051"/> old man, but I fancy he would not thank me for the feeling."</p> 
               <p>"That he wouldn't, Miss; you've just got the right notion of him. He was always cold an' distant in his way, wid as little to do wid anybody as he could, so that he was liked by few. Not but he did a good turn when he was asked to, but 'twas in such a cold way that a body would as soon he'd leave it alone. But he was the truth of an honest man in every sense, an' a true-spoken one; it's a pity Robert doesn't take after him in that respect, as he does in some others. His wife wasn't a bit like him. She was pleasant an' open-minded, wid a smile or a 'save you kindly,' for every one. An' Norry took after her; there was nothin' of the father in her." Nancy paused a moment, and added, musingly, "Though, indeed, now that I think of it, maybe 'twas his own stiff, stubborn way she was showin' when she thought people turned against her for leavin' the church."</p> 
               <p>"Very probably," said Clara. "Old Blake has just the same manner you described in Norry."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, that was just it, an' it never occurred to me before. I never see the old folks now, for since he got past workin' in his bit of ground, an' that's more'n a year ago, he's indoors all the time, an' he never liked visitors even in his best days. I used to drop in to see <emph>her</emph> before that, for I always liked her, an' she was fond of me, I believe, next to her own Norry. Poor soul! she never gave in willingly to the change of religion, I know; but the old man had passed his word to the minister, as well as Norry had to his wife, before they got the help. An' it was always said that Robert Blake's word was as good as another man's oath or bond. Very like 'twas that that made him as well as Norry turn a deaf ear to his Reverence whenever he spoke to them about it, for they wouldn't want to <emph>deny</emph> him in so many words, an' neither would they go back from their promise. But poor mother Blake always cries at the mention of the old Faith, an' well I know her heart is right if she dare to do as she wants, but she was always led by her husband, an' 'tisn't in their old age she'd begin to oppose him."</p> 
               <p>"Now, Nancy, I just want you to tell me one thing," said Mrs. Gillman, with much earnestness. "I see you are trying to make excuses for your friends, whom you still deem guilty of a great crime. I find no fault with either of these feelings-both are natural-but how is it that<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7227-00000052"/> you are so hard on Norry's child? You don't try to excuse <emph>him</emph> at all."</p> 
               <p>"Because I can't, ma'am, to my sorrow. An' bein' Norry's child makes me think the harder of him, maybe, for he's so unlike what a child of her's ought to be, or of Andy's either, for that matter. An' they were both so proud of that boy, ma'am; he was the oldest of their children, an' always showed a turn for learnin'; they had such hopes of what he'd grow up to be-an' now look at him!"</p> 
               <p>"But I fancy that if he went back to your Church, Nancy, you would not think his faults so <emph>very</emph> henious."</p> 
               <p>"You would palliate them in that case, would'nt you?" said Clara, as she saw a covert smile playing around Nancy's mouth.</p> 
               <p>"Why I'd know that he would have to strive to mind them, so that it wouldn't be fair or right to be too hard upon them."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, ho, you're caught at last," said Mrs. Gillman, with a hearty laugh. "I knew all the time that 'tis because of his <emph>religion</emph> you are so much against poor Robert-but why don't you find an excuse for <emph>his</emph> apostacy as well as for that of the others? That's what puzzles me."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I'll tell you ma'am; there was some excuse for them in the temptation they had, an' afterwards in the shame that kept them from acknowledgin' they were in the wrong. But there could be no excuse for the boy either then or ever since, for bein' young-"</p> 
               <p>"That's it," interrupted Mrs. Gillman. "He was young and could not be supposed to have the same attachment to his creed as those who had grown up in it and understood its doctrines. So that if you think them in any way excusable, he must be more so on account of his youth and ignorance."</p> 
               <p>"Not a bit of it, askin' your ladyship's pardon for contradictin' ye. He was old enough to know his religion, an' he <emph>did</emph> know it. Hadn't he his catechism from beginnin' to end, besides readin' ever so many fine religious books; for he was always after the books, an' 'twas serious ones he liked best. (He got that from the grandfather, who never had any fun in him, as they say that knew him from the cradle up.) But over an' above all the rest, he was confirmed the very year before all this happened, an' was under instructions for his first communion when he was led astray."</p> 
               <p>"But he was <emph>led</emph> astray, as you deem it, Nancy; he didn't go voluntarily. That ought to excuse him if he was wrong."</p> 
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7227-00000053"/> 
               <p>"Yes, but not for his obstinacy in holdin' to the wrong afterwards. There's where I blame him, ma'am, dear. Didn't he refuse to hearken to his Reverence, or to Mistress Brown? She was his Catechism teacher, an' took a great interest in the boy, as indeed everybody did at the time. But the minister got a firm hold on him wid his palaver an' his bribes, an' my fine lad had got to think it a disgrace to be a Catholic. Sure he told Mistress Brown so, an' that he was glad his father an' mother were buried in a decent churchyard, an' not amongst the low, ignorant, miserable Papists. You don't like that in him, ma'am. Think of such impudence to a lady like Mistress Brown, an' the talkin' to him for his own good. 'Twas when there was to be confirmation up here, and nothin' would do for Master Robert but he must go wid the rest. There was several of them goin', and faith there was plenty to look at them that they didn't expect,"-and Nancy broke off with a chuckle of suppressed merriment.</p> 
               <p>"When was that?" asked Mrs. Gillman, glancing significantly at her sister, as the remembrance of the "consolatory" visit occurred to both.</p> 
               <p>"I guess it was nigh upon three years ago. They had a great congregation, for a crowd of our folks went, just to make sure that Robert Costello was among them that was confirmed, for he was the talk of the whole place, seein' it was but a short time since he received the right of confirmation-no offence to you, ladies," added the washerwoman, with a civil turn; "you don't make much of confirmation in your church, I believe; but wid us 'tis a holy Sacrament, that requires a great preparation, an' can only be received once in a life-time."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose Robert thought a good thing couldn't be done too often," said Clara. "But, Nancy, I thought Catholics were not allowed to attend the religious services of other denominations."</p> 
               <p>"No more they're not, Miss, 'tis yourself is right; but, you know, curiosity gets the better of us sometimes, an' so it was wid them. 'Twas a fine Sunday besides, an' the confirmation was given just as our people was goin' home from Vespers, an' so a lot of them must go in an' see how it was done; an' how his lordship looked; an' above all, if <emph>that boy</emph> would have the face to present himself for confirmation."</p> 
               <p>"And had he?" asked Clara, in pretended wonder.</p> 
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7227-00000054"/> 
               <p>"He had, Miss; an' ye'd think butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, he looked so pious and holy; so some of our boys said; an' they said, too, that they'd rather than all the fun of the year to have a chance to groan him-the young hypocrite! But the best of all, they said, was to see how his lordship looked an' hear him talk; for he was as pleasant as the flowers of May, seein' such a great congregation about him. Faith, some of them thought they'd die wid tryin' to hold in the laugh, when they saw how took in he was; (<emph>that</emph> had never occurred to them before they went in;) an' how big the minister looked. I warrant he never let on to Lord Woolcut but that was his regular flock."</p> 
               <p>"I don't believe he did," said Clara, exchanging a glance of amusement with her sister, and the washerwoman was surprised to find that they thought the affair 'so divarting.'</p>

               <p>WHAT a pretty girl that is crossing the field," said Mrs. Gillman, one washing day. "Who is she, Nancy?"</p> 
               <p>"She's one of the O'Loughlins," said Nancy, giving a look in the direction indicated, "the oldest daughter of Machael and Kathleen O'Loughlin-Kathleen is her name, though it's Katy most people call her. A pretty girl she is, as you say, an' as good as she is pretty.'</p> 
               <p>"You are great on the goodness, Nancy," said the lady, laughing.</p> 
               <p>"Why not, ma'am? Sure its little use the beauty would be without it."</p> 
               <p>"True enough, Nancy. But who are the O'Loughlins? I don't think I have heard of them, so I suppose the children don't come to our schools."</p> 
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7227-00000055"/> 
               <p>Nancy made a gesture as of scorn at the idea, and replied, "They are a decent family as you could find, both old an' young of them. To be sure it is not wid them now as it was once, for they were well to do, an' had full an' plenty, an' to spare; an' spare they did to all that wanted it; no man, woman or child ever went cold or hungry from their door."</p> 
               <p>"How came they to get poor?-through drink, I'm afraid."</p> 
               <p>"Drink!" echoed Nancy, with indignant emphasis. "That's more than can be thrown up to any one of the O'Loughlins. They wasn't of that sort, ma'am. Sure I remember the grandfather well, the Heavens be his bed. An' 'twas only the other day, I may say, that the father died, a hale, hearty, fine-looking old man that you'd love to look at, wid' all the white hair shinin' like silver about his face that was smooth an' fresh-colored as a young man's. God be good an' merciful to him, as he is, for if the prayers of the poor are a help to the soul-as we know they are-his wasn't in want of them. There was scarcely a dry eye in the parish the day of his funeral, an' such a funeral! Musha, but many a richer man would be proud to have the like."</p> 
                
               <p>"Was it since his death they became poor?" asked Mrs. Gillman, persistently coming back to the first point.</p> 
               <p>"Well, they are not exactly what might be called poor, ma'am, though 'tis poor compared to what they ought to be. They have the same old place-it's one of Lord Woolcut's best farms-but they have to let a good part of the ground of late-"</p> 
               <p>"Which is so much the better for them, if they make the most of what remains. Mr. Gillman says that he thinks Irishmen in general undertake more acres than they can cultivate properly, and so, paying rent for ground which yields not half so much as it should, it is no wonder that they get behind hand."</p> 
               <p>"There's sense in what you're sayin' ma'am, never a doubt. But you see, people that come of an old stock like the O'Loughlins, don't want to have only a shabby bit of land. An' if there's a corner of a field here and there idle, or maybe a whole field, sure it comes good for some poor man or woman that hasn't as much ground to their cabin as would grow a peck of potatoes. Many's the stone of potatoes dug in that way from Michael O'Loughlin's land, not to speak of the fine heads of cabbage an' the lots of turnips an' parsnips."</p> 
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7227-00000056"/> 
               <p>"Of course, these people pay something for the use of the ground."</p> 
               <p>"Is it to the O'Loughlins?" cried Nancy, with a look of horror, that made Mrs. Gillman almost fancy for a moment that she had advanced some shocking proposition. "Why, then, 'twould ill become them to be hard on the poor an' distressed. To be sure there's farmers that gets a trifle for the use of their ground, as you say, mostly paid in labor, but not the likes of the O'Loughlins; they would never demean the name that's on them by such screwin.'"</p> 
               <p>"If they have acted in other respects as foolishly, I no longer wonder that they get reduced," said the curate's wife, with some vexation in her look and tone. "I like people to be charitable; indeed, I consider it a solemn duty-"</p> 
               <p>"Sure, you've showed that since you come amongst us," put in Nancy.</p> 
               <p>"But I believe in being charitable according to one's means; not in giving without stint or measure."</p> 
               <p>"That's the way the O'Loughlins give, then. They knew that what they gave to the poor they were lendin' to the Lord, an' 'tisn't keepin' account of what they lend to Him they'd be. They'll never be the losers in the long run."</p> 
                
               <p>"Well, if they are satisfied I'm sure I ought to be. But, Nancy, all this time you have not told me how it happened that they got down in the world. I am very much afraid there is something wrong about them, or you would not be so backward in telling their history."</p> 
               <p>"That there isn't, then," said Nancy stoutly. "No one livin' or dead could accuse Michael O'Loughlin of wrong doin', that is, if they told the truth; of course, they could belie him as well as another, but that would be to themselves. An' as for the way he got poorer, 'twould be hard for me to tell just how it was, for there was more than one thing the cause of it. First of all there was the burthen of another family put on him along wid his own, after his older brother, Daniel, was turned out of his own place. A fine place it was, too, as I've heard tell, for I never saw it myself, for 'twas a good distance from here. Daniel voted against his landlord's candidate, an' so lost his land; an' he made up his mind he wouldn't stay in Ireland, but would go out to Meriky, where he could get a little farm of his own that no one could turn him out of, nor his children after him. Oh, what a place it must be, ma'am, that same Meriky-Heaven's blessin' rest on it ever an' always!-'tis a grand country entirely!</p> 
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7227-00000057"/> 
               <p>"So Daniel sold his cattle an' all he had except feather beds an' the like, that they would take wid them in the ship, an' they come to see the father, (for the mother was dead an' gone long before, the Lord be good to her!) before they'd set sail. The father was loth to have them go, an' so was the grandfather, an' as for Michael, he set his face against it from the start. But when he found it was all no use, 'anyhow,' says he, 'if you will go, at least leave your family wid us; for it's like enough that you'll be for comin' back, an' it will be easier for youself to come than if you have a wife an' six children along.' 'There's reason in what he says, an' be said by him,' the father pleaded; so the long an' short of it was that he left five of the children wid them, but the wife wouldn't stay behind for any coaxin'. An' they went-takin' their oldest boy along-an' ma'am dear, that was the last ever seen of them in this world, for the ship was lost at sea an' wid it every one on board. Heaven be good an' merciful to them, poor souls! 'twas in search of a good home they were goin', the most of them, an' sure enough they found the best of all. Oh, but it was a sad day wid the O'Loughlins when the news come, an' wid others besides, for many a one had friends or relations on board, but I needn't talk of the grief, for you know well what it was without the tellin'. Anyway, the O'Loughlins took comfort in havin' the children safe, though, of course, they had to do for them now, for all their parents' means was lost wid themselves. But the little creatures never felt the want of it, neither did they know what it was to be orphans, except it might be they'd miss the <emph>mother-love</emph> that no other love on earth can ever make up for-for sure the mother's love is most like that of God himself-praise, honor and glory be to His holy name. So as I was sayin', Michael was like a father to his brother's children from that day out, an' his jewel of a wife-she was one of the Morrissy's, of Clooneen, an' fine people they are-she was mother as well as aunt to them, as far forth as a good heart would let her. She had three little ones of her own then, an' the eight grew up together like brothers an' sisters; an' when other children was born, it still made no difference wid the orphans. Small danger was there of them being crowded out of the love of the uncle and aunt, for the more children come to them, the bigger grew their hearts to hold them all."</p> 
               <p>"That's a very good account of the O'Loughlins, Nancy," said the curate's wife, in a hearty<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7227-00000058"/> tone. "I can look over all their improvidence now. In truth, with the closest economy, I don't see that they could help going a little behindhand when they had so large a family to provide for in addition to their own."</p> 
               <p>"An' their own was ten-every one of ten children."</p> 
               <p>"Ten!" echoed Mrs. Gillman. "Mercy on me-what a family! Fifteen children!"</p> 
               <p>"Sorra a one less!" said Nancy, complacently. "Ten children they had an' have yet wid them, barrin' one that's away at college, an' he'll soon be priested now, please God. So you see 'twas a long family entirely, an' nothin' was saved nor spared upon them, so as your ladyship says' twas little wonder that things began not to go so well wid them. Then there was the bad seasons; of course, they lost by them as well as others did; an' next the famine, when they stinted themselves to give to the naked an' the hungry, for it never was in one of their kind to see distress without wantin' to relieve it. An' after that was all past an' gone, the rent of their place was riz, (an' it was high enough before,) because, you see, they were among the foremost in standin' out against the soupers, an' keeping the weak an' the lukewarm from fallin' into the trap laid for them. An' why wouldn't they? Who would the priest of God-blessings on him!-have to depend upon for backin' him in every struggle for religion, if not them that's left of the old stock whose forefathers parted wid all they had on earth sooner than give up that same faith-the Lord increase it all over the world, as He is! An' that's the way it happened wid the O'Loughlins, ma'am, an' wid many besides."</p> 
               <p>"And the orphans?-but of course they are grown up now. I hope they did well."</p> 
               <p>"That they did. The oldest girl, Mary, a pretty colleen she was, got married to a great Councellor all the way from County Waterford. He come here wid a lot of fine ladies an' gentlemen one summer, to see the beauty of the country 'round about this; and faith, Mister Collins saw nothin' so pleasin' to him as Mary O'Loughlin, an' nothin' would do but he must carry her home wid him, when he went in the autumn. He was a fine-looking gentleman, an' a generous one, too, for when the uncle began to speak of the fortune he'd give wid her, Mister Collins declared he'd never take a pound of it, no, nor a penny; let it go to her two twin sisters, or to the boys, but have it he wouldn't. But when the uncle grew vexed-like, an' told him no girl of his<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7227-00000059"/> should go widout fortune to any man's floor, he gave in an' took the money, an' what did he do but hand it over to Mary to keep for her brother Mark. They took him wid them to give good schoolin' to, an' now he's a fine young fellow, studyin' law wid the Counsellor. So you see Mary did well for herself, ma'am."</p> 
               <p>"She did, indeed," said Mrs. Gillman, with a look of pleasure, "and for her brother, too. I hope the twins did as well."</p> 
               <p>"Faith an' they did better," said Nancy, with a chuckle, "for they gave themselves to God, an' it's two holy nuns they are now, shut out from this wicked world."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman's smile of pleasure vanished; her prejudices against nunneries, though vague, was none the less strong.</p> 
               <p>"But what became of the other one?" she asked, after a pause.</p> 
               <p>"The other, he was the oldest of the five, an' a fine, straight, handsome lad he grew to be, but that was no wonder, for all his kin are that same. There wasn't a smarter nor a finer young fellow in the parish, first an' foremost in every lark that was goin' on, an' yet as grave as the priest himself in the church. Och, it did a body good to see him serve at Mass-he was so sedate and respectful, an' had such a graceful way wid him. He was a good scholar, too, for the priest, seein' the thirst he had for Latin and such fine studies, instructed him himself, though indeed 'tis little time to spare the priests have-the Lord reward them!-in places like this, where their flock is scattered about for miles among the mountains."</p> 
               <p>"Well?" said Mrs. Gillman inquiringly, as Nancy made a long pause and went on with her work as if nothing more remained to be told, "I hope you are not going to tell me that he is dead."</p> 
               <p>"What would I be tellin' you such a lie for, savin' your presence, ma'am, an' he livin', though he's far away from them that loves him, but please God! one of these days they'll have him back again. Well, you see, he was a fine youth, this William O'Loughlin-he was called after his grandfather-when Smith O'Brien, long life to him!" (the ejaculation having double emphasis as Mrs. Gillman frowned on hearing the name,) "sure 'twas a pity that things turned out as they did; but when he an' the rest of the patriots were strivin' to strike a blow for the dear old land, William joined the 'Young Irelanders,' an' it was proved against him; (not that he denied it, for he gloried in sufferin' for his country if he couldn't<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7227-00000060"/> fight for her;) so the end of it was they transported him-the fine, noble young man that he was. Oh, but it was a cruel thing to do."</p> 
               <p>"It was too good for him-the young traitor should have been hung," said the curate's wife in a tone Nancy had never heard from her before. "It was false mercy in the British government to spare O'Brien and his band of traitors-they all richly deserved the halter."</p> 
               <p>"Faith, then, 'twas little mercy they'd have got but for the dread the same government was in, I'm thinkin'. It knew better than to hang the brave gentlemen, when all the world, as one may say, was on their side."</p> 
               <p>And having thus "defined her position," the true-hearted woman betook herself to hanging out her clothes before "the enemy" could respond. From that day Mrs. Gillman lost ground in Nancy's good opinion.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">The Apostate's Death-bed.</head> 
               <p>HURRY on, Joe; sure we'll never get to the end of our road at this rate."</p> 
               <p>"Easy talking! How can I hurry faster, with the wind in my teeth and the snow all's one as blinding me? Bedad, I never seen such a place. In the pretty little town I came from we never have-may I never if he isn't shooting ahead of me! Listen to him, now!-yes, I hear you, Larry Conner; sure I'm making after you as fast as I can."</p> 
               <p>That was not very fast, however, for what with the driving wind, the blinding sleet, and the difficulty of following the rugged mountain path in the increasing darkness, the "townsman," whose heart was none of the stoutest, nor his physical strength remarkable, felt his "courage" and his blood cooling rapidly. Ever and<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7227-00000061"/> anon he was forced to stop and take breath, while the other, with undaunted step, strode onward like "one to the" mountain "born."</p> 
               <p>"Heaven help us and all poor travelers," said the stranger, as having joined Larry he trudged on wofully, "'tis a black and a bitter night."</p> 
               <p>"Black do ye call it, when the beautiful snow is waving a white winding-sheet over everything?"</p> 
               <p>"The Lord be between us and harm!" piously ejaculated Joe. "Don't be talking of winding-sheets when maybe 'tis in need of one we'll be before the morning's dawn, Larry Connor."</p> 
               <p>"It's froze stiff I'll be if we don't get to some shelter soon," said Joe, piteously, as after another pause to 'draw his breath' he was relentlessly hurried forward by his stout-hearted, sure-footed companion. Is it much further to yer house, Larry."</p> 
               <p>"Not much over a mile-a mile and a quarter at most." Joe groaned in despair. "But my father's is nearer, if ye'd like to"-</p> 
               <p>"Arrah, tell me when we come to the first place of shelter-the very first, won't you, Larry? I'll stop there for the night, if its only a pig-pen. Ugh, its worse the snow's getting! There'll be neither hedge nor ditch to be seen by to-morrow morning if it keeps on this way."</p> 
                
               <p>"No, nor the roof of a cabin by to-morrow night," was the unsympathizing rejoinder. "But if we're froze stiff before the morning's dawn its little we'll care how deep the snow is."</p> 
               <p>"Whist, now! Don't be going on wid you're jokes an' your light talk; it's no triflin' danger we're in, take my word for it. The Lord bring us safe through."</p> 
               <p>"Amen!" said his tantalizing companion. "But, I say, Joe Harrigan, if you're never in greater danger than now, you'll do well. There's old Blake's cabin just ahead of us."</p> 
               <p>"The saints be praised!" was the sincere ejaculation.</p> 
               <p>"Well, are you for stopping there, or going on to my father's-which?"</p> 
               <p>"Not till morning, Larry; sure every foot of ground is a mile to-night."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, I'll come up for you brave and early."</p> 
               <p>"But wouldn't you stay here for the night yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Me!</emph>" I'd sleep in the snow-drift, aye, and perish there, before I'd sleep under his roof-the apostate!" interrupted Connor with a fierceness that startled the timid little Joe.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, well, never mind, sure I didn't mean any<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7227-00000062"/> harm," he said, soothingly; "but it's not leaving me at the door you'd be? Sure, I'm a stranger in the place, Larry, and then if it wouldn't be convenient-"</p> 
               <p>"Well, well; knock at the door," said Connor, impatiently.</p> 
               <p>The other did so, but in his haste opened the door for himself and put in his head with a "God save all here! Could you let a body stop over night? It's only a stretch on the floor I'd ask for-anything for shelter-it's a wild night abroad-glory be to God!"</p> 
               <p>Finding this eloquent appeal unanswered, he pushed the door farther open, and cautiously thrust his head forward to reconnoitre, till Larry pushed him in and followed, holding the door to against the driving storm, while he looked around for some one to whom he could introduce his companion; a matter that vexed him not a little, but what true Irishman would refuse to oblige a stranger?</p> 
               <p>The room was untenanted and dark; but in the apartment beyond, a rush light threw a lurid glare over an aged woman who stood leaning against a table, shaking her finger warningly at some person whom they could not see, and to whom she was speaking vehemently in a tone of alternate anger and entreaty.</p> 
                
               <p>"Don't bring the curse of God on you, Robert a-cushla; you have too much of it already, poor boy, but that's not so much your own fault as of others. Don't refuse your grandfather this. Are you goin' when I bid you, hardened creature that you are, are you goin' this minute, I ask you? Ah, do then, machree; don't you ever refuse the prayer of the dyin' an' the helpless. Sure 'twas God put it into his heart to ask-'twas the Lord himself an' none other, though it's little but scourges we deserve at His hands. Go, machree, I beg it of you, for the sake of your mother, that would go on her knees every step of the way if she was livin' this night, sooner than deny her dyin' father's prayers-go, for <emph>her</emph> sake, if for no other, darlint!"</p> 
               <p>A low muttered reply, which the listeners could not catch, followed.</p> 
               <p>"You won't-is that what you say?" the aged form shook with weakness and excitement, "I'll go, then. He shall never die widout the comfort he's wantin'. <emph>I'll</emph> go, an' if I perish on the mountain this wild night it'll be more added to your account. But what care you for that?" she added, bitterly, as finding even this unavailing, she turned and dashed forward to leave the cabin.</p> 
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7227-00000063"/> 
               <p>Conner shut the door and advanced to meet her. At sight of him she raised her arms, and with a cry of thankfulness that rang through the place, she cried out: "Now, praise be to Him that hasn't deserted us. 'Twas He sent you-look there!"</p> 
               <p>Conner followed her to the inner room. There lay the aged man, "the apostate," against whom he had but a few minutes before expressed himself so bitterly, motionless, with no sign of life save a labored gasp for breath; it needed but a glance to tell that life was slowly ebbing away. With a quick revulsion of feeling Conner laid his hand gently on the old wife's arm.</p> 
               <p>"Was it the priest ye were wanting?" he asked hurriedly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, the priest," she repeated, piteously, as she raised her eyes to his, "the last word he said was to send for the priest."</p> 
               <p>"Never fear," interrupted Conner, "his Reverence will be here directly;" and ere the last words had left his lips he was gone.</p> 
               <p>Joe Harrigan, who had meanwhile been warming himself at the fire, looked after him wonderingly as he dashed rapidly away through the darkness and storm; then slowly found his way into the other apartment, and gazed curiously on the dying man. "God be good to him and to us all," he said, after a long gaze, "he's making his way fast."</p> 
               <p>The woman did not heed him. Her energy had spent itself, and now on her knees by the bedside, her skinny hands clasped together, and her feeble form rocking to and fro, she wept quietly, and murmured prayers for him who lay motionless before her.</p> 
               <p>Harrigan next turned in search of the person to whom she had been speaking on his entrance, and beheld at the farther end of the table a youth whose face was partially revealed as it rested on one hand, while in the other he held a book which he was reading attentively. Harrigan looked at him with wonder and indignation. There was something so revolting in the composure with which the boy pored over his book, while within a few feet lay the aged pilgrim whose spirit hovered on the borders of the unknown world, watched over by one as old, and who ere long would follow the companion of half a century through the Valley of Death. Oh, it was sad to look upon her thus, to realize the anxiety that pressed upon her worn spirit, as the one desire spoke in every prayer, that "the priest might come in time!"</p> 
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7227-00000064"/> 
               <p>The moments dragged slowly by, and with each her anxiety grew more intense. Again and again she started and listened eagerly, but no sound was heard, save the wild howling and whistling of the wind.</p> 
               <p>"His Reverence'll be too late, I'm afraid," said Harrigan, at length.</p> 
               <p>"Too late!" She wailed forth the words in a tone of anguish that struck to his heart. Then throwing her arms around the motionless form she wildly addressed him in Irish, mingling promises of the priest's coming with passionate entreaties to look upon her-to speak to her, if only one word.</p> 
               <p>"Don't; don't, now, if you want him to live," and Harrigan drew her with gentle force away. "The sooner he's disturbed the shorter time he'll have; all his chance of holding out depends on being left quiet. You may believe what I'm telling you, ma'am, for I saw folks in this way before now." The poor creature suffered him to lead her to a seat at the foot of the bed, where she could still gaze through her tears on the face of the dying.</p> 
               <p>"How long is he in this way?" asked the stranger, unwilling to have another interval of the dreary silence.</p> 
                
               <p>Something of her previous energy was aroused by the question, and with a vehemence that rendered her words at times unintelligible, she related that her husband had been struck with death "all of a sudden," just before his grand-son's return from school-that he spoke only once, and then to beg her to send for the priest-that she had besought Robert to do his grandfather's bidding, but he refused, saying that if Mr. Gillman was at home he would go for <emph>him,</emph> but unluckily he was away in the country-that she continued to beg him to go, and at last he went out to bring the priest, as she thought-that after a long time he returned, and in answer to her questions said he he "did not go for the priest, he would not have any Popish mummery over his grandfather, who was a Protestant, and should die and be buried as one"-that he had then sat down to his books and paid no more attention to her entreaties to go for Father Dillon-and at last God had sent one to her who needed no coaxing and pleading to perform a Christian duty.</p> 
               <p>To all this the indignant stranger listened with eager interest, and was not backward in making such comments on it as his feelings prompted. But she soon ceased to heed him;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7227-00000065"/> her head sank upon the bed, and she prayed and listened as before.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly the door was thrown open, and with a cry of joy the woman started to her feet as Larry Conner ushered in the reverend Father who came quickly forward, throwing off his wet overcoat, as he said in a kind, fatherly tone, "Pax huic domui"-(Peace be to this house.)</p> 
               <p>"Here's his Reverence now, <emph>asthore,</emph>" shouted the old wife eagerly in Irish to the dying man. "Robert, <foreign xml:lang="GAI">a-suilish mahuil agus machree!</foreign> (light of my eyes and of my heart!) rouse up for the love of God-here's Father Dillon-here's the <foreign xml:lang="GAI">soggarth aroon.</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>But even the voice of affection failed to reach the torpid senses. With a heartbreaking wail she drew back. "Wirra! wirra! he doesn't hear me-he's gone without the last rites!"</p> 
               <p>"Am I then too late?" cried the priest, in a tone of anguish. "O God of life and death! grant him yet a little time for the sake of Thy blessed Son, Jesus!"</p> 
               <p>As he uttered the adorable name he sprinkled holy water over the dying man, and signed him with that "tremendous sign" at which hell trembles, earth hopes, and heaven rejoices; then spoke in a cheering voice, "My poor child, don't you know your priest? I have come to bring you pardon and peace from our good God."</p> 
               <p>The rigid lips parted, the glazed eyes turned in the direction of the voice, the paralized tongue made an effort to speak, alas! a vain effort. But it was evident that he recognized and understood the saintly messenger of Heaven, for in answer to his various questions the latter felt the cold hand he had taken feebly press his own, while again and again a convulsive effort was made to answer him, but the power of speech was gone forever. The absolution was given, the last anointing followed, and during the succeeding prayers the penitent soul passed away.</p> 
               <p>The poor old wife knew not when the death-angel gave the final stroke. Satisfied with hearing the words of absolution pronounced, she wept in silence beside the two men who were pouring forth their ardent supplications for the departing spirit. Father Dillon then repeated the prayers for the departed, to which they fervently responded.</p> 
               <p>"Poor soul! she's fell asleep," said Larry Conner, who had been supporting the feeble form by his side.</p> 
               <p>The priest leaned over with a sudden fear. "Thank God! it is not death," he exclaimed,<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7227-00000066"/> with a sigh of relief. "Don't wake her, boys-let her sleep as long as she can"-as with tender care he helped to place her on the other bed.</p> 
               <p>"That rest is badly wanting to her," said Harrigan; and he repeated all she had told him of her grandson's stubborn disobedience.</p> 
               <p>"An' as I live there he sits yet," said Conner, with a fiery glance at the youth, who throughout the affecting and solemn scene just passed had never quitted his studious position at the table.</p> 
               <p>The priest stepped forward; a glance at the open volume revealed its <emph>sacred</emph> character. "Is it from the bible-King James' bible-that you have learned to be so unfeeling-so brutal?" he asked, gravely and sadly.</p> 
               <p>The boy looked up. His face was flushed with angry feelings, to which he was about to give utterance, but the mournful, tender expression of the eyes which were steadfastly observing him, checked his insolence. Slowly he arose, as if constrained to show respect in spite of himself: his bold, defiant eyes wandered, and finally drooped beneath their long black lashes. That was all.</p> 
               <p>"No thought of good," as Larry Conner whispered to Harrigan, "could the priest put into that unnatural whelp."</p> 
                
               <p>"I believe you," was the reply. "His Reverence might as well give over talking to him."</p> 
               <p>And so the priest found it, and after a mild and earnest exhortation to the misguided youth, he turned away with a sigh, and a prayer that that heart might yet be touched with heavenly grace. It was a sore grief to him in this hour which had otherwise been full of consolation, as witnessing the return to God of one of the wanderers whose apostacy had caused him the keenest sorrow. Full of the spirit of Him who prayed that He might "not lose any of those whom the Father had given Him," the "<foreign xml:lang="GAI">Soggarth aroon</foreign>" prays and toils unweariedly to bring his flock safely through the temptations of earth to a heavenly home; and only the guardian angels know how he sorrows over those who remain estranged from God. Many an hour of anguish had the famine-converts caused the faithful Pastor of Bartrymore; but proportionably great was his joy when the wanderers returned to be again received by him into the fold from which only the keenest suffering and want had caused them to stray. Now another had returned at the eleventh hour; and, although a death-bed repentance is seldom to be trusted, the zealous priest felt a consoling assurance that in this case<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7227-00000067"/> it was sincere, and acceptable to the Merciful One who loves to "crown His own gifts" in His frail creatures. And as his thoughts reverted to her who now slumbered in happy unconsciousness of her bereavement, he rejoiced that she, also, was disposed to "arise and go to her Father," an humble and sincere penitent But the misguided youth, around whom had been woven every net that <emph>religious</emph> zeal could devise-in whom ambition, and pride, and vanity had all been enlisted as powerful auxiliaries to keep him steadfast in "the reformed faith"-alas! what hope was there that he would escape the toils?"</p> 
               <p>The news of old Robert Blake's conversion in his last hour soon spread through Bartrymore, and gained him what was universally pronounced "a decent wake an' a still decenter funeral." It was touching to hear the various excuses offered for the "obstinacy" of one who in his best time had never been very popular with his neighbors; had the question of his pardon or condemnation for eternity depended on their decision, they could not have been more ingenious in seeking "reasons" for acting the way he did.</p> 
               <p>One thought that "it was little wonder he held back from comin' forward an' confessin' his crime in leavin' the Church-sure we all have our little pride-the Saints help us to overcome it!-an' the more guilty we know ourselves to be, the more loth we are to acknowledge it." Another thought it had been "the old man's intention to let things stand till Robert's education was finished." Many persons thought he had been deterred "from doing what was right by gratitude to Lord Woolcut, who, to do him justice, was very good to the old couple, leaving them the cabin rent free, and keeping the boy in the best of clothes, besides giving him some money now and then to help them through." But the majority insisted that "it was his love for his daughter, Norry Costello, that kept him back from doing what he maybe thought would be like casting censure on her in her grave."</p> 
               <p>And this having brought up the name of Norry, many a little anecdote of her was recollected and dwelt upon with regretful fondness by those who, like Nancy Boyle, found it hard to have to omit the accustomed "Heaven rest her soul!" And Robert, his late act of undutifulness was duly talked over and wondered at, even by those who had long since declared "they would be surprised at nothing bad he'd do," but who now admitted they would never have thought him so hardened and unnatural, "and he so young, and all that the old couple had left to them." Curious eyes wandered about in quest of him, but he was nowhere<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7227-00000068"/> to be seen. And it was a stranger, (though none seemed strangers there,) who had to support the aged mourner, as she tottered after the lifeless form to the church and to the grave, happy amid all her grief that it was to repose <emph>there.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>The occasion was one of unusual solemnity from the peculiar circumstances attending the death. With deep emotion Father Dillon read the solemn burial service, and in an impressive manner addressed the assemblage, imploring their prayers for the soul to whom "the night had come in which no man can work." When he spoke of the trials the deceased bad known, every lip quivered and every eye filled, for to most there the picture equally represented their own lot in life, so fraught with temptations-so fruitful of sorrow and suffering-so barren of comforts. And good resolves sprang up in every heart as their revered Pastor eloquently exhorted <emph>them</emph> to persevere in inviolable fidelity to the Faith which a God came from heaven to bestow on man: that Faith which watches unceasingly over her children, from the cradle to the grave; aye, beyond the grave-offering up, like a tender mother, her tears, her prayers, her sacrifices, to hasten their admission to that glory which "it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub"> Bigotry in the Ascendant.</head> 
               <p>ROBERT Costello, as has been said, kept aloof from both wake and funeral. That clever youth-devout reader of "the word"-had left his home immediately after his grandfather's death, and taken up his abode at the sexton's, where he was not likely to be molested by popish intruders. This was a step he had long meditated, especially since his late appointment as assistant teacher, but a secret dread of his grandfather had restrained him from making known his intention. Now he was free to follow his inclination, and it led him straight to "old Egan's," without even troubling himself to bid his bereaved grandmother farewell. His procedure increased the excitement prevailing in the parish. Pity for the deceased, sympathy for the aged mourner, gave way to intense indignation against<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7227-00000069"/> the "unnatural grandson." In this feeling Mr. Gillman and his family fully shared, and the ladies freely expressed their sentiments, particularly in conversation with the younger Egan, who, like his father, warmly extolled the brave conduct of his assistant, and declared that he deemed their home honored in sheltering such a guest.</p> 
               <p>"Robert could not have done otherwise-indeed, you must not blame him," said he, in discussing the subject with Mrs. Gillman.</p> 
               <p>"Not blame him!" repeated the minister's wife, warmly. "I don't know what reason I have given you to think me so lost to all feeling as not to blame such unfilial conduct."</p> 
               <p>"That remark hits me," said the teacher, with a smile, that but poorly masked his chagrin.</p> 
               <p>"Different people see things in a different light. I for one cannot affect indifference on such a subject. Robert Costello's conduct would be regarded with horror by the very heathens. Strange that Christians must strive to justify it."</p> 
               <p>"But consider how he was situated, my dear madam," urged the teacher, "and perhaps you will deem him less reprehensible."</p> 
               <p>"Go on. I am rather curious to hear your arguments."</p> 
               <p>"Under different circumstances he might have acted differently; but, indeed, as things were, I do not see how he could have done otherwise. His presence would not have been much comfort to the poor old woman-"</p> 
               <p>"In <emph>that</emph> I fully agree with you," interposed Mrs. Gillman, drily.</p> 
               <p>"The priest had taken the opportunity to lecture him harshly, and endeavor to pervert him to Romanism, Then Larry Conner and all to whom he gave his one-sided version of the matter were ready to tear the poor fellow to pieces as 'a brute of a Protestant villain;' there was no chance of rest or peace for him, save in removing from the cabin, and that he did as quietly and inoffensively as possible. For my part I think he was, if anything, too forbearing. Had <emph>I</emph> been in his place I should have let them know that I was then master of the house, and had a right to exclude from it whom I pleased, and that would have been every bigoted papist, from the priest down."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gillman could not see that the schoolmaster's explanation placed the matter in a better light. "The boy's demeanor from the very beginning was most unbecoming. Think of him calmly sitting down to study while his grandfather was in the agonies of death!"</p> 
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7227-00000070"/> 
               <p>"He could not conscientiously have taken part in the mummery which the priest was enacting, with the help of Conner and his friend."</p> 
               <p>"But for whose providential arrival the poor woman would have had no one to comfort her in that trying hour. I do not say that Robert should have taken part in the religious ceremonies, but I insist that his place was by that death bed, supporting and consoling his broken-hearted grandmother, as any dutiful child would have done."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps you would have him turn papist, by way of consoling her," sneered the schoolmaster.</p> 
               <p>"He has done worse," was the impulsive reply. "Papists are at least <emph>Christians</emph>-that is a name I should never think of applying to Robert Costello."</p> 
               <p>Mr Egan shrugged his shoulders, and refrained from further discussion of the subject-she was probably half papist herself.</p> 
               <p>The curate sometimes expostulated with his wife on the imprudence of expressing herself so vehemently to the sexton and his son; though he acknowledged that he had himself incurred the displeasure of higher powers, by venturing to disapprove of young Costello.</p> 
               <p>"Had I any real authority over school affairs he should not be teacher another day. I intimated as much to the bishop, but he takes an exactly opposite view, and is more partial to the lad than ever."</p> 
               <p>"Well, poor as was my opinion of Lord Woolcut, I could never imagine that he could carry bigotry so far as that."</p> 
               <p>The curate smiled sadly. "There are things daily occurring which you would deem impossible, my clear. From certain indications I have no doubt that we will soon find Master Robert's conduct applauded in the highest religious circles, as a pattern to the youth of the United Kingdom. You are incredulous, Emily? Wait and you will see that I am right."</p> 
               <p>And Mr. Gillman was right in his prediction, as the event proved. Robert Costello's steadfastness in the faith, the martyr-like firmness with which he repulsed the priest's overtures, and, stifling his natural feelings, (?) went forth alone and desolate from the home of his infancy-even giving up for conscience sake the society of his still beloved, though misguided relative, whose mind, weakened by age and sorrow, had succumbed helplessly to the dread power of the priest-all this was written and told by evangelical agents and scripture readers, and read<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7227-00000071"/> and listened to by crowds of admiring Protestants. Such wonderful heroism! such fidelity! and in one so young, and surrounded, too, by the barbarous, unscrupulous devotees of Popery-where could a similar instance be found?</p> 
               <p>"Nowhere, it is to be hoped for the credit of human nature," was Mrs. Gillman's reply to the question, as put by a friend in England, who had written in a strain of enthusiastic pathos, congratulating her again and again that her husband's parish had the distinguished honor of producing this wonderful phenomenon-this noble young champion of Protestantism.</p> 
               <p>Many were the testimonials the young champion received; mostly letters of praise and exhortation, ending with a request for his autograph. Some however were accompanied with substantial tokens of esteem, in the shape of worked slippers and purses from admiring ladies, and small sums of money from appreciative gentlemen. The curate's wife heard of these various movements with indignation that could only find vent in the charitable hope, that the descendants of the pious donors would follow the wortny example of the champion, and leave them in the hour of death, or bereavement, to the pitying care of strangers.</p> 
                
               <p>But if the curate gave offence to the zealous inhabitants of the "Episcopal Palace," by his disapproval of the promising young disciple, he was not long after guilty of an unpardonable crime in refusing to interfere with the Romish priest during the last illness of Robert's grandmother. He, indeed, visited her frequently, but he went, as he told Father Dillon, not to impart, but to receive instruction; and he was deeply impressed by the lessons he received at that humble death-couch, from the pious example of the aged penitent, and the consoling influence of the faith which was rendering blessed the last days of her life. How could he presume to disturb the serenity of the dying by theological disquisitions on the errors of that religion to which it was evident her heart had always clung? With an innate delicacy of feeling quite out of place in one whose business it was to be a zealous proselytiser, he shrank from enacting the part of a religious teacher, in that presence, though well aware that he would thereby incur the severest censure of his bishop.</p> 
               <p>And very pleasant it was to him to find how quickly the dying woman understood and appreciated his feelings; to see the dim eyes that had at first marked his entrance with a look of<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7227-00000072"/> anxious timidity, now welcome him with a glance of trusting confidence; to find himself associated with her own beloved pastor in her earnest appeal on behalf of her poor, erring grandson. It was a strange charge to give to a Protestant curate; but Mr. Gillman accepted it without hesitation, promising solemnly that he would never (in her own language) "lay a straw in the poor boy's way," if he showed a disposition to return to the Catholic Church, and this promise from one whom she naturally thought would exercise some influence on the boy's future, went far towards tranquilizing her last earthly care.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Gillman, however was not to be much longer the curate of Bartrymore. This last proof of his lukewarmness in the cause was not to be passed over like his previous shortcomings. The lord bishop and his daughter, who had never liked either the curate or his family, were now resolved that things should undergo a total revolution; and luckily about this time the Hon. and Rev. Rector of the parish found a person who was every way fitted for the important charge.</p> 
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Robinson was recommended as a model of clerical zeal; he was one, it was averred, who could make converts where all others failed, and who was willing to spend himself self in the service of the gospel. Moreover, his daughter, who had kept house for him, from the period of her mother's death, was married to a gentleman who, having lately failed in business, was supposed to be thereby qualified for school teaching, since that was the only avocation now open to him. Mr. Turner, therefore, would be happy to take the place of the younger Egan, who had lately found a more lucrative situation; and his wife, having no family to interfere with the important duties, could take charge of the female school.</p> 
               <p>The family at the parsonage, accordingly, got brief notice to leave. A brighter prospect was before them, yet it was not without regret that they left the "far west," their short residence in which had dispelled so many preconceived opinions. And, surely, never before was so much grief shown by a Catholic population in parting with a Protestant minister; never did the ladies of a parsonage receive more unequivocal proofs of the respect and affection they had deservedly won. "The millenium" was over in Bartrymore; a new order of affairs was to be inaugurated.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">The New Minister.</head> 
               <p>THE new minister speedily arrived, a very different personage in all respects from his predecessor, as he soon made manifiest. If the lord bishop's testimony might be credited, Mr. Robinson was a most exemplary minister of the word, a pious, saintly clergyman; while those among whom he had come to labor mostly pronounced him a meddlesome, impudent sort of man. Probably both opinions were correct according to the opposite views of the parties. Mr. Robinson possessed one great advantage, he could adapt himself readily to the peculiar circumstances of each case, could be hauty or familiar, solemn or merry, according as he deemed proper; as he was wont to say, he followed the maxim of Paul, in making himself "all things to all men, that he might gain all to Christ." No wonder that such a man was soon regarded by his lordship as a treasure, and the most sanguine expectations entertained of the success of his mission.</p> 
               <p>Without loss of time he made himself acquainted with the views of his noble patrons, and set ardently to work. No rebuff disconcerted, no fatigue wearied, no obstacle discouraged him. Day after day he traversed the highways and byways of Bartrymore, seeking out the tenants of the Lord Bishop, with the bible in one pocket, and a receipt for any trifling arrears of rent due in the other; he was ready to interest himself for such of the men as wanted work; he would see that the miserable cabins were repaired, for the comfort of the women. He would see that the children got good clothes, there was no end to the promises and bribes he was willing to offer, <emph>provided</emph> the children were allowed to come to school; and when all these failed of success, he threw out very plain threats of coercion, always the favorite remedy with tyrants great and small.</p> 
               <p>So, with much toil and difficulty, he managed to gain over a few, who thought there could be no harm in sending the creatures to school for a little while, just to see how things would turn out; and the schools were soon on the tide of<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7227-00000074"/> successful experiment. Mr. and Mrs. Turner were his faithful co-laborers, instructing the children from the bible without note or comment; taking occasion, now and then; to inculcate the vast superiority of the Saxon race over all others; and dilating on the wonderful glory and prosperity of Protestant England as the greatest nation on the face of the globe. Such teaching was likely, from its novelty, to make some impression on the pupils, especially when they had before them a specimen of "Protestant prosperity" in the person of Robert Costello. The older lads could remember him as formerly one of themselves, but now he was elevated immeasurably above them, and looked "the gentleman entirely" in his fine suit of clothes; was the right hand man of the new parson, and was always noticed most graciously by the noble patrons of the establishment. It was plain to all that he had done well for himself and what if his apostacy was censured in other quarters, when he was cited by teachers and visitors as an example of what each boy there might hope to become.</p> 
               <p>The two principals contrived to make themselves immensely popular with their pupils, and Mr. Robinson often looked in to see how they were getting on, and his flatteries and funny anecdotes always insured him a hearty welcome. He had an unfailing fund of stories about good boys and girls who always chanced to be Protestants, and about bad boys and girls who, of course, were always Catholics. Soon he began to excite their childish sympathies by wonderful tales of persecutions, in which naughty Papists always figured as the persecutors, and saintly Protestants as the glorious martyrs; and having thus glided almost imperceptibly into the subject of religion, he could venture sometimes on a fling at this Popish doctrine and a laugh at that Romish superstition, with little fear that the children would report him "out of school." And indeed the older scholars being encouraged to come early to the school-house, and remain after hours, as it was such a nice place for play, or study, were gradually withdrawn almost wholly from parental guardianship. And then, how easy to puff up those innocent minds with the idea that they were superior to the children who were attending "Mrs. Brown's ragged school," or at home learning nothing.</p> 
               <p>Affairs were now in a highly satisfactory state to the ruling powers. What though the attendance at the church continued slim, Lord<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7227-00000075"/> Woolcut was fully persuaded that the work was going on among the rising generation, and that in a few years they would occupy the now vacant pews, as intelligent and zealous converts. His son was able to give glowing accounts of "my parish" to his noble and clerical friends in Dublin. The Hon. Miss Woolcut was perfectly satisfied with the zeal and ability displayed by Mrs. Turner, and showed her approbation by frequent visits to the school in which, during Miss Hudson's administration, she had been almost a stranger. This condescension on the part of the great lady delighted the principal, stimulating her to increased exertions to deserve the confidence reposed in her.</p> 
               <p>The new curate was triumphant. He had not the slightest doubt that he was to be the favored instrument, in the designs of a merciful Providence, to rescue the benighted population of that barbarous region from the slavish thraldom in which Romanism had kept them bound. Therefore, though a partial success had already crowned his efforts, it behooved him not to relax in his energetic proceedings, but to labor in season and out of season to further his great mission. One obstacle in the way of success he was not long in removing. Most of the parents objected to sending their boys to a school in which the renegade Costello was employed as teacher. The parson, admitting the objection to be not altogether without reason, represented the matter to Lord Woolcut so forcibly as to gain his lordship's reluctant consent to the removal of the favorite as a necessary measure. The promising youth was promoted to the office of head teacher in a neighboring town.</p> 
               <p>Having yielded thus far to their prejuices, Mr. Robinson now claimed a corresponding concession from the obliged parties, and never, as they often complained, were unlucky people so badgered and pestered as they were to be henceforth. Sunday and week day, at home and abroad, they were never secure from the minister; he waylaid them coming from church, or fair-he presented himself suddenly at the cottage door, while they were taking their humble meal-he was ubiquitous.</p> 
               <p>"He's worse than all that went before him-sorra one of me knows what's to become of us;" some would sigh with a look of hopeless resignation. While others shook their fists and clenched their teeth in fierce but impotent rage when the parson's back was turned, feeling keenly all the misery and degradation of their lot, and longing<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7227-00000076"/> ing-oh how savagely!-for the power to burst the shackles which English <emph>civilization</emph> had woven round them, poor helpless victims of landlordism.</p> 
               <p>A church festival was always the minister's "field day," for having no "service" to hold at his own church, he had full leisure to devote himself to the enlightenment of the poor creatures who were so far behind the age as to be willing to forego a day's employment occasionally for the sake of worshipping God. This was a theme he loved to dwell upon, in his visits, on such occasions; for, had he not on his side the command, "Six days shalt thou labor"-and was it not self-evident that these constantly recurring Saints'-days and holidays were the true cause of the poverty of the Irish peasantry? How could they hope to attain the enviable condition of England's prosperous yeomanry, while they wasted time that was more precious than gold on such fooleries? This was a matter of scarcely less importance in his view than the promotion of the educational scheme to which, in obedience to the "earnest desire" of Lord Woolcut, he was devoting his best energies.</p> 
               <p>"Isn't that the parson coming up the road?" "Yes, 'tis himself, never welcome him, an' his daughter leaning on his arm." "Now, he'll be at some of us-wisha! are we forever an' always to be bothered wid the likes of him!"</p> 
               <p>These and similar remarks might be heard among St. Stephen's congregation as they left the sacred edifice on a holiday that occurred shortly after Robert Costello's departure.</p> 
               <p>"Blessed Stephen, deliver us from the tempter! Yerself knows what 'tis to suffer for the Church of God." The ejaculation was responded to by earnest "Amens" from all around.</p> 
               <p>"Well, indeed, mother, 'tisn't clear to me but St. Stephen had the easiest suffering-with due respect to him-for I'd sooner be stoned to death any day than be talked to death by a blathernskite of a parson."</p> 
               <p>"That's true for you, Larry Conner, there'd be some satisfaction in <emph>that,</emph> for stoning is a game that two can play at, handy; but you can't bid him hold his prate, or take it where it would be more wanting, without you're as impudent as himself."</p> 
               <p>"Faith, then," said a sturdy looking fellow, "I think 'tis something like that I'll be tellin' him one of those times."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and get yourself turned out o' doors, an' all of us along wid you," interrupted his wife. "'Tis wishin' you'll be that you'd kept<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7227-00000077"/> your tongue behind your teeth when we're all flung out on the roadside."</p> 
               <p>"That's a sensible word as was ever spoke," chimed in another. "Where's the use of talking, man alive? We're in his power, and he knows it well. What are they standing still for, I wonder?"</p> 
               <p>"He's considering maybe, which of us he'll tackle to first."</p> 
               <p>"God put it into his heart to leave us alone to-day," murmured one woman, with a fervor that seemed to gain her prayer, for at that moment the individuals who were so anxiously watched turned off into a footpath that led in another direction. A feeling of relief at their deliverance dispelled the clouds from every countenance; some hurried on to be "out of harm's way," while others gazed curiously after the two gospellors.</p> 
               <p>"I see what they're after," cried one, "they're hurrying to overtake the Regans."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, that's it, Johanna told me herself the minister's been haunting Barney about the children this month past."</p> 
               <p>"Faith, then, Barney won't be the one to baulk him, if there's anything to be gained by it-the idle rogue."</p> 
                
               <p>"See the minister's come up to him now-there they go all together. I'll engage he'll carry his point this time, if he has to go every step of the road with them."</p> 
               <p>The speaker guessed right. Mr. Robinson had placed himself beside Regan, and was addressing him with an earnestness that showed he did not mean to be put off any longer; while his daughter attached herself to the mother and children, whom she accosted in tones of winning cordiality. The former received her advances somewhat coldly. Her native politeness rebelled against holding aloof from the pleasant lady, but she could not overcome a feeling of injury, for she was too well aware of the object of this <emph>chance</emph> meeting.</p> 
               <p>"What a lovely child! Tell me your name, darling." And Mrs. Turner gently took one hand of the youngest child, who was holding tightly to her mother's gown. "Alley? That's a pretty name, pretty enough for its little owner. How I envy you!" she added, turning mournfully to Johanna. "I had a little girl-she would be just the age of this darling had she lived."</p> 
               <p>Johanna's heart softened. With a touch of remorse for her coldness, she turned her eyes more kindly on the bereaved young mother, and<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7227-00000078"/> replied soothingly that that was a grief such as only God and a mother could tell; "but she's with the angels, that's one comfort you have-she's better off than all your love could make her."</p> 
               <p>She stopped abruptly, for a word or two of the minister's discourse reached her, and, as she looked towards him, she encountered her husband's wavering glance that told her but too plainly that he was in a yielding mood.</p> 
               <p>"What d'ye say, Johanna? may the children go to the school?"</p> 
               <p>"Not if word of mine has any weight with you," was the quick and resolute reply.</p> 
               <p>"Come, now, my good woman, don't stand in your children's light," said the minister.</p> 
               <p>"Such bright-looking children, too," chimed in his daughter.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it would be a crime to keep them back. Come, now, be reasonable, my friend: your husband is willing to give them the blessing of a good education if you don't object."</p> 
               <p>"That I always will, then, with the help of God," replied Johanna, stoutly. "I'm not meaning any offence to you, sir; maybe it's all for their good you're striving, but God knows best what's in everybody's heart."</p> 
                
               <p>A violent fit of coughing from the eldest boy, a sickly looking lad of sixteen, checked the minister in what would probably have been a sharp rejoinder.</p> 
               <p>"Your son has a bad cold," said Mrs. Turner. "Has he had it long?"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed he's had it off and on these month's past," answered the mother, who was anxiously regarding him. "It seems, ma'am, as if he's never to get shut of it, poor boy."</p> 
               <p>"I will make him some syrup that will help him; that cough must be cured as soon as possible, or it will wear all his strength away."</p> 
               <p>Johanna gratefully returned thanks for the kind promise. But when the all important theme of the school was resumed, she was as inflexible as ever. However, her opposition availed little. The parson was too shrewd an observer not to understand Regan's weak point. A reduction in his rent was too tempting a bait to hold out to one who, though a good fellow enough in the main, was incorrigibly lazy, and thought the happiest lot in life would be to have nothing to do but smoke a pipe all day long. So, despite all poor Johanna's warning gestures, which he pretended not to see, Barney gave the required promise, and the parson and his daughter turned back well pleased with the result of their walk.</p> 
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7227-00000079"/> 
               <p>"You must be sure to send this little one," were the parting words of Mrs. Turner, as she stooped to kiss Alley's rosy cheek. "She will be my pet, I know."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Barney! Barney! may God forgive you for what you've done this day," burst from the wife in a tone of anguish, as she pursued her homeward way, weeping bitterly."</p> 
               <p>"Hold your whist, woman. Can't you let them have their way for this once."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, an' their way will be to ruin the poor creatures forever. Oh, Barney, it isn't much comfort, we can give the poor things in this world, an' isn't it a cruel thing to rob them of what would make them happy in the next! 'Tisn't for the sake of a few shillings that you'd send them to lose their souls."</p> 
               <p>"Easy talking. If you had to earn the shillings, sorra one of them but you'd know the value of. See here, now, won't it be a fine thing for poor Bernard not to have to work so hard to help me to pay a big rent? And here's Mick, that's got the making of a smart boy in him, as you heard his reverence say, an' indeed 'twasn't the first time he said the same thing, an' that maybe 'twon't be long before he gets to be teacher."</p> 
                
               <p>"The Lord forbid!" interrupted Johanna, with a groan.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, it's in a taken' you are the day, there's no satisfyin' you."</p> 
               <p>"An' after all the warnings of the priest, Heaven be his bed," the mother went on, busy with her own sad thoughts; "it's hard enough he strives to keep us in the right way, an' it won't be him that'll be faulted if we go astray from it. Well, well, may our blessed Lord bring all things right as He only can."</p> 
               <p>The next day saw the young Regans enrolled among the pupils of Lord Woolcut's school</p> 
               <p>"Very encouraging, indeed," remarked his lordship, when informed of this new triumph. "My dear sir, I can never sufficiently express my appreciation of the admirable zeal and tact you display in conducting these difficult negotiations."</p> 
               <p>The minister felt highly elated by such a compliment, coming from so distinguished a source, and hoped his humble efforts would always give satisfaction. His next venture, however, was not quite so successful.</p> 
               <p>Returning from a call on one of his parishioners, he took the long road round by the mountains for the purpose of seeing some of the<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7227-00000080"/> peasants inhabiting that dreary locality, and obtaining some "scholars" from among them. It required a degree of courage little less than that which "carries a man to the cannon's mouth" to nerve the parson for this undertaking, for the people hereabouts unquestionably belonged to that class of demi-civilized beings, possessing all the bad qualities and none of the good ones of the savage, who figured so largely in evangelical reports of "the Irish mission" If the parson looked about him with a sudden and terrifying consciousness of the loneliness of this out-of-the-way region, while recollections of the thousand-and-one outrages which he had read of with shuddering horror forced themselves upon his mind, let us not rashly dub him coward; he was alone, unarmed, and totally unacquainted with the manly science of pugilism-what chance had he if these "Irish boors"-so bloodthirsty and with such a hatred to his cloth, should happen to be in a fierce mood?</p> 
               <p>Musing thus, dreadful images haunting him only the more pertinaciously as he tried to banish them, he came suddenly upon a group of children playing merrily, in utter disregard of the rain that was falling heavily on their half clad forms. "Perfect little savages," he muttered, as he stood a moment observing their boisterous sport, and listening to the "Irish jargon" they were speaking, in happy unconsciousness of a critic's presence. And as he listened a new difficulty presented itself. How was he to make his errand understood by these unfortunate creatures who were so deplorably ignorant of the language of Milton and Shakspere! With a feeling of pitying contempt for the offspring of such wretches, he was passing on, when one of the larger girls suddenly espied him, and by a whisper drew the attention of her companions to him. Some scampered off to their homes in mortal fear of the parson; others peeped out from the shelter of the furze with mingled timidity and boldness at the strange visitor; but the big girl turned coolly to her play once more, maliciously chanting in her strong rough voice, the old nursery rhyme. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Fee, faw, fum!</l> 
                        <l>I smell the blood of an Englishmun;</l> 
                        <l>Be he live or be dead,</l> 
                        <l>I'll grind his bones to make my bread."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>And half a dozen others caught up the strain, echoing loudly the appalling threat. The parson lowered his umbrella over his head and walked rapidly on, his face flushed with anger. Ridiculous<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7227-00000081"/> lous as he knew the feeling to be, he was enraged at the application of the old vulgar rhyme, which he felt sure the rude girl had sung on purpose to vex and mortify him. Nor was the surmise an incorrect one. During Miss Hudson's brief reign as schoolmistress, she had imparted the treasures of nursery lore to most of the children in that neighborhood, and, with the quickness of her race, the girl applied the rhyme suited to the invader.</p> 
               <p>"If such be the children, what reception may I expect from the parents?" thought the chagrined proselytiser; and, but for a feeling of shame, he would have hastily beat a retreat from that unpromising locality. But no. Having put his hand to the plow, he must not look back, so with outward composure he halted at the first dwelling, if dwelling it might be called. A miserable mud cabin-a mere mound of earth-with neither window nor chimney; a doorway so low that he had to stoop almost double to enter it; in the centre of the roof a hole which was to serve for a chimney, but through which the smoke of the smouldering fire of green turf obstinately refused to go, preferring to add to the twilight gloom of the hut, around which the visitor peered for several minutes ere he could see what was before him. Nor did the view, when obtained, recompense his trouble. Furniture there was none, unless a handful of straw in one corner, with some rags by way of bedclothes, might be so designated. Upon this crouched a withered old crone, rocking to and fro, her dudeen adding its quota to the smoke that filled the hut.</p> 
               <p>Squatting in front of the fire, a woman much younger and smarter in appearance, though she had evidently passed the allotted "three-score years and ten," was industriously endeavoring to raise a blaze by fanning the miserable fuel with her apron. She rose as the visitor entered, and curtseying a welcome to "his worship," invited him to approach the fire, an invitation he declined, having sufficient smoke where he stood to satisfy the most inordinate lover of that commodity. Finding to his great relief that the woman could understand him, he quickly made known the object of his visit. The aged crone, hearing a strange voice, managed with no little difficulty to rise and hobble forward a few steps, muttering some unintelligible sounds the while. The parson bowed with the respect due to extreme old age, and inquired after her good health.</p> 
               <p>"She has no English, sir, my poor old mother;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7227-00000082"/> she has only Irish." And with the words she helped to place the feeble old creature back in her former place, talking to her the while in accents of loving tenderness.</p> 
               <p>"About the school you worship was talkin'. Here's the mother of the children comin' now. Judy," turning to a stout, middle-aged woman, who just then made her appearance, with a head of cabbage and some potatoes from the garden, "Judy, this gentleman'll be wantin' to to speak wid you about sendin' the children to school, but sure he can't come in wid the smoke, bad manners to it, for smoke, my heart's just broke wid it." And she betook herself to her former position, trying her might to convert the apron into a bellows.</p> 
               <p>Judy threw back her gown, which had been turned up over her head by way of umberlla, and fixed a pair of searching black eyes on the visitor, whose white neckerchief and black coat proclaimed his vocation, while as if disdaining to address him direct, she rejoined: "About the school, is it? Faith, then, mother, he'll trot back the same's he came barrin' the mud he'll gather on the road.</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Bido hocht avick, sure 'tisn't insultin' his honor you'd be?"</p> 
                
               <p>A guttural "augh! Augh!" was all the answer Judy vouchsafed, accompanied with a turn of the head that spoke more contempt than could be put into words, as with very unnecessary clatter she began to wash the potatoes.</p> 
               <p>"It's offerin' you a seat I'd be, sir," said the older woman, in a tone of deference that seemed intended to compensate for her daughter's ill-manners, "if our poor place would afford the like, but-"</p> 
               <p>"There's a little bench," said Judy, gruffly.</p> 
               <p>The mother, gratified by this concession, spoke more briskly. "So there is, honey, but 'tis myself that's ashamed to offer the likes of it; however,"-and she reluctantly brought forward and old and battered stool, which she began to dust with her apron.</p> 
               <p>"Make no excuses, my good friend,' began the minister, blandly. "It is I that should apologize for this intrusion, but-"</p> 
               <p>Another expressive "augh!" from the bustling Judy gave so ready an assent to his words that he broke off in some confusion.</p> 
               <p>"Why, then, I'm ashamed of you," said the older female, in a stage whisper, and setting down the well-dusted stool, said deprecatingly: "It's sorry I am that it isn't better suited for a<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7227-00000083"/> gentleman like your honor, but 'tis the best we've got-Ohone!"</p> 
               <p>"And it's all we've got-why didn't you tell <emph>the gentleman</emph> that while you was about it, mother? An' if he'd condescend to ask why we've got no more, sure you could send him to Lord Woolcut's agent for the information." The latter words uttered with fierce emphasis.</p> 
               <p>"Then if I know what's got into you the day, Judy," sighed the distressed woman, whose old-fashioned feelings of hospitality were sorely wounded. "Sure the gentleman foment you had nothing to do wid that, and anyway the landlord has a right to his rent, no matter how we raise it."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>No matter,</emph> sure enough. I've heard tell of parts of Ameriky where they can sell a negro slave to raise money, when all other means fail-bedad, like enough there'll be an act of Parliament afore long giving landlords here the same power over their Irish slaves, as Andrew says."</p> 
               <p>"'Tis an awful system-that of American slavery!" began the parson, eagerly seizing the opportunity to dilate on a neutral subject.</p> 
               <p>"There's never a doubt of it, sir," chimed in the mother.</p> 
                
               <p>"Troth, then, if it's worse than Irish slavery it must be worse than the devil himself," interposed the "irrepressible" Judy, who having now got her dinner on and succeeded in raising "a flame" under the pot, was brandishing an old stump of a broom about in the delusion that she was clearing up the hearth. "Bad luck to all landlords and agents, I say, that would grind the face of the poor."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to hear such language from you," said the parson, deeming it his duty to administer a mild rebuke.</p> 
               <p>She turned on him fiercely. "Why, then, who asked you to hear till it? Answer me that, will you? An' if you don't like it, it's easy enough gettin' rid of it; there's the door wide open, an' maybe the sooner you take yourself outside of it the better."</p> 
               <p>The minister arose. There was plainly no use in talking of the blessings of education here. So covering his discomfiture by an assumption of dignity, he said loftily: "I repeat that I am sorry to hear such language from one of your sex. Perhaps after all it is not to be wondered at, though I <emph>had</emph> thought your religion-"</p> 
               <p>"Is it my religion you'd be attacking you black hearted Presbyterian, for that's what you are,<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7227-00000084"/> an' no decent Protestant at all!" roared Judy, coming forward with uplifted broom in so threatening an attitude that the minister was glad to obey her command, to "get out of her sight," and hurried away, the last sound he heard being a shout of triumphant laughter from his enemy, with an ironical "Is it going so soon your reverence is? won't you stop till my man comes home? be dad he'll make thread of you-arrah you'd better wait, honey."</p> 
               <p>Not fancying the promised transformation, the parson was fain to decline the invitation and go his way in no enviable state of mind. Accosting any of the other barbarians was out of the question, and in deep tribulation of spirit, he hastened onward, anxious only to find himself within the quiet precincts of the parsonage, that he might compose his ruffled spirit. But he had not so far to go for consolation, for he soon found himself near the home of "a decent family," converts to Protestanism (<emph>and</emph> Prosperity.) It was the cottage formerly occupied by the Blakes and Costellos, the cottage which had witnessed so many sad scenes in the tragedy by which British Providence pretends to promote "the welfare of the Irish." The cottage and its surroundings had a thriving aspect, so had the tenants, who came out to give eager welcome to the unexpected guest. Ah! how delightful was the contrast-how soothing the respectful attentions shown to <emph>their pastor</emph> and their hypocritical professions of attachment to "<emph>our</emph> church and schools," after the scene from which he came. It was balm to his wounded feelings, to descant on the unpleasant theme, exciting the wonder and indignation of his sympathizing hearers.</p> 
               <p>"There's one family would be better to get hold of than a dozen others," said one in the course of conversation. "That's the O'Loughlins."</p> 
               <p>"I have tried them already," was the reply, "But I must try again."</p>

               <p>THE minister will give you a bad name, I'm afraid, Michael; he thinks it <emph>very</emph> strange that he can never find you at home," said Mrs. O'Loughlin to her husband, as the family were enjoying the noontide meal.</p> 
               <p>A fine family group it was: one which would recall memories of the good old times, when Ireland's "prosperity" was betokened by her ruddy, intelligent, industrious population, rather than by herds of choice cattle, and droves of "splendid fat pigs." Two fine looking young men, full of health and spirit-a graceful maiden in the first bloom of womanhood-six rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed boys and girls ranging from four to fifteen years-made up a group on which the parents' gaze might well linger with loving pride; while the almost reverential affection with which they were regarded, showed how hallowed was the bond that united parent and child in that happy household.</p> 
               <p>The mother's remark was greeted with shouts of laughter, in which the father joined heartily as he replied.</p> 
               <p>"I've escaped his reverence once more; this makes the fifth time, I believe, that I have been unfortunately absent when the representative of 'the State Church' condescended to make a friendly visit to my poor place."</p> 
               <p>"He takes a wonderful interest in you, father," said Katie, with a rougish smile; "regrets exceedingly that he sees you so seldom, and then only for a' moment, for he is quite anxious to have a pleasant chat with one of whom he has heard so much since his coming amongst us."</p> 
               <p>"No doubt of it, but that same pleasant chat won't spoil by keeping."</p> 
               <p>"But where were you at all?" queried the wife, looking not a little puzzled, " Mr. Robinson declared that he could take a solemn oath that he saw you in the kitchen garden as he came up the road."</p> 
               <p>"So could I," said Mark looking slyly at his brother.</p> 
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7227-00000086"/> 
               <p>"I saw him as well, and made no doubt but he was coming to inquire after my good health; but as yourself or the boys could satisfy his kind anxiety on that score, I just stepped into the corn-field hard by to rest awhile. You wouldn't believe, Kathleen, how tired a man gets sometimes, and what a fine place that field is to rest in when the corn is as high as it is just now."</p> 
               <p>"Or to bide in from unwelcome visitors," said Frank. "The men and ourselves searched diligently, under the parson's direction, but father was nowhere to be found, though we could all say that he was <emph>there</emph> just a little while before."</p> 
               <p>"So we got rid of him at your expense, mother, by suggesting that father <emph>might</emph> have gone to the house. Did he stay long?"</p> 
               <p>"The best part of an hour, I believe," replied Mrs. O'Loughlin.</p> 
               <p>"Or rather the worst part of it, Kathleen."</p> 
               <p>"Well, indeed, I had no fault to find with him; he was quite friendly and pleasant. He had some funny anecdotes to tell of his former parish; and then he began to talk of his present charge."</p> 
               <p>"And so edged around to the schools, I warrant."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he spoke warmly of the interest his son and daughter take in the children's improvement; but when he hinted the great advantage it would be to my little ones to go to such excellent schools, I put a stop to his eloquence very civilly by telling him that their father had all to say in that matter."</p> 
               <p>"What a submissive wife he must think you," said her husband, laughingly. "I suppose that sent him off, and indeed 'twas full time."</p> 
               <p>"We were all on the watch to see him go," said Mark, "but we began at last to think he had stolen a march on us, though Tim Dooley was 'ready to make affidavit that not so much as a chicken could go out of the yard unbeknown to him, let alone the parson.'"</p> 
               <p>"I would have sent Stephen to the field to let you know he was gone," said Mrs. O'Loughlin, "only I was afraid he might see the child and suspect something; though, for that matter, I believe he had his suspicions as it was."</p> 
               <p>"He's welcome to them if they serve to keep him quiet for the future. He made me lose time that's more precious with me than with him just now, and the loss would have been still greater only for Katie here."</p> 
               <p>"So you understood pay signal, father?"</p> 
               <p>"To be sure I did, my beauty," replied the<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7227-00000087"/> father, looking with proud affection on his oldest daughter. "What hour of day was that to be shaking out a tablecloth?"</p> 
               <p>"That same tablecloth got a good shaking," said Frank, laughing, as they rose from the table. "Be sure always to have a good strong one handy for that purpose, Katie. 'The boys' wanted to answer your signal by a hurrah; but, like mother, we had a wholesome fear of the minister being spying about; so you'll have to take the will for the deed, Katie dear."</p> 
               <p>"If 'tis just the same to you, I'll take neither the one nor the other," said his sister, with a toss of her. pretty head.</p> 
               <p>"Come, now, Mistress Kathleen, don't be hard on the decent fellows," replied Frank, demurely. "I know, indeed, that it is quite <emph>another sort</emph> of a <emph>will</emph> you'd prefer taking, but-"</p> 
               <p>A smart box on the ear interrupted him. There was a playful scuffle between brother and sister, which ended in the young man being pushed out of doors, beaten bat not vanquished, for as he passed the window near which stood the laughing girl, rosy and panting after her victory, he gave her a nod of saucy defiance, and went slowly forward, singing some impromptu words to a favorite air:

               <p>If the fair Kathleen's face had been rosy before, it might well be called crimson now.</p> 
               <p>"Isn't that pretty Nell Joyce coming up the road?" she called out tauntingly. But Frank was too far off to be disturbed by the malicious insinuation: so she had to content herself with muttering-"Never mind-I'll be even with you some of these days, my fine fellow!"-as she hastened to help her mother in the various household duties claiming her attention.</p> 
               <p>There was great rejoicing in Bartrymore. Bonfires blazed among the hills; loud shouts and huzzas were given with a will; amateur musicians made the air resound with the stirring notes of "St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." True there were no great processions, or triumphant arches, or bands of martial music, to give eclat, to the occasion, and the gentry laughed at the humble demonstration; but there was enthusiasm such as not the arrival of the whole royal family of England could have awakened in those true Irish hearts, and there were heartfelt blessings and sobs of joy mingling with the welcoming shouts that rent the air, as William O'Loughlin,<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7227-00000088"/> the noble young <emph>felon,</emph> stepped once more upon the soil his boyish feet had trod.</p> 
               <p>He had left it a high spirited, ardent, impetuous boy, glorying in the title of felon and rebel; rejoicing that he could suffer for his country, since he might not fight for her; exulting in the hope (alas, as delusive as it was glorious!) that a rebellion had been begun which would never end until it had wrought the great work of Ireland's independence. He returned to it an earnest, thoughtful man, as warm-hearted if less buoyant, as enthusiastic if less hopeful than of old. Had he learned to regard his former feelings as foolish? his boyhood's hope as a "fleeting dream," to be remembered only with regret that he had sacrificed to it "so many of his best years," Ah! pitiful must be the spirit, unmanly the heart in which banishment or all the torture that tyrants' power can inflict, will work <emph>repentance</emph> or submission to the tyrant's will.</p> 
               <p>The young O'Loughlin's was not such a nature. Tears of penal exile had but burned deeper into his mind the story of Ireland's wrongs, had but intensified his abhorrence of "Anglo-Saxon rule"-his vehement desire to see it broken forever-"Ireland a Nation!" Yes. Second only to his own hope of a glorious immortality was his hope of the nationality of Ireland-dearer to him than ever was the name of Irishman-more welcome to him the title of rebel and traitor to British rule in Ireland, than all the titles and rewards of loyalty a "gracious Sovereign" could deign to bestow on willing slaves.</p> 
               <p>These were some of the sentiments he expressed when receiving the "hundred thousand welcomes" from his former companions and friends, all boys together once more, throwing off with genuine Celtic facility the cares and anxieties that manhood had brought to them all; and loud and long were the shouts that hailed his speech, as hand clasped hand in a pledge of unswerving fidelity to the dear old land. Such meetings and re-unions, though they may be sneered at and derided as <emph>cheap</emph> patriotism, have still one grand result: they help to keep alive in the Irish heart the sacred fire of loyalty to the country, of disloyalty to "the stranger." Passive love soon dies out; action alone can keep it alive. Then let the love of country, if it may not be shown by deeds, manifest itself by words, keeping alive the sacred flame until the dawning of that longed-for day when Ireland, once more unrolling her Sunburst, will call her children to assemble under its gorgeous folds, and strike nobly for "God and their native land."</p> 
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7227-00000089"/> 
               <p>Young O'Loughlin could not tarry long in Ireland. He was resolved never to make his home there while it was under British rule. He must seek a home in the New World, the land of promise, to which the Irishman's heart turns as to "a second mother country." He had money to buy a farm which should be all own, untroubled bye the fear of governments and landlords, and his preparations were soon made for a voyage across the Atlantic. He went but not alone. Kathleen, the pet of his boyhood the beloved correspondent during his years of exile, was with him, a happy, loving bride. Blessings and good wishes accompanied them, and many, recollecting the parting words of the young patriot-"I will come back <emph>as soon as the work begins</emph>"-indulged the hope of seeing him once more in his native land at no distant day.</p> 
               <p>A few evenings after the departure of the young couple, two or three friends dropped in at the O'Loughlin's to spend a social hour after the labours of the day. The wedding and its attendant circumstances having been disposed of, they turned to that unfailing topic of the day, the parson's zeal for proselytizing.</p> 
               <p>"You've managed to keep all your little ones safe out of his clutches yet, Mr. O'Loughlin," said one.</p> 
                
               <p>"Yes, and with the help of God I shall always keep them so."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I hope you may be able, but there's no telling. He's a persevering man, that same minister; and you have so many young children it isn't easy <emph>denying</emph> them. You can't hide them as Cavan did his."</p> 
               <p>"How was that-did he hide Bridget from the minister?" asked Mrs. O'Loughlin.</p> 
               <p>"He just did. You see he was lucky enough to know when the parson was coming; so he just put her behind him, and when Mr. Robinson began to palaver, he pointed easy like to the cradle where his little grandchild was asleep, and says he, 'Hadn't your reverence better take cradle and all?'"</p> 
               <p>"That was a cute trick in Cavan, but Dan Coyle played a still better one on the parson. Mrs. Turner, it seems, heard that Dan had a smart little girl, that it would be well to get into the school; but when the parson went for her, never a girl was in Dan's cabin but widow Nelly's strapping daughter that he had borrowed for the occasion. Says the minister, 'I thought you had a younger daughter, Coyle. This young woman is almost too tall to send to school, I fear.' 'I was thinking the same myself, sir,' says he as<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7227-00000090"/> meek as a lamb;' bit didn't he dance and sing with glee when the minister was well out of hearing?"</p> 
               <p>"I wonder if they have got little Nancy Monaghan yet," said Mrs. O'Loughlin. "Last time I saw her mother, she was in great trouble about her. It would be too bad if they got her into the school; such a smart, good little thing as she is, too."</p> 
               <p>"That's what she is," chuckled one of the visitors. O she's safe enough for a while. Havn't you heard of their meeting wid the minister last Sunday?"</p> 
               <p>"Not a word."</p> 
               <p>"Why, then, ma'am dear, the three of them-father, mother and child-were coming home from Vespers, when who should they meet but the minister and the schoolmaster? There was no avoiding them; so when Mr. Robinson began to talk of the child, what does my brave pair do but run off as fast as their four feet would carry them, leaving Nancy to get out of the scrape the best way she could."</p> 
               <p>"Poor child! how frightened she must have been."</p> 
               <p>"Faith, then, she managed it better than the biggest of us could ever think of, I'll be bound. She began to cry, of course, and was for following her, parents the first thing; and when the two gentlemen hindered her and began their questions and soft talk, not a word could they get out of her but Irish."</p> 
               <p>There was a hearty burst of laughter from all present.</p> 
               <p>"Success to little Nancy! They were glad to let her go, I'm thinking."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, she says the minister told the other to let her go her ways; there could be nothing done in the school with such a creature."</p> 
               <p>"I wonder what scheme they'll try next for making converts," said Mrs. O'Loughlin, in a sad tone. "They have tried the virtue of famine and soup-houses and bible-reading, without success. Now they are trying to lead the poor children astray."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and isn't it a cruel shame that we must either give up the poor little creatures to their teaching, or run the risk of seeing ourselves and them turned out of house and home?"</p> 
               <p>"It is an accursed system, and one that will work harm to its authors yet," said Michael O'Loughlin. "Was ever such a thing heard of in a Christian land-aye, even in a heathen one for that matter-that fathers and mothers, who<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7227-00000091"/> are trying to do their duty by the little ones God has given to their care, must see them led off to places where they will learn to despise alike their parents, their country and creed!"</p> 
               <p>"Father!" cried one of the children, running in almost out of breath, "I see the minister coming this way, and Mrs. Turner is with him, and another lady-Lord Woolcut's daughter, I think."</p> 
               <p>The guests started in a body to the door, anxious only to escape the dread trio. O'Loughlin rushed towards the adjoining room, but no! the invaders would be sure to search for him there. He looked around despairing-a huge chest in one corner seemed, to offer shelter: he crouched between it and the wall, and his wife L had just time to fling a pile of clothes over it, put the light on the other side of the room, and pretend to be busy with her needle, when the unwelcome party made their appearance.</p> 
               <p>"An unseasonable visit, I fear you will think, Mrs. O'Loughlin," said the parson, in his most cordial tone, and with his ever ready smile; "but we chose an hour when your husband would be most likely to be found at home, having particular business with him. Where is he?"</p> 
               <p>The ladies had meanwhile taken seats, and Mrs. O'Loughlin avoided the necessity of replying by affecting to give her entire attention to them. But Mr. Robinson was not to be put off. He repeated his question with some asperity.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed he was here a few moments ago," said the perplexed wife. "A few friends were sitting with us"-and turning towards the children, but not looking at them, she added, "could he have stepped out with any of them?"</p> 
               <p>Poor Mrs. O'Loughlin was a novice at equivocation; the three pairs of sharp eyes fixed upon her saw through her at once. Mr. Robinson announced his intention of making a thorough search for the missing member of the family. He glanced towards the neighboring apartment as he spoke, but happening to see one of the children glance furtively at the chest, he sprang towards it, and quickly discovered the object of his search, who finding concealment useless, come forward laughing good-humoredly at his own discomfiture as he respectfully saluted his fail visitors.</p> 
               <p>"That is not right, O'Loughlin," said the minister, in a tone of raillery. "Even if you were determined not to show hospitality to me, I should think an Irishman's gallantry would forbid him running away from the ladies."</p> 
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7227-00000092"/> 
               <p>"True for you, sir," said O'Loughlin. "But your reverence knows well we must flee from temptation; and when a poor Irishman sees fair ladies coming as he fears to besiege him to do something his conscience forbids, what can he do but run away, since his gallantry makes him loth to say nay to the charming tempters?"</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to find you willing to admit the necessity of yielding," said Mrs. Turner, glancing smilingly at O'Loughlin and then at the Bishop's daughter; "for we have come this evening determined to take no denial, so you may as well yield with a good grace. May he not, Mrs. O'Loughlin?"</p> 
               <p>Very pleasant was the lady's tone, and her manner full of that grace and persuasiveness on which she particularly prided herself, but the distressed parents might be pardoned for deeming her imperious and disagreeable. Yet what could they do? The minister took up the subject, and it was vain to offer any excuse for not sending the children to the Lord Bishop's schools. The father represented that the oldest girls were required at home, particulaly since Kathleen's departure, to help their mother; but this plea was met by a proposition from Mrs. Turner that they might come on alternate days, when they could not both be spared. And the minister and Miss Woolcut intimated pretty plainly that Kathleen's marriage to a contumacious rebel like her cousin had brought the family under suspicion; and that if her father wished to retain his land it behooved him not to give further offence to his lordship, the Lord Bishop. So the visit ended as might have been foreseen. The zealous trio departed triumphantly, leaving sad hearts where they had found peace and happiness. The parents blamed themselves for a compliance extorted from them, but still the question arose-what else could they have done? Ah, bitter question! Henceforth remorse would embitter every hour; they could but pray that their children's faith might be preserved amid the temptations to which they were unhappily obliged to expose them.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Regans.</head> 
               <p>IT was a rainy day of the old-fashioned, genuine sort, such as can nowhere be <emph>enjoyed</emph> in greater perfection than in Ireland during the fall of the year. A rainy day in the spring is pleasant and cheering. One can almost see the brown boughs swell and brighten with the promise of coming leafiness-the springing grass takes a softer hue-the fields of early grain hold up their slender spears to receive the precious liquid which is to contribute its share to the plenteousness of the harvest-the streamlets, released from their icy fetters, swell fuller and broader as they go singing through woodland and meadow-there is beauty, and life, and promise in a spring rain.</p> 
               <p>And in summer, what can be more welcome than a rainy day after a long spell of drought and heat! The parched earth greedily drinks the bright gift of the clouds-the drooping flowers hold up their cups for the pearly drops, and, gaining a new lease of beauty, give thanks by bursting into gayer bloom, and shedding a delicious aroma on the pure, cool breeze-the lowliest specimen of the vegetable creation brightens into beauty under its sprays and clusters of diamonds and pearls-the bright surface of pond and lake breaks into a thousand dimples-the beasts of the field mutely welcome the refreshing shower-bath-and man, the proud lord of creation, whose energy and spirit had yielded to the enervating influence of the heated spell, feels new life and strength in every nerve.</p> 
               <p>Even in winter, a rainy day, if disagreeable, has yet its compensations. It breaks in on the monotony of frost and snow, and tells that winter is breaking up; that the rigid rule of the ice-king is coming to an end. But in the autumn, when the fruits of the earth have been gathered in, and the bright glory of the changing season has passed, a rainy day has not one redeeming feature to win for it welcome or even tolerance. The rain comes with no soft, soothing fall-no cheery "pat, patter"-but hour after hour it drizzles down from the leaden clouds with a dull, dogged obstinacy, holding forth no prospect of a let-up, for as it is to-day it will probably be to-morrow and the day after.</p> 
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7227-00000094"/> 
               <p>Late in the afternoon of such a day a woman stood at the door of a cabin, looking out upon a dreary expanse of waste grounds and bleak hills. Her face pale, anxious and careworn, yet with a mild, lovable expression, told a sad tale of long-continued suffering and privation patiently endured. If to the spoiled favorite of fortune, surrounded by all the appliances of home-comfort, that "tiresome rain" was exasperating and intolerable, to her, as marking the commencement of the dreary winter, it might well seem appalling. For poverty-hopeless, pinching poverty was her portion, even in the bright summer-time, and in winter-O! none but the good God whose fatherly care extends to every one of His creatures can know how life is supported during the long winter by those whose utter destitution allows no provision to be made against its inclemency.</p> 
               <p>And what a miserable place was that for human beings to inhabit! The damp, mouldy walls; the thatched roof, black and decayed; the loose, shrunken casements, which, if they offered but little light to the interior, gave admittance to the rain and the wind; all presented an aspect of repulsive wretchedness. In summer this was not so apparent. When the time-stained walls were covered with creeping vines, and the blackened thatch and crumbling eaves hidden by the feathery foliage of the elm that now, gaunt and bare, was creaking dismally in the wind, it was one of those "picturesque thatched cabins," that made so pretty a feature in the wild magnificence of Connaught scenery. But now that the fall sprites had rudely torn away its few poor adornments, it stood revealed in its true character as a miserable, dilapidated hovel, from which those would turn away in disgust who had lately pronounced it quite sweet-a cosy little spot. Its external aspect was a true indication of its interior. The two small rooms, with smoke-blackened walls and mud floors worn into hollows, were but scantily supplied with the poorest kind of household goods, to which no labor could impart a look of tidiness or comfort. Yet this wretched cabin was the abode of seven human beings.</p> 
               <p>No wonder that poor Johanna Regan felt sad and forlorn as she stood in the doorway that bleak November afternoon, gazing over the dreary expanse of hill and dale, as if in search of something to divert her thoughts from the ever present burden of care and misery. But the scene presented nothing to cheer or beguile her<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7227-00000095"/> mind. The cold rain that had shorn her poor hut of its beauty, had as ruthlessly despoiled the landscape of the last remnant of autumnal glory. Forests, hills and hedges were all alike bleak and dreary; the earth soaked and bare, with deep puddles, and gullies, and hollows, half choked with withered leaves; the leaden sky frowning down pitilessly over all. Never had the long-tried woman been so utterly cast down; trials and troubles were accumulating, and she felt herself completely miserable and forsaken. Had she forgotten that gracious promise?-"I will be with thee in six troubles, and in the seventh I will not forsake thee!" Ah! to all the poor children of affliction there comes a season of doubt and gloom, when this world is only a place of misery insupportable, and heaven seems <emph>very far away</emph>-when the worn spirit, tortured and tried by struggles that seem to have no end, yield unconsciously to the tempter's darkest wiles, and for a moment abandons itself to gloomy despair.</p> 
               <p>But see! down yonder hillside comes a boyish form, taking no heed of drizzling rain or cutting wind, though his thin garments are but poor protection against the weather. Down he comes, springing over ruts and gullies, dashing through puddles too wide for a leap, bounding onward in breathless haste, yet instinctively, as it were, choosing the spots which offer fewest obstacles to his progress. And now his quick eyes have caught a glimpse of the lonely figure at the cabin door, and he checked his headlong speed to get breath for a loud shout. She does not see him yet; her eyes are fixed vacantly on some far off object.</p> 
               <p>"Mother! oh, mother!"</p> 
               <p>The loud, joyous call brings back her wandering thoughts; she turns, and with eyes now brightened with love, watches the boy who is bounding forward. She has scarcely time to wonder at his unexpected appearance, ere he stands beside her, panting for breath, his cheeks in a hot glow, his eyes ablaze with pleasurable excitement.</p> 
               <p>"What brings you home so early, acushla?" is the mother's first thought; her second, ere he has time to answer her-"Mickey, child, how wet you are! come to the fire an' take off your jacket till I dry it-dear, dear."</p> 
               <p>"No, mother-I've no time to stop. I haven't got a minute-"</p> 
               <p>"But you're wet from head to foot, poor boy."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, never mind that, mother. I'll be wetter<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7227-00000096"/> still before many minutes," and the careless laughter of boyhood rang out merrily. "I have only come to tell you my good luck. Just think, mother-I'm to be 'Paid Monitor' after New Year's! isn't that grand? The master told it to me this afternoon as a secret, so nobody must know it but you-and Bernard, of course. Then I shall have some money to bring you now and then, mother dear; and see here, mother;" and the excited boy put a shilling and a few pence inte her hand.</p> 
               <p>"God be praised for sending me this relief," said the mother: "but, Mickey, tell me, where did you get all this money."</p> 
               <p>"Dr. Hunter stopped at the school and gave me the shilling for going of an errand to one of his patients. He had forgotten to leave some directions with the nurse, and didn't want to go back. And the nurse was at a sad loss for some snuff," added the boy laughing, "so I got it for her, and she told me to keep the change. And now I must run back to school."</p> 
               <p>"What for, Micky? Sure school will be out by the time you get there."</p> 
               <p>"That's my reason for hurrying. The <emph>children</emph> will be coming home, and <emph>I can't trust Alley with Pat-he's too wild,</emph>" said Mickey very gravely. "He would think no harm in getting her to run down the hills after him, and they so slippery now from the rain. So I must hurry to meet them. But, say, mother," how wistful the bright eyes grew as he pressed nearer to whisper, "may I have a penny to get one of Granny Joyce's little custards for Bernard, he's so fond of them, mother, and they're only a penny, and 'tis long since he had one."</p> 
               <p>"God help you, agra! one would think 'twas for yourself you're pleading. Yes, to be sure you can get one, but, Mickey, 'tisn't in your way back to the school."</p> 
               <p>"O, 'tis only a little further, I'll run there as I go, mother."</p> 
               <p>"Go, then, an' Heaven's blessin' go wid you, good boy that you are, always thinkin' of the sick brother," said the woman pressing a kiss on the open brow of her open-hearted child, "an' here, Micky, take the rest of the pennies an' buy some gingerbread that you'll be eating as you come home, an' mind, now, that you keep a share of it to yourself," she called after the boy, as with a bright glance he bounded away.</p> 
               <p>"Sure, it's seldom they get a mouthful of what they like, the creatures-nothin' but Indian meal an' potatoes, an' not always enough of them<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7227-00000097"/> same," she said to herself, as she watched the form that rapidly disappeared. Then with a heart lightened of half its load of care by this little incident, she turned back into the cabin, stirred up the smoky turf to a blaze, and got out a few well patched garments for the children, who, as she murmured "wouldn't have a dry thread on them by the time they got home-the creatures!" Next she stepped lightly into the inner room, and bent over a miserable bed; its occupant was asleep, so gathering the covering more closely around him, she stole back to the kitchen, to muse over "Mickey's" news, which, though seemingly a piece of good luck, she could not help considering as a misfortune. The salary he would receive as "Paid Monitor" would be of great help; that was undeniable: but she had never been able to regard the children's attendance at Lord Woolcut's school as anything but a snare laid for their faith. And now to give further countenance to the proselytizing institution, by having her boy engaged as one of its teachers-the thought was a grievous one to the faithful, simple-hearted woman. She could not thank God for the prospect of relief thus afforded, for she <emph>felt</emph> that He was not the author of this good luck.</p> 
                
               <p>"No, no!" she said half aloud and shaking her head sadly, "I could praise the Lord for putting it into the minds of others to employ Mickey this day, an' by this means sending us the help so wanted sore; but I can't thank Him for having my boy employed among the enemies of His Church, an' being, maybe, the means of drawing others into the snare. An' Mickey, he's a good pious child, our Lady be praised! but still he's only a child, an' what if they lead him astray, for now he'll be more under their eyes, as I may say, an' minister, an' teachers, an' sexton, will all be tryin' to pervert him."</p> 
               <p>This thought was a terrible one to the faithful mother, but what could she do? She could only pray and watch over her children more carefully than ever, and carry her new trouble to the saintly priest whose time was ever at the disposal of his flock-he would advise her. And by New Year's her husband would be at home-(he was away at work now on a distant part of his lordship's property,) and perhaps by that time he would be disposed to give some heed to her fears, and remove his children from the influences she dreaded.</p> 
               <p>The school was more than a mile distant, and the short afternoon was giving place to dusky<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7227-00000098"/> twilight, when, under Mickey's leadership, the three children reached their home. Running up to their mother for a welcoming "hug," they proceeded at her desire to change their dripping garments for those she had "airing." Mick had brought a little parcel of something beside the custard, and to his mother's question, "Why, then, what have you there, Mickey?"-spoken less through curiosity than from her habit of taking an interest in all their little affairs-he, with mingled shyness and pleasure opened the paper, and displayed a bit of coarse fresh beef.</p> 
               <p>"To-morrow is wash-day, you know, mother, an we thought you'd like a cup of hot broth."</p> 
               <p>The mother looked with swelling heart from one to another of the little group, now turning away to hide the conscious smiles and blushes that sprung so naturally to the faces of happy, affectionate children. With a gush of emotion she embraced the loving boys and girls who had denied themselves the rare treat of gingerbread in order to afford "a cup of broth" to their mother, and while eagerly lavishing on them kisses and caresses, murmured, "Oh, then, may our Father in heaven pardon all my want of trust in His never failing mercy! an' may He bless you, each an' every one, for good children that you are, ever an' always! 'Tis quick enough I am at counting my troubles an' woes, when I should rather be thinking of all the blessings our good God sends me."</p> 
               <p>"Now darlings," she added, "you may be setting the table while I go see after our poor Bernard."</p> 
               <p>Setting the table was an important business, in which Pat and Susy, and little Alley all liked to take a part. It was now accomplished with no little bustle and merriment, and the tallow candle in its wooden candlestick placed in the centre, to give brilliancy to the supper table, ere the mother and Mickey emerged from the inner room, sustaining the feeble steps of Bernard, the ailing boy, whom consumption had plainly marked as its victim. He was soon placed at the warmest side of the table, with Mickey close at hand to attend to him with loving solicitude, while the mother proceeded to put the food on the table.</p> 
               <p>"I knew you had cakes, mother," said Susy; "I smelt them baking when I came home."</p> 
               <p>"And so did I," chimed in Pat; while Alley, the pet youngest one, clapped her little hands gleefully at sight of the corn cakes which were to constitute the evening repast.</p> 
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7227-00000099"/> 
               <p>A carefully twisted paper was laid before Bernard, who with languid curiosity began to unroll it, as he said with a wan smile, "I know just what this is, mother; it's one of Peg Joyce's custards, isn't it, now? Say, Mickey?"</p> 
               <p>Glad tears moistened the eyes of "Mother" and "Mickey," as they saw the pleasure this anticipation gave him; and the children paused in their eager enjoyment of the cakes to watch Bernard curiously, it was seldom that they now heard his once merry voice.</p> 
               <p>"Why then, where would we be getting a custard?" said Johanna, humoring him; "you must give another guess, Bernard, darling."</p> 
               <p>"It's one of Peg's custards an' nothing else," persisted the sick lad. "If 'tisn't I lose my guess-there, now, I'm wrong after all, for 'tis <emph>two</emph> of them." With a feeble attempt at merriment he held up his treasures, "you were right, mother, 'tisn't <emph>a</emph> custard you'd be getting, but custards-oh, but they're beauties!" and his hollow eyes lighted up faintly as he surveyed the rare treat.</p> 
               <p>"Why, then, it puzzles me to know where the two came from."</p> 
               <p>"I know," said Micky, "I asked Granny to pick me out a nice brown one, for Bernard likes them brown, and her daughter at the same moment asked how Bernard was getting; so while I was answering her, Peg just slipped in two custards for the price of one."</p> 
               <p>"Long life to her," said Johanna, "she has a good heart if she had but the means of showing it. Though, indeed, wherever a good heart is, it finds some way of showing itself, an' that Peg Joyce proves to us. No, agra, not a morsel," this to Bernard, who was insisting that she would share his dainties-"nor the children either," giving them a warning look to refuse, which they did with cheerful obedience.</p> 
               <p>"We're having hot cakes all to ourselves, Master Bernard," added Pat. "Oh, but they are good."</p> 
               <p>"That they are," said Susy; "why don't you make them for us often, mother?"</p> 
               <p>"I like them ever so much better than stirabout," chimed in Alley.</p> 
               <p>"Do you then, darling?" said the mother, evading an answer to Susan. She had not the heart to tell them that the precious corn meal <emph>went further</emph> in the homely stirabout than in the more palatable form of hot cakes. "You'll have to get some more meal before you go to school in the morning, children: the last dust I had of it went in them cakes, but Mickey's shilling will<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7227-00000100"/> get us some more, praise be to Him that sends us the help always when we're in greatest need."</p> 
               <p>"You're not going back to bed right away, Bernard, agra," she said, as Susey was helping her to clear the table; "You're looking so much better to-night, may be you could sit with us a bit."</p> 
               <p>Yes, Bernard was better, and more lively than for many a day past, owing to the little excitement attending the unusual feast; and he gladly took possession of the chimney corner; while the mother sat down to the sewing by which she earned an occasional shilling or sixpence, among the villagers who were better off or less handy than herself; and the children drew close around the table with their books, to learn the lessons for the following day. For a time there was silence, save when Mickey interrupted his studies to relate something which might serve to amuse "mother" or Bernard.</p> 
               <p>"What's that you're at now, Mick?" said the latter presently.</p> 
               <p>"Geography."</p> 
               <p>"Is it an interesting part? read us some of your next lesson."</p> 
               <p>Mickey complied.</p> 
               <p>"That's not as interesting as the big geography the master lets you learn out of sometimes, is it, Mick?" said Pat. "My but <emph>that's</emph> hard though."</p> 
               <p>"I like it better than this. The lesson I had in it day before yesterday was a fine one," and Mickey threw back the clustering hair from his forehead and repeated the lesson he deemed so interesting.</p> 
               <p>"Why, how can you keep it in your head from one day to another?" asked Pat, who had listened in astonishment to the accurate recitation. "I study my tasks well-you know, Mickey, I always keep at the head of my class-but as soon as I have repeated them to the master I forget all about them."</p> 
               <p>"Then what's the use of your learning them at all?" said sensible Mickey. "As long as we have to go where we should not go by right, we ought to try to gain all the good we can from it, as mother often tells us. And where's the use of the knowledge if 'tis forgotten as soon as learned."</p> 
               <p>"But the tasks are so hard," grumbled Pat.</p> 
               <p>"Hard! I'm ashamed of you-such baby lessons for a great fellow like you. But keep to your books, Bernard is company to-night, and I must not neglect him to talk to you."</p> 
               <p>Bernard smiled faintly on the bright, handsome<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7227-00000101"/> some boy who now turned to him with an expression of unutterable fondness.</p> 
               <p>"You're a lucky fellow, Mickey, to be learning out of all them fine books," he said with a sigh. "Learning's a grand thing. I remember when I used to be longing for a chance of it;" he paused for a moment, then noticing the troubled look of his mother and brother, he added with an effort to speak cheerfully, "But I'll soon have more knowledge than any of you, and that without studying for it-please God, I'll be where is all the wisdom and knowledge before long."</p> 
               <p>A stifled sob broke from the mother. Unwilling to disturb the brief respite he was now enjoying from the weakness that was gradually wearing his young life away, she stooped down pretending to fix the fire, but finding that resource fail, betook herself to the inner room to give vent to her anguish and seek the strength and endurance needful to support her under this sorrow. Hard was it to a mother's heart to know that that dear boy was slowly but surely going down to the grave-harder yet to feel her inability to make the brief remnant of his existence comfortable and happy. He looked after her with wistful eyes: the only grief that the knowledge of his early doom caused him, was the thought of leaving that tender mother.</p> 
                
               <p>"You will take care of her, Mick," he said to the brother who had thrown his arms around the invalid with passionate fondness. "You'll be more to my mother than ever I could be, for you are strong and hearty, and have good chances that you're making the most of. So that you are like to do well-but hush! here she comes."</p> 
               <p>"This is my history," said Mick pleasantly, making an effort to dispel the gloom that now pervaded the little circle. "After all, though, I like all my books well enough, this is the pleasantest task-<emph>pleasantest!</emph> what would become of me if the master heard me say that?"</p> 
               <p>"Whew, but you'd get a scolding-he'd think you were taking pattern by Jim Connor," said Pat with a loud laugh, in which Mick joined.</p> 
               <p>"How's that?" asked Bernard.</p> 
               <p>"Well, you see," began Mick, "Mr. Turner declares it's almost as bad as an emetic to him to hear our barbarous Irish way of confusing and confounding the comparatives and superlatives. He talks by the half hour to the second grammar class about being 'careful of their adjectives,' but 'tis no manner of use, they persist in misunderstanding him, especially Jim Connor, the great rogue, who pretends to take immense pains to learn the rules, but in vain. The master will call<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7227-00000102"/> out-'Who was that just now said <emph>delightfullest?</emph>' or, 'What boy was it that said another of the scholars was <emph>knowinger</emph> than himself? It was James Connor, I'll warrant. How often must I tell you, sir, that in such cases the degrees of comparison must be expressed by <emph>more</emph> and <emph>most,</emph> not by <emph>er</emph> and <emph>est?</emph> Never let me hear such barbarisms from you again. Jim: <emph>always</emph> say most delightful-more knowing-and so on.' 'Yes, sir, I'll be sure and think of it from this out, sir,' Jim will reply as meek as a lamb, and the very same day perhaps, Mr. Turner will hear him saying-'This is the most fine jacket I ever had,' or, 'His knife is more sharper than mine.' Then you ought to hear the master call! Gracious! he makes us all jump. 'More of your stupid blunders, Master Jim-will you never learn that words of one syllable are compared by er and est, <emph>not</emph> by more and most?' To which Jim makes answer-'An' sure, sir, 'twas only just now you told me to let you hear no more of my er and est-you called them barbarians, or some such name, indeed you did, master dear.' Then the master loses patience-a common habit with him-and tries to make his bright scholar understand the er and est-more and most, by a touch of his cane; and a few days afterwards when he has forgotten the whole matter, Jim renews the trouble by some such gibberish as-'It's the most harder lesson we ever had.' Then there is a renewal of former scenes, but all of no avail, for it was only yesterday that Jim almost put the master in a fit by declaring that 'of all inventions of man or devil, them same comparatives and superlatives were the most hatefulerest.' You Pat, stop screeching as if you were out on the mountains."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, we had all like to split," cried Pat, trying to check his boisterous mirth at the recollection, "and, Bernard, you never saw a madder man than the teacher."</p> 
               <p>"Master Jim is more impudent than ignorant, I think," said Bernard, after the laughter had subsided.</p> 
               <p>"To be sure he is; he's impudenter, as he would say, than all the rest of the boys together."</p> 
               <p>"But why does the master allow it? that's what seems strange to me," said the disapproving mother.</p> 
               <p>"Because he cannot help it," replied Mick. "Why, mother, Jim is the very picture of innocence on such occasions, and though Mr. Turner may think that it is all assumed for the purpose of blinding him, still he cannot be positive."</p> 
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7227-00000103"/> 
               <p>"Is that Andrew Connor's Jim? But no, of course it isn't: his children are all past the age for sendin' to school."</p> 
               <p>"But he sends one there for all that, mother. Mr. Turner met him soon after taking charge of the school, it seems, and discoursed so eloquently on the advantages flowing from a good education, that the poor man was quite overpowered with grief at having no gossoon of an age to enjoy these advantages. <emph>Will</emph> you be quiet, Pat? You're always the noisiest fellow."</p> 
               <p>"O mother, you'd most die of laughing if you heard Jim describe it," interposed the noisy fellow.</p> 
               <p>"Besides," resumed Mick, "Andrew thought it a shameful thing to be refusing a stranger, so while he was mumbling out in some way his excuses for 'having no children just now to send to his honor, seeing that they were all somewhat grown as one might say.' Mr. Turner interrupted him in his careless way, 'Yes, yes; of course they are useful to you, and a poor man can scarcely be expected to spare his children when they get large enough to help him. But is there none of them you could spare for a time? the youngest, say, or some one that is not so good at working? 'Why, indeed, says Connor, 'the youngest one's a bit of an idler, an' I 'spose I could spare him at times, but-' Here he broke down, and Mr. Turner began to urge him by all means to send the boy. 'I'm afraid he won't be willin' to go, your honor,' says Andrew. 'O, never mind that, just send him-he'll soon get over his backwardness, and there will be no fear of his being ridiculed in my school. It is hard, certainly, for a grown lad to find himself learning the rudiments with those that are younger, but that should only stimulate him to learn faster.' 'Then that's true for you, sir,' said Connor; 'and, indeed, James has some little notion of readin' an' writin' already, if I don't mistake, for he was always a smart sort of a boy.' 'Then it would be criminal in you to keep him back; send him as regularly as you can-I'll not be severe on him for missing a day now and then when you really need his help.' 'The saints be good to your honor-'tis yourself's a gentleman all out,' says Connor, and the teacher went on his way overjoyed at his success, little imagining that James was a full grown man, bigger than himself. We could see that he was disappointed in his new pupil when he made his first appearance, but he evidently tries to make the best of his bargain, and a bad bargain it is, as Jim says."</p> 
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7227-00000104"/> 
               <p>"O, but Jim's a cute one," said Pat admiringly.</p> 
               <p>"He's a bad boy, I'm afraid," said Johanna; "and I hope you'll take care not to fall into his ways."</p> 
               <p>"Me! oh, murder-the teacher would kill me outright if I was to serve him as Jim Connor does," said Pat, laughing heartily.</p> 
               <p>"'Tis good that there's something to keep you from bein' led astray by his example," continued the prudent mother. "It ill becomes boys or girls to give impudence to them that's teaching them what may be useful enough some day-if they don't pay too dear for it meanwhile," added she, after a pause, for she never could banish her dread of the sectarian influence of the schools. "Does Jim get Bible tasks as well as the rest?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, such tasks!" laughed Mick. "There's little danger that he will ever be called on to display his scriptural knowledge to visitors. Indeed, it is a shame the way he turns and twists every Bible lesson that is given to him into every meaning but the right one; and when Mr. Turner reproves him, he puts on his innocent look, and, in the drollest brogue he can muster, answers, 'Sure, an' that's all the sense myself can make out of it, sir.' I told him the other day that he ought to be ashamed of such doings."</p> 
               <p>"Well, what did he say to that?" asked Bernard.</p> 
               <p>"He rolled his eyes about in that comical way you may have noticed in his brother Larry, and said, 'Whist, Mick! What a simple spalpeen you are. Musn't I make use of my right of private judgment? Parson Robinson is always saying that <emph>every living creature has that right.</emph> I don't know whether he counts the cows and horses in with the rest, and many a time I tried to ask him, only I'm so bashful, somehow the words stick in my throat.' I told him I thought he was often guilty of irreverence, as Mr. Turner tells him. On which he set up a laugh, and asked me if I didn't think I was talking great nonsense. 'Sure it isn't the real Bible, you know, Mick, but only a book of king James, my holy namesake; an' havn't I as much right to make game of that book as any other?'"</p> 
               <p>"How he must try the master," said Bernard, who had listened with all a boy's interest in such doings; "the only thing I wonder at is that he puts up with it."</p> 
               <p>"What can he do, Bernard? <emph>that's</emph> the question."</p> 
               <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7227-00000105"/> 
               <p>"Oh, if you could only see him," cried Pat, exultingly.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, it's bad enough to hear of him," said Johanna. "I only wonder at such conduct in one of his father's children. Jim always seems to me to be well behaved in church."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and everywhere else where he wants to; but you see, mother, he doesn't want to go to school, and only goes for the sake of mischief. And the only way of stopping him would be to expel him, and that Mr. Turner doesn't want to do. And then he gets around the teacher so cunningly. Sometimes, when he thinks he has gone rather too far, he gets very solemn, and pays the greatest attention to the next lesson; and when the recitation is over, you ought to hear him talking, as if to himself, while he knows all the time that every one around can hear him. 'Oh, then, it's grand to be in a school like this. Won't I get every one of my little nephews and nieces here, according as they get big enough? 'Tis well off they'll be to have the luck of coming when they're small.' Then he heaves the deepest sigh you ever heard, and Mr. Turner looks at him <emph>so</emph> pitifully, believing that the poor fellow is most heart broken because he has not had such luck; and so the rogue is freely forgiven his past misdeeds."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">The Proselytisers Defeated.</head> 
               <p>THE school exercises on New Year's Eve, went off with great eclat. The Lord Bishop and his daughter were present, with a select party of visitors from "the palace;" the Doctor and the agent, with their respective families, together with other notabilities, graced the occasion; all lavish of compliments, protesting that the teachers had been remarkably successful this first year, and predicting that they would be still more so during the coming one.</p> 
               <p>Mick Regan, now appointed "paid monitor," was presented in due form by his teacher to the great people. He received from his lordship the comfortable assurance that "he had done very well indeed;" a few words of praise and a sovereign from some of the visitors; and from the Hon. Miss Woolcut a condescending smile, which, from so proud and beautiful a lady, should<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7227-00000106"/> have been esteemed a guerdon worth toiling for, worth dying for. But Mick, with all the perversity of his race, scorned it as having no warmth or sincerity in it; and as he went back to his place, he recollected many of the triumphs he had obtained in the catechism class, when "Miss Margaret," with her own beaming smile, would say, "Well done, Mick; you'll make me quite proud of my success in teaching;" and thought his present success would seem worth something if she were there to reward him with one of her bright glances.</p> 
               <p>But she had not been invited to the opening; neither had Father Dillon, an omission which sadly perplexed those who had accepted as gospel truth all the curate's assurances of the <emph>liberal and truly Catholic spirit</emph> in which the schools were to be conducted. The omission seemed all the more surprising to those credulous individuals, inasmuch as clergymen of various denominations were present, from neighboring parishes. Several of these gentlemen made addresses, in which the zeal and liberality of the noble patron and patroness, and the ability of the devoted teachers were lauded to the skies; and promises were kindly given by the clerical speakers, that during the ensuing year they would deliver occasional lectures to the scholars on matters connected with their moral and religious instruction. This promise, which was quickly made known to all the inhabitants of Bartrymore, created not a little consternation among those deluded Catholics who had suffered themselves to be cajoled or frightened into sending their children to the Lord Bishop's school, in despite the repeated warnings of their zealous pastor. They could now understand how they had been cunningly entrapped, and they had dismal forebodings of coming ill.</p> 
               <p>Johanna Regan's fears, always on the alert, were redoubled. Poor woman! It seemed as if she were destined never to be free from care and trouble; for this fresh burden of anxiety came just when she had begun to enjoy a little respite from want and sorrow. Bernard's illness had taken one of those favorable turns which mark the progress of consumption, awakening alike in the invalid and anxious friends hopes of final recovery. Mrs. Turner was very attentive to the sick boy; many little comforts had found the way from the parsonage to the poor cabin, and "the wolf," which had growled so threateningly at the door in the beginning of the winter, was no longer dreaded. Barney-"the head of<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7227-00000107"/> the house"-basked in this little gleam of sunshine with all the complacent satisfaction of a lazy man. Small impression did his wife's fears of the prosleytisers make on his mind; and he only began to reason on the matter when she besought him to commence the New Year by taking his children from the school.</p> 
               <p>"Easy, now, Johanna; never hollo till you're hurt. No harm's come to them <emph>yet</emph> through the school, and 'tisn't likely to. Mickey's a sensible boy: he knows his duty too well to be led astray by any bad teaching."</p> 
               <p>"It's not so much afraid for him I am, as for the others, Barney?"</p> 
               <p>"Aye, the others," and Barney took a long puff at his pipe. "Well, Pat 'ill be leaving there in the spring, and Susan would know in a minute if strange doctrines were preached to her, and Alley's no more'n a baby; no fear of <emph>her.</emph> We'll just let things rest as they are for a while anyhow, and get all we can out of them."</p> 
               <p>"But if they <emph>do</emph> try to turn any of them against their religion, Barney, will ye bring them home then?" persisted the mother.</p> 
               <p>"Why wouldn't I? Do ye think I have no care at all for their souls, woman, or have you enough of it for the pair of us?"</p> 
                
               <p>With this equivocal answer Johanna was forced to content herself; but she resolved to redouble her care for the children. The necessity for this vigilance was soon evident.</p> 
               <p>At the close of the school festival on New Year's Eve, Mrs. Turner detained little Alley, telling Mick that she intended to "keep her as long as her mother could spare her, or, at least during the holidays; there would be no school until the following week, and the child would be such pleasant company for her during those few days, especially as her husband was to be absent on business." This arrangement was far from satisfactory to Alley's mother. Mrs. Turner had more than once intimated a desire to have the child to bring up as her own; and on Christmas day, when she had brought some little dainties to the sick youth, she exerted all her powers of persuasion in entreaties that Alley might be allowed to remain with her for the winter. The distance from the cabin to the school-house was too far for so young a child during the bad weather, and it would be a thousand pities to keep her at home until spring; by that time she would forget, what she had already learned, and she was coming on so fast now, bright little thing as she was! But Johanna had been proof<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7227-00000108"/> against entreaties and reproaches; and she now, much to her husband's chagrin, insisted that Mick should go the first thing after breakfast and bring the child home. In vain Barney protested against an act "which would give great offence to the people who only wanted to be kind to the wee creature."</p> 
               <p>"It's no use to be tryin' to blindfold me, Barney. To-morrow is a holiday, as you know; and, please God! the child will go to mass along with her brothers and sister."</p> 
               <p>And, true to her resolve, as soon as Mick had eaten his breakfast, she said to him:</p> 
               <p>"Put on your cap, alanna, and go after your little sister, an' mind you don't leave that house without her. You needn't come all the way home; stop and see Mrs. O'Loughlin-she's always glad to see her godson-an' then go on to the church; we'll overtake you in time for mass."</p> 
               <p>Barney, whose appearance but ill corresponded with the clean, tidy look of his family on this holy day, would not listen without expressing his disapproval of this peremptory order.</p> 
               <p>"Can't you hear to reason, Johanna, and let the child stay where she'll be comfortable the day? Well, have your own way, and much good it 'ill do you. Maybe they'd eat her if she was left to them a day."</p> 
               <p>"She's been up there longer than I want; but there was no help for it."</p> 
               <p>"An' you're sendin' for her in spite of all? Well, well; it's often I've heard that a pig is the stubbornest of all creatures; but, bedad, if a woman don't beat him it's a queer thing!"</p> 
               <p>And with this profound reflection on the stubbornness of his better half, Barney lighted his dudeen, and prepared to enjoy his holiday in his own lazy fashion, smoking and sleeping. But even he was startled that evening, when Alley, having said her prayers as usual at her mother's knee, began to talk of the pretty prayer she had said "<emph>to Mrs. Turner</emph>" the night before; the child could not remember it-it was something about laying down to sleep, and pray the Lord; but it was such a <emph>pretty</emph> prayer, and Mrs. Turner promised to teach it to her, but Alley wanted her mother to say it for her now.</p> 
               <p>"Why didn't Alley say the prayers that mother taught her, like a good child?" asked Johanna.</p> 
               <p>"Alley did say them, but the mistress says 'Hail Mary' and 'Holy Mary' is a bad, ugly prayer, and she says God will be angry with<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7227-00000109"/> Alley if she ever says them again." And the little thing raised her large innocent eyes to her mother, with all a child's perplexity, how to reconcile the contradictory teachings of the mother she loved so dearly, and the schoolmistress who was so kind to her.</p> 
               <p>Johanna Regan, by a strong effort, kept back the bitter words that struggled for utterance: while compelled to send her children to the school, she would not teach any of them to "disrespect" the master or mistress. But when she returned to the kitchen, she made another attempt to convince her husband that the children's faith was endangered by their attendance at the proselytising schools. In vain. He owned to feeling vexation at Mrs. Turner's unwarrantable interference; but then, there was some back rent due, and it would be very inconvenient to displease his lordship just now; and, besides, Mick would be getting some wages along with his learning in the school-the temptation was too great to be resisted.</p> 
               <p>"And there'll be no more harm done," he added, having put the subject before her in as favorable a light as he could; "as you say you won't let the child go to the school any more-for the winter, at least."</p> 
                
               <p>"That I won't, nor in the spring, either," replied the mother, energetically. "And mind, children," turning to the three who had been attentive listeners to the discussion, "let none of you ever stay with them people a minute after school is out. Mind what I'm saying now-I want the three of you to come home together when the lessons are done, let the parson or the teachers coax you as they will. If ever one of you stays behind, it 'ill only be giving your mother a long walk there after you."</p> 
               <p>"Never fear, mother," said Mick; "I know them now." And the few words, uttered with such quiet firmness, assured the anxious parent that she need have no further apprehensions on that score.</p> 
               <p>"Mother," said Bernard, suddenly, "I've been thinking how the hand of God is in all you do. See how it would be with little Alley, if Mrs. Turner had got her from you for the winter. Didn't I often wonder that you could hold out against all her pleading? and I thought more than once that it looked hard and ungrateful to refuse her what she seemed to have her heart set on."</p> 
               <p>"So did I, agra; but somehow, for all her smooth talking, I always mistrusted her; and<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7227-00000110"/> the saints be praised that I held out against all her coaxin'. 'Twould be little of her prayers, or anything good, poor Alley would have at the end of the winter. Well, she's safe from them, thank God! and that's one comfort we have this New Year's night. And Bernard's doin' better, and that's another blessing. You're feeling better, ain't you, Bernard, dear?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, mother, a great deal better," said the youth, cheerfully, looking up with a smile to the eyes bent as anxiously upon him. That smile, that cheerful tone, brought sunshine to the heart of the fond mother.</p> 
               <p>"God be praised!" was her joyful ejaculation. "And may he give the grace of conversion to them that's been good to you; with His help, you'll be as well as ever, when the fine spring weather comes to us, Bernard."</p> 
               <p>Alas for hopes destined never to be realized! The fine spring weather came, but brought no gift of healing to the consumptive boy; and the sunshine of a bright May day streamed from the unclouded skies, as if in mockery of the poor mother's woe, as she followed the pulseless form of her first-born to its resting place. It was on Sunday afternoon, and the church was thronged when the corpse was reverently borne in and laid before the holy altar, for that touching burial service with which the Church of God solemnly yields up her departed child to Him who has but reclaimed the spirit He lent for a time to earth.</p> 
               <p>Father Dillon was much affected in reading the prayers, and, with tenderness and pathos that touched every heart, he spoke of the youth whose place was no longer with men, but with angels. He dwelt on the piety, the fervent, unobtrusive virtue that had marked the course of that brief life; the toil, the suffering and privation, which, meekly borne, had won for him an eternal crown of glory; and, while holding up the bright example of the deceased to the younger members of his flock, he failed not to impress on the minds of parents the necessity of taking care of those precious souls that God had committed to them; he dwelt on the dangers, to which some thoughtlessly exposed them, of becoming indifferent to the religion which should be a thousand times dearer to them than life, and exhorted them to vigilant, unceasing care, lest those young hearts should lose the bright gift of faith bestowed on them by baptism, and become aliens and strangers to the creed which their forefathers had adhered to through ages of persecution.</p> 
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7227-00000111"/> 
               <p>The coffin was lowered into the grave, the last prayers said, and the men had taken their shovels to perform the last sad duty over the dead, when the bereaved father put forth his hand to stay them. With choking utterance, but with a fervor unusual to him, he said:</p> 
               <p>"My poor boy had but one trouble in leaving this world: it was the thought of his little brothers and sisters. I promised him before Father Dillon, and here, standin' over his grave, I take you all to witness, that from this day no child of mine shall ever enter a Protestant school."</p> 
               <p>"O, God bless you for that word, Barney," sobbed the faithful mother, "you've taken half the load of woe from my heart."</p> 
               <p>"Heaven grant you strength to keep your promise," spoke the sweet, solemn voice of his Pastor, and a fervent "Amen!" was uttered by all around.</p> 
               <p>When the mournful ceremony was concluded, and the crowd slowly dispersing, one after another came up to shake hands with Regan in mingled sympathy and congratulation. Some spurred on by his example, and deeply impressed by the exhortation they had heard in the church, announced their intention of immediately removing their children from the insidious influence against which the zealous priest had never failed to warn them. Others, among whom were the O'Loughlins, who had already withdrawn their little ones from the snares of the proselytisers, stood forth to encourage their neighbors in adopting a similar course. That day the baneful spell of Lord Woolcut's influence over the peasantry of Bartrymore was broken forever-the work his artful co-operators had been so industriously pursuing was at an end; the younglings of the fold were henceforward secure from their machinations.</p> 
               <p>Consternation overwhelmed minister and teacher; the rage of the Lord Bishop was unbounded. Were his known wishes to be thus set at defiance, his cunningly laid plans to be overthrown by these miserable, priest-ridden creatures? Immediately, printed papers, informing them of his "earnest desire" that their children should attend his schools, were circulated among them; and his refractory tenants were warned of the consequences that would infallibly ensue if they continued disobedient. This proving ineffectual, "notice to quit" was served on those heads of families who had excited the ire of the proselytising landlord. But all failed to reduce them to submission. Encouraging<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7227-00000112"/> couraging each other to constancy, kept in the right path by the faithful and devoted pastor whom they regarded with almost idolatrous affection, sustained and strengthened by the holy "Spirit of Fortitude," whom they were taught daily to invoke, the tenants of Lord Woolcut were proof against threat or bribe. The zealous parson found his occupation gone. The teachers looked mournfully around on the half empty benches, and despaired, as well they might, of ever seeing them filled. While, to add to their vexations, Father Dillon's schools were in the most flourishing condition. Most of the pupils lately withdrawn from "the Bishop's schools," now attended them, and there was plainly need for larger buildings and additional teachers. What a triumph for the self-sacrificing priest! what an exemplification of the spirit which animates that Faith which alone can work such wonders in the midst of opposition, contumely, and oppression, ever quietly extending her empire, and attaching her children to her with the imperishable bonds of love!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">The Evictions.</head> 
               <p>IT was the afternoon of a cold, raw day, late in November. All day heavy clouds had hung over the sky, with an occasional gleam of sunshine, which only made the succeeding gloom more dreary. Now the wind swept fiercely down from the bleak mountains, the scattered clouds were gathered into dense masses, that betokened a coming tempest. From the wild hills that surrounded Bartrymore, a strange scene might have been witnessed; strange, that is, in any other land than Erin; but, alas, what phase of misery, of brutal oppression, is unfamiliar to that ill-fated country! Around a barrack-one of the five which the Lord Bishop had thought necessary for the enforcement of his legal rights-several groups of constabulary were assembling, in evident expectation of work to be done. Presently another<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7227-00000113"/> party came upon the scene; the sheriff, a subagent of Lord Woolcut, and several bailiffs. Some minutes are devoted to drilling the forces in the barrack yard, then all turn out, and in due order take their places after the officer who represents the majesty and <emph>justice</emph> of British rule in Ireland. With measured tread they march on, those heroes, armed, not with sword or musket, but with that unique weapon which has accomplished so much glorious work in Ireland during the last fifteen years, as to have well earned the distinction of giving name to a new class of "British soldiers"-the Crowbar Brigade. On they come in dauntless array, with a military force, to serve as a covering party, bringing up the rear.</p> 
               <p>Leaving the high road, they took their way among the hills skirting the village, and drew up in imposing force before the first house they came to-the home of the Regans. A loud rap brought Johanna to the door.</p> 
               <p>"Where is your husband, my good woman?" asked the sheriff.</p> 
               <p>"He's away at work, sir. He got a job, himself and Mick-that's our oldest child, your honor-over beyond there," pointing across the hills.</p> 
                
               <p>The sheriff was silent for a moment. Sworn officer of the law though he was, he yet was not so destitute of manly feeling as to show no reluctance in telling the poor woman that her landlord required her to leave the premises forthwith, in accordance with the notice her husband had previously received.</p> 
               <p>Johanna heard the cruel mandate in silence. She had long looked forward with dread to this moment. Hard was the sacrifice, but it was the penalty of her fidelity to God-she was ready to pay it. While the men were putting her few bits of furniture out of doors she wrapped up little Alley as comfortably as her limited wardrobe would allow, then threw her blue cloak over her shoulders, and taking the child by the hand, gave one last look around the place she had so long called home; one look, the tears starting, to the room where Bernard died, and murmuring, "God be with you, poor old place!" crossed the threshold her feet were never to tread again. Out in the wintry wind, with the wondering, frightened child clinging to her hand, she stood, looking through blinding tears at the bustling bailiff, as he extinguished the fire she had just built up afresh, "to be snug and warm again' the others come home;" saw him secure<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7227-00000114"/> the door, and "fall in" to his place among the instruments of a bishop's cruelty. One of the men, touched by her uncomplaining submission, turned back to speak a word of consolation.</p> 
               <p>"Better not stop here," he added; "see, the rain is beginning to fall; it will be a wild night; of course, you know somebody that will take you in?"</p> 
               <p>She did not answer him, nor moved until "the peelers" had filed by; then tidying the things and securing them as well as she could from the drizzling rain, she sat down on the heap of bedding, and drawing Alley beneath the shelter of her cloak, patiently awaited the coming of the remainder of the evicted household. Susan and Patrick were the first to arrive; and, ere they could be made to comprehend the scene (for, as the boy kept telling his mother, the rent was paid, every shilling of it, and how, then, could they be turned out?) the father and Mick made their appearance. At sight of her husband, the poor woman's forced composure gave way. Rushing to his arms, she sobbed out the sad story, to the amazed and heart-stricken man. But there was little time to grieve over the misfortune that had come upon them so suddenly. Night was fast approaching; it was needful to think what had best be done. Regan, dilatory, and fond of taking things easy, was of no use in this emergency.</p> 
               <p>"We can do nothing to-night, Johanna," was his answer to his wife's representations. "It's too late to go looking for shelter, an' where would we go? Is it to them that's not got enough for themselves? and may be to bring the lord's anger down on them for taking part with us? We'll just stay where we are till morning's dawn, an' then we'll find some place to put our little things an' ourselves, never fear."</p> 
               <p>"An' are these children to be in the wet an' cold all night, Barney? Is that the best thing you can think of for them?"</p> 
               <p>"Easy, now; we can make them comfortable here between us, and-"</p> 
               <p>"No, I'll not have them stop here to get their death of cold such a night as this," interrupted the mother, in her decisive way. "Go as fast as you can to Mrs. O'Loughlin, children; an' Mick, you'll tell her what's happened, and she'll give you all shelter for the night. No one was ever turned from Michael O'Loughlin's door in distress, let alone children that's got no home."</p> 
               <p>"And where will you go, mother?" questioned Mick.</p> 
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7227-00000115"/> 
               <p>"Never mind me, child; I'll do very well. It's little your father and I would sleep to-night, wherever we'd be. Run along now, the four of you, an' lose no time. The rain's coming down harder every minute. God help us, and every body that's in want of it this night," she ejeculated fervently, as having seen the objects of her solicitude off, she sat down with her husband near a ditch that partly sheltered them from the wind, blowing more fiercely now, in keen, cutting blasts, as the stormy night closed in. It was almost dark when Mick returned.</p> 
               <p>"In the world what brought you back, alanna?" asked the mother, regretfully. "Didn't you know that I wanted you all to be together?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't ask me to leave you, mother. I'll stay with you," replied the boy, in his quiet, earnest way. "See! Godmother thought you'd be hungry, or that father would, any way; so she sent you this."</p> 
               <p>"The saints be good to her, and all belonging to her! 'tis herself that always has the kind thought for every one," said Johanna, as, to please the youth, she pretended to partake of the food for which she had no relish.</p> 
               <p>Barney, cold, wet, tired and hungry, after his day's work, ate heartily and in silence. He was pondering over the course of his troubles, and the poor fellow, "well-meaning, harmless man," as his neighbors would have described him, had none of that resolute purpose, that inflexible attachment to principle, which supported his wife under the present trial. Not for a moment did she think of regaining her home by a timely submission to the great man whose vengeance was so terrible; while poor Regan, on the contrary, was considering the feasibility of going "the very first thing in the morning to the parson, and humbly begging him to intercede for him with the Lord Bishop, that he might get back his little place. He believed he could easily get it back on the one condition; but-well, well, God help the poor! He knows how it is with them in this cruel world, and sure He won't be hard on them! But then that promise-there was sin in breaking it, not to mind the disgrace before the priest and the congregation; but, then, to think of the children; <emph>maybe</emph> they'd be none the worse for going to the school another while; but what would become of them without any shelter?"</p> 
               <p>In this strain ran Barney's soliloquy, and he gave no heed to his wife and son, who were beguiling the time talking. Mick had much to tell<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7227-00000116"/> of his brief visit to Mrs. O'Loughlin, her surprise and grief at the news he brought, and how strange she thought it that they had not all come together to her house; she was sure neither she nor her husband could rest, knowing that Mick's father and mother were out in the cold and rain. And Mick went on to tell how he had heard that the sheriff had only called at one house beside theirs, and, as one of the family was "down with the fever and ague, and the shaking fit was just coming on," he had consented to leave them undisturbed for the night; he had some similar business to attend to on the morrow, so he could leave their case till the last. Johanna sighed a kindly sympathy with her fellow sufferers.</p> 
               <p>"So there's more misfortunate ones to be turned out of doors! Very like all them that were noticed; but whist! what sound is that?"</p> 
               <p>It was a horse and cart coming slowly along, and directly a cheery voice sung out, "Ho, Barney Regan! Johanna! where are you?"</p> 
               <p>"'Tis godfather," cried Mick joyfully, leading his mother in the direction of the sound, for the night was now intensely dark. While Regan sprang up with unusual agility crying plaintively. "Its here we are, Mr. O'Loughlin-the saints look down on us-alongside of the ditch."</p> 
                
               <p>"You ought to be thrown over it," was the complimentary rejoinder. "Johanna, where was your sense-since your husband had none-that you did not go straight to a house where you might know you'd be welcome?"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, sir, myself thought I was making free enough, crowding the young ones in on you without as much as asking leave."</p> 
               <p>"That <emph>was</emph> an oversight. You should have sent a messenger in advance to ask if it would be convenient to receive them. Mick do you find anything else about there?"</p> 
               <p>"No sir, I believe all the things are in the cart."</p> 
               <p>O'Loughlin swung his lantern round to take a last survey of the spot, then helped Johanna into the cart, and they set off as rapidly as the darkness and the state of the road would allow. How bright looked the comfortable kitchen of the farm house to the homeless pair, and how thankfully beat the mother's heart as she saw her little ones playing merrily with the O'Loughlins, who were "making much" of their unexpected guests. And Barney enjoyed the happy change in his position, though he must give up the plans with which he had solaced himself alongside of the ditch. No one knew of them,<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7227-00000117"/> that was one comfort. Supper was soon served, and the little party, despite all, was a cheerful one.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it may be my turn next," said the host, in response to a chance remark of Barney's. "However, to-morrow has not come yet, and as we don't know what it may have in store for us, we'll just make the most of to-night, and let the morrow take care of itself."</p> 
               <p>The next morning dawned drearily over Bartrymore. The cold drizzling rain still fell mingled with sleet; but dreary as was the face of nature how much deeper the gloom in those dwellings which owned Lord Woolcut as landlard. The news of yesterday's work had spread quickly among the people, and brought most agonizing apprehensions to those amongst his tenants who, having like the Apostle preferred to obey God rather than man, must now prepare to undergo man's vengeance. Work was suspended. Each little family group huddled in trembling suspense around the hearth from which perchance they would soon be cast out forever.</p> 
               <p>The morning was far advanced when the sheriff and his men again made their appearance. Arriving before one of the devoted houses the sheriff and the agent drew up their gallant steeds, while the military ranged themselves at a proper distance behind the officials, keeping off the crowd of excited spectators, who waited in death-like stillness the commencement of the barbarous work. Two of the bailiffs advanced simultaneously, rapped loudly once, twice, thrice, no answer; deep silence reigned over the place. A bailiff seized the door handle and shook it fiercely, as if to wrest the door from its fastenings, but the tenement was strong and in good repair, the door held out against the rude onset. Amid the groans and lamentations of the multitude the crowbar was brought into requisition, and entrance forcibly obtained. There, gathered around the fire in speechless consternation, were father, mother, and children-ten human beings-looking despairingly at the invaders, by whom they were to be flung out like worthless weeds on the roadside.</p> 
               <p>"Come, hustle out, good folks, we're in a hurry," said one of the bailiffs, beginning at the same time to remove the furniture.</p> 
               <p>The unfortunate tenant instinctively clenched his fist, and started forward, but a glance at the imposing force without, the red-coated and black-coated soldiers of the Queen, showed the folly of resistance. With a smothered groan, he addressed the sheriff:</p> 
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7227-00000118"/> 
               <p>"This is very hard, sir; I don't owe Lord Woolcut a farthing. All the neighbors can tell you I'm a hard-working, honest man, that has never wronged any living creature."</p> 
               <p>A murmur of assent rose from the crowd. The sheriff, who was listening with an air of studied indifference, cast a warning glance around. The man went on, useless as he knew appeal to be:</p> 
               <p>"How can I be expected to stand here and see my wife-and she's far from strong, sir-and these helpless babies cast out on the road? If I'd committed a crime, sir, you know it wouldn't be just to punish them."</p> 
               <p>"Here, suppose you take yourself out of the way," cried one of the bailiffs, roughly seizing a little girl as he spoke, and thrusting her towards the doorway. A blow from the enraged father made him stagger back. In an instant half a dozen of his comrades were ready to level the offender to the ground; but a word from the sheriff caused them to fall back in sullen quietness.</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry for you," said that functionary compassionately, addressing the victim of oppression, who, nerved to desperation, still maintained his belligerant attitude, regardless of the overwhelming odds against him. "It is a hard case, I admit. Still you know that your landlord has a right to claim his property."</p> 
               <p>"A right to throw those children out to die," interrupted the father fiercely. "Is that the right of a preacher of the gospel-of a Lord Bishop?" he added mockingly.</p> 
               <p>A groan from some of the spectators, and cries of-"Yes, he'll preach his gospel next Sabbath." "He's got a new gospel, belike, that tells him to oppress the poor."</p> 
               <p>"Silence, there!" cried the now angry official. "Men, finish your work."</p> 
               <p>"It is finished, your worship," said one of the obsequious heroes of the crowbar. "The things is all cleaned out, your honor."</p> 
               <p>Yes, the work was done. Chairs, chests, and tables, beds, clothing, and cooking utensils, were all huddled confusedly together; nothing remained but to oust the family, and fasten the door. A loud wail of grief rose from the multitude as the man led his wife forth, weeping, and clasping to her breast a young babe; weak and trembling she crouched down on a stool in the midst of her little possessions, homeless and heart-broken. Some of the crowd lingered to condole with her: the rest followed the officers of the law on to the next house. Little force<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7227-00000119"/> was needed here; a shake or two sent the door inwards. Two children and a grown girl rushed out at the same moment, crying and wailing; a man followed them, the picture of abject terror and misery. The officers made short work: skillets and crocks, and bowls and trenchers, were gathered up hastily, the few pieces of furniture tossed out, the smoking bits of turf extinguished, a handful of thatch pulled down from the roof, a twig stuck in the door, and the scene closed: the valuable tenement was at Lord Woolcut's disposal. What matter if the feeble, unresisting tenant, whose life-blood had been coined into shillings to pay an exorbitant rent for the miserable hovel, was now, in his declining years, a homeless wanderer, looking on, with his motherless children, in despairing wretchedness, as the rain and sleet deluged their few household goods, their all of earthly possessions? Angels might have shed a tear of compassion over that weeping group; but what cared the Lord Bishop, in his sumptuous palace, for the miserable creatures!</p> 
               <p>On to the next of the doomed houses. "Barricaded!" cried one of the bailiffs, with a coarse laugh, as, after vainly rapping for admission, he tried the door, and a grim smile broke over the stern set features of the agent at the folly of the poor wretches, who thought thus to resist the dread power of the law. A huge stone, dexterously wielded, soon gained the man entrance. At the same moment a shrill, heart-rending cry, echoed by childish voices, was heard, and a distracted looking woman rushed out, and, falling on her knees before the sheriff, with clasped hands and streaming tears, besought his pity for her fatherless children.</p> 
               <p>"I've worked hard to keep the shelter over them, your worship," she cried, in accents of heart-broken sorrow. "I've strove hard to be both father and mother to them, since it pleased God to take their poor father to himself, four years ago come Christmas-day."</p> 
               <p>"That you have, poor soul!" exclaimed sympathising voices from the crowd. "You've had your own struggle, asthore."</p> 
               <p>The sheriff lowered his umbrella, partly to hide his emotion, partly to signify that entreaties were useless. But the widow had seen the expression of his countenance, and she caught at the glimmer of hope it inspired.</p> 
               <p>"God bless your honor, ever an' always!" she sobbed fervently. "Sure I knew you couldn't do it-it isn't in the heart of you to deny the<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7227-00000120"/> prayer of the friendless poor; you'll leave the shelter to my little creatures-the heavens be your bed!"</p> 
               <p>"I can't, indeed, my good woman. I would if it rested with me; but you know you had notice to quit long ago."</p> 
               <p>"I had, your worship-it's truth your saying-but where'ud I go? And did I think the rich lord would throw us out in the beginning of the cold weather! Wait till the heart of the winter is broke, your honor. Children, where are you? go down on your knees to the good gentleman, an' put your little innocent hands together-he's got children of his own, maybe; may he be long spared to them, an' may they grow up a comfort to him."</p> 
               <p>The sheriff, angry at showing feelings that did him honor, dashed the starting tears away, and turned an inquiring glance upon the agent, as one who could at least postpone the execution of the cruel order. But that personage was calm and unmoved as ever: his eyes wandering over the sorrowful scene as if it was a dramatic spectacle got up for his amusement. With a muttered curse on his heartlessness, the sheriff backed his horse away from the kneeling group.</p> 
               <p>"I can do nothing for you," he said, harshly; "it's Lord Woolcut's affair, not mine."</p> 
                
               <p>"Sobbing and moaning, the poor widow rose from her suppliant posture. Turning instinctively to re-enter her cabin, she found that advantage had been taken of the time wasted in fruitless importunities: her little possessions had been thrust out of doors, and the men were now securing the premises against her intrusion, glad that they had been able to do the work so easily. At the cruel sight, her cries broke forth with frantic violence.</p> 
               <p>"Confound it!" said the sheriff, as he galloped away. "A man had need to have a heart of stone to witness such scenes as these!"</p> 
               <p>The agent gave an almost imperceptible sneer.</p> 
               <p>"Nay, my dear sir," he said blandly, "you suffer your feelings to become interested-the very thing those people aim at effecting. They will treat those who have the reputation of being what they call soft-hearted, to such exhibitions at a moment's notice. For my part, so well do I understand them, that they make no more impression on me than if they were so many pupets, acting by invisible but cunningly devised springs."</p> 
               <p>"You are fortunate, sir," was the curt reply, "to have your feelings under such control-if you have any," was added in an aside.</p> 
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7227-00000121"/> 
               <p>They pursued their ride in silence, but the sheriff took care when next they drew rein to have his companion between him and the doomed tenement. It was hard enough for the humane man to have to witness such scenes of misery, without the additional pain of refusing prayers which he felt should be granted. For these were none of the every-day evictions for arrears of rent, or similar weighty reasons in the eyes of the law. These were evictions for conscience sake, as he well knew; and while he wondered equally at the bigotry which prompted such persecution, and the firmness which bore it sooner than yield, he could not help both compassionating and admiring the victims of the Right Reverened oppressor; and in pity to them as well as to himself he allowed no further opportunity for petitions, but hurried on his men to their work.</p> 
               <p>"Half-past two," said he looking at his watch, as he turned from another triumph of the peelers, "and three of these delectable affairs yet remain, I move they be postponed until to-morrow. We have seen and inflicted misery enough for one day."</p> 
               <p>The agent demurred. By taking another road in returning to the barrack they could evict a family, which he had particular reasons for clearing off of the estate; an insolent, seditious set."</p> 
               <p>"But it will be night shortly, and how are the poor wretches to provide themselves with shelter in the midst of this driving storm, too? It is barbarous."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, they'll find some place; no fear of them." was the careless reply. "And as for movables they are not much troubled with them; a few minutes will suffice for their moving."</p> 
               <p>Without further parley the leaders galloped off, at a pace that gave the men on foot no little trouble to keep up with them, and in a few moments drew rein before the doomed cabin. It was the one from which the parson had once found it convenient to take refuge in flight; and the victor of that day, the stout-hearted, plain-spoken Judy Welsh, now confronted the peelers with uplifted poker, ready to do duty on the first luckless cranium that came in its way.</p> 
               <p>"Keep off, every one of you," she cried, brandishing her weapon, from which the heroes of the crowbar instinctively retreated. "I give you all fair warning-the first man that steps across the threshold I'll level to the floor."</p> 
               <p>"This is child's play, good woman," said the sheriff, to whom the men looked inquiringly.</p> 
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7227-00000122"/> 
               <p>"May be so," was the cool reply. "Let them that think so come forward and have a trial of it."</p> 
               <p>"There's your husband, Judy; you'll make him ashamed of you," said one of the men.</p> 
               <p>Before she could reply a man left the crowd and stepped to the door. At the same instant the agent shouted, "Pull down the shanty, boys; down with it; 'tis worth nothing-only fit for pigs!"</p> 
               <p>"Is that the reason your master gets a big rent for it?" screamed the incensed Judy. "Do you hear that, Andy? After your slaving-"</p> 
               <p>"Be quiet, woman; what's to be gained by provoking them? It's true, sir," and he turned to the sheriff, "the place is but a poor one, but such as it is we've been glad to put up with it, since the famine time threw us behindhand. And poor as it is, the rent was raised twice upon me, and once when I wasn't able to pay it, through the sickness, everything we had was sold to pay for it. We've had many a thing to put us back, your honor; sickness, and bad times, and, not long ago, the old grandmother's death and burying, heaven rest her soul! And now that we were just getting along, and gathering a few things around us again-"</p> 
                
               <p>"'Tis a hard case, I admit," interrupted the sheriff. "I have no doubt you'll find a better place than this, Andrew; you couldn't well find a worse one."</p> 
               <p>"No, sir; but to be turned out this way, after paying a high rent for years! And there's an old couple, too feeble to be moved such a day as this, your honor, even if there was a place ready to take them to."</p> 
               <p>"That will do; stand aside, and let the men do their work," was the brutal rejoinder of the agent; and Andrew, giving him a look of mingled scorn and dread, disappeared into the cabin. The next instant he came forward with his wife, tenderly supporting between them an aged couple, Judy's parents, whose extreme feebleness was apparent to all. The old man-four-score years had passed over his head-was evidently making an effort to preserve composure; his wife, nearly as old, and far more worn and helpless, presented a moving spectacle, as, with the slow, pitiful-looking tears of old age trickling one by one down her furrowed cheeks, she clasped her withered hands feebly together, and turned her dim eyes on the crowd with a wistful, appealing gaze, that brought sobs of compassion from many a stout heart. Poor, way-worn Pilgrims<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7227-00000123"/> grims! denied the privilege of spending their few remaining days in the place which, wretched as it was, they had long regarded as home. A score of sturdy fellows sprang forward to sustain the tottering forms, and shelter them from the driving sleet and rain. The venerable old man accepted their proffered kindness with gentle dignity; but the fragile partner of his sorrows was inconsolable.</p> 
               <p>"Look at me!" she cried, with touching pathos, "that has passed three-score and fourteen years in this world of woe, and that never harmed a creature, but often gave the bit to the hungry, as well as shelter to the houseless poor. Oh, what have I done to merit such treatment?"</p> 
               <p>Cries and groans from all around echoed the sorrowful lament. But the aged husband spoke, in clear and sweet, though faltering accents:</p> 
               <p>"Peace, agra! the passion and death of our blessed Saviour were more than this!"</p> 
               <p>Oh, wonderful triumph of faith! glorious example of rarest virtue! Words worthy to be quoted as "sublime" by one of the greatest French bishops of our time; how they went to every heart in that multitude, calming angry excitement, and awakening better feelings. But to one there they carried joy and consolation- the holy priest, who would willingly have given his life for his persecuted flock, but who, powerless to protect them against the oppressor, could only witness, in silent anguish of spirit, those pitiable scenes, and endeavor to make some provision for the immediate wants of the hapless victims. Yes, to his sorrowful heart, the heroic resignation evinced by his venerable parishioner, brought joy unspeakable. And how cheering it was to him to behold the ready kindness, the self-denying alacrity of those who, in some cases, had little enough for themselves, yet were only anxious to share that little with their unfortunate neighbors. It was truly an exercise of hospitality under difficulties; but when did Irish hospitality ever wait to calculate "hindrances or contingencies!" By nightfall all were under shelter, a poor and doubtful one, indeed, in some cases, for Lord Wool cut was averse to getting repairs done on his property, caring little whether the houses of his tenants were comfortable or not, if his agent could collect the rent in due season, and his curate prosper in the great work of conversion. Still, however poor the shelter, it was a blessed boon to those who, but for the exertions of their zealous pastor and charitable neighbors, would have had to endure the fierce<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7227-00000124"/> fury of the storm among those bleak and rugged hills.</p> 
               <p>Foremost in offering all the aid that kind hearts and active hands could give, were the O'Loughlins, old and young; though the parents could not banish a haunting fear that their own condition might soon be the same, for the legal notice was hanging over them also. Their fears were verified early the next morning, when the heroes of the crowbar again took up the line of march through the streets of Bartrymore.</p> 
               <p>With manly composure, though his heart was torn with conflicting emotions, the father led his wife and children, together with the "harborless" ones he had harbored, out of doors, and looked on in silence while all his household goods were being removed from the dwelling, dearer to him than any other spot on the wide earth could ever be. Ah, truly it needed the remembrance of the blessing pronounced on those who suffer persecution for justice' sake, to enable those fond parents to endure, with uncomplaining resignation, the doom which would send themselves, and the little band they were rearing in comfort and respectability, adrift on the world.</p> 
               <p>It was over. The house was cleared; the bailiff was fastening the door. At that instant the sheriff rode up to the agent, and spoke to him a few words, receiving an affirmative nod in reply. Then turning to the distressed family, the worthy officer, with a smile that showed how pleasant was this part of his duty, told O'Loughlin that he was at liberty to put his furniture back again, for Lord Woolcut had pardoned him, and he was accordingly to be left in possession of his old home.</p> 
               <p>For an instant the astonishment of his hearers transcended all other feelings. They could scarcely credit what they had heard, even when the bailiff, by the sheriff's order, unfastened the door, and flung it wide open, and the imposing force of soldiers and police filed off down the road. In silent stupefaction the little groups gazed after them till a cry of joy from Johanna Regan broke the spell:</p> 
               <p>"The Lord in Heaven be praised for all His mercies," she exclaimed fervently. "He would not let them, who, for His name's sake, are good to the poor, come to want."</p> 
               <p>With an impulse of pious gratitude, O'Loughlin fell on his knees in the midst of his now happy household, and returned thanks for this unexpected good fortune. Things were soon restored to their former order, and joy and satisfaction<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7227-00000125"/> beamed on every countenance. To O'Loughlin the landlord's clemency seemed little short of miraculous. He was really grateful for it, though his lip would curl whenever he thought of the pardon so graciously extended for the monstrous offence of selecting a school for his children in accordance with his own desires rather than the noble lord's.</p> 
               <p>More zealously than over did this worthy family now continue their efforts to relieve their less fortunate neighbors. And there was but too much need of all that the charitable could do during that long and trying winter. More than three-score of human beings were entirely dependant on others for shelter, and mainly for food, since the provision they had made for the winter was inadequate to their wants.</p> 
               <p>One man contrived a poor substitute for his cabin by fixing some sticks against a wall, and throwing over them straw and bits of turf-a miserable shelter for a wife, and four young, sickly children. Here, in cold and darkness, they spent the Christmas holidays, the glad season bringing no pleasure or festivity to them: yet even for this poor place of refuge they were meekly thankful. The "New Year" brought one of those terrific storms of snow and wind and sleet common to that wild mountain region: the frail hut was overthrown, and the inmates merely escaped with their lives, doomed once more to seek shelter from the charitable neighbors.</p> 
               <p>A few days after the priest was called upon to administer the last consolations of the Church to Judy Welsh's parents, the venerable couple whose great age and feebleness had not saved them from sharing the fate to which a <emph>Christian Bishop</emph> had pitilessly doomed his industrious and inoffensive tenants. Cold, suffering, and anxiety had done their work on the aged pilgrims, and, in the home kindness provided for them, they were now calmly awaiting their summons from a world which had had few charms for them. In their case death was indeed a welcome angel, bearing them to a <emph>home</emph> which they would enjoy forever more. Well might their fellow victims envy, while they mourned, "the happy dead." To them, alas! months and years of privation and hardship remained, with no prospect of happier times to cheer them in their misery. But the power of the holy faith for which they suffered, upheld them through all. How touching was the brief description given by the good priest of one of those faithful "confessors," and<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7227-00000126"/> the same might have been said of all: "The widow Lally has been with me, bearing in her eyes and voice the signs of all she has endured; quite hoarse and choked-up with cold caught during the late snow; her eyes livid and sunken; but, blessed be God, <emph>not a word of complaint from her lips!</emph>"</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">Another Stroke of Vengeance.</head> 
               <p>IT is pleasant to turn from the contemplation of such scenes of distress to a happy household like that of the O'Loughlin's, which, relieved of the dark shadow of a threatened eviction, was now more than ever the abode of contentment and peace. The opening spring found all things in readiness for an early commencement of the farm-work, which was to be unusually heavy this year, stimulated, not by a spirit of covetousness, but by the noble promptings of an ever-active charity. Every thing about the place had that thriving aspect which speaks of cheerful, well-ordered industry; and Father Dillon, as he stood a moment at the gate, casting an observant glance around, thanked God, as he had often done before, that this family, at least, had escaped the relentless persecution from which so many others were suffering.</p> 
               <p>The good priest was received with the welcome<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7227-00000127"/> come which always awaited him there, and Mrs. O'Loughlin's pleasure in seeing him was enhanced by the object of his visit. On the land of one of the small farmers in the neighborhood, were the ruins of an old stone wall, encumbering much of the ground for which the tenant was paying an exorbitant rent to the Hon. Miss Woolcut, the owner of the place. Father Dillon, being about to build a new school-house near his church, had purchased these stones of the man, who was glad to have so much of the "rubbish" taken out of his way, and he had come to ask O'Loughlin to have the stones carted to the site of the proposed building.</p> 
               <p>In the absence of his father, Mark joyfully offered to perform this service for his parish priest. His brother, Frank, was not to be deprived of a share in the good work, so, gaily springing into the cart, the two young fellows rattled away; and, working with a will, soon had the building materials deposited on the designated spot, which presented a scene of busy industry. All the parish felt an interest in the new school-house. Very different would it be from the poor thatched cabins in which the children were now instructed-a large, comfortable edifice, with plenty of windows, and a slated roof, quite a rival, in its humble way, of "my Lord Bishop's" splendid educational edifice. So every one was ready to contribute a mite in money or labor to the great work, which would be of such vast importance to the children, and another proof of that indomitable zeal for religion which no adverse circumstances could destroy. And, <emph>perhaps,</emph> along with all these good motives, the thought which frequently found utterance, "What will Lord Woolcut think when he hears of what we are doing?" contributed a <emph>little</emph> to the general satisfaction. As a learned professor used to observe to his pupils-"In your progress through this world, gentleman, you will find that human nature is, after all, human nature." The good folks of Bartry more, humble, fervent Christians as they were, were yet human; and if in "the high place of the Episcopal Palace," the most cruel and repulsive attributes of human nature could find enterance, how should the poor cabin of the victim be exempt from its foibles?</p> 
               <p>The spring had opened unsually early this year, and the continued fine weather cheered the farmers with the hope of abundant returns for their labor. Michael O'Loughlin was foremost among those who had taken quick advantage of the favorable season. By the middle of April<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7227-00000128"/> his farm gave pleasing evidence of thrifty cultivation. Every spot had been manured, ploughed and harrowed in the most thorough manner; all the various seeds were in the ground; already, under the genial influence of sunshine and shower, the rich and carefully prepared soil was covered with vegetation, that promised well for the time of harvest.</p> 
               <p>"Now everything is in a fair way," said the farmer, as, feeling unusually wearied, he indulged himself with a resting spell on a warm afternoon toward the close of April. "Please God to favor us with good weather our few acres will yield abundantly this year."</p> 
               <p>"That will be good," returned the wife, who always entered heartily into his views. "What a comfort it would have been, this past winter, if we had been able to spare more to the poor people who were in sore need. When I think how near we were to sharing their fate, I feel that we can never do enough for them to show our gratitude to our Heavenly Father for our escape."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, that was a mercy to be remembered to the last day of our lives. How would it have been with these little ones if they had lost their home?"</p> 
                
               <p>And, with a swelling heart, the father looked upon the healthy, blooming children in whom his hopes rested. The youngest had climbed upon his knee, and was now calling attention to the wonderful progress he was making in learning A, B, C. The parent's eyes wandered from the curly-headed pet to his brothers and sisters, who were busily conning their "tasks" for the morrow. With what tranquil feelings they watched the young scholars, whose studies, directed by the holy influence of religion, would prepare them for usefulness here and happiness hereafter, instead of them becoming hypocrites or apostates, as Lord Woolcut's schools would have surely made them.</p> 
               <p>Another cause for rejoicing the parents had on this day-a day which was destined to be an eventful one in their history. A letter had arrived from America, bringing more pleasant tidings than they had of late received from Kathleen.</p> 
               <p>The young couple's first year in the land of their choice had proved an unlucky one. Having, unfortunately, settled in a region where "the ague" was prevalent, they had almost immediately been attacked by it, and after weary months of sickness and discouragement, found<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7227-00000129"/> themselves compelled to sacrifice their little property, and remove to a healthier locality. They were now settled almost on the borders of civilization, cut off from many of the comforts of life. But land was cheap and the climate good; William had begun to clear land for what he designed to make "a tip-top farm," and Kathie was getting used to log-cabin life, and quite enjoyed it; they had occesional opportunities of hearing mass; and had a few neighbors, the nearest not <emph>more</emph> than two miles distant; and their settlement was so favorably located that it <emph>must</emph> grow into one of those marvellous towns which are the peculiar product of the "Great West" So they were now in good heart, and with the genuine spirit of Western settlers contrived to extract amusement out of difficulties and privations.</p> 
               <p>The long letter, full of those minute details which are so interesting to the "folks at home," had been read and talked over many times that day, and still the fond mother took it up again, wishing for the twentienth time, at least, that Mark and Frank were at home. They had gone to a wedding in another parish, bent on enjoying a frolic after their long season of work, and would probably not return till the next morning; but how quickly they would return, thought the mother, if they knew of this long letter from Kathie.</p> 
               <p>At this moment a shadow darkened the doorway near which she was standing: she looked up and beheld the sheriff. O'Loughlin, somewhat surprised at the appearance of the unusual visitor, rose and handed him a chair, with a polite inquiry after his health. Ere the visitor had time to reply one of his bailiffs entered, and requested the family to leave, as he was about to clear the place, and take possession in the landlord's name. Confounded by the unexpected summons the tenant looked from one to the other in mute bewilderment; then the truth flashed upon his mind, and he exclaimed resolutely-</p> 
               <p>"Take possession! Never while I live-in this house I was born, in this house I will die."</p> 
               <p>"Come, now, O'Loughlin, this is nonsense," said the sheriff in a tone of gentle remonstrance. "You know that it is folly for you to think of resisting Lord Woolcut's demands. I brought but a small force, in deference to what I thought would be your wish on such an occasion, but you are well aware that all the force needed can be readily obtained. Better yield peacably."</p> 
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7227-00000130"/> 
               <p>But there was no use in continuing the good counsel. O'Loughlin had pushed his family before him into the adjoining room, and was wildly fastening it against the invaders of his peaceful home. The next moment the door fell in with a crash, parents and children were roughly dragged out by the police, who stood guard over them while the house was being cleared of its contents, and possession legally taken. The officers next proceeded to the barn. O'Loughlin, who had been vainly struggling in the grasp of his captors, freed himself, by a frenzied exertion of all his strength, and rushing after them attacked the sheriff with the fury of a madman, and hurled him to the ground. Short and decisive would have been the contest, for the officer, taken by surprise, was no match for his desperate antagonist; but the bailiffs darted in a body to the rescue of their superior, and bore him, bruised and breathless, to a safe distance. All this time the shrieks of the children were heard above all other sounds, and the mother, with heart-rendering cries, strove to approach her husband, who was again captive in the strong grasp of the minions of the law."</p> 
               <p>"Oh that my brave boys were here to back me!" he cried fiercely. "We would show you that a man is not to be robbed of his land at your pleasure, or the bidding of your villianous employer."</p> 
               <p>"Aisy, now, aisy," said one of the bailiffs soothingly. "Thankful enough you may be to get off so well owin' to the clemency of his honor, the sheriff. Sure its transported you'd be for laying' hands on the Queen's officer. Ho, my brave fellow, see what thanks <emph>you</emph> get for your pains."</p> 
               <p>This was said with a chuckle of delight to one of his comrades, who, in the excess of his zeal, had been busily shoveling potatoes out of their corner of the barn, till his employment was noticed by the sheriff, who angrily ordered him to desist, and put the potatoes back where he found them. The fellow's crest-fallen look, as he sullenly obeyed, was fun to the others, who, were more or less grieved for the unfortunate tenant, and moved even to tears by the bitter anguish of the wife and mother, as having completed their work they retired with haste, leaving the late happy family homeless and griefstricken; the children, now crying more quietly, clinging to one another in a corner of the yard; the father walking up and down with fierce strides, his countenance so dark and lowering,<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7227-00000131"/> that the wife felt instinctively he was revolving some desperate project in his mind, and kept aloof from him, silently indulging her grief, lest a word from her might but fan the flame of vengeful feeling which she longed to allay. At last she could stand it no longer. Laying her hand upon his arm, and speaking in her gentlest tone, she represented that the evening was far spent, and the younger children getting sleepy, it was time to decide what was best to be done.</p> 
               <p>He stopped short and looked down upon her as if just recalled to a sense of her presence. There was a fierce light in his eyes from which she shrank in dismay, for it confirmed her worst fears; but she nerved herself to her duty, and her tearful eyes met his with a gaze of unutterable love-a look, eloquent of the true wifely devotion, that asked no higher earthly boon than to share his fate whatever it might be, braving poverty, hardship, beggary, with uncomplaining meekness-aye, with cheerfulness-if only his love remained. His fierce expression softened as he gazed earnestly on that patient, trusting face. With a sudden burst of emotion he threw his arms about her, and drew her sobbing to his breast, while he poured forth his feelings, not in the cold, measured phrases of the English tongue, but in the beautiful language of his own land-"that tongue docile and spirited as the Arab steed," with its thrilling terms of endearment, and its strength of expression, which could best portray the mingled tenderness and hate that filled his soul in that dark hour-tenderness for the cherished wife, his <foreign xml:lang="GAI">savourneen deelish,</foreign> and the little ones, his <foreign xml:lang="GAI">paschee boght.</foreign> Hatred, bitter, revengeful hatred of the tyranny that doomed those dear ones to become <emph>paupers</emph> in the land of their fathers. Paupers! how he hissed out the bitter word, so full of humiliation to the high-souled man. And his wife clung to him, only murmuring now and then a word of endearment in Irish, waiting for his vehemence to exhaust itself, hoping that in that outburst of passion his mind would find relief, and gain its wonted calmness.</p> 
               <p>It was not without an anxious dread that she again called his attention to the necessity of providing for the children's comfort, and almost overwhelming was her glad surprise when, casting only an irresolute glance toward the silent and dismantled house, he set quietly about removing beds and bedding from the yard where they had been confusedly thrown, to an outhouse, partly sheltered by the barn. A quilt was hung up at the open front as a protection<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7227-00000132"/> from the night air; "though, indeed," said the mother, cheerfully, "the night is so warm and mild there is no danger of their taking cold. Blessings on him!" she added, as she took up the youngest child, who had fallen asleep with his head pillowed on the arm of one of his sisters; "he will sleep here as comfortably as need be this night."</p> 
               <p>How her heart sunk at the rejoinder. "Yes, <emph>this night,</emph> and to-morrow night he will rest once more in the room where he was born."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Michael, Michael! Oh, for the love of our good God, do not make our sad case worse."</p> 
               <p>"Peace; you have nothing to do with this," he interrupted sternly. "I but wait the morning, which will bring back those who are wanted here; with them and a few of the neighbors, I will hold the place against all the force they can bring, or perish in defending the poor remnant of the property that was once my father's."</p> 
               <p>The resolute tone forbade further remonstrance. She could but employ herself in contrivances for her children's comfort; then kneel in the midst of the little band and "give out" the night prayers with the same fervent devotion as if she were still in the dear home over which she had presided so many happy years. Upheld by the spirit of the petition on which her tongue involuntarily lingered, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," her trusting faith and meek submission were evident even to those childish minds. And never could they forget that night when the power of religion shone so brightly in the look and manner of that beloved parent; never forget those night prayers said in the old turf-house.</p> 
               <p>But the husband-the father-joined not in their devotions. The trial had so overwhelmed him-it had come so suddenly in the midst of his glad anticipations-manhood's haughty spirit rose defiantly against the affliction; and tortured anew by every thought of those helpless ones, his heart was incapable of any feeling save of bitterness and desperation. Wrought up to madness by the contemplation of his wrongs, he paced the livelong night up and down before that shed, muttering of justice and vengeance; while hour after hour his wife bent in supplication for him before the throne of grace, all other troubles forgotten in the fear of what the morning might bring. Weeping and praying for him, watching for the return of her absent boys; oh, how her heart sickened at the thought of what those high-spirited youths might be driven to by their<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7227-00000133"/> own angry feelings and their father's desperation.</p> 
               <p>"Father in Heaven, afflict us as Thou seest fit!" was still the burden of her prayer. "We deserve Thy chastisements: but save my poor children from crime, bring back their sorely-tried father to a sense of his duty-let him not lead them astray from Thee!"</p> 
               <p>And thus the night wore away, the beautiful April night, with the lustrous moonlight, resting, like the smile of God, upon the earth so pure, so soft, so holy, shone its radiance on the sin-burdened world, whose cries of woe and tales of oppression and wrong are ever piercing the heavens.</p> 
               <p>But when the clear radiance began to give way to the gray hue of early dawn the poor woman could no longer restrain herself. They might even now be approaching-those dear objects of her solicitude-and she must be where she can see them afar off; she must be the first to meet them, and lay her commands upon them-the good obedient boys-ere their father's tale could arouse the passions that might have been slumbering in their hearts, unknown to themselves and others, even as they had in his. She caught her breath quickly at the thought of incurring her husband's anger. That night had revealed to her a strange phase in his disposition. In the twenty-seven years of mingled joy and sorrow, prosperity and adversity, they had shared, never, until now, had she seen him under the influence of blind, headstrong anger; and it was the more dreadful to her, as she began to understand that his equable temper, of which she had so often boasted, in her wifely pride, was not a natural endowment, but due to the self-control which deep religious feeling had trained into a life-long habit. But now the natural impetuosity, held in restraint so long, had broken its bonds; the flood-gates of passionate, vengeful feelings were opened, and the surging torrent rushed on regardless of all barriers, defying all power to check its headlong course. So it was not without trembling that she came forth from her shelter, and crept timidly by him, shrinking, for the first time, from meeting his glance, with a sort of guilty consciousness that she was about setting herself up in opposition to him-to him, the just, good man, whose word had ever been a law unto her.</p> 
               <p>"Where are you going, Kathleen? Why don't you try to get some sleep?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't feel like sleeping," said she, turning<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7227-00000134"/> back and standing beside him. "God help us to bear this trial! It's come upon us so suddenly, without doubt for some good purpose, as we will see by-and-bye; but, oh! it is hard to bear it as we should bear whatever He sends."</p> 
               <p>"Kathleen, never say that God has had any part in this act of tyranny. This trial, as you call it, comes not from Him-it is the work of a heartless fiend; and may the God of justice avenge our-"</p> 
               <p>A piercing shriek interrupted him. "Oh, Michael! Michael! this is harder than all!" She flung herself upon his neck, and clung to him as if to shield him from some threatened danger. "You've been too good and faithful to your God to turn away from him now, when He's all that's left to us, asthore! Nay, Michael, don't be angry with your poor Kathleen;" she wreathed her arms around him only the more fondly, as he strove impatiently to release himself. "Your wife knows she should be said by you, as she always has-you know that, husband dear; and as she will again, please God! But now you're sorely tried and tempted, and 'tis only sorrow' for them that your heart holds dear that comes between you and the light of heaven. Michael, agra, we've lost our home through striving to keep our children in the right way. We musn't undo our work, risk our own souls, and, perhaps, theirs, now when it pleases our Lord to make trial of our fidelity to Him."</p> 
               <p>Thus she pleaded with him amid sobs and tears, her heart all the while sending up its one only prayer, that He who alone can still the fury of the elements, and of man's rebellious will, would speak the word of "peace" to this tempest-tossed spirit; while her husband stood in moody silence, striving, vainly striving, to banish the better feelings her broken entreaties had awakened. The morning light was growing clearer; the birds had begun their matin song; on a bough just over his head, a little songster had perched, trilling out his melody with such startling purity and sweetness, that the troubled man half started, as if a voice from heaven were speaking to his soul.</p> 
               <p>"Do you hear that bird, Kathleen?" Very sad and subdued was his voice, as he thus broke the silence. "As many April's as I can remember, that little bird-for it has seemed to me always the same-has sung its blithesome lay from that very bough. And often and often I've stood here-aye, just where I stand now-and thought-like enough 'twas a silly fancy-how<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7227-00000135"/> many of my name may have listened to that same sweet melody, and that their happy souls were, perhaps, even then, hovering over the old place they had loved so well."</p> 
               <p>"So they were, without doubt, Michael," returned his wife, eagerly. "And if any of them are looking down this day, oh! don't they give new thanks to God that still another of their race is giving up house and land for the sake of the old Faith? For many and many a one of them gave up all for it-wealth, and power, and life itself. So did some of my own people in the old times."</p> 
               <p>"They did, they did, Kathleen," repeated her husband, fervently.</p> 
               <p>"And I'm thankful to God for it. With His holy blessing we're walking in their footsteps, and so will our children after us."</p> 
               <p>A groan from the conscience-stricken man interrupted her.</p> 
               <p>"God forgive me, for I have had murder in my heart this night," he murmured; and humbled and penitent fell upon his knees.</p> 
               <p>Kathleen raised her eyes in gratitude to heaven, and glided softly back to the shed, leaving him alone with his God. Her fears were quieted now; the tempter's spell was broken; and when, a few moments after, she beheld her sons approaching, she rejoiced amid all her sorrow at feeling there was no need to interrupt their conference with their father.</p> 
               <p>Indignation and rage filled the souls of the young men as they listened. Like their father, their first impulse was to defy all the power of the landlord-to die, if need be, in defending their home-and it was not without deep chagrin that they found him resolute in forbidding this course of action.</p> 
               <p>"Surely, sir," exclaimed Mark vehemently, "you would not counsel base submission to an outrage like this."</p> 
               <p>The excited tone brought the mother forward, fearing, as she saw the hot flush mantle her husband's temples, that the young man's fiery spirit would kindle his own anew.</p> 
               <p>"Listen to your father, Mark-do be said by him, Frank," she pleaded, standing before the enraged youths, and addressing them with mingled authority and entreaty. "He has been your safe-guide and counsellor from your cradle up. Never fear that there'd be shame or dishonor in the course he would have his children pursue, keeping the fear of God before their eyes."</p> 
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7227-00000136"/> 
               <p>"Now, mother, don't bring religion into this matter," began Frank, impatiently; but she interrupted him as eagerly:</p> 
               <p>"Why not, agra? Is there a moment of our lives that should be free from its influence? But why am I talking? My boys know their duty too well to need instruction or reproof from me. Where are you going, Michael?"</p> 
               <p>"Down to Father Dillon's to tell him what has occurred. Remember, boys, you are to stay with your mother in my absence; and she has something you'll be glad to see-a letter from your sister, that maybe will have more influence on your future movements than we know of now."</p> 
               <p>The youths caught eagerly at his parting words. "Does my father think of emigrating? is that his meaning?"</p> 
               <p>"There's no telling how things may turn out," replied their mother, unwilling to discourage a hope which would tend to reconcile them to what had taken place. "This is a very cheering account, you will see. All day yesterday I was wishing you were here to rejoice over the good news from Kathleen."</p> 
               <p>"Would to heaven we had been at home," cried Mark, warmly. "Oh why did not some presentiment hasten our return?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Because a kind Providence was watching over you. Ah, children, how thankful was I last night that you were out of harm's way. What would become of me if"-she paused unable to give utterance to the fears that had so tortured her.</p> 
               <p>"Mother," said Frank, the sunny smile that gave such rare beauty to his face breaking through the anger and gloom that had darkened his brow, "who would think that you ever gloried in your relationship to the writer of this letter! How could you have given your daughter so proudly to a rebel, a contemner of British law? Let me stir up your slumbering patriotism, mother dear, lest it be altogether crushed under this horrid nightmare of submission: for if a similar chance occur in our time don't you think that more of your name will fling themselves as gladly into the strife, whether it lead to glory or the gallows?"</p> 
               <p>The mother looked proudly on the kindling face of her boy. Her native patriotism sparkled in her tear-dimned eyes as she said:</p> 
               <p>"And I would not lay a straw in their way, Frank. No! If the time does come, I would not be the one to keep husband or son back: though my heart would be sore at the parting, I feel<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7227-00000137"/> that I would have courage to bid them God-speed in the good cause. But that would be very different from seeing you led off to the gallows or the convict-ship, for some act of violence, as foolish as wicked. The shame of that would be too much for me, and the sin-O, boys, boys! it would crush the life out of your poor mother to know that the crime of bloodshed-"</p> 
               <p>She broke off shivering with horror at the idea that had presented itself. The two youths turned with a simultaneous impulse to the mother they idolized, and with loving words and embraces calmed her fears.</p> 
               <p>"What a grand time Will is having!" sighed Mark as he glanced again over the letter. "How I envy him his free, wild life in those backwoods of America!"</p> 
               <p>"Wouldn't it be glorious to find ourselves with him and dear Kathie in the land they are beginning to love so well?" exclaimed Frank with enthusiasm. "What a welcome they would give us, mother, and what fine times we should all have together."</p> 
               <p>The patient mother listened with forced smiles as her boys, turning from the contemplation of the gloomy present, sketched out a future in America as bright and untroubled as bouyant young imagination could picture. Her heart sank with a dismal foreboding of separation from them, for she could see that the fancy both had long entertained for emigrating was now settling into a resolve, and she felt assured that her husband would never entertain the thought of leaving the land of his birth. But she would not check their glowing fancies by a word or look of discouragement, but silently thanked God that the fears which had tortured her through the night were all set at rest, and with renewed confidence committed herself and those who were dear to her to His keeping. When she saw her husband returning, she whispered them "not to talk any more of emigrating just now;" and the young fellows readily understanding her meaning, dropped the subject, and helped in the preparations for an immediate removal, with a cheerfulness and alacrity surprising to their father, and in truth somewhat aggravating.</p> 
               <p>With a sigh he reflected that the old place was not to them what it was to him. Every tree, and bush, and stone, was dear to him, connected with some memory that endeared them to his mind forever. The proudest castle in the land he would have esteemed a poor exchange for that humble home-that little corner of the vast<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7227-00000138"/> possessions which had owned the O'Loughlin's for masters ere the evil days had come of confiscations and penal laws. But the boys had little share in these feelings. To them the place was dear as the home of their childhood, but other places could become <emph>home</emph> and possess equal charms. The losses entailed by this removal-the shame of being evicted-the thought of seeing others gain by their loss, reaping what <emph>they</emph> had sowed-these things weighed most heavily on the high-spirited youths.</p> 
               <p>But the cup of humiliation was not yet drained: there was still a bitter potion remaining. They must see house and land handed over to one of the landlord's pet converts-one of that despicable class whom "the soupers" had "won over" during the famine time, and who still remained true to "the new lights" whose false glare had arisen on that era of gloom and woe. What were the feelings of the brothers as they beheld this worthy coming up the road, accompanied by the sheriff, who opened the house and went in with the new tenant to take a survey of the premises. This insult, added to injury, was too much for the young men's patience or philosophy. With lowering brows they turned from gazing on the convert, and, as each met the flashing glance of the other, hand clasped hand in token of a mutual determination that instant formed. They had not spoken, yet the next moment their secret purpose was rebuked by a solemn voice close beside them.</p> 
               <p>"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord!"</p> 
               <p>Startled and abashed, the youths turned toward the speaker-Frank, with a forced laugh, exclaiming: "Ah, father, you are our good genius-always beside us when we least expect your presence!"</p> 
               <p>"And when you least desire it, probably," returned the father, with a grave smile. "Without laying claim to occult powers, I can divine that my appearance just now is as unwelcome as unexpected."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Father Dillon," said Mark, making an effort to hide his annoyance under an air of recklessness, "I'll not be so unmannerly as to gainsay your powers of divination. Just now, your appearance is less welcome, I admit, than it would be at any other moment."</p> 
               <p>"And what of the unseen Presence, before whom you have not shrunk from forming schemes which you are unwilling that I should surmise? No, no, my children; these petty plans of revenge<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7227-00000139"/> venge are not to be put into execution. They are as unworthy of Irishmen as unbecoming to Christians."</p> 
               <p>"But, father, you have not seen what we have: a sight to set one's heart and brain on fire," cried Mark, excitedly.</p> 
               <p>"I have seen all-I understand all, my boy. Your bitter feelings are natural, and hard to be controlled in such a case, I know. Still, why should you entertain resentment against the miserable creature who, a thousand times more irrational than Esau, has sacrificed his glorious birthright of faith for a paltry recompense from his tempters? Believe me, he is more to be pitied than blamed. All these things are but parts of a system which must, ere long, be overthrown. Until that day comes, our duty is to endure-patience and forbearance must be our motto."</p> 
               <p>"But if that day never comes," muttered Frank, in a tone of impatience.</p> 
               <p>"It will come," was the confident reply. "Perhaps these very acts of tyranny, under which we are so restive, may be intended, in the order of Providence, to bring about the end for which we wait so longingly. Yes; the time will come when Ireland's sons may rally around her with burning souls and strong arms, battling for her rights and their own. Keep your energies in reserve for that time, my brave boys-you will need them all then."</p> 
               <p>"And then," said Frank, looking up to his be loved pastor with a beaming smile, "then, father, you will be with us."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, in that struggle I am with you, heart and soul. Next to my wish for heaven after death, is my wish during life to see Ireland free-free forever, from Saxon rule in any shape."</p> 
               <p>The boys unconsciously drew closer to the enthusiastic priest. How grand he looked at that moment-his noble countenance glowing with patriotic fire-his eloquent eyes uplifted to that heaven in which he trusted for the redemption of his long-suffering country from a bondage the bitterness of which he knew full well.</p> 
               <p>Never had the young O'Loughlins regarded their parish priest with such entire love and confidence, as at this moment, when he stood before them, seeming the impersonation of those two sublime feelings which are so closely connected in the Irish heart-love of God and love of country. Their eyes sparkling with enthusiasm akin to his own, it was with an impulsive ardor, that told more eloquently than a thousand<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7227-00000140"/> protestations how implicitly they would follow his guidance, that they voluntarily tendered the promise to refrain from offering insult or injury to the miserable apostate against whom their wrath had but now burned so fiercely.</p> 
               <p>No wonder that the enemies of Catholicity and Ireland dread the influence of "the priest;" that they grow terribly in earnest when depicting the enormous power thus wielded, and exhaust their ingenuity in devising means to weaken that potent influence, and emancipate "the poor, deluded creatures" from the chains they hug so fondly. Yet, how often are these champions of <emph>freedom</emph> indebted to that bugbear-the Catholic priest-for escape from the punishment they merit, at the hand of those whom they drive almost to desperation by their injustice. How quickly the trembling tyrants, and their abettors, look to "the priest," whose wonderful influence is so desirable <emph>just then!</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>A word from Father Dillon directed the young men's attention to their father, from whose demeanor in this painful crisis they could derive instruction and encouragement. If he who rules his own spirit is greater than he who takes a city, how truly great was this deeplyinjured man, as he stood conversing quietly with the sheriff, whom he had accosted for the purpose of offering a manly apology for his fierce assault on the previous evening. The courteous officer received the explanation as frankly as it was given. From his own feelings he could make every allowance for what had been done under such circumstances. He acknowledged, however, that O'Loughlin's frantic resistance had greatly surprised him, since he had attempted nothing of the kind on a similar occasion a few months previous. But he soon understood the great difference between <emph>then</emph> and <emph>now.</emph> In November, O'Loughlin had been, in a manner, prepared for the appearance of the crowbar brigade on his premises. Having shared in the <emph>crime</emph> of his evicted neighbors, he had no reason to look for an exemption from the doom which had befallen them. At this time, too, the eviction would not have been so disastrous. The harvest was gathered in, an ample supply of food stored away for the winter, and a good sum of money in hand after recent sales of produce. And, though it had been painful to him to think of leaving his old home, he could have procured a better and larger farm, under a better landlord, some of whose tenants were about to emigrate. How bitterly did he regret having trusted to the<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7227-00000141"/> delusive clemency which had spared him then, only by a refinement of cruelty, to pounce upon him at a time when there was no vacant farm in the neighborhood; when the winter's expenditure and the aid given to his suffering neighbors had left him almost penniless; when the planting time was over, and every thing for the year depending on the fruits of that planting. But regret was of no avail now. The "pardon" so unexpectedly granted-certainly without any solicitation or promise of amendment on his part-had been as unexpectedly revoked, just at the time when the punishment would fall most heavily.</p> 
               <p>The sheriff assented to the justness of his complaints; but informed him that Lord Woolcut had not revoked the pardon granted in November. It was for a later offence against his Lordship, that O'Loughlin was now evicted, namely, the enormity of which he, or his sons rather, had been guilty, in hauling off stone from the property of Miss Woolcut for the priests school house!</p> 
               <p>O'Loughlin looked incredulously at the sheriff, who made this explanation with all the gravity imaginable. Then, the Irishman's quick sense of the ludicrous and absurd overcoming his indignation dignation, he suddenly broke forth into a hearty burst of laughter, much to the worthy sheriff's amazement.</p> 
               <p>"Well, well," he exclaimed, after explaining to those who eagerly crowded around him, the cause of his sudden mirthfulness. "Thank God I can laugh yet! Little I thought any thing could draw a laugh from me this day. After all, Kathleen, I believe it is just as well for us to be done with this high-minded Lord Bishop, and that sweet, gentle lady, his daughter."</p> 
               <p>Kathleen could not join in her husband's transient fit of merriment. The sorrowful moment for leaving had arrived: it was all she could do to maintain an appearance of calmness, for the sake of the children, who were all watching their parents so wistfully, the younger ones unable to understand the trouble that had come so suddenly.</p> 
               <p>But her tears could no longer be restrained when, on reaching a turn of the road the whole family paused, as by one common impulse, to take a last lingering survey of the spot so dear to all. Had it ever looked as beautiful as at that moment? Did ever the sun smile so brightly before on those smooth fields, where the soft rich green of the early wheat and clover, contrasted<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7227-00000142"/> trasted so prettily with the rich brown of the fields, whose treasures were only begining to peep above the mellow surface? And the snug old farm house, with its neat kitchen garden, in which, only yesterday, the industrious "housemother" had sowed the last of her early seeds; the pretty flower garden, in which the dear girl, now far beyond the Atlantic's waves, had often worked so busily, and whose every bush and shrub was prized more than ever since her departure. No; the mother could not take the long, yearning look she coveted, for the blinding tears would flow. She fell on her knees, and buried her face in her hands, in an agony of grief that could not be stayed. The children crowded about her echoing her convulsive sobs. The men and women who had so often worked merrily in those fields, and who had come with sad eagerness to help in the sorrowful moving, set up a wild, mournful wail that sounded strangely amidst the pleasant sights and sounds of that bright spring morning.</p> 
               <p>A mute gesture from O'Loughlin hushed the loud lament. With a natural impulse of pride he scorned to give his persecutors the mean satisfaction, he knew they were capable of taking, in the "reports" that would reach them; and there was manly dignity as well as tender affection, in the manner in which he raised and comforted his patient wife, who was now hastily choking back the rush of feeling that for the moment had overcome her fortitude.</p> 
               <p>The priest had gone forward with the older children, affecting to chat pleasantly with them, while his heart, so full of every generous and kindly feeling, was aching for the woes of this good family. O'Loughlin threw his arm around his wife, and led her onward with a gentleness that ill accorded with the tumultuous feelings that agitated him at that moment. He was leading her away in poverty and sorrow from the home to which he had so proudly conducted her, a happy bride-leading her to the only place where they now could find shelter-an old school-house, which the kind priest had fitted up as well as his limited means would allow, as a temporary refuge for some of their fellow sufferers by landlord bigotry and oppression. And he had seen the God forsaken creature, who had sold his faith, and his children's faith, for the bread that perishes, coolly surveying the late tenants from afar with a grin of exultation, and then turning away with an insolent leer to strut among the beautiful fields that he had "got so<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7227-00000143"/> snug," ploughed and planted to his hand. For was not all his? the growing crops, the labor of father, sons, and assistants for many busy weeks past, as well as all the little improvements and embellishments which taste had impelled the family to make, at the expense of toil and money-had not all come into his possession now, thanks to "his lordship, the Bishop?" Let the evicted tenant murmur of injustice, or demand a shilling of compensation, if he dared. Was not all done legally, and were not what he called his wrongs a portion of that enlightened and benevolent code of laws, by which England governs her sister Isle?</p> 
               <p>Yes, as Dr. Cahill wrote on his very subject: "English Imperial legislation is known only to the Catholics of Ireland by its persecuting landlord tyranny, its depopulated fields, its leveled villages, its proselytising poor-houses. Its character may be best learned in the bands of destitute, broken hearted emigrants, of children torn from parents, of guileless girls wrenched from home, all wending their mournful way to the next Irish port, to seek in a foreign country the protection, the support, the roof, which, in their struggle for life, are denied to them at home. The whole world can present few pictures of national legislation and distress more crushing than the history of Ireland, during the last fifteen years. And what renders our case so unendurable is, that our national tyrannies are said to be <emph>just</emph> because they are <emph>legal;</emph> our expulsion is urged as tenable, because it is done according to the <emph>law</emph> of landlord and tenant, and our complaints, our tears are declared seditious and rebellious, because the <emph>law</emph> by which we are starved and killed is the <emph>law</emph> of the English Constitution. Alas! this fiction of calling the most ferocious action by the name of law, is the cruel, perfidious device by which the people of Ireland have been robbed and murdered. The iniquity of human law received its final definition on Calvary, where the Messiah was put to death by the laws of the Roman Emperor; and the laws of England in their application to Ireland are best understood in your tenantless soil, your deserted harbors, and in the hundreds of thousands of wandering Irish children, who are seen going, in this country, from town to town, in search of one peaceful, solitary spot where they can rest their weary limbs, and lay down their aching heads, free from the insults of the infidel Biblical, and from the terrors of the merciless landlord." (Letter of the Rev. Dr. Cahill to the People of Ireland, May, 1861.)</p>

               <head type="sub">The Evicted Tenants.</head> 
               <p>IF there be truth in the old adage, that "misery loves company," the Bartry-more sufferers were not without consolation, for other evictions of refractory tenants rapidly followed, the war being carried on with commendable vigor by the noble army of proselytising landlords in that ill-fated neighborhood. Among the later victims of this zeal for religion some were tenants of Lord Woolcut, and a still larger number of his daughter, who lost no time in following the good example of her noble father, and "ridding" her estate of intractable "Romanists."</p> 
               <p>A short period of inaction followed. The zealous "promulgators of the gospel" took a resting spell. Perhaps the Lord Bishop was deterred for a time from the prosecution of his relentless policy, by the unenviable notoriety he had gained ed. For the parish priest of Bartrymore had taken care to have the history of those "three days in November" spread far and wide; and Lord Woolcut's cruelty was almost universally denounced as an outrage against humanity as well as against the rights of conscience. Even the "London Times" was roused to indignation, and pronounced the Landlord's conduct "a hideous scandal.</p> 
               <p>But in one quarter the proselytising bishop found advocates ready not only to excuse but to applaud the barbarity of which he had been guilty; and the course pursued by Parliament, in reference to a matter in which the voice of humanity should have silenced the promptings of bigotry and intolerance, ought surely have sufficed to enlighten those who profess to believe that "justice to Ireland" can be obtained in "a legal and peaceful way, through the medium of the Imperial Parliament of Great Britian and Ireland." When the mournful story of those evicted families was told, forcibly and with touching pathos, by two of the Irish members, it might have been expected that every member of the House would be willing to denounce such atrocities as unworthy of "the great nineteenth century, which is so often eulogized in that assembly<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7227-00000145"/> sembly as the age of toleration, philanthropy, and all other christian virtues. But, on the contrary, one honorable member hastened to justify all that the landlord had done, saying that "the charge against him was that he had attempted on a grand scale a system of proselytising. As a Protestant Bishop, he would have been guilty of a gross dereliction of duty if he had not done so. It was the duty of the Lord Bishop and of every Protestant landlord to attempt the reclamation of their tenantry from the social evil of Romanism. In another part of this speech the <emph>intelligent</emph> and <emph>truthful</emph> speaker boldly asserted that "the evils of Ireland are directly traceable to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Priests." The "defence" of Lord Woolcut was continued by two of the "Tory leaders," who recklessly asserted that the tenants had been evicted in consequence of some breach of law-regardless of the fact, that his lordship's agent and teachers had admitted that the evictions were intended to strike terror into those who refused to comply with his "earnest desire." They next proceeded to assail the character of the holy and intrepid Priest, whose vigilance had protected the little ones of his flock against the snare laid for them. It was so much easier to bring false charges against the unfortunate tenants and their Pastor, than to answer the true one against their favorite Bishop. But, while laboring to set the matter in dispute in a false light, both gentlemen carefully abstained from saying a word in condemnation of landlords evicting honest and in dustrious tenants, merely because they refused to send their children to the proselytising schools. Neither they, nor any of their party, found fault with the plea advanced by the former speaker, that the Protestant Bishop was bound in duty to attempt a system of proselytising "on a grand scale." In pleasing contrast with the various harangues, which seemed to rival one another in ignorance and violence, was a speech of a member, on the government side, who defended the evicted tenants from the charge of "Ribbonism," and "offence against the law," so recklessly uttered by the other speakers; and traced all the evils which had taken place to the Bishop's system of proselytism. This gentleman (Mr. Cardwell) nobly avowed his detestation of the cruel policy of the Lord Bishop, and his sympathy with the innocent victims; yet even he stopped short of wishing justice done in the case, for "he could not see what would be gained" by having the subject referred to a Committee of the House for investigation.</p> 
               <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7227-00000146"/> 
               <p>Well might Ireland's noblest, truest patriot, Smith O'Brien, say to the Irish people-"You have tried the intervention of English Whigs, you have tried the intervention of English Tories, in regard to the affairs of Ireland. Both of these parties have failed to satisfy the requirements of the Irish nation. They have at one time caressed and duped you; at another time they have coerced and oppressed you."</p> 
               <p>Happy would it be for the people of Ireland if they were practically to remember this earnest warning, from one to whose memory they owe the deepest gratitude. Happier still, if, casting to the winds the miserable dissentions and differences so artfully fostered among them by the common enemy, they would resolutely set themselves to carrying out the policy, so affectionately and cheeringly urged in the same eloquent letter, written by Mr. O'Brien to Mr. Maguire, M. P., in 1861:-</p> 
               <p>"Let us now try what we can do for ourselves. Let us seek to establish in and out of Parliament-at home and abroad-in the British colonies, and amongst foreign nations, a party which shall not be a Whig or a Tory party; which shall not be an English party; nor a French party, but which shall be thoroughly Irish, and truly national. Now, since about three-fourths of the Irish people profess the Catholic faith, as taught by the Church of Rome, it is natural and right that the Catholics should take the lead in such a movement; but I feel convinced that there are many thousands of Irish Protestants, who would resist to the death the introduction of a French army into this country, yet would sincerely rejoice to witness the re-establishment of the <emph>automony</emph>-the self-government of Ireland by a domestic Parliament-and who would earnestly co-operate with an Irish party, if it were guided by wisdom and toleration. Let me then appeal to such men as you and The O'Donoghue-let me appeal to the influential journalists-let me appeal to the patriotic clergy-let me appeal to such of the landlords as love Ireland-let me entreat you and them to set on foot the formation of such a party. Make once more this experiment! It is my belief that the Irish nation will respond to your exertions, even though universal distrust has been generated by the failure of former efforts. There is a spring of hope in the Irish breast, which may be repressed for an hour, but which will irresistibly discover a vent for its gushing stream. Unlock that reservoir, and it will<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7227-00000147"/> overspread this land with a fertilizing flood, which shall revive to a new vegetation the latent seeds of our national regeneration."</p> 
               <p>Is this a digression? Even so, we will not so misjudge the readers of our humble pages, as to deem it necessary to apologize for pausing to cull this "thought-blossom," so full of eloquence and feeling. For where is the Irish heart that does not throb with quickened pulse at the mention of WILLIAM SMITH O'BRIEN? Where the lover of Ireland or of liberty, that loves not to linger over every reminiscence of him, who was at once the tolerant Christian and ardent patriot-the long suffering and indomnitable "confessor of Freedom"-the disinterested "friend and champion of his countrymen always, their flatterer, never?" Alas for the land of his love, that she must be a mourner now over his tomb, that the talents and virtues so well fitted for her guidance are lost to her forever! And yet, if the day of "national regeneration," the day to which he looked forward with "passionate aspiration" ever dawn on Erin-if her sons manfully rise up to devote to their country's cause, the heroism and energy they so lavishly display in the service of other lands-from that honored grave at Cahirmoyle, as from the unmarked resting-place of Emmet, will come "the thrilling whisper" that will urge them on to noble deeds.</p> 
               <p>Happily for the credit of human nature the unjust and illiberal spirit, manifested by the British Parliament, found few imitators. Deep sympathy was every where manifested for the Bartrymore victims; sympathy not confined merely to words, grateful as even these were to the feelings of the sufferers. The touching story of their wrongs and their heroic fidelity found an echo in other lands. The Bishop of Orleans, the eloquent and intrepid defender of the rights of the Pope, with that ever active benevolence which distinguishes him, even among a Hierarchy renowned for every generous and noble quality, proposed to preach a sermon in the church of St. Roch, Paris, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pour les pauvres Irlandais.</foreign> A ludicrous circumstance gave additional interest to this sermon, and, by drawing even more attention to it than it was sure to have received from the fame of the gifted preacher, added both to the notoriety of the unfortunate Lord Woolcut, and to the amount of material aid contributed by the Parisians to his victims.</p> 
               <p>As "St. Patrick's day" was near at hand, and moreover fell that year on Sunday, some of the "Sassenachs" in Paris, who heard of the proposed<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7227-00000148"/> posed sermon for the poor Irish, jumped to the conclusion that <emph>that</emph> day was the one appointed for the purpose: what could come more <foreign xml:lang="FRA">apropos?</foreign> But, unluckily for the wise prognostications of John Bull, a festival was approaching, which, to the Catholic bishop, was of infinitely more importance than even the feast of Ireland's great saint, and much more appropriate for his charity sermon. The festival of the Annunciation-that time-honored anniversary of the hallowed day when the Angel's message to the Virgin of Nazareth announced that the time of the world's redemption was at hand-what more suitable day than the one on which "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us," to enlist the feelings of the pious and humane in behalf of the victims of misfortune, and urge them to give freely in honor of Him who considers as done to Himself what is done even to the least of His brethren!</p> 
               <p>But stubborn Johnny Bull had "got hold of an idea," and the world knows he is pretty good at holding fast to whatever he gets; so on the 21st of March the London Morning Post had the pleasure of laying before its patrons a letter from "our Paris correspondent," commenting on the charity sermon preached in the Church of St. Roch, by the Bishop of Orleans, <emph>on the Sunday</emph>
                   
                  <emph>previous!</emph> The brilliant and ingenious writer described this sermon as-</p> 
               <p>"Repeating every abominable falsehood, embodying every possible accusation of cruelty, tyranny, and religious persecution against the Bishop of Tuam, and ignoring altogether the remotest doubt of their absolute truth."</p> 
               <p>And giving his lively imagination full scope, ne ventured to entertain his readers with the surmise that, as</p> 
               <p>"Roman Catholic priests, like the Roman augurs, cannot meet each others' eyes without a smile, there must have been rare merriment in the sacristy of St. Roch, after the sermon of Monsignor Dupanloup."</p> 
               <p>These extracts may serve as specimens of the "criticism" published nearly a week in advance of the sermon. What a commentary on the spirit manifested by a portion of the impartial and infallible press of Great Britain, in its dealings with Irish affairs, and with those of Catholics in general.</p> 
               <p>But the blunder of the ingenious letter-writer was not the only one to which this famous sermon gave rise. The Right Reverend hero of the November evictions heard of Monsignor Dupanloup's intention, and, with all the cowardice of<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7227-00000149"/> conscious guilt, imagined that the object of the sermon must be to denounce <emph>his</emph> cruelty and oppression. In the plenitude of his wisdom he thinks to prevent the anticipated censure making the impresssion he fears on the public mind, by writing an indgnant protest, designating the French prelate's discourse as "a remarkable falsehood," and "a scaffolding of calumnies;" and still farther to display his common sense, he sends this "protest against the sermon about to be delivered" to the British ambassador at Paris, by whom it is immediately given to the world through the columns of the <title>Journal des Debats.</title> Here, indeed, was cause sufficient for "rare merriment" to the lively and sarcastic Parisians. The grotesque blunders of newspaper correspondent, Lord Bishop, and Ambassador, set "all Paris in a roar," and furnished occasion for innumerable jests and satires on "those poor English," whom Madame de Stel aptly described as having two left hands. In the midst of the mirthful sensation thus excited, the noble prelate, whose "remarkable falsehood" was thus politely contradicted in advance, sent to the <title>Journal des Debats</title> a letter which was generally applauded as an admirable specimen of that epistolary talent for which his country is distinguished guished, and which we therefore take the liberty of transcribing in full:</p>

                           <p>"SIR:-Permit me to express some surprise at your having inserted in your paper of the 22d inst., a letter, having for its object to protest beforehand against a charity sermon which I have to preach in Paris on the 25th, for the Irish poor.</p> 
                           <p>"The writer of that letter, Mr --, Lord Bishop of the Anglican Church, and a rich proprietor in Ireland, designates my future words as a 'scaffolding of calumnies.' He is a very clever man, if he knows what I shall say, for I humbly confess that I am not quite so well informed on that point as he is.</p>

                           <p>"I do not mean to accuse any one, nor yet to contest that Bishop's right to dismiss his tenants in the winter season. I merely congratulate him on not being a Bishop in the States of the Church. To what accusations would he not be exposed at this moment throughout all England!</p> 
                           <p>"As for myself, who am a Catholic Bishop, wheresoever I find poverty, if I inquire into the cause of it, I seek above all to diminish the weight of it. This will be the whole object of my sermon, by the leave of Bishop --, whose cause has been sufficiently judged, and about whom I have no intention to occupy myself. I surrender to his criticisms my sermon the moment it has issued from my lips. But, though much habituated to discussion, this is the first time that I have had to answer for words which have not as yet been uttered.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>Thus the unfortunate Anglican Bishop had only succeeded in giving fresh prominence to his particular share in producing the sufferings of the Irish poor. However indifferent to the cause of his evicted tenants the people of Paris had hitherto been, they could not fail to have their curiosity now excited on the subject. The result was that the Church of St. Roch was filled with a vast crowd on the afternoon of the feast of the Annunciation, there being not less than four thousand persons present, according to the estimate of the Paris correspondent of the London Times. As to the sermon, we will take the same gentleman's description of it, in preference to quoting Catholic authority:</p> 
               <p>"It was, in fact, a <emph>lecture</emph> on Ireland as a nation, illustrated with quotations portraying its superiority in religious tenacity, in patriotism, in martial courage, in domestic life, and especially its powers of endurance in suffering, personal and political. It took two hours in delivery, and was listened to with breathless attention The preacher announced at the outset his purpose to commit his statements at once to print, and warmly repudiated 'the charges made against him by anticipation.' 'I come not here,' he said, 'to add a fresh irritation to the wounds of controversy-I am here solely to advocate the cause of misfortune, not to perform the part of an accuser. This is not a political question, nor is it one of religious controversy; but it is a just and heavenly cause, conducting me to a higher region than that of human politics, where the human heart may linger to survey by turns, what is pure and exalted, and what is abased and trampled upon.' He then proceeded, in the highest strains of French eloquence, to hold up the national points of character, introducing some telling allusions to O'Connell, McMahon, and the assimilation of the Celtic to the Gallic type of character."</p> 
               <p>Such was the discourse which had so oddly excited the fears and drawn forth the blundering protests of the "Anglican Bishop" and his friends. Those who heard or read it could be at no loss to decide which production was most entitled to be called "abominable falsehoods," or "scaffolding of calumnies." The gifted preacher had the satisfaction of knowing that the cause he advocated<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7227-00000151"/> cated was benefitted by the false charges made against him; for the sermon was no less successful as a work of charity than as a noble effort of learning and eloquence. The Empress Eugenie-blessings on her generous heart-that is ever raedy to respond to the cry of misery! sent her contribution. The ladies of the Court set a noble example of charity, which was widely imitated; so that the result of the much-abused sermon was a very tangible proof of French sympathy for the persecuted children of Erin.</p> 
               <p>The holy priest of Bartrymore received, with a father's joy and gratitude, this noble offering to his "poor people." Added to the aid received at home from "good Christians like yourself" (as he wrote to Smith O'Brien), it enabled him to provide for the most pressing wants of his distressed parishioners, and to secure their eventual comfort by procuring an interest in good farming land, on which to settle them as soon as the preliminary arrangements could be made and cabins built. This would be a work of time, but meanwhile the evicted tenants could comfort themselves with the prospect of again having homes of their own; and who that knows the gratitude of which the Celtic heart is capable, could doubt that their prayers were pure and fervent enough to call down blessings on the generous benefactors who had made the cause of the poor and persecuted their own!</p> 
               <p>And yet the patient sufferers had much to trouble and annoy them. Those new homes in a strange neighborhood would never be to them like those from which they had been so rudely driven; and there was still much to be endured before they would be finally settled in them, notwithstanding all that charity and kindness could accomplish. The health of most of them had suffered from the inclemency of the weather at the time of the evictions. Their few household effects had been damaged in the frequent removals from one place of shelter to another; and their horses and cattle were but little more than skeletons after the winter's exposure among the mountains, lacking both food and shelter.</p> 
               <p>To add to their distress, the large crops so generally calculated on, which would have enabled kind friends to give them substantial assistance, did not reward the farmer's toil. The summer was an unfavorable one, and proved the forerunner of a period of want and misery throughout "the West," almost as severe as the memorable famine of 1846 and 1847. Again the hopes of the "Irish Church Missionary Establishment" brightened;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7227-00000152"/> again the walls of Exeter Hall echoed with "good news from Ireland," and purses were freely opened for the support of the Missions which surely could not fail of being successful now, when cruel laws, oppressive taxes, and bad seasons were producing the bitterest destitution among the poorer classes in Connaught.</p> 
               <p>But, through all, their fidelity to the old religion remained unshaken, and the hopes and schemes of the proselytisers once more came to naught. Watched over with affectionate and unwearied care by devoted priests and bishops; sustaining one another's sinking "courage" by lively sympathy, and that unanswerable reflection "it is the will of God," with which the pious peasant consoles himself with child-like submission and confidence under every affliction; the faithful people of Connaught stifl preserved untarnished that bright gem of faith which was the richest ornament of Erin's crown in the ages of her power and glory, and which centuries of fell tyranny and persecution have been unable to pluck from her brow.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">The Bishop's Pound.</head> 
               <p>A Sunday morning in early summer-one of those beautiful days that seem to speak of joy to the sorrowing, and hope to the downcast; so full of mellowed brightness, of pure, heavenly radiance. The most troubled heart in Bartrymore felt its tranquilizing influence. Earth's cares, and sorrows, and temptations seemed matters of but little moment, and the merry laugh and good humored joke went from one group to another, that wended happily along to the cross-crowned church, the one central point of interest to those faithful Christians.</p> 
               <p>It had rained heavily through the night, but now the sun is breaking gloriously through the white, half-transparent clouds that are scattered over the smiling sky; and the daisy-bespangled turf, and the sweet hawthorn brambles that line the way, are all the more fresh and beautiful<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7227-00000153"/> from the liquid jewels with which night has dowered them. The air is full of fragrance and softness, and vocal with the rich notes of the thrush and blackbird, ringing out a joyous melody that thrills every heart.</p> 
               <p>But hark, what harsh noises are those which suddenly break in upon the sweet harmonys of nature? A confused chorus of horrid sounds-neighing, lowing, braying and bleating-proceeding apparently from the church yard, fills the wondering congregation with horror and un-definable dread. While some shrink back, others spring upon the wall of the church yard, and behold a spectacle which might well madden cooler and more phlegmatic nature than those horror-struck beholders can claim. Close beside the grave yard Lord Woolcut had built his "Pound," so close, indeed, that a part of the grave yard wall had been torn down to accomodate the wall of the "Bishop's Pound." Could any sight be more galling to those warm-hearted people, whose friends and kindred reposed in that consecrated church yard! For a moment grief and indignation chained every tongue, and held every eye fixed on the horrifying spectacle. The remains of the dear and honored dead on one side of the wall-on the other the half-starved captive beasts, whose fierce plunges and frantic cries of rage and distress were horrible to hear. Had "a breach of the peace" that instant resulted-had those deeply-tried men, already goaded almost beyond human indurance, rushed forth to retaliate on their enemies this cruel and unprovoked insult to the living and the dead, who could have blamed them? In fact an unbiased person would be apt to imagine that such a result was expected and desired; else surely his Lordship, in having his pound removed from its former location, would have had it built on some spot of his extensive property, where it would not be a nuisance and an outrage on the feelings of thousands of human beings. Even if those warm and tender feelings-that deep reverence for the House of God-that loving respect for the remains of the faithful departed-for which the Celtic race is so eminently distinguished, were only <emph>superstitions</emph> in the estimation of the enlightened Bishop of the State Church, still as a humane man, a zealous upholder of the law, and a professing Christian, he would have scorned to offer such a wanton insult to that Christian congregation.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps, in the long catalogue of the Lord Bishop's outrages on the peaceful and unoffending<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7227-00000154"/> ing people of Bartrymore, none was so heinous as this; none so well calculated to make "rebellious" or "seditious" feeling burst all restraint. And yet, it was borne. The natural indignation, the burning sense of injury was controlled, not by fear-oh no, the most unscrupulous maligner would scarcely bring <emph>that</emph> charge against Irish character-but by the sublime influence of that creed to which they only clung the more tenaciously, the more they were doomed to suffer for its sake. And many a whispered "amen" responded to the heartfelt ejaculation of one weeping woman-</p> 
               <p>"God forgive you, Lord Woolcut-you're a hard man and a cruel one-but may the Lord open your eyes to the truth! That's all the harm I wish you this day."</p> 
               <p>So the pound was left undisturbed; nor could Father Dillon's urgent remonstrances prevail on the ruling powers to have this obnoxious relic of by-gone times removed to a more appropriate site. The Lord Bishop had chosen to place it in close proximity to the "Popish Chapel," and there it should remain. What matter that the instructions of the pastor were broken in upon, by the shrill cries of impounded animals; that the sweet strains of the rustic choir, chanting the praise of the Most High, were overpowered by the horrid clamor from the Bishop's pound; that every prayer of the fervent or penitent soul to its Creator, was interupted by the howls and yells of the starving brutes, jarring on the feelings of the kneeling worshippers?</p> 
               <p>During three months they submitted to this outrage, to the astonishment of their watchful enemies, and undoubtedly to their disappointment; for now another provocation was given to the too patient people.</p> 
               <p>Coming to hear Mass one Sunday in August, the congregation were struck with mingled sadness and indignation on finding the church windows broken. This sacrilege was the work of some of the convert settlers, who gloried in manifesting the liberty they enjoyed of vexing and injuring the papists. Their laudable purpose they were able to carry out with the greater impunity, as Lord Woolcut had taken care to remove all the Catholic families from the neighborhood of the parish church, and "their places"-as Father Dillon wrote to Sir Robert Peel, "were occupied by bullocks, sheep, and Protestant settlers."</p> 
               <p>The spectacle presented by St. Patrick's church on this Sunday, the good Father averred,<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7227-00000155"/> would "have shocked the heart of any man not totally bereft of the sense of religion." What then must have been the feelings of that ardent congregation, whose holiest affections were indissolubly twined around that sacred temple of religion? Human nature could not brook this indignity, and some of the settlers who, from a safe distance, were watching curiously to see "how the papists would take it," were seized with consternation, on beholding those sturdy fellows turn away from the church with looks and exclamations of ungovernable passion. What would they do? Would they rush headlong to the Protestant church, and retaliate the outrage, or avenge themselves by demolishing the dwellings of those pet "converts," who occupied the homes for a mile around, from which they had been ruthlessly driven?</p> 
               <p>No. Even in that moment of fierce excitement, not one of those "deluded and benighted Romanists" dreamed of seeking revenge for the desecration of their holy temple, by injuring any building erected for purposes of Christian worship, however erroneous they deemed the religion taught therein; nor, save among a few of the wildest spirits, was a thought entertained of attacking the settlers, making the innocent suffer along with the guilty. But a simultaneous rush was made for the pound, and in a very few moments its wall was levelled to the ground.</p> 
               <p>"There!" cried Mark O'Loughlin, one of the most active in the work, "If the Lord Bishop has wit enough to learn a lesson from this, so much the better for him-let him understand that whatever else he may do, his power to insult and trample on us, shall not extend to the house of God."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, it was but folly for us to allow it from the first," exclaimed another whose words had the more weight from his usually quiet demeanor. "If we had resisted this outrage our church would not have the mark of sacriligious hands to-day."</p> 
               <p>"True for you, Mr. Boyle. They thought it was afraid of them we were, and we only striving to keep the hot blood down as in duty bound; but, faith, if they put us to it-"</p> 
               <p>"Come, come, boys, no threats nor fuss now," put in the deep voice of Michael O'Loughlin. "We've pulled down that which we should never have allowed to be built on this spot, and I believe we are all agreed that it shall never stand here again."</p> 
               <p>A loud, energetic response from all present gave token of the general determination.</p> 
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7227-00000156"/> 
               <p>"Then let there be an end of the matter now. We'll go quietly into church, in the name of God, for it's full time."</p> 
               <p>The crowd, feeling the propriety of his counsel, and satisfied with what they had done, dropped off one by one, composing their ruffled tempers to a proper mood for entering the sacred temple. But some whispered that "as to having an end of the matter the end had not come yet," to which others nodded assent and whispered in turn, "we'll see it out with them now that they've put us to it."</p> 
               <p>And truly the matter was not to end so easily, for Lord Woolcut still cherished his unlucky propensity for giving the utmost notoriety to deeds which it would have been wiser to leave sink into oblivion. No attention had been paid to Father Dillon's remonstrances, against what he had truly designated a nuisance and a trespass; no concern had been manifested for the breaking of the church windows; but as soon as rude hands were laid on <emph>that</emph> pound, the Lord Bishop and his compatriots were thrown into a fever of excitement. From the five barracks, which were at his Lordship's command in the interest of law and order, issued squads of police, well armed and ready for any emergency. Orderlies were constantly going to and fro between the legal and the religious authorities; from the ostentatious and gigantic preparations made, it might be imagined that the country was on the eve of one of those terrible rebellions which are always so fortunately discovered just at the right moment. On Sunday the police paraded with shouldered muskets in the vicinity of St. Patrick's, that the misguided congregation might see that the whole machinery of law and order was in requisition to compel them to keep the peace and respect the rights of property. The formidable conspirators had no need of the warning or menace. They had succeeded in their aim, and were not disposed to further "outrages" when they found that the pound was removed to another location.</p> 
               <p>But if the worthy Anglican Bishop was forced to give up his original design, he found consolation in inflicting a severe punishment for that outrageous attack on his property. The Police Tax was increased to 8<abbr>s.</abbr> 2<abbr>d.</abbr> in <emph>the pound</emph>-a frightful burden on the already overtaxed, hardworking people of that poor district. The distress occasioned by this cruel imposition of an unjust tax-the harrowing scenes witnessed when the bailiffs made their dreaded raids into<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7227-00000157"/> the poor villages, invading every house, rudely searching for some hidden store of money to satisfy the tax-gatherer, and in default thereof seizing on cow, pig, or sheep, anything that came in their way which would bring enough to pay for the breaking of Lord Woolcut's pound-would pain the coldest heart, and rouse the tamest looker-on to indignation. Yet the victims of this unworthy stroke of vengeance were expected not only to suffer all without murmuring or discontent, but to be ardent and devoted champions of <emph>the law,</emph> which in this as in a thousand similar instances, proves the ready instrument for oppressing them at the whim of every narrow-minded and-vindictive landlord.</p> 
               <p>And the world at large-the kind-hearted nineteenth century-<emph>wonders</emph> why this irrepressible Celtic nature is forever revolting in its aimless, senseless way against law and civilization. Why <emph>will</emph> unfortunate Ireland persist in meeting with suspicion, and repaying with ingratitude, every effort of the sister kingdom for her amelioration and improvement.</p> 
               <p>Alas! "The world," ready enough at sharing its abundance with the "poor Irish" when the cry of starving thousands is borne to its shuddering ear, cannot see the great original cause of all this poverty and wretchedness. It accepts the explanation sneeringly given by British philanthropy, and settles itself in the conviction that Ireland's misery springs from her obstinate adherence to tradition-tenant right traditions-agitating traditions-remedial traditions-above all, religious traditions! Here is the solution of the problem. <emph>Superstition, thriftlessness</emph> and <emph>ignorance,</emph> together with the <emph>boggy soil</emph> and <emph>wretched climate</emph>-these produce the evil, and how can can England remedy it? The priests are responsible for the first-a mysterious Providence for the last:-there is no need of further inquiry or explanation.</p> 
               <p>"England," says John Mitchell, in his quaint way, "has been left in possession not only of the soil of Ireland, with all that grows and lives thereon, but in possession of the world's ear also. She may pour into it what tale she will, and all mankind will believe her.-Any hostile comment upon her way of telling our story, is an unmannerly interruption; nay, is nothing short of an <emph>Irish howl.</emph>"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A Parting Scene.</head> 
               <p>ON a bleak March morning a little procession of men, women and children-some three-score souls in all-moved slowly and sorrowfully down the avenue from the parish priest's house towards the high road. At their head were the O'Loughlins, who after two years' heroic endurance of unaccustomed toil and privation, were now proceedin to their new home. They were all there, a touching family picture-father, mother and eight children. For, though many letters had been sent by the absent daughter and her husband, urging them "to come to America," where William would soon build them a snug log-cabin adjoining his own, never for a moment could the father entertain the thought of leaving his native land. And Mark and Frank, in the fervor of their filial piety had abandoned, for the present, at least, their scheme of emigrating; they could not take a step which would add to the affliction of their parents.</p> 
               <p>But had their destination been across the Atlantic, the grief of the family and of their neighbors-partakers in their hardships and trials-could scarcely have been more bitter. Bidding adieu to their old parish, to places endeared by a thousand fond recollections, was a sad addition to their other woes; and though hope beckoned them onward, still would memory turn regretfully to the past. No wonder then that the voice of lamentation went up from that mournful procession; that sobs broke forth from old and young, as they looked their last at the places which would know them no more-at the beloved pastor, benefactor and friend, to whom their hearts were bound by every tie of religion and gratitude.</p> 
               <p>And little less was his emotion as he gave his parting blessing, and spoke a few glowing words of affection and counsel to that faithful little band, who had so nobly repaid his pastoral love and care, in the martyr-like spirit with which they had endured humiliation, want and misery for the faith of Christ. In his own touching language, that parting scene "was heart-rending, bringing up at once to my memory all the horrors<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7227-00000159"/> rors of the three days of November, 1860, when I saw the bishop's crowbar do such deadly work, guarded and sustained by the <emph>brave</emph> arms of the Queen of England; and at the same time conjuring to my imagination all the roofless homes, and extinguished and ruined hopes, and broken hearts, and widows and orphans, and misery and dark desolation, that have been the staple of our social life within the short space of fifteen years!"</p> 
               <p>Well might the Father's eyes grow dim and his voice husky with emotion as those harrowing pictures presented themselves to his mind. But this would not do-he must not dismiss those faithful people, looking up to him with such reverential affection, in tears.</p> 
               <p>Conquering his emotion by a brave effort, he consoled them by speaking in fervid language of that beautiful bond of union, by which the church binds all her children together, however widely separated by distance; reminding them that the foot of the altar may truly be termed the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rendezvous</foreign> where all the members of her fold, whether living or dead, may meet in spirit, and sweetly feel that for them there is no real parting-no sorrowful separation. There it was, he told them, in the presence of the Divine Victim of propitiation, that he would daily give them a meeting- recommending themselves, and their temporal and eternal interests to Him whose adorable Heart is the common centre where all faithful hearts may meet; and thus, too, he desired to be most frequently remembered by them, when they knelt before the altar of the same holy faith, however distant from their old parish church, pleading for themselves and for all they held dear, well he knew that <emph>he</emph> would not be forgotten.</p> 
               <p>Having thus soothed and elevated the painful feelings of his departing children, Father Dillon proceeded to read a letter which he had received several days previously, but had kept in reserve, to dissipate, in a measure, the gloom of this hour. It was from Mr. Gillman, the worthy curate who had been so unceremoniously dismissed by the Lord Bishop, on account of his liberal sentiments. He had since then resided in England where he had unexpectedly been promoted to a "good living;" and had already sent a testimonial of his sympathy for the evicted tenants of Bartrymore. His present letter contained another donation, and what was far more welcome, the intelligence that he had become a Catholic, as had also his wife's sister, Clara Hudson, and the gentleman whom she had lately<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7227-00000160"/> married, a distinguished officer of the British Navy.</p> 
               <p>"My good wife still keeps on in the old track," wrote the ex-curate, "and is pleased now and then to give it as her firm conviction that the three important individuals above mentioned have certainly been bewitched-else they could never have deserted the dear and venerable Church of England. But when she threatens to grow too warm on this theme, I take care to supply a counter-irritant by an allusion to Lord Woolcut, which quickly turns her indignation to that quarter. Then we find ourselves carried back in fancy, to the days spent in Bartrymore; happy days, of which we would not have one unpleasant recollection, but for his Lordship's bigotry. And Emily contrasts that disagreeable characteristic, his cold manner, &amp;c., &amp;c.,-(you remember how she <emph>can</emph> run on when she gets this subject started?)-with the very opposite qualities which so greatly surprised her in a certain reverend representative of another creed. She has pleasant recollections, too, of hours passed in the society of Mrs. Brown and Miss Lynch, whom she really believes to be good and sincere Christians-<emph>Catholics though they are.</emph> But, alack! an unwelcome thought interrupts her eulogy, for we have recently learned that Miss Lynch has become a Sister of Mercy; and Emily cherishes the utmost repugnance to all religious communities, and has no patience with the Church for sanctioning such institutions. Yet I do not despair of her conversion, and what a strict, out-and-out convert she will be! For this eagerly desired blessing, I trust to your holy prayers, my dear Father, and I know that your zealous congregation will not refuse to breathe an occasional petition on her behalf to Him whom they are trying to serve in a spirit worthy of the early days of the Church. To you and to them, under God, I feel that I shall owe her conversion, as I undoubtedly do my own, since those memorable evictions first directed my attention to the subject; and when, though convinced of the truth of the Catholic religion, human respect and motives of interest would have held my soul in thrall, the thought of your faithful people, their courageous abandonment of everything at the call of duty, rebuked my weakness, and spurred me on to make the sacrifice faith required-a sacrafice how small compared with that which they have laid on the altar of God."</p> 
               <p>Well had Father Dillon judged of the effect<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7227-00000161"/> this letter would have on that little assemblage. Drooping heads were raised, tearful eyes glistened with pleasure as he read; and there was an exultant tone in the voices that uttered the various thoughts to which it gave rise. "Praise, honor, and glory be to God for all his goodness!" "Oh, He will bring <emph>her</emph> around in His own good time!" "No fear of her-sure, she had the good heart and the open hand for the poor, without asking their country or creed, and isn't it to such the blessing is promised?"</p> 
               <p>And as the little group again took up their line of march, their sorrows were almost forgotten in the enthusiasm of their feelings, and they beguiled the way by recalling pleasant recollections of the amiable family who had once inhabited "the parsonage."</p> 
               <p>Let us part with them now, while the light caught from the fervor and generosity of their natures, shines upon their gloomy pathway. They are going to their new homes! Let us hope that they may there enjoy the realization of their humble desires; that their future lot may be exempt from the bitter trials that have marked their pat; above all, that they may live to see the time when their country, freed from the iron rule of the stranger, will "assume among the nations of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle" her. Then, never till then, will an era of "prosperity" dawn on Ireland. That day may be far distant, yet she never loses faith that it will come. Impoverished, persecuted and oppressed, as no other land has ever been-"confiscated," "subjugated," but <emph>never conquered</emph>-breaking forth ever and again from the tomb in which her enemies fondly dreamed they had laid her forever, the old land-proud mother of heroes and martyrs, of saints and sages-still looks with unwavering confidence to Him whom she has long served in humility and patience, for the time of her exultation; the time when "free, sovereign and independent," she will give to the faithless nations as glorious an example of virtue and faithfulness in prosperity, as she has given during her long night of sorrow and gloom. <q>
