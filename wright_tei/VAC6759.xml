THE object of this little volume is two-fold: First, to add a drop toward swelling the tide against the use of intoxicating liquors. Scond, to furnish means for the support of one de- prived of sight since early infancy. It is hoped these objects will gain for it access to many homes. The Author would not prejudge his own work, by offering here any apology for its appearance; but hopes adverse criticism will be withheld until his story is told.

IT was at the close of day, in early fall, when we first saw  Green Bluff It was then a village of a few hundred inhabitants, lying among the hills of our adopted State. Nature had lavish ed her stores of loveliness on the whole landscape. In the centre of the town was the public square, which consisted of sev- era] acres of land, inclosed by a plain, neat fence. In this square were large oak and ash trees, placed there years before by the original settlers. Beneath these stretched the velvety sward of   <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6759-00000005"/> 10     GREEN BLUFF.        A green, relieved by the gravel walks that wound in and out among the trees, affording delightful promenades for all classes, after the toil of the day was over. On the north and south sides of this square were two large wells, situa. ted just inside the inclosure. From each of these extended a spout, leading to a huge trough outside the fence, where the farmer-traders watered their  horses, and where the lads of the village held high carnival, morning and even- ing, as they brought the, sleek, spirited steeds of the more wealthy to water. Here, too, the tired laborer, or thirsty traveler, slaked his thirst from the huge iron ladle that hung suspended by a chain from the oaken pump-without charge and without hurt. On the evening of which we write, the promenades were filled with children   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   " at play, while here and there under the trees were groups of men--laboring men-who, on their way home from work, had stopped for a draught of the clear, cold, refreshing, life-giving bever- age furnished by the great Creator for his creatures, and now were chatting cheerfully of their work, their families, and news of various kinds. They were dusty, sun-burnt and hard-handed, but beneath the dusty, brown exterior, there was true nobility. The bony hand told of days of toil for others-for wife, for children, for civilization. It was with them a badge of truest manhood, of  warmest heart and tenderest feeling. As the shadows lengthened, they parted and wended their ways homeward. Into some of their homes we afterward went, and of their beauty and real joyfulness ( we will tell by and by.    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6759-00000006"/> 12     GREEN BLUFF. Down one of the wide, quiet streets  we wandered. It led us by the ceme tery. The sexton-old, gray-haired, but buoyant in spirit, and nimble in movement-kindly received us, and pointed out the places of interest, and gave us a brief account of each. "This," he said, pointing to a tall monument of beautiful design and fine workmllanship, "marks the place where Mr. Green was buried&amp; It was put up by the mechanics. Mr. Green-(he built that school-house over yonder, where you ee the spire glittering. Just be- fore he died, he willed the whole thing, house and all, to the town, to be used for a school for the poor-this is what the mechanics-and other men, too- but the mechanics went ahead in the matter-this is what they did for him) --he had some very queer notions about r   A TEMPEAtPfIOE STORY.  13 sume things; very good notions, I think that some people think them very queer. One of his ideas was, that a man that swore or got drink, weren't fit to train up children. So, as long as he liked, he would never hit any man teach him that house that did either; and, in his will he provided that the town should give up the property, if the trus. tees elected should employ a man that 'did either. I tell you, sir, that man done more than I can tell for this place in his day. You saw the public square, did you? Well, that was some of his work. He paid for half of that ground out of his own pocket. He always  argued, that such things were great helps toward keeping men sober." "Haven't you any whisky shops in town?" "Not one, sir-not one. There nevel    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6759-00000007"/> "  MGREEN BLUFIF was. one here, and I hope never will be" "Why are you so decided in your wish that there may never be one es. tablished here It is thought by many that they are a benefit to a community --they increase the business of the place." "That may be; guess it is true: but, sir, it doesn't pay; I say, it doesn't pay at all. Just compare our neighboring towns with this. Take Middleville, for instance. It has more business, I know, but one-third of it is destroying what may be done by the rest.

They have disturbances on street every night al- most, and the Sabbath, there, is no more than any other day, to many; for   /   PA TEMPERANCE STORY.  15 there is an endless amount of street D unging, and horse-racing, and whoop. ing, and all that sort of thing. Why, last Christmas I was there on some business, and was never so ashamed of myself in all my lif9 before. I was ashamed I was a man. There was a group of drunk men every few rods on tife streets, and they were uttering all kinds of bad talk. That is not half stroke enough to put it-but, sir, it was awful  I saw several ladies compelled to go out into the mud and water, in the middle of the street, to pass the crowds on the sidewalk. All this time the half-crazed wretches excuse me, sir, I don't mean to be rough on them, but I can't call them any less-these - wretches actually clapped their hands - in delight when they saw the ladies - splashing through the mud.  Where    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6759-00000008"/> 16     GREEN BLVFF. were the officers? They were half. tipsy, too, and took care not to see the quarrels or to hear the obscene talk. That is the kind of business they have there. Such things happen every pub- lie day-at elections, and such like. No, sir, Green Bluff never had any such, times, and I hope it never will." While repeating these words, the old sexton was rapidly walking to and fro before his little cottage, to which we had come.  The tone and gestures plainly indicated how earnest he was in his protest.' After further conversation with him, in which he told of the happy, quiet Sabbaths, of the well-filled church, the attentive, neatly-attired worshipers, the Bible class that met Sabbath after- noon, of the brotherly kindness existing among the people of this beautiful vil  I!   -   A TEMPERANCE STORY    17 lage, of the thrift of all classes, we left to go to our boarding-house, or hotel. I Here we found no bar-room, no loung. ers, no smoking, swearing, gaming; but insteac there was a reading-room, well lighted, with walls ornamented, not with lewd pictures, but with beautiful landscapes, chaste ideal scenes. The guests were seated at the long table extending the whole length of the room, writing, or reading the late papers and magazines, of which there was a good supply. Thus engaged, time flew rapidly, and we were surprised when the old-fash. ioned clock on the shelf struck the hour of ten. Soon the guests were in their rooms, and sleep shut out thoughts of either the beautiful town or its happy tnhabitants. j The next day was Sabbath.

Were all the people attendants at church? No Were all temperate, or abstainers from intoxicating drinkS? No; but public opinion was so strongr against the use of whisky or wine, or any drink of like nature, that one would as soon openly steal as to become intoxicated, or even be seen using such beverages. All were not habitual attendants at church, yet this same high-toned opinion prevailed with reference to Sabbath desecration, so there was a. powerful restraining influence exerted in, that direction too. When men's minds are not beclouded by stimulants and their baser nature aroused by their influence, it is easy for the Word of God to move them toward   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   19 the right. Hence the quiet condition of 'Green Bluff The village pastors. found it easy to persuade the youth to attend Bible school and public worship, for there was no counter-influence at work. At the Bible school we found not the children only, but, as intimated the young men and ladies we e there too. We purpose not to give a full de- scription of this charming village; but only to present a brief outline of it, and let the reader fill up according to fancy,. assuring him that he can not overdraw the picture.

It was the mid. dle of the session, you know, and the time for reports. When we were all in the Seminary chapel, lIro Clarkson read the standing 'of each one in all the studies--whei he came to my name, what do you think I got?"       : "Your standing?

Oh, Walter'! Tell me all about it." "Well, it seems that Mr. Gray, the 'boss' of our mine, is going to leave soon to take charge of several mines in Pennsylvania, and some one must take his place.

And, what ia worse, they cannot do as much work1 now as formerly, and they, of course, .re los. ing in their wages daily." "Walter, tell me, my dearest, you will never touch any thing of the kind, will you?" Her arms clung closely around his neck, and, with a tear in her mild blue eye, she gazed at him earnestly, tremb- lingly. "Never, my dear. Have no fear for me. 'Well: as I was going to say, my wages will be nearly or quite double what they are now, and I will have but little work to do."

To them both it was rose-tinted. Mr. Stone, a mechanic of considerable tal- ent, had always received a good share of the patronage of the villagers. The day of which we write, he had just re- beived a job which promised him steady employment all Winter in the shop, and constant work the coming Spring and Summer. The tea was announced as ready. Tle happy family gathered around the table-spread with luxuries? No. The meal was frugal, but temptingly prepared. The bread, snowy white and light as possible; the butter, a rich golden hue, and sweet-scented; the milk, yellow with richness; the tea,  savory in the extreme; cold sliced ham and cold beefs tongue, with sauce of   i TE1JPERAN(E STORY.  29 apples, constituted the main part of the fare. Plain  Yes; but a morsel with quietness is better than rich viands amidst contentions. Vhy did the hour at the table seem so brief that evening  Was it not because each was intent on supplying every means possible to furnish pleasure for the other? As they gathered about the board, Mr. Stone remarked, "Walter tells me, mother (Mr. Stone always called his wife mother), that he has promise of prootion and increase of wages." "So Lucy says," answered his Wife. t Well, I believe he deserves both, and I am sure he will not prove himsell unworthy the trust bestowed." She looked, admiringly, lovingly at her son.

I have thought of many comforts I can furnish you, which you have not now.  And, if I can only retain that place, I hope to have enough laid by to keep you and father in your old days." Mr. and Mrs. Stone glanced at each other, and a tear might have been seen trembling in their eye as they thought of this feeling of affection in their son. He noticed nothing of thisas ne turned to his sister, and with a warmth rarely seen, he said, "As for Lucy, to-day, while lying flat on my back in the mine picking at the hard coal above me, I thought out what I would do for her. This quiet, coun- trified life is not the kind for her. She must go to school, to college. Then, if   A, TEMPERANOE STORY.   31 she wants to, she can come here and teach in our school.

"I hope so; but Walte, der, yout ar, too imaginative and sanguine. If you -do half what you propose, you would have nothing left for self." "Well, I was just saying if I had the, means I would do this. It is pleasant to think about what we would do if we could, you know." Thus they talked until the church bell warned them of the meeting for singing. Walter was made to lead,  just as some are made to follow. In the singing he was leader. Not because he was better acquainted with the science I l  ,                 ..*    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6759-00000016"/> 32     GREEN BLUFF. and art of singing, but because there was in him those traits of character that mark the natural leader. Here, too, success attended him. Having the con- fidence, we may say the love of the whole church, he exerted an influence over them that was really marvelous in one so young. The elder members yielded tp his opinion as they would to a superior. The younger portion of the church followed him as they would an older brother. When the two were gone, Mr. and Mrs. Stone drew near to the cheerfu1 fire, blazing and crackling on the hearth. "Just twenty-five years ago, my dear, since we entered' life together.

It was for thirty pieces that he betrayed his Lord. But was there no palliation for the crime? Certainly.

The well-to-do were scarcely prepared for so sudden a storm, while the poor were actually staring on account of its suddenness and severity. At Mr. Stone's, the family were gathl ered around the tea-table, and, as usual, formed a picture of perfect happiness. For several i&amp;ays, Walter had been oc- cupying his new position, and giving great satisfaction to the superintendent and proprietors.

This evening, leaning back and push- ing his plate from him, he said: "I am unesy about Colbert; he has not been to the mine for a week! I believe I will go to see him; perhaps he is sick." "I know he is," said Mr. Stone, "for to-day the minister came to me for assis- tance, to buy some wood and provision for the family. I meant to tell you before, but it slipped my mind."

So saying, he kissed mother and sister, and, buttoning his great coat close up to his neck, he started. It was a half-hour's walk that night, as the drifts had made it almost impass- able.

Throwing himself upon the lounge in   the sitting-room, near the blazing fire that Mr. Stone had built in anticipation of his son's return, he soon fell asleep, and slept soundly until two hours after- ward, when he was wakened by the pressure of lips to his own.

She looked longingly into the future, hoping that her dear boy would, in time, grow to the man she pictured in her imagination. '6 Will he?" she often asked herself. The day for the trial came at last. At an early hour the dhapel of Green Bluff Seminary was filled by anxious spectators. The competitors sat on a front seat, in full view of all, and'the centre of attraction to all. Charlie was calm and unembarrass. ed, and apparently forgetful of all sur. roundings. A seat or two from him sat his mother and sister. His mother's head was bowed, and occasionally her lips moved as if in prayer. Charlie was forgetful of all, apparently, save of this lady. Ever and 'anon he glanced that way, and seemed longing for a look from her. He felt that with the bene   diction of her eyes only he could be calm and brave-and successful; that is, he knew he could declaim every word of his selection. Judas was more careless. He glanced at every new comer, and nodded famil. iarly at acquaintances as they came in. He was a genius, and knew it. His talent as a declaimer was known by all, as he had won many laurels on similar occasions. He felt his ability, and could have no fear of failure. The hour for commencing drew near. The hall was full, and yet more came. The doorway was crowded, and many stood without, despite the cold. It was evidently a gala day for Green Bluff. The five trustees, who were also to be Judges in this, came and took their seats on the platform. Judas spoke first. A suppressed cheer \     <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6759-00000034"/> 68     GREEN BLUFF. greeted his appearance. The careless manner he wore a few minutes previous, gave place to a calm, dignified look, thlt won the hearts of many. His opening sentences fell like music upon the ear, and hushed every breath of noise. Gra. dually, but surely, he won the minds and hearts of those that listened, and carried them on, as the rapid, rushing river bears onward the leaf on its waves. He closed amidst bursts of applause. Then Charlie arose. For a moment he stood and looked over his audience, as a general views-the enemy's fortifica- tions. In many of the upturned faces he read his doom, as the incredulous smile that played over their counte- nances said, "Judas has the prize-you need not try." Glancing but a second at the seat where sat his mother, his eye met hers, and there he read such   ,j (A TEMPERANCE STORY. 6, depth of faith in his ability, that a new spirit seemed to breathe in him. Back from his white forehead his 'light locks were thrown, from his eye beamed a fire that seemed to burn the 1 eye it met. He spoke, and silence fell on all again as at first. The lad seemed more than human as he threw new life into words that often before had been declaimed from the same place. His theme was pathetic and tragic by turns, as it was a picture of a drunk- ard's doom.   He finished. Scores sat weeping, and many leaned forward, as if ldrawn by some invisible power toward the youthful speaker. No applause greeted him. The judges retired for consultation.

When quiet was restored, he said, "Charles Hayes receives the prize." Again were cheers repeated in rapid succession, while Judas, almost wild with delight, grasped the hand of his young conqueror, and, swinging his hat above his head, cheered more lustily than any, forgetting the place and tine in his joy.

THANKSGIVING day was a time as eagerly watched for as Christmas, both by young and old of Green Bluff. This year it was destined to be more than usually joyous. Arrangements had been made, by which the customary sermon was to give place to a variety of exercises in the town hall. The day dawned bright and cold. The snow covered the earth and man- tled every tree and shrub, glistening in the sunlight but refusing to disappear beneath his warm rays. From the mansion of the wealthy and the cot of the humble but noble day blaborer, parents and children hastened to the place of assembly. The clergy, lU    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6759-00000036"/> 72     GREEN BLUFF. town-officers, and the speakers of the day, occupied the platform. In front of them the Sabbath Schools were seated. A more lovely scene can scarcely be imagined than that of scores of children, neatly, tastefully,' comfortably clad, gathered togetLer to praise the Great God in song. Back of these were the older people-the mechanic and 1ier. chant, the collier and banker, side by side in the social gathering, as they of necessity must be in the business world. Most conspicuous among the speakers for the day, was Dr. John Thomas. His manner was prepossessing in' the ex. treme. High and broad his forehead, dark and keen his eye, and musical his voice, he could not fail to attract atten- tion wherever he appeared. The programme called for prayer,   A TEMPERANCE STORY.    73 songs, recitations and orations. For three hours the audience remained in. tensely interested, and ln nothing more than in the Doctor's speech, which aDounded in flashes of wit and strains of eloquence. Unusually gifted, edu- cation had made him   an attractive speaker as well as an accomplished phy- sician. His gifts and accomplishments were the more striking from the youth- ful appearance he bore. As night lav2e been expected, the youthful victor of the preceding day was called to repeat his declamation. His appearance was greeted by such applause as would well-nigh turn the lead of a much older person. At the close, the oldest clergyman present gave a brief statement of the condition of the little village. He said, "Where, my friends, in the whole    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6759-00000037"/> 74     GREEN BLUFF. extent of the United States, is there a Community of people who have more to be thankful for, than we have-? Very meet is it, that we, as a community, should assemble here, to-day, to give expression of our gratitude to God for His manifold mercies. Where shall we begin to enumerate them, or where shall we leave off? Verily, they are past numbering. Yet I cannot refrain from presenting a few o the benefits which we enjoy above malnyof our neighbor- ing villages. "How pleasant our situation! Nes. tled here among the hills, sheltered alike from the fierce blasts of Winter and the burning heats of Summer, bordering the clear waters of our own beautiful river, we can boast of naturlfi loveliness and pleasantness of situation, above any town of our state. And it seems right   A TEMPERANCE STORY    75 that so happy a people should have such beautiful surroundings. "But it is not the surroundings that make us happy.    It is a trite saying, ' 'Be virtuous, and you will be happy' yet it finds an illustration in out community, and hence its force. Will you listen while we tell of our virtue as a town; tell of it by pointing to its effects? "Seldom, this past year, very seldom, has the deep tones of the church bell told in measured notes of the presence of the dark-winged miessenger, Death. There are few graves in our cemetery on which the grass has not grown--few, I say-and verily believe it would be true to say, none. "Who of you have seen ragged chil- dren, or hungry women, walking our streets, begging a pittance to keep soul    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6759-00000038"/> 76     GREEN BLUFF. and body together?  True, it is, that we have had occasion to open olu hearts and purses to supply the want of some one or two of our worthy la- borers, upon whom sickness had come suddenly-but such cases are rare. "Walk on our streets after night-fall, on Sabbath eve, when nearly all of our ,people are gathered into the churches, and be astonished to see the windows of our houses left unfastened, and doors unlocked--yea, even open in the Sum- ner time!  Does that argue anything in behalf of the honesty of our people? I tell you, friends, it-speaks volumes.

I do no one any wrong, and am flat- tering no one, when I say, that, to-day, there have been, on this platform, pupils of that School which would do honor to any town or city in our great domain.

No; for its his- tory is written, never to be effaced I hope, in the commodious, well-filled stores, the mills and manufactories, I  and mines of our vicinity.

AFTER the events narrated in the last ,chapter had transpired, the people of, Green Bluff separated to go to their homes, and partake of the bounties pre- I ': pared beforehand. I?  At Mr. Stone's there were unusual preparations made. The snowy cloth seemed to glisten with unwonted bright. i ness. The few pieces of silver (gifts from Walter to his mother) could not be burnished more carefully, while the arrangement of the various dishes on the table, was almost perfect. It was Lucy's deft hands that accomplished  these changes. Mrs. Stone's motherly face wore its,    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6759-00000040"/> (0     GREENT BLUFF. isual smile of contentment and love, and  ler husband never seemed more com.  j Pletely at ease with himself and all the rest of mankind. Walter was in the highest spirits, and overflowed with wit and repartee. Lucy was more quiet than  ordinary, yet there was something in her look and manner that told of more than ordinary joy. Despite herself, blushes came and went in rapid-succession as  (hey discussed the meeting from which they had just come.  "It was the very best Thanksgiving meeting I ever saw," said Walter,  bringing his hand down on the table with an emphatic thump.   "Didn't  Charlie Hayes do splendidly? and what a perfect model speech was that of Dr. Thomas'!"  Lucy's eyes fell--bat she was silent "All was very good. I should think   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   81 r.

Did you receive my last letter?"              i "Not Until yesterday--the very day you came, I wondered why you didn't write. It was miscarried some way."  A gentle rap at the parlor door. "Come, father," said Lucy.      I Mr. Stone entered, and advancing to the doctor, said-- "I come to congratulate you for my-I self, and for Mrs. Stone, on the speech I to-day. I hope it may prove to be only the forerunner of continued success. God bless you!" A warm, hearty pressure  of the hand, followed this benediction. The doctor bowed low in token of his appreciation of the blessing.    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6759-00000043"/> 86     GREEN BLUFF. "I will not intrude further," said the father, turning to leave, "for, no doubt, you and Lucy will have all too little time to talk over old scenes and pleas. ures; yet it seems that you might have written all you had to say in the nu- merous letters that came. How many was it, Lucy? seven a week? Well, good night." "Bless his dear old soul," said Lucy, as the door closed behind him. "One thing is certain, John--you may repent of your selection for a wife; but a nobler, truer, kinder father-in-law, you could never have found."

Some time before the hour for work to begin, Colbert came, and stepped into the office to leave his dinner-bucket and to remove his heavy coat. "Good morning, Colbert; hope you had a pleasant time yesterday. Glad, to see you back, ready for work. It has been some time since you were here." "Yes; I have had a hard time of it. Everything seems 'gainst a poor man, these days. Kind 'o thought for a time I would be laid. up all Winter." "But you weren't laid up all Winter, so be encouraged. How are the fam- ily " Walter motioned him to a seat, *   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   89 and, sitting near, put his hand on his shoulder kindly, and said, "C olbert, I am getting uneasy about you. DIo you know why?" "Course not. How should I a" "Don't you think you go too often to Middleville?" "Why, no; guess a fellow has a right to go where he please, and as often as he please, in this land." This he said rather pettishly, and arose and walked the floor of the office, ' Don't know so well about that, Col- bert. You have no right to go into my trunk and take my clothing." "What do you mean?" He stopped shortN  front of the speaker, and gazed at him inquiringly. 'I mean that you have no right to go where you please, if in so doing you injure another. To make it plainer:    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6759-00000045"/> 90     GREEN BLUFF. You have no right to walk into your neighbor's garden in the Spring, when seeds sown by him are just sprouting, and trample the life out of them, so he and his family are deprived of any of their food." "I don't understand what that has to do with my going to Middleville." ' You don't? Well, my friend, let me be still more plain. Now do not be offended at me. Every cent you spend for liquor at Middleville, takes that much food or clothing from your fam. ily. Now, have you the right to rob them of what is theirs, any nle than you have to rob me of my prpertyJ? Not so much. You have promised to love and cherish your wife; but, in- stead, you are preparing to bring misery upon her." So said Walter. "Guess my family is not suffering."   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   91 This Was said in a churlish tone, while Colbert sat down with his back to Wal. ter, and moodily thumped with his foot against the floor. "They are not suffering?  Why, man, what would they have done two or three weeks ago, if the town had not bought wood and provision for them?" "Well, a fellow can't help getting sick-can he " "Not always; but, you could have helped that. If it had not been for that tramp over to Middleville, you could have been at work these last two weeks -yes three weeks. But, as it is, you have lost twenty-five or thirty dollars, besides having to pay a doctor's bill of some ten or twelve dollars. Making a total loss of nearly forty dollars, just by one spree." "Well, a fellow must have some-    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6759-00000046"/> 92     GREENI BLUFF. thing to cheer him up, occasionally. He can't live always down in these mines without something to help him." "Something to cheer him up? Does it cheer you up, to know that you have lost forty dollars? Do you feel more like work now than you did before you were sick?"  Colbert did not know how to answer these questions, without condemning himself, so he was silent. Finally, he said, "I believe a fellow could do more work if he had a dram every morning; for about noon I feel, kind o' sick and faint, and can't half work until I get a drink from some of the men." "Your belief amounts to nothing, when your experience furnishes such  strong proof to the contrary. Why do you feel sick and faint about noon? Is it the appetite you have created, calling   A TEMPERANCE STORY.    93 out to be satisfieda Of course. You used dig as much coal as any man here; but, now, you are far behind Jones. How is it? Why, it is plain to any one. You have lost real strength since you began your dram-drinking. It is true with reference to all the other men who drink." "I1 hardly  ever drink  whisky: I l don't like the taste of it, really. The most I ever drink, is beer There can be no harm in beer." "It invariably creates an appetite for some thing stronger. There is where the great mischief is. But it is false that beer is beneficial in the long run. It may make you stronger for a time, but its effects pass off and leave the system weaker than before any was taken. Your own experience teaches this. If it wasn't so, why do you feel    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6759-00000047"/> "    GREEN BLUFF. so faint and sick about the time its effects have passed away?" "Oh, well, you needn't be afraid of me  I will never become a common drunkard. I will never abuse my wife. Why, I love my family as well as any man. If I ever do take a little too much, I go right home. I never will be found on the streets drunk." "So you may think, now; but the time will soon come that you cannot say your family is not disgraced. Every drunkard that ever lived, thought just as you do now. I tell you, sir, there is but little difference between the beer drinker, or tippler, and the common drunkard. About the same, as I once heard, as that between a pig and a hog -it is only a question of time." "Why, I know there's no danger in me ever becoming a gutter-man-I could quit to-day, if I thought it hurt me."   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   95 "If you can quit to-day, as you say you can,"--here Walter arose and put one arm around the neck of his friend, and kindly, almost affectionately, said-- "quit! in the name of all that is pure and good, quit! for your family's sake,' QUIT! Can. you bear the thought of seeing your little girls exposed to the taunts of their schoolmates, because their father is a drunkard? Think of them. Colbert. In the name of your soul's best ipterests, I beg of you to QUIT! Remember the warning of your God --No  drunkard shall enter the kingdom of God! This may be the last time I will ever speak to you thus; but I must, once again, beg you to beware of the awfult danger into whirh you are running! There is the waisile! we must go to work." So saying, he turn- ed and left Colbert, who hastened Edwni to his place in the mine.    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6759-00000048"/> 6     GREEN BLUFF.        I That afternoon, as both were on their way home, Colbert walked up by the side of Walter, and in a tremulous tone said: "'Bos,' I have heard those words of yours ringin' in my ears all day. God knows I love my wife. She has been a noble woman, sure. Don't think me a brute, 'bos.' I do love my little ones--bless their hearts! I tell you what I am going to do-I am going to quit!" "What's that you say !" said Walter, excitedly, grasping the weeping man by the hand; what's that! say that again, my man, while I say, 'Amen,' to it." "I am going to quit beer, cider, whis. ky, and every thing of the kind; and here is my hand en it," said Colbert, earnestly, at the same time pressing Walter's hand in his own bony fingers as if in a vise.    A TEMPERANCE STORY.   97 "Amen!" said Walter. "Your wife does not yet know that you have been drinking. She has thought that you were sick. May she never know it! The future begins to look cheery again. Remember, Colbert, total abstinence is the only safe course. No man can take fire into his bosom and not be burned. Do you see i" "I see," he said. The next morning the road from Col- bert's house to the mine echoed songs of gladness that he sang-snatches of sacred songs learned at church--songs of praise, songs of prayer. He was determined to keep his pledge. "Here, old fellow, come this way a minute," said one of his comrades beck- oning around the corner of the super- intendent's office. "I have the best ' Old Rye you ever tasted. Take a littlo,    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6759-00000049"/> 98     GREEN BLUFF. for your stomach's sake. See how it sparkles! What you standin' there for  Come, I say, and take a little. I haven't, forgot that you treated last." "Thank you," said Colbert; "I guess I can get along without it, to-day." "Nonsense, nonsense, man. You look pale and weak-like. This will give you strength and ruddy cheeks." "No: I have decided not to drink any more." "You have, ehl? We will see how long you keep your pledge. 'Spect Stone has been lecturing you-hasn't he?--and you are afraid to be a nan, and do as you please, el?" This was followed by a derisive laugh. Colbert advanced, and took the bottle in his hand. He loo1ked at it a mlomlent, and then handed it back, say. ing--"No, I will not drink this morn   A TEMPERANOE STORY.    99 Ing." He turned to leave, but his com- rade grasped his arm and held him fast. "Here, Colbert, 'don't be a baby, to be led around by other people's opin- ions. Drink, man! drink!" Here he removed the cork, and held the fatal bottle near Colbert's face. He inhaled the fumes-he grasped the bot. tle, and, closing his eyes, as if to shut out some horrid picture, he quaffed the poison, and laughed at his former fears. Before night came, the effects of the liquor began to pass away--and then came a raging thirst for more, and bit- ter remorse because his vow had been broken. He now began to see how firm the tyrant held him. He had, before, thought himself master of his appetite; but now he felt that he was a plaything in its hands. He stopped his work several times,    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6759-00000050"/> 100     GREEN BLUFF. being lost in reverie} At times, he felt as if he was rapidly descending a steep hill, at the foot of which was a pit, dark, deep and dreadful, into which he must descend, as there was nothing to stay his downward course, but every thing to accelerate it. In imagination, he felt himself on the very verge of the gulf, and made one desperate effort to avoid the last fatal plunge. This wak. ened him from the reverie. "O God! save me!" burst from his lips. There he again renewed  his pledge, with God as his witness, and until late in the evening worked hard to recover what he had lost by his dreamy stupor. He went home, a sadder, but a wiser man.   A TEMPERANCE STORY   101 CHAPTER IX: WIN'rR has passed.   Many have been the changes in Green Bluff. The railroad, long in contemplation, has been completed as far as this village. To put a bridge across the river here, required no little time and not a few men. The majority of the workmen were strangers. They brouglht their in- temperate habits with them.! Attracted by the natural beauty of Green Bluff, as well as its convenience to their work and cheap living, they purchased or rented houses and became bona fide citizens of the place. Spring election of town-officers is over. Three new councilmen are elect-    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6759-00000051"/> 102    GREEN BLUFF. ed. Two of the former Board are re elected. Since the incorporation of the village there has been an ordinance in force fixing the rate to be paid for license to sell liquor so high, that no one ever for a moment entertained the thought that  any one would apply for a license, for had the application been granted (which was next to impossible, on account of  the stern temperance principles of the community and of the councilmen usu- ally elected)--had the application been granted, the fee would have consumed all the profits and dipped deep into the capital of the dealer. The first meeting of the new Board  passed off without any unusual occur- rence. The second meeting was not so fortunate. Of its doings we have to speak in this chapter. P   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   103 "Is there any other business to come before this Board to-night?" said the chairman, pushing aside the papers before him on the desl removing his glasses, and preparing to adjourn the Board. "There is, sir." So said Mr. Templeton, one of the new members, rising to his feet, and bowing patronizingly io the chair. The chairman looked at him in sur. prise, as he had been silent nearly all the evening during the session of the Board, w-hile the other imembers leaned for- warld to catch the words of the speaker, who seemed somewhat embarrassed. "' I move yol, sir," he continued, " that this Board grant James Snow, when le shall have complied with the re- . quirements of the ordinance, license to sell liquor, as a beverage, in this town."    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6759-00000052"/> 104    GREEN BLUFF, Trembling with excitement which this bold step had caused, he sat down, wip. ing great drops of perspiration from his brow, and glancing anxiously at Mr. Furtherton, another new member, who hesitated 'a moment, and then arose, saying, "I second the motion.' Had an earthquake shaken the room in which they were assembled, the chairman and the two old members could not have been more astonished and alarmed, One of them, Mr. Stone, sprang to his feet, and forgetting parliamentary usage and order, said: "I move he don't." "Order, gentlemen!" said the chair. man, recovering from his surprise, yet agitated greatly. "We surely have nothing to fear from this motion. Let the subject be thoroughly discussed, and I am persuaded the mover will see his mistake and withdraw his motion."   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   105 "Not much, he won't," said Temple ton, in an undertone. The chairman then said:  "It is moved and seconded, gentle. men, that this Board  grant James Snow--when he shall have complied with the requirements of the ordi- nance-license to sell liquor as a bever- age in this town. Are you ready for the question?" "No, sir!" said Mr. Stone, rising. "We hope never to be ready to vote on that question in this Board. It is a disgrace to the hitherto. fair name of our loved town, that such a motion should ji  ever be made. I can scarcely believe i my ears. I can account for the course pursued by the mover on no grounds whatever.

I do not deny it: I am glad of it. I hope never to get to a point where I will not  be excited, when such a proposition is made.

That has  nothing to do with this motion." "It has very much to do with it, sir Proceed, Mr. Stone," said the chairman "I was going to say that, however much I love my children, I would rath- er follow them to the grave, to-day, than to see them  made intemperate and die drunkards. If they die now, I believe that in the bright' hereafter I will see them again. If they fill, a drunkard's grave, '1ll never see them any more.

The glasses he wore more for effect than utility.

Mr. Newcome then arose, and said. in his dry, yet clear and practical style:  "Mr. Wise said we could ornament  our cemetery with the proceeds of this  traffic, and could beautify our square.

THE next afternoon, true to promise,  Snow had his sign swingingn in fronit of his door-"Sullnny Side Saloon," was  roughly sketched upon it. The house was small and poorly furnished, situ- ated in an out-of-the-way place, yet suf- ficiently conspicuous to attract the at-  tention of those desiring any of the goods he had for sale. The news of this saloon's existence caused no little consternation in Green Bluff. It was the subject for discussion  in every store-room. and at every work. shop in the town. Many and bitter  denunciations were heaped upon the proprietor, and his accomplices, Wise, Templeton, and Furtherton; but they %,   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   123 availed naught-the mischief was done. For one year at least it must remain a fountain of corruption in the com- munity. Few were the customers that Snow had until after nightfall. After dark- ness came, his little room was well filled by men and lboys. Some came to see; some to buy. The proprietor was in  exuberant spirits. He was shrewd. Beer and ale and whisky were dealt out with great fieedom, and almost without cost. Hei knew that an appetite, once created, knew lo bounds scarcely, hence his de- sire to have all present take a little. Toward the hour of nine he mounted I  a bench and began a harangue. "My friends, I have never ben much at speech making, but I must tell you, to-night, that James Snow knows as    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6759-00000062"/> 124     GREEN BLUFF.  well as any one how to mix up first-rate dhrinks, an' that right chape. I mean  to kape no low house--no, sirOee. Mine  is to be a respect'ble house. I'm your  friend. I know you git tired of your  shops and homes sometimes, and want to  be free for a little while. Ye's want to be free--to do as ye like. To sleep if you like, and to dhrink if you like. Come, then, to my house-to my Sunny  Side-an' you'll al'us find James at home, an' a hearty welcome to you. Corie, now, my boys, let's have a good old dhrink all 'round?" " So saying, he took his place behind the counter, and dealt out the beer as fast as called for. His speech and treat  was received somewhat indifferently by most present; a few persons, however, cheered him by promises of patronage. When they were gone, he sat musing   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   125 on the prospect before him. it was not as flattering as he desired or expected. Suddenly starting up, he hurried to his money box, saying half aloud, "And shure I 'most forgot to reck'n up my 'arnings. Purty slim show, now, in- deed, seeing an' thare's a whole keg of beer gone already! Well, never mind, now. We will get it all back, I -guess, before meny days." Snow was not of the lowest class. His appearance was somewhat attrac- tive. Brought up without any religious training at all, he knew but little about moral obligations, and cared less. His object was to keep out of the clutches of the law, and make all he could by any means whatever. His shrewd na- ture told him that there was money in the liquor traffic to the dealer, even if it did bankrupt the buyer. What did he i    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6759-00000063"/> 1U     GREENX BLUFF. care for that? To use his own language --when upbraided by some citizens for opening his saloon--  "An' it is nothin' to me, gintlemen, i if men do spend all their 'arnings at my  shop. Let them see to that. If it is wrong to sell beer an' such like, why did your good people license me to do it,  now, an' I'd like to know?

And shure I will."      I In vain they remonstrated. He had the law on his side and felt safe.    A TEMPERANCE STORY.   127 saw the force of his argument, that he hai a legal right to sell as long as the  legislature or town council granted a license, thus recognizing his wholesale  murder as a legitimate business. Before the week was out, Snow found he had quite a good run of custom, as  he had all the men .who were work- ing on the bridge and many of the mi- ners who formerly had gone to Middle.  ' ville for beer. The latter class visited  his saloon only at night. The other  class were more bold, and openly went:  for their dram.  Snow was a good violinist, at least so thought the boys of Green Bluff, and he was not long in discovering their ,  liking for such music. Nightly, they would gather in the vicinity of his shop  to listen to the music. They did not  often venture inside. He did not urge     <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6759-00000064"/> 128     GREEN BLUFF. them to do so. He knew it was not wise i to do so. "Ah, James," said Wise, on the Mon- day morning following the opening of his shop, "you got a sound drubbing yesterday." "Indeed, your honor, you're mistaken, shure. Never has James Snow ever ben drubbed, an' surely not yisterday." "Yes, you were, James, but I sup- pose you didn't feel it-but, perhaps, you will." "And what is it you mean?" "Why I understand all of the parsons in town let loose 'all their thunder and lightning against your little shop. They are going to make it hot for you, James. Can you stand it?" "I'll give 'em back as hot as they send, now you see if I don't." "That's right, James; stand your   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   129 ground: but you will have a hard fight.

"An' what's that you say?   I4ep cl'are sellin' to boys as come around my shop? No, sir.  I pay my license to sell, an' I sell. I sell to man, woman, or children, just all the same. If it is not right to sell to the boys, it is not rigt to sell to the mien. If it be right to sell to the men, it is right to sell to boys." "But, James, you mustn't forget, your friends. You see it is getting rather warm for me here, because everybody says I was the cause of your opening this thing, and they are doing all they can to hurt my business." "And shure I don't see that at all. Didn't the  other men  help out I? Didn't Tempultun and Furdertun vote with you?" "Yes: but, you see, I did all the talking and wire-working." \   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   131 "And didn't James Snow pay you for it?" "Yes." "Then what are you growlin' 'bout imr forgettin' his friends for?" Wise was somewhat alarmed at'Snow's attitude, as he was working for popular favor. Having made all he could out of him, he sought now to get back to his old place in public opinion. That night Snow began to lay plans for thwarting the designs of the pastors and Sunday-school superintendents of Green Bluff. A legion of devils seemed to have taken possession of him. He aimed at the brightest marks in the town.    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6759-00000066"/> 132     GREEN BLUFF. CHAPTER XI. SPRING had gone, and Summer was waning fast. Sunny Side Saloon was increasing in business, and its keeper becoming more bold and unscrupulous in his workings for patronage. Thus far, the evil effects of the saloon were seen only in the loungers who gath- ered on the st;eet corners and stood around the door of Snow's establislment. The fear that existed in the hearts of some was passing away. Pastors and church officials, teachers and parents, were less active in their warfare against the traffic-in their warnirngs were less constant and earnest.  Not so with Snow. HHe remembered and cherished the vow to ruin the strongest of the   I?:l   A TEMPERANOE STORY.   133 1 emperance band that had been formed. To do this, was no small task. He felt himself aggrieved in that the town had granted him license to sell, and yet permitted, even encouraged, systematic opposition to his business. He wanted revenge, and was determined to have it : -but these thoughts he kept in his !?? own heart. 'j  Charlie Hayes was not a boy whose pride ruled his judgment; yet he was in no way deficient in the former. The flattering remarks of his friends did; much toward increasing his stock of self-esteem. That was natural. After a time it became apparent that he loved to hear his name spoken in connection with "best declaimer," "fine gestures," 8  "perfect grace of manner." That be- came his weak point. Who of us have not our weaknesses I    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6759-00000067"/> 134     GREEN BLUFF. "And I just was telling these men, that they never heard the like of you inl speakin'," said Snow to Charlie, one  afternoon, as he was passing his shop.  "You flatter me," said Charlie, bow- ing and passing on. - "Not a bit of it. Jest you step in here and let these gintlemen hear you." "And we will be pl'ased if you will," said one of Snow's " gintlemen," rising and bowing profoundly.        :,. "Indeed, we will, said a half-dozen  others in chorus. All who happened  to be then present were of Snow's   K kind. "But I am afraid I would not please you if I should.

"It requires that you go not into the way of the destroyer.'  "Unless to rescue some friend," said Pride and Ambition, together.      i "It is useless to try to save these men -so long have they been slaves to their  appetites," said Conscience, "so do not place yourself in danger when there is no hope of success." These  thoughts passed  rapidly through his mind as he stood half undecided.  "Come right in, men; he will spake to us, I know."    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6759-00000068"/> 136     GREEN BLUFF. They all followed Snow  into the saloon and ranged themselves around the room, while Charlie took his place on a bench set out for him. He spoke, but with little ease to himself. When he had finished, all were loud in their praise. Some declared they never would'drink another drop. Unsuspect- ing, Charlie did not ntice that their pledges of abstinence were ironical. He hastened home, pleased with his afternoon's work. B t could he tell his mother  "No," he aid to himself; "I must not. She is so peculiar about my going near such places, it will only frighten her. I won't tell any one. I wish I hadn't gone in. Wonder if those men were in earnest? If they only were! Pshaw! how foolish to think I ould move them from the wrong." "An' shure, I didn't belave he'd bite I   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   137 so easy. Just be easy, men; things move all right. The ice is broke, he's been in.

BYou hlave him shure, James. And you may count on us to help you." Charite's amblitious spirit would not let him remain idle during the vacation months. During this time he usually made such progrless in his studies as to gain a full term on his class. This close application told on his health. The ruddy glow faded from his cheek, and the sparkle. passed from his eye, unless excited by reading or conversation.

Snow noticed the change, too. "Charlie, your as thin as a shade,  and as pale as the moon; your not sick now?" he said one day, as he. met him on the street, reaching out his hand, and giving Charlie a hearty clasp. "Not sick, but very tired." "Tired? And what have you ben doig?"  "Nothing but reading, and such like." 1 "And does your bones ache, and is  your feet and hands cold, and head hot?" "Just exactly," said Charlie, interested.  "How do you know so well how I feel?"  "Ah! my boy, I know," said Snow, with a knowing shake of the head. And I know what'll set you up all right."

"Well, my remedy may not suit you --but it's good an' shure." "What is it?" "A And it's nothin' but London porter." "Oh! I can't take that!" said Char- lie, quickly.

You can try it, an' if it isn't as I  say, you needn't buy any more. That's all."  Charlie went home and told his mother all about the conversation with Snow. At first she refused to let him take the presclribedd reedyl ; but finally concludet d it avs her duty, as a mother, to do all she could to preserve her son's health, and consented to his receiving the ale and using it. How much better and safer it would have been for her to have removed the cause of Charlie 's   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   141 poor health, by putting aside his books and forcing him out into the fresh air, instead of allowing the cause to remain, and trying to counteract the effect by another opposite cause. That night Snow stopped and left the bottle of ale at Mrs. Hayes', and expressed great concern for the health  of her boy. His kindness touched a tender chord, and she felt that he had  been traduced by many. "He is not such a hard hearted man, after all," she said to Charlie, as she was afterward talking the matter over with him. "I iffered to pay for the bottle of ale, but he refused, and said he would be paid if you could only get well and stout again.'. She looked ad- miringly at her boy, who lay stretched on the 'sofa, thin and haggard.

If she had only remembered the com- mand to avoid every appearance of evil --but she did not. True to Snow's word, Charlie djd feel better after drinking the ale a day or two. He came to the table with a renewed appetite. Some of the old lustre came back to his eyes; some of  the buoyancy of spirit returned. With  these came a love for the remedy. At  first it was disagreeable to the taste-- now it was pleasant. He sought it for every symptom of pain. It generally proved efficient. Weekly he visited Snow's to get a new supply.

He was regularly at church, and watched the speaker with fixed atten. tion; but his thoughts were not of God -they looked not so high. In the quiet of the sanctuary he planned his busi. ness. From the house of worship he went home thoughtfully- but the text he pondered was money. "I will stay in this city, and get 4ain," he said contin-. ually to himself. Was he a Christian? He thought so. He gave of his earthly substance to the support of the Gospel; he prayed when called on in public- prayed the same prayer always; he prayed at night before retiring--he could not shake off this habit of his earlier years. He was interrupted in his walk and reverie by the entrance of a neatly at- tired man, who accosted him with- "Mr. Thomas, I believe. Jones, is my name."   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   147 "Be seated, Mr. Jones."  "I understand, Mr. Thomas, you have a store-room, on Main street, un occupied, which you desire to rent." "Just so, sir; do you wish to rent it?" "I do, if we can make satisfactory terms." "My price is seemingly high; but I will rent for no less. I can get that by. and-by, if not now. I want forty dol lars per month, always in advance."'. Jones raised his eyes in astonish ment. After a few other words, with. out affecting a reduction, he agreed to take the room. "What is your business?" queried Mr. Thomas.        "I desire to open a respectable bil. liard saloon, sir, with a genteel bar in connection with it," he replied blandly.

He took the money and nervously tucked it away in his purse. His conscience lashed him as it never had before. "It is not my fault. I didn't know what his business was." He said to himself. "It is your fault. You did know what his business is, before 'you ever touched the money," said Conscience. "I can't help it now." "You can help it.

JONES was not dilatory in opening his billiard-hall. True, it was as he said he understood his business. A musical instrument, which played a variety of tunes in a most charming manner, was purchased, and immediately installed. A passer-by, hearing the sweet sounds within, would imagine that a brass band of the greatest skill was the cause. At other times, when the instrument was changed, he would suppose an orchestra, -composed of organ, piano, flute, violin, bass viol, and cornet, rendered the nlusic. It requires no strong imagination to conceive the influence this combination of curious mechanism and sweet sound   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   153 would have upon the youth of Green Bluff. As the simple music of Snow's violin and vocal powers lured them near to his den, so the exquisite strains of Jones' establishment tempted them to a seat within its odoors. Once within, they could not resist the temptation to stay and witness the sharp contest between expert billiard players, that had been brought to the place by Jones as a bait for the unsophisticated. To what lengths will the emissaries of Satan go to accomplish the death of; a single soul! How slow are Christians to use the means at hand for -hwarting tht designs of these Satanic agents. Jnes, himself, was attractive in man. ner. He spared no pains to ingratiate himself into the good graces of the young, especially-but of the old, too. He was too wary to denounce, out.           i    <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6759-00000077"/> 154     GREEN BLUFF. right, their prejudices in favor of strict temperance principles. Indeed, he was an advocate of temperance himself, he said; as he claimed, that any man could control his appetite, if he would, and need not drink to excess. He would frequently say to the group of young men and boys gathered in his saloon: "Why, I'm as much opposed to in. temperance as Parson Gibson, every bit. I never get drunk and roll in the streets. I would be mortified beyond measure, if I should ever so far forget my dignity as to do that. But, then, I see no harm in a. social glass, now and then--indeed, I think, it is good for one's health. Besides, one can't go in. to respectable society, if he don't drink a little wine, or gin, or something of that kind-that is, in a town of any size. Oh, you can, here, to be sure--   A. TEMPERANCE STORY.  155 but, then, you can't by-and-by. Things are changing, even here. I wouldn't sign any temperance pledge. Ha! ha! ha! The idea is absurd! Ha! ha! Why, my manhood is enough pledge for me. It is an old fogy notin, that we mustn't have any pleasure in this world. I say, let every man do as he pleases. If any of you, young men, want to come here, and have a good social game at billiards, and then a glass of beer, or wine, or gin--why, I say, your fathers are old fools, if they say any thing against it. You'd better be here, learn- ing something of the world, than at home moping over an old book, or play- ing servant to your mother or sister. - Besides, there's time enough, by-and- by, boys, to settle down and be old folks --but, now, while you have no wife or children hanging to you, you'd better be    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6759-00000078"/> 156     GREEN BLUFF. having a good time, for you can't have any after that. I go in for temperance -of course, I do: but not for absti nence. No, sir." Thus, this oily-tongued, nicely-attired man, spread broad-cast his ideas of right and wrong, and sowed seeds of disobe- dience to parents, and tempted the youth into his clutches. More than one home in Green Bluff felt the effect of his baleful influence. The once-dutiful lad became restive un- der parental restraint. The studious, quiet, loving brother, changed into the listless, noisy, impatient boy. Where once was an unbroken family circle around the fire-place, or gathered about the social board, there was one or more empty seats.

The sales of the two liquor establish- mnents were immense, and their profits large. This was evidenced by the cost. liness of their furniture and the extrav agance of their proprietors. Snow removed his saloon from  the   by-street, where he had first opened it, to a commodious room   on Main street, that he might successfully com- pete with his formidable rival. His apartment was but little less attractive than the latter    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6759-00000079"/> 158     GREEN BLUFF. If these two men could grow rich by this traffic, why not others? Certainly, that was a correct and sensible ques- tion, and received an affirmative answer from several other men as unscrupulous as to the means of obtaining wealth as were Jones aud Snow. Not many months elapsea after Jones was estab- lished, before Green Bluff had the mor- tification of reading among her other signs over store doors, those of "Sunny Side Saloon," "Jones' Billiard Hall," "Quiet Retreat," "The Poor Man's Rest," and "The Anchor House." These all sprang up as in a night. Whence they came, none could scarcely tell. That they all lived, was a contin- ual wonder to some. "Where do they get their support?" was often asked, but seldom received a satisfactory an. s8wer.   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   159 One day, as a miner was returning home from work, he stopped in front of Snow's "Sunny Side," and looked admiringly at the beautiful sign that swung in the breeze, over his door, and gazed at the nicely-painted windows -(saloons always have their windows painted, and a screen before the door-- they are those who love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are eviD -through which, however, he could see the glow of the red-hot stove.

He looked at Snow, behind the counter, arrayed in a clean white shirt, clean apron, blue pants, and blacked boots, and thought him his best friend. He wondered at the goodness of the man that would provide all these comforts for him, a poor, hard-worked miner. He was as- tonished at the condescension of the man that would let him come into his house, and, although black with the dirt of the mine, permit him to sit by his fire, or stretch himself upon a bench and rest. As he gazed at Snow, the author of his present happiness,   A TEMPERANOE STORY.   161 he loved him in his heart, and felt no task too hard to perform for him. Rising from his chair, brimful of kind feelings, excited by his thoughts just mentioned, he approached the counter, and grasping Snow's hand in his own black, bony one, he said: "Ah, James, I'm glad you have fitted up 'Sunny Ride' so comfortably. You may look for me here every night, sure. How could you afford it, though?" "I can afford any thing for such cus- tomers as you. Don't I know what you like?" "Indeed, you do, James, and you shall never be the loser by it. I spend as much more, sometimes, every week, for liquor, than I do for my whole fam- ily, clothing and all." Just so, poor, blinded man! Here is the secret!

CHAPTER XIV. THE time for the election of new councilmen came again. The advocates of anti-license, depending upon 'the strength of their principles, put forth no extra effort, and, indeed, met the op. position with no organization, and con- sequently no concert of action. The re. sult was as might have been predicted from such carelessness--the license par- ty gained the day, again electing three out of five councilmen. There was high glee in the various saloons when the vote was announced. The temperance party were chagrined and grieved beyond measure. Another year, at least, of ruin was before them. The experience of the past year de   ' TEMPERANCE STORY    165 monstrated the fact, that the police force must be increased. Hitherto, one mar shal was sufficient to keep order. Now, they found it necessary to employ three policemen besides the marshal. Two of these were on duty during the day, and two during the night. The salary of each policeman was three hundred and fifty dollars, and that of the marshal five hundred, to which was added a fee of one dollar for every arrest of disorderly person and fine for every detection of violation of town regulations by saloon keepers. The economy of the license plan now became apparent. It was not difficult for any one to calculate how un- wise, in a-mioney point of view, was the license scheme. Five saloons, at seven- ty-five dollars each, brought into the city treasury three hundred and seventy-five dollars, while the salaries of the mar-   <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6759-00000083"/> 166    GREEN BLUFF. shal and policemen amounted to fifteen hundred and fifty dollars, leaving a clear loss to the town of eleven hundred and seventy-five dollars, besides the amount paid out for arresta and detection of irregularities of the dealers in liquor, which amounted to one or two hundred each year. To this, add the fees of city attorney and police magistrate, and you have another hundred, which makes a total loss of nearly fifteen hundred dollars. These facts appeared in the report of the treasurer, made public after the election. Had they been known before, the result might have been different. They were not known. The result was not different. The quiet of the town suffered. It was just after midnight, in early spring, when the bells rang out the alarm of   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   167 fire. From every house rushed men and boys, gazing this and that way to discover the place of the fire. The hook and ladder company were soon at their room, and had, their car, heavily laden with ropes, ladders, buckets, axes, hooks, &amp;c., under way, drawn by a score or more men roused fromn their slum- bers. To the surprise of every one, flames lighted up the windows and cupola of the school building. Intensest indignation swayed the hearts of all as they almost flew along the streets to rescue this precious piece of property from destruction. What could equal their anger, to find the alarm caused by a pile of burning boxes and barrels in the yard, ignited by a lct of drunken boys, who had also broken into the church towers to ring the bells to give the alarm. Thankful, indeed, were all, , t      <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6759-00000084"/> 168     GREEN BLUFF. that it was a false alarm, and yet great was their anger at the depravity of the ruffians that had done the deed. "Why didn't the night watch dis. cover the actors?" Why? When Spring had fully come and flow ers were dotting the yards and filling the air with perfume, when the early vegetables were ripening for use, fur- nishing many poor families with a de. lightful change from the unvarying diet of Winter, the spirit of Satanic mischief was let lose to enter the hearts of the saloon loungers, so that the sun rose to light up broken, dying rose bushes, marred flower beds and trampled gar- dens, as gates from barn-yards and gar. dens had been unhinged and hid away or thrown wide open, permitting cows and hogs to enter and devour and destroy.

Not that he has lost any of his boyish buoy ancy of spirit. His eye sparkles as bright as ever, and his step ih no less light, but firmer. The real nobility of his character is rapidly developing it- self. His face betokens thought. His conversation shows culture.

He has influence wherever he goes. His learning is not extensive, but is thorough and practical.  His nights have been spent with his books, when they were not occupied with deeds of love, such as visiting the sick frmi. lies of his men. His refinement is the effect of his reading, observation, and practice in the home circle. His moth- er, regarded as a queen--as, she is to him-and his sister as a princess.

"Just as I expected," and he gave his knife a harder thump. "I saw all this the night a vote was taken on the li- cense of Patterson. When I think of the mischief that man and Jones have done, I can scarcely contain myself. It is murder-deliberate, malicious, murder-in Charlie Hayes' case. I was told, to-day, that Snow had been boast- ing over his victory. It is awful!" "It is awful, father," said Walter, "but let us hope for the best.

"Perhaps not; but that does not makl Snow's crime any the less, nor does it excuse those men who voted for his license. God's wrath is said to slumber, I believe; but it will surely wake up, and then where will these men stand!" "Colbert is on the decline, too," said Walter.  He is not at the mine more than five days out of each week. I have talked with him, and tried to show him his danger. Sometimes he is penitent and weeps like a child, and promises to reform, but in less than a week he is down again. He did do better for awhile, before the saloons were opened.

"If he should propose to use the room for a hospital for the cure of yellow fever or small-pox, I think he would refuse to let it, and the town would rise up, en masse, to prevent his letting it for such a purpose." "So they would, and justly, too. As it is, he has rented it for a purpose far more dangerous to the moral health of the community than is small-pox to the physical.

"It is hot so terrible, my sister, to think about danger ahead, and avoid it, as it is to endure its pangs.

Choking sobs rose, but she pressed them back, and brushed the tears from her eyes, and persuaded her. self that it was foolish to weep over imaginary evils. Despite her efforts, though, thoughts of the doctor as a common drunkard, brought tears and choking grief again and again.

"Nothing but cloves," Jones replied, and dared not show his disgust for the ungentlemanly act of the doctor. "All right, then-here we go for Stone's."

"Certainly, my dearest, anything you would know." The doctor summoned all his wits and strength to talk straight and soberly: "Pardon me, if I wrong you, but"-- She could go no further, but sat down, weeping. "Speak freely, dear, whatever you have to say. You trouble me so," and a look of pain crossed his face.

The wife of a genteel tippler is in a fair way to become the wife of a drunkard. No girl should ever receive the attentions of a man that has so far forgotten his manhood as to barter it for momentary pleasure. If he cares not enough for her love, now, to refrain for her sake, he will be less likely to do so after marriage. When the tendrils of woman's affec- tion twine about a congenial spirit, it is like death to break them loose; but if the object of her affection is an inebriate, she must prepare to suffer death itself if she unites her fortunes to his.

What a sad face was hers! the tear-stain yet on it; the color all gone; voice trembling with emotion; frame shaking with fear and smothered anger. She pushed open the door. The keep. er looked up amazed. The loungers leered from their red eyes. She no- ticed none, but gazed anxiously around the room. A cry of pain, scarcely audi. ble, burst from her lips.

It was her husband, the father of the little boy and girl that clung to the woman. Oh! the agony of that wife's heart. She spoke not a word-she could not; her grief mounted up like great stones in her throat, and prevented utterance. Taking him by the arm, she lifted him to his feet, and, bearing part of his weight, led him to the door--out of it-and helped him into the wagon, after repeat- ed efforts in vain on his part.

The next day she was to leave for school, to be absent for a whole year. She had seen but little of the doctor this vacation. His practice was large, he said, and lhe could not tarry long when he did call, and his calls were less frequent than formerly. She knew nothing of the dreadful habit fastening itself upon him. She was anxious for a long, fare. well visit to-night. There was so much   A TEMPERANCE STORY.  205 to talk about. She started at every form she saw turning the corner and coming toward her-thinking each time it was her loved one. Minutes length- ened into an hour.

He was on the outside of the gate; she on the inside, leaning over it, and pressing her head against his. His eyes were averted. A slight chill ran through his frame. "You are cold, dear.

When I entered the barber-shop, under Miller's store, I found a well-dressed, intelligent-looking. young man, stretched out on the bench, dead drunk.  Occasionally he would rouse up, and utter profane words, :  glare wildly about the room, and then lie down again, slobbering, and moan. ing, and cursing."

His idol was cast down. The God he had so long served in mockery, appeared to him as a vengeful being. He found no pleasure in his service. He saw that he had brought the wrath upon his own head.

One of the company, in mock reverence, raised his eyes to heaven and insulted the Holy Spirit, by asking His blessing upon them. Pouring out the gin, he passed a glass to each of his companions, and, taking one himself, he broke a piece of cake, and placed it in their mouth, and then commanded them to drink, in the name of Jesus , I   A TEMPERANCE STORY.   217 Christ, the Son of God; after which he prayed in earnestness foi a descent of the Holy Spirit, while his companions responded in loud Amens and Hallelu- jahs.

Her experience in suffering, has deepened the already full stream of sympathy in her heart, and has intensi- fled her hatred for the accursed traffic. Her life will be light and shade com- mingled. Her joy will be the purest and deepest; her griefs softened by the pres. ence of one noble, true heart-- James Gibson-son of her beloved pastor, who is himself a young minister, with all the ardor of his father, and with his deep, abiding enmity, to the demon-Drink.

God's grace, is the only true safeguard against the attacks of the devil. Green Bluff, as a city, exists, a mourn ful example of the ruinous effects of licensed crime. Her streets are in need of repairs. Her treasury is empty, and the city in debt. With a police force, she fails to preserve order, as her Sabbaths are desecrated with impunity. With her faithful and able ministers, she fails to rescue the youth from sin, as there are three saloons for every church and a score of temptations to go astray for every warning and induce. ment to follow virtue. Her beautiful park is no more a place of quiet resort. Its beauty is marred. Weeds growing rank, have succeeded the clean, velvety sward.
