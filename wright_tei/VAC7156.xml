            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO the generous friends who so kindly entertained "Aunt Kitty," I venture now to
               present in "Aunt Nancy" another of the single sisterhood, who will be found, I trust,
               not less deserving their indulgence. Like "Aunt Kitty," she has sought to render
               amusement subservient to instruction, and she hopes that those who receive her as a
               Christmas Guest will find in her something more than an entertaining companion.</p>
            <p>From the examples she will present to them, they may learn that to the brave and true
               and faithful heart, "all things are possible"—that he who clings to the good and the
               holy amidst temptation and trial, will find peace and light within him, though all
               without be storm and darkness; and that in a right understanding and unfaltering
               performance of duty—not in the pomps<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7156-00000006"/> and
               pleasures of a self-indulgent life—lie our true glory and happiness.</p>
            <p>It may be proper to state that some of the tales related by "Aunt Nancy" are here
               re-printed with slight alterations, from the papers and magazines in which they first
               appeared several years ago. To the editors of such papers and magazines I would here
               tender my thanks, for the courtesy with which they supplied me with copies.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>THE largest and the most picturesque country house of all I know in America is the
                  mansion house of my friends, the Donaldsons. I would gladly inform the reader of
                  its locality, but this Col. Donaldson has positively prohibited, for a reason too
                  flattering to my self-love to be resisted.</p>
               <p>"You know, my dear Madam,"—I give his own words, by which I hope the courteous
                  reader will understand that I am really too modest even to seem to adopt the
                  flattering sentiment they convey—"You know, my dear Madam, that your description
                  will be read by every body who is any body, and that through it my simple home
                  will become classic ground. If I permit you to direct the tourist tribe to it, I
                  shall be pestered out of my life when summer comes, by travelling artists,
                  would-be poets, and romantic young ladies."</p>
               <p>I may not therefore, dear reader, tell you whether this pleasant abode be washed
                  by the waves of the Atlantic or by the turbid<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC7156-00000007"/> current of the Mississippi; whether it be fanned by
                  the flower-laden zephyrs of the South, or by the health-inspiring breezes of the
                  North. The exterior must indeed have been left wholly to your imagination, had I
                  not fortunately obtained a sketch from a young friend, an <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >amateur</foreign> artist, of whom I shall have more to say presently. As I
                  could not in honor present you with even this poor substitute, as I trust you will
                  consider it, for my word-painting, without Col. Donaldson's consent, I have been
                  compelled in deference to his wish, to divest the picture of every thing that
                  would mark the geographical position of the place represented. The shape of its
                  noble old trees we have been permitted to retain; but their foliage we have been
                  obliged to render so indistinctly, that even Linnæus himself would find it
                  impossible to decide whether it belonged to the elm of the North when clothed in
                  all its summer luxuriance, or to the gigantic live-oak of the South. Even of the
                  house itself we have been permitted to give but a rear view, lest the more marked
                  features of the landscape in front should hint of its whereabouts. As to the
                  figures which appear in the foreground of the picture, they are but figments of my
                  young artist friend's imagination. One of them you may observe carries under the
                  arm a sheaf of wheat, not a stalk of which I assure you ever grew on the Donaldson
                  lands.</p>
               <p>Even from this imperfect picture of the exterior, you will perceive that the house
                  is, as I have said, both large and picturesque. Within, the rooms go rambling
                  about in such a strange fashion, that an unaccustomed guest attempting to make his
                  way without a guide to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chambre de nuit</foreign> in
                  which he had slept but the last night, would be very apt to find himself in the
                  condition of a certain bird celebrated in nursery rhymes as wandering,<q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>Up stairs and down stairs</l>
                        <l>And in the ladies' chambers.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In this house have the Donaldsons lived and died for nearly two hundred years, and
                  during all that time they have never failed to observe the Christmas with right
                  genuine, old English hospitality. Then, their sons and their daughters, their
                  men-servants and their maid-servants, and the stranger within their gates, felt
                  the genial influence of their gratitude to Him who added year after year almost
                  unbroken temporal prosperity to the priceless gift commemorated by that festival.
                  At many of these festivals it has been my good fortune to be present. Indeed,
                  though only "AUNT Nancy," by that courtesy which so often accords to the single
                  sisterhood some endearing title, as a consolation, I presume, for the more
                  honorable one of MRS. which their good or evil fortune has denied them, I have
                  been ever received at Donaldson manor as at my own familiar home; nor was it
                  matter of surprise to myself or to our mutual friends, when the Col. and Mrs.
                  Donaldson named their fourth daughter after me, modifying the old-fashioned Nancy,
                  however, into its more agreeable synonyme of Annie.</p>
               <p>This daughter has been, of course, my peculiar pet. In truth, however, she has
                  been scarcely less the peculiar pet of father and mother, brothers and sisters,
                  friends and neighbors—sweet Annie Donaldson, as all unite in calling her, and
                  certainly a sweeter, fresher bud of beauty never opened to the light than my
                  name-child. And yet, reader, it may be that could I stamp her portrait on my page,
                  you would exclaim at my taste, and declare there was no beauty in it. I will even
                  acknowledge that you may be right, and that there is nothing artistically
                  beautiful in the dark-gray eyes, the clear and healthy yet not dazzlingly fair<pb
                     n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7156-00000008"/> complexion, the straight though glossy
                  dark-brown hair, and the form, rounded and buoyant, but neither tall enough to be
                  dignified nor <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petite</foreign> enough to be fairy-like.
                  But sure I am that you could not know the spirit, gentle and playful yet lofty and
                  earnest, which looks out from her eyes and speaks in her clear, silvery tones and
                  graceful gestures, without feeling that Annie Donaldson is beautiful. Nor am I
                  alone in this opinion. My friend Mr. Arlington fully agrees with me, as you would
                  be convinced if you could see the admiring expression with which he gazes on her.
                  As this gentlemen cannot plead the Colonel's reason for any reserve respecting his
                  place of residence, I shall not hesitate to inform the reader that he is a young
                  lawyer of New York, who has preserved, amidst much study and some business, the
                  natural taste necessary to the enjoyment of country scenes and country sports.
                  During those weeks of summer when New York is deserted, alike by the wearied man
                  of business and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennuyé</foreign> idler, Mr. Arlington,
                  instead of rushing with the last to the overcrowded hotels of Saratoga and
                  Newport, takes his gun and dog, his pencil and sketch-book, and with an agreeable
                  companion, or, if this may not be, some choice books, as a resource against a
                  rainy day, he goes to some wild spot—the wilder the better—where he roves at will
                  from point to point of interest and beauty, and spends his time in reading,
                  sketching, and—alas for human imperfection!—shooting. These vagrant habits first
                  brought him into the neighborhood of Donaldson Manor, and he had for two
                  successive summers hunted with the Colonel and sketched with the young ladies,
                  when he was invited to join their Christmas party in 18—. Here I was introduced to
                  him, and in a few days we were the best friends in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arlington's sketch-book, of which I have already spoken, served to elicit one
                  of our points of sympathy. Bound down by the iron chain of necessity to that point
                  of space occupied by my own land, and that point of time filled by my own life,
                  yet with a heart longing for acquaintance with the beautiful distant and the noble
                  past, I have ever loved the creations of that art which furnished food to these
                  longings; and as my fortune has denied me the possession of fine
                     <emph>paintings,</emph> I have become somewhat noted in my own little circle
                  for my collection of fine engravings. Many of these have peculiar charms for me,
                  from their association, fancied or real, with some place or person that does
                  interest or has interested me. In the leisure of a solitary life, it has amused me
                  to append to these engravings a description of the scenes or a narrative of the
                  incidents which they suggested to my mind, and for their association with which I
                  particularly valued them. Annie was well aware of the existence of these
                  descriptions and narratives, and, with a pretty despotism which she often
                  exercises over those she loves, she insisted that I should surrender them to her
                  for the gratification of the assembled party. One condition only was I permitted
                  to make in this surrender, and this was, that Mr. Arlington should also bring
                  forth his portfolio for inspection, and should describe the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">locale</foreign> of the scenes sketched, or relate the
                  circumstances under which the sketches were made. A pretty <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >ruse</foreign> this, my gentle Annie, by which you furnished the artist with
                  an opportunity to display to others the talents which had charmed yourself. In
                  accordance with this compact, the scenes here preserved and the narratives
                  accompanying them were produced, and received with such approbation, that by the
                  same sweet tyranny which drew them from their hiding-places, we have been ordered
                  to send this Christmas Guest to bear them to other homes, with the hope that they
                  may give equal pleasure to their inmates.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>MERRILY blazed the wood fire in the huge old chimney of the large parlor in which
                  we were accustomed to assemble in the evening, at Donaldson Manor, and its light
                  was thrown upon faces bright with good-humored merriment, yet not without some
                  touch of deeper and more earnest feeling. That party would of itself have made an
                  interesting picture. There was Col. Donaldson, tall, gaunt, his figure slightly
                  bent yet evincing no feebleness, his curling snow-white locks, his broad bald
                  forehead, and shaggy brows overhanging eyes beaming with kindness. Beside him sat
                  Mrs. Donaldson, still beautiful in her green old age. Her face was usually pale,
                  yet her clear complexion, and the bright eyes that looked out from beneath the
                  rich Valenciennes border of her cap, redeemed it from the appearance of ill
                  health. Her form, stately yet inclining to <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >embonpoint,</foreign> was shown to advantage by the soft folds of the rich and
                  glossy satin dress which ordinarily, at mid-day, took the place in summer of her
                  cambric morning-dress, and in winter of her cashmere <foreign xml:lang="FRA">robe
                     de chambre.</foreign> Mrs. Donaldson has a piece of fancy netting which she
                  reserves for her evening work, because, she says, it does not make much demand
                  upon her eyes. This the mischievous and privileged Annie calls "Penelope's "Web,"
                  declaring, that whatever is done on it in the evening is undone the next morning.
                  Around the table, on which the brightest lights were placed for the convenience of
                  those who would read or sew, clustered the two married daughters of the house—who
                  always return to their "<emph>home,</emph>" as they still continue to call
                  Donaldson Manor, for the Christmas holidays—Annie, Mr. Arlington, and myself. Miss
                  Donaldson, the eldest daughter of my worthy friends, is the housekeeper of the
                  family, and usually sits quietly beside her mother, somewhat fatigued probably by
                  the active employments of her day. The two sons of Col. Donaldson, the elder of
                  whom is only twenty-three, his sons-in-law, and his grandson, Robert Dudley, a
                  fine lad of twelve, give animation to the scene by moving hither and thither, now
                  joining our group at the table, now discussing in a corner the amusements of
                  to-morrow, and now entertaining us with a graphic account of to-day's adventures,
                  of the sleighs upset, or the skating-matches won.</p>
               <p>Such was the party assembled little more than a week before Christmas the last
                  year, when Annie called upon Mr. Arlington and myself to redeem the pledges we had
                  given, and surrender our port-folios to her. Some slight contention arose between
                  us on the question who should first contribute to the entertainment of the
                  company, Mr. Arlington exclaiming "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Place aux
                     Dames,</foreign>" and I contending that there was great want of chivalry in
                  thus putting a woman into the front of the battle. This little dispute was
                  terminated by the proposal that Annie having been blindfolded to secure impartial
                  justice, the two port-folios should be placed on the table, and she should choose,
                  not only from which of them our entertainment should be drawn, but the very
                  subject that should furnish it. Mr. Arlington vehemently applauded this proposal,
                  and then urged that he must himself tie the handkerchief, as no one else, he
                  feared, would make it an<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7156-00000010"/> effectual blind.
                  Annie submitted to his demand, though she professed to feel great indignation at
                  his implied doubt of her honesty. No one else, we believe, would have taken so
                  much time for the disposal of this screen, or been so careful in the arrangement
                  of the bands of hair over which, or through which, the handkerchief was passed;
                  and the touch of no other hand, perhaps, would have called up so bright a color to
                  the cheeks, and even to the brow, of our sweet Annie. When permitted to exercise
                  her office, Annie, to my great pleasure, without an instant's hesitation, while a
                  mischievous little smile played at the corners of her mouth, placed her hand on
                  Mr. Arlington's port-folio, and drew from it a paper, which, on being exhibited,
                  was found to contain the pencilled outline of many heads grouped together in
                  various positions, some being apparently elevated considerably above the
                  others.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Miss Annie!" exclaimed Mr. Arlington, with considerable satisfaction apparent
                  in his voice and manner, "you must try again, and I think I must trouble you,
                  ladies, for another handkerchief. This seems to me to have been scarcely thick
                  enough."</p>
               <p>"I appeal to the company," cried Annie, "whether this is in accordance with Mr.
                  Arlington's engagement. Was he not to accept any thing I should draw from his
                  port-folio as the foundation of his sketch?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye," was responded from every part of the room.</p>
               <p>"But pray, my good friends," persisted Mr. Arlington, "observe the impossibility
                  of compliance with your demand. How can I possibly hope to entertain you by any
                  thing based upon that memento of an idle hour in court, which I should long ago
                  have destroyed, had I not fancied that I could detect in those sketchy
                  outlines—those mere profiles—very accurate likenesses of the heads for which they
                  were taken?"</p>
               <p>"Those heads look as if they might have histories attached to them," said Annie,
                  as she bent to examine them more narrowly.</p>
               <p>"Histories indeed they have," said Mr. Arlington.</p>
               <p>"Give them to us," suggested Col. Donaldson.</p>
               <p>"You have them already. These are all men whose histories are as well known to the
                  public as to their own families. There is the elder K——, at once so simple in
                  heart, and so acute in mind. Cannot you read both in his face? There is his son;
                  and there is D. B. O——, and O. H——, and G——, and J——. What can I tell you of any
                  of them that you do not know already?"</p>
               <p>"Who are these?" asked Annie, pointing to two heads, placed somewhat aloof from
                  the rest, and near each other. "That older face is so benevolent in its
                  expression, and the younger has so noble a physiognomy, and looks with such
                  reverence on his companion, that I am persuaded they have a history beyond that
                  which belongs to the world. Is it not so?"</p>
               <p>"It is. Those are Mr. Cavendish and Herbert Latimer. They have a history, and I
                  will give it you if you desire it, though, thus impromptu, I must do it very
                  imperfectly I fear."</p>
               <p>"No apologies," said Col. Donaldson. "Begin, and do your best; no one can do
                  more."</p>
               <p>"Than <emph>my</emph> best," said Mr. Arlington, with a smile, "thank you. My
                  narrative will have at least one recommendation—truth—as I have received its
                  incidents from Latimer himself."</p>
               <p>Without farther preliminary, Mr. Arlington commenced the relation of the following
                  circumstances, which he has since written<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7156-00000011"/>
                  out, by Annie's request, at somewhat greater length for insertion here, giving it
                  the title of</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Main Chance.</head>
                  <p>HERBERT LATIMER was only twenty when, having passed the usual examination, he
                     was admitted, by a special act of the legislative assembly of his native State,
                     to practise at her bar. Young as he was, he had already experienced some of the
                     severest vicissitudes of life. His father had been a bold, and for many years a
                     successful merchant, and the young Herbert, his only child, had been born and
                     nurtured in the lap of wealth and luxury. He was but sixteen—a boy—but a boy
                     full of the noble aspirations and lofty hopes that make manhood honorable, when
                     his father died. Mr. Latimer's last illness had been probably rendered fatal by
                     the intense anxiety of mind he endured while awaiting intelligence of the
                     result of a mercantile operation, on which, contrary to the cautious habits of
                     his earlier years, he had risked well nigh all he possessed. He did not live to
                     learn that it had completely failed, and that his wife and child were left with
                     what would have seemed to him the merest pittance for their support.</p>
                  <p>The character and talents of young Latimer were well known to his father's
                     friends, and more than one among them offered him a clerkship on what could not
                     but be considered as very advantageous terms. To these offers Herbert listened
                     with painful indecision. For himself, he would have suffered cheerfully any
                     privation, rather than relinquish the career which his inclinations had
                     prompted, and with which were connected all his glowing visions of the
                     future—but his mother—had he a right to refuse what would enable her to
                     preserve all her accustomed elegancies and indulgences?</p>
                  <p>"You must be aware, Master Latimer," said he who had made him the most liberal
                     offers, and who saw him hesitating on their acceptance, "you must be aware that
                     only my friendship for your father could induce me to offer such terms to so
                     young a man, however capable. Three hundred dollars this year, five hundred the
                     next, if you give satisfaction in the performance of your duties, a thousand
                     dollars after that till you are of age, and then a share in business equal to
                     one-fourth of its profits—these are terms, sir, which I would offer to no one
                     else. Your father was a friend to me, sir, and I would be a friend to his
                     son."</p>
                  <p>"I feel your kindness and liberality, sir."</p>
                  <p>"And yet you hesitate."</p>
                  <p>"Will you permit me, sir, to ask till to-morrow for consideration? I must
                     consult my mother."</p>
                  <p>"That is right, young man; that is right. She knows something of life, and
                     will, I doubt not, advise you to close with so unexceptionable an offer."</p>
                  <p>"Whatever she may advise, sir, be assured I will do."</p>
                  <p>"I have no doubt then, sir, that I shall see you to-morrow prepared to take
                     your place in my store. Good morning."</p>
                  <p>Assuming as cheerful an air as he could, Herbert went from this interview to
                     his mother's sitting-room. Mrs. Latimer raised her eyes to his as he entered,
                     and reading with a mother's quick perception the disturbance of his mind, she
                     asked in a tone of alarm—"What is the matter, Herbert?"</p>
                  <p>"Only a very pleasant matter, mother," said Herbert with forced cheerfulness,
                     which he endeavored to preserve while relating the offer he had just
                     received.</p>
                  <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7156-00000012"/>
                  <p>"And would you relinquish the study of the law, Herbert?" inquired Mrs.
                     Latimer.</p>
                  <p>"Not if I could help it, mother; but you know Mr. Woodleigh told you that five
                     hundred a year was the utmost that he could hope to save for you. If I study
                     law it must be several years before I can add any thing to this sum—I may even
                     be compelled——" The features of Herbert worked, tears rushed to his eyes, and
                     he turned away, unable to speak the thought that distressed him.</p>
                  <p>"You speak of what can be saved for <emph>me,</emph> Herbert—of what
                        <emph>you</emph> may be compelled to do. Do you suppose that we can have
                     separate interests in this question?—are not your hopes my hopes—will not your
                     success, your triumph, be mine too? The only consideration for us, it seems to
                     me, is whether the profession you have chosen and the prospects open to you in
                     it, are worth some present sacrifice."</p>
                  <p>"They are worth every sacrifice on my part—but you, mother——"</p>
                  <p>"Have no separate interest from my child—I have shared all your hopes, all your
                     aspirations, Herbert, and it would cost me less to live on bread and water, to
                     dress coarsely, and lodge hardly for the next five years, than to yield my
                     anticipations of your future success."</p>
                  <p>Others had felt <emph>for</emph> Herbert, and had offered to aid him, and he
                     had turned from them with a deeper sense of his need and diminished confidence
                     in his own powers—his mother felt <emph>with</emph> him, and he was cheered and
                     strengthened. The offers of the friendly merchant were gratefully declined. By
                     the sale of her jewels, Mrs. Latimer obtained the sum necessary to meet the
                     expenses incident to her son's first entrance on his professional studies. She
                     then appropriated three hundred dollars of their little income to his support
                     in the city, and withdrew herself to the country, where, she said, the
                     remaining two hundred would supply all her wants. When Herbert would have
                     remonstrated against these arrangements, she reminded him that they were
                     intended to accomplish her own wishes no less than his. He ceased to
                     remonstrate, but he did what was better—he acted—and the very first year, by
                     self-denying economy and industry, he was enabled to return to her fifty
                     dollars of the amount she had allotted to him. The second year he did better,
                     and the third year Mrs. Latimer was able to return to the city and board at the
                     same house with her son. It was only by the joy she expressed at their reunion
                     that Herbert learned how painful the separation had been to her. She would not
                     waste his strength and her own in vain lamentation over a necessary evil. Four
                     years sufficed to prepare Herbert Latimer for his profession, and through the
                     influence of some of his mother's early friends, exerted at her earnest
                     request, the legislative act which permitted his entrance on its duties, was
                     passed. The knowledge of his circumstances had excited a warm interest for him
                     in many minds, and those who heard his name, for the first time, when he stood
                     before them for examination, could not but feel prepossessed in favor of the
                     youth, on whose bold brow deep and lofty thoughts had left their impress, and
                     in whose grave, earnest eyes the spirit seer might have read the history of a
                     life of endurance and silent struggle. All were interested in him—all evinced
                     that interest by gentle courtesy of manner—and almost all seemed desirous to
                     make his examination as light as possible—all save one—one usually as
                     remarkable for his indulgence to young aspirants, as for the legal acumen and
                        extensive<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7156-00000013"/> knowledge, which had won
                     for him a large share of the profits and honors of his profession. His
                     associates now wondered to find him so rigidly exact in his trial of young
                     Latimer's acquirements.</p>
                  <p>"You were very severe on our young tyro to-day," said a brother lawyer, and one
                     on whom early association and similarity of pursuits, rather than of tastes,
                     had conferred the privileges of a friend to Mr. Cavendish, as they walked
                     together from the court-house.</p>
                  <p>"I saw that he did not need indulgence; and I gave him an opportunity of
                     proving to others that he did not—but I had another and more selfish reason for
                     my rigid test of his powers."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cavendish spoke smilingly, and his friend was emboldened to ask—"And pray
                     what selfish motive could you have for it?"</p>
                  <p>"I wished to see whether he would suit me as a partner."</p>
                  <p>"A partner!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—when a man has lived for half a century, he begins to think that he may
                     possibly grow old one of those days, and I would provide myself with a young
                     partner, who may take the laboring oar in my business when age compels me to
                     lay it aside."</p>
                  <p>"All that may do very well—I have some thought of doing the same myself; but I
                     shall look out for a young man who is well connected. Connections do a great
                     deal for us, you know, and we must always have an eye to the main chance."</p>
                  <p>"I agree with you, but we should probably differ about what constitutes the
                     main chance."</p>
                  <p>"There surely can be no difference about that; it means with every one the one
                     thing needful."</p>
                  <p>"And what is, in your opinion, the one thing needful?"</p>
                  <p>"Why this to be sure," and Mr. Duffield drew his purse from his pocket, and
                     shook it playfully.</p>
                  <p>"A somewhat different use of the term from that which the Bible makes," said
                     Mr. Cavendish.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! let the Bible alone, and let me hear what you think of it."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, I cannot let the Bible alone if I tell you my own opinions, for
                     from the Bible I learned them."</p>
                  <p>"It seems an odd book, I must say, to consult for a law of partnerships."</p>
                  <p>"Had you a better acquaintance with it, Duffield, you would learn that its
                     principles apply to all the relations of life. The difference between us is,
                     that when you estimate man's chief object, or as you call it, his 'main
                     chance,' you take only the present into view, you leave out of sight altogether
                     the interminable future, with its higher hopes and deeper interests, and
                     relations of immeasurably greater importance."</p>
                  <p>"I find it enough for one poor brain to calculate for the present."</p>
                  <p>"A great deal too much you will find it, if you leave out of your sum so
                     important an item as the relations of that present to the future. Depend on it,
                     Duffield, that he makes the most for this life, as well as for the next, of his
                     timer, his talents, and his wealth, who uses them as God's steward, for the
                     happiness of his fellow-creatures, as well as for his own."</p>
                  <p>"And so, for the happiness of your fellow-creatures, you are going to give away
                     half of the best practice in the State."</p>
                  <p>"I am going to do no such thing. In the first place, I did not tell you that I
                     was going to offer young Latimer an equal division of the profits of my
                     practice; and for what I may offer<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7156-00000014"/> him
                     I have already taken care to ascertain that he can return a full equivalent.
                     His talents only need a vantage-ground on which to act, and I rejoice to be
                     able to give him that of which my own early experience taught me to value."</p>
                  <p>"Well—we shall see ten years hence how your rule and mine work. I think I shall
                     offer a partnership to young Conway—he is already rising in his profession, and
                     is connected with some of our wealthiest families."</p>
                  <p>"Very well—we will see."</p>
                  <p>Herbert Latimer had nerved himself to endure five, or it might be ten more
                     years of profitless toil, ere he should gain a position which would make his
                     talents available for more than the mere essentials of existence. Let those who
                     have looked on so dreary a prospect—who have buckled on their armor for such a
                     combat, judge of the grateful emotion with which he received the generous
                     proposal of Mr. Cavendish. This proposal, while it gave him at once an
                     opportunity for the exercise of his powers, secured to him for the first year
                     one-fifth, for the two following years one-fourth, and after that, if neither
                     partner chose to withdraw from the connection, one-half of the profits of a
                     business, the receipts from which had for several years averaged over ten
                     thousand dollars. Mr. Cavendish soon found that he had done well to trust to
                     the gratitude of his young partner for inducing the most active exercise of his
                     powers. Stimulated by the desire to prove himself not unworthy of such
                     kindness, and to secure his generous friend from any loss, Herbert never
                     overlooked aught that could advance the interests, nor grew weary of any task
                     that could lighten the toil of Mr. Cavendish.</p>
                  <p>"Herbert, you really make me ashamed of myself, you are so constantly busy that
                     I seem idle in comparison," said Mr. Cavendish dish, as he prepared one day to
                     lay by his papers and leave the office at three o'clock. "Pray, put away those
                     musty books, and bring Mrs. Latimer to dine with us—this is a fête day with us.
                     My daughter, who has been for two months with her uncle and aunt in Washington,
                     has returned, and I want to introduce her to Mrs. Latimer."</p>
                  <p>"My mother will come to you with pleasure, I am sure."</p>
                  <p>"And you?"</p>
                  <p>"Will come too, if I possibly can. You dine at five?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—and remember punctuality is the soul of dinner as well as of business. So
                     do not let the charms of Coke upon Lyttleton make you forget that fair ladies
                     and hungry gentlemen are expecting you." Mr. Cavendish closed the door with a
                     smiling face, and Herbert Latimer turned for another hour to his books and
                     papers. At a quarter before five he stood with his mother in the drawing-room
                     of Mr. Cavendish, and received his first introduction to one who soon became
                     the star of his life.</p>
                  <p>Mary Cavendish was not beautiful—far less could the word pretty have been
                     applied to her—but she was lovely. All that we most love in woman, all pure and
                     peaceful thoughts, all sweet and gentle affections, seemed to beam from her
                     eyes, or to sit throned upon her fair and open brow. She had enjoyed all the
                     advantages, as it is termed, of a fashionable education, but the influences of
                     her home had been more powerful than those of her school, and she remained what
                     nature had made her—a warm-hearted, truthful, generous, and gentle girl—too
                     ingenuous for the pretty affectations, too generous for the heartless
                     coquetries which too often teach us that the <emph>accomplished</emph> young
                     lady has sacrificed, for her external refinement, qualities of a nobler stamp
                     and more delicate beauty. The only daughter among several<pb n="26-27"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000015"/> children, she was an idol in her home, and every
                     movement of her life seemed impelled by the desire to repay the wealth of
                     affection that was lavished upon her. It was impossible to see such a being
                     daily in the intimacy of her home associations—the sphere in which her gentle
                     spirit shone most brightly—without loving her; and Herbert soon felt that he
                     loved her, yet he added in his thoughts "in all honor," and to him it would
                     have seemed little honorable to attempt to win this priceless treasure from him
                     to whose generosity he owed his place in her circle. Mrs. Latimer, though she
                     did not fear for her son's honor, trembled for his future peace as she marked
                     the sadness which often stole over him, after spending an hour in the society
                     of this lovely girl; but Mrs. Latimer was a wise woman—she knew that speech is
                     to such emotions often as the lighted match to a magazine, and she kept
                     silence.</p>
                  <p>For almost a year after his introduction, Herbert continued in daily
                     intercourse with Mary Cavendish to drink fresh draughts of love, yet so
                     carefully did he guard his manner, that no suspicion of his warmer emotions
                     threw a shadow over her friendship, or checked the frankness with which she
                     unveiled to him the rich treasures of her mind and heart. It was in the autumn
                     succeeding their first acquaintance that Mr. and Mrs. Cavendish issued cards
                     for a large party at their house. It would be too gay a scene for the quiet
                     taste of Mrs. Latimer, but Herbert would be there, and at the request of Mrs.
                     Cavendish he promised to come early. The promise was kept. He arrived half an
                     hour at least before any other guest, bringing with him a bouquet of rare and
                     beautiful flowers for Mary. As he entered the hall he heard a slight scream
                     from the parlor beside whose open door he stood. The scream was in a voice to
                     whose lightest est tone his heart responded, and in an instant, he was beside
                     Mary Cavendish, had clasped her in his arms, and pressing her closely to his
                     person, was endeavoring to extinguish with his hands the flames that enveloped
                     her. The evening was cold: there was a fire in the grate, before which Mary
                     stood arranging some flowers on the mantel-piece, when the door was opened for
                     him. The sudden rush of air had wafted her light, floating drapery of gauze and
                     lace into the fire, and in a moment all was in a blaze. Fortunate was it for
                     her, that under this light, flimsy drapery, was worn a dress of stouter texture
                     and less combustible material—a rich satin. After the slight scream which had
                     brought him to her side, Mary uttered no sound, and with his whole soul
                     concentrated on action, he had been equally silent till the last spark was
                     smothered. Then gazing wildly in her pallid face he exclaimed, "In mercy speak
                     to me! Did I come too late?" Are you burned?</p>
                  <p>"I scarcely know—I think not," she faltered out. Then, as she made an effort to
                     withdraw from his arms, added quickly—"no—not at all."</p>
                  <p>Completely overpowered by the revulsion of feeling which those words
                     occasioned, Herbert clasped her again in his arms, and fervently ejaculating,
                     "Thank God!" pressed his lips to her cheek. At that moment, the voice of Mr.
                     Cavendish was heard in the next room, and breaking from him, Mary rushed to her
                     astonished father, and burying her face in his bosom, burst into tears. Aroused
                     to full consciousness by the presence of another, Herbert stood trembling and
                     dismayed at the remembrance of his own rashness. Agitated as she was, Mary was
                     compelled to answer her father's questions, for he seemed wholly unable to
                     speak.</p>
                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7156-00000016"/>
                  <p>"Latimer, I owe my child's life probably to you. How shall I repay the debt?"
                     cried Mr. Cavendish, attempting, as he spoke, to clasp Herbert's hand. He
                     winced at the touch, and a sudden contraction passed over his face.</p>
                  <p>"You are burned," said Mr. Cavendish, and would have examined his hand, but
                     throwing his handkerchief over it, Herbert declared it was not worth
                     mentioning, though at the same time he confessed that the pain was sufficient
                     to make him desirous to return home, and have some soothing application made to
                     it. Mr. Cavendish parted from him with regret, with earnest charges that he
                     should take care of himself, and equally earnest hopes that he might be
                     sufficiently relieved to return to them before the evening was passed; but Mary
                     still lay in her father's arms, with her face hidden, and noticed Herbert's
                     departure neither by word nor look.</p>
                  <p>"I have outraged her delicacy, and she cannot bear even to see me," he said to
                     himself.</p>
                  <p>In passing out he accidentally trod on the flowers which he had selected with
                     such care—"crushed like my own heart!" he ejaculated mentally.</p>
                  <p>A fortnight passed before Herbert Latimer could take his accustomed place in
                     the office of Mr. Cavendish. His hand had been deeply burned—so deeply that the
                     pain had produced fever. During this period of suffering, Mr. Cavendish had
                     often visited him, and Mrs. Cavendish had more than once taken his mother's
                     place at his bedside; but Herbert found little pleasure in their attentions,
                     for he said to himself, "If they knew all my presumption, they would be less
                     kind."</p>
                  <p>His illness passed away, his hands healed, and he resumed his accustomed
                     avocations; but no invitation, however urgent, could win him again to the house
                     of Mr. Cavendish. "I have proved my own weakness—I will not place myself again
                     in the way of temptation," was the language of his heart. Apologies became
                     awkward. He felt that he must seem to his friend ungracious if not ungrateful;
                     and one day observing unusual seriousness in the countenance of Mr. Cavendish
                     on his declining an invitation to dine with him, he exclaimed, "You look
                     displeased, and I can scarcely wonder at it; but could you know my reason for
                     denying myself the pleasure of visiting you, I am sure you would think me
                     right."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps so; but as I do not know it, you cannot be surprised that your
                     determined withdrawal from our circle should wound both my feelings and those
                     of my family."</p>
                  <p>Herbert covered his eyes with his hand for a moment, and then turning them with
                     a grave and even sad expression on Mr. Cavendish, said, "I have declined your
                     invitations only because I could not accept them with honor: I love your
                     daughter—I have loved her almost from the first hour of my acquaintance with
                     her."</p>
                  <p>"And why have you not told me so before, Herbert?" asked Mr. Cavendish, with no
                     anger in his tones.</p>
                  <p>"Because I believed myself capable of loving in silence, and while I wronged no
                     one, I was willing to indulge in the sweet poison of her society; but a moment
                     of danger to her destroyed my self-control. What has been may be again—I have
                     learned to distrust myself—I cannot tamper with temptation, lest I should one
                     day use the position in which you have placed me, and the advantages which you
                     have bestowed on me, in endeavoring to win from you a treasure which you may
                     well be reluctant to yield to me."</p>
                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7156-00000017"/>
                  <p>"Herbert, I only blame you for not having spoken to me sooner of this."</p>
                  <p>"I feel now that I should have done so—it was a want of self-knowledge, the
                     rash confidence of one untried which kept me silent."</p>
                  <p>"No, Herbert—it was a want of knowledge of me—of confidence in my justice—I
                     will not say my kindness. What higher views do you suppose I can entertain for
                     my daughter, than to make her the wife of one who has a prospect of obtaining
                     the highest eminence in my own profession."</p>
                  <p>"If that prospect be mine, to you I owe it—could I make it a plea for asking
                     more?"</p>
                  <p>"You owe what I did for you to the interest and esteem excited by your own
                     qualities, and all I did has only given you a place for the exercise of those
                     qualities—I do not know how you will win Mary's forgiveness for refraining from
                     her society on such slight grounds."</p>
                  <p>"Dare I hope for your permission to seek that forgiveness?"</p>
                  <p>"Dare I hope for your company to dinner to-day?"</p>
                  <p>"Now that you know all, nothing could give me so much pleasure—though I
                     fear—"</p>
                  <p>"What, fearing again!"</p>
                  <p>"I fear that Miss Cavendish is very much displeased with me."</p>
                  <p>"For saving her life?"</p>
                  <p>"No—not exactly that."</p>
                  <p>Herbert Latimer did not confide the cause of his fear to Mr. Cavendish, neither
                     did he suffer it to interfere with his visit on that day. He went to dinner,
                     but stayed to tea, and long after, and as Mary was his companion for much, if
                     not all of this time, we presume that her displeasure could not have been
                     manifested in any very serious manner.</p>
                  <p>It was about six weeks after this renewal of his visits that Mr. Duffield,
                     meeting his friend Mr. Cavendish one morning, accosted him with, "I hear that
                     your daughter is going to marry young Latimer—is it true?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and I heartily wish the affair were over, for I hope Herbert will recover
                     his senses when he is actually married, and now I am obliged to attend to his
                     business and my own too."</p>
                  <p>"Not much profit in that I should think—I manage somewhat differently."</p>
                  <p>"Did you not tell me that you intended forming a partnership with young
                     Conway?"</p>
                  <p>Yes—but before I had done so, I heard that Sprague, who is as well connected as
                     Conway, and a great deal more industrious, would go into business with me on
                     less exacting terms. He has been associated with me for some time. He does all
                     the drudgery of the business, and is content with one-eighth of the profits for
                     five years."</p>
                  <p>"Those are low terms—with talent and connection too, I should think he could
                     have done better."</p>
                  <p>"Why, you see his connections were of little use to him while he was alone, for
                     he was so desperately poor that they did not like to acknowledge him, but I
                     knew as soon as he began to rise they would all notice him, and so it has
                     proved. I have no doubt I shall gain through them more than the thousand
                     dollars a year which Sprague will draw, while I shall be saved every thing
                     which is really disagreeable or laborious in my practice; and you give two
                     thousand dollars a year, and are going to marry your daughter to a gentleman
                     who leaves all the business on your<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7156-00000018"/>
                     hands—which of us, do you think, has attended most successfully to the main
                     chance?"</p>
                  <p>"According to my views of the main chance, it is not to be determined by such
                     data—but even in your own view we may have a very different account to render
                     nine years hence?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, well! Ten years from the day that Latimer passed we will compare
                     notes."</p>
                  <p>Ten years are long in prospective, but it seemed to both parties but a short
                     time when the appointed anniversary came. On that day Mr. Cavendish invited
                     several of his brother lawyers, and amongst them Mr. Duffield, to dinner.
                     Herbert Latimer, his wife and mother, his two noble boys, and though last, not
                     least in importance, if in size, his little girl, her grandfather's especial
                     pet, were of the party. It was a well assorted party. The guests found good
                     cheer and social converse—the cherished friends of the house, food for deeper
                     and higher enjoyment. When the ladies had withdrawn, calling Herbert Latimer to
                     the head of the table, Mr. Cavendish seated himself beside Mr. Duffield.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Duffield!" he exclaimed, "do you know that it is ten years to-day since
                     Herbert Latimer stood before us for examination?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" ejaculated Mr. Duffield, in the tone of one who did not care to pursue
                     the subject farther.</p>
                  <p>"You remember our agreement—are you still willing to make our success in that
                     time a test of the truth of our respective principles?"</p>
                  <p>"It may afford a more conclusive proof of your better judgment in the selection
                     of an associate."</p>
                  <p>"Sprague stands very high in his profession."</p>
                  <p>"Yes—I knew he would, for he has talent and connection— therefore I chose him;
                     but he left me just at the time these were beginning to be available, as soon
                     as the five years for which our agreement was made, had expired."</p>
                  <p>"What occasioned his leaving you?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, Duval offered him better terms than I had done—I should not have cared so
                     much for his going, but he carried off many of my clients, with whom he had
                     ingratiated himself during his connection with me. My business has scarcely
                     recovered yet from the injury which he did it."</p>
                  <p>"He seems to have acted on your own principle, and to have considered the main
                     chance to mean the most money."</p>
                  <p>"And do you suppose Latimer would have remained with you if he could have made
                     better terms for himself?"</p>
                  <p>"I know that during my long illness he was offered double what he was
                     receiving, or could then hope ever to receive from my business, and his reply
                     to the offer was that the bonds forged by gratitude and affection, no interest
                     could break. He has now built up the business again to far more than it was
                     when he joined me—I know that I owe most of it to him, yet he will not listen
                     to any advice to dissolve our partnership. Gentlemen," he said, "I have a
                     sentiment to propose to you which you may drink in wine or water, as you like
                     best. 'THE MAIN CHANCE—always best secured by obedience to the golden rule—as
                     ye would that others should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.'"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>THE morning after Mr. Arlington had commenced our Christmas entertainments with
                  the sketch of his friend Herbert Latimer's life, was dark and gloomy. At least,
                  such was its aspect abroad, where leaden clouds covered the sky, and a cold,
                  sleety rain fell fast; but within, all was bright, and warm, and cheerful.
                  Immediately after breakfast we separated, each in search of amusement suited to
                  his or her own tastes; some to the music room, some to the library, and Robert
                  Dudley and Annie Donaldson to a game of battledore and shuttlecock in the wide
                  hall, with Mr. Arlington for a spectator. As the storm increased, however, all
                  seemed to feel the want of companionship, and without any preconcerted plan, we
                  found ourselves about two hours after breakfast, again assembled in the room in
                  which quiet, patient Mrs. Donaldson sat, ravelling the netting of the last
                  evening.</p>
               <p>"Now for Aunt Nancy's port-folio," cried Annie, as soon as conversation began to
                  flag.</p>
               <p>The proposal was seconded so warmly that, as I could urge nothing against it, the
                  port-folio was immediately produced, and Annie, taking possession of it,
                  commissioned Robert Dudley to draw forth an engraving. That which first presented
                  itself the reader will find on the opposite page.</p>
               <p>"Scene, a chamber by night, a sleeping baby and a sleepy<pb n=" (Illustration) "

                  <pb n="-35" xml:id="VAC7156-00000021"/> mother, a basket of needle-work—I am sure
                  it is needle-work—on the floor, and a cross suspended from the wall," said Annie,
                  describing the engraving which she had taken from Robert.</p>
               <p>"That cross looks promising," said Colonel Donaldson, who likes a little romance
                  as well as any of his daughters. "Let us have the fair lady's history, Aunt
                  Nancy."</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about her," said I, with a smile at his eagerness.</p>
               <p>"Then why, dear Aunt Nancy, did you keep the engraving?" asked Annie.</p>
               <p>"I might answer, because of my interest in the scene it depicts—a scene in which
                  religion seems to shed its sanctifying influence over the tenderest affection and
                  the homeliest duties of our common life; but I had another reason."</p>
               <p>"Ah! I knew it," exclaimed Annie.</p>
               <p>"I first saw this print in company with a very cultivated and interesting German
                  lady, to whose memory the sleeping baby recalled a cradle-song written by her
                  countryman, the brave Körner. She sung it for me, and, as the German is, I am
                  grieved to say, a sealed book to me, she gave me a literal translation of the
                  words, which—"</p>
               <p>"Which you have put into English verse, and written here at the back of the
                  engraving in the finest of all fine writing, and which father will put on his
                  spectacles and read for us."</p>
               <p>"No; I commission Mr. Arlington to do that," said the Colonel, "without his
                  spectacles."</p>
               <p>"First," said I, "let me assure you that the original is full of a simple, natural
                  tenderness, which, I fear in the double process of translating and versifying, has
                  entirely escaped."</p>
               <p>Mr. Arlington, taking the paper from Annie, now read,—</p>

                  <p>"Poor Körner!" said Mr. Arlington, as he concluded reading this song—if indeed
                     it may claim that name in its English dress—"I can sympathize, as few can do,
                     with his mournful memory of mother-love."</p>
                  <p>This was said in a tone of such genuine emotion, that I looked at him with even
                     more pleasure than I had hitherto done.</p>
                  <p>"Such tenderness touches us particularly when found, as in Körner, in union
                     with manly and vigorous qualities—perhaps, because it is a rare combination,"
                     said Mrs. Dudley.</p>
                  <p>"Is it rare?" I asked doubtfully. "The results of my own observation have led
                     me to believe that it is precisely in manly,<pb n="38-39"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000023"/> vigorous, independent minds that we see the
                     fullest development of our simple, natural, home-affections."</p>
                  <p>"You are right, Aunt Nancy," said Col. Donaldson; "it is only boys striving to
                     seem manly and men of boyish minds, who fail to acknowledge with reverence and
                     tenderness the value of a mother's love."</p>
                  <p>"So convinced am I of this," I replied, "that I would ask for no more certain
                     indication of a man's nobility of nature, than his manner to his mother. I
                     remember a striking illustration of the fidelity of such an indication in two
                     brothers of the name of Manning, with whom I was once acquainted. The one was
                     quite a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petit-maître,</foreign> a dandy; the other, a
                     fine creature—large-minded and large-hearted. The first betrayed in every look
                     and movement, that he considered himself greatly his mother's superior, and
                     feared every moment that she should detract from his dignity by some sin
                     against the dicta of fashion; the other did honor at once to her and to
                     himself, by his reverent devotion to her. They were a contrast, and a contrast
                     which circumstances brought out most strikingly. Ah, Mr. Arlington! I wish you
                     could have seen them—a sketch of them from your pencil would have been a
                     picture indeed."</p>
                  <p>"We will take your word-painting instead," said Mr. Arlington.</p>
                  <p>"A mere description in words could not present them to you in all their
                     strongly-marked diversity of character. To do this, I must give you a history
                     of their lives."</p>
                  <p>"And why not?"—and—"Oh, yes, Aunt Nancy, that is just what we want," was echoed
                     from one to another. They consented to delay their gratification till the
                     evening, that I might have a little time to arrange my reminiscences; and when
                     "the hours of long uninterrupted evening" came, and we had<q>

                  <head type="sub">OR, IN THE FASHION AND ABOVE THE FASHION.</head>
                  <p>"SOME men are born to greatness—some achieve greatness, and some have greatness
                     thrust upon them." Henry Manning belonged to the second of these three great
                     classes. The son of a mercantile adventurer, who won and lost a fortune by
                     speculation, he found himself at sixteen years of age called on to choose
                     between the life of a Western farmer, with its vigorous action, stirring
                     incident and rough usage—and the life of a clerk in one of the most noted
                     establishments in Broadway, the great source and centre of fashion in New-York.
                     Mr. Morgan, the brother of Mrs. Manning, who had been recalled from the distant
                     West by the death of her husband, and the embarrassments into which that event
                     had plunged her, had obtained the offer of the last situation for one of his
                     two nephews, and would take the other with him to his prairie home.</p>
                  <p>"I do not ask you to go with me, Matilda," he said to his sister, "because our
                     life is yet too wild and rough to suit a delicate woman, reared, as you have
                     been, in the midst of luxurious refinements. The difficulties and privations of
                     life in the West fall most heavily upon woman, while she has little of that
                        sustaining<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7156-00000024"/> taining power which
                     man's more adventurous spirit finds in overcoming difficulty and coping with
                     danger. But let me have one of your boys; and by the time he has arrived at
                     manhood, he will be able, I doubt not, to offer you in his home all the
                     comforts, if not all the elegancies, of your present abode."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Manning consented; and now the question was, which of her sons should
                     remain with her, and which should accompany Mr. Morgan. To Henry Manning, older
                     by two years than his brother George, the choice of situations was submitted.
                     He went with his uncle to the Broadway establishment, heard the duties which
                     would be demanded from him, the salary which would be given, saw the grace with
                     which the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">élegants</foreign> behind the counter
                     displayed their silks, and satins, and velvets, to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >élegantes</foreign> before the counter, and the decision with which they
                     promulgated the decrees of fashion; and with that just sense of his own powers,
                     which is the accompaniment of true genius, he decided at once that there lay
                     his vocation. George, who had not been without difficulty kept quiet, while his
                     brother was forming his decision, as soon as it was announced, sprang forward
                     with a whoop that would have suited a Western forest better than a New-York
                     drawing-room, threw the Horace he was reading across the table, clasped first
                     his mother and then his uncle in his arms, and exclaimed, "I am the boy for the
                     West. I will help you fell forests and build cities there, uncle. Why should
                     not we build cities as well as Romulus and Remus?"</p>
                  <p>"I will supply your cities with all their silks, and satins, and velvets, and
                     laces, and charge them nothing, George," said Henry Manning, with that air of
                     superiority with which the worldly-wise often look on the sallies of the
                     enthusiast.</p>
                  <p>"You make my head ache, my son," complained Mrs. Manning ning, shrinking from
                     his boisterous gratulation;—but Mr. Morgan returned his hearty embrace, and as
                     he gazed into his bold, bright face, with an eye as bright as his own, replied
                     to his burst of enthusiasm, "You <emph>are</emph> the very boy for the West,
                     George. It is out of such brave stuff that pioneers and city-builders are
                     always made."</p>
                  <p>Henry Manning soon bowed himself into the favor of the ladies who formed the
                     principal customers of his employer. By his careful and really correct habits,
                     and his elegant taste in the selection and arrangement of goods, he became also
                     a favorite with his employers themselves. They needed an agent for the
                     selection of goods abroad, and they sent him. He purchased cloths for them in
                     England, and silks in France, and came home with the reputation of a travelled
                     man. Having persuaded his mother to advance a capital for him by selling out
                     the bank stock in which Mr. Morgan had funded her little fortune, at
                     twenty-four years of age he entered business for himself as a French importer.
                     Leaving a partner to attend to the sales at home, he went abroad for the
                     selection of goods, and the further enhancement of his social reputation. He
                     returned in two years with a fashionable figure, a most <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >recherché</foreign> style of dress, moustachios of the most approved cut,
                     and whiskers of faultless curl—a finished gentleman in his own conceit. With
                     such attractions, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">prestige</foreign> which he
                     derived from his reported travels and long residence abroad, and the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">savoir faire</foreign> of one who had made the conventional
                     arrangements of society his study, he quickly rose to the summit of his wishes,
                     to the point which it had been his life's ambition to attain. He became the
                     umpire of taste, and his word was received as the fiat of fashion. He continued
                     to reside with his mother, and paid great attention to her style of dress, and
                     the arrangements of her<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7156-00000025"/> house, for it
                     was important that <emph>his</emph> mother should appear properly. Poor Mrs.
                     Manning! she sometimes thought that proud title dearly purchased by listening
                     to his daily criticisms on appearance, language, manners, which had been
                     esteemed stylish enough in their day.</p>
                  <p>George Manning had visited his mother but once since he left her with all the
                     bright imaginings and boundless confidence of fourteen, and then Henry was in
                     Europe. It was during the first winter after his return, and when the brothers
                     had been separated for nearly twelve years, that Mrs. Manning informed him she
                     had received a letter from George, announcing his intention to be in New-York
                     in December, and to remain with them through most if not all of the winter.
                     Henry Manning was evidently annoyed at the announcement.</p>
                  <p>"I wish," he said, "that George had chosen to make his visit in the summer,
                     when most of the people to whom I should hesitate to introduce him would have
                     been absent. I should be sorry to hurt his feelings, but really, to introduce a
                     Western farmer into polished society—" Henry Manning shuddered, and was silent.
                     "And then to choose this winter of all winters for his visit, and to come in
                     December, just at the very time that I heard yesterday Miss Harcourt was coming
                     from Washington to spend a few weeks with her friend, Mrs. Duffield!"</p>
                  <p>"And what has Miss Harcourt's visit to Mrs. Duffield to do with George's visit
                     to us?" asked Mrs. Manning.</p>
                  <p>"A great deal—at least it has a great deal to do with my regret that he should
                     come just now. I told you how I became acquainted with Emma Harcourt in Europe,
                     and what a splendid creature she is. Even in Paris, she bore the palm for wit
                     and beauty—and fashion too—that is in English and American society. But I did
                     not tell you that she received me with such distinguishing favor, and evinced
                     so much pretty consciousness at my attentions, that, had not her father, having
                     been chosen one of the electors of President and Vice President, hurried from
                     Paris in order to be in this country in time for his vote, I should probably
                     have been induced to marry her. Her father is in Congress this year, and you
                     see, she no sooner learns that I am here, than the comes to spend part of the
                     winter with a friend in New York."</p>
                  <p>Henry rose at this, walked to a glass, surveyed his elegant figure, and
                     continuing to cast occasional glances at it as he walked backwards and forwards
                     through the room, resumed the conversation, or rather his own
                     communication.</p>
                  <p>"All this is very encouraging, doubtless; but Emma Harcourt is so perfectly
                     elegant, so thoroughly refined, that I dread the effect upon her of any
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">outré</foreign> association—by the by, mother, if I
                     obtain her permission to introduce you to her, you will not wear that brown hat
                     in visiting her—a brown hat is my aversion—it is positively vulgar—but to
                     return to George—how can I introduce him, with his rough, boisterous, Western
                     manner, to this courtly lady?—the very thought chills me"—and Henry Manning
                     shivered—"and yet, how can I avoid it, if we should be engaged?"</p>
                  <p>With December came the beautiful Emma Harcourt, and Mrs. Duffield's house was
                     thronged with her admirers. Hers was the form and movement of the Huntress
                     Queen rather than of one trained in the halls of fashion. There was a joyous
                     freedom in her air, her step, her glance, which, had she been less beautiful,
                     less talented, less fortunate in social position or in wealth, would have
                     placed her under the ban of fashion; but, as it was, she commanded fashion, and
                     even Henry Manning, the very slave of conventionalism, had no criticism for
                     her. He had been among<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7156-00000026"/> the first to
                     call on her, and the blush that flitted across her cheek, the smile that played
                     upon her lips, as he was announced, might well have flattered one even of less
                     vanity.</p>
                  <p>The very next day, before Henry had had time to improve these symptoms in his
                     favor, on returning home, at five o'clock, to his dinner, he found a stranger
                     in the parlor with his mother. The gentleman rose on his entrance, and he had
                     scarcely time to glance at the tall, manly form, the lofty air, the commanding
                     brow, ere he found himself clasped in his arms, with the exclamation, "Dear
                     Henry! how rejoiced I am to see you again."</p>
                  <p>In George Manning the physical and intellectual man had been developed in rare
                     harmony. He was taller and larger every way than his brother Henry, and the
                     self-reliance which the latter had laboriously attained from the mastery of all
                     conventional rules, was his by virtue of a courageous soul, which held itself
                     above all rules but those prescribed by its own high sense of the right. There
                     was a singular contrast, rendered yet more striking by some points of
                     resemblance, between the pupil of society, and the child of the forest—between
                     the Parisian elegance of Henry, and the proud, free grace of George. His were
                     the step and bearing which we have seen in an Indian chief; but thought had
                     left its impress on his brow, and there was in his countenance that
                     indescribable air of refinement which marks a polished mind. In a very few
                     minutes Henry became reconciled to his brother's arrival, and satisfied with
                     him in all respects but one—his dress. This was of the finest cloth, but made
                     into large, loose trowsers, and a species of hunting-shirt, trimmed with fur,
                     belted around the waist, and descending to the knee, instead of the tight
                     pantaloons and closely fitting body coat prescribed by fashion. The little
                     party lingered long over the table—it was seven o'clock before they arose from
                     it.</p>
                  <p>"Dear mother," said George Manning, "I am sorry to leave you this evening, but
                     I will make you rich amends to-morrow by introducing to you the friend I am
                     going to visit, if you will permit me. Henry, it is so long since I was in New
                     York that I need some direction in finding my way—must I turn up or down
                     Broadway for Number—, in going from this street?"</p>
                  <p>"Number—," exclaimed Henry in surprise; "you must be mistaken—that is Mrs.
                     Duffield's."</p>
                  <p>"Then I am quite right, for it is at Mrs. Duffield's that I expect to meet my
                     friend this evening."</p>
                  <p>With some curiosity to know what friend of George could have so completely the
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entrée</foreign> of the fashionable Mrs. Duffield's
                     house as to make an appointment there, Henry proposed to go with him and show
                     him the way. There was a momentary hesitation in George's manner before he
                     replied, "Very well, I will be obliged to you."</p>
                  <p>"But—excuse me George—you are not surely going in that dress—this is one of
                     Mrs. Duffield's reception evenings, and, early as it is, you will find company
                     there."</p>
                  <p>George laughed as he replied; "They must take me as I am, Henry. We do not
                     receive our fashions from Paris at the West."</p>
                  <p>Henry almost repented his offer to accompany his brother; but it was too late
                     to withdraw, for George, unconscious of this feeling, had taken his cloak and
                     cap and was awaiting his escort. As they approached Mrs. Duffield's house,
                     George, who had hitherto led the conversation, became silent, or answered his
                     brother only in monosyllables, and then not always to the purpose. As they
                     entered the hall, the hats and cloaks displayed there showed that, as Henry
                     supposed, they were not the earliest<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7156-00000027"/>
                     visitors. George paused for a moment, and then said, "You must go in without
                     me, Henry. Show me to a room where there is no company," he continued, turning
                     to a servant—"and take this card in to Mrs. Duffield—be sure to give it to Mrs.
                     Duffield herself."</p>
                  <p>The servant bowed low to the commanding stranger; and Henry, almost
                     mechanically, obeyed his direction, muttering to himself, "Free and easy, upon
                     my honor." He had scarcely entered the usual reception-room and made his bow to
                     Mrs. Duffield, when the servant presented his brother's card. He watched her
                     closely, and saw a smile playing over her lips as her eyes rested on it. She
                     glanced anxiously at Miss Harcourt, and crossing the room to a group in which
                     she stood, she drew her aside. After a few whispered words, Mrs. Duffield
                     placed the card in Miss Harcourt's hand. A sudden flash of joy irradiated every
                     feature of her beautiful face, and Henry Manning saw that, but for Mrs.
                     Duffield's restraining hand, she would have rushed from the room. Recalled thus
                     to a recollection of others, she looked around her, and her eyes met his. In an
                     instant, her face was covered with blushes, and she drew back with embarrassed
                     consciousness,—almost immediately, however, she raised her head with a proud,
                     bright expression, and though she did not look at Henry Manning, he felt that
                     she was conscious of his observation, as she passed with a composed yet joyous
                     step from the room.</p>
                  <p>Henry Manning was awaking from a dream. It was not a very pleasant awakening,
                     but as his vanity rather than his heart was touched, he was able to conceal his
                     chagrin, and appear as interesting and agreeable as usual. He now expected with
                     some impatience the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement</foreign> of the comedy.
                     An hour passed away, and Mrs. Duffield's eye began to consult the marble clock
                     on her mantel-piece. The chime for another half hour rang out; and she left the
                     room and returned in a few minutes, leaning on the arm of George Manning.</p>
                  <p>"Who is that?—"What noble-looking man is that?" were questions Henry Manning
                     heard from many—from a very few only the exclamation, "How oddly he is
                     dressed!" Before the evening was over Henry began to feel that he was eclipsed
                     on his own theatre—that George, if not <emph>in the fashion,</emph> was yet
                     more <emph>the fashion</emph> than he.</p>
                  <p>Following the proud, happy glance of his brother's eye, a quarter of an hour
                     later, Henry saw Miss Harcourt entering the room in an opposite direction from

                     it was a fruitless caution. None who had seen her before could fail now to
                     observe the softened character of her beauty, and those who saw <q>

                  <p>The next morning, George Manning brought Miss Harcourt to visit his mother; and
                     Mrs. Manning rose greatly in her son Henry's estimation when he saw the
                     affectionate deference evinced to her by the proud beauty.</p>
                  <p>"How strange my manner must have seemed to you sometimes," said Miss Harcourt
                     to Henry one day. "I was engaged to George long before I met you in Europe; and
                     though I never<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7156-00000028"/> had courage to mention
                     him to you, I wondered a little that you never spoke of him. I never doubted
                     for a moment that you were acquainted with our engagement."</p>
                  <p>"I do not even yet understand where and how you and George met."</p>
                  <p>"We met at home—my father was Governor of the Territory—State now—in which your
                     uncle lives: our homes were very near each other's, and so we met almost daily
                     while I was still a child. We have had all sorts of adventures together; for
                     George was a great favorite with my father, and I was permitted to go with him
                     any where. He has saved my life twice—once at the imminent peril of his own,
                     when with the wilfulness of a spoiled child I would ride a horse which he told
                     me I could not manage. Oh! you know not half his nobleness," and tears
                     moistened the bright eyes of the happy girl.</p>
                  <p>Henry Manning was touched through all his conventionalism, yet the moment after
                     he said, "George is a fine fellow, certainly; but I wish you could persuade him
                     to dress a little more like other people."</p>
                  <p>"I would not if I could," exclaimed Emma Harcourt, while the blood rushed to
                     her temples; "fashions and all such conventional regulations are made for those
                     who have no innate perception of the right, the noble, the beautiful—not for
                     such as he—he is above fashion."</p>
                  <p>What Emma would not ask, she yet did not fail to recognize as another proof of
                     correct judgment, when George Manning laid aside his Western costume and
                     assumed one less remarkable.</p>
                  <p>Henry Manning had received a new idea—that there are those who are above the
                     fashion. Allied to this was another thought, which in time found entrance to
                     his mind, that it would be at least as profitable to devote our energies to the
                     acquisition of true nobility of soul, pure and high thought and refined taste,
                     as to the study of those conventionalisms which are but their outer garment,
                     and can at best only conceal for a short time their absence.</p>

               <p>THE next day was brilliant. Snow had fallen during the night, and the sun, which
                  rose without a cloud, was reflected back from it with dazzling brightness, while
                  every branch and spray glittered in its casing of ice as though it had been a huge
                  diamond. Before we met at breakfast, the younger members of the party had decided
                  on a sleigh-ride. Even Col. Donaldson, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">malgré</foreign>
                  old age and rheumatism, found himself unable to resist the cheerful morning and
                  their gay solicitations, and accompanied them. Mrs. Donaldson and I were left
                  alone, a circumstance which did not afflict either of us. Mrs. Donaldson was never
                  at a loss for pleasant occupation for her hours, and Annie had given me something
                  to do in parting.</p>
               <p>"Remember, Aunt Nancy, we shall look to you for our entertainment this evening;
                  you shall be permitted to choose your subject. Is not that gracious?" she added,
                  with a laugh at her own style of command, springing at the same moment from the
                  sleigh in which Mr. Arlington had already placed himself at her side, and running
                  up the steps to the piazza, where I stood, that she might give me another kiss,
                  and satisfy herself that she had not wounded the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">amour
                     propre</foreign> of her old friend, by speaking so much <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >en reine.</foreign> I was, in truth, pleased to be reminded of the demand
                  which might be made on me in the evening, while I had<pb n=" (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC7156-00000030"/>
                  <figure/>
                  <pb n="51" xml:id="VAC7156-00000031"/> time to glance over sketches intended only
                  for myself, and ascertain if they contained any thing likely to interest
                  others.</p>
               <p>A late dinner re-united us, and the fatigues of the morning having been repaired
                  by an hour's rest in the afternoon, our party was more than usually fresh and
                  ready for enjoyment when we met in the evening. I had availed myself of Annie's
                  permission, and selected my subject. It was a crayon sketch of a lovely lake—the
                  reader has an engraving of it on the opposite page—made by Philip Oswald, the son
                  of one of my most valued friends. The sketch was made while all around remained in
                  the wildness of uncultivated nature. Since that day, the stillness has been
                  disturbed by the sound of the axe and the hammer. Upon the borders of that lovely
                  lake, a fair home has risen, from which the incense of grateful and loving hearts
                  has gone up to the Creator of so much beauty. The associations which made this
                  scene peculiarly interesting to me I had long since written out, and now give to
                  the reader under the title of</p>

                  <head type="sub">OR, HEARTS VERSUS DIAMONDS.</head>
                  <p>WINTER had thrown its icy fetters over the Hudson, and stilled even the
                     stormier waves of the East River, as the inhabitants of New York designate that
                     portion of the Harbor which lies between their city and Brooklyn. The city
                     itself—its streets—its houses—all wore the livery of this "ruler of the
                     inverted year"—while in many a garret and cellar of its crowded streets, ragged
                     children huddled together, seeking to warm their frozen limbs<pb n="52-53"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000032"/> beneath, the scanty covering of their beds, or
                     cowering over the few half-dying embers, which they misnamed a fire. Yet the
                     social affections were not chilled—rather did they seem to glow more warmly, as
                     if rejoicing in their triumph over the mighty conquerer of the physical world.
                     Christian charity went forth unchecked through the frosty air and over the
                     snow-clad streets, to shelter the houseless, to clothe the naked, to warm the
                     freezing. Human sympathies awoke to new life the dying hopes and failing
                     energies of man, and the sleigh-bells, ringing out their joyous peals through
                     the day, and far, far into the night, told that the young and fair were abroad,
                     braving all the severities of the season, in their eager search after pleasure.
                     In the neighborhood of Waverley Place, especially, on the evening of the 16th
                     of December, did this merry music "wake the silent air" to respond to the quick
                     beatings of the gay young hearts anticipating the fête of fêtes, the most
                     brilliant party of the season, which was that evening to be given at the house
                     of the ruler of fashion—the elegant Mrs. Bruton.</p>
                  <p>Instead of introducing our readers to the gay assemblage of this lady's guests,
                     we will take them to the dressing-room of the fairest among them, the
                     beautiful, the gay, the brilliant Caroline Danby. As the door of this inner
                     temple of beauty opens at the touch of our magic wand, its inmate is seen
                     standing before a mirror, and her eye beams, and her lip is smiling with
                     anticipated triumph. Does there seem vanity in the gaze she fastens there? Look
                     on that form of graceful symmetry, on those large black eyes with their jetty
                     fringes, on the rich coloring of her rounded cheeks, and the dewy freshness of
                     her red lip, and you will forget to censure. But see, the mirror reflects
                     another form—a form so slender that it seems scarce to have attained the full
                     proportions of womanhood, and a face whose soft gray eyes and fair complexion,
                     and hair of the palest gold, present a singular contrast to the dark yet
                     glowing beauty beside her. This is Mary Grayson, the orphan cousin of Caroline
                     Danby, who has grown up in her father's house. She has glided in with her usual
                     gentle movement, and light, noiseless step, and Caroline first perceives her in
                     the glass.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Mary!" she exclaims, "I sent for you to put this diamond spray in my hair;
                     you arrange it with so much more taste than any one else."</p>
                  <p>Mary smilingly receives the expensive ornament, and fastens it amidst the dark,
                     glossy tresses. At this moment the door-bell gives forth a hasty peal, and
                     going to the head of the stairs, Mary remains listening till the door is
                     opened, and then comes back to say, "Mrs. Oswald, Caroline, and Philip."</p>
                  <p>"Pray, go down and entertain them till I come, Mary"—and seemingly nothing
                     loth, Mary complies with the request.</p>
                  <p>In the drawing-room to which Mary Grayson directed her steps stood a stately
                     looking lady, who advanced to meet her as she entered, and kissing her
                     affectionately, asked, "Are you not going with us this evening?"</p>
                  <p>"No; my sore throat has increased, and the Doctor is positive; there is no
                     appeal from him, you know; I am very sorry, for I wanted to see some of
                     Philip's foreign graces," she said playfully, as she turned to give her hand to
                     a gentleman who had entered while she was speaking. He received it with the
                     frank kindness of a brother, but before he could reply the door of the
                     drawing-room opened, and Caroline Danby appeared within it. Philip Oswald
                     sprang forward to greet her, and from that moment seemed forgetful that there
                     was any other thing in life deserving<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7156-00000033"/>
                     his attention, save her radiant beauty. Perhaps there was some little regard to
                     the effect of his first glance at that beauty, in her presenting herself in the
                     drawing-room with her cloak and hood upon her arm, the diamond sparkling in her
                     uncovered tresses, and the soft, rich folds of her satin dress and its flowing
                     lace draperies, shading without concealing the graceful outline of her form.
                     The gentleman who gazed so admiringly upon her, who wrapped her cloak around
                     her with such tender care, and even insisted, kneeling gracefully before her,
                     on fastening himself the warm, furred overshoes upon her slender foot, seemed a
                     fit attendant at the shrine of beauty. Philip Oswald had been but a few weeks
                     at home, after an absence of four years spent in European travel. The quality
                     in his appearance and manners, which first impressed the observer, was
                     refinement—perfect elegance, without the least touch of coxcombry. It had been
                     said of him, that he had brought home the taste in dress of a Parisian, the
                     imaginativeness of a German, and the voice and passion for music of an Italian,
                     Few were admitted to such intimacy with him as to look into the deeper
                     qualities of the mind—but those who were, saw there the sturdy honesty of John
                     Bull, and the courageous heart and independent spirit of his own America. Some
                     of those who knew him best, regretted that the possession of a fortune, which
                     placed him among the wealthiest in America, would most probably consign him to
                     a life of indolence, in which his highest qualities would languish for want of
                     exercise.</p>
                  <p>By nine o'clock Caroline Danby's preparations were completed, and leaning on
                     one of Philip Oswald's arms, while the other was given to his mother, she was
                     led out, and placed in the most splendid sleigh in New-York, and wrapped in the
                     most costly furs. Philip followed, the weary coachman touched his spirited
                     horses with the whip, the sleigh-bells rang merrily out, and Mary Grayson was
                     left in solitude.</p>
                  <p>The last stroke of three had ceased to vibrate on the air when Caroline Danby
                     again stood beside her cousin. Mary was sleeping, and a painter might have
                     hesitated whether to give the palm of beauty to the soft, fair face, which
                     looked so angel-like in its placid sleep, or to that which bent above her in
                     undimmed brilliancy.</p>
                  <p>"Is it you, Caroline? What time is it?" asked Mary, as she roused at her
                     cousin's call.</p>
                  <p>"Three o'clock; but wake up, Mary; I have something to tell you, which must not
                     be heard by sleepy ears."</p>
                  <p>"How fresh you look!" exclaimed Mary, sitting up in bed and looking at her
                     cousin admiringly. "Who would believe you had been dancing all night!"</p>
                  <p>"I have not been dancing all night, nor half the night."</p>
                  <p>"Why—what have you been doing then?"</p>
                  <p>"Listening to Philip Oswald. Oh Mary! I am certainly the most fortunate woman
                     in the world. He is mine at last—he, the most elegant, the most brilliant man
                     in New-York, and with such a splendid fortune. I was so happy, so excited, that
                     I could not sleep, and therefore I woke you to talk."</p>
                  <p>"I am glad you did, for I am almost as much pleased as you can be—such joy is
                     better than sleep;—but all the bells in the city seem to be ringing—did you see
                     any thing of the fire?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh yes! the whole sky at the southeast is glowing from the flames—the largest
                     fire, they say, that has ever been known in the city—but it is far enough from
                     us—down in Wall-street—and who can think of fires with such joy before them?
                     Only think, Mary, with Philip's fortune and Philip's taste, what an
                     establishment I shall have."</p>
                  <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7156-00000034"/>
                  <p>"And what a mother in dear, good Mrs. Oswald!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—but I hope she will not want to live with us—mothers-in-law, you know,
                     always want to manage every thing in their sons' houses."</p>
                  <p>Thus the cousins sat talking till the fire-bells ceased their monotonous and
                     ominous clang, and the late dawn of a winter morning reddened the eastern sky.
                     It was half past nine o'clock when they met again at their breakfast; yet late
                     as it was, Mr. Danby, usually a very early riser, was not quite ready for it.
                     He had spent most of the night at the scene of the fire, and had with great
                     difficulty and labor saved his valuable stock of French goods from the
                     destroyer. When he joined his daughter and niece, his mind was still under the
                     influence of the last night's excitement, and he could talk of nothing but the
                     fire.</p>
                  <p>"Rather expensive fireworks, I am afraid," said Caroline flippantly, as her
                     father described the lurid grandeur of the scene.</p>
                  <p>"Do not speak lightly, my daughter, of that which must reduce many from
                     affluence to beggary. Millions of property were lost last night. The 16th of
                     December, 1835, will long be remembered in the annals of New-York, I fear."</p>
                  <p>"It will long be remembered in <emph>my</emph> annals," whispered Caroline to
                     her cousin, with a bright smile, despite her father's chiding.</p>
                  <p>"Not at home to any but Mr. Philip Oswald," had been Caroline Danby's order to
                     the servant this morning; and thus when she was told, at twelve o'clock, that
                     that gentleman awaited her in the drawing-room, she had heard nothing more of
                     the fire than her father and the morning paper had communicated. As she
                     entered, Philip rose to greet her, but though he strove to smile as his eyes
                     met hers, the effort was vain; and throwing himself back on the sofa, he
                     covered his face with his hand, as if to hide his pallor and the convulsive
                     quivering of his lips from her whom he was reluctant to grieve. Emboldened by
                     her fears, Caroline advanced, and laying her hand on his, exclaimed, "What is
                     the matter?—Are you ill?—your mother?—pray do not keep me in suspense, but tell
                     me what has happened."</p>
                  <p>He seemed to have mastered his emotion, from whatever cause it had proceeded;
                     for removing his hand, he looked earnestly upon her, and drawing her to a seat
                     beside him, said in firm, though sad tones, "That has happened, Caroline, which
                     would not move me thus, but for your dear sake—I asked you last night to share
                     my fortune—to-day I have none to offer you."</p>
                  <p>"Gracious heaven!" exclaimed Caroline, turning as pale as he, "what do you
                     mean?"</p>
                  <p>"That in the fire of last night, or the failures which the most sanguine assure
                     me it must produce, my whole fortune is involved. If I can recover from the
                     wreck what will secure to my poor mother the continuance of her accustomed
                     comforts, it will be beyond my hopes: for me—the luxuries, the comforts, the
                     very necessaries of life must be the produce of my own exertion. I do not ask
                     you to share my poverty, Caroline; I cannot be so selfish: had I not spoken of
                     my love last night, you should never have heard it—though it had been like a
                     burning fire, I would have shut it up within my heart—but it is too late for
                     this; you have heard it, and I have heard—the remembrance brings with it a
                     wild, delirious joy, even in this hour of darkness"—and the pale face of Philip
                     Oswald flushed, and his dimmed eye beamed brightly again as he spoke: "I have
                        heard<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7156-00000035"/> your sweet confession of
                     reciprocal regard. Months, perhaps years may pass before I attain the goal at
                     which I last night thought myself to have already arrived—before I can dare to
                     call you mine—but in our land, manly determination and perseverance ever
                     command success, and I fear not to promise you, dearest, one day a happy
                     home—though not a splendid one—if you will promise me to share it. Look on me,
                     Caroline—give me one smile to light me on my way—with such a hope before me, I
                     cannot say my <emph>dreary</emph> way."</p>
                  <p>He ceased, yet Caroline neither looked upon him, nor spoke. Her cheek had grown
                     pale at his words, and she sat with down-cast eyes, cold, still, statue-like at
                     his side. Yet did not Philip Oswald doubt her love. Had not her eye kindled and
                     her cheek flushed at his whispered vows—had not her hand rested lovingly in
                     his, and her lip been yielded to the first kiss of love—how then could he dare
                     to doubt her? She was grieved for his sake—he had been selfishly abrupt in his
                     first communication of his sorrow, and now he—the stronger—must struggle to
                     bear and to speak cheerfully for her sake. And with this feeling he had been
                     able to conclude far more cheerfully than he commenced. As she still continued
                     silent, he bent forward, and would have pressed his lips to her cheek, saying;
                     "Not one word for me, dear one,"—but drawing hastily back, Caroline said with
                     great effort,</p>
                  <p>"I think, Mr. Oswald—it seems to me—that—that—an engagement must be a heavy
                     burden to one who has to make his own way in life—I—I should be sorry to be a
                     disadvantage to you."</p>
                  <p>It was a crushing blow, and for an instant he sat stunned into almost
                     death-like stillness by it:—but he rallied; he would leave no loop on which
                     hope or fancy might hereafter hang a doubt. "Caroline," he said, in a voice
                     whose change spoke the intensity of his feeling, "do not speak of disadvantage
                     to me—your love was the one star left in my sky—but that matters not—what I
                     would know is, whether you desire that the record of last evening should be
                     blotted from the history of our lives?"</p>
                  <p>"I—I think it had better be—I am sure I wish you well, Mr. Oswald."</p>
                  <p>It was well for her, perhaps, that she did not venture to meet his eye—that
                     look of withering scorn could scarce ever have vanished from her memory—it was
                     enough to hear his bitter laugh and the accents in which he said, "Thank you,
                     Miss Danby—your wishes are fully reciprocated—may you never know a love less
                     prudent than your own."</p>
                  <p>The door closed on him, and she was alone—left to the companionship of her own
                     heart—evil companionship in such an hour! She hastened to relate all that had
                     passed to Mary, but Mary had no assurances for her—she had only sympathy for
                     Philip—"dear Philip"—as she called him over and over again. "I think it would
                     better become one so young as you are, to say, Mr. Oswald, Mary," said
                     Caroline, pettishly.</p>
                  <p>"I have called him Philip from my childhood, Caroline,—I shall not begin to say
                     Mr. Oswald <emph>now.</emph>" Mary did not mean a reproach, but to Caroline's
                     accusing conscience it sounded like one, and she turned away indignantly. She
                     soon, however, sought her cousin again with a note in her hand.</p>
                  <p>"I have been writing to Mrs. Oswald, Mary," she said; "you are perhaps too
                     young, and Mr. Oswald too much absorbed in his own disappointment, to estimate
                     the propriety of my conduct; but she will, I am sure, agree with me, that one
                        expensively<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7156-00000036"/> reared as I have been,
                     accustomed to every luxury, and perfectly ignorant of economy, would make the
                     worst possible wife to a poor man; and she has so much influence over Mr.
                     Oswald, that if she think so, she can soon persuade him of the same thing. Will
                     you take my note to her? I do not like to send it by a servant—it might fall
                     into Philip's hands."</p>
                  <p>Nothing could have pleased Mary more than this commission, for her affectionate
                     heart was longing to offer its sympathy to her friends. Mrs. Oswald assumed
                     perhaps a little more than her usual stateliness when she heard her announced,
                     but it vanished instantly before Mary's tearful eyes, as she kissed the hand
                     that was extended to her. Mrs. Oswald folded her arms around her, and Mary sank
                     sobbing upon the bosom of her whom she had come to console. And Mrs. Oswald was
                     consoled by such true and tender sympathy. It was long before Mary could
                     prevail on herself to disturb the flow of gentler affections by delivering
                     Caroline's note. Mrs. Oswald received it with an almost contemptuous smile,
                     which remained unchanged while she read. It was a labored effort to make her
                     conduct seem a generous determination not to obstruct Philip's course in life,
                     by binding him to a companion so unsuitable to his present prospects as
                     herself. In reply, Mrs. Oswald assured Caroline Danby of her perfect agreement
                     with her in the conviction that she would make a very unsuitable wife for
                     Philip Oswald. "This," she added, "was always my opinion, though I was
                     unwilling to oppose my son's wishes. I thank you for having convinced him I was
                     right in the only point on which we ever differed."</p>
                  <p>It cannot be supposed that this note was very pleasing to Caroline Danby; but,
                     whatever was her dissatisfaction, she did not complain, and probably soon lost
                     all remembrance of her chagrin in the gayeties which a few men of fortune still
                     remained, amidst the almost universal ruin, to promote and to partake.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, Philip Oswald was experiencing that restlessness, that
                     burning desire to free himself from all his present associations, to begin, as
                     it were, a new life, which the first pressure of sorrow so often arouses in the
                     ardent spirit. Had not his will been "bound down by the iron chain of
                     necessity," he would probably have returned to Europe, and wasted his energies
                     amid aimless wanderings. As it was, he chose among those modes of life demanded
                     by his new circumstances, that which would take him farthest from New-York, and
                     place him in a condition the most foreign to all his past experience, and
                     demanding the most active and most incessant exertion. Out of that which the
                     fire, the failure of Insurance Companies and of private individuals, had left
                     him, remained, after the purchase of a liberal annuity for his mother, a few
                     thousands to be devoted either to merchandise, to his support while pursuing
                     the studies necessary for the acquirement of a profession, or to any mode of
                     gaining a living, which he might prefer to these. The very hour which
                     ascertained this fact, saw his resolution taken and his course marked out.</p>
                  <p>"I must have new scenery for this new act in the drama of my life," he said to
                     his mother. "I must away—away from all the artificialities and trivialities of
                     my present world, to the rich prairies, the wide streams, the boundless expanse
                     of the West. I go to make a new home for you, dear mother—you shall be the
                     queen of my kingdom."</p>
                  <p>This was not the choice that would have pleased an ambitious, or an over-fond
                     mother. The first would have preferred a profession, as conferring higher
                     social distinction; the last would have shrunk from seeing one nursed in the
                     lap of luxury go forth<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7156-00000037"/> to encounter
                     the hardships of a pioneer. But Mrs. Oswald possessed an intelligence which
                     recognized in that life of bold adventure, and physical endurance, and
                     persevering labor, that awaited her son in the prosecution of his plans, the
                     best school for the development of that decision and force of character which
                     she had desired as the crowning seal to Philip's intellectual endowments, warm
                     affections, and just principles, and holding his excellence as the better part
                     of her own happiness, she sanctioned his designs, and did all in her power to
                     promote their execution. He waited, therefore, only to see her leave the house
                     whose rent now exceeded her whole annual income, for pleasant rooms in a
                     boarding-house, agreeably situated, before he set out from New-York.</p>
                  <p>It is not our intention minutely to trace his course, to describe the "local
                     habitation" which he acquired, or detail the difficulties which arose in his
                     progress, the strength with which he combated, or the means by which he
                     overcame them. For his course, suffice it that it was westward; for his
                     habitation, that it was on the slope of a hill crowned with the gigantic trees
                     of that fertile soil, and beside a lake, "a sheet of silver," well fitted to be <q>
                        <l>"A mirror and a bath for beauty's youngest daughters;"</l>
                     </q> and that the house, which he at length succeeded in rearing and furnishing
                     there, united somewhat of the refinement of his past life to the simplicity of
                     his present; for his difficulties, we can only say, he met them and conquered
                     them, and gained from each encounter knowledge and power. For two years,
                     letters were the only medium of intercourse between his mother and himself, but
                     those letters were a history—a history not only of his stirring, outer life,
                     but of that inner life which yet more deeply interested her. Feeling proud
                     herself of the daring spirit, the iron will, the ready invention, which these
                     letters displayed, yet prouder of the affectionate heart, the true and generous
                     nature, it is not wonderful that Mrs. Oswald should have often read them, or at
                     least parts of them, to her constant friend and very frequent visitor, Mary
                     Grayson. Nor is it more strange that Mary, thus made to recognize in the most
                     pleasing man she had yet known, far more lofty claims to her admiration, should
                     have enshrined him in her young and pure imagination as some "bright,
                     particular star."</p>
                  <p>Two years in the future! How almost interminable seems the prospect to our
                     hopes or our affections!—but let Time turn his perspective glass—let us look at
                     it in the past, and how it shrinks and becomes as a day in the history of our
                     lives. So was it with Philip Oswald's two years of absence, when he found
                     himself, in the earliest dawn of the spring of 1838, once more in New-York. Yet
                     that time had not passed without leaving traces of its passage—traces in the
                     changes affecting those around him—yet deeper traces in himself. He arrived in
                     the afternoon of an earlier day than that on which he had been expected. In the
                     evening Mrs. Oswald persuaded him to assume, for the gratification of her
                     curiosity, the picturesque costume worn by him in his western home. He had just
                     re-entered her room, and she was yet engaged in animated observation of the
                     hunting-shirt, strapped around the waist with a belt of buckskin, the open
                     collar, and loosely knotted cravat, which, as the mother's heart whispered, so
                     well became that tall and manly form, when there was a slight tap at the door,
                     and before she could speak, it opened, and Mary Grayson stood within it. She
                     gazed in silence for a moment on the striking figure before her, and her mind
                     rapidly scanned the changes which time and new modes of life had made in the
                     Philip Oswald of her memory. As she did so, she acknowledged<pb n="64-65"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000038"/> ledged that the embrowned face and hands, the
                     broader and more vigorous proportions, and even the easy freedom of his dress,
                     were more in harmony with the bold and independent aspect which his character
                     had assumed, than the delicacy and elegance which had formerly distinguished
                     him. His outer man was now the true index of a noble, free, and energetic
                     spirit—a spirit which, having conquered itself, was victor over all—and as
                     such, it attracted from Mary a deeper and more reverent admiration, than she
                     had felt for him when adorned with all the trappings of wealth and luxurious
                     refinement. The very depth of this sentiment destroyed the ease of her manner
                     towards him, and as Philip Oswald took the hand formerly so freely offered him,
                     and heard from her lips the respectful Mr. Oswald, instead of the frank,
                     sisterly Philip, he said to himself—"She looks down upon the backwoodsman, and
                     would have him know his place." So much for man's boasted penetration!</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the barrier of reserve thus erected between them, Philip Oswald
                     could not but admire the rare loveliness into which Mary Grayson's girlish
                     prettiness had expanded, and again, and yet again, while she was speaking to
                     his mother, and could not therefore perceive him, he turned to gaze on her,
                     fascinated not by the finely turned form or beautiful features, but by the
                     countenance beaming with gentle and refined intelligence. Here was none of the
                     brilliancy which had dazzled his senses in Caroline Danby, but an expression of
                     mind and heart far more captivating to him who had entered into the inner
                     mysteries of life.</p>
                  <p>A fortnight was the limit of Philip Oswald's stay in the city. He had come not
                     for his mother, but for the house in which she was to live, and he carried it
                     back with him. We do not mean that his house, with all its conveniences of
                     kitchen and pantry, its elegancies of parlor and drawing-room, and its
                     decorations of pillar and cornice fitly joined together, travelled off with him
                     to the far West. We do not despair of seeing such a feat performed some day,
                     but we believe it has not yet been done, and Philip Oswald, at least, did not
                     attempt it; he took with him, however, all those useful and ornamental
                     contrivances in their several parts, accompanied by workmen skilled in putting
                     the whole together. Again in his western home, for another year, his head and
                     his hands were fully occupied with building and planting. For the first two
                     years of his forest life, he had thought only of the substantial produce of the
                     field—the rye, the barley, the Indian corn, which were to be exchanged for the
                     "omnipotent dollar"—but woman was coming, and beauty and grace must be the
                     herald of her steps. For his mother, he planted fruits and flowers, opened
                     views of the lake, made a gravelled walk to its shore bordered with flowering
                     shrubs, and wreathed the woodbine, the honeysuckle, and the multiflora rose
                     around the columns of his piazza. For his mother this was done, and yet, when
                     the labors of the day were over, and he looked forth upon them in the cool,
                     still evening hour, it was not his mother's face, but one younger and fairer
                     which peered out upon him from the vine-leaves, or with tender smiles wooed him
                     to the lake. Young, fair, and tender as it was, its wooings generally sent him
                     in an opposite direction, with a sneer at his own folly, to stifle his fancies
                     with a book, or to mark out the plan of the morrow's operations.</p>
                  <p>More than a year had passed away and Philip Oswald was again in New-York, just
                     as spring was gliding into the ardent embraces of summer. This time he had come
                     for his mother, and with all the force of his resolute will, he shut his ears
                     to the flattering suggestions of fancy that a dearer pleasure than even<pb
                        n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7156-00000039"/> that mother's presence might be won.
                     He had looked steadily upon his lot in life, and he accepted it and determined
                     to make the best of it, and to be happy in it; yet he felt that it was after
                     all a rugged lot. Without considering all women as mercenary as Caroline Danby,
                     which his knowledge of his mother forbade him to do, even in his most
                     woman-scorning mood, he yet doubted whether any of those who had been reared
                     amid the refinements of cultivated life could be won to leave them all for love
                     in the western wilds; and as the unrefined could have no charms for him, he
                     deliberately embraced <emph>bachelordom</emph> as a part of his portion, and,
                     not without a sigh, yielded himself to the conviction that all the wealth of
                     woman's love within his power to attain, was locked within a mother's
                     heart.</p>
                  <p>A fortnight was again the allotted time of Philip Oswald's stay; but when that
                     had expired, he was persuaded to delay his departure for yet another week. He
                     had been drawn, by accompanying his mother in her farewell visits, once more
                     within the vortex of society, and his manly independence and energy, his
                     knowledge of what was to his companions a new world, and his spirit-stirring
                     descriptions of its varied beauty and inexhaustible fertility, made him more
                     the fashion than he had ever been. He had often met Caroline Danby—now Mrs.
                     Randall—and Mary more than once delicately turned her eyes away from her
                     cousin's face, lest she should read there somewhat of chagrin as Mr. Randall,
                     with his meaningless face and dapper-looking form—insignificant in all save the
                     reputation of being the wealthiest banker in Wall-street, and possessing the
                     most elegant house and furniture, the best appointed equipage, and the
                     handsomest wife in the city—stood beside Philip Oswald with<q>

                        </lg>
                     </q> and a face radiant with intelligence, while circled by an attentive
                     auditory of that which was noblest and best in their world, his eloquent
                     enthusiasm made them hear the rushing waters, see the boundless prairies, and
                     feel for a time all the wild freedom of the untamed West Such enthusiasm was
                     gladly welcomed as a breeze in the still air, a ruffle in the stagnant waters
                     of fashionable life.</p>
                  <p>Within two or three days of their intended departure, Mrs. Oswald proposed to
                     Philip that they should visit a friend residing near Fort Lee, and invited Mary
                     to accompany them. Among the acquaintances whom they found on board was an
                     invalid lady, who could not bear the fresh air upon deck; and Mary, pitying her
                     loneliness and seclusion, remained for a while conversing with her in the
                     cabin. Mrs. Oswald and Philip were on deck, and near them was a young and giddy
                     girl, to whose care a mother had intrusted a bold, active, joyous infant,
                     seemingly about eight months old.</p>
                  <p>"That is a dangerous position for so lively a child," said Philip Oswald to the
                     young nurse, as he saw her place him on the side of the boat; "he may spring
                     from your arms overboard."</p>
                  <p>With that foolish tempting of the danger pointed out by another, which we
                     sometimes see even in women, the girl removed her arms from around the child,
                     sustaining only a slight hold of its frock. At this moment, the flag of the
                     boat floated within view of the little fellow, and he sprang towards it. A
                     splash in the water told the rest—but even before that was heard, Philip<pb
                        n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7156-00000040"/> Oswald had dashed off his boots and
                     coat, and the poor child had scarcely touched the waves when he was beside it
                     and held it encircled in his arm.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Mary! Mr. Oswald! Mr. Oswald!" cried one of Mary's young acquaintances,
                     rushing into the cabin with a face blanched with terror.</p>
                  <p>"What of him?" questioned Mary, starting eagerly forward.</p>
                  <p>"He is in the water. Oh, Mary! he will be drowned."</p>
                  <p>Mary did not utter a sound, yet she felt in that moment for the first time, how
                     important to her was Philip Oswald's life. Tottering towards the door, she
                     leaned against it for a moment while all around grew dark, and strange sounds
                     were buzzing in her ears. The next instant she sank into a chair and lost her
                     terrors in unconsciousness. The same young lady who had played the alarmist to
                     her, as she saw the paleness of death settle on Mary's face and her eyes close,
                     ran again upon the deck, exclaiming "Mary Grayson is fainting,—pray come to
                     Mary Grayson."</p>
                  <p>Philip Oswald was already on deck, dripping indeed, but unharmed and looking
                     nobler than ever, as he held the recovered child in his arms. As that cry "Mary
                     Grayson is fainting" reached his ears, he threw the infant to a bystander, and
                     hastened to the cabin followed by Mrs. Oswald.</p>
                  <p>"What has caused this?" cried Mrs. Oswald as she saw Mary still insensible,
                     supported on the bosom of her invalid friend.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Ladson's precipitation," said the invalid, looking not very pleasantly on
                     that young lady; "she told her Mr. Oswald was drowning."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I am sure I thought he was drowning."</p>
                  <p>"If he had been, it would have been a pity to give such information so
                     abruptly," said Mrs. Oswald, as she took off Mary's bonnet and loosed the scarf
                     which was tied around her neck.</p>
                  <p>"I am sure," exclaimed Miss Ladson, anxious only to secure herself from
                     blame,—"I am sure I did not suppose Mary would faint; for when her uncle's
                     horse threw him, and every body thought he was killed, instead of fainting she
                     ran out in the street, and did more for him than any body else could do. I am
                     sure I could not think she would care more for Mr. Oswald's danger than for her
                     own uncle's."</p>
                  <p>No one replied to this insinuation; but that Philip Oswald heard it, might have
                     been surmised from the sudden flush that rose to his temples, and from his
                     closer clasp of the unconscious form, which at his mother's desire he was
                     bearing to a settee. Whether it was the water which oozed from his saturated
                     garments over her face and neck, or some subtle magnetic fluid conveyed in that
                     tender clasp, that aroused her, we cannot tell; but a faint tinge of color
                     revisited her cheeks and lips, and as Philip laid her tenderly down, while his
                     arms were still around her, and his face was bending over her, she opened her
                     eyes. What there was in that first look which called such a sudden flash of joy
                     into Philip Oswald's eyes, we know not; nor what were the whispered words
                     which, as he bowed his head yet lower, sent a crimson glow into Mary's pale
                     cheeks. This however we do know, that Mrs. Oswald and her son delayed their
                     journey for yet another week; and that the day before their departure Philip
                     Oswald stood with Mary Grayson at his side before God's holy altar, and there,
                     in the presence of his mother, Mr. Danby, Mr. and Mrs. Randall, and a few
                     friends, they took those vows which made them one for ever.</p>
                  <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7156-00000041"/>
                  <p>Does some starched prude, or some lady interested in the bride's <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">trousseau,</foreign> exclaim against such unseemly haste? We
                     have but one excuse for them. They were so unfashionable as to prefer the
                     gratification of a true affection to the ceremonies so dear to vanity, and to
                     think more of the earnest claims of life than of its gilded pomps.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Danby had been unable to pay down the bride's small dower of $8000; and
                     when he called on his son-in-law, Mr. Randall, to assist him, he could only
                     offer to indorse his note to Mr. Oswald for the amount, acknowledging that it
                     would be perilous at that time to abstract even half that amount from his
                     business. It probably would have been perilous indeed, as in little more than a
                     month after he failed for an enormous amount; but fear not, reader, for the
                     gentle Caroline; she still retained her elegant house and furniture, her
                     handsome equipage and splendid jewels. These were only a small part of what the
                     indignant creditors found had been made over to her by her grateful
                     husband.</p>
                  <p>Six years have passed away since the occurrence of the events we have been
                     recording. Caroline Randall, weary of the sameness of splendor in her home, has
                     been abroad for two years, travelling with a party of friends. It is
                     said—convenient phrase that—that her husband has declared she must and shall
                     return, and that to enforce his will he has resolved to send her no more
                     remittances, to honor no more of her drafts, as she has already almost beggared
                     him by her extravagance abroad. Verily, she has her reward!</p>
                  <p>One farewell glance at our favorite, Mary Grayson, and we have done.</p>
                  <p>Beside a lovely lake, over whose margin light graceful shrubs are bending, and
                     on whose transparent waters lie the dense forest shadows, though here and there
                     the golden rays of the declining sun flash through the tangled boughs upon its
                     dancing waves, a noble-looking boy of four years old is sailing his mimic
                     fleet, while a lovely girl, two years younger, toddles about, picking "pitty
                     flowers," and bringing them to "papa, mamma, or grandmamma," as her capricious
                     fancy prompts. Near by, papa, mamma, grandmamma, and one pleased and honored
                     guest, are grouped beneath the bending boughs of a magnificent black walnut,
                     and around a table on which strawberries and cream, butter sweet as the breath
                     of the cows that yielded it, biscuits light and white, and bread as good as
                     Humbert himself could make, are served in a style of elegant simplicity, while
                     the silver urn in which the water hisses, and the small china cups into which
                     the fragrant tea is poured, if they are somewhat antique in fashion, are none
                     the less beautiful or the less valued by those who still prize the slightest
                     object associated with the affections beyond the gratification of the
                     vanity.</p>
                  <p>The evening meal is over. The shadows grow darker on the lake. Agreeable
                     conversation has given place to silent enjoyment, which Mrs. Oswald interrupts
                     to say, "Philip, this is the hour for music; let us have some before Mary
                     leaves us with the children."</p>
                  <p>Full, deep-toned was the manly voice that swelled upon that evening air, and
                     soft and clear its sweet accompaniment, while the words, full of adoring
                     gratitude and love, seemed incense due to the Heaven which had so blessed
                     them.</p>
                  <p>The last sweet notes have died away, and Mary, calling the children, leads them
                     away, after they have bestowed their goodnight kisses. Philip Oswald follows
                     her with his eyes, as, with a child on either hand, she advances with gentle
                     grace up the easy<pb n="72" xml:id="VAC7156-00000042"/> slope, to the house on
                     its summit. She enters the piazza, and is screened from his view by its
                     lattice-work of vines, but he knows that soon his children will be lisping
                     their evening prayer at her knee, and the thought calls a tenderer expression
                     to his eyes as he turns them away from his "sweet home."</p>
                  <p>Contrast this picture with that of Caroline Randall's heartless splendor, and
                     say whether thou wilt choose for thy portion the gratification of the true and
                     pure household affections which Heaven has planted in thy nature, or that of a
                     selfish vanity?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>THIS morning, as I sat in the library writing a letter, Annie came in and seated
                  herself at a table on the opposite side of the room. Her unusual stillness caused
                  me to look up after some minutes, and I found that Mr. Arlington's portfolio
                  having been left upon the table, she had drawn from it one of his pencillings, and
                  was gazing steadfastly upon it, as I could not but think, with something troubled
                  in the expression of her usually open and cheerful face. While I was still
                  observing her, the door behind her opened, and Mr. Arlington himself entered. A
                  blush rose to Annie's cheeks as she saw him; a blush which had its origin, I
                  thought, in some deeper feeling than a mere girlish shame at being found so
                  engrossed by one of his productions.</p>
               <p>"What have you there?" he asked, as seating himself beside her, he took the paper
                  from what seemed to me her somewhat reluctant hand. No sooner had he looked on it,
                  than his own bright face became shadowed, as hers had been, and yet he smiled,
                  too, as he said, "That portfolio is really an <foreign xml:lang="LAT">omnium
                     gatherum.</foreign> I had no idea this had found its way there. When I first
                  read Mrs. Hemans's poem of 'The Bird's Release,' it reminded me of this scene of
                  my boyhood, though if I have never spoken to you of my darling Grace, you will not
                  be able to understand why."</p>
               <p>"You never have," said Annie, answering his looks rather<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC7156-00000045"/> than his words, while a slight increase of color
                  was again perceptible in her fair cheek.</p>
               <p>"She was my sister, my only sister; we were but two, the petted darlings of a
                  widowed mother. I told you, that few could sympathize as I could, with Körner's
                  memory of Mother-love. I was but six years old, and just such a chubby,
                  broad-shouldered little varlet, I fancy, as I have sketched here, when Grace, who
                  was two years older, and the loveliest, merriest little creature in the world,
                  died. My mother was already beginning to feel the influence of that disease,
                  which, two years later, terminated her life, and, I have no doubt, the death of
                  Grace, who was her idol, increased the rapidity of its progress."</p>
               <p>There was silence for some minutes, and then Annie said softly, "But what of the

               <p>"It was a thrush which had been given to Grace some time before her death, and
                  which she was trying to tame for me. My mother could not bear to see it after her
                  death, and with some difficulty persuaded me to give it its liberty. You will now
                  see why I should have dedicated this sketch to Grace, and why these lines should
                  have brought the scene to my mind, and caused me indeed to make this drawing of
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Will you read the lines for me?" asked Annie, "I had not finished them when you
                  took the paper from me."</p>
               <p>To tell you a secret, reader, I do not believe she had seen any thing on the paper
                  except the few words in German text, written at its head, "To my darling
                  Grace."</p>
               <p>Mr. Arlington read in a tone of feeling and interest,</p>

                  <p>I was doubtful whether either Mr. Arlington or Annie were aware of my presence,
                     and was just debating with myself whether I should make them aware of it by
                     addressing them, or quietly steal away, when Col. Donaldson decided the point
                     by entering the library and speaking to me. He came to ask that I would come to
                     the parlor and see a boy who had just been sent to him from one of our
                     charitable institutions, to which he had applied for a lad to act as a helper
                     to his old waiter, John, who was now old enough to require some indulgence, and
                     had always been trustworthy enough to deserve some. The boy looked intelligent
                     and honest—he was neat in his person and active in his movements.</p>
                  <p>"He is an orphan," said Col. Donaldson, "and the managers of the institution
                     have offered to bind him to me for seven years, or till he is of age. What do
                     you think of it?"</p>
                  <p>"If the boy himself is willing, I should be glad to know he was so well
                     provided for," I replied; "though, in general, no abolitionist can be more
                     vehemently opposed to negro slavery than I am to this apprenticeship business.
                     What is it but a slavery of the worst description. The master is endowed with
                     irresponsible power without the interest in the well-being of his slave, which
                     the planter, the actual owner of slaves, ordinarily feels."</p>
                  <p>"You speak strongly," said Col. Donaldson.</p>
                  <p>"I feel strongly on this subject," I answered. "I knew one instance of the
                     effects of this system which I have often thought of publishing to the world,
                     as speaking more powerfully against it than a thousand addresses could do."</p>
                  <p>"Tell it to us, Aunt Nancy," said Robert Dudley.</p>
                  <p>"It is too long to tell now," said I, as the dinner-bell sounded.</p>
                  <p>"Then let us have it this evening," urged Col. Donaldson—"for it is a subject
                     in which I am much interested."</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, in the evening, I gave them the "o'er true tale" of</p>

                  <p>"IN the blue summer ocean, far off and alone," lies a little island, known to
                     mariners in the Pacific only for the fine water with which it supplies them,
                     and for the bold shore which makes it possible for ships of considerable
                     tonnage to lie in quiet near the land. Discovered at first by accident, it has
                     been long, for these reasons, visited both by English and American whalers. A
                     few years since, and no trace of man's presence could be found there beyond the
                     belt of rocks, amid which rose the springs that were the chief, and indeed only
                     attraction the island presented to the rough, hardy men who had visited it. But
                     within that stony<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7156-00000047"/> girdle lay a
                     landscape soft and lovely as any that rose within the tropical seas. There the
                     plantain waved its leafy crown, the orange shed its rich perfume, and bore its
                     golden fruit aloft upon the desert air, and the light, feathery foliage of the
                     tamarind moved gracefully to the touch of the dallying breeze. All was green
                     and soft and fair, for there no winter chills the life of nature, but, <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was a scene which might have seemed created for the abode of some being too
                     bright and good for the common earth of common men, or for some Hinda and
                     Hafed, who, driven from a world all too harsh and evil for their nobler
                     natures, might have found in it a refuge, <q>

                  <p>Alas for the dream of the poet! This beautiful island became the refuge not of
                     pure and loving hearts, but of one from whose nature cruel tyranny seemed to
                     have blotted out every feeling and every faculty save hatred and fear; and he
                     who first introduced into its yet untainted solitudes the bitter sorrows and
                     dark passions of humanity, was a child, who, but ten years before, had lain in
                     all the loveliness of sinless infancy upon a mother's bosom. Of that mother's
                     history he knew nothing—whether her sin or only her sorrows had thrown him
                     fatherless upon the world, he was ignorant—he only had a dim memory of gentle
                     eyes, which had looked on him as no others had ever done, and of a low, sweet
                     voice speaking to him such words as he had never heard from any other. He had
                     been loved, and that love had made his life of penury, in a humble hovel in
                     England, bright and beautiful; but his mother had passed away from earth, and
                     with her all the light of his existence. Child as he was, the succeeding
                     darkness preserved long in brightness the memory of the last look from her fast
                     glazing eyes, the last words from her dying lips, the last touch of her already
                     death-cold hand. She died, and the same reluctant charity which consigned her
                     to a pauper's grave, gave to her boy a dwelling in the parish poor-house. With
                     the tender mercies of such institutions the author of Oliver Twist has made the
                     world acquainted. They were such in the present case, that the poor little
                     Edward Hallett welcomed as the first glad words that had fallen on his ears for
                     two long, weary years, the news that he was to be bound apprentice to a captain
                     sailing from Portsmouth in a whaling ship. He learned rather from what was said
                        <emph>near</emph> him, than <emph>to</emph> him, that this man wanted a
                     cabin boy, but would not have one who was not bound to him, or to use the more
                     expressive language in which it reached the ears of his destined victim, "one
                     with whom he could not do as he pleased."</p>
                  <p>He who had come within the poor-house walls at six years old, a glad,
                     rosy-cheeked, chubby child, went from them at eight, thin, and pale, and grave,
                     with a frame broken by want and labor, a mind clouded, and a heart repressed by
                     unkindness. But, sad as was the history of those years, the succeeding two
                     taught the poor boy to regard them as the vanished brightness of a dream. The
                     man—we should more justly say, the fiend—to whom the next fourteen years of his
                     life were by bond devoted, was a savage by nature, and had been rendered yet
                     more brutal by habits of intoxication. In his drunken orgies, his favorite
                     pastime was to torture the unfortunate being whom the "guardians of the<pb
                        n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7156-00000048"/> poor" of an English parish had placed
                     in his power. It would make the heart of the reader sick, were we to attempt a
                     detail of the many horrible inventions by which this modern Caligula amused his
                     leisure hours, and made life hideous to his victim. Nor was it only from this
                     arch fiend that the poor boy suffered. Mate, cook, and sailors, soon found in
                     him a butt for their jokes, an object on which they might safely vent their
                     ill-humor, and a convenient cover for their own delinquencies.</p>
                  <p>He was beaten for and by them. The evil qualities which man had himself
                     elicited from his nature, if not implanted there—the sullenness, and hardiness,
                     and cunning he evinced, were made an excuse for further injury. During his
                     first voyage of eighteen months, spite of all this, hope was not entirely dead
                     in his heart. The ship was to return to England, and he determined to run away
                     from her, and find his way back to the poor-house. It was a miserable refuge,
                     but it was his only one. He escaped—he found his way there through many
                     dangers—he told his story. It was heard with incredulity, and he was returned
                     to his tormentors, to learn that there is even in hell "a deeper hell."</p>
                  <p>Again he went on a whaling voyage. Day after day the fathomless, the seemingly
                     illimitable sea, the image of the Infinite, was around him—but his darkened
                     mind saw in it only a prison, which shut him in with his persecutors. Night
                     after night the stars beamed peacefully above him? luring his thoughts upward,
                     but he saw in them only the signals of drunken revelry to others, and of deeper
                     woe to himself. There was but one wish in his heart—it had almost ceased to be
                     a hope—to escape from man; to live and die where he should never see his form,
                     never hear his voice. The ship encountered a severe storm. She was driven from
                     her course, her voyage lengthened, and some of her watercasks casks stove in.
                     They made for an island, not far distant, by the chart, to take in a fresh
                     supply of water. Edward Hallett heard the sailors say to each other that this
                     island was uninhabited, and his wish grew into a passionate desire—a hope. For
                     the completion of this hope, he had but one resource—the sword and the shield
                     of the feeble—cunning; and well he exercised it.</p>
                  <p>The ship lay within a quarter of a mile of the shore, and a boat was sent up to
                     procure water—one man remaining always, to fill the empty vessels, while the
                     others returned to the ship with those already filled. The best means of
                     accomplishing his purpose, that occurred to the poor boy, was to feign the
                     utmost degree of terror at the lonely and unprotected situation of this man
                     during the absence of his comrades. He spoke his terrors where he knew they
                     would be heard by the prime author of his miseries. The result was what he had
                     anticipated.</p>
                  <p>"Ye're afraid, are ye, of being left there by yerself? Ye'd rather be whipped,
                     or tied up by the thumbs, or be kept at the mast-head all night, would ye?
                     Then, dam'me, that's just what I'll do to you. Here, hold on with that
                     boat—take this youngster with you, and you can bring back Tom, and leave him to
                     fill the casks for you."</p>
                  <p>Well did the object of his tyranny act his part. He entreated, he adjured all
                     around him to save him from so dreaded a fate—in vain, of course—for his
                     affected agonies but riveted the determination of his tyrant. It was a new
                     delight to see him writhe in agony, and strive to draw back from those who were
                     urging him to the boat. He was forced in, borne to the island, and left to his
                     task. But this was not enough. He could not escape in the broad light of day,
                     from a spot directly under the eyes of his tormentors, while between him and
                     the ship a boat was ever coming<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7156-00000049"/> and
                     going. Through the day he must persist in the part he had assumed. He did not
                     fail to continue it, and when the day approached its close, he sent to the ship
                     the most urgent entreaties that he might be allowed to return there before it
                     was night. The sailors, rough and hard as they generally were to him,
                     sympathized with his agony of fear, and asked that he might return; but his
                     demon was now inflamed by drink, and every word in favor of his petition
                     insured its rejection. He even made the unusual exertion of going up himself in
                     the last boat, that he might see the victim of his malice, and feast his ears
                     with the cries and objurgations which terror would wring from him.</p>
                  <p>"If we should forget you in the morning, you can take the next homeward bound
                     ship that stops here, but don't tell your friends at the poor-house too bad a
                     tale, of us," were the parting words of this wretch.</p>
                  <p>Darkness and silence were around the desolate boy, but they brought no fear
                     with them. Man, his enemy, was not there. He saw not the beauty of the heavens,
                     from which the stars looked down on him in their unchanged serenity, or of the
                     earth, where flowers were springing at his feet, and graceful shrubs were
                     waving over him. He heard not the deep-toned sea uttering its solemn music, or
                     the breeze whispering its softer notes in his ear. He only saw the ship, the
                     abode of men, fading into indistinctness, as the darkness threw its veil over
                     it; he only heard the voice in his heart, proclaiming ever and again, "I am
                     free." Before the morrow dawned, he had surmounted the rocks at the
                     landing-place, and wandered on with no aim, but to put as great a distance as
                     possible between him and the ship. Two hours' walking brought him again to the
                     sea, in an opposite direction to that by which he had approached the island.
                     Here he crawled into a hiding-place, amongst the rocks, and lay down to rest.
                     The day was again declining before he ventured forth from his covert, and
                     cautiously approached the distant shore, from whence he might see the ship. He
                     reached the spring by which he had stood yester eve, when his companions parted
                     from him, with something like pity stirring in the hearts of all but one among
                     them. Fearfully he looked around—before him—but no shadow on the earth, no sail
                     upon the pathless sea, told of man's presence. He was alone—alone indeed, for
                     the beauty of Nature roused no emotion in his withered heart, and he held no
                     communion with Nature's God. His was indeed an orphaned soul. Could he have
                     loved, had it been but a simple flower, he would have felt something of the joy
                     of life; but the very power of love seemed to have been crushed from his heart,
                     by years of cold neglect and harsh unkindness.</p>
                  <p>Weeks, months passed, without any event that might awaken the young solitary
                     from his torpor. By day, he roved through the island, or lay listlessly under
                     the shadow of a tree; by night, he slept beneath the rocks which had first
                     sheltered him; while the fruits, that grew and ripened without his care, gave
                     him food. Thus he lived a merely animal life, his strongest sensation one of
                     satisfaction for his relief from positive suffering, but with nothing that
                     could be called joy in the present, and with no hope for the future; one to
                     whom God had given an immortal spirit, capable of infinite elevation in the
                     scale of intelligence and happiness, and whom man had pressed down to—aye,
                     below the level of the brutes, which sported away their brief existence at his
                     side. Such tyranny as he had experienced, is rare; but its results may well
                     give an impressive, a fearful lesson, to those to whom are committed the
                     destinies of a being unconnected with them by any of<pb n="84-85"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000050"/> those ties which awaken tenderness, and call
                     forth indulgence in the sternest minds. Let them beware, lest the "iron rule"
                     crush out the life of the young heart, and darken the intellect by
                     extinguishing the light of hope.</p>
                  <p>Terrible was the retribution which his crimes wrought out for the author of our
                     young hero's miseries. When he received the intelligence from the men whom he
                     had sent in the morning to bring him from the island, that he was nowhere to be
                     found, he read in their countenances what his own heart was ready to repeat to
                     him, that he was his murderer; for neither they nor he doubted that the
                     terrified boy had rushed into the sea, and been drowned in the effort to escape
                     the horrors raised by his wild and superstitious fancy. From that hour his
                     persecutor suffered tortures as great as his bitterest enemies could have
                     desired to inflict on him. The images which drove him with increased eagerness
                     to the bottle, became more vivid and terrific under the influence of
                     intoxication. He drank deeper and deeper, in the vain hope to banish them, and
                     died ere many months had passed, shouting, in his last moments, alternate
                     prayers and curses to the imagined form of him whom he supposed the hope of
                     revenge had conjured from the ocean grave to which his cruelties had consigned
                     him.</p>
                  <p>Five months passed over Edward Hallett, in the dead calm of an existence
                     agitated by neither hope nor fear. The calm was broken one evening, by the
                     sight of a seaman, drawing water from the spring which had brought his former
                     companions to the island. As he came in sight, the man turned his head, and
                     stood for an instant, spell-bound by the unexpected vision of a human being on
                     that island, whose matted locks and tattered garments spoke the extreme of
                     misery. There was only one hope for the sad, wild boy—it was in flight—and
                     turning, he ran swiftly back; but the path was strewn with rocks, and, in his
                     haste, he stumbled and fell. In a moment his pursuer stood beside him,
                     exclaiming, in a coarse, but kindly meant language:—</p>
                  <p>"What the devil are you runnin' away from me for, youngster?—I'm sure I
                     wouldn't hurt ye—but get up, and tell us what you're doing here, and where
                     ye've come from."</p>
                  <p>The speaker attempted, while addressing the boy, to raise him from the ground,
                     but he resisted all his efforts, and met all his questioning with sullen
                     silence.</p>
                  <p>"By the powers, I'm thinking I've caught a wild man. I wonder if there's any
                     more of 'em. If I can only get this one aboard, he'll make my fortune. I'll try
                     for it, any how, and offer the capting to go shares with my bargain;" and he
                     proceeded to lift the slight form of the pauper boy in his brawny arms, and
                     bear him to the boat, which, during this scene, had approached the shore. One
                     who had had less experience of the iron nature of man, would have endeavored,
                     in Edward Hallett's circumstances, to move his captor, by entreaties, to leave
                     him to his dearly prized freedom; but he had long believed, with the poet, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"There is no pulse in man's obdurate heart—</l>
                           <l>It does not feel for man;"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> and after the first wild struggle, which had only served to show that he
                     was an infant in the hands of the strong seaman, he abandoned himself to his
                     fate, in silent despair. With closed eyes and lips, he suffered himself,
                     without a movement, to be borne to the boat, and deposited in it, amid the many
                     uncouth and characteristic exclamations of his captor and his companions, who
                     would not be convinced that it was really a child of the human race, thus
                     strangely found on this isolated spot. Hastily they bore him to<pb n="86-87"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000051"/> the ship, which, the providence of God had sent,
                     under the guidance of a kind and noble spirit, for the salvation of this, his
                     not forgotten, though long tried creature.</p>
                  <p>Captain Durbin, of the barque Good Intent, was one who combined, in an unusual
                     degree, the qualities of boldness and energy with the kindest, the tenderest,
                     and most generous feelings. These were wrought into beautiful harmony, by the
                     Christian principles which had long governed his life, and from which he had
                     learned to be, at the same time, "diligent in business" and "kindly
                     affectioned"—to have no <emph>fear</emph> of man, and to love his brother, whom
                     he had seen, as the best manifestation of devotion to God, whom he had not
                     seen. Perhaps he had escaped the usual effect of his rough trade, in hardening
                     the manners, at least, by the influence on him of his only child, a little
                     girl, now six years old, who was his constant companion, even in his voyages.
                     Little Emily Durbin had lost her mother when she was only two years old. The
                     circumstances of her own childhood had wrought into the mind of the dying Mrs.
                     Durbin, the conviction that only a parent is a fitting guardian for a child. To
                     all argument on this subject she would reply, "It seems to me that God has put
                     so much love into a parent's heart, Only that he may bear with all a child's
                     waywardness, which other people can't be expected to bear with."</p>
                  <p>True to her principles, she had exacted a promise from her husband, in her
                     dying hour, that he would never part from their Emily. The promise had been
                     sacredly kept.</p>
                  <p>"I will retire from sea as soon as I have enough to buy a place on shore, for
                     Emily's sake; but till then, her home must be in my cabin. She is under God's
                     care there, as well as on shore, and perhaps it would be better for her, if I
                     am lost at sea, to share my fate," Captain Durbin would say to the well-meant
                     remonstrances of his friends.</p>
                  <p>Emily had a little hammock slung beside his own—the books in which he taught
                     her made a large part of his library, and he who had seen her kneel beside her
                     father to lisp her childish prayer, or who had heard the simple, beautiful
                     faith with which she commended herself to the care of her Father in Heaven,
                     when the waves roared and the winds howled around her floating home, would have
                     felt, perhaps, that the most important end of life, the cultivation of those
                     affections that connect us with God and with our fellow-creatures, might be
                     attained as perfectly there as elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>The astonishment of Captain Durbin and the pity of his gentle child may be
                     conceived, at the sight of the poor boy, who was brought up from the boat by
                     his captor and owner, as he considered himself, and laid at their feet, while
                     they sat together in their cabin—he writing in his log-book, and she conning
                     her evening lesson. To the proposition that he should give the prize so
                     strangely obtained a free passage, and share in the advantages to be gained by
                     its exhibition in America, Captain Durbin replied by showing the disappointed
                     seaman the impossibility of the object of these speculations being some product
                     of Nature's freaks—some hitherto unknown animal, with the form, but without the
                     faculties of man.</p>
                  <p>"Do you not see that he has clothes——"</p>
                  <p>"Clothes, do ye call them?" interrupted the blunt sailor, touching the pieces
                     of cloth that hung around, but no longer covered the thin limbs.</p>
                  <p>"Rags, perhaps I had better say—but the rags have been clothes, woven and sewn
                     by man's hands—so he must have lived<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7156-00000052"/>
                     among men—civilized men—and he has grown little as you may perceive, since
                     those clothes were made—therefore, he cannot have been long on the island."</p>
                  <p>"But how did he get there? Who'd leave a baby like this there by himself?"</p>
                  <p>"That we may never know, for the boy must either be an idiot—which he does not
                     look like, however—or insane, or dumb—but let that be as it will, we will do
                     our duty by him, and I thank God for having sent us here in time to save
                     him."</p>
                  <p>The master of the ship usually gives the tone to those whom he commands, and
                     Captain Durbin found no difficulty in obtaining the help of his men in his kind
                     intentions to the boy so strangely brought amongst them. By kind, but rough
                     hands, he was washed, his hair was cut and combed, and a suit of clean, though
                     coarse garments, hastily fitted to him by the best tailor among them—fitted,
                     not with the precision of Stultz certainly, but sufficiently well to enable him
                     to walk in them without danger of walking on them or of leaving them behind.
                     But he showed no intention of availing himself of these capabilities. Wherever
                     they carried him he went without resistance—wherever they placed him he
                     remained—he ate the food that was offered him—but no word escaped his lips, no
                     voluntary movement was made by him, no look marked his consciousness of aught
                     that passed before him. He had again assumed his only shield from
                     violence—cunning. He could account in no way for his being left unmolested,
                     except from the belief, freely expressed before him, that nature, by depriving
                     him of intelligence, or of speech, had unfitted him for labor, and he resolved
                     to do nothing that should unsettle that belief. But he found it more difficult
                     than he had supposed it would be to preserve this resolution, for he was
                     subjected to the action of a more potent influence than any he had yet
                     encountered—kindness. All were ready to show him this in its common forms, but
                     none so touchingly or so tenderly as the little Emily Durbin. It was a
                     beautiful sight to see that gentle child, with eyes blue as the heavens, whose
                     pure and lovely spirit they seemed to mirror, gazing up at the dark boy as if
                     she hoped to catch some ray of the awakening spirit flitting over the handsome
                     but stolid features. Sometimes she would sit beside him, take his hand in hers,
                     or stroke gently the dark locks that began again to hang in neglected curls
                     around his face, and speak to him in the tenderest accents, saying, "I love you
                     very much, pretty boy, and my father loves you too, and we all love you—don't
                     you love us?—but you can't tell me—I forgot that—never mind, I'll ask our
                     Heavenly Father to make you talk. Don't you know Jesus made the dumb to speak
                     when he was here on earth? Did you ever hear about it? Poor boy! you can't
                     answer me—but I'll tell you all about it:" and then in her sweet words and
                     pitying voice she would tell of the Saviour of men—how he had made the deaf to
                     hear and the dumb to speak, and she would repeat his lessons of love, dwelling
                     often on her favorite text, "This is my commandment, that ye love one
                     another—even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."</p>
                  <p>"Thus, by this babe, God was in his love leading the chilled heart of that
                     poor, desolate boy, back to himself—to hope—to Heaven. It was impossible that
                     the dew of mercy should thus, day by day and hour by hour distil upon a spirit
                     indurated by man's cruelties, without softening it. Edward Hallett began to
                     love that sweet child, to listen to her step and voice, to gaze upon her fair
                     face, to return her loving looks, and to long to tell her all his story. Emily
                     became aware of the new expression in his<pb n="90-91"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000053"/> face, and redoubled her manifestations of
                     interest. She entreated that he should be brought in when her father read the
                     Bible and prayed with her, night and morning. "Who knows—may be our Heavenly
                     Father will make him hear us," was her simple and pathetic response to Captain
                     Durbin's assurance that it was useless, as he either could not or would not
                     understand them. Never had Edward Hallett's resolution been more severely tried
                     than when he saw her kneel, with clasped hands and uplifted face, at her
                     father's knee, and heard her pray in her own simple words that "God would bless
                     the poor little dumb boy whom he had sent to them, and that he would make him
                     speak, and give him a good heart, that he might love them." Captain Durbin
                     turned his eyes upon the object of her prayer at that moment, and he almost
                     thought that his lips moved, and was quite certain that his eyes glistened with
                     emotion. From this time he was as anxious as Emily herself for the attendance
                     of the strange boy at their devotions.</p>
                  <p>For many weeks the ship had sped across that southern sea with light and
                     favoring breezes, but at length there came a storm. The heavens were black with
                     clouds—the wind swept furiously over the ocean, and drove its wild waves in
                     tremendous masses against the reeling ship. Captain Durbin was a bold sailor,
                     as we have said, and he had weathered many a storm in his trim, barque; but
                     Emily knew by the way in which he pressed her to his heart this night, before
                     he laid her, not in her hammock, but on the narrow floor of his state-room, and
                     by the tone in which he ejaculated, "God bless you, and take care of you, my
                     beloved child!"—that there was more danger to-night than they had ever before
                     encountered together; and as he was leaving her she drew him back and said,
                     "Father, I can't sleep, and I should like to talk to the little dumb boy; won't
                     you bring him here, and let him sit on my mattress with me?"</p>
                  <p>Captain Durbin brought Edward Hallett and placed him beside Emily, where, by
                     bracing themselves against the wall of the state-room, they might prevent their
                     being dashed about by the rolling of the vessel. Emily welcomed him with an
                     affectionate smile, and taking his hand, which now sometimes answered the clasp
                     of hers, told him that he must not be afraid, though there was a great storm,
                     for their Father in Heaven could deliver them out of it if it were his will,
                     and if it were not, he would take them to himself, if they loved him and loved
                     one another as the blessed Saviour had commanded them. "And you know we must
                     die some way," continued the sweet young preacher, "and father says it is just
                     as easy to go to Heaven from the sea as from any other place."—She paused a
                     moment, and then added in a lower tone, "But I think I had rather die on shore,
                     and be buried by my mother in the green, shady church-yard—it is so quiet
                     there."</p>
                  <p>Emily crept nearer and nearer to her young companion as she spoke, with that
                     clinging to human love and care which is felt by the hardest breast in moments
                     of dread. His heart was beating high with the tenderest and the happiest
                     emotions he had ever known, when a wave sweeping over the deck of the ship, and
                     breaking through the skylight, came tumbling in upon them. It forced them
                     asunder, and the falling of their lantern at the same moment left them in
                     darkness amidst the tossing of the ship, the rolling of the furniture, and the
                     noise of the many waters. Edward Hallett's first thought was for Emily;—he felt
                     for her on every side, but she was not in the state-room; he groped his way
                     into the cabin, but he could not find her, and he heard no sound that told of
                     her existence. In terror for her, self was forgotten—love conquered fear, as it
                     had already obtained the empire over<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7156-00000054"/>
                     hate, and he called her—"Emily—dear Emily!—hear me—answer me, Emily!"</p>
                  <p>He listened in vain for the sweet voice for which he thirsted. Suddenly he
                     bounded up the cabin steps and rushed to the post at which he knew Captain
                     Durbin was most likely to be found in such a scene, crying as he went, "Emily!
                     Emily! oh bring a light and look for Emily!"</p>
                  <p>The shrill cry of a human heart in agony was heard above the bellowing of the
                     winds and the rush of the waves, and without waiting for a question, without
                     heeding even the miracle that the dumb had spoken, Captain Durbin hastened
                     below, followed by his agitated summoner. As quickly as his trembling hands
                     permitted, he struck a light and looked around for his child. She had been
                     dashed against a chest, and lay pale and seemingly lifeless, with the red blood
                     oozing slowly from a cut in the temple. Edward Hallett had lifted her before
                     Captain Durbin could lay aside his light, and as he approached him, looking up
                     with a face almost as pale as that which lay upon his arm, he exclaimed, "Oh,
                     sir! surely she is not dead!"</p>
                  <p>It was not till Emily had again opened her soft eyes and assured her father
                     that she was not much hurt, that any notice was taken of the very unusual fact
                     of Edward Hallett's speaking.</p>
                  <p>"Father, how did you know I was hurt?"</p>
                  <p>"He whom we have thought a dumb boy called me, and told me he could not find
                     you," said Captain Durbin, looking earnestly, almost sternly at Edward, who
                     colored as he felt that eyes he dared not meet, were upon him. But the gentle,
                     loving Emily took his hand, and said, "Did our good Heavenly Father make you
                     speak—I am so glad—please speak to me!"</p>
                  <p>Edward could not raise his eyes to hers, but covering his face with his other
                     hand, he fell on his knees, saying to her and Captain Durbin, "I am afraid it
                     was very wicked, but indeed I couldn't help it. I could speak all the time,
                     Emily, but I was afraid of being beaten as I used to be, if I seemed like other
                     people—now if they beat me I must bear it—better for me to be beaten than to
                     have Emily lie there with no one to help her."</p>
                  <p>"But who is going to beat you? Nobody will beat you—we all love you—don't we,
                     father?" cried Emily, bending forward and putting her arm around the neck of
                     her protégé.</p>
                  <p>"We must hear first whether he is worthy of our love, my dear," said Captain
                     Durbin, as he attempted to withdraw his daughter's arm, and to make her lie
                     down again—but Edward had seized the little hand and held it around his neck,
                     while he exclaimed in the most imploring tones, "Oh, sir! let Emily love
                     me—nobody else except my poor mother ever loved me. Beat me as much as you
                     please, and I will not say a word, but oh! pray sir! don't tell Emily she must
                     not love me."</p>
                  <p>"And father, if he was wicked, you know you told me once that we must love the
                     wicked and try to do them good, because our Father in Heaven loved us while we
                     were yet sinners," urged Emily.</p>
                  <p>That gentle voice could not be unheeded, and as Captain Durbin kissed her, he
                     laid his hand kindly on the boy's head, saying in more friendly tones, "I hope
                     he has not been wicked, but we will hear more about it to-morrow—I cannot stay
                     longer with you now, and you must lie still just where I have put you, or you
                     may roll out and get hurt. We shall have a rough sea most of the night, though,
                     thank God! no danger, for the wind had shifted and slackened a little before
                     that great wave swept you away!"</p>
                  <p>"May I not stay by Emily, sir, and tell her what made me not speak? I will not
                     let her sit up again."</p>
                  <pb n="94" xml:id="VAC7156-00000055"/>
                  <p>"Oh, yes! do father, let him stay till you come down again."</p>
                  <p>Captain Durbin consented, and when he came down again at midnight, from the
                     deck, the children had both fallen asleep, but their hands were clasped in each
                     other, and the flushed cheeks and dewy lashes of both showed that they had been
                     weeping. The next morning Captain Durbin heard the story of the orphan boy.
                     Emily Durbin stood beside him while he told it, and he needed the courage which
                     her presence gave him, for his cowed spirit could not yet rise to confidence in
                     man. The mingled indignation and pity with which Captain Durbin heard the
                     simple but touching narrative of his life—the earnest kindness with which, at
                     the conclusion, he drew him to his side, and told him that he would be his
                     father, and Emily his sister, adding, "God gave you to me, and as His gift I
                     will love you and care for you," first taught him that his friend Emily was not
                     the one only angel of mercy in our world. As time passed on, and Captain Durbin
                     kept well the promise of those words, instructing him with care and guarding
                     him with tenderness as well as with fidelity, his faith became firm, not only
                     in his fellow-men, but in Him who had brought such great good for him out of
                     the darkest evil. His long repressed affections sprang into vigorous growth,
                     his intellect expanded rapidly in their glow, his eye grew bright, his step
                     elastic, and his whole air redolent of a joy which none but those who have
                     suffered as he had done can conceive. In the handsome youth who returned two
                     years afterwards with Captain Durbin to Boston, and who walked so proudly at
                     his side, leading Emily by the hand, few could have recognized the wild boy of
                     that western Island.</p>
                  <p>Such was the transformation which the spirit of love, breathing itself through
                     the lips of a little child, had effected. "Verily, of such" children "is the
                     kingdom of heaven."</p>

               <p>THE entertainment of the evening gave its character to our conversation on the
                  following morning. It was a conversation too grave for introduction into a work
                  intended only to aid in the entertainment of festive hours: it commenced with the
                  English "poor laws," and ended with a discussion of the tenure of property in that
                  land, and the wisdom of our own republican fathers in abolishing entails—a subject
                  affording a fair opportunity to us Americans, to indulge a little in that
                  self-glorification which we are accused of loving so well.</p>
               <p>"What a curious book would a 'History of Entails' be!" exclaimed Mr. Arlington,
                  "how full of the romance of life!"</p>
               <p>"Romance!" ejaculated Annie.</p>
               <p>"Yes, romance; for under this system, the poor man, whose life seemed doomed to be
                  one unbroken struggle with fortune, for the necessities of existence, finds
                  himself, by some unexpected casualty, the possessor of rank, and of what seems to
                  him boundless wealth."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes!" said I, "but you have given us only the bright side of the picture. To
                  make room for this stranger, whose only connection with the house of which he has
                  so unexpectedly become the head is probably that preserved in genealogical tables,
                  the daughters of the house, or their children it may be, reared in<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC7156-00000058"/> luxury, must go forth to a life of comparative
                  privation. I met, some years ago, in one of my visits to the Far West, a young
                  Englishman, who—but I will read you the story of his life, as I wrote it out soon
                  after parting with him."</p>
               <p>"Have you a picture of him, Aunt Nancy?" asked Robert Dudley.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Robert," I replied with a smile, "but you must have patience, for I shall
                  neither show the picture nor tell the story till evening."</p>
               <p>When we were assembled in the evening, Annie, with much ceremony, led me to the
                  high-backed arm-chair, which she called the Speaker's Chair, and placed before me
                  the small travelling-desk, in which she knew my manuscripts were kept. I unlocked
                  it, and soon found the scroll of which I was in search.</p>
               <p>"But the picture, Aunt Nancy—where is the picture?" cried the eager Robert.</p>
               <p>"Here it is," I cried, as I loosed the ribbon with which the manuscript was bound
                  together, and produced a small engraving, of which the reader has a copy on the
                  opposite page. It was eagerly caught by Robert, and handed around the circle, with
                  exclamations of "How handsome!" "What an exquisite picture!" "What a fine
                  engraving!" Mr. Arlington looked at it a moment, then, with a smiling glance at
                  me, handed it, without a word of comment, to Col. Donaldson.</p>
               <p>"The impertinent puppy!" ejaculated the Colonel, "engrossed with his hawk and his
                  hound, and wearing such an insolent air of self-absorption in the presence of a
                  lady—poor girl! if she was in any way connected with him, I am not surprised that
                  she should look so sad and reproachful."</p>
               <p>Mr. Arlington's smiling glance was again turned on me, and I met it with a hearty
                  laugh.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Aunt Nancy," said the Colonel, who seemed strangely annoyed by my
                  laughter, "I think your friend does you little credit, and I can only hope that he
                  had some of these lordly airs drubbed out of him at the West."</p>
               <p>As Col. Donaldson spoke he threw down the engraving which he had held, and pushed
                  his chair from the table.</p>
               <p>"I assure you, sir," I replied, "my friend has as few lordly airs as it is
                  possible to conceive in one born to such lordly circumstances, nor did I intend to
                  impose on you that excellent engraving of one of Landseer's finest designs as an
                  actual likeness of him—though had you ever seen him I might easily have done so,
                  for Landseer's hero really resembles mine very much in his personal traits. This
                  would have made the picture valuable to me, but I preserved it rather because it
                  seemed to me an admirable illustration of the tendencies of that idle, luxurious
                  life to which, before my acquaintance with him, he had been subjected."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am glad he did not sit for this picture," said Col. Donaldson; "now I can
                  listen to your story with some pleasure."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; you must first take some reflections suggested to me by the incidents
                  I have here narrated. Of the character of these reflections you will form some
                  conception from the title I have given to the tale into which I have interwoven
                  them. I have called it</p>

                  <head>Life in America.</head>
                  <p>"MEN and Manners in America" was the comprehensive title of a book issued some
                     fifteen or twenty years ago, by a gentleman from Scotland, to whom, we fear,
                     Americans have never tendered the grateful acknowledgments he deserved for his
                        disinterested<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7156-00000059"/> efforts to teach them
                     to eat eggs properly, and to give due time to the mastication of their food.
                     This benevolently instructive work was the precursor of a host of others on the
                     same or kindred topics. America has been the standard subject for the trial
                     essays of European tyros in philosophy, political economy, and book-making in
                     general. Society in America has been presented, it would seem, in all its
                     aspects—religious, educational, industrial, political, commercial, and
                     fashionable. Our schools and our prisons, our churches and our theatres, have
                     been in turn the subject of investigation, of unqualified censure, and scarce
                     less unqualified laudation.</p>
                  <p>The subject thus dissected, put together, and dissected again, has not been
                     able to forbear some wincing and an occasional outcry, when the scalpel has
                     been held by a more than usually unskilful hand—demonstrations of sensibility
                     which have occasioned apparently as much disapprobation as surprise in the
                     anatomists. We flatter ourselves that there is peculiar fitness in the metaphor
                     just used, for the outer form only of American life has been touched by these
                     various writers. Its spirit, that which gives to it its peculiar organization,
                     has evaded them as completely as the soul of man evades the keenest
                     investigations of the dissecting-room. Even of the seat of the spirit—of the
                     point whence it sends forth its subtle influences, giving activity and
                     direction to every member—of the HOMES of America, they have little real
                     knowledge. The anatomist—the reader will pardon the continuation of a figure so
                     illustrative of our meaning—the anatomist knows that not only can he never hope
                     to lay his finger upon the principle of life, but that ere he can pry into
                     those cells in which its mysterious processes are evolved, they must have been
                     dismantled of all that could have guided him to any certain deductions
                     respecting its nature and mode of action. And seldom is the eye of the
                     stranger, never that of the professed book-maker, suffered to rest upon our
                     homes till they have undergone changes that will as completely baffle his
                     penetration. Nor is this always designedly. It is from a delicate instinct
                     which shrinks from subjecting its most sacred and touching emotions to the rude
                     gaze and ruder comment of the world.</p>
                  <p>We have been led to these observations by certain events of which we have
                     lately become informed, and which we would here record, as illustrative of some
                     peculiarities of social life in America, and especially of the new development
                     of character manifested by woman under the influence of these
                     peculiarities.</p>
                  <p>The ringing of bells, the firing of cannon, the huzzaing of the assembling
                     multitude on the announcement in London of the victory of Waterloo, must have
                     seemed a bitter mockery to many a heart mad with the first sharp agony of
                     bereavement. "The few must suffer that the many may rejoice," say the statesman
                     and the warrior while they plan new conquests. It may be so, but we have at
                     present to do with the sufferings of the few.</p>
                  <p>On the list of the killed in that battle appeared the name of Horace Danforth,
                     Captain in the 41st Regiment of Infantry. It was a name of little note, but
                     there was one to whom it was the synonyme of all that gave beauty or gladness
                     to life; and ere the bells had ceased to sound, or the eager crowd to huzza,
                     her heart was still. With her last quivering sigh had mingled the wail of a
                     new-born infant.</p>
                  <p>Thus was Horace Maitland Danforth ushered into life. He had been born at the
                     house of his maternal uncle Sir Thomas Maitland, and as his mother had been
                     wholly dependent on<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7156-00000060"/> this gentleman,
                     and his father had been a soldier of fortune, leaving to his son no heritage
                     but his name, he continued there, as carefully reared and tenderly regarded as
                     though he had been the heir to Maitland Park and to all its dependencies.
                     Though Sir Thomas had, for many years after the birth of his nephew, intended
                     to marry, it was an intention never executed, and when Horace attained his
                     twenty-first birthday, his majority was celebrated as that of his uncle's heir,
                     and as such he was presented by Sir Thomas Maitland to his assembled tenantry.
                     Soon after this event, the Baronet obtained for his nephew a right to the name
                     and arms of Maitland—a measure to which, knowing little of his father's family,
                     Horace readily consented. Sir Thomas Maitland died suddenly while yet in the
                     prime of life, and was succeeded by Sir Horace, then twenty-four years of age.
                     In the enjoyments of society, of travel, and of those thousand luxuries, mental
                     and physical, which fortune secures, three years passed rapidly away with the
                     young, handsome, and accomplished Baronet.</p>
                  <p>One of the earliest convictions of Horace Maitland's life had been, that the
                     refining presence of woman was necessary to the perfection of Maitland Park,
                     and when Sir Thomas said to him, "Marry, Horace—do not be an old bachelor like
                     your uncle"—though he answered nothing, he vowed in the inmost recesses of his
                     heart that it should not be his fault if he did not obey the injunction. Yet to
                     the world it seemed wholly his own fault that at twenty-seven he had not given
                     to Maitland Park a mistress, and even he himself could not attribute his
                     continued celibacy to the coldness or cruelty of woman; for, in truth, though
                     he had "knelt at many a shrine," he had "laid his heart on none." If hardly
                     pressed for his reason, he might have said with Ferdinand,<q>

                  </p>
                  <p>He who after the death of his uncle continued to urge Sir Horace most on the
                     subject of matrimony, was the one of all the world who might have been supposed
                     least desirous to see him enter into its bonds. This was Edward Maitland, a
                     distant cousin, somewhat younger than himself, to whom he had been attached
                     from his boyhood, and who had been saved by his generosity from many of those
                     painful experiences to which a very narrow income would otherwise have
                     subjected him. It had more than once been suggested to Edward Maitland, that
                     should his cousin die unmarried, he might not unreasonably hope to become his
                     heir, as he was supposed to be uncontrolled by any entail in the disposal of
                     his property, and had few nearer relations than himself, and none with whom he
                     maintained such intimate and affectionate intercourse. Nor could Edward
                     Maitland fail to perceive that his own value in society was in inverse ratio to
                     the chances of the Baronet's marrying, as a report of an actual proposal on the
                     part of the latter had more than once occasioned a visible declension in the
                     number and warmth of his invitations. These considerations appeared, however,
                     only to stimulate the young man's activity in the search of a wife for his
                     cousin. Had he been employed by a marriage broker with a prospect of a liberal
                     commission, he could scarcely have been more indefatigable.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Horace," exclaimed the younger Maitland, as the two sat loitering over a
                     late London breakfast one morning, "how did you like the lady to whom I
                     introduced you last evening?"</p>
                  <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7156-00000061"/>
                  <p>A smile lighted the eyes of Sir Horace as he replied, "Very much, Nedmdash;she
                     is certainly intelligent, and has read and thought more than most ladies of her
                     age."</p>
                  <p>"She will make a very useful woman, I am sure."</p>
                  <p>"And an agreeable companion," added Sir Horace.</p>
                  <p>"And a good wife—do you not think so, Horace?"</p>
                  <p>"She doubtless would be to one who could fancy her, Ned; for me her style is a
                     little too <foreign xml:lang="FRA">prononcé</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>"Well, really, Horace, I cannot imagine what you will have. One woman is too
                     frivolous—another wants refinement—one is too indolent and exacting—and when
                     you can make no other objection, why, her style is a little too <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">prononcé</foreign>"—the last words were given with ludicrous
                     imitation of his cousin's tone. "If an angel were to descend from heaven for
                     you, I doubt if you would be suited."</p>
                  <p>"So do I," replied Horace, with a gay laugh at his cousin's evident
                     vexation.</p>
                  <p>And thus did he meet all Edward's well-intended efforts. The power of choice
                     had made him fastidious, and his life of luxury and freedom had brought him no
                     experiences of the need of another and gentler self as a consoler. But that
                     lesson was approaching.</p>
                  <p>A call from his lawyer for some papers necessary to complete an arrangement in
                     which he was much interested, had sent Sir Horace to Maitland Park, in the
                     midst of the London season, to explore the yet unfathomed recesses of an old
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">escritoire</foreign> of Sir Thomas. He had been gone
                     but two days when Edward received the following note from him, written, as it
                     seemed, both in haste and agitation:—</p>

                              <p>"Come to me immediately on the receipt of this, dear Edward. I have
                                 found here a paper of the utmost importance to you as well as to
                                 me. Come quickly—take the chariot and travel post.</p>
                              <closer>
                                 <salute>"Yours,</salute>
                                 <signed>H. D. MAITLAND."</signed>

                  </q>
                  <p>In less than an hour after the reception of this note Edward Maitland was on
                     the road, and travelling with the utmost expedition, he arrived at Maitland
                     Park just as the day was fading into dusky eve.</p>
                  <p>"How is Sir Horace?" he asked of the man who admitted him.</p>
                  <p>"I do not think he seems very well, sir. You will find him in the library, Mr.
                     Edward—shall I announce you, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"No," and with hurried steps and anxious heart Edward Maitland trod the
                     well-known passages leading to the library.</p>
                  <p>When he entered that room, Sir Horace was standing at one of its windows gazing
                     upon the landscape without, and so absorbed was he that he did not move at the
                     opening of the door. Edward spoke, and, starting, he turned towards him a face
                     haggard with some yet untold suffering. He advanced to meet his cousin, and
                     with an almost convulsive grasp of the hand, said, "l am glad you have come,
                     Edward,"—then, without heeding the anxious inquiries addressed to him by
                     Edward, he rang the bell, and ordered lights in a tone which caused them to be
                     brought without a moment's delay. As soon as the servant who brought them had
                     left the room, Horace resumed: "Now, Edward, here is the paper of which I wrote
                     to you; read it at once."</p>
                  <p>"Agitated by his cousin's manner, Edward took the old stained paper from him
                     without a word, and seating himself near the lights, began to read, while Sir
                     Horace stood just opposite him, eyeing him intently. In a very few minutes
                     Edward looked up with a puzzled air and said, "I do not understand one word of
                     it. "What does it all mean, Horace?"</p>
                  <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7156-00000062"/>
                  <p>"It means that you are Sir Edward Maitland—that you are master here—and that I
                     am a beggar."</p>
                  <p>"Horace, you are mad!" exclaimed the young man, starting from his chair, with
                     quivering limbs and a face from which every trace of color had departed.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto the tone in which Sir Horace had spoken, the alternate flush and
                     pallor on his face, and the shiver that occasionally passed over his frame, had
                     shown him to be fearfully excited; but as Edward became agitated, all these
                     signs of emotion passed away, and with wonderful calmness, taking the paper in
                     his hand, he commenced reading that part of it which explained its purpose.
                     This was to secure the descent of the baronetcy of Maitland and the property
                     attached to it in the male line. Having made Edward Maitland comprehend this
                     purpose, Sir Horace drew towards him a genealogical table of their family, and
                     showed him that he was himself the only living descendant in a direct line
                     through an unbroken succession of males from the period at which this entail
                     was made.</p>
                  <p>"And now, Edward," he said in conclusion, "I am prepared to give up every thing
                     to you. That you have so long been defrauded of your rights has been through
                     ignorance on my part, and equal ignorance, I am convinced, on the part of my
                     uncle. You know he paid little attention to business, leaving it wholly to his
                     agents. I have often heard him express a wish to examine the papers in the old
                     secretary in which I found this deed, saying that they had been sent home by
                     old Harris when he gave up his business to his nephew—the old man writing to my
                     uncle, that as they consisted of leases that had fallen in, or of antiquated
                     deeds, they were no longer of any value except as family records. It was a just
                     Providence that led me to that secretary to search for the missing title deeds
                     of the farm I was about to sell."</p>
                  <p>Edward Maitland had sunk into his chair from sheer inability to stand, and for
                     several minutes after his cousin had ceased speaking, he still sat, with his
                     elbows resting on the table before him, and his face buried in his clasped
                     hands. At length looking up, he said, "Horace, let us burn this paper and
                     forget it."</p>
                  <p>"Forget! that is impossible, Edward."</p>
                  <p>"Why?—why not live as we have done? You speak of defrauding me, but what have I
                     wanted that you had? Has not your purse been as my own? Your home—has it not
                     been mine? It shall be so still. We will share the fortune, and as to the
                     title, you will wear it more gracefully than I."</p>
                  <p>"Dear Edward! Such proof of your generous affection ought to console me for all
                     changes, and it shall. I will confess to you that I have suffered, but it is
                     past. My people——" his voice faltered, his chest heaved, and turning away he
                     walked more than once across the room before he resumed—"they are mine no
                     longer—but you will be kind to them, Edward, I know."</p>
                  <p>"Horace, you will drive me mad!" cried Edward Maitland. "Promise, I conjure
                     you, promise me to say nothing more of this."</p>
                  <p>He threw himself as he spoke into his cousin's arms with an agitation which
                     Horace vainly sought to soothe, until he promised "to <emph>speak</emph>" no
                     further on this subject at present to any one. Satisfied with this promise, and
                     exhausted by the emotions of the last hour, Edward soon retired to his own
                     room. It was long before he slept, and had he not been in a distant part of the
                     house, he would have heard the hurried steps with which, for many an hour after
                     he was left alone, Sir Horace Maitland continued to pace the floor of the dimly
                     lighted library. The clock was on the stroke of three when he seated himself
                     and began the following letter:</p>

                                 can I live as a dependent within these walls—no, not for an hour.
                                 Do not attempt to follow me, for I will not see you. I will write
                                 you as soon as I arrive at my point of destination—I know not yet
                                 where that will be. Feel no anxiety about me. I shall take with me

                                 favors upon me, Edward—I cannot bear them now. Such attempts would
                                 only compel me to cut myself loose from you and your affection—the
                                 one blessing that earth still holds for me.</p>
                              <p>My trunks have been packed for two days, for my first resolve was
                                 to go from this place and from England. I shall take the chariot in
                                 which you came down and fresh horses, but I will send them back to
                                 you from London.</p>
                              <p>God bless you, Edward. I dare not speak of my feelings to you now,
                                 lest I should lose the strength and self-command I need so much.
                                 God bless you.</p>

                  <p>Stealthily did Sir Horace move through the wide halls and ascend the lofty
                     stairs of this home of his life, feeling at every step the rushing tide of
                     memory conflicting with the sad thought that he was treading them for the last
                     time. Having reached his sleeping apartment, he rang a bell which he knew would
                     summon his own man. Rapidly as the man moved, the time seemed long to him ere
                     the summons was obeyed, and he had given the necessary orders to have the
                     carriage prepared and the trunks brought down as soon as possible, "and as
                     quietly," he added, "as he did not wish to disturb Mr. Edward, who had retired
                     to bed late."</p>
                  <p>"Will you not take breakfast, sir, before you set out?" asked the man.</p>
                  <p>"No, John. Let the carriage follow me; I shall walk on. Be quick, and make no
                     noise."</p>
                  <p>A faint streak of light was just beginning to appear in the east, when the
                     heretofore master of that lordly mansion went out into a world which held for
                     him no other home. ACCIDENT, as short-sighted mortals name events controlled by
                     no human will, decided whither he should direct his course from London. He had
                     called at his lawyer'smdash;the already mentioned "nephew of old
                     Harris"—determined to communicate his discovery to him, perhaps with some faint
                     hope of learning that the entail had been in some way set aside, before Sir
                     Thomas had ventured to make his sister's son his heir. Mr. Decker was not in
                     his rooms, and sitting down to wait for him, he took up mechanically the
                     morning paper that lay on his table. The first thing on which his eyes rested
                     was the advertisement of a steam packet about to sail from Liverpool for
                     America.</p>
                  <p>"America!—the very place for me. I shall meet no acquaintance there," was the
                     thought which flashed through his mind. Another glance at the paper for the day
                     and hour of the packet's sailing, an examination of his watch, an impatient
                     look from the window up and down the street, and again he mused, "I have not a
                     moment to spare, and if I wait for Decker I may be kept for hours, and so lose
                     the packet; and why should I wait. Have I not seen the deed? This indecision is
                     folly."</p>
                  <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7156-00000064"/>
                  <p>The result of these reflections was a note rapidly written to Mr. Decker,
                     stating his discovery of the deed of entail, his consequent surrender of all
                     claim to the property to Edward Maitland, and his determination to quit England
                     immediately. All arrangements respecting the settlement of his claims on the
                     estate, and the claims of the present proprietor upon him, he left to Sir
                     Edward and Mr. Decker, empowering the latter to receive and retain for his use
                     and subject to his order, whatever, on such a settlement, should appertain to
                     him.</p>
                  <p>This note was left on Mr. Decker's table, and in one hour after leaving his
                     office Horace Maitland was advancing to Liverpool with the rapidity of steam.
                     The packet waited but the arrival of the train in which he was a passenger, to
                     leave the shores of England. With what bitterness he watched those receding
                     shores, while memory wrote upon his bare and bleeding heart the record of joys
                     identified with them, and fading like them for ever from his life, let each
                     imagine for himself, for to such emotions no language can do justice.</p>

                              <p>DEAR EDWARD—Here I am among the republicans, with whom I may
                                 flatter myself I have lost nothing by sinking Sir Horace Maitland
                                 into plain Mr. Danforth. Such is now my address, assumed not from
                                 fear that in this distant quarter of the world I shall meet any to
                                 whom the name of Maitland is familiar, but because much of which I
                                 do not desire to be reminded is associated with that name. I said
                                 to you when leaving my home, dear Edward, "Do not fear for me." I
                                 can now repeat this with better reason. The first stunning shock of
                                 the change to which I was so suddenly subjected has been borne. My
                                 past life already seems to me as a dream from which I have been
                                 rudely but effectually awakened. I am now first to begin life in
                                 reality.</p>
                              <p>The accident which determined me to seek these shores was a happy
                                 one. I cannot well dream here where all around me is active,
                                 vigorous life. We are accustomed in England to think of the
                                 American shores as the Ultima Thule in a western direction, but
                                 when we reach these shores we find that the movement is still west.
                                 The daily papers are filled with accounts of persons migrating
                                 west, and thither am I going. "The world is all before me where to
                                 choose" the theatre of my new life—my life of work—and I would have
                                 it far from the blue sea, out of hearing of the murmur of the waves
                                 that lave my island home. I will go where the wide prairies sweep
                                 away on every side to the horizon—where every link with other lands
                                 will be severed, and America below and Heaven above constitute my
                                 universe. "You will find no society at the West," has been said to
                                 me. This is another attraction to that region. I would work out my
                                 destiny in solitude. I desire to travel without company, and have
                                 made my arrangements accordingly. I have purchased three
                                 substantial horses for a little more than one hundred pounds, and
                                 have engaged a shrewd, active lad as groom, valet, and he seems to
                                 think, companion, at about two pounds per month. A very light
                                 carriage, sometimes driven by my servant and sometimes by myself,
                                 will transport the moderate wardrobe which I shall deem it
                                 necessary to take with me to the outermost verge of civilization
                                 and good roads, where leaving carriage and wardrobe, or at least
                                 all of the last which may not be borne by a led-horse, I shall
                                 penetrate still further into the old forests of this New World. I

                  <p>A new external life had indeed opened upon this child of luxury and
                     conventional refinement. He whose movements had been chronicled as matter of
                     interest to the public, for whose presence the "world" had postponed its fetes,
                     might now travel hundreds of miles without observation or inquiry. He upon
                     whose steps had waited a crowd of obsequious attendants, now found himself with
                     one follower, whose tone of independence scarce permitted him to call him
                     servant. In cities, where he would still have been surrounded by those
                     conventional distinctions of which he had himself been deprived, the sense of a
                     great loss would have been ever present with him, and the contrast with the
                     past would have made the fairest present to which he could now attain,
                     desolate. But there could be no comparison, and therefore no painful contrast,
                     between the wild life of the prairies and the ultra-civilization of English
                     aristocratic society. In the excitement and adventure of the one, he hoped to
                     forget the other. He sought to forget—not to be resigned, to acquiesce. His
                     inner life was unchanged. He had been a dreamer—a pleasure-seeker—and a dreamer
                     and pleasure-seeker he continued, though the dreams and the pleasures must be
                     wrought from new materials. To sketch the progress of such a character through
                     the shifting scenes of his new existence—to observe him in his association with
                     the strong, daring, acute, but uncultivated denizens of our frontier States—to
                     stand with sympathizing heart beside him as he first entered upon those
                     unpeopled solitudes in whose silence God speaks to the soul, is not permitted
                     us at present. This may be the work of another day; but now we must pass at
                     once with him from Boston to a scene within the confines of Iowa. His carriage
                     had been left behind, and for two days he had been riding over a rolling
                     country, whose grassy knolls, dotted here and there with clumps of trees,
                     brought occasionally to his mind the park scenery of his own land. Early in
                     this day he had passed a farm with a comfortable house and substantial
                     out-buildings, but no dwelling of man had since presented itself to him, though
                     the sun was now low in the western sky. Under ordinary circumstances this would
                     have been of little consequence, for he had already spent more than one night
                     in the open air without discomfort; but his attendant had heard a distant
                     muttering of thunder, and John Stacy was not the lad to encounter without
                     murmuring a night of storm unsheltered. John's anxiety made him keen-sighted,
                     and he was the first to perceive and announce the approach of a rider. We use
                     the neutral term <emph>rider</emph> not without consideration, for he was one
                     in whom a certain ease of manner, and even an air of command, contradicted the
                     testimony of habiliments made and worn after a fashion recognized nowhere as
                     characteristic of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">genus</foreign> gentleman. A
                     courteous inquiry from Horace Danforth respecting the nearest place at which a
                     night's shelter might be obtained, led to a cordial invitation to him to return
                     with him to his own house. It was an invitation not to be disregarded under
                     existing circumstances, and it was accepted with evident pleasure both by
                     master and man.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Grahame, for so the new-comer had announced himself, led the way back for a
                     short distance over the route just pursued<pb n="112-113"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000066"/> by our travellers, and then striking off to the
                     left, rode briskly forward for several miles. The light gray clouds which had
                     long been gathering in the western sky had deepened into blackness as they
                     proceeded, and flashes of lightning were darting across their path, and large
                     drops of rain were falling upon them when they neared a house constructed of
                     logs, yet bearing some evidence of taste in the grounds around it, as well as
                     in its position, which was on the side of a gently sloping hill, looking out
                     upon a landscape through which wound a clear and rapid, though narrow
                     stream.</p>
                  <p>"Like good cavaliers, we will see our horses housed first," said Mr. Grahame,
                     riding past the main building to one of the out-houses, built also of logs,
                     which served as a stable. Here Horace Danforth relinquished his tired steed to
                     the care of John Stacy, and Mr. Grahame having himself rubbed down his own
                     beautiful animal, and thrown a bundle of hay before him, with a slight apology
                     to his visitor for the detention, led the way into the house. As they entered
                     the vacant parlor a shade of something like dissatisfaction passed over the
                     master's countenance, and having seen his guest seated by a huge fire-place,
                     whose cheerful blaze of wood a chilly evening made by no means unwelcome, he
                     left him alone. He soon returned, however, with a brighter expression, which
                     was explained by his saying, "I feared, on finding this room empty, that my
                     daughter had been sent for to a sick woman with whom she has lately spent
                     several days and nights, and that I could offer you only the discomforts of a
                     bachelor's establishment; but I find she is at home, and will soon give us
                     supper."</p>
                  <p>During the absence of his host, our Englishman had looked around with
                     increasing surprise at the contents of the parlor. The furniture was of the
                     most simple description, yet marked by a certain neatness and gracefulness of
                     arrangement indicative, as he could not but think, of a cultivated taste. The
                     same mingling of even rude simplicity of material and tasteful arrangement
                     prevailed in the chamber to which his host now conducted him, and where the
                     luxury, for such he had learned to regard it, of abundance of clear water and
                     clean napkins awaited him. In a very few minutes after his return to the parlor
                     a door was opened, through which he obtained a view of an inner apartment, well
                     lighted, and containing a table so spread as to present no slight temptation to
                     a traveller who had not broken his fast since the morning meal. At the head of
                     this table stood a young woman of graceful form, whom his host introduced to
                     him as his daughter, Miss Grahame.</p>
                  <p>Mary Grahame's clear complexion glowing with the hue of health, her large and
                     soft and dark gray eyes, her abundant glossy black hair, might have won from
                     the most fastidious some of that admiration given to personal beauty; but in
                     truth Horace Danforth had grown indifferent as well as fastidious, and it was
                     not till in after days he had seen the complexion glow and the dark eyes kindle
                     with feeling, that he said to himself, "She is beautiful." To the fascination
                     of a peculiarly graceful, gentle, yet earnest manner he was, however, more
                     quickly susceptible. During this first evening, the chief emotion excited in
                     his mind was surprise at the style of conversation and manner, the acquaintance
                     with books and with <foreign xml:lang="FRA">les bienséances</foreign> which
                     marked these inhabitants of a log cabin in the western wilds—these denizens of
                     a half-savage life.</p>
                  <p>A day of hard riding had induced such fatigue, that even the rare and
                     unexpected pleasure of communication with refined and<pb n="114-115"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000067"/> cultivated minds could not keep Horace Danforth
                     long from his pillow. As he expected to set out in the morning very early, he
                     would have made his adieus in parting for the night, mingling with them
                     courteous expressions of the enjoyment which such society had afforded him
                     after his long abstinence from all intellectual converse.</p>
                  <p>"Believe me," said Mr. Grahame, and the sentiment was corroborated by his
                     daughter's eyes, "the pleasure has been mutual. Society is the great want of
                     our western life. I have been wishing to ask whether your business was too
                     urgent to permit you to afford us more of this coveted good?"</p>
                  <p>"I am ashamed to confess," said Horace Danforth, with some embarrassment, "that
                     I have no business at present—that I am an idler—I verily believe the only one
                     in your country."</p>
                  <p>"Then will you not give us the pleasure of your company for a longer time? A
                     little rest will be no disadvantage either to your horses or yourself, and on
                     us you will be conferring a favor which you cannot appreciate till you have
                     lived five hundred miles away from civilization."</p>
                  <p>The invitation was accepted as cordially as it was given, to the great
                     satisfaction of John Stacy, who had been much pleased with the appearance of
                     land in this neighborhood, and wanted time to look about him preparatory to
                     purchasing.</p>
                  <p>Horace Danforth awoke early the next morning, and throwing open the shutters of
                     the only window in his room, found that a stormy night had been succeeded by an
                     unusually brilliant morning. "To brush the dews from off the upland lawn," had
                     not been a habit of his past life; but the cool fresh air, the spicy perfumes
                     which it wafted to him, and the brightness and verdure of the whole landscape,
                     proved now more inviting than his pillow, and dressing himself hastily, he
                     descended the clean but rude and uncarpeted stairs as gently as possible, lest
                     he should rouse Miss Grahame from her slumbers. He found the front door open,
                     showing that he was not the first of the household who had gone abroad that
                     day. As he stepped out upon the lawn, he discovered that the parlor windows
                     were likewise open, and a familiar air, hummed in low, suppressed tones, caused
                     him to look through them as he passed. Could he believe his eyes? Was that
                     neatest and prettiest of all housemaids, who, moving with light and even
                     graceful steps, was yet busied in the very homely task of dusting and arranging
                     the furniture in the parlor—was she indeed the same Miss Grahame who had last
                     evening charmed him by her lady-like deportment and intelligent conversation?
                     Yes, the very same; for though the glossy black braids were covered by a gay
                     colored handkerchief wound around her head <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à la
                        Turque,</foreign> there was the same wide forehead and well-defined brows;
                     the same soft, dark gray eyes; the same slightly aquiline nose and; smiling
                     mouth. Nor was the conversation of last evening more opposed, in his
                     imagination, to her present employment, than the evident taste and feeling with
                     which she was now singing that most beautiful hymn of the Irish poet:— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"O God! Thou art the life and light</l>
                           <l>Of all this wondrous world I see."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> Listening and gazing, wondering and comparing, he had well nigh forgotten
                     himself when, turning suddenly to the window and raising her head, their eyes
                     met. The color which rushed quickly to her very temples, recalled him to
                     himself, and bowing, with certainly not less embarrassment than she evinced, he
                     walked rapidly on. He had not proceeded far, however, when he saw<pb
                        n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7156-00000068"/> his host approaching from an
                     opposite direction. As Mr. Grahame had already spent more than an hour in his
                     fields, sharing as well as directing the labors of his men, he expressed no
                     surprise at meeting his guest abroad. After a cordial greeting, and a few
                     general observations on the weather and scenery had been exchanged, Mr.
                     Grahame, glancing up at the sun, which had now risen considerably above a
                     distant wood, said, "I am sorry to interrupt your walk, but my morning's work
                     has made me by no means indifferent to my breakfast, and I think that Mary's
                     coffee and biscuits are about this time done to a turn."</p>
                  <p>A few minutes brought them back to the house, and into the parlor from which
                     Mary Grahame had disappeared, leaving behind her, in its neat and tasteful
                     arrangement, and in the fresh flowers that adorned the table and mantelpiece,
                     evidence of her presence. The gentlemen were soon summoned to breakfast.</p>
                  <p>It may have been that his early rising had given to Horace Danforth an unusual
                     appetite; but certain it is that no breakfast of which he had ever partaken
                     seemed to him half so inviting as this. And yet, in truth, it was simple
                     enough: toast, crisp and brown, warm, light biscuits, fresh eggs, good butter,
                     excellent coffee, and rich cream, were all it offered. Mary Grahame presided,
                     and, speaking little herself, listened to her father and Horace, while they
                     discussed the different characteristics of English or European and American
                     society, with a pleased and intelligent countenance. Some observation from him
                     drew from Mr. Grahame the following reply—</p>
                  <p>"There is one feature of American society upon which I think no foreigner has
                     remarked, or if he has, it has been so cursorily as plainly to show that he was
                     far from appreciating its importance; I mean the fact that here the thinker is
                     likewise the worker. In England and the European States, the working class is
                     distinct from the consumers, and there must be almost as great a contrast in
                     the intellectual as in the physical condition of the two. All the refinement,
                     the cultivation, must remain with those who have leisure and fortune—as a
                     class, I mean, for individuals will of course be found, who, in spite of all
                     disadvantages, will rise to the highest position. But here, in America, there
                     are no idlers. Here, with few if any exceptions, all must be, in some way,
                     workers, and all may be thinkers. We attain thus to a republic of mind."</p>
                  <p>"Do you not fear that the result of this will be to check the development of
                     individual greatness; that as you have no king in the State, so you will have
                     no king in literature?"</p>
                  <p>"Even were this so, it would remain a question, whether the great increase of
                     general intelligence would not more than compensate the evil."</p>
                  <p>"Can many Polloks repay us for one Milton—many Drydens for one Shakspeare?"</p>
                  <p>"You take extreme cases; besides, I only admitted your supposition to show that
                     I could produce a set-off to the disadvantage. I do not believe that the
                     necessity for labor of some sort will prevent a truly great mind from achieving
                     for itself the highest distinction. I think the history of such minds proves
                     that it will rather serve as a stimulus to their powers."</p>
                  <p>Horace Danforth was silent, and after a moment's pause, Mr. Grahame
                     resumed.</p>
                  <p>"In this union of the working and the thinking classes the refinements of life,
                     those things which adorn and beautify it, take their true place as consolers
                     and soothers of the care-worn and toil-wearied mind. No Italian opera can give
                     such delight<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7156-00000069"/> to the sated man of
                     pleasure as the tired laborer feels in listening to the evening song with which
                     some loved one, in his home, sings him to repose."</p>
                  <p>"You speak <foreign xml:lang="ITA">con amore,</foreign>" said Horace Danforth,
                     smiling at his host's fervor.</p>
                  <p>"I do. Had I been excluded from the refinements of social life, I should long
                     since have fainted and grown weary of my toil here. I felt this when compelled
                     to relinquish my daughter's society for two years, that she might have the
                     advantage of instruction in those branches of a womanly education in which I
                     could give her no aid."</p>
                  <p>"And having spent two years in the more cultivated East, did Miss Grahame
                     return willingly to her home in the wilderness?"</p>
                  <p>This question was addressed to Mary Grahame herself, and she answered simply,
                     "My father was here."</p>
                  <p>"You acknowledge, then, that could your father have been with you, you would
                     have preferred remaining at the East?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no! I was fifteen when my father sent me from home, and those who have
                     enjoyed the free life of the prairies so long, seldom love cities."</p>
                  <p>"But the ease, the freedom from labor which is enjoyed in a more advanced stage
                     of society, the power to devote yourself to pursuits agreeable to your
                     taste—did you not regret these?"</p>
                  <p>"Permit me to put your question into plainer language," interposed Mr. Grahame.
                     "Mr. Danforth would ask, Mary, whether you would not prefer to live where you
                     would not be compelled to degrade your mind——"</p>
                  <p>No, no, I protest against the degradation," exclaimed Mr. Danforth.</p>
                  <p>"To degrade your mind," pursued Mr. Grahame, answering the interruption only by
                     a smile, "by exercising it on such homely things as brewing coffee and baking
                     cakes, or to soil your fair hands with brooms and dusters."</p>
                  <p>"For the soil of the hands we have sparkling rills, and for the degradation of
                     the mind, I, like Mr. Danforth, protest against it."</p>
                  <p>"But how can you make your protest good?"</p>
                  <p>"You have taught me that there is no degradation in labor, pursued for fair and
                     right ends, and that where the end is noble, the labor becomes ennobling."</p>
                  <p>"But what noble ends can be alleged for the drudgery of domestic life? I am
                     translating your looks into language," said Mr. Grahame, turning playfully to
                     his guest; "correct me if I do not read them rightly."</p>
                  <p>"If I say you do, I fear Miss Grahame will think them very impertinent
                     looks."</p>
                  <p>"I shall not complain of them while I can reply to them so easily," said Mary
                     gayly. "He who knows how much a well-ordered household contributes to the
                     cultivation of domestic virtues and family affections, will not think a woman
                     degraded who sacrifices somewhat of her tastes and pleasures to the deeper
                     happiness of procuring such advantages for those she loves."</p>
                  <p>"But is not that state of society preferable in which, without her personal
                     interference, by the employment of those who have no higher tastes, she may
                     accomplish the same object?"</p>
                  <p>"That question proves that you do not, like my father, desire to see the
                     working and the thinking classes united. You seen to propose that the first
                     shall ever remain our hewers of wood and drawers of water."</p>
                  <p>"Is it not a fact that there have been, are, and always will be those in the
                     world who are fitted for no other position?"</p>
                  <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7156-00000070"/>
                  <p>"That there are and always have been such persons, I acknowledge; but when
                     labor ceases to be degrading, because it is partaken by all, may we not hope
                     that new aspirations will be awakened in the laborer—that he will elevate
                     himself in the scale of being when he feels elevation possible?"</p>
                  <p>Mary Grahame spoke with generous enthusiasm, yet with a modest gentleness which
                     made Horace Danforth desire to continue the argument.</p>
                  <p>"Admitting all this," he said, "it does not answer my question, which was,
                     whether you did not prefer that state of society in which you were able to
                     avail yourself of the services of such a class."</p>
                  <p>"There are moments, doubtless, when indolence would plead for such
                     self-indulgence; but I should be mortified indeed, were this the prevailing
                     temper of my mind."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me if I say that I do not see how it can be otherwise—how a lady of
                     Miss Grahame's refinement and taste can be pleased with the employments, for
                     instance, to which Mr. Grahame just now referred."</p>
                  <p>"Not pleased with them in themselves, but she may accept them, may she not, as
                     a necessary part of a great object to whish she has devoted herself?"</p>
                  <p>"And this object?—but, forgive me. The interest you have awakened in the
                     subject, and your kindness in answering my questions, make me an encroacher, I
                     fear," he added, as he marked the heightened color with which Mary glanced at
                     her father as he paused for her answer.</p>
                  <p>"Not at all; but I speak in presence of my master, and will refer you to him,"
                     she replied, with another smiling glance at her father.</p>
                  <p>"You see," said Mr. Grahame, "that even in these wilds, 'the world's dread
                     laugh' retains its power. Mary, I see, is afraid of being called a female
                     Quixote, and even I find myself disposed to win you to some interest in my
                     object, before I avow it. This I think I can best do by a sketch of the of the
                     circumstances led to its adoption. I will give you such a sketch, therefore, if
                     you will promise to acquit me of egotism in doing so."</p>
                  <p>"That I will readily do. I shall be delighted to hear it."</p>
                  <p>"You shall have it, but not now; for I see, by certain cabalistic signs, known
                     only to the initialed, that Mary is about to leave us for some of those same
                     degrading employments, and if you will take a ride with me, I will relieve you
                     form all danger of contact with them, and will, at the same time, show you
                     something of our neighborhood."</p>
                  <p>The proposal was of course accepted. The ride embraced a circuit of ten miles,
                     in which they passed only two houses. The first of these was built with and
                     apparent regard to convenience and comfort, and even some effort at adornment,
                     as manifested in the climbling plants with which the windows were draperied,
                     and the flowers which adorned the little court in front. Mr. Grahame stopped
                     before the gateway of this court, and a woman of coarse, rough exterior, though
                     scrupulously clean, came out to speak to him, and to urge his alighting and
                     entering the house with his friend. This Mr. Grahame declined; he had only
                     stopped to inquire after a sick child, and to express a hope that her husband's
                     hay had turned out well.</p>
                  <p>"Dreadful fine," was her reply to the last. "I'm sure we much obleeged to you
                     for the seed, and for tellin' Jim how to plant it. He never had sich hay
                     before."</p>
                  <p>"I'm glad to hear it. Where is Lucy?"</p>

                  <p>"Oh, she's off to school. Tell Miss Mary she's gittin' to be 'most as grand a
                     reader as she be. And yet the child's willin' enough to work, for all."</p>
                  <p>As the gentlemen rode on, after this interview, Mr. Grahame said, "That last
                     speech expressed one of the greatest difficulties against which we had to
                     contend in our efforts to induce our neighbors to give to their children some
                     of the advantages of education. They were afraid 'larnin' would make them
                     lazy.' They were of your opinion, that the thinker and the worker must remain
                     of different classes."</p>
                  <p>"I was surprised to hear that woman speak of a school. I should not think the
                     teacher could find his situation very profitable."</p>
                  <p>"He is one who has regard to a higher reward than any earthly one. He is a
                     self-denying Christian missionary, whom I induced to settle in our
                     neighborhood. He preaches on the Sabbath, in a little church about two miles
                     from my house, to a congregation of about twenty adults, and twice that number
                     of children; and during the week, he keeps a school which is well attended in
                     the summer. Some of his earlier pupils are already showing, by their more
                     useful and happier lives, the importance of the schoolmaster's work in the
                     elevation of a people."</p>
                  <p>The next dwelling they approached was very small and mean-looking. It seemed to
                     Horace Danforth to contain but one apartment, warmed by an ill-constructed clay
                     chimney, and lighted by one small, square window. That window, however, was not
                     only sashed and glazed, but covered with a plain muslin curtain.</p>
                  <p>"Here," said Mr. Grahame, "lives one of those pupils of whom I spoke just now.
                     He has commenced life with nothing but the plot of ground you see, and having a
                     wife to support, he must labor hard, yet already he is aiming at something more
                     than the supply of merely physical wants; and I doubt not he will, if he lives
                     long enough, become the intelligent and wealthy father of a well-educated
                     family."</p>
                  <p>They were approaching the house as Mr. Grahame spoke. Near it was a small
                     field, in which a man was hoeing.</p>
                  <p>"How is your wife, Martin?" asked Mr. Grahame.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, thank you, sir, she is quite smart. She's been getting better ever since
                     the night Miss Mary sat up with her last. We say she always brings good
                     luck."</p>
                  <p>"And how are your potatoes?"</p>
                  <p>"How could they help but be good, sir, with such grand seed as you gave me?
                     Tell Miss Mary, if you please, sir, that the rose-tree is growing finely, and
                     that as soon as I can get time to put up the fence, Sally is to have the
                     flower-garden she talked about."</p>
                  <p>"I am glad to hear it, Martin; if you are brisk you may have some flowers yet
                     before frost. I will bring you some seeds when I come next."</p>
                  <p>"Do you procure your seeds from the East, or is it the result of your superior
                     cultivation, that you; are able thus to supply your neighbors?" asked Horace
                     Danforth of Mr. Grahame, as they rode on.</p>
                  <p>"The potatoes were from my own field, raised from the seed two years ago. The
                     grass and flower seeds were from my agent at the East. These little favors win
                     for my daughter and myself considerable influence over our neighbors, and thus
                     facilitate our attainment of the object for which we have pitched our tent in
                     the wilderness, and accepted those labors which you justly regard as
                     distasteful in themselves."</p>
                  <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7156-00000072"/>
                  <p>The return home of Mr. Grahame and his visitor, their dinner and afternoon
                     engagements, offer nothing worthy of our notice. It was not till the labors of
                     the day had been concluded, and the little party were gathered again before a
                     cheerful fire in the parlor, that the subject of the morning's conversation was
                     resumed. As Mary entered from the supper-room, bringing with her a little
                     basket of needle-work, Horace Danforth asked if he might not now hope to
                     receive the promised sketch.</p>
                  <p>"I will give it to you with pleasure when I have had my evening song from
                     Mary," said Mr. Grahame.</p>
                  <p>Opening the piano for his young hostess, Horace Danforth stood beside her as
                     she sang, but he forgot to turn the leaves of the music before her as he
                     listened once again to a rich and cultivated voice, accompanied by a fine
                     instrument, touched by a skilful hand. As the sweet and well-remembered strains
                     fell on his ear, he closed his eyes and gave the reins to fancy. The loved and
                     lost gathered around him, and it was with a strange, dream-like feeling that,
                     as the sweet sounds ceased, and Mary arose from the piano, he opened his eyes
                     and looked around upon the rough walls and simple furniture of his present
                     abode.</p>
                  <p>"It is now nearly nineteen years," began Mr. Grahame, when his daughter and
                     guest had resumed their seats near him, "since, crushed in spirit, I turned
                     from the grave in which I had laid my chief earthly blessing, to wander 'any
                     where, any where out of that world' which had a few weeks before been bright
                     and joyous to me, but which I was now ready to pronounce a desolate waste. The
                     desire to avoid society made me turn westward, and nearly one hundred miles
                     east of our present residence I found myself in the midst of a people without
                     churches, without schools, rude in appearance and in manners. Absorbed in the
                     destruction of my own selfish happiness, I might have passed from among them
                     without knowing that disease was adding its pangs to those inflicted by want,
                     ignorance, and superstition, had not a mother in the agony of parting from her
                     first-born, looking hither and thither for help, turned her eyes entreatingly
                     upon the stranger. I had once studied medicine, though regarding the
                     profession, as our young men too often do, merely as a means of personal
                     aggrandizement, and having received just at the completion of my studies an
                     accession of fortune, which removed all pecuniary necessity to exertion on my
                     own part, I had never practised it, nor indeed obtained the diploma necessary
                     to its practice. Now, however, I endeavored to make myself master of the
                     peculiar features of the epidemic under which the child was suffering, and with
                     the aid of a small store of medicines which my good sister had insisted on my
                     taking with me, and a rigid enforcement of some of the simplest rules of diet
                     and regimen, I had the happiness of seeing the child in a few days out of
                     danger, and of receiving the mother's rapturous thanks. That moment gave me the
                     first gleam of happiness I had known for months, and disposed me to listen to
                     the entreaties of the poor creatures who came from far and near to entreat the
                     aid of the Doctor, as they persisted in calling me, notwithstanding my repeated
                     assurances that I had no right to the title. I spent weeks in that
                     neighborhood, and there I was born to a new life. Till that time I had lived to
                     myself, and when that in which I had centered my earthly joy was snatched from
                     me by death, I had felt that life had nothing left for me; but now I saw that
                     while there were sentient beings in the universe to serve, and a glorious and
                     ever-blessed Father presiding over that universe and smiling on such service,
                     life could not be divested of joy. Under the influence of such views my plans
                        for<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7156-00000073"/> the future were formed, nor
                     have I ever seen reason to change or to regret them. Every where the Christian
                     religion teaches the same precepts, but not every where is it equally easy to
                     see the way in which those precepts may be obeyed; every where it is true, as a
                     distinguished writer of your own land has said, 'Blessed is the man who has
                     found his work—let him seek no other blessedness;' but not every where is it
                     equally easy to see where our work lies. Here, in America, the partition-walls
                     which stand elsewhere as a remnant of the old feudalism, have been broken down;
                     every man is irresistibly pressed into contact with his neighbors—he cannot
                     shut his eyes to their wants—he cannot stop his ears against their cries. In
                     America, too, every man, as I have already said, must be a worker—or, if he
                     live an idler, it must be on that which his father gained by the sweat of his
                     brow, and he leaves his children to enslaving toil, or more enslaving
                     dependence. Here the man of pleasure, the idler of either sex, is a foreign
                     exotic which finds no nourishment in our soil, no shelter from our
                     institutions—which is out of harmony with our social life, and must ever be
                     marked by the innate vulgarity of unsustained pretension. Therefore it is
                     comparatively easy for us to hold out the hand of love to our brethren, sinking
                     and suffering at our very side, and to teach them that there is no natural
                     inalienable connection between labor and coarseness, ignorance and servility;
                     that man, though compelled to win his bread by the sweat of his brow, may still
                     enjoy all those graceful amenities of which woman was the type in Paradise and
                     is the promoter here; that the light of knowledge and the divine light of faith
                     may still cheer him in his labors and guide him to his rest. It seems to me
                     that to bring out these principles fairly to the world's perception, is the
                     mission to which America has been especially appointed—is that for which
                     Americans should live; and to this I have accordingly devoted myself. For this
                     I purchased my present property—for this I determined, while allowing myself
                     and my daughter all the comforts of life, to dispense with many of those
                     luxuries to which my fortune might have seemed to entitle us, lest I should
                     separate myself too far from those I would aid. Here I have spent seventeen
                     years of life, happy in my work, and happier in the conviction that it has not
                     been in vain."</p>
                  <p>As Mr. Grahame paused, Horace Danforth turned to Mary Grahame. Her eyes were
                     fixed upon him. They seemed to challenge his admiration for her father, in
                     whose hand her own was clasped, as if she would thus intimate the perfect
                     accordance of her feelings with his.</p>
                  <p>"And this, then," he said to her, "is your object?"</p>
                  <p>"It is."</p>
                  <p>"An object to which you were devoted by your father in your infancy?"</p>
                  <p>"And which I have since adopted on my own intelligent conviction," said Mary
                     earnestly, losing all timidity in a glow of that generous enthusiasm which sits
                     so gracefully on a gentle woman.</p>
                  <p>There was silence in the little circle—silence with all: with one, thought was
                     rapidly passing down the long vista of the past, and pointing the awakened mind
                     to the fact that elsewhere than in America was there ignorance to be
                     enlightened and want to be relieved—that not here only did Christianity teach
                     that man should live not unto himself, and that he should love his neighbor as
                     himself.</p>
                  <p>The thoughts and feelings aroused on that evening colored the whole future
                     destiny of Horace Danforth. Ere another day<pb n="128-129"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000074"/> had passed, he had confided to his host so much
                     of his history as proved him to be an aimless and almost unconnected wanderer
                     on the earth, with a prospect of a fortune which, unequal to the demands of a
                     man of fashion in England, would give to a <emph>worker</emph> in America great
                     influence for good or for evil—as the personal property of Sir Thomas Maitland
                     could not, as Horace Danforth was well aware, be valued at less than $50,000.
                     With that rapid decision that had ever marked his movements, the young
                     Englishman determined to purchase land in the neighbor, hood of Mr. Grahame,
                     there to rear his future home, and to devote his life to the like noble
                     purposes. The land was purchased, the site for the house was selected and
                     marked out—but the house was never built—for ere that had been accomplished
                     Horace Danforth discovered that the companionship of a cultivated woman was
                     essential to his views of "life in America," and that Mary Grahame was exactly
                     the embodiment of that youthful vision which he had sought in vain elsewhere;
                     for she united the delicacy and refined grace, with the intelligent mind, the
                     active affections and energetic will, which were necessary at once to please
                     his fancy and satisfy his heart. Mary Grahame could not consent to leave her
                     father to a lonely home, but yet she could not deny that it would be a sad home
                     to her if deprived of the society of him whose intelligent and varied converse
                     and manly tenderness had lately formed the chief charm of her existence. There
                     was but one way of reconciling these conflicting claims. Horace Danforth must
                     live with Mr. Grahame, and so he did, having first obtained that gentleman's
                     permission to enlarge his house, and to furnish it with some of those
                     inventions by which art has so greatly lightened domestic labor, and which had
                     been made familiar to him by his life abroad.</p>
                  <p>Six months had been spent in this abode—six months of an existence of joy and
                     love, untroubled as it could be to those who were yet dwellers upon earth—six
                     months in which the fastidious and world-wearied man learned the secret of true
                     peace in a life devoted to useful and benevolent objects—when a most unexpected
                     visitor arrived in the person of Sir Edward Maitland—no, not Sir Edward. He
                     came to announce that to this title he had no right. That he had remained
                     himself, and suffered his cousin to remain so long in ignorance on this point,
                     had been the result of no want of effort to arrive at the truth, still less of
                     any lingering love of the honors forced upon him. He had never assumed the
                     title, nor suffered the secret of his supposed change of circumstances to be
                     known beyond himself and the lawyer to whom his cousin Horace had revealed it.
                     This lawyer, it may be remembered, had lately succeeded in the care of the
                     Maitland estate to an uncle, who had been compelled by the infirmities of
                     advancing age to retire from business. The old man was absent from England when
                     Horace Danforth left it, and it was not till his return that full satisfaction
                     on the subject had been obtained, as it was judged unwise by Mr. Decker to
                     awaken public attention by investigations which his uncle's return would
                     probably render unnecessary. When he did return, and the subject was cautiously
                     unfolded to him, he spent many minutes in <emph>pishing</emph> and
                        <emph>pshawing</emph> at the folly and impetuosity of young Baronets, who,
                     knowing nothing of the tenure on which they hold their estates, cannot at least
                     wait till they consult wiser people before they throw them away. The entail of
                     nearly two centuries ago, had, it seems, been set aside in little more than
                     one, by an improvident father and son, who had in fact greatly diminished the
                     very fine property so entailed, though most of it had been since recovered
                        by<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7156-00000075"/> the care of their successors.
                     The intelligence thus conveyed to him who was now once more Sir Horace Danforth
                     Maitland, was of mingled sweet and bitter. He could not be insensible to the
                     joy of returning to the home of his childhood and the people among whom he had
                     grown to manhood, yet neither could he leave, without tender regrets, that in
                     which he had first learned to love, and to live a true, a noble, and a happy
                     life.</p>
                  <p>When Mary was first saluted as Lady Maitland by Edward, she turned a glance of
                     inquiry upon her husband and then upon her father, for both were present by
                     previous arrangement; and as she read a confirmation of the fact in their
                     smiling faces, the color faded from hers, and after a moment's vain effort to
                     contend against her painful emotion, she burst into tears.</p>
                  <p>"Your father has promised to spend his life with us, dearest," said Sir Horace
                     Maitland, as he threw his arm around her and drew her to his side.</p>
                  <p>"But this dear home," sobbed Mary; "this people, for whom and with whom we have
                     lived so happily."</p>
                  <p>"All that made this home dear, my daughter, you will take with you to another
                     home."</p>
                  <p>"And there, too," interposed Sir Horace, "my Mary will find a people to
                     enlighten and to bless, over whom her influence will be unbounded, and to whom
                     she will prove an angel of consolation."</p>
                  <p>"And can you carry your American life to your English home?" she asked of her
                     husband, smiling through her tears.</p>
                  <p>"As much of it as is independent of outward circumstances, Mary—its spirit, its
                     aims; for they belong to a Christian life, and that I hope, by God's blessing,
                     to live henceforth, wherever I may be."</p>
                  <p>"And what will become of all our projected improvements here?" she inquired of
                     her father.</p>
                  <p>"I shall not leave this place myself, Mary, till I can find some one
                     like-minded, who will take our place and do our work. To such a man I will sell
                     the property on such terms as he can afford, or if he cannot buy, he shall farm
                     it for me."</p>
                  <p>This last was the arrangement made with one whom Mr. Grahame had known in early
                     life, and who had always been distinguished by true Christian uprightness and
                     benevolence. The terms offered by Mr. Grahame to this gentleman were such, that
                     the conscientious and excellent agent became in a few years the proprietor; and
                     under his fostering care, all those plans for the intellectual and moral
                     improvement of the neighborhood which had been so happily commenced, were
                     matured and perfected.</p>
                  <p>It was nearly a year after the departure of his children before Mr. Grahame was
                     able to join them at Maitland Park. With his arrival Mary felt that her cup of
                     joy was full. It had been with a trembling heart that she assumed the brilliant
                     position to which Providence had conducted her; not that she feared the
                     judgment of man: her fear had been lest in the midst of abundance she should
                     forget the hand that fed her—lest amid the fascinations of an intellectual and
                     polished society, she should forget the thick darkness which covered so many
                     immortal minds around her. But already she had cast aside this unworthy fear,
                     unworthy of Him in whom is the Christian's strength.</p>
                  <p>The early dream of the proprietor of Maitland Park is fulfilled. The softening
                     and refining presence of woman diffuses a new charm over its social life, and
                     while his Mary is to his tenantry what he himself predicted, an angel of
                     consolation, she is to him a faithful co-worker in all that may advance the
                     reign of peace and righteousness, of intelligence and joy, throughout the
                     world.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>A SABBATH in the country, with a Sabbath quiet in the air, and the cheerful
                  sunlight beaming like the smile of Heaven on the earth—how beautiful it is!
                  Donaldson Manor is but a short walk from the church whose white spire gleams up
                  amid the dark grove of pines on our left; at least, it is but a short walk in
                  summer, when we can approach it through the flowery lanes which separate Col.
                  Donaldson's fields from those of his next neighbor, Mr. Manly. Now, however, the
                  walk is impracticable, and all the sleighs were yesterday morning in requisition,
                  to transport the family and their visitors to their place of worship. I was a
                  little afraid that the merry music of the sleigh-bells and the rapid drive through
                  the clear air might make our young people's blood dance too briskly—that they
                  would be unable to preserve that sobriety of manner becoming those who are about
                  professedly to engage in the worship of Him who inhabiteth Eternity. I was
                  gratified, however, to perceive that they all had good feeling or good taste
                  enough to preserve, throughout their drive and the services which followed it, a
                  quiet and reverent demeanor. It may seem strange to some, that I should
                  characterize this as a possible effect of "good taste;" but in my opinion, he who
                  does not pay the tribute at least of outward respect to this holy day, is
                  incapable not only of that high, spiritual communion munion which brings man near
                  to his Creator, but of that tender sympathy which binds him to his
                  fellow-creatures, or even of that poetic taste which would place his soul in
                  harmony with external nature. Let it not be thought that I would have this day of
                  blessing to the world regarded with a cynical severity, or that the quietness and
                  the reverence of which I speak is at all akin to sadness. Were not cheerfulness,
                  in my opinion, a part of godliness, I should say of it as some one has said of
                  cleanliness, that it is next to godliness. Like my favorite, Mrs. Elizabeth
                  Barrett Browning, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>I think we are too ready with complaint</l>
                        <l>In this fair world of God's.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> and like her, I would utter to all the exhortation, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">Let us leave the shame and sin</l>
                        <l>Of taking vainly, in a plaintive mood,</l>
                        <l>The holy name of Grief!—holy herein,</l>
                        <l>That, by the grief of ONE, came all our good.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> But cheerfulness, so far from being incompatible with, seems to me
                  inseparable from that true worship which is the best source of the Sabbath
                  seriousness I am advocating.</p>
               <p>The remarks of the preacher were quite in unison with these thoughts, and pleased
                  me so much that, were it admissible, I should be delighted to dignify my pages
                  with them. By a few vivid touches, in language simple, yet beautiful, he sketched
                  for us the first Sabbath amid the living springs and fadeless bloom and verdant
                  shades of Paradise, when sinless man communed with his Maker and his Father, not
                  through the poor symbols of a ceremonial worship, but face to face, as a man
                  talketh with his<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7156-00000077"/> friend. But all I
                  would say of the Sabbath has been said a thousand times better than I could say
                  it, by good George Herbert, whose words I am sure I need not apologize for
                  introducing here.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>MB. ARLINGTON is a gem of the first water. He reveals every day some new trait of
                  interest or agreeableness. I saw immediately that he was a man of fine taste; I
                  have since learned to respect him as a man of enlarged intellect and earnest
                  feeling; and now I am just beginning to discover that he is master of all those
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">agrémens</foreign> which make the charm of general
                  society, and that he might become the "glass of fashion," if he had not a mind
                  elevated too far above such a petty ambition. This last observation has been
                  called forth by mere trifles, yet trifles so prettily done, with such ease and
                  grace, as to justify the conclusion. He is apt at illustration and application,
                  and has a fine memory, stored brimful of entertaining anecdotes, snatches of
                  poetry, and those thousand nothings which tell for so much in society, and which
                  it is so pleasant to find combined with much else that is valuable. A few evenings
                  since, he kept Annie and me in the library, with his agreeable talk, till so late
                  an hour, that Col. Donaldson, who is the least bit of a martinet in his own
                  family, gave some very intelligible hints to us the next morning, at breakfast, on
                  the value of early hours. With a readiness and grace which I never saw surpassed,
                  Mr. Arlington turned to us with the exquisite apology of the poet for a like
                     fault,<pb n="Illustration" xml:id="VAC7156-00000080"/>

               <p>This evening again, as he placed a candle-screen before Annie, who, having a

               <p>As the others were engaged in very earnest conversation at the time, and I was
                  reading, he probably expected to be heard only by her to whom he addressed
                  himself; but a little romance, such as that of Annie and Mr. Arlington, acted
                  before me, interests me far more than any book, and I brought a bright blush to
                  Annie's cheek and a conscious smile to his lip, by asking, "Where did you find
                  those very apposite lines? I do not remember to have seen them."</p>
               <p>"Probably not, as they have never been published. They were addressed by Anthony
                  Bleecker, of New-York, to a belle of his day, and the lady for whose sake, it is
                  whispered; he lived and died a bachelor."</p>
               <p>Our colloquy was here interrupted by Robert Dudley, who<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC7156-00000082"/> wanted to know if we were to have no story this
                  evening. Robert was a great lover of stories. "Ask Mr. Arlington, Robert," said I,
                  "I have given three stories to his one already."</p>
               <p>"Aunt Nancy," said Mr. Arlington, who had already begun to give me the
                  affectionate cognomen by which I was always addressed at Donaldson Manor, "Aunt
                  Nancy has stories without number, written and ready for demand, but my portfolio
                  furnishes only rude pencilling, or at best, a crayon sketch."</p>
               <p>"Will you show them to us, Mr. Arlington?" asked the persevering Robert, who stood
                  beside him, portfolio in hand. "May I draw one out, as Aunt Annie did the other
                  evening; and will you tell us about it?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Arlington, with good-humored playfulness, consented, and Robert drew from the
                  portfolio a drawing, of which the reader will find a faithful copy in the
                  engraving immediately preceding this chapter.</p>
               <p>"That man," said I, as I looked at the honest face of the rude, weather-beaten
                  fisherman, "looks as if he had passed through adventurous scenes, and might have
                  many a history to tell."</p>
               <p>"He did not tell them to me," said Mr. Arlington. "I know nothing more of them
                  than that paper reveals. It seemed to me that the woman and child were visiting,
                  for the first time, the ocean, whose booming sound was to the fisherman as the
                  voice of home. He was probably introducing them to its wonders—revealing to them
                  the mysteries which awaken the superstition of the vulgar and the poetry of the
                  cultivated imagination. He has given her a sea-shell, and she is listening for the
                  first time to its low, strange music."</p>
               <p>"And is that all?" asked Robert, when Mr. Arlington ceased speaking.</p>
               <p>"All I know, Robert," he answered, with a smile at the boy's earnestness.</p>
               <p>"But did you never go fishing yourself, Mr. Arlington?"</p>
               <p>"Not often, Robert; I like more active sports better—hunting—"</p>
               <p>"Ah! do tell us about your hunting, Mr. Arlington; you must have had some
                  adventures in hunting in those great Western forests I have heard you speak
                  of."</p>
               <p>"The greatest adventure I ever had, Robert," said Mr. Arlington, "was in an
                     <emph>Eastern</emph> forest, and when I was the <emph>hunted,</emph> not the
                     <emph>hunter.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Indians, Mr. Arlington—was it Indians that hunted you?"</p>
               <p>"No, Robert; my hunters were wolves."</p>
               <p>"Oh! pray tell us about it, Mr. Arlington, will you not?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, with the ladies' permission."</p>
               <p>The ladies' permission was soon obtained, and our little party listened with the
                  deepest interest to the thrilling recital which I have called</p>

                  <p>DURING the winter of 1844, being engaged in the northern part of Maine, I had
                     much leisure to devote to the wild sports of a new country. To none of these
                     was I more passionately addicted than to skating. The deep and sequestered
                     lakes of this State, frozen by the intense cold of a Northern winter, present a
                        wide<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7156-00000083"/> field to the lovers of this
                     pastime. Often would I bind on my skates, and glide away up the glittering
                     river, and wind each mazy streamlet that flowed beneath its fetters on towards
                     the parent ocean, forgetting all the while time and distance in the luxurious
                     sense of the gliding motion—thinking of nothing in the easy flight, but rather
                     dreaming, as I looked through the transparent ice at the long weeds and cresses
                     that nodded in the current beneath, and seemed wrestling with the waves to let
                     them go; or I would follow on the track of some fox or otter, and run my skate
                     along the mark he had left with his dragging tail until the trail would enter
                     the woods. Sometimes these excursions were made by moonlight, and it was on one
                     of these occasions that I had a rencontre, which even now, with kind faces
                     around me, I cannot recall without a nervous looking-over-my-shoulder
                     feeling.</p>
                  <p>I had left my friend's house one evening just before dusk, with the intention
                     of skating a short distance up the noble Kennebec, which glided directly before
                     the door. The night was beautifully clear. A peerless moon rode through an
                     occasional fleecy cloud, and stars twinkled from the sky and from every
                     frost-covered tree in millions. Your mind would wonder at the light that came
                     glinting from ice, and snow-wreath, and incrusted branches, as the eye followed
                     for miles the broad gleam of the Kennebec, that like a jewelled zone swept
                     between the mighty forests on its banks. And yet all was still. The cold seemed
                     to have frozen tree, and air, and water, and every living thing that moved.
                     Even the ringing of my skates on the ice echoed back from the Moccason Hill
                     with a startling clearness, and the crackle of the ice as I passed over it in
                     my course seemed to follow the tide of the river with lightning speed.</p>
                  <p>I had gone up the river nearly two miles when, coming to a little stream which
                     empties into the larger, I turned in to explore its course. Fir and hemlock of
                     a century's growth met overhead, and formed an archway radiant with frost-work.
                     All was dark within, but I was young and fearless, and as I peered into an
                     unbroken forest that reared itself on the borders of the stream, I laughed with
                     very joyousness: my wild hurrah rang through the silent woods, and I stood
                     listening to the echo that reverberated again and again, until all was hushed.
                     I thought how often the Indian hunter had concealed himself behind these very
                     trees—how often his arrow had pierced the deer by this very stream, and his
                     wild halloo had here rung for his victory. And then, turning from fancy to
                     reality, I watched a couple of white owls, that sat in their hooded state, with
                     ruffled pantalettes and long ear-tabs, debating in silent conclave the affairs
                     of their frozen realm, and was wondering if they, "for all their feathers, were
                     a-cold," when suddenly a sound arose—it seemed to me to come from beneath the
                     ice; it sounded low and tremulous at first, until it ended in one wild yell. I
                     was appalled. Never before had such a noise met my ears. I thought it more than
                     mortal—so fierce, and amid such an unbroken solitude, it seemed as if a fiend
                     had blown a blast from an infernal trumpet. Presently I heard the twigs on
                     shore snap, as if from the tread of some animal, and the blood rushed back to
                     my forehead with a bound that made my skin burn, and I felt relieved that I had
                     to contend with things earthly, and not of spiritual nature—my energies
                     returned, and I looked around me for some means of escape. The moon shone
                     through the opening at the mouth of the creek by which I had entered the
                     forest, and considering this the best means of escape, I darted<pb n="144-145"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000084"/> towards it like an arrow. 'Twas hardly a hundred
                     yards distant, and the swallow could scarcely excel my desperate flight; yet,
                     as I turned my head to the shore, I could see two dark objects dashing through
                     the underbrush at a pace nearly double in speed to my own. By this great speed,
                     and the short yells which they occasionally gave, I knew at once that these
                     were the much dreaded gray wolf.</p>
                  <p>I had never met with these animals, but from the description given of them I
                     had but little pleasure in making their acquaintance. Their untameable
                     fierceness, and the untiring strength which seems part of their nature, render
                     them objects of dread to every benighted traveller. <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"With their long gallop, which can tire</l>
                           <l>The deer-hound's hate, the hunter's fire,"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> they pursue their prey—never straying from the track of their victim—and
                     as the wearied hunter thinks he has at last outstripped them, he finds that
                     they but waited for the evening to seize their prey, and falls a prize to the
                     tireless animals.</p>
                  <p>The bushes that skirted the shore flew past with the velocity of lightning as I
                     dashed on in my flight to pass the narrow opening. The outlet was nearly
                     gained; one second more and I would be comparatively safe, when my pursuers
                     appeared on the bank directly above me, which here rose to the height of ten
                     feet. There was no time for thought, so I bent my head and dashed madly
                     forward. The wolves sprang, but miscalculating my speed, sprang behind, while
                     their intended prey glided out upon the river.</p>
                  <p>Nature turned me towards home. The light flakes of snow spun from the iron of
                     my skates, and I was some distance from my pursuers, when their fierce howl
                     told me I was still their fugitive. I did not look back, I did not feel afraid,
                     or sorry, or glad; one thought of home, of the bright faces awaiting my return,
                     of their tears if they never should see me, and then every energy of body and
                     mind was exerted for escape. I was perfectly at home on the ice. Many were the
                     days that I spent on my good skates, never thinking that at one time they would
                     be my only means of safety. Every half minute an alternate yelp from my fierce
                     attendants made me but too certain that they were in close pursuit. Nearer and
                     nearer they came; I heard their feet pattering on the ice nearer still, until I
                     could feel their breath and hear their snuffing scent. Every nerve and muscle
                     in my frame was stretched to the utmost tension.</p>
                  <p>The trees along the shore seemed to dance in the uncertain light, and my brain
                     turned with my own breathless speed, yet still they seemed to hiss forth their
                     breath with a sound truly horrible, when an involuntary motion on my part
                     turned me out of my course. The wolves close behind, unable to stop, and as
                     unable to turn on the smooth ice, slipped and fell, still going on far ahead;
                     their tongues were lolling out, their white tusks glaring from their bloody
                     mouths, their dark, shaggy breasts were fleeced with foam, and as they passed
                     me their eyes glared, and they howled with fury. The thought flashed on my
                     mind, that by this means I could avoid them, viz., by turning aside whenever
                     they came too near; for they, by the formation of their feet, are unable to run
                     on ice except on a straight line.</p>
                  <p>I immediately acted upon this plan. The wolves, having regained their feet,
                     sprang directly towards me. The race was renewed for twenty yards up the
                     stream; they were already close on my back, when I glided round and dashed
                     directly past my<pb n="146" xml:id="VAC7156-00000085"/> pursuers. A fierce yell
                     greeted my evolution, and the wolves, slipping upon their haunches, sailed
                     onward, presenting a perfect picture of helplessness and baffled rage. Thus I
                     gained nearly a hundred yards at each turning. This was repeated two or three
                     times, every moment the animals getting more excited and baffled.</p>
                  <p>At one time, by delaying my turning too long, my fierce antagonists came so
                     near, that they threw the white foam over my dress as they sprang to seize me,
                     and their teeth clashed together like the spring of a fox-trap. Had my skates
                     failed for one instant, had I tripped on a stick, or caught my foot in a
                     fissure in the ice, the story I am now telling would never have been told. I
                     thought all the chances over; I knew where they would first take hold of me if
                     I fell; I thought how long it would be before I died, and when there would be a
                     search for the body that would already have its tomb;—for oh! how fast man's
                     mind traces out all the dead colors of death's picture, only those who have
                     been near the grim original can tell.</p>
                  <p>But soon I came opposite the house, and my hounds—I knew their deep
                     voices—roused by the noise, bayed furiously from the kennels. I heard their
                     chains rattle; how I wished they would break them, and then I would have
                     protectors that would be peers to the fiercest denizens of the forest. The
                     wolves, taking the hint conveyed by the dogs, stopped in their mad career, and
                     after a moment's consideration, turned and fled. I watched them until their
                     dusky forms disappeared over a neighboring hill. Then, taking off my skates,
                     wended my way to the house, with feelings which may be better imagined than
                     described.</p>
                  <p>But even yet, I never see a broad sheet of ice in the moonshine, without
                     thinking of that snuffling breath and those fearful things that followed me so
                     closely down the frozen Kennebec.</p>

               <p>"WHAT a noble forest!" cried Annie, as she looked at the engraving which the
                  reader will see on the opposite page, "those old oaks, with their gnarled and
                  crooked branches, look as if they might have formed part of the Druidical groves
                  whose solemn mysteries inspired even the arrogant Roman with awe. This picture,
                  however, belongs to a later period—that of the Crusades, perhaps, for here is a
                  procession in which appear figures in the long robe of the monk, and I think I can
                  discern a cross on that banner borne at their head. But what, dear Aunt Nancy,
                  could you possibly find in our land of yesterday, to associate with such a
                  scene?"</p>
               <p>"Our people may be of yesterday, Annie, but our land bears no marks of recent
                  origin. The most arrogant boaster of the Old World may feel himself humbled as he
                  stands within the shadow of our forests, and looks up to trees which we might
                  almost fancy to have waved over the heads of 'the patriarchs of an infant
                  world.'"</p>
               <p>"And you have seen some such forests, and on the branches of these old trees
                  'hangs a tale' which you will tell us. Is it not so, Aunt Nancy?"</p>
               <p>"I have seen such a forest, and I have a sketch of certain events occurring within
                  its circle. The narrative was given me by my friend, Mrs. H., who was acquainted
                  with the parties.<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7156-00000088"/> You will find it in
                  her handwriting in the compartment of my desk from which you took the
                  engraving."</p>
               <p>Annie found the paper, and I saw a quiet smile pass around as she read aloud its
                  title. Mr. Arlington, at my request, took the reader's place, and we spent our
                  evening in listening to</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The History of an Old Maid.</head>
                  <p>IT is an almost universal belief among those who have faith in man's
                     immortality, that when his spiritual nature has been divested of its present
                     veil—the bodily organization by which it at pleasure reveals or conceals
                     itself—it shall be manifested to all at a glance in the unsullied beauty of
                     holiness, or the dark deformity of vice. Shall our vision extend further? Shall
                     we read the soul's past history? Shall we know the struggles which have given
                     strength to its powers? the fears which have shadowed, and the hopes which have
                     lighted, its earthly path? Shall we learn the unspoken sacrifices which have
                     been laid on the altar of its affections or its duty? Shall we see how a single
                     generous impulse has shaped the whole course of its being, and been as a
                     heavenly flame to which every selfish desire and feeling has been committed in
                     noiseless devotion? If this be so, how many such records shall be furnished by
                     the life of Woman? How often shall it be found, that from such a flame has
                     arisen the light with which she has brightened the existence of others!</p>
                  <p>Meeta Werner was the daughter of industrious, honest Germans, who had emigrated
                     to the western part of Pennsylvania when she was but a child of seven years
                     old. Only a quarter of a mile from the spot on which Carl Werner had fixed his
                     residence dence lived a brother German, Franz Rainer. Franz was a widower, with
                     one child, a son, named Ernest. He was a hard, stern man, and the first smiles
                     which had lighted the existence of the young Ernest were caught from the
                     sprightly Meeta and her kind-hearted mother. The children became play-fellows
                     and friends. It was a wild country in which they lived. A very short walk from
                     their own doors brought them into a forest which seemed to their young
                     imaginations endless; where gigantic trees interlaced their branches, and with
                     their green foliage shut out the sun in summer, or in winter reflected it in
                     dazzling brightness, and a thousand gorgeous colors from the icicles which
                     cased their leafless branches and pendent twigs. There was not a footpath, a
                     sunny hill or flowery dell, for miles around their homes, which had not been
                     trodden together by Meeta Werner and Ernest Rainer before their acquaintance
                     was a year old. Now they would come home laden with wood-flowers, and now they
                     might be seen treading wearily back from some distant spot, with baskets filled
                     with black-berries or with the dark-blue whortle-berries. There were no schools
                     in the neighborhood, but they had been taught by their fathers to read and
                     write their own language, and Ernest afterward acquired some knowledge of
                     English from the good pastor who had accompanied the emigrants from Germany,
                     and who acted as their interpreter when they needed one. Having access to few
                     books, they seemed likely to grow up with little more learning than might be
                     gathered from their own observation of the world around them; but when Ernest
                     was eighteen and Meeta fifteen years of age, circumstances occurred which gave
                     an entirely new coloring to their lives.</p>
                  <p>Franz Rainer had not always been so stern and hard as he now seemed. He had
                     married imprudently, in the world's<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7156-00000089"/>
                     acceptation of that term; that is, he had made a portionless but lovely girl
                     his wife, and in doing so had incurred his father's lasting displeasure. He had
                     been banished from a home of plenty with a small sum, "to keep him from
                     starving," he was told. With that sum and a young delicate wife he sailed for
                     America, and found a home for himself and his boy, and a grave for his wife, in
                     the forests of Pennsylvania. Too proud to seek a reconciliation with those who
                     had cast him off, he had held no communication with his own family after
                     leaving Germany; and it was not till Ernest was, as we have said, eighteen,
                     that the silence of his home was broken by what seemed a voice from the past.
                     After many hindrances and delays, and passing through many hands for which it
                     had not been intended, a letter reached him from a merchant in Philadelphia,
                     who had been requested to institute a search for Franz by his only brother. The
                     old Rainer was dead, and the family estate had descended to this brother, a
                     scholar and a man of solitary habits. Finding himself growing old in a lonely
                     home, and retaining some kindly memory of the brother in whose companionship
                     his childhood had been passed, he wished him to return to Germany, and again
                     dwell with him in the house of their fathers. To this Franz would by no means
                     consent. His nature was cast in too stern a mould to re-knit at a word the ties
                     which had been so violently sundered. He consented, however, after some
                     correspondence with his brother, to send Ernest to Germany, to be educated
                     there; at least, to receive such an education as could be gained in four years;
                     for he insisted that at the end of that time he should return to America, and
                     remain there while his father lived. "After my death, if he choose to return to
                     the home from which his father was banished, he may," wrote the still resentful
                     Franz.</p>
                  <p>And how was this change in all the prospects of his life received by the young
                     Ernest and his companion Meeta? By him with mingled feelings: regret, joy,
                     fear, hope, by turns ruled his soul. The regret was all for Meeta and her
                     mother; they were the sources of all his pleasant memories; and as he gazed
                     upon Meeta's hitherto bright face, now clouded with sorrow, and kissed from her
                     cheek the first tears he had ever known her to shed for herself, he was ready
                     to give up all his fair prospects abroad and live with her for ever. Meeta
                     herself, however, gave a new direction to his thoughts, by generously turning
                     from the subject of her grief in parting, to dwell on the idea of the delight
                     with which they would meet again, and especially on her peculiar pleasure in
                     seeing Ernest come back "riding in a grand coach, with servants following him
                     on horseback, as she remembered to have seen in Germany, and knowing enough to
                     teach Parson Schmidt himself!" After listening to such prophecies, Ernest no
                     longer expressed any desire to remain with Meeta; he contented himself,
                     instead, with promising to return as soon as he could, and with winning from
                     her a promise that, come when he would, she would be his wife. This was not a
                     new thought or a new word to either. They could scarcely tell themselves when
                     the idea had first arisen in their minds that they would one day live together,
                     and be what Carl Werner and his wife were to each other. They had even chosen a
                     site for their house; and Ernest had more than once of late expressed the
                     opinion that they were old enough to inform their parents of their intentions;
                     but the more timid Meeta objected. Now, however, she could refuse Ernest
                     nothing, and before the day of parting came they had made a <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">confidante</foreign> of Meeta's mother, and from her the two
                     fathers had learned the desires of their children. Carl Werner heard the<pb
                        n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7156-00000090"/> story with a smile; but a denser
                     shadow gathered on the dark brow of Franz. For a moment something of his
                     father's pride was in his heart; but his own blighted life rose before him, and
                     he said, "The boy may do as he pleases. No man has a right to control another
                     on such a subject."</p>
                  <p>The sun had not yet risen, though its rays were gilding the few light clouds
                     that flecked the eastern sky, when Meeta and Ernest stood together beneath an
                     old oak which had long been their favorite "trysting-tree," to say those last
                     words and give and receive those last looks which are among life's most sacred
                     treasures. Smiles and blushes mingled with tears on Meeta's cheek as Ernest
                     pressed her to his bosom, kissed her again and again, and promised that his
                     first letter from Germany should be addressed to her, and that in exactly four
                     years from that date he would be again beneath that tree, to claim her promise
                     to be his for ever. The voice of Carl Werner, who was to accompany Ernest the
                     first stage of his journey, startled them in the midst of their adieus; and
                     bursting from the arms of her companion, Meeta plunged deeper into the woods to
                     escape her father's eye. When Carl returned in the evening he handed her a
                     small parcel, saying, "There's some foolery that Ernest bought for you, Meeta,
                     Silly boy! I hope they'll teach him in Germany to take better care of his
                     money!"</p>
                  <p>The parcel contained a very plain locket, with one of Ernest's dark curls
                     inclosed in it. Plain as it was, it seemed to Meeta, as it probably had seemed
                     to Ernest, a magnificent present; yet she valued more the few simple words
                     written on the paper which enveloped it: "For Meeta, my promised wife." Four
                     months passed away before Meeta heard again of her lover. Then there came a
                     letter to her, which was full of the great cities through which Ernest had
                     passed, the home to which he had come, and the new life which was opening to
                     him there. In his descriptions his uncle seemed a very grand gentleman, and his
                     uncle's housekeeper almost as grand a lady. He told of the new wardrobe which
                     had been provided for him, the acquaintances to whom he had been provided for
                     him, the acquaintances to whom he had been introduced, and the studies he had
                     commenced. And in all this Meeta saw but the first steps toward that grandeur
                     which she had predicted for him, and she rejoiced.</p>
                  <p>Four or five such letters were received by Meeta, each full of her lover
                     himself; but they came at lengthening intervals, and during the third year she
                     received from him only messages sent through his father, though every message
                     still conveyed a promise to write soon. The letters of Ernest showed that he
                     had made great advances in scholarship during his residence in Germany, and to
                     all but Meeta herself, and perhaps her mother, they gave equal evidence that
                     his heart was not with the home or the friends he had left in America. But no
                     shadow ever passed over the transparent faith of Meeta. Ernest was to her still
                     the frank, ardent, simple-hearted boy whom she had loved so long and so truly.
                     She was still his promised wife. Her quick sensibility to all which touched him
                     made her feel that there was a change in the tone with which her father named
                     him, and an expression, half of anger, half of pity, on his face when she
                     alluded to him. It was an expression which gave her pain, though she did not
                     understand its meaning; and she ceased to speak of Ernest, lest she should call
                     it up; but his locket lay next her heart, his letters were well nigh worn away
                     with frequent reading, and no day passed in which she did not visit the oak
                     beneath which they had parted, and beneath which she fondly believed they were
                     to meet again.</p>
                  <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7156-00000091"/>
                  <p>During the fourth year of Ernest's absence his letters to his father became
                     more frequent, and sometimes inclosed a few lines to Meeta. To both he
                     expresssd a strong desire to stay one more year abroad, alleging that to
                     interrupt his studies now would be to render all his past labors unavailing.
                     There was scarce a struggle in Meeta's mind in yielding her own almost matured
                     hopes to what seemed so reasonable a wish of Ernest; but the elder Rainer was
                     not so easily won to compliance. Urgent representations from his brother as
                     well as Ernest, did at length, however, induce him to consent to the absence of
                     his son for another year.</p>
                  <p>This was an important year to Meeta. It brought her an acquaintance through
                     whom her dormant intellect was aroused, and her manners fitted for something
                     more than the rude life by which she had been hitherto surrounded. This was
                     Mrs. Schwartz, the wife of a young pastor, who had come to assist Mr. Schmidt
                     in those duties to which his advancing years rendered him unequal. Mrs.
                     Schwartz was a woman of no ordinary stamp. Highly educated, with an intense
                     enjoyment of every form of beauty and grace, she saw something of them
                     embellishing the homeliest employments and most common life with which a
                     sentiment of duty was connected. Severe illness had confined her to her bed for
                     many weeks soon after her arrival, and before she had been able to establish
                     that perfect domestic economy, which renders the daily and hourly inspection
                     and interference of the mistress of a mansion needless to the comfort of its
                     inmates. During this period, Meeta, whose sympathies had been deeply interested
                     in the stranger, nursed her, and planned for her, and worked for her, until she
                     made herself a place in her heart among her life-friends. As Mrs. Schwartz saw
                     her moving around her with such busy kindness, the thought often arose in her
                     mind, "What can I do for her?" This is a question we seldom ask ourselves of
                     any one sincerely, without finding an answer to it.</p>
                  <p>We have said that Meeta had access to few books in early life; we might have
                     added that she had little opportunity of hearing the conversation of persons
                     more cultivated than herself. Thus were the two great sources of intellectual
                     development sealed to her. She had a thoughtful, earnest mind. She loved the
                     beautiful world around her, and the GREAT BEING who made and sustained that
                     world. But if the contemplation of these things awakened thoughts of a higher
                     character than the daily baking and brewing, milking and scrubbing in her
                     father's house, she had no language in which to clothe them, and vague and
                     undefined, they fleeted away like the morning mists, leaving no impress of
                     their presence. Her acquaintance with Mrs. Schwartz, and the conversations she
                     sometimes heard between her and her husband, gave to these shadows substance
                     and form, and awakened a new want in Meeta's soul—the want of knowledge. As in
                     all else, Ernest was present in this. He would doubtless be intelligent, wise,
                     like Mr. Schwartz, and how could she be his companion? Something of these new
                     experiences in Meeta was divined by Mrs. Schwartz, and with a true womanly tact
                     she became her teacher without wounding her self-love. The road to knowledge
                     once opened to Meeta, her advance on it was rapid. How could it be otherwise,
                     when every step was bringing her nearer to Ernest! The elevation and refinement
                     of mind which Meeta thus acquired impressed themselves on her agreeable
                     features. Her dark eyes became bright with the soul's light, and her whole
                     aspect so attractive, that her old friends exclaimed, as they<pb n="156-157"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000092"/> looked upon her, "How handsome Meeta Werner
                     grows, she who used to be so plain!"</p>
                  <p>After a time these superficial observers thought they had found the cause of
                     this change in Meeta's change of costume, for a new sense of beauty had been
                     awakened in her, under whose guidance her dark hair was brought in soft silken
                     braids upon her cheeks, wound gracefully around her well-shaped head, and
                     sometimes ornamented with a ribbon or a cluster of wild flowers, while her
                     dresses were remedelled so as to resemble less the fashion which her mother and
                     her sister emigrants had imported thirteen years before from Germany, and to
                     give a more natural air to her really fine figure.</p>
                  <p>"How wonderfully Meeta has improved," said Mr. Schwartz, one evening to his
                     wife, as he looked after the retreating form of her friend.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and I am truly rejoiced that she has so improved before her lover returns
                     to claim her."</p>
                  <p>"I wish he could have taken away with him such an impression as our handsome
                     and intelligent Meeta would now make. He would have been much more likely to
                     remain constant to her. There must be a painful contrast between the cultivated
                     and graceful women he has known in Germany, and his memory of his early
                     love."</p>
                  <p>"Love is a great embellisher," said Mrs. Schwartz, with a gay smile, and the
                     conversation passed to more general topics.</p>
                  <p>The fifth year of Ernest's absence was gone, and still he came not; but he was
                     coming soon, at least so his father said, though he did not show Meeta the
                     letters on which he founded his assertion. It was the first time he had
                     withheld them; a circumstance the more remarkable, because of late he seemed to
                     regard Meeta with greater affection and confidence than he had ever done
                     before. He now sought her society, and seemed pleased and even proud of the
                     connection to which he had at first consented with some reluctance. It was very
                     soon after the reception of the letter from Ernest to which we have alluded,
                     that Franz Rainer's health began to fail, and that so rapidly, that Meeta
                     feared Ernest could not arrive in time to see him. She was to the old man an
                     angel of consolation, and he clung to her as to his last hope. In pity to his
                     lonely condition, her own parents were willing to spare her for a time, and
                     Meeta, that she might take care of him by night as well as by day, had removed
                     to his house a week before Ernest's arrival. He came not wholly unwarned of the
                     sorrow that awaited him, for he had found a letter from Meeta at the house of
                     the merchant in Philadelphia through whom he had corresponded with his father,
                     tenderly yet plainly revealing her fears, and urging him to hurry homeward
                     without delay. He travelled with little rest or refreshment for two days and
                     nights, and arrived late on the third day at his father's house. It was a still
                     summer evening, and while the old man slept, Meeta sat near him in the only
                     parlor the house afforded, reading by a shaded night lamp. She heard the sound
                     of carriage wheels, and paused to listen; the sound ceased; a shadow darkened
                     the moonlight which had been streaming through an open window, and then Ernest,
                     the play-fellow of her childhood, the lover of her youth, stood before her; but
                     how changed; how gloriously changed, thought Meeta, even in that hour of hurry
                     and agitation. They gazed on each other in silence for a moment, and then Meeta
                     with a bright smile, yet in a whisper, for even then she forgot not the dying
                     man, asked:</p>
                  <p>"Do you not know me, Ernest?"</p>
                  <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7156-00000093"/>
                  <p>"Meeta!" he ejaculated, as he took the hand she extended to him, but dropping
                     it almost immediately, he said anxiously: "My father! he lives, Meeta?"</p>
                  <p>"He does, Ernest, and may live, I think <emph>will</emph> live, for many days
                     yet."</p>
                  <p>"Thank GOD! then I shall see him again!"</p>
                  <p>The conversation had till now been in whispers, but Ernest uttered his
                     ejaculation of thankfulness aloud. There was a movement in the old man's room,
                     a sound, and Meeta glided to his side.</p>
                  <p>"Who were you talking with, my daughter?" he murmured feebly. For many days
                     Franz Rainer had called Meeta daughter, as if he found pleasure in recalling
                     the tie between them.</p>
                  <p>"With one who tells me Ernest has arrived, and will see you soon," said
                     Meeta.</p>
                  <p>"It is Ernest himself. I knew his voice; Ernest, my son!" And the old man's
                     tones were loud and strong, as Meeta had not heard them for days. In another
                     moment, Ernest was bending over his father, and they were gazing on each other
                     with a tenderness whose very existence they had not before suspected. Tears
                     were rolling down the face of the once stern old man, as he pressed his son's
                     hand again and again, and murmured blessings on him, and thanks to GOD for his
                     safe return; and Ernest, as he marked the death-shadow on his father's brow,
                     felt that a tie was tearing away which had been woven more intimately than he
                     had supposed with his heart's fibres. The weeping Meeta composed herself that
                     she might soothe them.</p>
                  <p>"Ernest, I cannot let you stay longer here; I am your father's nurse."</p>
                  <p>"My nurse, my daughter, my all, Ernest; your gift to me, my son, which, thank
                     GOD! you have come in time to receive again from my hands. Take her to you,
                     Ernest."</p>
                  <p>The old man held Meeta's hand clasped in his own toward his son, and Ernest
                     touched it, but so slightly and with a hand so cold, that Meeta looked up in
                     alarm. There was a beseeching expression in the eyes that met hers; a look
                     which she did not understand, and yet on which she acted.</p>
                  <p>"Ernest," she said, "you are fatigued to death, and your father has been too
                     much agitated already. Go, I pray you, for the present; I cannot leave your
                     father, but you will find coffee and biscuits by the kitchen fire, and there is
                     a bed prepared in your own room. Good-night; we shall meet again to-morrow,"
                     she added with a smile to the old man.</p>
                  <p>Ernest gave her a more cordial glance and pressure of the hand than she had yet
                     received from him; told his father that he would only snatch an hour's sleep
                     and be with him again, and left the room.</p>
                  <p>"Go with him, Meeta; you must have much to say."</p>
                  <p>"Nothing that we cannot say as well to-morrow. And now you must take another
                     sleeping draught, for I see Ernest has carried off all the effect of your
                     last."</p>
                  <p>Meeta spoke cheerfully, yet her heart was sad, she scarce knew why. She would
                     not think Ernest unkind, yet how different had been their meeting from that
                     which fancy had so often sketched for her!</p>
                  <p>Franz Rainer fell asleep, and again Meeta returned to the parlor. A lamp was
                     still burning there, and by its dim light she saw the form of Ernest extended
                     on a settee with his cloak and valise for his bed and pillow. At first she drew
                     timidly back<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7156-00000094"/> into the chamber, but
                     as the slight noise she had made before perceiving him, had failed to disturb
                     him, she felt assured that he slept soundly, and an irresistible desire arose
                     in her heart to draw near him, and look at him more closely than she had yet
                     ventured to do. She stood beside him; her heart bounded against the locket, his
                     gift, which lay in its accustomed place, as she marked with a quick eye how the
                     handsome but uncouth stripling had expanded into the man of noble proportions,
                     whose features had, like her own, acquired a new character under the refining
                     touch of intellect. Meeta looked on him till her eyes grew dim with tears
                     pressed from a heart full of emotion, compounded of happy memories and glad
                     hopes, shadowed by disappointment and saddened by doubt. Above all other
                     feelings, however, rose the undying love which had "grown with her growth, and
                     strengthened with her strength." Suddenly, by an irrepressible impulse, she
                     laid her hand softly on the dark locks of waving hair which clustered over his
                     broad brow, and breathed in low, tender accents, "My Ernest!"</p>
                  <p>On leaving his father's room, Ernest had thrown himself on his hard couch not
                     to sleep, but to rest; and when slumber overpowered him, he had yielded to it
                     unwillingly, and with the determination to be on the alert and ready to arise
                     on the first summons. Sleep that comes thus, however it may continue through
                     other disturbing causes, rarely resists a touch, or the sound of our own name,
                     and light as was Meeta's touch and low as were her tones, Ernest was partially
                     aroused by them. He stirred, and she would have retreated noiselessly from his
                     side, but as his eyes unclosed, they fell upon her with an expression of such
                     rapturous love as she had never seen in them before, and in an instant he had
                     encircled her form with his arm, and drawn her to his bosom. In glad surprise
                     she rested there a moment; it was but a moment.</p>
                  <p>"Sophie—my Sophie!" were the murmured words that met her ear, and gave her
                     strength to burst from his embraces and glide rapidly, noiselessly back into
                     the darkened chamber. There, sheltered by the darkness, she could see Ernest
                     raise himself slowly up from his couch, look almost wildly around him, and then
                     seemingly satisfied that he had only dreamed, sink back again to rest.</p>
                  <p>A dream it had indeed been to him; a shadow of the night; to Meeta a dark cloud
                     in whose gloom she was henceforth to walk for ever. Hours of conversation could
                     not so fully have revealed the truth to Meeta as those simple words: "Sophie—my
                     Sophie!" uttered by Ernest in such a tone of heart-worship. Ernest loved with
                     all the fond idolatry which she had thought of late belonged not to man's
                     affections; but he loved another. Jealousy; the bitter consciousness of her own
                     slighted love; the memory of his vows; the crushing thought that she was
                     nothing to him now; that while he had been the life of her life, another had
                     filled his thoughts and ruled his being, created a wild tempest in her soul.
                     All was still around her. The sick man, the tired Ernest slept; and without,
                     not even the rustling of a leaf disturbed the repose of Nature. She seemed to
                     herself the only living thing in the universe; and to her, life was torture. An
                     hour passed in this still, concentrated agony, and she could endure it no
                     longer; she must be up and doing; she would wake Ernest; she would tell him the
                     revelation she had made; upbraid him with her blighted life, and leave him. Let
                     him send for his Sophie; what did she, the outcast, the rejected, there in his
                     house?—why should she nurse his father? She rose and approached<pb n="162-163"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000095"/> proached again the couch of Ernest; she was
                     about to call him, but she was arrested by the expression of agony in his face.
                     His brow was contracted, and as she continued to gaze, low moans issued from
                     his quivering lips. Ernest too was a sufferer; how that thought softened the
                     hard, cold, icy crust that had been gathering around her heart! The bitterness
                     of pride and jealousy gave place to tenderer emotions. Tears gathered in her
                     eyes, and stealing softly back to her sheltered seat, she wept long and
                     silently.</p>
                  <p>"In sorrow the angels are near;" and Meeta's heart was now full of sorrow, not
                     of anger. Sad must her life ever be, but what of that, if Ernest could be
                     happy? Perhaps he suffered for her; the good, true Ernest. It might be that
                     only in dreams he had told his love to Sophie, bound to silence, painful
                     silence, by his vows to her. She then could make him happy, and was not that
                     her first desire? If it were not, her love was a low, selfish, unworthy love,
                     and she would pray that it might be purified. She did pray, not as she would
                     have done an hour before, to be taken out of the world, but that she might be
                     made meet to do the will of her FATHER while in the world. She prayed for
                     herself, for Ernest; and sweet peace stole into her heart, and before the
                     morning light came, she had resolved not to leave the old man who loved her,
                     during his few remaining days, yet not to keep Ernest in doubt of his own
                     freedom. She was impatient that he should awake, and fell asleep imagining
                     various modes of making her communication to him. Exhausted by mental agitation
                     even more than by watching, she slept long and heavily. When she awoke, Ernest
                     was shading the window at her side, through which the sun was shining brightly
                     into the room. As she moved, he looked at her kindly, and said:</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid I awoke you, Meeta, when I meant only to prolong your sleep by
                     shutting out this light."</p>
                  <p>"I have slept long enough," was all that Meeta could say. The old Rainer was
                     awake, and dreading above all things some allusion from him to the supposed
                     relations of Ernest and herself, she hastened from the room and busied herself
                     in the preparation of breakfast. Having seen that meal placed upon the table,
                     she returned to the sick room and begged that Ernest would pour out his own
                     coffee, while she did some things that were essential to his father's comfort.
                     She lingered till Ernest came to see if he could not take her place, and then,
                     as the old man slept peacefully, and she could make no further excuse, she
                     accompanied him back to the table. The breakfast, a mere form to Meeta at
                     least, proceeded in silence, or with only a casual remark from Ernest, scarcely
                     heard by her, on the weather, the rapidity with which he had travelled, or his
                     father's condition. Suddenly Meeta seemed to rouse herself as from a deep
                     reverie:</p>
                  <p>"Why do you not talk to me of Sophie?" she said, attempting to speak gayly,
                     though one less embarrassed than Ernest could not have failed to note the
                     tremulousness of her voice, and the quivering of the pallid lips which vainly
                     strove to smile.</p>
                  <p>But Meeta's agitation was as nothing to that of Ernest. For a moment he gazed
                     upon her as if spell-bound, then dropping his face into his clasped hands, sat
                     actually shivering before her. It was plain that Ernest had not lightly
                     estimated his obligations to her. If he had sinned against them he had not
                     despised them, and this conviction gave new strength to Meeta. She rose for the
                     hour superior to every selfish emotion. Laying her hand upon his arm, she said,
                     gently:</p>
                  <p>"Be not so agitated, Ernest; can you not regard me as your<pb n="164-165"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000096"/> friend, and talk to me as you did in old days of
                     all that disturbs you; and why should you be disturbed at my speaking of—of
                     your Sophie? You do not suppose that—you know that—in short, Ernest, we cannot
                     be expected to feel now as we did five years ago; but surely that need not
                     prevent our being friends."</p>
                  <p>Meeta had been herself too much confused of late, to remark her companion. When
                     she now ventured with great effort to meet his eyes, she found them fixed upon
                     her with an expression of lively admiration and grateful joy.</p>
                  <p>"Meeta, dear Meeta!" he exclaimed, seizing her hand and kissing it. "You give
                     me new life. I have been a miserable man for weeks past, torn by conflicting
                     claims upon my heart and my honor. You had claims on both, Meeta; sacred
                     claims, which I could never have asked you to forego; and so had Sophie, for
                     though I resisted long, there came a moment of mad passion, of madder
                     forgetfulness, in which, abandoning myself to the present, I sought and
                     obtained an avowal of her love. It was scarcely done ere I felt the wrong I had
                     done. I revealed that wrong to her; pity me, Meeta! I told her all—your claims,
                     your worth. To you I resolved to be equally frank, and my only hope was in your
                     generosity. But my father had never suffered me to doubt that your heart was
                     still mine, and though I was assured that you would enable me to fulfil my
                     obligations to Sophie, I feared, I mean, I could not hope, that it would be
                     without any sacrifice; I mean without any regrets on your part."</p>
                  <p>Ernest paused in some embarrassment; but Meeta could not speak, and he
                     resumed:</p>
                  <p>"You have made me perfectly happy, Meeta, which even Sophie could not have
                     done, had I been compelled in devoting myself to her to relinquish the friend
                     and sister of my childhood."</p>
                  <p>"Always regard me thus, Ernest, as your friend and sister, and I shall be
                     satisfied."</p>
                  <p>Meeta had risen to return to the sick room, but Ernest caught her hand and held
                     her back, while he said:</p>
                  <p>"But you must see my Sophie, Meeta; you must know her, and then you will love
                     her too. She will be here soon with her sister, Mrs. Schwartz."</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Schwartz her sister? Then my last doubt is removed, Ernest. She is worthy
                     of you."</p>
                  <p>"Worthy of me!" And Ernest would have run into all a lover's rhapsodies on this
                     text, but Meeta had escaped from him.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto Meeta's life had been one of quietness, of inaction, and now in a few
                     short weeks ages of active existence seemed crowded. One object she had set
                     before her as the great aim of her life; it was to secure Ernest's happiness
                     and preserve his honor. She understood now the coldness with which her father
                     had of late named him. It was essential to her peace that this coldness should
                     not deepen into anger. Not even in her own family then must she have rest from
                     the strife between her inner and her outer life. Sympathy she must not have,
                     since sympathy with her was almost inseparably connected with reproach of
                     Ernest. Time had another lesson to teach, and Meeta soon learned it; that in a
                     combat such as she had to sustain, no half-way measures would suffice, that she
                     must not drive her griefs down to the depths of her heart, shutting them there
                     from every human eye, but she must drive them out of her heart. We talk of
                     feigning cheerfulness, of wearing a mask for the world and throwing it off in
                     solitude, and we may do this for a week, a month, a year, but those who have a
                     life-grief to sustain, from whose hearts hope has died out, know that there are
                     but two paths open to them in<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7156-00000097"/> the
                     universe; to lie down in their despair and breathe out their souls in murmurs
                     against their GOD, and lamentations over their destiny; or, humbly kissing the
                     rod which has smitten them, to go forth out of themselves, where all is
                     darkness and woe, and find a new and happier life in living for and in others.
                     And thus did Meeta.</p>
                  <p>We may not linger over the details of the next few weeks of her existence. The
                     old Rainer died; died blessing his children, Ernest and Meeta, and praying for
                     their happiness. Often would Ernest have told him all; but Meeta kept back a
                     disclosure which would have given him pain. "Do not disturb him now, Ernest,"
                     she said; "he will know all soon, and bless your Sophie from heaven, where
                     there is no sorrow."</p>
                  <p>Meeta returned home, and exhaustion won for her a few days of rest; rest even
                     from her mental struggles; but when the funeral was over, and things returned
                     to their usual routine, she felt that she must prepare her father and mother to
                     receive Ernest in the character in which they were henceforth to regard him.
                     She found strength for this in her lofty purpose and her simple dependence upon
                     Heaven, and her voice did not falter nor her color change as she said to her
                     mother:—</p>
                  <p>"Do you not think Ernest is much altered?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he is greatly improved."</p>
                  <p>"Improved! Well, he may be so to the eyes of others, but—"</p>
                  <p>"Is he not as tender to you, my daughter?" asked the sensitive mother.</p>
                  <p>"That is not it," said Meeta, coloring for the first time; "we neither of us
                     feel as we once did; it was a childish folly to suppose that we should. I have
                     told Ernest that I could not fulfil our engagement, and he is satisfied."</p>
                  <p>Madame Werner looked long at her daughter, but Meeta met the glance firmly.</p>
                  <p>"And is this all, Meeta?"</p>
                  <p>"All! What more would you have, dear mother?"</p>
                  <p>"And are you happy, Meeta?"</p>
                  <p>"Happier than I should be in marrying Ernest now, dear mother."</p>
                  <p>Madame Werner explained all this to her husband, at her daughter's request. He
                     was not grieved at it. "Ernest," he said, "had never valued Meeta as she
                     deserved. He was glad she had shown so much spirit."</p>
                  <p>Meeta had a more difficult task to perform. "Mrs. Schwartz's sister has come at
                     last. She came from Germany at the same time with Ernest, but stopped to make a
                     visit to another sister in Philadelphia, and only arrived here last night. I
                     will go and see her," said Meeta one morning to Madame Werner. She went. As she
                     approached the house, there came through the open windows the sound of an
                     organ, accompanied by a rich and highly cultivated voice. Meeta would not pause
                     for a moment, lest she should grow nervous. It was essential to Ernest's
                     happiness that Sophie should be friendly with her; and the difficulties were of
                     a nature which, if not overcome at once, would not be overcome at all. Meeta
                     entered the small parlor without knocking, and found herself tête-à-tête with
                     the musician; a young, fair girl, delicately formed, with beautiful hands and
                     arms, and pleasing, pretty face. As she saw the visitor, her song ceased. Meeta
                     smiled on her, and extending her hand, said: "You are Sophie—Ernest's
                     Sophie?"</p>
                  <p>"And you," said the fair girl, with wondering eyes, "are—"</p>
                  <p>"Meeta."</p>
                  <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7156-00000098"/>
                  <p>This was an introduction which admitted no formality, and when Mrs. Schwartz
                     entered half an hour later, she was surprised to find those so lately strangers
                     conversing in the low and earnest tones which betoken confidence, while the
                     lofty expression on the countenance of the one, and the moist eyes and flushed
                     cheeks of the other, showed that their topic was one of no ordinary
                     interest.</p>
                  <p>Six months passed rapidly away, and then Ernest felt that he might, without
                     disrespect to his father's memory, bring home his bride. Their engagement had
                     been known for some time, and had excited no little surprise; though perhaps
                     less than the continued and close friendship between them and Meeta. Many
                     improvements in Sophie's future home had been suggested by Meeta's taste, and
                     Ernest had acquired such a habit of consulting her, that no day passed without
                     an interview between them. At length the evening preceding the bridal-day had
                     arrived, and Ernest and Sophie had gone to secure Meeta's promise to officiate
                     as bride's-maid in the simple ceremony of the morrow. They were to be married
                     at the parsonage, in the presence of a few witnesses only, and were immediately
                     to set out on an excursion which would occupy several weeks. They had urged
                     Meeta to accompany them, but she had declined. "But she cannot refuse to stand
                     up with me—do you think she can?" said Sophie to her sister, as she prepared to
                     accompany Ernest to Carl Werner's.</p>
                  <p>"I do not think she <emph>will</emph> refuse," Mrs. Schwartz replied.</p>
                  <p>"You do not think she will!" repeated Mr. Schwartz, in an accent of surprise,
                     to his wife, when Ernest and Sophia had left them. "How does that consist with
                     your idea of Meeta's love for Ernest?"</p>
                  <p>"It perfectly consists with a love like Meeta's; a love without any alloy of
                     selfishness. Dear Meeta! how little is her nobleness appreciated! Even I dare
                     not let her see that she is understood by me, lest I should wound her delicate
                     and generous nature."</p>
                  <p>There was a pause, and then Mr. Schwartz said, hesitatingly, "If it be as you
                     think, Meeta is a noble being; but——"</p>
                  <p>"If it be," interrupted Mrs. Schwartz, with warmth. "Can you doubt it? Have you
                     not seen the loftier character which her generous purpose has impressed upon
                     her whole aspect? the elevation—I had almost said the inspiration, which beams
                     from her face when Ernest and Sophie are present? Sophie is my sister, and I
                     love her truly; yet I declare to you, at such times I have looked from her to
                     Meeta, and wondered at what seemed to me Ernest's infatuation."</p>
                  <p>"Sophie is fair and delicate and accomplished, the very personification of
                     refinement, natural and acquired, and the antipodes of all which Ernest, ere he
                     saw her, had begun to dread in the untaught Meeta of his memory. I am not
                     surprised at all at his loving Sophie, but I cannot at all understand how the
                     simple and single-hearted Meeta can feign so long and so well, as on your
                     supposition she has done."</p>
                  <p>"Feign! Meeta feign! I never said or thought such a thing. A course of action
                     lofty as Meeta's must have its foundation deep in the heart, in principles
                     enduring as life itself. Had Meeta's been the commonplace feigned satisfaction
                     with Ernest's conduct to which pride might have given birth, she would have
                     been fitful in her moods; alternately gay or gloomy; generous and kind, or
                     petulant and exacting. The serenity, the composure of countenance and manner
                     which distinguish our Meeta, spring from a higher, purer source. It is the
                     sweet submission of a chastened, loving spirit, which can say to its FATHER in
                        Heaven:—<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7156-00000099"/>

                  <p>"A state of feeling to be preferred certainly to the gratification of any
                     earthly affection; but I scarcely see how it can accord with Meeta's continued
                     love of Ernest."</p>
                  <p>"That is because you do not separate love from the selfish desires with which
                     it is too generally accompanied. Meeta loves Ernest so truly, so entirely, that
                     she cannot be said to yield her happiness to his, but rather to find it in his;
                     his joy, his honor, are hers."</p>
                  <p>"And can woman feel thus?" asked Mr. Schwartz, as he looked with admiration
                     upon his wife, her cheeks glowing and her eyes lighted with the enthusiasm of a
                     spirit akin to Meeta's.</p>
                  <p>"There are many mysteries in woman which you have yet to fathom," said Mrs.
                     Schwartz, with a smile.</p>
                  <p>To the good pastor and his wife, the next day, even Sophie was a less
                     interesting object of contemplation than Meeta, who stood at her side. She was
                     pale, very pale, and dressed with even more than usual simplicity; yet there
                     was in her face so much of the soul's light, that she seemed to them beautiful.
                     Her congratulations were offered in speechless emotion. The brotherly kiss
                     which Ernest pressed upon her cheek called up no color there, nor disturbed the
                     graceful stillness of her manner; and when Sophie, who had really become
                     sincerely attached to her, threw herself into her arms, she returned her
                     embrace with tenderness, whispering as she did so, "Make Ernest happy, Sophie,
                     and I will love you always!"</p>
                  <p>And now what have we more to tell of Meeta? It cannot be denied that there were
                     hours of darkness, in which the joyous hopes and memories of her youth rose up
                     vividly before her, making her present life seem sad and lonely in contrast.
                     But these visitors from the realm of shadows were neither evoked nor welcomed
                     by Meeta. Resolutely she turned from the dead past, to the active, living
                     present, determined that no shadow from her should darken the declining days of
                     her father and mother. She is the light of their home, and often they bless the
                     Providence which has left her with them. What would they have done without her
                     cheerful voice to inspire them in bearing the burdens of advancing life?</p>
                  <p>But not only in her home was Meeta a consolation and a blessing. The poor, the
                     sick, the sorrowing, knew ever where to find true sympathy and ready aid. She
                     was the "Lady Bountiful" of her neighborhood. But there was one house where
                     more especially her presence was welcomed; where no important step was taken
                     without her advice; where sorrow was best soothed by her, and joy but half
                     complete till she had shared it. This house was Ernest Rainer's. To him and
                     Sophie she was a cherished sister, to whose upright and self-forgetting nature
                     they looked up with a species of reverence; and to their children she was "Dear
                     Aunt Meeta! the kindest and best friend, except mamma, in the world!"</p>
                  <p>How many more useful, more noble, or happier persons than our old maid can
                     married life present? Is she not more worthy of imitation than the "Celias" and
                     "Daphnes" whose delicate distresses have formed the staple of circulating
                     libraries, or than those feeble spirits in real life, who, mistaking
                     selfishness for sensibility, turn thanklessly from the blessings and coldly
                     from the duties of life, because they have been denied the gratification of
                     some cherished desire?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>IT is Christmas, merry Christmas, as we have been duly informed this morning by
                  every inhabitant of Donaldson Manor, from Col. Donaldson to the pet and baby Sophy
                  Dudley, who was taught the words but yesterday, for the occasion. Last evening our
                  readings were interrupted, for all were busy in preparing for this important day.
                  Miss Donaldson was superintending jellies and blanc-manges; custards and
                  Charlottes des Russes; Col. and Mrs. Donaldson were preparing gifts for their
                  servants, not one of whom was forgotten, and Annie and I, and, by his own special
                  request, Mr. Arlington, were arranging in proper order the gifts of that most
                  considerate, mirthful and generous of spirits, Santa Claus. This morning the sun
                  rose as clear and bright as if it, too, rejoiced in the joy of humanity; but long
                  before the sun had shown himself, little feet were pattering from room to room,
                  and childish voices shouting in the unchecked exuberance of delight. I sometimes
                  doubt whether the children are so happy as I am, on such occasions. One incident
                  that occurred this morning would have been enough, in my opinion, to repay all the
                  time, the trouble, and the gold, which Santa Claus, or his agents, had expended on
                  their preparations. Aroused by the voices of the children, I threw on a
                  dressing-gown and hastened to the room appropriated to their patron saint, which I
                  entered at one door just as little Eva Dudley appeared at another. Without being
                  in the least a beauty, Eva has the most charming face I know; merry and bright as
                  Puck's, or as her own life, which from its earliest dawn has been joyous as a
                  bird's carol. She gazed now with eager delight on the toys exhibited by her
                  brothers and sisters, without, apparently, one thought of herself, till Robert
                  said, "But see here, Eva, look at your own."</p>
               <p>As her eyes rested on the large baby-house, with its folding-doors open to display
                  the furniture of the parlors and the two dolls, mother and daughter, seated at a
                  table on which stood a neat china breakfasting set, she clasped her dimpled hands
                  in silent ecstasy for half a minute, then rising to her utmost height on her rosy
                  little toes, she exclaimed, "Oh, isn't I a happy little woman!"</p>
               <p>Dear Eva! a little <emph>girl's</emph> heart would not have seemed to her large
                  enough to contain such rapture.</p>
               <p>Our party has been augmented since breakfast by the arrival of several families of
                  Donaldsons—some of whom live at too great a distance for visits at any other time
                  than Christmas, when all who stand in any conceivable, or I was about to say
                  inconceivable, degree of relationship to the Donaldsons of Donaldson Manor, are
                  expected to be here. Among this host of uncles and aunts and cousins, I was really
                  grateful for my own prefix of aunt, and I heard Mr. Arlington whisper a request to
                  Robert to call him uncle—a title to which I have no doubt he would willingly make
                  good his claim.</p>
               <p>In the midst of this general hilarity, the religious character of the day was not
                  forgotten, and all the family and some of the visitors attended the morning
                  services in the church. We know that there are those who, doubting the testimony
                  on which the<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7156-00000101"/> Christian world has agreed
                  to observe the 25th of December as the birthday into our mortal life of the
                  world's Saviour, and the era from which man may date his hopes of a happy
                  immortality, consider the religious observances of this day a sheer superstition.
                  On such a controversy I could say but little, and I would be very unwilling to say
                  that little here; but I would ask if it can be wrong in the opinion of any—nay, if
                  it be not right, very right, in the opinion of all, to celebrate once in the year
                  an event so solemn and so joyous to our race; and whether any day can be better
                  for such a purpose, than that which has been for centuries associated with it
                  wherever the Angels' song of "Peace on earth and good will to man" has been heard?
                  Another class of objectors there are who complain that a day so sacred should be
                  desecrated, as they express it, by revelry and mirth. To their objection I should
                  not have a word of reply, if it were limited to a condemnation of that wild uproar
                  and senseless jollity by which men sometimes make fools or brutes of themselves;
                  but when they condemn the cheerfulness that has its home and its birth-place in a
                  grateful heart, when they frown upon the happy family gathering once more within
                  the old walls that had echoed to their childish gambols, calling up by the spells
                  of association, from the dim recesses of the past, the very tones and looks of the
                  mother that watched their cradled sleep, and the father that guided their first
                  tottering steps in the pursuit of truth; tones and looks by which, if by any
                  thing, the cold, selfish spirit of the world to whose dominion they have yielded,
                  may be exorcised, and the loving and generous spirit of their earlier life may
                  again enter within them; when they declare these things inconsistent with the
                  Christian's joyful commemoration of that event to which he owes his earthly
                  blessings as well as his heavenly hopes, I can only pity them for their want of
                  harmony with the Great Spirit of the Universe, the spirit of Love and Joy.</p>
               <p>Our Christmas was continued and concluded in the same spirit in which it was
                  commenced,—the spirit of kindly affection to Man and devout gratitude to Heaven.
                  Those guests whose homes were distant remained for the night, and in the evening,
                  before any of our party had left us, Col. Donaldson called on Robert Dudley to
                  repeat a poem which he had learned at his request for the occasion. Robert was a
                  little abashed at first at being brought forward so conspicuously; but he is a
                  manly, intelligent boy, and his voice soon gathered strength and firmness, and his
                  eyes lost their downward tendency, and kindled with earnest feeling, as he recited
                  those beautiful lines of Charles Sprague, entitled,</p>

               <p>YESTERDAY we were more than usually still after the enjoyment of Christmas, and a
                  little quiet chit-chat seemed all of which we were capable, but to-day every thing
                  about us and within us began to settle into its usual form, and this evening there
                  was a general call for our accustomed entertainment. I was inexorable to all
                  entreaties, and Mr. Arlington was compelled to open his portfolio for our
                  gratification.</p>
               <p>"Select your subject," he said with a smile, as he drew forth sketch after sketch
                  and spread them on the table before us. "I have no story to tell of any of
                  them."</p>
               <p>"I select this," said Annie, as she held up the drawing engraved on the opposite
                  page.</p>
               <p>"The Exiled Hebrews," said Mr. Arlington, as he glanced at it. "You have chosen
                  well; that picture tells its own story."</p>
               <p>"But have you really nothing to say of these figures, so noble, yet so touching in
                  their aspect?"</p>
               <p>"No; nothing of <emph>them.</emph> I could tell you indeed of a <emph>dying</emph>
                  Hebrew, whose portrait you may without any great stretch of imagination, suppose
                  you have before you in that turbaned old gentleman."</p>
               <p>"Well, let us hear it."</p>

                  <p>WITH beauty, wealth, an accomplished education, and a home around which
                     clustered all the warm affections and graceful amenities of life, Lilian Devoe
                     was considered by her acquaintances as one of fortune's most favored children.
                     Yet in Lilian's bright sky there was a cloud, though it was perceptible to none
                     but herself. She was the daughter of an Englishman, who, on his arrival in
                     America with a sickly wife and infant child, had esteemed himself fortunate in
                     obtaining the situation of farmer at Mr. Trevanion's country-seat, near
                     New-York.</p>
                  <p>"This is a pleasant home, Gerald," said Mrs. Devoe, on the day she took
                     possession of her small but neat cottage, as she stood with him beneath a porch
                     embowered with honeysuckle, and looked out upon a scene to which hill and dale
                     and river combined to give enchantment.</p>
                  <p>"If you can be well and happy in it, love, I will try and forget that I had a
                     right to a better," said Gerald Devoe, with a grave, yet tender smile, as he
                     drew his invalid wife close to his side.</p>
                  <p>Grave, Gerald Devoe always was; and none wondered at it who knew his early
                     history. His family belonged to the gentry of England, and he had been born to
                     an inheritance sufficient to support him respectably in that class. His mother,
                     from whom he derived a sound judgment, and a firm and vigorous mind, died while
                     he was yet a child, leaving his weak and self-indulgent father to the
                     management of a roguish attorney, by whose aid he made the future maintain the
                     present, till, at his death, little was left to Gerald beyond the bare walls of
                     his paternal home and the small park which surrounded it. He had been, for two
                     years before this time, married to one who had brought him little wealth, and
                     whose delicate health seemed to demand the luxuries which he could no longer
                     afford. For her sake, far more than for his own—even more than for that of his
                     cherished child, he shrank from the new condition under which life was
                     presenting itself to him. When at length his recources utterly failed, and he
                     could no longer veil the truth from his wife, her gentle, tender smile, her
                     confiding caress, and above all, her ready inquiry into his plans for the
                     future, and her earnest effort to aid him in bringing the chaos of his mind
                     into order, taught him that there lies in woman's affections a source of
                     strength equal to all the requirements of those who have won their way to that
                     hidden fountain. It was by her advice that, instead of wasting his energies in
                     the vain struggle to maintain his present position, he determined to carve out
                     for himself a new life in another land. The first step towards the fulfilment
                     of this resolution was also the most painful. It was the sacrifice of his home,
                     the home of his childhood, his youth, his manhood, with which all that was dear
                     in the present or tender in the past was associated. And yet higher claims it
                     had. It had been the home of his fathers. For<pb n="184-185"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000108"/> three hundred years those walls had owned a
                     Devoe for their master, and now they must pass into a stranger's hands, and he
                     and his must go forth with no right even to a grave in that soil which had
                     seemed ever an inalienable part of himself. It was a stern lesson, but life
                     teaches well, and it was learned. He could not turn to the liberal professions
                     for a support, because he had no means of maintaining himself and his family
                     during the preparatory studies. Of farming he knew already something, and spent
                     some months in acquiring yet further information respecting it, before he
                     sailed from England. The determination and energy with which Gerald Devoe had
                     entered on his new career, had won for him friends among practical men, and
                     when he left England it was with recommendations that insured his success.</p>
                  <p>It was a fortunate circumstance for Mr. and Mrs. Devoe that Mr. Trevanion was
                     wanting a farmer on their arrival, for in him and his wife they found liberal
                     employers, and persons of true Christian benevolence, who, having discovered
                     the superiority of their minds and manners to their present station, hesitated
                     not to receive them into their circle of friends, when a knowledge of their
                     past history had acquainted them with their claims on their sympathy. However
                     valuable the friendship of persons at once so accomplished and so excellent was
                     to Mr. and Mrs. Devoe, for their own sakes, they prized it yet more for their
                     Lilian's. She was their only child, and their poverty lost its last sting when
                     they saw her linked arm in arm with young Anna Trevanion, the companion of her
                     lessons and her sports. They could not have borne to see her, so lovely in
                     outward form, and with a mind so full of intelligence, condemned either to the
                     dreariness of a life without companionship, or to the degradation of
                     association with the rude and uncultivated. That this feeling was wholly
                     disconnected nected with any false views of their own position, or vain
                     estimation of the claims derived from their birth and former condition, was
                     evident from their readiness to receive into their friendly regards those in
                     their present sphere in whose moral qualities they could confide, and who did
                     not repel their courtesies by a rude and coarse manner. There was one of this
                     latter class who held a place in their esteem not less exalted than that
                     occupied by Mr. Trevanion himself. This was a Scotchman, living within two
                     miles of Mr. Trevanion's seat, who found at once an agreeable occupation and a
                     respectable support in a garden, from which he supplied the markets of New-York
                     with some of their choicest vegetables, and its drawing-rooms with some of
                     their choicest bouquets. Mr. Grahame was one who, in those early ages when
                     physical endowments constituted the chief distinction between men, might have
                     been chosen king of the tribe with which he had chanced to be associated. Even
                     now, in this self-styled enlightened age, his tall and stalwart frame, his
                     erect carriage, his firm and vigorous step, his broad, commanding brow, his
                     bright, keen eye, and the firm, frank expression of his whole face, won from
                     every beholder an involuntary feeling of respect, which further acquaintance
                     only served to deepen. With little of the education of schools, he was a man of
                     reading, and, what schools can never make, he was a man of thought, and of that
                     sober, practical good sense, and those firm, religious principles which are the
                     surest, the only true and safe guides in life. Mrs. Grahame was a gentle and
                     lovely woman, with an eye to see and a heart to feel her husband's
                     excellencies. And a worthy son of such a father was Michael Grahame, the only
                     child of this excellent pair. He was six years older than Lilian Devoe, and
                     having no sister of his own, had been her playfellow and protector from her
                        cradle.<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7156-00000109"/> Even Anna Trevanion could
                     not rival Michael in Lilian's heart, nor all the luxuries of Trevanion Hall
                     compete with the delight of wandering with him through the gardens of Mossgiel,
                     listening to his history of the various plants—for Michael had learned from his
                     father where most of them had first been found, and how and by whom they had
                     been introduced to their present abodes—and learning from him the chief points
                     of distinction between the different tribes of the vegetable world, and many
                     other things of which older people are often ignorant. But acquainted as
                     Michael was with the inhabitants of the garden, they did not afford him his
                     most vivid enjoyment. Mechanical pursuits were his passion.</p>
                  <p>Before Lilian was four years old, she had ridden in a carriage of his
                     construction, which he boasted the most unskilful hand on the most unequal road
                     could not, except from <foreign xml:lang="FRA">malice prepense,</foreign>
                     upset. To see Michael a clergyman, or, if that might not be, a lawyer, was Mrs.
                     Grahame's dream of life; but when she whispered it to her husband, he shook his
                     head, with a grave smile, and pointed to the boy, who stood near, putting the
                     finishing touch to what he called his "magical glass." This was the case of an
                     old spy-glass, in which he had so disposed several mirrors, made of a toilet
                     glass long since broken, as to enable the person using the instrument to see
                     objects in a very different direction from that to which it appeared to be
                     directed. The fond parents watched his movements in silence for a few
                     minutes—suddenly he called in a glad voice, "Here, father, come and look
                     through my magical glass."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Grahame obeyed the summons, saying to his wife, "He'll make a good
                     mechanic—better not spoil that, for a poor clergyman or lawyer."</p>
                  <p>Michael had the advantage of the best schools to which his father could gain
                     access, and his teachers joined in declaring that his father might make what he
                     would of him, but his own inclination for mechanics continued as fixed as ever,
                     and Mr. Grahame was equally fixed in his determination to let his inclination
                     decide his career.</p>
                  <p>"Let him be what he will, he must be something above the ordinary, or your high
                     people will remember against him that his father was a gardener," said Mr.
                     Grahame to his wife; "and you may be sure he'll rise highest in what he
                     loves."</p>
                  <p>At sixteen Michael Grahame commenced his apprenticeship to the trade of a
                     mathematical instrument maker, to the perfect satisfaction of himself and his
                     father, the secret annoyance of his mother, and the openly expressed chagrin of
                     Lilian Devoe, who had shared all Mrs. Grahame's ambitious hopes for her friend.
                     From this period Lilian became the inseparable companion of the young
                     Trevanions, their only rival in her heart being removed from her circle. She
                     still considered Michael as greatly superior to them, and indeed to all others,
                     in personal attributes, but she could seldom enjoy his society, since he
                     resided in the city; and as she approached to womanhood, and he exchanged the
                     vivacity of the boy for the man's thoughtful brow and more controlled
                     expression of feeling, their manner in their occasional interviews assumed a
                     formality which made it a poor interpreter of their hearts' true emotions.</p>
                  <p>At seventeen Lilian Devoe was an orphan, left to the guardianship of Mr.
                     Trevanion and Mr. Grahame, with a fortune which secured to her a prospect of
                     all the comforts, and many of the elegancies of life. This fortune was the
                     result of a successful speculation made by Mr. Devoe about a year before his
                        death,<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7156-00000110"/> with the little sum which,
                     by judicious management, he had saved from his salary during many years. It was
                     a sum too small to secure to his daughter a maintenance in case of his death,
                     and with a trembling and almost despairing heart he had thrown it on the
                     troubled sea of speculation. From that hour he knew no peace. His life was
                     probably shortened by his anxieties, and when he received the assurance of the
                     successful issue of his experiment, he had but a few days to live. Before his
                     death, Mr. Trevanion had spoken very kindly to him, and both he and Mrs.
                     Trevanion had expressed the most friendly interest in Lilian, and had offered
                     to receive her as a member of their own family, when her "home should be left
                     unto her desolate." Mr. Grahame and his kind-hearted wife had already made the
                     same offer, and Mr. Devoe, with the warmest expression of gratitude, commended
                     his daughter to the guardianship of both his friends. It was winter when Mr.
                     Devoe died—the Trevanions were in the city, and, by her own wish, Lilian passed
                     the first few months of her orphanage at the cottage of Mr. Grahame. Never was
                     an orphan more tenderly received, more dearly cherished.</p>
                  <p>Michael Grahame had now acquired his trade, and had entered into an already
                     established and profitable business with his former master, who predicted hat
                     with his application, and his unusual talent and his delight both in the theory
                     of mechanics and the actual development of that theory in practice, he must one
                     day acquire a high reputation. Perhaps this opinion might have been in some
                     degree shaken by the long and frequent holidays of his young partner during
                     this winter. Michael had never been so much at home since he left it, a boy of
                     sixteen, and before the winter had passed, all formality between him and Lilian
                     had vanished. Again they wandered together, as in childhood hood, through the
                     garden walks; again Lilian learned to regard him, not only as a loved friend,
                     but as a guide and protector.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Grahame saw the growth of these feelings with delight. She loved Lilian,
                     and gave the highest proof of her esteem for her, in believing her worthy of
                     her son. Mr. Grahame was less satisfied. He, too, loved Lilian, and would have
                     welcomed her to his heart as a daughter, but her lately acquired fortune, and
                     her connection with the Trevanion family, gave her a right to higher
                     expectations in marriage, than to become the wife of a mechanic of very
                     moderate fortunes, however great was his ability, or however distinguished his
                     personal qualities. No—Mr. Grahame was not satisfied, and nothing but his
                     confidence in Michael kept him silent. The confidence was not misplaced.</p>
                  <p>The news of Lilian's fortune, and of Mr. and Mrs. Trevanion's offer to receive
                     her into their family, had sent a sharp pang through the heart of Michael
                     Grahame, which had taught him the true character of his attachment to her.</p>
                  <p>"She is removed from my world—she can be nothing to me now," was the first
                     stern whisper of his heart, which was modified after two or three interviews
                     into—"She can only be a dear friend and sister. I must never think of her in
                     any other light." And, devoted as he had been to her through the winter, no
                     word, no look had told of love less calm or more exacting than this. But there
                     came a time when the quick blush on Lilian's cheek at his approach, the tremor
                     of her little hand as he clasped it, told that she shared his feeling, without
                     his power of self-control. Then came the hour of trial to Michael Grahame's
                     nature. Self-immolation were easy in comparison with the infliction of one pang
                     on her. And wherefore should either suffer? Was it not a false sentiment that
                     denied to her the right to decide for herself<pb n="190-191"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000111"/> self, between those shows and fashions which the
                     world most prizes, and the indulgence of the purest and sweetest affections of
                     our nature? Was he not in truth sacrificing her happiness to his own pride? It
                     was a question which he dared not answer for himself, and he applied to his
                     father, in whose high principles and clear judgment he placed implicit
                     confidence. Mr. Grahame was too shrewd, and in this case too interested an
                     observer to be unprepared for his son's avowal of his past feelings and present
                     perplexities.</p>
                  <p>"You are right, my son," he replied to his appeal; "It is Lilian's right to
                     decide for herself on that which will constitute her own happiness."</p>
                  <p>"Then I may speak to her—I may tell her—"</p>
                  <p>"All you desire that she should know," said Mr. Grahame, gently, "when Lilian
                     has had an opportunity of knowing what she must sacrifice in accepting
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"True—true—I will ask no promise from her—nay—I will accept none—I will only
                     assure her that should the world fail to fill her heart, the truest and most
                     devoted love awaits her here."</p>
                  <p>"And in listening to that assurance, without rebuking it, a delicate woman
                     would feel that she had pledged herself."</p>
                  <p>Michael Grahame's brow contracted, and his voice faltered slightly as, after a
                     moment's thoughtful pause, he asked, "What then would you have me do?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing at present—Lilian will soon leave us, and at Mr. Trevanion's she will
                     see quite another kind of life—a life which, with her fortune and their
                     friendship, may be hers, but which she must give up if she become the wife of a
                     mechanic and the daughter-in-law of a gardener. Let her see this life, my boy,
                     and then let her choose between you and it."</p>
                  <p>"And how can I hope that she will continue to regard me with kindness if I
                     suffer her to depart without any expression of interest in her?"</p>
                  <p>"Any expression of interest! I do not wish you to be colder to her than you
                     have hitherto been, and I am much mistaken if Lilian would exchange your
                        <emph>brotherly</emph> affection for all the gewgaws in life."</p>
                  <p>"I will endeavor to take your advice, but I hope I shall not be tried too
                     long," were the concluding words of Michael Grahame, as he turned from his
                     father to seek composure in a solitary walk. When he had returned, he found
                     that his father had gone to the city—an unusual circumstance at that season,
                     and one which he could not afterwards avoid connecting with a letter which
                     Lilian received the next day from Anna Trevanion, before she had risen from the
                     breakfast table.</p>
                  <p>"Papa," wrote Miss Trevanion, "has made me perfectly happy, dear Lilian, by
                     declaring that he cannot consent to leave you longer in the country. I hope you
                     will not find it very difficult to obey his commands in the present instance,
                     which are, that you shall be ready at noon to-morrow to accompany him to the
                     city, where you will find Mamma and your Anna, waiting to receive you with open
                     arms."</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter, Lilian? Does your letter bring you bad news?" asked Mrs.
                     Grahame, as she saw the dejected countenance with which Lilian sat gazing on
                     these few lines.</p>
                  <p>Michael said nothing, but, as Lilian looked up to answer Mrs. Grahame, she saw
                     that his eyes were fixed upon her, and the blood rushed to her temples, while
                     she said, "It is only a note from Anna Trevanion, to say that her father is
                     coming for me to-day at noon,—and—and—" Lilian could go no farther—her<pb
                        n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7156-00000112"/> voice faltered, and she burst into
                     tears. Michael Grahame started from his chair, but a movement of his father's
                     arm prevented his approaching Lilian, and unable to endure the scene, he rushed
                     from the room while his mother, folding the weeping girl in her arms,
                     exclaimed, "Don't cry, Lilian, Mr. Trevanion will not certainly make you go
                     with him, if you do not wish it."</p>
                  <p>"Hush, hush, good wife," said the kind, but firm voice of Mr. Grahame; "Lilian
                     must not be so ungracious to such friends as Mr. and Mrs. Trevanion, as to
                     refuse to go to them when they wish her. Go, my dear child," he continued,
                     laying his hand on her bent head; "and remember that no day will be so happy
                     for us as that in which you come back—if indeed," he added, more gayly, "you
                     can come back to such a humble home, after living among great folks."</p>
                  <p>There was another voice for which Lilian listened, but she listened in vain.
                     Her first feeling on perceiving that Michael Grahame had left the room while
                     she lay weeping in his mother's arms was very bitter, but Mrs. Grahame soothed
                     her by saying, "Michael couldn't bear to see you crying, dear, so when his
                     father wouldn't let him speak to you, he jumped up and ran off. Poor Michael!
                     sadly enough he'll miss you."</p>
                  <p>In about an hour, Michael again sought Lilian, bringing with him three bouquets
                     of hot-house flowers. Two of these had been arranged by his father for Mrs. and
                     Miss Trevanion, and the other was of flowers which he had himself selected for
                     Lilian. She stood beside him while he first wrapped the stems of the flowers in
                     a wet sponge, and then put them into a box to defend them from the cold. This
                     was done, and the box handed to Lilian without a word. As she took it, she
                     asked in a low tone, and turning away to hide her embarrassment as she spoke,
                     "When shall I see you in New-York?"</p>
                  <p>"I shall be in New-York very soon," he replied; "perhaps to-morrow—but we move
                     there in such different spheres, Lilian, that I do not know when we shall
                     meet."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps never," said Lilian, endeavoring not very successfully, to steady her
                     voice and speak with <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nonchalance,</foreign> "unless you
                     are willing to leave what you call your sphere and seek me in mine."</p>
                  <p>"I only need your permission to do so with delight,"—and so charming had her
                     evident emotion made her in his eyes, that Michael could not refrain from
                     pressing her hand to his lips. There was no anger in the flush which this
                     action brought to Lilian's cheek.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Trevanion was punctual to the hour of his appointment, and only descended
                     from his carriage to hand Lilian into it.</p>
                  <p>"You will call sometimes to see how your ward does," he said good-humoredly to
                     the elder Mr. Grahame, but to Michael not a word. He had determined to
                     discourage, and if possible, completely to overthrow an intimacy which Mr.
                     Grahame had acknowledged to him was not unattended with danger. Mr. Trevanion
                     was a man of liberal mind, yet he was not wholly free from the prejudices of
                     his class, which made the highest happiness the result of the highest social
                     position. There is in the mind of man so unconquerable a desire for the
                     unattainable, that it is not wonderful perhaps that this opinion should be
                     entertained by those who do not occupy that position; but to those who do, we
                     should suppose its fallacy would stand out too glaringly to be doubted or
                     denied. We are far from denying the advantages of rank and wealth; but we view
                     them not as an end, but as means for the attainment of an end, and that end,
                     not happiness, except as happiness is indissolubly connected with the<pb
                        n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7156-00000113"/> perfection of our own powers, and
                     with the extension of our usefulness to others. He who, like Michael Grahame,
                     can command the means of intellectual cultivation and refinement, and a fair
                     arena for the exercise of his powers, when thus cultivated, need not envy the
                     possessor of larger fortune and higher station with his weightier
                     responsibilities and greater temptations.</p>
                  <p>Michael Grahame understood Mr. Trevanion's coolness, but he was not one to
                     retreat from an unfought field. Three days had scarcely given to Lilian the
                     feeling of ease in her new home, when he called on her. He had chosen morning,
                     as the hour when others would be least likely to dispute her attention with
                     him. She was at home—Mrs. and Miss Trevanion were out—and a long <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête</foreign> almost reconciled him to her new abode.
                     He had not forgotten his father's advice, nor taken the seal from his lips. He
                     might not speak to her of love, but the nicest honor did not forbid him to show
                     her the true sympathy and affection of a friend. In a few days he called again,
                     and at the same hour; Miss Devoe was not at home, she had gone out with Mrs.
                     and Miss Trevanion. Again the next day he came at the same hour, and the answer
                     was the same. He called in the afternoon at five o'clock, and she was at
                     dinner; at seven o'clock, she was preparing for an evening party, and begged he
                     would excuse her. "I will seek no more," said Michael Grahame at length, with
                     proud determination, "to enter the charmed circle which shuts her from me in
                     the city. They cannot keep her to themselves always, and if Lilian's heart be
                     what I deem it, it will take more than a few months of absence to efface from
                     it the memories of years."</p>
                  <p>A few days only after this determination, Lilian was called down at nine
                     o'clock in the morning, to see Mr. Grahame. Early as it was, the furtive glance
                     towards her mirror and the hasty adjustment of her ringlets, might have
                     suggested to an observer, that she hoped to receive in her visitor one who had
                     an eye for beauty; and the sudden change that passed over her countenance as
                     she entered the parlor in which her two guardians sat in earnest talk, would
                     have awakened strong suspicions that she did not see <emph>the Mr.
                        Grahame</emph> whom she had expected. Mr. Trevanion rose as she entered, and
                     shaking hands with Mr. Grahame, said kindly, "I leave you with Lilian, Mr.
                     Grahame, but I hope to see you again at dinner—we dine at five."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you sir, but I hope to be taking tea with my good woman at home at that
                     hour."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I will hope to see you soon again—you must call often and see your
                     friend Lilian."</p>
                  <p>"Why, I've been thinking, sir, that that would hardly be best for any of us—and
                     to tell the truth, I came to-day to talk with Lilian about that very thing, and
                     if you please, I have no objection that you should hear what I have to
                     say."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Trevanion seated himself again, and Lilian placing herself on the sofa
                     beside him, Mr. Grahame resumed:—"It seems to me, sir, that Lilian has to
                     choose between two kinds of life, that if she tries to put them together will
                     only spoil one another, and I want her to have a fair chance to judge between
                     them. Now, you know, sir, I speak the truth when I say that there are many
                     among the fine gay people whom Lilian will meet at your house, who would look
                     down upon her for having such friends as me and my wife, or even my son, though
                     President B—— says he will be a distinguished man yet."</p>
                  <p>"I do not care for such people, or for what they think," exclaimed Lilian
                     indignantly.</p>
                  <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7156-00000114"/>
                  <p>"I dare say not, my dear child, and yet they are people who are thought a great
                     deal of, and whom, if you are to live amongst them, it would be worth your
                     while to please—but that isn't my main point, Lilian. What I want to say,
                     though I seem to be long coming at it, is, that I want you to see this gay life
                     that fine folks in the city lead, at its best—without any such drawbacks as it
                     would have for you, if you were suspected of having ungenteel acquaintances,
                     and so we shall none of us come to see you—barring you should be sick, or
                     something else happen to make you want us—until you make a fair trial, for six
                     months at least, of this life—then if the beautiful, rich Miss Devoe likes the
                     old gardener and his family well enough to come and see them, she will learn
                     how fondly and truly they love their Lilian."</p>
                  <p>"I had hoped you loved her too well to give her up so needlessly for six
                     months, or even for one month," said Lilian, tears rushing to her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Ask Mr. Trevanion if I am not right in what I have said, my dear child," said
                     Mr. Grahame tenderly.</p>
                  <p>"I will not dispute the correctness of your principles in the main, Mr.
                     Grahame, but I hope you do not think that all Lilian's <emph>fine</emph>
                     acquaintances, as you call them, would be so unjust in their judgment as to
                     think the less of her for her love of you, or to undervalue you on account of
                     your circumstances in life."</p>
                  <p>"No sir—no sir—I don't think so of all—but I want Lilian to see this life
                     without even one little cloud upon it—such a cloud as the being looked down
                     upon, though it was by people she didn't greatly admire, would make. We have
                     our pride too, sir, and we want Lilian to try for herself whether our
                     friendship, with all its good and its bad, be worth keeping. She is too good
                     and affectionate, we know, to shake off old friends that love her, even if they
                     become troublesome—but we will draw ourselves off, and then she will be free to
                     come back to us or not as she pleases. Now, sir, tell me frankly, if you think
                     me wrong."</p>
                  <p>"Not wrong in principle, as I said before, Mr. Grahame, but—excuse me—you
                     required me to be frank—would it not have been better to have made this
                     withdrawal gradually and quietly, in such a manner that Lilian would not have
                     noticed it, instead of giving her the pain of this abrupt severance of the ties
                     between you."</p>
                  <p>"A great deal better, sir," said Mr. Grahame, coloring with wounded feeling,
                     and fixing his clear, keen eye full on Mr. Trevanion,—"a great deal better if I
                     wished to sever those ties—a great deal better if I would have Lilian believe
                     that we had grown cold and indifferent to her. But, my dear child," and he
                     turned to her and taking both her hands, spoke very earnestly—"believe me when
                     I tell you that you will find few among those who see you every day, that love
                     you as warmly as the friends who have loved you from your birth, and who now
                     only stand away from you because they will not be in the way of what the world
                     considers higher fortunes for you if you desire them. To leave you free to
                     choose for yourself, is the strongest proof of love we could give you, and I
                     repeat, when you have tried all that this new life has to give you—tried it for
                     six months—if your heart still turns with its old love to those early friends,
                     you will give them joy indeed."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Grahame paused, but neither Mr. Trevanion nor Lilian attempted to reply to
                     him for some minutes—at length she raised her eyes, and said,</p>
                  <p>"You did not think of this when I left you—what has changed your mind—I will
                     not say your <emph>heart</emph>—towards me?"</p>
                  <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7156-00000115"/>
                  <p>"You are right not to say our hearts, Lilian; but, indeed, even my mind has not
                     been changed—I thought then as I think now—but I could not persuade others of
                     our family to think with me. Now, however, they all feel that they cannot keep
                     up their old friendly intercourse with you without mortification to themselves,
                     and pain to you. And, as I said before, we were none of us willing to withdraw
                     from that intercourse without giving you our reasons for it, lest you should
                     think we had grown indifferent to you."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Grahame soon departed, leaving Lilian saddened and Mr. Trevanion perplexed
                     by his visit. "Singular old man!" this gentleman exclaimed to himself more than
                     once, in reflecting on all that Mr. Grahame had said; so difficult is it for
                     those whose minds have been forced into the straight forms of conventionalism
                     to comprehend the dictates of untrammelled common sense, on points which that
                     conventionalism undertakes to control. One thing at least Mr. Trevanion did
                     comprehend—that on the succeeding six months, depended Lilian's choice of her
                     position and associates for life.</p>
                  <p>"So far Mr. Grahame is right, Lilian," he said to her; "you cannot have a place
                     at once in two such different spheres as his and ours. I always knew that to be
                     impossible."</p>
                  <p>"You called my father friend," said Lilian with unusual boldness.</p>
                  <p>"Your father was a gentleman by birth and breeding."</p>
                  <p>"And he has told me," persisted Lilian, "that he has never known more true
                     refinement and even nobility of mind than in Mr. Grahame."</p>
                  <p>"I agree with him—of <emph>mind,</emph> mark—but there is a want of
                     conventional refinement which would make itself felt in society."</p>
                  <p>"There is no want even of this in his son," said Lilian with a trembling voice,
                     and turning away to hide blush that burned upon her cheek.</p>
                  <p>"Probably not, for Michael Grahame has been for years at the best boarding
                     schools, with the sons of our first families—but we cannot separate him from
                     his father, and from the associates which his trade has given him."</p>
                  <p>Neither Mr. Trevanion nor Lilian ever spoke on this subject again; but the
                     first resolved that no effort should be lost on his part to restore one so
                     beautiful and so accomplished as his young ward to what he considered her true
                     place in society, and the last was as firmly determined that nothing should
                     make her forgetful of the friends of her childhood. In furtherance of this
                     resolve, Mr. Trevanion, instead of retiring to his country seat with his family
                     on the approach of summer, sent his younger children there under the care of
                     their faithful and intelligent nurse, and with Mrs. and Miss Trevanion, and
                     Lilian, set out for Saratoga, at that season the great focus of fashion. Mrs.
                     Trevanion, entering fully into his designs, had attended to Lilian's equipments
                     for this important campaign, with no less care than to Anna's and the result
                     equalled their fondest expectations. Lilian was <emph>the beauty, the
                        heiress,</emph> the belle of the season. Report exaggerated her fortune,
                     appended all sorts of romantic incidents to her history and her connection with
                     the Trevanions, and thus in creased the interest which her own beauty and
                     modest elegance was calculated to awaken. Admirers crowded around her, and to
                     render her triumph complete, one who had hitherto found no charms in America
                     worthy his homage, bowed at her shrine. This was Mr. Derwent, an Englishman of
                     high birth and large<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7156-00000116"/> fortune, whose
                     elegant exterior, and the perfect <foreign xml:lang="FRA">savoir
                        faire</foreign> which marked his manners, made him at Saratoga, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l rend="ti-1">"The observed of all observers,</l>
                           <l>The glass of fashion and the mould of form."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Trevanion looked on with scarce concealed delight.</p>
                  <p>"Why, father! do you wish to see Lilian leave us for England?" cried Anna
                     Trevanion, to whom he had expressed his satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, my daughter, if only in that way I can see her take that position
                     which is hers by inheritance, and from which only her father's misfortunes have
                     estranged her."</p>
                  <p>"But Mr. Trevanion's hopes of so desirable a termination of his cares for
                     Lilian faded, as he saw the reserve with which she met the attentions of her
                     admirers—not excepting even the admired Mr. Derwent.</p>
                  <p>"Among the beauties at this place, Miss L—— D——, the ward of Mr. T——, stands
                     unrivalled. She is an heiress as well as a beauty, but the report is that both
                     the fortune and the beauty are to be borne to another land, in the possession
                     of the Honorable Mr. D——, whose personal qualities, united to his station and
                     fortune, render him, in the opinion of the ladies at least, irresistible."</p>
                  <p>Such was the paragraph in a New-York daily paper, which Mr. Trevanion handed to
                     Lilian with a smile one morning. She read it in silence, and laid it down
                     without a comment, excep that which was furnished by the proud erection of her
                     figure, and the almost scornful curl of her lip.</p>
                  <p>When next she met Mr. Derwent, Mr. Trevanion's eye was on her, for he thought,
                     "She cannot preserve her perfect indifference difference of manner with the
                     consciousness that their names have been thus associated." He was mistaken. The
                     color on Lilian's cheek deepened not at Mr. Derwent's approach, nor did her
                     hand tremble as she laid it upon the arm he offered in attending her to dinner.
                     "Her heart must be already occupied," said Mr. Trevanion to himself, and
                     perhaps he was right in believing that nothing but a deep and true
                     affection—one which was founded on no adventitious circumstances, but on the
                     immovable basis of esteem, could have enabled her to resist the blandishments
                     which surrounded her in her present position. But she did resist them, and
                     still, from the luxurious elegancies, the gay entertainments and the flatteries
                     of fashionable life, her heart turned with undiminished tenderness to the
                     tranquil shades of Mossgiel, and still paid there its willing homage to the
                     loftiest intellect and the noblest heart, in her estimation, with which earth
                     was blessed.</p>
                  <p>September, with its cool, invigorating freshness, had come, when Mr.
                     Trevanion's family returned to the city. To Lilian's great, though unspoken
                     disappointment, the children met them there, and no thought seemed to be
                     entertained of a visit to the country. Carefully she had kept the date of Mr.
                     Grahame's conversation in which he had demanded that she should make a six
                     months' trial of life, freed from the associations which her early poverty had
                     fastened on her. In a few weeks after her return to New-York, the six months
                     were completed. On the day preceding its exact completion, Lilian expressed to
                     Mr. Trevanion her wish to visit Mossgiel. "It is now six months," she said,
                     with a blush and a smile, "since I saw Mr. Grahame."</p>
                  <p>Whatever might have been Mr. Trevanion's wishes for his ward, he had neither
                     the right nor the will to control her actions,<pb n="202-203"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000117"/> and he not only consented to her going, but went
                     down with her himself to Trevanion Hall, where they arrived late in the
                     evening.</p>
                  <p>Lilian knew that the inhabitants of Mossgiel kept early hours, and the gay pink
                     and blue and white convolvoluses, which arched the rude gate leading from the
                     more public road into the rural lane by which their house was approached, had
                     just unfolded their petals, when she rode through it on the morning succeeding
                     her arrival at Trevanion Hall. She had declined the attendance of a servant,
                     and set off at a brisk canter, but soon reined in her horse and proceeded at a
                     slower pace. Hope and fear were busy at her heart. Six months! What changes
                     might not have taken place in that time! Again Lilian touched her horse with
                     her light riding-whip, and rode briskly on till she reached the gate of which
                     we have spoken. Here she alighted to open the gate. As she entered the lane she
                     saw not far in advance of her a boy who had been hired to assist Mr. Grahame in
                     the garden. She called to him, and giving him her bridle to lead her horse to
                     the stable, walked on herself towards the house, which was little more than a
                     hundred yards distant. After walking a few steps, she turned to ask, "Are Mr.
                     and Mrs. Grahame well?"</p>
                  <p>Another question trembled on her lips—but she could not speak it. "If
                        <emph>he</emph> love me, he will be here," she whispered to herself, and
                     again passed on. The road wound around the house, and led to the entrance on
                     the river front. There was a side gate leading to the garden, and there, at
                     that hour, Lilian knew she would most probably meet the elder Mr. Grahame,
                     while his wife was almost certain to be found in the dairy, to which the same
                     gate would give her access; but the gate was passed with a light, quick step,
                     and Lilian entered the house at the front. With a fluttering heart, but a
                     steady purpose, she passed on, without meeting any one, or hearing a sound, to
                     the usual morning room. The door was open; she entered, and her heart throbbed
                     exultingly, for <emph>he</emph> was there. Michael Grahame sat at a table
                     writing. His back was towards the door, and her light step had given no notice
                     of her presence. Agitated by a thousand commingled emotions, wishing, yet
                     dreading to meet his eye, she stood gazing on his face as it was reflected in
                     an opposite mirror. It seemed to her paler and graver than of yore. Manhood had
                     stamped its lines more deeply on the brow since last they parted. But some
                     movement, a sigh, perhaps, from her, has startled him. He raises his head, and
                     in the mirror their eyes meet. In that glance her whole soul has been revealed,
                     and with one glad cry of "Lilian! my Lilian!" he turns, and she is folded in
                     his arms.</p>
                  <p>There was no more doubt, no more fear, on her part—no concealment on his. She
                     had chosen freely and nobly, and she was rewarded by love as deep, as devoted,
                     and as unselfish as ever woman inspired, or man felt.</p>
                  <p>The marriage of Lilian, which took place in three months after her return to
                     Mossgiel, could not but excite some interest in the world in which she had so
                     lately occupied a conspicuous place. When, however, to the great question—"Who
                     is this Mr. Grahame?" the answer, "Nothing but a mechanic," was received—the
                     interest soon faded away, and in the winter Lilian found herself in New-York,
                     with scarcely an acquaintance, except the Trevanions, and she could easily
                     perceive that something of pity was mingled with their former kindness. Yet
                     never had Lilian been less an object of pity. Every day increased not only her
                     affection to her husband, but her pride in him, by revealing<pb n="204-205"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000118"/> ing to her more of his high powers and noble
                     qualities. Those powers had received a new spring from his desire to prove
                     himself worthy of his cherished wife. He had long been occupied with a problem
                     whose solution, he believed, would enable him to increase greatly both the
                     speed and safety of steam navigation. In the early part of the winter
                     succeeding his marriage, with a glad spirit with which Lilian fully
                     sympathized, he cried "Eureka." Before the winter concluded he had been to
                     Washington, and explaining to the officers of our own Government the importance
                     of his invention, sought permission to test it on a government vessel. After
                     many delays, with that short-sighted policy which cannot look beyond the
                     present expense to the overpaying results, the proposition was declined. During
                     his stay in Washington, his object had become noised abroad, and the Russian
                     Minister had opened a correspondence with him and with his own court on the
                     subject. The result of this correspondence was, that in the following spring
                     Michael Grahame sailed for Russia, to test his invention first in the service
                     of its emperor. He was accompanied by Lilian. Their departure and its object
                     was talked of for a while, but soon ceased to be remembered, except by men of
                     science, and those immediately interested in the result of his experiment.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Anna Trevanion married. Her husband, Mr. Walker, was a man of
                     large property, and of social position equal to her own. They spent the first
                     two years of their married life abroad. It was in the second of these two
                     years, and when Lilian had been four years in St. Petersburg, that Mr. and Mrs.
                     Walker entered that city. One of their first inquiries of the American Minister
                     was, "What Americans are here?" and at the head of the list he presented, stood
                     Mr. and Mrs. Grahame. "And who are Mr. and Mrs. Grahame?" asked Mr. Walker.
                     "You say they are from New-York, and I remember no such names of any
                     consequence in society there."</p>
                  <p>"I do not know what their consequence was there, but I assure you it is as
                     great here as the partiality of the Emperor, the favor of the Imperial family,
                     and their association with the highest rank can make it."</p>
                  <p>"But how did people unknown at home work themselves into such a position?"</p>
                  <p>"They did not work themselves into it at all—they took it at once, by the only
                     right which Americans have to any position abroad—the right of their own
                     fitness for it. Mr. Grahame, besides his high attainments in science, and his
                     skill in mechanics, which first introduced him to the Emperor, is a man of fine
                     appearance, of very extensive information, and very agreeable manners, and Mrs.
                     Grahame is one of the most beautiful and cultivated women I know. I repeat, you
                     cannot enter society here under better auspices than theirs."</p>
                  <p>And thus the long-severed friends met in reversed positions, and if something
                     of triumph did flash from Lilian's eyes, as she saw her husband, day after day,
                     procuring from the Emperor's favor, privileges for Mr. and Mrs. Walker, not
                     often enjoyed by strangers, her triumph was for him, and may be excused.</p>
                  <p>After eight years spent in Russia, during which he had acquired fortune, as
                     well as fame, Michael Grahame returned to America, with his wife and three
                     lovely children, and retired to a beautiful country seat within a mile of
                     Mossgiel, purchased and furnished for him during his absence. His father still
                     cultivates his garden, though he has ceased to sell its produce, and through
                     those flowery walks Lilian and her husband still delight to wander<pb
                        n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7156-00000119"/> der, recalling the happy memories
                     with which they are linked, with grateful and adoring hearts.</p>
                  <p>"I shall never object again to any one in whom I am interested, marrying the
                     man of their choice, because he is only a mechanic," said Mrs. Trevanion to her
                     husband, as they were returning one day from a visit to Mr. and Mrs.
                     Grahame.</p>
                  <p>"There, my dear, in those words, <emph>only a mechanic,</emph> lies our
                     mistake, the world's mistake, in such matters. No man is <emph>only</emph> what
                     his trade, his profession, or his position in life make him. Every man is
                     something besides this, something by force of his own inherent personal
                     qualities. By these the true man is formed, and by these he should be
                     judged."</p>

               <p>AGAIN we were all assembled in the parlor in which so many of our cheerful
                  evenings had been spent, but a shadow seemed to have fallen on our little circle.
                  New-Year was now very near, and immediately after New-Year we must separate. Mr.
                  and Mrs. Dudley, with their children, and Mr. and Mrs. Seagrove, with theirs, and
                  Mr. Arlington and I, would all leave within a day or two of each other, and a
                  year, with all its chances and changes, would probably intervene before we should
                  meet again. The very thought, as I have said, threw a shadow upon us, but Col.
                  Donaldson, who is a most inveterate foe to sadness, would not suffer us to yield
                  unresistingly to its influence. If our time was short, the more necessity for
                  crowding enjoyment into every moment of it, he said; we could spare none of it for
                  lamentations.</p>
               <p>"Now, Aunt Nancy," he continued, "if I am not mistaken, you can match Mr.
                  Arlington's story with one quite as romantic, of an extraordinary marriage in high
                  life. Do you remember Lady Houstoun and her son Edward Houstoun—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" I cried, interrupting him, "and the beautiful Lucy Watson too."</p>
               <p>"Then I am sure you must have their story somewhere in your bundle of
                  romances."</p>

               <p>"I believe I have," I replied, as opening my desk I drew out package after
                  package, the amusement of many an hour, which but for such a resource might have
                  been sad in its loneliness. Some were looking fresh and new, and others yellow
                  from age. Among the last was that for which I was searching, and which, though I
                  have no engraving to illustrate it, Annie insists that I should give to the
                  reader, here, under the title of</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Love and pride.</head>
                  <p>A PROUD and stately dame was Lady Houstoun, as she continued to be called after
                     the independence of America had rendered such titles valueless in our land. Sir
                     Edward Houstoun was an English baronet, whose estates had once been a fit
                     support to his ancient title, but whose family had suffered deeply, both in
                     purse and person, by their loyalty to Charles the First, and yet more by their
                     obstinate adherence to his bigot son, James II. By a marriage with Louisa
                     Vivian, an American heiress possessed of broad lands and a large amount of
                     ready money, Sir Edward acquired the power of supporting his rank with all the
                     splendor that belonged to his family in the olden time; but circumstances
                     connected with the poverty of his early years had given the young baronet a
                     disgust to his own circle, which was not alleviated by the rapid changes
                     effected by his newly acquired wealth, and he preferred returning to America
                     with his young bride, and adopting her country as his own. Here wealth
                     sufficient for their most extravagant desires was theirs—houses in New-York,
                     and fertile acres stretching far away from the city, now sweeping for many a
                     rood the banks of the fair Hudson, and now reaching back into the rich lands
                     that lie east of that river. When the separation of this country from England
                     came, the representative of her most loyal family, whose motto was "<foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">Dieu et mon Roi,</foreign>" was found in the ranks of
                     republican America. He could not recognize a divine right in the House of
                     Hanover to the throne of the Stuarts, or justify by any human reason the blind
                     subservience of Americans to the ruinous enactments of an English parliament,
                     controlled by a rash and headstrong minister and an imbecile king. Ten years
                     after the declaration of peace Sir Edward died, leaving one son who had just
                     entered his twentieth year.</p>
                  <p>Young as Edward Houstoun was, he had a man's decision of character, and when
                     the question of his assuming his father's title, and claiming the estates
                     attached to it in England, was submitted to him, he replied that "his proudest
                     title was that of an American citizen, and he would not forfeit that title to
                     become a royal duke." He could only therefore inherit his father's personal
                     property, consisting principally of plate, jewels and paintings. The property
                     thus received was all which the young Edward Houstoun could call his own. All
                     else was his mother's, and though it would doubtless be his at her death, the
                     Lady Houstoun was not one to relinquish the reins of government before that
                     inevitable hour should wrest them from her hand. She made her son a very
                     handsome allowance, however, and, with a higher degree of generosity than any
                     pecuniary grant could evince, she never attempted to control his actions,
                     suffering him to enjoy his sports in the country and amusements in the city
                     without constraint. The Lady Houstoun was a wise woman, as well as an
                     affectionate mother. She saw well that her son's independent and proud nature
                     might be attracted by kindness to<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7156-00000121"/>
                     move whither she would, while the very appearance of constraint would drive him
                     in an opposite direction. On one subject he greatly tried her forbearance—the
                     unbecoming levity, as she esteemed it, with which he regarded the big-wigged
                     gentlemen and hooped and farthingaled ladies whose portraits ornamented their
                     picture gallery. For only one of these did Edward profess the slightest
                     consideration. This was that of the simple soldier whose gallantry under
                     William the Conqueror had laid the foundation of his family fortunes and
                     honors.</p>
                  <p>"Dear mother," said he one day, "what proof have we that those other fine
                     gentlemen and ladies deserved the wealth and station which, through his noble
                     qualities, they obtained?"</p>
                  <p>"Sir James Houstoun, my son, who devoted life and fortune to his king—"</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, noble Sir James," interrupted Edward, bowing low and with mock
                     gravity to the portrait, "I will place you and your stern-looking son there at
                     your side next in my veneration to our first ancestor. Yet you showed that,
                     like me, you had little value for wealth and station."</p>
                  <p>"Edward!" ejaculated Lady Houstoun, in an accent of displeasure, "that we are
                     willing to sacrifice a possession at the call of duty does not prove us
                     insensible of its value."</p>
                  <p>"Nay, mother mine, speak not so gravely, but acknowledge that you would be
                     prouder of your boy if you saw him by his own energies winning his way to
                     distinction from earth's lowliest station, that you can be of him now—idler as
                     he is."</p>
                  <p>"There is no less merit, Edward, in using aright the gifts which we inherit,
                     than in acquiring them. There is as much energy, I can assure you, demanded in
                     the proper management of large estates, and the right direction of the
                     influence derived from station—aye, often more energy, the exercise of higher
                     powers, than those by which a fortunate soldier, in time of war, may often
                     spring in a day from nameless poverty to wealth and rank."</p>
                  <p>The Lady Houstoun's still fine figure was elevated to its utmost height as she
                     spoke, and her dark eye flashed out from beneath the shadow of the deep borders
                     of her widow's cap. A stranger would have gazed on her with admiration, but her
                     son turned away with a slight shrug of the shoulders and a curling lip, as he
                     said to himself, "My mother may feel all this, for she manages the estates, and
                     she bestows the influence—while I <emph>amuse myself.</emph> Mother," he added
                     aloud, "they say there is fine sport in the neighborhood of the Glen, and I
                     should like to see the place. I will take a party there next week, if you will
                     write to your farmer to prepare the house for us."</p>
                  <p>"I will, Edward, certainly, if you desire it, but it has been so long since any
                     of us were there, that I fear you will find the house very uncomfortable."</p>
                  <p>"So much the better, if it give us a little variety in our smooth lives. I dare
                     say we shall all like it very much. I shall, at least, and if the rest do not,
                     they can come away."</p>
                  <p>The Glen was a wild rural spot among the Highlands, where Sir Edward had
                     delighted occasionally to spend a few weeks with his wife and child and one or
                     two chosen friends, in the enjoyment of country sports. For several years
                     before his death Edward had been too much engaged in his collegiate studies to
                     share these visits. During the three years which had passed since that event,
                     neither Lady Houstoun nor her son had visited the Glen, and it was not without
                     emotion that she heard him name his intention of taking a party there; but she
                     offered no opposition<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7156-00000122"/> sition to the
                     plan, and in a little more than a week he was established in the comfortable
                     dwelling-house there, with Walter Os-good, Philip Van Schaick, and Peter
                     Schuyler, companions who were easily persuaded to leave the somewhat formal
                     circles of the city for a few days of adventure in the country. They had
                     arrived late in the night, and, wearied by fifteen hours' confinement on board
                     a small sloop, the visitors slept late the next morning, while Edward Houstoun,
                     haunted by tender memories, was early awake and abroad. Standing on the porch,
                     he looked forth through the gray light of the early dawn on hill and dale and
                     river, endeavoring to recall the feelings with which he had gazed on them seven
                     years before. Then he was a boy of scarce sixteen, eager only for the holiday
                     sport or the distinction of the school-room—now, he stood there—a boy still,
                     his heart indignantly pronounced, though he had numbered nearly twenty-three
                     years. Edward Houstoun was beginning to wake to somewhat of noble scorn in
                     viewing his own position—beginning to feel that to amuse himself was an object
                     hardly worthy a <emph>man's</emph> life. Turning forcibly from such thoughts,
                     he sprang down the steps, and pursued a path leading by the orchard and through
                     a flowery lane, toward the dwelling of the farmer to whom the management of the
                     Glen had been intrusted, first by Sir Edward and afterwards by Lady Houstoun.
                     The sun was just touching with a sapphire tint the few clouds that specked the
                     eastern sky; the branches of the wild rose and mountain laurel which skirted
                     the lane on the right were heavy with the dews of night, and the birds seemed
                     caroling their earliest song in the orchard and clover-field on the left, yet
                     the farmer's horses were already harnessed to the wagon, and through the open
                     door of the house Edward Houstoun as he approached caught a glimpse of Farmer
                     Pye himself and his men seated at breakfast. As he was not perceived by them,
                     he passed on, without interrupting them, to the dairy, where the good dame was
                     busy with her white pails and bright pans. A calico bonnet with a very deep
                     front concealed his approach from Mrs. Pye until he stood beside her; but there
                     was one within the dairy who saw him, and whose coquettish movement in
                     snatching from her glossy brown ringlets a bonnet of the same unbecoming shape
                     with that of Mrs. Pye, did not escape his observation.</p>
                  <p>"Well, now—did I ever see the like! Why, Mr. Edward, you've grown clean out of
                     a body's memory—but after all nobody couldn't help knowing you that ever seen
                     your papa, good gentleman—how much you are like him!"</p>
                  <p>Thus ran on Dame Pye, while Edward, except when compelled by a question to
                     attend to her, was wondering who the fair girl could be, who was separated from
                     her companion not less by the tasteful arrangement of her dress—simple and even
                     coarse as it was in its material—and by a certain grace of movement, than by
                     her delicate beauty. Her form was slender in proportion to its height, yet gave
                     in its graceful outline promise of a development "rich in all woman's
                     loveliness," and her face, with its dark starry eyes, its clear, transparent
                     skin, and rich, waving curls of glossy brown, recalled so vividly to Edward
                     Houstoun's memory his favorite description of beauty, that he repeated almost
                     audibly:— <q>

                  <p>His admiration, if not audible, was sufficiently evident to its object—at least
                     so we interpret her tremulous and uncertain movements, the eloquent blood which
                     glowed in her cheeks, and the mistakes which at length aroused Mrs. Pye's
                     attention.</p>
                  <p>"Why, Lucy! what under the sun and earth's the matter with you, child?
                     Dear—dear—to go putting the cream into the new milk, instead of emptying it
                     into the churn! There—there—child—better go in now—I'll finish—and just tell
                     Mr. Pye that Mr. Edward is here," said Mrs. Pye, fearful of some new
                     accident.</p>
                  <p>The discarded bonnet was put on with a heightened color, and the young girl
                     moved rapidly yet gracefully toward the house.</p>
                  <p>"I did not remember you had a daughter, Mrs. Pye," said Edward Houston, as she
                     disappeared.</p>
                  <p>"And I haven't a daughter—only the two boys, Sammy and Isaac—good big boys they
                     are now, and help their father quite some—but this girl's none of mine, though
                     I'm sure I love her 'most as well—she's so pretty and nice and has such handy
                     ways, though what could have tempted her to put the cream in the new milk just
                     now, I'm sure I can't tell."</p>
                  <p>"But who is she, Mrs. Pye?"</p>
                  <p>"Who is she! Why, sure, and did you never hear of Lucy Watson? Oh! here's Mr.
                     Pye."</p>
                  <p>Edward Houstoun was too much interested in learning something more of Lucy
                     Watson, not to find a sufficient reason for lingering behind the farmer, who
                     was impatient to be in his hay-field. Mrs. Pye was communicative, and he soon
                     learned all she knew—that Lucy was the daughter of a soldier belonging to a
                     company commanded by Sir Edward Houstoun during the war—that this soldier had
                     received his death wound in defending his commander from a sword-cut, and that
                     Sir Edward had always considered his widow and only child as his especial
                     charge. The widow had soon followed her husband to the grave, and the child had
                     been placed by Sir Edward with the wife of a country clergyman. To Mr. and Mrs.
                     Merton, Lucy had been as an own and only daughter.</p>
                  <p>"The good old people made quite a lady of her," said Mrs. Pye. "She can read
                     and write equal to the parson himself, and I've hearn folks say that her
                     'broidery and music playin' was better than Mrs. Merton's own; but, poor thing!
                     Mrs. Merton died, and still the parson begged Sir Edward to let her stay with
                     him—she was all that was left now, he said—so Sir Edward let her stay. Mr.
                     Merton died a year ago, and when Mr. Pye wrote to the lady—that's your mother,
                     Mr. Edward—about her, she said she'd better come here and stay with us, and she
                     would pay her board, and give her money for clothes, and five thousand dollars
                     beside, whenever she should get married. I'm sure she's welcome to stay, if it
                     was without pay, for we all love her, but, somehow, it don't seem the right
                     place for her—and, as to marrying, I don't think she'll ever marry any body
                     around her, for, kind-spoken as she is, they wouldn't any of them dare to ask
                     her, though they're all in love with her beautiful face."</p>
                  <p>In a week Edward Houstoun's friends had grown weary of ruralizing—they found no
                     longer any music in the crack of a fowling-piece, or any enjoyment in the dying
                     agonies of the feathered tribes, and, having resisted all their persuasions to
                     return with them, he was left alone.</p>
                  <p>"I shall report you as love-sick, or brain-sick, reclining by<pb n="216-217"

                  <p>"Your suspicions of what—lunacy or love?" asked Edward Houstoun.</p>
                  <p>"A distinction without a difference—they are equivalent terms."</p>
                  <p>Thus jested his friends, and thus jested Edward Houstoun with them—well assured
                     that no gleam of the truth had shone on them—that they never supposed his
                     visits at Farmer Pye's possessed any greater attraction than could be derived
                     from the farmer's details of improvements made at the Glen, of the increased
                     value of lands, or the proceeds of the last year's crop. They had never seen
                     Lucy Watson, and how could they suspect that while the farmer smoked his pipe
                     at the door, and the good dame bustled about her household concerns, he sat
                     watching with enamored eyes the changes of a countenance full of intelligence
                     and sensibility, and listening with charmed ears to a soft, musical voice
                     recounting, with all the simple eloquence of genuine feeling obligations to the
                     father whose memory was with him almost an idolatry. Still less could they
                     divine that Shakspeare and Milton and Spenser were indeed often read beside a
                     purling stream, and within the dense shadow of a grove of oak and chestnut
                     trees—not to Nymph or Dryad, but to a "mortal being of earth's mould," <q>

                  <p>Edward Houstoun held a book in his hand, but it had long been closed, while he
                     was engaged in a far more interesting study. He had with a delicate tact won
                     his companion to speak as she had never done before of herself—not of the few
                     events of her short life, for these were already known to him, but of the
                     influence of those events on feeling and character. Tenderness looked forth
                     without disguise from the earnest eyes which were fastened on her, as he said,
                     "You say, Lucy, that you have found friends every where, have met only
                     kindness, and yet you weep—you are sad."</p>
                  <p>"Do not think me ungrateful," she replied. "I have indeed found friends and
                     kindness—but these give exercise only to my gratitude—stronger, tenderer
                     affections I have, which no father, or mother, or brother, or sister, will ever
                     call forth."</p>
                  <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7156-00000125"/>
                  <p>"Nay, Lucy, were you not adopted by my father, and am I not your brother?"</p>
                  <p>A glance whose brightness melted into tears was her only answer.</p>
                  <p>"Fie! fie! tears again! I shall have to scold my sister," said Edward Houstoun.
                     "What complaint can you make now that I have found you a brother?"</p>
                  <p>Lucy laughed, but soon her face grew grave, and, after a thoughtful pause, she
                     said, "I believe those cannot be quite happy who feel that they have nothing to
                     do in the world. Better be the poorest drudge, with powers fitted to your
                     station, than to be as I am, an idler—a mere looker-on at the world."</p>
                  <p>"Why, Lucy! what else am I?"</p>
                  <p>"You! You, with fortune to bless, and influence to guide hundreds! What are
                     you? God's representative to your less fortunate fellow-creatures—the steward
                     of his bounty. Oh! be sure that you use your gifts faithfully."</p>
                  <p>Lucy spoke solemnly, and it was with no light accent that Edward Houstoun
                     replied—"You mistake, Lucy—you mistake—I am in truth no less an idler than
                     yourself—a looker-on, with no part in the game of life. To the Lady Houstoun
                     belong both the fortune and the influence." A mocking smile had risen to his
                     lip, but, as he caught her look of surprise, it passed away, leaving a gentle
                     gravity in its place, while he continued—"Do not think I mean to complain of my
                     mother, Lucy. She has been ever affectionate and indulgent to me. She leaves me
                     no want that she can perceive. My purse is always full, and my actions
                     unrestrained. I suppose I ought to be happy."</p>
                  <p>"And are you not happy?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Lucy, no! There has long been a vague restlessness and dissatisfaction
                     about me—and, now, your words have thrown light on its cause. I am weary of the
                     perpetual holiday which life has been to me since I left the walls of a
                     college. I want to be doing—I want an object—something for which to strive and
                     hope and fear—what shall it be, Lucy?"</p>
                  <p>"I have heard Mr. Merton say that no one could choose for another his aims in
                     life, but were I choosing for myself, it should be something that would connect
                     me with the minds of others—something by which I could do service to their
                     spiritual beings. Were I a man, I should like to write books—such books as
                     would give counsel and comfort to erring and sad hearts—"</p>
                  <p>Edward Houstoun shook his head—"Even had I an author's gifts, Lucy, that would
                     not do for me—I must have action in my life—"</p>
                  <p>"What say you to the pulpit?"</p>
                  <p>"The noblest of all employments, Lucy—but it is a heavenly employment, and
                     needs a heavenly spirit. I would not dare to think of that. Try again—"</p>
                  <p>"The law? Ah! now I see I have chosen rightly—you will be a lawyer—a great
                     lawyer, like Mr. Patrick Henry."</p>
                  <p>"You have spoken, Lucy—and I will do my best to fulfil your prophecy. I may not
                     be a Patrick Henry—two such men belong not to one age—but I may at least hew
                     out for myself a place among men, where I may stand with a man's freedom of
                     thought and action. The very decision has emancipated me—has emboldened me to
                     speak what a moment since I scarce dared to think—nay, turn not from me,
                     beloved—oh how passionately beloved! Life now has its object for me, Lucy—your
                     love—for that I will strive—hope—whisper me that I need not fear—that when I
                     have a right to claim my bride—"</p>

                  <p>When Edward Houstoun commenced this passionate apostrophe, he had clasped
                     Lucy's hand, and, overcome by his emotions and her own—forgetting all but his
                     love—conscious only of a bewildering joy—she had suffered it to rest for one
                     instant in his clasp. It was but for one instant—the next, struggling from him
                     as he strove to retain her, she started to her feet, and stood leaning against
                     the trunk of the tree that overshadowed them, with her face hidden by her
                     clasped hands. He rose and drew near, saying, in low, tremulous tones—"Lucy,
                     what means this?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Houstoun," she exclaimed, removing her hands from her face, and wringing
                     them in passionate sorrow—"how could you speak those words?"</p>
                  <p>"Wherefore should I not speak them—are they so terrible to you, Lucy?"</p>
                  <p>"Can they be otherwise, since they must separate us for ever? Think you that
                     the Lady Houstoun would endure that the creature of her bounty should become
                     the wife of her son?"</p>
                  <p>"I asked, Lucy, that you would promise to be mine when I had won a right to act
                     independently of the Lady Houstoun's opinions."</p>
                  <p>"Has a son ever a right to act independently of a mother?"</p>
                  <p>"Is the obedience of a child to be exacted from a man? Is his happiness ever to
                     be at the mercy of another's prejudices? Does there never come a period when he
                     may be permitted to judge for himself?"</p>
                  <p>Edward Houstoun spoke with indignant emphasis.</p>
                  <p>"Look not so sternly—speak not so angrily," exclaimed Lucy. "I cannot answer
                     your questions—but my obligations, at least, are irreversible—they belong to
                     the irrevocable past, and while I retain their memory I can never—"</p>
                  <p>"Hush—hush, Lucy! you will drive me mad. Is my happiness of less value in your
                     eyes than the few paltry dollars my mother expended for you?"</p>
                  <p>"Shall I, serpent-like, sting the hand that has fed me? No! no! would I had
                     never heard those words. We were so happy—you will be happy again—but I—leave
                     me, I pray you, for we must part now and for ever—oh! leave me."</p>
                  <p>"No, Lucy, we will never part—I will never leave you."</p>
                  <p>He would again have drawn her to his side, but at his touch, Lucy roused
                     herself, and with a wild, half-frenzied effort, breaking from him, she rushed
                     rapidly, blindly forward. He would have followed her, but stumbling against the
                     root of a tree, before he could recover himself she was at the outskirts of the
                     wood, in sight of the farm-house, and though he might overtake he could not
                     detain her. He returned home, not overwhelmed with disappointment, but with joy
                     throbbing at his heart, and hope beaming in his eyes. Lucy loved him—of that he
                     felt assured—and bucklered by that assurance he could stand against the world.
                     Life was before him—a life not of sickly pleasures and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >ennui</foreign> breeding indolence—but a life of contest and struggle and
                     labor, perhaps even of exhausting labor, yet a life which should awaken and
                     discipline his powers; a life of victory and of repose—sweet because won with
                     effort—a life to which Lucy's love should give its crowning joy. Such are
                     youth's dreams. In his case these dreams were somewhat rudely dispelled by a
                     summons from his mother's physician. Lady Houstoun was ill—very ill—he must not
                     delay, said the physician; and he did not; yet a hastily pencilled line told
                     that even at this moment Lucy was not forgotten—it was a farewell which
                     breathed love and faith and hope.</p>
                  <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7156-00000127"/>
                  <p>On Edward Houstoun's arrival in New-York, he found his mother already
                     recovering from the acute attack which had endangered her life and occasioned
                     his recall. He soon unfolded to her his new views of life, and the career which
                     he had marked out for himself. New views indeed—new and incomprehensible to
                     Lady Houstoun! She saw not that the life of indulgence, the perpetual gala-day,
                     which she anticipated for her son, would have condemned him to see his highest
                     powers dwindle away and die in the lethargy of inaction, or to waste in
                     repinings against fate those energies given to command success. Time moderated
                     her astonishment, and quiet perseverance subdued her opposition—subdued it the
                     more readily, perhaps, from the knowledge that her son could accomplish his
                     designs without her aid, by turning into money the plate, jewels and pictures
                     received from his father. Edward Houstoun's first act, after securing the
                     execution of his designs, was to inform Lucy of the progress he had made. His
                     own absence from New-York at this time would have excited his mother's
                     surprise, and might have aroused her suspicions, but the haste with which he
                     had left the Glen furnished him with a plausible excuse for sending his own man
                     to look after clothing, books, &amp;c., that had been forgotten, and by him a
                     letter could, he knew, be safely sent.</p>
                  <p>A few days brought back to him his own letter, with the intelligence that Lucy
                     had left Farmer Pye's family. Where she had gone, they could not, or would not
                     tell. Setting all fears at defiance, he went himself to the Glen—he sounded and
                     examined and cross-examined every member of the farmer's family; but in vain
                     were his efforts. He only learned that she had declared her intention of
                     supporting herself by her own exertions, instead of continuing dependent on the
                     Lady Houstoun—that she had returned turned the lady's last donation, through
                     the farmer, with many expressions of gratitude, and that she had left home for
                     the house of an acquaintance in New-York, from whom she hoped to receive advice
                     and assistance in the accomplishment of her intentions. She had mentioned
                     neither the name nor place of residence of this friend, and though she had
                     written once to the good farmer, she had only informed that she had found a
                     home and employment, without reference to any person or place. Edward asked to
                     see the letter—it was brought, but the post-mark told no secret—it was that of
                     the nearest post-town, and the farmer, opening the letter, showed that Lucy had
                     said she had requested the bearer to drop it into that office. Who that bearer
                     was, none knew. Bitter was the disappointment of Edward Houstoun. A beautiful
                     vision had crossed his path, had awakened his noblest impulses, kindled his
                     passionate devotion, and then vanished for ever. But she had left ineradicable
                     traces of her presence. His awakened energies, his passionate longings, his
                     altered life, all gave assurance that she had been—that the bright ideal of
                     womanly beauty and tenderness, and gentleness and firmness, which lived in his
                     memory, was no dream of fancy. He anticipated little pleasure now from the
                     pursuits on which he had lately determined, but his pride forbade him to
                     relinquish them, and when once they had been commenced, finding in mental
                     occupation his Lethe, he abandoned himself to them with all his accustomed
                     ardor.</p>
                  <p>Two years passed away with Edward Houstoun in the most intense intellectual
                     action, and in deathlike torpor of the affections. From the last his mother
                     might have saved him, had not her want of sympathy with his pursuits occasioned
                     a barrier of reserve and coolness to arise between them fatal to her
                        influence.<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7156-00000128"/> During this time no
                     token of Lucy's existence had reached him, and it was with such a thrill as
                     might have welcomed a visitant from the dead, that, one morning as he left his
                     own house to proceed to the office in which he pursued his studies, he saw
                     before him at the distance of a block, yet without any intervening object to
                     interrupt his view of her, a form and face resembling hers, though thinner and
                     paler. The lady was approaching him, with slow and languid steps, but as her
                     eyes were fixed upon the ground she did not perceive him, and just as his
                     throbbing heart exclaimed "It is Lucy," and he sprang forward to greet her, she
                     entered a house and the door closed on her. The inmates of that house were but
                     slightly known to him, as they had only lately moved into the street, yet he
                     hesitated not an instant in ringing the bell, and inquiring of the servant who
                     presented himself at the door, for Miss Watson.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Watson, sir?" repeated the man, "there is no such person living
                     here."</p>
                  <p>"She may not live here, but I saw her enter your door, and I wish to speak to
                     her." At this moment Lucy crossed the hall at its further end, and he sprang
                     forward, exclaiming, "Lucy—Miss Watson—thank Heaven I see you once more!"</p>
                  <p>A slight scream from Lucy, and the tremor which shook her frame showed her
                     recognition of him. She leaned for an instant against the wall, too faint for
                     speech or action, while he clasped her hand in his; but a voice broke in upon
                     his raptures and her agitation—a sharp, angry voice, coming from a lady who,
                     leaning over the balustrade of the stairs, had seen and heard all that was
                     passing below.</p>
                  <p>"Lucy—Lucy—come up here—I am waiting for you—this is certainly very
                     extraordinary conduct—very extraordinary indeed."</p>
                  <p>"You shall not go," said Edward Houstoun, while the red blood flushed to his
                     brow at the thought that his Lucy could be thus ordered. Lucy's face glowed
                     too, and there was a proud flash from her eye, yet she resisted his efforts to
                     detain her, and when he placed himself before her to prevent her leaving him,
                     she opened a door near her, and though he followed her quickly through it, he
                     was just in time to see her rushing up a private staircase. He would not leave
                     the house without an interview, and going into one of the parlors, he rang the
                     bell, and requested to see Mrs. Blakely, the lady of the house. She came,
                     looking very haughty and very angry. He apologized for his intrusion, but
                     expressed a wish to see a young lady, Miss Watson, who was, he perceived, under
                     her care. With a yet haughtier air, Mrs. Blakely replied, "I am not acquainted
                     with any young <emph>lady</emph> of the name of Watson. Lucy Watson, the girl
                     whom you met in the hall just now—is my seamstress. If you wish to see her, I
                     will send her down to you, though I do not generally allow my servants to
                     receive their visitors here."</p>
                  <p>"I shall be happy to see her wherever you please," was Edward Houstoun's very
                     truthful reply.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Blakely left him, and he stationed himself at the door to watch for Lucy.
                     Minutes, which seemed to him hours, passed, and she came not. At length, as he
                     was about to ring again, steps were heard approaching; he turned quickly, but
                     it was not Lucy. The girl who entered handed him a sealed note. He tore it open
                     and read—"I dare not see you. When you receive this I shall have left the
                     house, and, as none know whither I have gone, questions would be useless."</p>
                  <p>In an instant he was in the street, looking with eager eyes hither and thither
                     for some trace of the lost one. He looked in<pb n="226-227"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000129"/> vain, yet he went towards his office with
                     happier feelings than he had long known. He knew now where Lucy was, and a
                     thousand expedients suggested themselves, by which he could not fail to see
                     her. If he could only converse with her for a few minutes, he was assured he
                     could prevail on her to leave her present position, of which he could not bear
                     to think for a moment. His heart swelled, his brow flushed, whenever the
                     remembrance of that position flashed upon his mind, yet he never for an instant
                     regarded it as changing his relations with Lucy, or lessening his desire to
                     call her his. He recollected with pleasure two circumstances which had scarcely
                     been marked at the moment of their occurrence. The man who had opened the door
                     to him, when he saw him spring forward to meet Lucy, had exclaimed, "Oh! it was
                        <emph>Miss</emph> Lucy you meant, sir;" and the girl who handed the note had
                     said, "<emph>Miss</emph> Lucy has gone out, sir." It was evident she was not
                     regarded by the servants as one of themselves—she had not been degraded by
                     association with menials. This was true. Lucy had made such separation on her
                     part an indispensable necessity, and Mrs. Blakely had been too sensible of the
                     value of one possessing so much taste and skill in all feminine adornments, to
                     hesitate about complying with her demand. This lady was one of the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">nouveaux riches,</foreign> who occupied her life in scheming
                     to attain a position to which neither birth nor education entitled her. The
                     brightest dream connected with her present abode had been that its proximity to
                     Lady Houstoun's residence might lead to an acquaintance with one of the
                     proudest of that charmed circle in which Mrs. Blakely longed to tread. Hitherto
                     this had proved a dream indeed, but Edward Houstoun's incursion into her
                     domain, and the developments made by it, might, she thought, with a little
                     address, render it a reality. It was with this purpose that she sent a note to
                     Lady Houstoun, requesting an interview with her on a subject deeply connected
                     with the honor of her family and the happiness of her son. Immediately on
                     dispatching this note, the servants were ordered to uncover the furniture in
                     the drawing-room, while she herself hastened to assume her most becoming
                     morning-dress. Her labors were fruitless. "Lady Houstoun would be at home to
                     Mrs. Blakely till noon," was the scarcely courteous reply to her
                     carefully-worded note. It was an occasion on which she could not afford to
                     support her pride, and she availed herself of the permission to call.</p>
                  <p>The interview between Lady Houstoun and Mrs. Blakely would have been an
                     interesting study to the nice observer of character. The efforts on the part of
                     the one lady to be condescending, and on that of the other to be dignified,
                     were almost equally successful. Mrs. Blakely had seldom felt her wealth of so
                     little consequence as in the presence of her commanding yet simply attired
                     hostess, and Lady Houstoun had never been more disposed to assert the
                     privileges of her rank, than when she heard that her son had forgotten his own
                     so far as to visit on terms of equality—nay, if Mrs. Blakely was to be
                     believed, positively to address in the style of a lover—a seamstress—the
                     seamstress of Mrs. Blakely.</p>
                  <p>"This is very painful intelligence to me, Mrs. Blakely—of course, you must be
                     aware that Mr. Houstoun could only have contemplated a temporary connection
                     with this girl. I do not fear that in his most reckless moment he could have
                     thought of such a <emph>mésalliance</emph>—but this young woman must be
                     saved—she was a <emph>protégée</emph> of Sir Edward Houstoun, and for his sake
                     must not be allowed to come to harm—may I trouble you to send her to me?"</p>
                  <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7156-00000130"/>
                  <p>The request was given very much in the style of a command. Mrs. Blakely would
                     not confess that she had great doubts of her power to comply with it, but this
                     would have been sufficiently evident to any one who had marked the uncertain
                     air and softened tone with which Lady Houstoun's wishes were made known to
                     Lucy. Indignant as she was at Mrs. Blakely's impertinent interference, Lucy
                     scarcely regretted Lady Houstoun's acquaintance with her son's feelings. We do
                     not know that far below all those acknowledged impulses leading her to comply
                     with the lady's request, there did not lie some romantic hope that influences
                     were astir through which <q>
                        <l>"Pride might be quelled and love be free,"</l>
                     </q> but this she did not whisper even to her own heart.</p>
                  <p>"Better that the lady should know all—she will act both wisely and
                     tenderly—perhaps, for her son's sake, she will aid me to leave New-York." Such
                     was the only language into which she allowed even her thought silently to form
                     itself.</p>
                  <p>Arranging her simple dress with as much care as if she were about to meet her
                     lover himself, Lucy set out for her interview with Lady Houstoun. She had but a
                     short distance to traverse, but she lingered on her way, oppressed by a
                     tremulous anxiety. She was apprehensive of she knew not what or wherefore—for
                     again and again her heart acquitted her of all blame. At length she is at the
                     door—it opens, and, with a courtesy which the servants of Mrs. Blakely never
                     show to a visitor who comes without carriage or attendants, she is ushered into
                     the presence of Lady Houstoun. The lady fixes her eyes upon her as she enters,
                     bows her head slightly in acknowledgment of her courtesy, and says coldly, "You
                     are the young woman, I suppose, whom Mrs. Blakely was to send to me?"</p>
                  <p>Lucy paused for a moment, to still the throbbing of her heart, before she
                     attempted to reply. The thought flashed through her mind, "I am a woman and
                     young, and therefore she should pity me"—but she answered in a low, sweet,
                     tremulous tone—"I am the Lucy Watson, madam, to whom Sir Edward Houstoun was so
                     kind."</p>
                  <p>At that name a softer expression stole over the Lady Houstoun's face, and she
                     glanced quickly at a portrait hanging over the ample fireplace, which
                     represented a gentleman of middle age, dressed in the uniform of a colonel of
                     the American army. As she turned her eyes again on Lucy, she saw that hers were
                     fastened on the same object.</p>
                  <p>"You have seen Sir Edward?" she said in gentle tones.</p>
                  <p>"Seen him, lady!—I loved him—oh how dearly!"</p>
                  <p>"Honored him would be a more appropriate expression."</p>
                  <p>"I loved him, lady—we are permitted to love our God," said Lucy, firmly.</p>
                  <p>Lady Houstoun's brow grew stern again—"And from this you argue, doubtless, that
                     you have a right to love his son."</p>
                  <p>Lucy's pale face became crimson, and she bent her eyes to the ground without
                     speaking—the lady continued—"I scarcely think that you could yourself have
                     believed that Edward Houstoun intended to dishonor his family by a legal
                     connection with you."</p>
                  <p>The crimson deepened on Lucy's face, but it was now the flush of pride, and
                     raising her head she met Lady Houstoun's eyes fully as she replied—"I could not
                     believe that he ever designed to dishonor himself by ruining the orphan child
                     of him who died in his father's defence."</p>
                  <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7156-00000131"/>
                  <p>"And you have intended to avail yourself of his infatuation. The menial of Mrs.
                     Blakely would be a worthy daughter, truly, of a house which has counted nobles
                     among its members."</p>
                  <p>"If I have resisted Mr. Houstoun's wishes—separated myself from him, and
                     resigned all hope of even looking on his face again, it has not been from the
                     slightest reverence for the nobility of his descent, but from self-respect,
                     from a regard to the nobleness of my own spirit. I had eaten of your bread,
                     lady, and I could not do that which might grieve you—yet the bread which had
                     cost me so much became bitter to me, and I left the home you had provided to
                     seek one by my own honest labors. I have earned my bread, but not as a
                     menial—not in the companionship of the vulgar—and this Mrs. Blakely could have
                     told you."</p>
                  <p>"If your determination was, as you say, to separate yourself from Mr. Houstoun,
                     it is unfortunate that you should have taken up your residence so near us."</p>
                  <p>"I knew not until this morning that I was near you."</p>
                  <p>"If you are sincere in what you say, you will have no objection now to leave
                     New-York."</p>
                  <p>"I have no objection to go to any place in which I can support myself in
                     peace."</p>
                  <p>"As to supporting yourself, that is of no consequence. I will—"</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, Lady Houstoun, it is of the utmost consequence to me. I cannot
                     again live a dependent on your bounty."</p>
                  <p>"What can you do? Has your education been such that you can take the situation
                     of governess?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Merton was a highly educated man, and Mrs. Merton an accomplished woman—it
                     was their pleasure to teach me, and mine to learn from them."</p>
                  <p>"Accomplished! There stands a harp which has just been tuned by a master for a
                     little concert we are to have this evening. Can you play on it?"</p>
                  <p>Lucy drew the instrument to her and played an overture correctly, yet with less
                     spirit than she would have done had her fingers trembled less.</p>
                  <p>"Can you sing?"</p>
                  <p>Elevated above all apprehension by the indignant pride which this cold and
                     haughty questioning aroused, Lucy changed the music of the overture for a
                     touching air, and sang, with a rich, full voice, a single stanza of an Italian
                     song.</p>
                  <p>"Italian! Do you understand it?"</p>
                  <p>"I have read it with Mr. Merton."</p>
                  <p>"This is fortunate. I have been for weeks in search of a governess for a friend
                     residing in the country. I will order the carriage and take you there
                     instantly—or stay—return home and put up your clothes. I will send a coach for
                     you."</p>
                  <p>Again Lucy had vanished from Edward Houstoun's world, nor could his most
                     munificent bribes, nor most active cross-examination win any other information
                     from Mrs. Blakely's household, than that "Miss Lucy went away in a carriage"—a
                     carriage whose description presented a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">fac
                        simile</foreign> to every hackney-coach. Spite of all her precautions, he
                     suspected his mother; to his consciousness of her want of sympathy with his
                     pursuits, was therefore added a deep sense of injury, and his heart grew
                     sterner, his manner colder and more reserved than ever. Two years more were
                     passed in his studies, and a third in the long delays, the fruitless efforts
                     which mark the entrance on any career of profitable exertion. During all this
                     time, Lady Houstoun was studious to bring around him the loveliest daughters of
                     affluence and rank.<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7156-00000132"/> Graceful forms
                     flitted through her halls, and the music of sweet voices and the gay laughter
                     of innocent and happy hearts were heard within her rooms, but by all their
                     attractions Edward Houstoun was unmoved. Courteous and bland to all, he never
                     lingered by the side of one—no quick flush, no flashing beam told that even for
                     a passing moment his heart was again awake. Could it be that from all this
                     array of loveliness he was guarded by the memory of her who had stamped the
                     impress of herself on his whole altered being? If the gratification of the
                     man's sterner ambition could have atoned for the disappointment of the youth's
                     dream of love, the shadow of that memory would have passed from his life. Step
                     by step he had risen in the opinions of men, and at length one of the most
                     profound lawyers of the day sought his association with himself in a case of
                     the most intense interest, involving the honor of a lovely and much wronged
                     woman. His reputation out of the halls of justice had already become such that
                     many thronged the court to hear him. Gallant gentlemen and fair ladies looked
                     down on him from the galleries—but far apart from these, in a distant corner,
                     sat one whose tall form was enveloped in a cloak, and whose face was closely
                     veiled. Beneath that cloak throbbed a mother's heart, and through that veil a
                     mother's eyes sought the face she loved best on earth. He knew not she was
                     there, for she rarely now asked a question respecting his engagements, or
                     expressed any interest in his movements, yet how her ears drank in the music of
                     his voice, and her eyes flashed back the proud light that shone in his. As she
                     listened to his delineation of woman's claims to the sympathy and the defence
                     of every generous heart, as she heard his biting sarcasm on the cowardly nature
                     that, having wronged, would now crush into deeper ruin his fair client, as she
                     saw kindling eyes fixed upon him, and caught, when he paused for a moment
                     exhausted by the rush of indignant feeling, the low murmur of admiring crowds,
                     how she longed to cry aloud, "My son—my son!" He speaks again. Higher and
                     higher rises his lofty strain, bearing along with it the passions of the
                     multitude. He ceases—and, as if touched by an electric shock, hundreds spring
                     at once to their feet. The emphatic "Silence" of the venerable judge hushes the
                     shout upon their lips, but the mother has seen that movement, and, bursting
                     into tears of proud, triumphant joy, she finds her way below, and is in the
                     street before the verdict which his eloquence had won was pronounced.</p>
                  <p>Edward Houstoun had fitted up a room in his mother's house as a study, and over
                     his accustomed seat hung his father's portrait. To that room he went on his
                     return from the scene we have described. Beneath the portrait stood one who
                     seldom entered there. She turned at the opening of the door—the lip, usually so
                     firmly compressed, was quivering with emotion, and those stern eyes were full
                     of tears. She advanced to him, drew near, and resting her head upon his
                     shoulder whispered, "I, too, am a woman needing tenderness—shut not your heart
                     against me, my son, for without you I am alone in the world."</p>
                  <p>The proud spirit had bent, the sealed fountain was opened, and, as he clasped
                     his arms around her, the tears of mother and son mingled—but amidst the joy of
                     this reunion Edward Houstoun felt more deeply than he had done for long months
                     the desolation that had fallen on his life. His heart had been silent—it now
                     spoke again, and sad were its tones.</p>
                  <p>It is summer. The courts are closed, and all who can are escaping from the
                     city's heat to the cool, refreshing shades of the country. Wo to those who
                     remain! The pestilence has stretched<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7156-00000133"/>
                     her wings over them. The shadow and the silence of death has fallen on their
                     deserted streets. The yellow-fever is in New-York—introduced, it is said, by
                     ships from the West Indies. Before it appeared Edward Houstoun was far away. He
                     was travelling to recruit his exhausted powers—to Niagara, perhaps into Canada,
                     and in the then slow progress of news, he was little likely to be recalled by
                     any intelligence from the city. His mother was one of the first who had
                     sickened. And where were now the fair forms that had encircled her in
                     health—where the servants who had administered with obsequious attention to her
                     lightest wish? All had fled, for no gratified vanity—no low cupidity can give
                     courage for attendance on the bed of one in whose breath death is supposed to
                     lurk. The devotedness of love, the self-sacrifice of Christian Charity, are the
                     only impulses for such a deed. Yet over the sufferer is bending one whose form
                     in its perfect development has richly fulfilled its early promise, and whose
                     face is more beautiful in the gentle strength and thoughtfulness of womanhood
                     than it had been in all its early brightness. In her peaceful home, where the
                     reverent love of her young pupils and the confidence of their parents had made
                     her happy, Lucy had heard from one of Lady Houstoun's terrified domestics of
                     the condition in which she had been left, and few hours sufficed to bring her
                     to her side. Days and nights of the most assiduous watchfulness, cheered by no
                     companionship, followed, and then the physician, as he stood beside his patient
                     and marked her regular breathing, her placid sleep, and the moisture on her
                     brow, whispered, "You have saved her."</p>
                  <p>We will not linger to describe the emotions with which Lady Houstoun, awaking
                     from this long and tranquil slumber, exhausted, but no longer delirious, first
                     recognized her nurse. At first, no doubt, painful recollections were aroused,
                     but with the feebleness of childhood had returned much of its gentleness and
                     susceptibility, and Lucy was at once so tender and so cheerful, that very soon
                     her ministerings were received with unalloyed pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Sickness is a heavenly teacher to those who will open their hearts to her. Lady
                     Houstoun arose to a new life. She had stood so near to death that she seemed to
                     have looked upon earth in the light of eternity. In that light, rank and title
                     with all their lofty associations and splendid accompaniments, faded away,
                     while true nobleness, the nobleness which dwells in the Christian precept,
                     "Love your enemies—do good to those that despitefully use you," stood out in
                     all its beauty and excellence.</p>
                  <p>As soon as Lady Houstoun could be removed with safety, she went, by the advice
                     of her physician, to her country seat. Lucy would now have returned to her
                     pupils—she feared every day lest Edward Houstoun should appear, and a new
                     contest be necessary with his feelings and her own—but Lady Houstoun still
                     pleaded her imperfectly restored health as reason for another week's delay, and
                     Lucy could not resist her pleadings.</p>
                  <p>It was afternoon, and Lucy sat in the library, which was in the rear of the
                     house, far removed from its public entrance. Spenser's Faery Queen was in her
                     hand, but she had turned from its witching pages to gaze upon the title-page,
                     on which was written, in Edward Houstoun's hand, "June 24th, 17—." It was the
                     day, as Lucy well remembered, on which he had first revealed his love, and
                     chosen his career in life. She was aroused from her reverie by Lady Houstoun's
                     entrance. As she held the door open the bright sunlight from an opposite window
                     threw a shadow on the floor which made Lucy's heart throb painfully.<pb n="236"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000134"/> She looked eagerly forward—a manly form entered
                     and stood before her. She could not turn from the pleading eyes which were
                     fixed with such intense earnestness on hers. With a bewildered, half-conscious
                     air she rose from her chair. He came near her and extended his arms. One glance
                     at the smiling Lady Houstoun showed Lucy that her interdict was removed, and
                     the next instant she lay in speechless joy once more upon her lover's
                     bosom.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>WE were within three days of the New Year. Mr. Arlington, who was quite learned on
                  the subject, had been amusing us with an account of its various modes of
                  celebration in various countries. He was quite brilliant in a description of
                  New-York as seen under the sun of a clear, frosty New Year morning, with snow
                  enough to make the sleighing good. The gay, fantastic sleighs, dashing hither and
                  thither, and their exhilarated occupants bowing now on this side and now on that,
                  to acquaintances rushing by almost too rapidly to be distinguished, while the
                  silvery bells ring out their merry peals on the still air. Then the festive array
                  which greets the caller at every house within which he enters. Beauty adorned with
                  smiles and dress, gayly decorated tables, brightly burning fires, and every thing
                  seeming to speak the welcome not of mere form, but of hearty hospitality. There is
                  one aspect in which he presents this day to us, that is peculiarly pleasing. He
                  says, that many a slight estrangement springing from some one of those "trifles"
                  which "make the sum of human life" has been prevented, by the influence of this
                  day, from becoming a life-long enmity. Thus the New Year's day becomes a
                  Peace-maker, and has on it the blessing of Heaven. Long live the custom which has
                  made it such!</p>
               <p>"And how shall we celebrate our New Year?" asked Col. Donaldson.</p>
               <p>"Let us introduce the New-York custom," suggested one.</p>

               <p>"That would not do without some previous agreement with your neighbors," replied
                  Mr. Arlington, "as their ladies would not probably be prepared for your visits,
                  and while you were making them, the ladies of your own family would be left to
                  entertain themselves as they could."</p>
               <p>"That will never do," said Col. Donaldson; "better invite all our neighbors to
                  visit us on that day. Suppose we give them a dinner?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa!" cried Miss Donaldson in dismay. And "My dear husband!" ejaculated the
                  smiling Mrs. Donaldson, "where would you find a room to accommodate them all?"</p>
               <p>"True—true—we could not dine them in the open air at this season."</p>
               <p>"But there would be no such objection to an evening party," said one of the young
                  Donaldsons. "We have fine sleighing now, and the moon rises only a little after
                  eight on New Year evening; why not invite them for the evening."</p>
               <p>"What, another such stiff affair as Annie insisted on entertaining her friends the
                  Misses Morrisons with the last winter, when I saw one of the poor girls actually
                  clap her hands with delight at the announcement of her carriage?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! Leave it to me, and it shall not be a stiff affair at all. We will appear
                  in fancy dresses—"</p>
               <p>"My dear Philip!" remonstrated Mrs. Donaldson.</p>
               <p>"Oh! not you, my dear mother, nor my father, unless he likes it—indeed, it shall
                  be optional with all—but enough, I am sure, will like it to make an entertaining
                  variety."</p>
               <p>"But where shall we get fancy dresses, distant as we are from the city?" asked
                  Annie.</p>
               <p>"Leave yours to me, Annie, I have it ready for you," said Philip Donaldson, with
                  so significant an air, that I at once suspected this suggestion to have been the
                  result of the arrival on that very day of a box, addressed to him by a ship from
                  Constantinople, of which box he had hitherto made a great mystery.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Philip; but you cannot, I suppose, supply all the company, and I had
                  rather not be the only one in fancy costume, if you please."</p>
               <p>"If mamma will surrender to me the key of that great wardrobe, upstairs, which
                  contains the brocade dresses, shoe-buckles, knee-buckles, etc., of our
                  great-grandfathers and grandmothers, I will promise to supply dresses for our own
                  party, at least, with a little aid from the needles and scissors."</p>
               <p>"I bar scissors," cried Col. Donaldson. "Those venerable heir-looms—"</p>
               <p>"Shall not lose a shred, sir," said Philip; "the scissors shall only be used to
                  cut the threads, with which the ladies take in a reef here and there, when it is
                  necessary."</p>
               <p>"But you have only provided for our party. Are our guests not to be in
                  costume?"</p>
               <p>"That will be as they please. We will express the wish, and if they have any
                  ingenuity, they will have no difficulty in getting up some of the staple
                  characters of such a scene, flower-girls and shepherdesses, sailors, sultans, and
                  beggars."</p>
               <p>The scheme seemed feasible enough, when thus presented, and had enough of novelty
                  to please the young people. It was accordingly adopted, and the evening was passed
                  in writing invitations, which were dispatched at an early hour the next morning.
                  The three succeeding days were days of pleasurable excitement, in preparation for
                  the fête. Needles and scissors were both in active use, and the brocade dresses
                  lost, I am afraid, more<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7156-00000138"/> than one shred
                  in the process of adjusting them to the figures for which they were now designed.
                  Mrs. Dudley and Mrs. Seagrove were thus arranged as rival beauties of the court of
                  Queen Anne, Philip Donaldson, with the aid of a bag-wig, for which Mr. Arlington
                  has written at his request to a friend in what city I may not say, and with some
                  of his father's youthful finery, and the shoe and knee buckles aforesaid, will
                  make an excellent beau for these belles. Col. Donaldson, always ready for any
                  harmless mirth, says they must accept him in his father's continental uniform for
                  another. Mr. Arlington makes quite a mystery of his costume, but it is a mystery
                  already revealed, both to Col. Donaldson and Philip, as I can plainly perceive by
                  the significant glances they exchange whenever an allusion is made to it. Robert
                  Dudley is to be a page, Charles Seagrove, a beautiful boy of six years old, an
                  Oberon, and our little Eva a Titania. Mrs. Donaldson and I were permitted to
                  appear in our usual dress, and Miss Donaldson strenuously claimed the same
                  privilege, but it was not granted to her. She resisted all entreaties, even from
                  her favorite brother Arthur; but when her father gravely regretted her inability
                  to sympathize with the enjoyments of others, she was overcome. Having yielded, she
                  yielded entirely, and was willing to wear any thing her sisters wished. As she is
                  considered by them all, even in her thirty-third year, as the beauty of the
                  family, her dress has been more carefully studied by them than any other. Every
                  book of costumes within their reach was searched for it again and again, without
                  success; one was rich, but unbecoming, another pretty, but it did not suit her
                  style, and a third all they desired, but unattainable at so short a notice. As a
                  last resource, my engravings were resorted to, and there, to my own surprise, they
                  found what satisfied all their demands. It was the dress worn in her bridal days
                  by Hotspur's Kate, as seen in the last engraving. Miss Donaldson accepted it
                  thankfully, as being less <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bizarre</foreign> than any yet
                  proposed to her, requiring nothing more than a full skirt of white satin, a jacket
                  not very unlike the modern Polka, and a bridal veil. One condition she insisted
                  on, however, namely, that Arthur should be her Hotspur. To this he consented
                  without difficulty, not without an eye, I suspect, to the appearance of his tall,
                  erect, graceful form and bearing in such a dress.</p>
               <p>The last evening of the Old Year had arrived, our preparations were completed, and
                  our little party were experiencing something of that <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >ennui</foreign> which results from having nothing to do, when, in putting away
                  the materials lately in use, Annie found my engraving of Hotspur and Kate. Handing
                  it to me, she said, "I know these engravings are precious, Aunt Nancy, though what
                  can be the association with this one, I am, I acknowledge, at a loss to
                  conceive."</p>
               <p>"And yet it is a very simple one. I treasure it in memory of my friend Harry Percy
                  and his bride."</p>
               <p>"What! Hotspur?" questioned Annie, with dilating eyes.</p>
               <p>"Not quite, though he was a lineal descendant of the old Percys, and hot enough on
                  occasion, too."</p>
               <p>"You mean Col. Percy of the British army, who married Miss Sinclair, of Havre de
                  Grace, during our last war with England, or immediately after it, I never quite
                  understood which. There seemed some mystery about the marriage, and I did not like
                  to inquire too closely, but I dare say now, Aunt Nancy, you can tell us all about
                  it."</p>
               <p>"I believe I can. See, Annie, if among those packages you can find one labelled
                  'The Test of Love.'"</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7156-00000139"/>
               <p>"What! another story of a proud beauty winning her glove and losing her lover?"
                  asked Mr. Arlington.</p>
               <p>"No; my test, or rather my hero's test, was somewhat different," I replied, as I
                  received the package from Annie, and read,</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Test of Love.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A STORY OF THE LAST WAR.</head>
                  <p>WHEN Mr. Sinclair, the rector of St. John's, in Havre de Grace, took possession
                     of his pretty parsonage, and persuaded the fair and gentle Lucy Hilman to
                     preside over his unpretending <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ménage,</foreign> and to
                     share the comforts that lay within the compass of his salary of one thousand
                     dollars per annum, he felt that his largest earthly desires were fulfilled. A
                     daughter was given to him, and with a grateful heart he exclaimed—"surely Thou
                     hast made my cup to overflow."</p>
                  <p>But he too was a man "born to trouble." He too must be initiated into those
                     "sacred mysteries of sorrow," through which the high priest of his profession
                     had passed. In the succeeding ten years, three other children opened their
                     soft, loving eyes in his home, made its air musical with their glad voices and
                     ringing laughter, and just as he had learned to listen for the pattering of
                     their dimpled feet, and his heart had throbbed joyously to their call, they
                     were borne from his arms to the grave, and the echoes which they had awakened
                     in his soul were hushed for ever. Still his Lucy and their first-born were
                     spared, and as he drew them closer to his heart he could "lift his trusting
                     eyes" to Him from whom his faith taught him no real evil could come to the
                     loving spirit. The shadow of earth had fallen on his heart, but the light of
                     heaven still beamed brightly there. Years passed with Mr. Sinclair in that deep
                     quiet of the soul which is "the sober certainty of waking bliss." His labors
                     were labors of love, and he was welcomed to repose by all those charms which
                     woman's taste and woman's tenderness can bring clustering around the home of
                     him to whom her heart is devoted. But a darker trial than any he had yet known
                     awaited him.</p>
                  <p>War is in our borders, and that quiet town in which Mr. Sinclair's life has
                     passed is destined to feel its heaviest curse. Its streets are filled with
                     soldiery. The dark canopy of smoke from which now and then a lurid flame shoots
                     upward, shows that their work is destruction, and that they will do it well.
                     Terrified women flit hither and thither, mingling their shrieks in a wild and
                     fiend-like concert with the crack of musketry, the falling of houses, and the
                     loud huzzas and fierce outcries of excited men. At a distance from that quarter
                     in which the strife commenced, stands a simple village church, within whose
                     shadow many of those who had worshipped in its walls during the last half
                     century, have lain down to rest from the toils of life. No proud mausoleum
                     shuts the sunshine from those lowly graves. Drooping elms and willows bend over
                     them, and the whispering of their long pendent branches, as the summer breeze
                     sweeps them hither and thither, is the only sound that breaks the stillness of
                     that hallowed air. Near the church, on the opposite side from this home of the
                     dead, lies a garden, where roses and honey-suckles perfume the air, while its
                     bowers of lilac and laburnum, of myrtle and jessamine, almost shut from the
                     view the pretty cottage to which it belongs. All around, all within that
                     cottage is silent. Have its inmates fled?</p>
                  <p>The neighboring houses have been long deserted, and those<pb n="244-245"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000140"/> who left them would gladly have persuaded their
                     pastor to accompany them; but when they called to urge his doing so, he could
                     only point to the bed on which, already bereft of sense, and evidently fast
                     passing from life, lay one "all lovely to the last." Mrs. Sinclair's health,
                     delicate for years, had rapidly failed in the last few months, till her anxious
                     husband and child, aware that a moment's acceleration of the pulse, a moment's
                     quickening of the breath from whatever cause, might snatch her from their arms,
                     learned to modulate every tone, to guard every look and movement in her
                     presence. But they could not shut from her ears the boom of the cannon which
                     heralded the approach of the foe—they could not hush the startling cries with
                     which others met the announcement of their arrival, and the first evidences of
                     that savage fury which desolated their homes, and left a dark stain on the
                     escutcheon of Britain. Mrs. Sinclair uttered no cry when her terrors were thus
                     excited, she even strove to smile upon her loved ones, to raise their drooping
                     hearts, and in this, woman's holiest task, the springs of her life gave way—not
                     with a sudden snap, but slowly, gently—so that for hours her husband and
                     daughter stood watching the shadow of death steal over her, hoping yet to catch
                     one glance of love, one whispered farewell ere she should pass for ever from
                     them.</p>
                  <p>"Fear not, my child," said Mr. Sinclair, when their sad vigils were first
                     interrupted by those who urged their flight—"they are enemies, it is true, but
                     they are Englishmen. A peaceful clergyman, a defenceless woman, are safe in
                     their hands—they will not harm us."</p>
                  <p>"I have no fear, no thought of them, father!" said Mary Sinclair, as she turned
                     weeping to the only object of fear or hope, or thought, at that moment.</p>
                  <p>But soon others of Mr. Sinclair's parishioners come to warn him that his
                     confidence had been misplaced, that no character, no age, no sex, had proved a
                     protection from the ruthless fury of their assailants. He would now have
                     persuaded his daughter to accompany her friends to a place of safety, and when
                     persuasions proved vain he would have commanded her, but, lifting her calm eyes
                     to his, she said, "Father, have you not taught me that, in all God's universe,
                     the only safe place for us is that to which our duty calls us—and is not my
                     duty here?"</p>
                  <p>A colder heart would have argued with her, and might, perhaps, have proved to
                     her that her duty was not there—that her father could watch the dying, and that
                     it was her duty to preserve herself for him; but Mr. Sinclair folded her in his
                     arms, while his lips moved for an instant in earnest prayer, and then, turning
                     to his waiting friends, he said, "Go, go, my friends—I thank you—but God has
                     called us to this, and He will care for us."</p>
                  <p>When the work of desolation had been completed in the quarter first attacked,
                     parties of soldiers straggled off from the main body in search of further prey.
                     Fearful was it to meet these men—their faces blackened with smoke, their hands
                     stained with blood, fierce frowns upon their brows, and curses on their lips.
                     The parsonage presented little attraction in its external aspect to men whose
                     object was plunder, and they turned first to larger and more showy buildings.
                     These were soon rifled; the noise of their ribald songs, their blasphemous
                     oaths and drunken revelry penetrating often the chamber of death, yet scarcely
                     awakening an emotion in the presence of the great Destroyer. At length the
                     little gate is flung rudely open, and unsteady but heavy steps ascend from the
                     court-yard to the house. They cross<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7156-00000141"/>
                     the piazza, they enter the parlor where life's gentlest courtesies and holiest
                     affections have hitherto dwelt, the door of the room beyond is thrown open, and
                     two men stand upon its threshold, sobered for an instant by the scene before
                     them. There, pale, emaciated, the dim eyes closed, and the face wearing that
                     unearthly beauty which seems the token of an adieu too fond, too tender, too
                     sacred for human language, from the parting spirit to its loved ones, the wife
                     and mother, speechless, senseless, yet not quite lifeless, lay propped by
                     pillows. At her side knelt Mr. Sinclair; the pallor of deep, overpowering
                     emotion was on his cheek, yet in his lifted eyes there was an expression of
                     holy faith, and you might almost have fancied that a smile lay upon the lips
                     which were breathing forth the hallowed strains of prayer—"Save and deliver us,
                     we humbly beseech Thee, from the hands of our enemies, that we, being armed
                     with thy defence, may be preserved evermore from all perils to glorify Thee,
                     who art the only giver of all victory, through the merits of thy Son, Jesus
                     Christ our Lord—Amen."</p>
                  <p>Dark, sinful men as they were, fresh from brutal crime, those strains touched a
                     long silent chord in their hearts—a chord linked with the memory of a smiling
                     village in their own distant land—with a mother's love and the innocence of
                     childhood. Faint—faint, alas! were those memories, and Mr. Sinclair's "amen"
                     had scarce issued from his lips, when the eyes of the leader rested on the
                     beautiful face of Mary Sinclair, as, pressed to the side of her father, she
                     stretched her arms out over her dying mother, and turned her eyes imploringly
                     on their dreaded visitors. The ruffians sprang forward with words whose meaning
                     was happily lost to the failing sense of the terror-stricken girl. Mr. Sinclair
                     started to his feet, and with one arm still clasped around his daughter, stood
                     between her and the worse than murderers before him, prepared to defend her
                     with his life. For the first time he thirsted for blood, and looked around for
                     some weapon of destruction—but his was the abode of peace—no weapon was there.
                     Unarmed, with that loved burden—loved at this moment even to agony, resting
                     upon him—he stood opposed to two fierce men armed to the teeth. A father's
                     strength in such a cause, who shall estimate?—yet, alas! his adversaries were
                     demons, relentless in purpose, and possessed of that superhuman force which
                     passion gives. Weary of killing, or influenced by that superstition which
                     sometimes rules the soul from which religion is wholly banished, they did not
                     avail themselves of their swords. With fierce threats they unclasped his arm
                     from that senseless form, which sank instantly to the floor at his feet, and
                     drew him across the room. They would have forced him into the parlor, but his
                     resistance was desperate, and ere they could accomplish this, the sound of a
                     drum beating the recall was borne faintly to their ears. Leaving his comrade to
                     hold the wildly struggling father, the bolder ruffian turned back toward the
                     still prostrate Mary. At that moment, before she had been polluted by a touch,
                     the door was thrown violently back, and a tall, manly form strode through it.
                     The gilded epaulettes and drooping feather told his rank, before the step of
                     pride and countenance of stern command had conveyed to the mind the conviction
                     that you stood in the presence of one accustomed to be obeyed. The man who
                     grasped Mr. Sinclair loosed his hold and shrank cowering away. He went
                     unnoticed, for the eye of the officer had fallen upon him who was in the act of
                     stooping to lift Mary Sinclair from the floor. With a single spring he was at
                     his side, and catching him by the collar of his coat, he hurled him from<pb
                        n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7156-00000142"/> him with such force that he fell
                     stunned against the farther wall. Mr. Sinclair was already bending over his
                     daughter. As he raised her on his arm her head fell back, exposing her face,
                     around which her dark hair swept in dense masses. Her features were of
                     chiselled beauty, and had they been indeed of marble they could not have been
                     more bloodless in their hue, while her jetty lashes lay as still upon her cheek
                     as if the hand of death had sealed her eyes for ever. Mr. Sinclair had no such
                     fear. He knew that she had only fainted, and rejoiced that God in his mercy had
                     spared her the worst horrors of the scene; but as Captain Percy's eyes rested
                     on her, a deeper scowl settled on his brow, and in a hoarse whisper he
                     asked:—</p>
                  <p>"Have they harmed her, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"Not by a touch, thank God! not by a touch," exclaimed the father, as he
                     pressed her with passionate joy to his heart—aye, joy, even in the presence of
                     her so long the light of his life now passing for ever from earth. For a few
                     minutes the dying had been forgotten, for what was death—a death of peace—to
                     the long misery into which man's base, brutal passion would have converted the
                     life of that pure and lovely girl? Now, however, she was safe, and still
                     supporting her on his arm, Mr. Sinclair turned to his wife and tenderly
                     moistened her parched lips. What a mockery of all human cares seemed that pale,
                     peaceful brow—peaceful, while he whose lightest sorrow had thrown a shadow on
                     her life was suffering anguish inexpressible, and the child who had lain in her
                     bosom, to the lightest throb of whose heart her own had answered, lay senseless
                     from terror in his arms. It was a scene to touch the hardest heart, and Captain
                     Percy's heart was not hard. He looked around for the men whom he had
                     interrupted in their hellish designs—they were not there.</p>
                  <p>"Is this their work?" he asked of Mr. Sinclair, pointing to his scarce
                     breathing wife."</p>
                  <p>"No—no—this is the gentle hand of our Father," said Mr. Sinclair, as he bent
                     his head and touched with his lips the sunken cheek dearer to him now than it
                     had been in all its girlish roundness. The blood had begun to cast a slight
                     tinge of red into the lips of Mary Sinclair before Captain Percy had left the
                     room in search of the men whom he was unwilling to leave behind him, and when
                     he returned, the tremor of her form and the close clasp with which she clung to
                     her father, proved that her consciousness and her memory were awake. His step
                     had startled her, and as he entered he heard Mr. Sinclair say, "fear not, my
                     daughter, that is the step of your deliverer, and though he is an English
                     soldier——"</p>
                  <p>"I pray you, sir, judge not Englishmen by ruffians like these—a disgrace to the
                     name of man. Believe me, every country has within it wretches, who, at moments
                     such as this, when all social restraints are withdrawn, become demons. But I
                     must leave you, in safety, I trust, as I have sent to the ships all the
                     soldiers whom I could discover in your neighborhood."</p>
                  <p>"Farewell, sir," said Mr. Sinclair, extending his hand—"God reward you for the
                     timely aid you have this day brought to the defenceless. Look up, my child, and
                     join your thanks with mine."</p>
                  <p>Mary Sinclair raised her head from her father's bosom, and lifting her eyes for
                     an instant to the face of Captain Percy, unclosed her lips to speak, but voice
                     and words were denied her.</p>
                  <p>"God bless you, lady!" he exclaimed, as taking her hand he raised it to his
                     lips, and relinquishing it with one glance of sympathy at the dying, turned
                     away and passed from the room. He<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7156-00000143"/>
                     returned once more, but it was only to leave his pistols with Mr. Sinclair.</p>
                  <p>"They are loaded, sir, and in such a cause as you needed them in just now, even
                     a Christian minister may use them."</p>
                  <p>Captain Percy spoke rapidly, only glancing at Mary, who was already bending
                     with self-forgetful devotion above her mother's pillow, and before Mr. Sinclair
                     could answer he was gone.</p>
                  <p>All was again silent in that deserted suburb, and for long hours nothing
                     disturbed the solemn stillness of the chamber of death, save the low sob or
                     earnest prayer of parting love, though sounds of tumult had not ceased wholly
                     in the village. The invaders had been interrupted in their work of destruction
                     by an alarm from some of their own party of an approaching foe. They hurried to
                     their ships with mad impetuosity, conscious that their acts deserved only war
                     to the knife, and that they were not prepared to cope with any regular force.
                     Only those, who, like Captain Percy, had held themselves aloof from the brutal
                     barbarities which they had striven vainly to prevent, were now composed enough
                     to take any steps for the safety of others. To collect those who had straggled
                     off was the first business, and while the recall was hastily beaten, Captain
                     Percy, selecting a small party of men on whom he could depend, went to patrol
                     the more distant quarters of the town. Having seen no trace of an enemy on his
                     way to the parsonage, he had somewhat hastily concluded the alarm to be false,
                     and, therefore, did not hesitate, before returning with his pistols to Mr.
                     Sinclair, to send forward his men in charge of those whom he had found,
                     promising to join them before they reached the point of embarkation. Without a
                     thought of danger he traversed the silent and deserted streets on his return,
                     and had arrived where a single turn would bring him within view of the rallying
                     point of his companions in arms, when the sound that met his practised ears
                     told of something more than the hurrying tread and mingling voices of soldiers
                     rapidly embarking. Had his men been opposed? If so, they should not be without
                     a leader—and with that thought he sprang forward. He was too late. Already they
                     had fought their way through the band of villagers, who, maddened by the
                     desolation of their homes, had gathered together such weapons as they could,
                     and led on by one gallant and experienced soldier, whom their burning houses
                     had lighted to their aid, were seeking to cut off the retreat of some amongst
                     their invaders, and thus to revenge those whom they had been unable to protect.
                     Captain Percy's men had, as we have said, fought their way through this
                     band—not without loss. He now stood alone—one against many—with only his good
                     sword to aid, for his pistols he had given to Mr. Sinclair. To retreat
                     unobserved was impossible, for his own cry of "forward—forward, my men!"
                     uttered as he rushed to the scene of the just decided contest, had betrayed
                     him—to fight against such odds with the faintest hope of success was equally
                     impossible, and to yield was an alternative which there seemed to be no
                     intention of offering him. In an instant twenty swords flashed before his
                     eyes—twenty guns were pointed at his breast. That instant had been his last had
                     not Major Scott, the leader of whom we have spoken, sprung forward and placed
                     himself before him. Himself a brave and generous soldier, he could not tamely
                     witness such butchery, and pale with the terror for another which he had never
                     felt for himself, he exclaimed, "Yield yourself, sir, quickly—a moment's delay,
                     and I cannot protect you."</p>
                  <p>Captain Percy's sword was in the hand of his noble foe, who, linking his arm in
                     his, turned to face his own band, shouting<pb n="252-253"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000144"/> as he did so, "Back—back on your lives—he is my
                     prisoner, and who touches him makes me his enemy."</p>
                  <p>The day had passed with all its exciting incidents. The glow of sunset had
                     faded into twilight's soberer hues, and these had deepened into the darkness of
                     night. With the darkness, silence had settled upon the streets of Havre de
                     Grace. Those who had trodden, for hours, with burning hearts around the sites
                     of their desecrated homes, retired to that of some charitable and more
                     fortunate neighbor, to seek such rest as misery may hope. They went with sullen
                     as well as sad brows, and as they passed one house in the village they muttered
                     "curses not loud, but deep." This was the house in which Major Scott had found
                     a refuge for himself and the prisoner, whom all his influence had scarce been
                     able to protect. To remove him from Havre de Grace in the light of day, and
                     under the eyes of his infuriated enemies, was too hazardous a project to be
                     attempted, and by the advice of some who seemed disposed to second his efforts
                     for his safety, he had delayed his departure till night should veil the
                     obnoxious features of the British officer.</p>
                  <p>At the parsonage, death had accomplished his work, and the room in which we
                     have already seen Mr. Sinclair, bears the solemn impress of his presence.
                     Beside the bed on which the lifeless limbs have been composed with tender care,
                     the pastor kneels. His prayer is no longer "let this cup pass from me"—he is
                     struggling for power to say, "Father, not my will, but Thine be done!" In an
                     upper room lies Mary Sinclair. Tears are falling fast as summer rain-drops from
                     her closed eyes, but she utters neither sob nor moan, and by the dim light of
                     the shaded lamp she seems to the two women, who, with well meant but officious
                     kindness, have insisted on watching with her through the night, to sleep. A
                     slight noise in the street causes one of these women to start, and she whispers
                     to the other, "I am 'feard of every thing to-night—the least noise puts me all
                     of a trimble, for I'm thinking of my Jack. He's gone to guard that British
                     soger, and I shouldn't wonder if he had a skrimmage about him before
                     morning."</p>
                  <p>"And I must say, Miss Dunham, if he did, it would be nothin' more than them
                     deserves as would go for to guard them cruel British."</p>
                  <p>"But they do say, Miss Caxton, that this Capin—for Jack says he is a Capin—was
                     better than the rest—that he took the part of our people every where when he
                     found there wasn't any fair fight, and that he was drivin' his men to the ships
                     when we caught him."</p>
                  <p>"Them may believe that that will, but for my part I think that it must be a
                     poor, mean speritted American that will hold guard over one of them
                     British——"</p>
                  <p>"Not so mean speritted as you think perhaps," said Jack's mother with a flushed
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I must say, Miss Dunham, I never thought Jack would do such a thing—if I
                     had——"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Caxton stopped abruptly, but her companion would hear the whole—"Well
                     ma'am, if you had—what if you had?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, then, Miss Dunham, I shouldn't have been so well pleased to see him
                     keepin' company with my Sarah—but after this, of course, that's at an end."</p>
                  <p>"May be, Miss Caxton, you may think to-morrow mornin' that it would have been
                     just as well to wait till the night was gone before you said that—when you see
                     the British Capin hanging by the neck in his fine regimentals, and hear that
                     his guard<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7156-00000145"/> were the men that did
                     it—as I know they've sworn to do—you may think after all they an't so mean
                     speritted."</p>
                  <p>"Miss Dunham! if they'll do that, I'll unsay every word I've said, and proud
                     enough I would be to call one of 'em my son-in-law—but now do tell me all about
                     it—she's asleep you see," glancing at Mary Sinclair, "and there an't no body to
                     hear."</p>
                  <p>"Why, there an't much to tell. You see the Major wouldn't give way no how at
                     all about this here man—so, as they didn't want to fight <emph>him,</emph> they
                     agreed that some of the real true blues who an't afeard of nothin', should seem
                     to help the Major and persuade him to keep the man here till late in the night,
                     and that they would guard him—but they were to take care to have the key of his
                     room, and when the Major goes there he'll find it empty, or at best only a
                     bloody corpse there. They'll hang him if they can get him out of the window
                     without too much noise, but if there's any danger of his waking the Major with
                     his screeching, they'll stop his voice quick enough."</p>
                  <p>Any further conversation between these discreet watchers was prevented by a
                     sudden movement on the part of Mary Sinclair. Springing from her bed she was
                     hastening to the door when her steps were arrested.</p>
                  <p>"Dear me, Miss Mary! where are you going? Now do lie down again, my dear young
                     lady!—be patient—it's the Lord's will, you know." Such were the remonstrances
                     of her officious attendants, while, one on either side, they strove to lead her
                     back again, but Mary persisted.</p>
                  <p>"I must go to my father, Mrs. Dunham, pray let me go, Mrs. Caxton, I must speak
                     to my father."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, my good young lady, just put your wrapping gown round you first,
                     and put your feet in these slippers."</p>
                  <p>Mary complied silently, and then was suffered to proceed. Rapidly she flew to
                     her father's room—it was unoccupied, and a glance at his bed showed her that it
                     had not been disturbed. Mary was at no loss to conjecture where she should find
                     her father—but as she approached <emph>that</emph> room her steps grew slower,
                     lighter—she was treading on holy ground. With difficulty she nerved herself to
                     turn the latch of the door, and in an awed whisper she entreated her father to
                     come to her. Mr. Sinclair rose from his knees, but he lingered a moment to cast
                     one look on that still lovely face, to press his lips to that cold brow, and
                     then, reverently veiling it, he approached his daughter.</p>
                  <p>"Come quickly, papa!—not a moment is to be lost if you would save him from
                     death, and such a death—oh, papa! papa!—it may be even now too late."</p>
                  <p>Her tale was rapidly told, and before it was concluded Mr. Sinclair was ready
                     for action.</p>
                  <p>"But the house, Mary, what house is he in?"</p>
                  <p>This Mary could not tell, but rapidly ascending the stairs to her room, Mr.
                     Sinclair obtained from the two gossips the information he sought. Startled as
                     they were by his appearance, they reverenced the rector too much to question
                     his designs. Leaving his daughter to forget even her own heavy sorrow in the
                     imminent danger of another—of one whom, without any very satisfactory reason,
                     she as well as Mr. Sinclair had at once concluded to be her deliverer of the
                     morning—let us follow his steps.</p>
                  <p>The church clock tolled eleven as Mr. Sinclair passed, and the sound made his
                     fleet movements fleeter still. Street after street was traversed without a
                     voice or tread, save his own, breaking the stillness of the night. At length he
                     reached the point of the day's devastations. Dismantled and roofless houses,
                        from<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7156-00000146"/> which a dull glimmer showed
                     that the fire was not yet wholly extinguished, were seen rising here and there,
                     while in intervening spaces a charred and smouldering heap alone gave evidence
                     that man had had his dwelling there. A rapid glance as he passed without a
                     pause over this ground told its desolation. But see—what object meets his eye
                     and causes every nerve to thrill with apprehension? From the midst of one of
                     those blackened heaps a single post shoots up—wildly Mr. Sinclair casts his
                     eyes upward to its summit—gracious heaven! is he too late? To that post, at
                     about twenty feet from the ground, a cross piece is attached, to which a rope
                     has been secured, and from that rope a dark object hangs motionless. Sick with
                     horror he stops—he gazes—no! it is no illusion—dimly defined against the
                     star-lit sky, his eye, dilated by terror, traces the form of man, and fancy
                     supplies the traits of him who stood before him but a few hours since in all
                     the flush of manhood—every movement replete with energy, every look full of
                     proud resolve and generous feeling. With a searching glance Mr. Sinclair looks
                     around for the murderers—but they are gone—again, his strangely fascinated eye
                     turns to that object of horror. Is it the agitation of a death struggle which
                     causes it now to swing to and fro in the dusky air? The thought that life may
                     not yet be extinct gives him new strength—he runs—he flies to Major Scott's
                     lodgings, for from him alone is he secure of aid in his present purpose.</p>
                  <p>As Mr. Sinclair approached the house in which Major Scott had found
                     accommodations for himself and his prisoner, he found himself no longer in
                     darkness. More than one burning torch threw a lurid light upon the scene, while
                     the men who held them, and perhaps as many as twenty more stood clustered
                     together, near the house, against which some of them were engaged in elevating
                     vating a ladder. In what service that ladder might have been last used Mr.
                     Sinclair shuddered to think. Perfect stillness reigned in this party. Their few
                     orders were given in whispers.</p>
                  <p>Keeping cautiously in shadow and moving with stealthy steps, Mr. Sinclair
                     passed them and reached the house. Even when there, he had little hope of
                     making Major Scott hear him without alarming them, and he could not doubt that
                     they would do every thing in their power to frustrate his object. But Heaven
                     favored his merciful design—he touched the door and found it ajar. All was dark
                     as midnight within it, and he had scarcely taken a step when he stumbled
                     against a man whose voice sounded fiercely even in the low whisper in which he
                     ejaculated, "D—n you. Do you want to wake the Major? Don't you see you're at
                     his room door?"</p>
                  <p>"I see now, but it was so dark at first," whispered Mr. Sinclair in
                     reply—adding with that quickness of perception and readiness of invention which
                     danger supplies to some minds—"I have come to watch him—you are wanted."</p>
                  <p>The man obeyed the intimation, and he had no sooner turned away than Mr.
                     Sinclair laid his hand upon the latch of the door which had been indicated as
                     Major Scott's. It yielded to his touch, and with a quick but cautious movement
                     he entered the room, and closed the door behind him. Cautious as he was, the
                     soldier's light sleep was broken, and he exclaimed hurriedly, "Who's
                     there?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sinclair's communication was made in a hasty whisper, and Major Scott only
                     heard enough to know that his prisoner was in danger. Of Mr. Sinclair's worst
                     suspicions he did not even dream when starting to his feet, half dressed, as he
                     had thrown himself on the bed, he snatched his pistols from under<pb
                        n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7156-00000147"/> his pillow, and exclaiming to Mr.
                     Sinclair, "Follow me, sir," hurried to the scene of action, the room of Captain
                     Percy. Mr. Sinclair followed with rapid steps.</p>
                  <p>In one respect the conspirators had been disappointed—they had not obtained the
                     key of Captain Percy's room, for being now a prisoner on parole, he was
                     subjected to no confinement. He had, however, locked the door of his room
                     himself, to guard against the incursion of curiosity rather than of hostility;
                     but the lock was none of the strongest—a single vigorous application of Major
                     Scott's foot to the door started the screws which held it, and a second burst
                     it off and threw the entrance open before him. As Mr. Sinclair glanced forward,
                     "thank God!" burst from his lips to the no small surprise of Major Scott, who
                     saw little cause for gratitude in finding the object of his solicitude
                     retreating, sword in hand, toward the door, while several athletic men, their
                     faces dark with hate, were already pressing dangerously upon him, and others
                     were crowding in at the opened window. The impetuous rush of his friends freed
                     Captain Percy for a moment from his assailants, but they returned fiercely to
                     the charge, too furious now to postpone their revenge even to their deference
                     for Major Scott. Vain were Mr. Sinelair's entreaties to be heard, till their
                     advance was stayed by the sight of Major Scott's firearms—weapons with which
                     they had not furnished themselves, considering them useless in an enterprise to
                     whose complete success, silence was essential. Then first they listened to him
                     as he exclaimed, "This man is innocent, and if you shed his blood it will call
                     to heaven for vengeance. I saw him myself this day oppose himself to two of his
                     own countrymen a to save a defenceless woman from injury. That woman was my
                     daughter—some of you know her well—ah, Thompson! you may well hang your
                     head—would you slay the deliverer of her whose good nursing saved the life of
                     your motherless child—Wilson, it was but last week that she sat beside your
                     dying mother, and soothed and comforted her—but for this good and brave man she
                     would now have been with her in heaven."</p>
                  <p>It was only necessary to gain a hearing for such words to produce an influence
                     on the rash, but not cruel men whom Mr. Sinclair addressed, and scarcely half
                     an hour had passed since their entrance into the room, when they offered their
                     hands in pledge of amity to him whose life they had come to seek. As a proof of
                     their sincerity they advised Major Scott no longer to delay his departure from
                     the town, and some of them volunteered to accompany him as a guard to his
                     country-seat.</p>
                  <p>"You have saved my life," said Captain Percy, as he shook hands with Mr.
                     Sinclair at parting.</p>
                  <p>"And you have preserved for me all, except my duties, for which I can now
                     desire to live," answered Mr. Sinclair with emotion; then turning to Major
                     Scott, he added, "as soon as you consider it safe, you will, I hope, bring
                     Captain Percy to visit us. In the mean time, Captain Percy, remember that the
                     stranger and the prisoner are a clergyman's especial care, and suffer yourself
                     to want nothing which I can do for you. By the by," and he took Major Scott
                     aside and whispered him.</p>
                  <p>"Give yourself no concern about that, my dear sir," said Major Scott in reply,
                     "I will attend to it."</p>
                  <p>He did attend to it, and Captain Percy's drafts on his captor were promptly
                     met, till he was able to open a communication with the British commander.</p>
                  <p>In as quiet a manner as possible Major Scott and Captain Percy moved off from
                     the hotel, and were met in the suburbs<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7156-00000148"
                     /> by their volunteer guard, while another party of the men whom he had thus
                     saved from a great crime, attended Mr. Sinclair to his home. As he entered the
                     area of the smouldering ruins his eyes sought the object lately viewed with so
                     much horror. He had scarcely glanced at it when one of his companions stepped
                     up and disengaged a dark cloak from the noose already prepared for its expected
                     victim—"I knew no one would steal it from the gallows," said the man, as he
                     threw it over his shoulders. Mr. Sinclair smiled to think how easily
                     imagination had transformed that formless object into the fair proportions of a
                     man.</p>
                  <p>Nothing more was heard of Captain Percy for weeks—dreary weeks to many in Havre
                     de Grace—melancholy weeks to the inmates of the parsonage, who missed at every
                     turn the familiar step and voice which had been life's sweetest music to their
                     hearts. At length Mr. Sinclair received a note from Major Scott, announcing his
                     own approaching departure to the army on our Northern frontier, and requesting
                     permission for Captain Percy and himself to call on Mr. and Miss Sinclair.
                     Permission was given—the call was made, and those who had only met in scenes of
                     terror and dismay, amidst flushing looks and fierce words, now greeted each
                     other with gentlest courtesy among sounds and sights of peace. The call was
                     succeeded by a visit of some days, and this by one of weeks, till at last it
                     seemed to be understood that the parsonage was to be the home of Captain Percy
                     while awaiting the exchange which Major Scott had promised to do all in his
                     power to expedite. His society was at the present time peculiarly pleasing to
                     Mr. Sinclair, who was diverted from his own sad thoughts by the varied
                     intelligence of the soldier and traveller in many lands. Mary Sinclair had been
                     unable to meet her deliverer without a thrill of emotion which communicated an
                     air of timidity to her manner, whose usual characteristic was modest
                     self-possession. Captain Percy, at thirty-five, had outlived the age of sudden
                     and violent passion, but he had not outlived that of deep feeling. A soldier
                     from boyhood, he had visited almost every clime, and been familiar with the
                     beauties of almost every land, yet in this lovely and gentle girl, whom he had
                     guarded from ill, and whom he now saw in all the pure and tender associations
                     of her home, blessing and blessed, there was something which touched his heart
                     more deeply than he liked to acknowledge even to himself. Again and again when
                     he saw the soft, varying color that rose to her cheek at his sudden entrance,
                     or heard the voice in which she was addressing another, sink into a more
                     subdued tone as she spoke to him, did he take his hat and wander forth, that he
                     might still in solitude his bosom's triumphant throb, and reason with himself
                     on the folly of suffering his affections to be enthralled by one from whom, ere
                     another day passed, he might be separated by orders which would send him
                     thousands of miles away, and detain him, perhaps, for years.</p>
                  <p>"If I thought her feelings were really interested," he would say to himself at
                     other times—"but nonsense—how can I be such a coxcomb—all she can feel for me
                     is gratitude."</p>
                  <p>This last sentiment was echoed by Mary Sinclair, who, when self-convicted of
                     unusual emotion in Captain Percy's presence, ever repeated, "It is only
                     gratitude."</p>
                  <p>One evening Mr. Sinclair retired after tea to his study, leaving his daughter
                     and his guest together. He had not been gone long when a servant entered with
                     the letters and papers just brought by the semi-weekly mail, which conveyed to
                     the inhabitants of Havre de Grace the important events then daily
                        transpiring<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7156-00000149"/> piring in distant
                     parts of the country. The only letter was a somewhat bulky one for Captain
                     Percy. Mary received the papers and commenced reading them, that she might
                     leave her companion at liberty. Had she been looking at him she would have seen
                     some surprise, and even a little annoyance in his countenance as his eyes
                     rested on the seals of his dispatch. He opened it, and the annoyance deepened.
                     He read it more than once. Minutes passed in perfect silence, and Mary began to
                     wonder what correspondent could so deeply interest him. A heavy sigh made her
                     look up. His letter lay open on the table before him, but he had evidently long
                     ceased to read, for his arm rested upon it, while his eyes were fixed with an
                     expression at once intent and mournful on her. Mary thought only of him as she
                     said, "I hope you have no painful intelligence there, Captain Percy."</p>
                  <p>"I suppose I ought to consider it very joyful intelligence—I am no longer a
                     prisoner—I have been exchanged, and"—he hesitated, looked away, then added
                     rapidly—"I am ordered immediately to join my regiment in Canada."</p>
                  <p>A quick drawing of the breath, as if from sudden pain, met his ear—his heart
                     beat quickly, but he would not embarrass her by a glance. There was a slight
                     rustling of her dress, and turning he saw that she had risen, and with one hand
                     pressed upon the table for support, was advancing to the door. Falteringly,
                     one—two—three steps were taken, and completely overcome, pale and ready to
                     faint, she sank upon a sofa near her. He sprang forward, but she motioned him
                     away, and covering her face with her hands, burst into tears—tears of shame as
                     well as of sorrow. For an instant he stood irresolute—but only for an instant,
                     when bending over her, he whispered, "Dare I hope that you sympathize thize
                     with me, Mary—that the feeling which made even liberty painful to me since it
                     separates me from you, is not confined to my own bosom?"</p>
                  <p>Mary's sobs ceased—but she spoke not—moved not.</p>
                  <p>"Answer me, dear Mary—remember I have little time to woo, for my orders admit
                     of no delay in their execution—I must leave you to-morrow. Rise then above the
                     petty formalities of your sex, and if I may indeed hope ever to call you mine,
                     let me do so this night—this hour—your father will not, I think, fear to commit
                     you to my tenderness."</p>
                  <p>Mary uncovered her face, and raised her eyes for an instant to his, with an
                     expression so confiding that he thought his suit was won, and pressing her hand
                     to his lips, he said, "That glance tells me that you are my own, Mary. My life
                     shall prove my gratitude—but now I must seek your father—<emph>our</emph>
                     father—will you await us here?"</p>
                  <p>"I have something to say to you—sit down and hear me," said Mary, in a voice
                     which she strove in vain to raise above a whisper.</p>
                  <p>He placed himself beside her on the sofa, still clasping the hand he had taken,
                     and with a voice faltering and low at first, but gathering strength as she
                     proceeded, Mary resumed:—"I will not attempt—I do not wish to deny that you
                     have read my heart aright—that—that you who saved me are—are—" a lover's ear
                     alone could detect the next words—"very dear to me—but I cannot—I think I ought
                     not——"</p>
                  <p>She paused, and Captain Percy said, "You are not willing to intrust your
                     happiness to one so lately known."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no! you mistake my meaning—I can have no doubt of you—no fear for my own
                     happiness—but my father—who<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7156-00000150"/> will
                     care for him if I, his daughter, his only child, thus give myself to another at
                     the very time that he needs me most."</p>
                  <p>"I will not take you from him—at least not now, Mary—give me but the right to
                     call you mine, and I will leave you here, in your own sweet home—not again, I
                     trust, to be visited by war—till peace shall leave me at liberty to return to
                     England with my bride—my wife."</p>
                  <p>He would have clasped her to him as he named her thus, but Mary struggled
                     almost wildly to free herself, exclaiming, "Oh! plead not thus lest I forget my
                     father in myself—my duty in my love—the forgetfulness would be but short—I
                     should be unhappy even at your side, when I thought of the loneliness of heart
                     and life to which I had condemned him."</p>
                  <p>"But he should go with us—he should have our home. It will be a simple home,
                     Mary—for though I come of a lordly race, I inherit not their wealth—but it will
                     be large enough for our father."</p>
                  <p>"Kind and generous!" exclaimed Mary, as she suffered her fingers to clasp the
                     hand in which they had hitherto only rested, "would that it might be so—but
                     that were to ask of my father a sacrifice greater even than the surrender of
                     his daughter—the sacrifice of his sense of duty to the people who have chosen
                     him as their spiritual father—and to whom he considers himself bound for
                     life."</p>
                  <p>Captain Percy remained silent long after she had ceased to speak, with his eyes
                     resting on her downcast face. At length, in low, sad tones, he questioned, "And
                     must we part thus?"</p>
                  <p>Mary's lips moved, but she could not speak.</p>
                  <p>"I will not ask you to remember me, Mary," he resumed, "for if forgetfulness be
                     possible to you, it will perhaps be for your happiness to forget—yet—pardon me
                     if I am selfish—I would have some little light amid the darkness gathering
                     around my heart—may I hope that had no duty forbidden you would have been
                     mine?"</p>
                  <p>She yielded to his clasping arm, and sinking on his bosom, murmured there,
                     "Yours—yours ever and only—yours wholly if I could be yours holily."</p>
                  <p>From this interview Mary retired to her chamber, and Captain Percy sought his
                     host in his study. After communicating to Mr. Sinclair the contents of the
                     dispatch he had just received, he continued, "I must in consequence of these
                     orders leave you immediately—but before I go I have a confession to make to
                     you. You will not wonder that your lovely daughter should have won my heart;
                     but one hour since, I could have said that I had never yielded for an instant
                     to that heart's suggestions—had never consciously revealed my love, or
                     endeavored to excite in her, feelings which, in my position and the present
                     relations of our respective countries, could scarcely fail to be productive of
                     pain. I can say so no longer. The moment of parting has torn the veil from the
                     hearts of both—she loves me"—there was a joyous intonation in Captain Percy's
                     voice as he pronounced these last words. He was silent a moment while Mr.
                     Sinclair continued to look gravely down—then suddenly he resumed—"Pardon my
                     selfishness—I forget all else in the sweet thought that I am loved by one so
                     pure, so gentle, so lovely. But though I have dared without your permission to
                     acknowledge my own tenderness, and to draw from her the dear confession of her
                     regard, there my wrong has ended—she has assured me that she could never be
                     happy separated from you, and that you are wedded to your people." Mr. Sinclair
                     shaded with his hand features quivering with emotion.<pb n="266-267"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000151"/> "At present," continued Captain Percy, "these
                     feelings, which are both of them too sacred for me to contest, place a barrier
                     between us, and I have sought from her no promise for the future—if she can
                     forget me—" Captain Percy paused a moment, then added abruptly—"may a happier
                     destiny be hers than I could have commanded—but, sir, the time may come when
                     England shall no longer need all her soldiers—an orphan and an only child, I
                     have nothing to bind me to her soil—should I seek you then and find your Mary
                     with an unchanged heart, will you give her to me?—will you receive me as a
                     son?"</p>
                  <p>"Under such circumstances I would do so joyfully," Mr. Sinclair replied, "yet I
                     cannot conceal from you now that I grieve to know that my daughter must wear
                     out her youth in a hope long deferred at best, perhaps never to be
                     realized."</p>
                  <p>Both gentlemen were for a few minutes plunged in silent thought. Captain Percy
                     rose from his seat—walked several times across the room, and then stopping
                     before the table at which Mr. Sinclair was seated, resumed the
                     conversation.</p>
                  <p>"Had I designedly sought the interest with which your daughter has honored me,"
                     he said, "your words would inflict on me intolerable self-reproach, but I
                     cannot blame myself for not being silent when silence would have been a
                     reproach to her delicacy and a libel on my own affection. Now, however, sir, I
                     yield myself wholly to your cooler judgment and better knowledge of her nature,
                     and I will do whatever may in your opinion conduce to her happiness, without
                     respect to my own feelings. If you think that she can forget the past, and you
                     desire that she should"—his voice lost its firmness and he grasped with
                     violence the chair on which he leaned—"I will do nothing to recall it to her
                     memory. It is the only <foreign xml:lang="FRA">amende</foreign> I can make for
                     the shadow I have thrown upon her life—dark indeed will such a resolve leave my
                     own."</p>
                  <p>"It would cast no ray of light on hers. Be assured her love is not a thing to
                     be forgotten—it is a part of her life."</p>
                  <p>"And it shall be repaid with all of mine which my duties as a soldier and
                     subject leave at my disposal. Do not think me altogether selfish when I say
                     that your words have left no place in my heart for any thing but happiness—I
                     have but one thing more to ask of you—it is a great favor—inexpressibly
                     great—but——"</p>
                  <p>"Nay—nay," Mr. Sinclair exclaimed, gathering his meaning more from his looks
                     and manner than from the words which fell slowly from his lips—"ask me not so
                     soon to put the irrevocable seal upon a bond which may be one of misery."</p>
                  <p>"If your words be true—if her love be a part of her life, the irrevocable seal
                     has been already affixed by Heaven, and I only ask you to give your sanction to
                     it, that by uniting her duty and her love, you may save her gentle spirit all
                     contest with itself, and give her the fairest hope of future joy."</p>
                  <p>It was now Mr. Sinclair's turn to rise and pace the floor in agitated
                     silence—"I know not how to decide so suddenly on so momentous a question," he
                     at length exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>"Suppose you leave its decision to her whom it most concerns. It is for her
                     happiness we are most anxious—so entirely is that my object that I would not
                     influence her determination even by a look. I will not even ask to be present
                     when you place my proposal before her; but I must repeat, sir, if you design to
                     do it, there is no time to be lost, for I must be on my way to Canada
                     to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>"So be it then—she shall choose for herself, and Heaven direct her choice!"</p>
                  <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7156-00000152"/>
                  <p>"Amen!" responded Captain Percy as Mr. Sinclair turned from the door. He heard
                     him ascend the stairs, and ask and receive admission to his daughter's room.
                     Then he counted the seconds as they grew into minutes—the minutes as they
                     extended to a quarter of an hour—a half-hour—and rolled slowly on toward the
                     hour which lacked but little to its completion, when his straining ear caught
                     the sound of an opening door, and then Mr. Sinclair's sedate step was heard
                     slowly descending the stairs and approaching the study. Captain Percy met him
                     at the door and looked the inquiry which he could not speak. Mr. Sinclair
                     replied to the look, "She is yours!"</p>
                  <p>"May I not see her and receive such a confirmation of my hopes from her own
                     lips?"</p>
                  <p>"Not to-night—I have persuaded her to retire at once—she needs repose, and we
                     must be early astir. Your marriage must for many reasons be kept secret at
                     present, and as I could not, I fear, find witnesses here on whose silence I
                     could rely, we will accompany you in the morning to Major Scott's, and there,
                     in the presence of his wife and sister, your vows shall receive the sanction of
                     the church. You must have some preparation to make, and I will bid you good
                     night, for there are certain legal preliminaries necessary to the validity of a
                     marriage here, to which I must attend this evening—unusual as the hour is."</p>
                  <p>There was a strange mingling of emotion in the hearts of the lovers as they
                     stood side by side within that room in the gray dawn of the next morning. In a
                     few hours they were to part, they knew not for what distance of space or
                     duration of time. It might be that they should never after this morning look
                     upon each other's faces in life; yet, ere they parted, there was to be a bond
                     upon their souls which should make <emph>them</emph> ever present to each
                     other, should give them the same interests, should, as it were, mould their
                     beings into one. Sacred bond of God's own forming, which thus offers the
                     support of a spiritual and indissoluble union amid the separations and changes
                     of this ever-varying life! No such strength and peace are to be found in the
                     frail and casual ties for which man in his folly would exchange this bond of
                     Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Few words were spoken during the hurried breakfast at the parsonage or the
                     drive to Major Scott's, for deep emotion is ever silent. Yet not for them were
                     the coy reserves often evinced by hearts on the verge of a life-union—the
                     faltering timidity which hesitates to lift the veil from feelings in whose
                     light existence is thenceforth to pass. They could not forget that they were to
                     part, and even Mary hesitated not to let her lover read in her eyes' shadowy
                     depths the tenderness which might soothe the parting pang, and whose memory
                     might brighten the hours of separation.</p>
                  <p>Why should we linger on a scene which each heart can depict for itself? With
                     solemn tenderness the father pronounced the words which transferred to another
                     the right to his own earthly sanctuary—the heart of his daughter—and committed
                     to another's keeping—his last and brightest earthly treasure. That treasure was
                     soon, however, returned, for a time, to his care. The vows of the marriage rite
                     had scarcely been uttered, when with one long clasp—one whispered word—one
                     lingering look—the disciplined soldier turned from his newly found joy to his
                     duties. Never had Mary seemed more lovely in his eyes or her father's than in
                     that moment, when with quivering lips, eyes "heavy with unshed tears," and
                     cheeks white with anguish, she yet smiled upon him to the last. Nor did her
                     heroic self-control<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7156-00000153"/> cease when he
                     was gone. Her father was still there, and for him she endured and was silent.
                     Only by her languid movements and fading color did he learn the bitterness of
                     her soul through the weary months of her sorrow. Weary months were they
                     indeed!</p>
                  <p>One letter she received from Captain Percy, written before he had passed beyond
                     the limits of the United States. It breathed the very soul of tenderness. "My
                     wife!" he wrote, "what joy is summed in that little word—what faith in the
                     present—what promise for the future! I find myself often repeating it again and
                     again with a lingering cadence, while your gentle eyes seem smiling at my
                     folly." Long, long did Mary wear this letter next her heart, and still no other
                     came to take its place.</p>
                  <p>They had parted in 1813, just as the falling leaves came to herald the approach
                     of winter. That winter passed with Mary in vain longing and vainer hopes.
                     Spring again clothed her home with beauty, but there came no spring to her
                     heart. Summer brought joy and gladness to the earth, but not to her, and
                     another autumn closed over her in anxious suspense. There were moments when she
                     could almost have prayed to have that dread silence broken even by a voice from
                     the tomb—other times in which she threw herself on her knees in thankfulness
                     that she could yet hope. From Major Scott she had heard that Captain Percy's
                     regiment had been sent to the South, but of him individually even Major Scott
                     knew nothing. At length came the eighth of January, that day of vain triumph on
                     which thousands fell in the contest for rights already lost or won—the treaty
                     of peace having been signed at Ghent on the twenty-fourth of the preceding
                     month. Forgetful of this useless hecatomb at war's relentless shrine, America
                     echoed the gratulations of the victors which fell with scathing power on the
                     heart of the trembling Mary. How could she hope that he, the fearless soldier,
                     had escaped this scene of slaughter! If he had, surely he would now find some
                     way to inform her of his safety, but weeks passed on, and passed still in
                     silence.</p>
                  <p>During this long period of suspense, no doubt of the tenderness and truth of
                     him she loved had ever sullied Mary's faith. Mr. Sinclair was not always thus
                     confiding, and once, on seeing the deadly pallor that overspread her face on
                     hearing the announcement of "no letters"—he uttered words of keen reproach on
                     him who could so wrong her gentle heart.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, father!" Mary exclaimed, "speak not thus—be assured it is not his
                     fault—remember that no license could tempt him to wrong the defenceless—think
                     how honorable he was in suppressing his own feelings lest their avowal should
                     bring sorrow on us—and when my self-betrayal unsealed his lips, how delicate to
                     me, how generous to you was his conduct—and who but he could have been so rigid
                     in his observance of a soldier's duty, yet so inexpressibly tender as a man! I
                     loved him because I saw him thus true and noble—and having seen him thus how
                     can I doubt him? He may be no longer on earth, but wherever he is, he is my
                     true and noble husband, and you will not again distress me, dear father, by
                     speaking as if you doubted it."</p>
                  <p>"Never," said Mr. Sinclair emphatically, and he never did, though he saw her
                     form grow thinner, and her cheek paler every day, and before the winter was
                     gone heard that deep, hollow cough from her, which has so often sounded the
                     knell of hope to the anxious heart. With the coming on of summer this cough
                     passed away, but Mary was oppressed by great feebleness and languor—scarcely
                     less fatal symptoms. Still she omitted none of<pb n="272-273"
                        xml:id="VAC7156-00000154"/> those cares essential to her father's
                     comfort—while to the poor, the sick, the sorrowing, she was more than ever an
                     angel of mercy. With feeble steps and slow she still walked her accustomed
                     round of charity, and thus living for duty she lived for God, and had His peace
                     shed abroad in her heart, even while sorrow was wearing away the springs of her
                     life. She loved to sit alone and send her thoughts forward to the future—not of
                     this life, but of that higher life in which there shall be no shadow on the
                     brightness of our joy—where love shall be without fear—no war shall desolate—no
                     opposing duty shall separate—no death shall place its stony barrier between
                     loving hearts. With a mind thus occupied, she wandered one day, in the latter
                     part of August, through the garden of the parsonage and the yard immediately
                     surrounding the church into the little inclosure beyond, within which was the
                     green and flowery knoll that marked her mother's last resting-place. As she
                     turned again toward her home the sound of a carriage driven rapidly by caused
                     her to look toward the road which lay about one hundred yards distant. The
                     carriage rushed by, and she caught but a glimpse of a gentleman leaning from
                     its window. In another moment a grove of trees had hidden both the carriage and
                     its occupant from her sight—yet that glimpse had sent a thrill through her
                     frame—a mist passed over her eyes, and with eager, trembling steps, she
                     proceeded on her way. As she reached the garden, she thought she saw her father
                     approaching it from the house, but her path led through a summer-house, and
                     when she had passed through it he was no longer visible. Every thing in the
                     house wore its usual air of quietness on her entrance, and with a feeling of
                     disappointment, for which she could not rationally account, she turned her
                     steps toward her father's study. As she drew near the door she heard his
                     voice—the words "I dread to tell her," met her ear and made her heart stand
                     still. One step more and she was at the door—she looked eagerly forward, and
                     with a glad cry sprang into the extended arms of her husband.</p>
                  <p>It was long before any of the party were sufficiently composed for
                     conversation. When that time came, Captain or rather Colonel Percy heard with
                     surprise that no letters had been received from him since his joining the army
                     in Canada. He had written often, but had been obliged to send his letters to
                     some distant post-town by his own servant. As he had declined accompanying
                     Colonel Percy to America, there was reason to suppose that he had suspected the
                     character of the correspondence, perhaps had acquainted himself fully with the
                     contents of the letters, and had taken effectual means to prevent their
                     reaching their destination, with the hope of thus completely removing from
                     Colonel Percy's mind every inducement to return to this country. Having
                     received a disabling though not dangerous wound at the battle of New Orleans,
                     Colonel then Major Percy was sent home with dispatches, and was immediately
                     ordered to join the army under Lord Wellington, then rapidly hastening to repel
                     the attempt of the prisoner of Elba to re-establish himself on the throne of
                     France. From this period till the battle of Waterloo all private concerns were
                     merged in the interest and the hurry of great public events. In that battle
                     Major Percy was again slightly wounded. His distinguished bravery was rewarded
                     by his being made again the bearer of dispatches to England. As it was evident
                     to all that the struggle which had called the whole force of Britain into the
                     field was now at an end, he had no hesitation in asking and no difficulty<pb
                        n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7156-00000155"/> in obtaining leave of absence from
                     the commander-in-chief, and had lost no time in embarking for America.</p>
                  <p>"As a consequence of peace," said Colonel Percy in conclusion, "a large part of
                     our force will be disbanded and many officers put on half-pay. A friend who is
                     very influential at head-quarters has undertaken to secure me a place on the
                     list of these last—henceforth, dear Mary, your home is mine," said Colonel
                     Percy in conclusion.</p>
                  <p>"And did you never doubt me during all this long silence?" he asked of his
                     happy wife a few days after his return.</p>
                  <p>"Never," said Mary firmly, and then added in a more playful manner—"if I should
                     step into the confessor's chair, can you answer as boldly?"</p>
                  <p>"I can, Mary—though I never received a line from you, it never occurred to me
                     to fear any change in your affection. Our marriage had placed on it the seal of
                     duty, and your conduct in relation to your father had shown me that this seal
                     you could not easily break."</p>
                  <p>"Then you did not love me less for not yielding every other consideration to
                     the gratification of your wishes?" said Mary, endeavoring to speak lightly, but
                     betraying deeper feeling by the slight tremor in her voice, and the quick blush
                     mantling in her cheek.</p>
                  <p>"Love you less!" exclaimed Colonel Percy warmly—"my love had been little worthy
                     your acceptance, dearest, had it been lessened by seeing that your principles
                     were paramount even to your affections. Happy would it be for all your sex,
                     Mary, did they recognize as the only test of a true and noble love, that it
                     increases with the increase of esteem, and finds more pleasure in the
                     excellence of its object than in its own selfish triumphs."</p>
                  <p>Ere the winter of 1815 had set in, Mary's rounded form and blooming cheek
                     relieved all Mr. Sinclair's apprehension of her consumptive tendencies, and
                     proved that her love was indeed, as he had said, "a part of her life."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>THE New-Year's day—the day after which the year is no longer new—is come and gone,
                  and while sitting here to record its events before I sleep, I look back at it with
                  pleasure, chastened by such thoughts as the young seldom have. I believe of all
                  such eras the aged may say as the poet says of his birthday: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-2">"what a different sound</l>
                        <l>That word had in my younger years,</l>
                        <l>And every time the chain comes round,</l>
                        <l>Less and less bright the link appears."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To all, these eras mark their progress on the journey of life; but to the young
                  they are bright with the promise of a happier future; the aged, they direct to the
                  grave of the buried past, and they read on them the inscription so often found on
                  the Roman monumental stones, "Siste Viator." Travellers are we from time to
                  eternity, and it is well that we should meet with these imperative calls to stand
                  and consider. Cheered by the Christian's hope, we can stand; we can look steadily
                  on the past, count the lengthening line of these memorials of our dead years, and
                  feel that but few more probably lie between us and the river of death, yet, strong
                  in the might of Death's great Conqueror, "bate no jot of heart or hope."</p>

               <p>These are grave though not sad thoughts; too grave to mingle readily with the
                  record of mirthful scenes, however innocent have been the mirth. I must,
                  therefore, lay aside my pen, and reserve the description of our New-Year for
                  to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Our New-Year opened with a cold and cloudless morning, and our party met at
                  breakfast with faces as bright as the sun. Gifts were exchanged between the
                  parents and children, the brothers and sisters—gifts, trifling in themselves, but
                  dear from their association with the cherished giver. It was a pretty sight to see
                  the venerable parents receiving from their children testimonies of that
                  affectionate consideration which the care and tenderness of years had so well
                  deserved. Tears were on Mrs. Donaldson's cheeks, and even the Colonel's eyes
                  glistened as they clasped one after another of their children to their hearts, and
                  invoked on them the blessing of Heaven. From this scene Mr. Arlington and I had
                  stood aloof, silent, but interested spectators. As the excitement of the principal
                  actors subsided, we approached and tendered our hearty congratulations, and
                  received equally hearty demonstrations of friendship. Neither had Aunt Nancy been
                  altogether forgotten in the mementos of affection provided for the day, and I
                  thought Mr. Arlington looked a little envious as Annie, with a kiss, threw around
                  my neck a chain woven of her own hair, and suspended to it the eye-glass which I
                  always wore. I do not know but his envy may have been somewhat allayed by a very
                  handsomely decorated copy of an English work on sporting, with which Col.
                  Donaldson presented him. He had scarcely found time, however, to admire it, when
                  all attention was attracted to Philip Donaldson, who entered with a servant
                  bearing the mysterious box to which I have before alluded.</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7156-00000159"/>
               <p>"There is my New-Year present to you, Annie," he said, as he began to open it. All
                  drew near and looked on with interest, yet few felt much surprise when, the cover
                  being removed, a Greek dress was disclosed. From the rich head-dress of silvered
                  muslin to the embroidered slipper, all was complete. Annie looked on with a smile
                  as he displayed piece after piece—yet her smile wore some appearance of
                  constraint; and when Philip, drawing her to him, kissed her cheek and said, "Not a
                  word for me, Annie!" with her thanks were mingled some hesitating expressions of
                  apprehension that this dress would be very conspicuous, concluding with the timid
                  question, "Do you really wish me to wear it this evening, Philip?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Annie. It was in order to show you in this dress that I proposed fancy
                  dresses for this evening; you will not disappoint me?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not—at least not willingly—I will wear it. If I wear it ungracefully
                  you will forgive me?"</p>
               <p>"I am not afraid of that," said Philip, as he glanced at her glowing face with a
                  brother's gratified pride.</p>
               <p>Miss Donaldson advised that Annie should try on the dress at once, as she
                  prudently suggested it might require some alteration.</p>
               <p>"Come with me, Aunt Nancy," said Annie, as she left the room to comply with this
                  advice.</p>
               <p>"Come back here and let us see you, Annie, when you have put it on," said Col.
                  Donaldson.</p>
               <p>Annie would have passed from the room without an answer, evading the compliance
                  which she could not refuse, but the Colonel called her back and did not dismiss
                  her till assured that the request, which he knew would be regarded as a command,
                  had been heard.</p>
               <p>The dress needed no alteration. We afterward found that Philip had sent his friend
                  a measure procured from Annie's maid, and the fit was perfect. I am not quite sure
                  that Annie, as she saw the beautiful figure reflected in her glass, regretted the
                  command which compelled her to show herself to the party awaiting her in the
                  library, to which we had withdrawn from the breakfasting room, that we might not
                  interfere with the household operations, of which the latter was, at this hour,
                  the scene. Yet it was with a little coy delay and blushing timidity that she, at
                  length, suffered me to lead her there.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful,"—"I never saw her look so well,"—"I knew it would become her," were
                  the exclamations that greeted her, on her entrance, deepening the flush upon her
                  cheek, and calling up a brighter smile to her lips. Mr. Arlington alone was
                  silent, but his soul was in his eyes, and they spoke an admiration compared to
                  which the words of others were tame.</p>
               <p>"My dear Annie," said her mother, as she gazed delightedly upon her, "how I wish I
                  had a likeness of you in that dress—you do look so remarkably well in it."</p>
               <p>Mr. Arlington stepped forward. "Would you permit me—" to Mrs. Donaldson—"Would you
                  do me the favor—" to Annie—"Might I be allowed—" with a glance at the Colonel, "to
                  gratify Mrs. Donaldson's wish. It should be my New-Year offering. I would ask only
                  an hour of your time—" deprecatingly to Annie. "That would give me an outline
                  which I could fill up without troubling you."</p>
               <p>Mr. Arlington was so earnest, and Mrs. Donaldson so gratefully pleased, that if
                  Annie had any objections, they were completely<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC7156-00000160"/> pletely overborne. Mr. Arlington produced his
                  sketching materials and disposed his subject and his light, and then intimated so
                  plainly that the consciousness of the observation of others would be fatal to his
                  success, that we withdrew, leaving only Philip with a book in a distant corner "to
                  play propriety," as he whispered to me on passing, with a mischievous glance at
                  the blushing Annie.</p>
               <p>And now the reader doubtless thinks, that in the engraving immediately preceding
                  this chapter, he has a copy of the sketch made on this New-Year morning. In this,
                  however, he deceives himself, for the work of this morning amounted to the merest
                  and most unfinished outline, which would have stood for Zuleika as well as for
                  Annie Donaldson. Yet instead of one hour, Annie generously allowed Mr. Arlington
                  nearly three. How he was occupied during all this time, I cannot tell, though that
                  he did not spend all of it in drawing I had ocular demonstration.</p>
               <p>Nearly three hours, as I have said, had passed since we had left the library,
                  when, looking from my window, I saw Philip returning to the house on horseback.
                  Having left in the library a book in which I was much interested, I had been
                  waiting somewhat impatiently for Annie's appearance, to satisfy me that I might
                  without intrusion return there for it. I now concluded, somewhat too hastily, as
                  it afterwards proved, from seeing Philip abroad, that the sitting was at an end,
                  and accordingly went for my book. I entered noiselessly, I suppose—I am usually
                  quiet in my movements—by a door directly opposite to the seat which Mr. Arlington
                  had arranged for himself, and behind the sofa on which, at his desire, Annie had
                  been seated when I left her. There still was Mr. Arlington's seat, and before it a
                  table with the drawing materials and unfinished sketch, but Mr. Arlington was on
                  the sofa beside Annie. He was speaking, but in tones so low, that even had I
                  wished it, I could not have heard him, but the few seconds for which surprise kept
                  me chained to the spot, were sufficient to suggest the subject of those murmured
                  words. The reader will probably conjecture that subject without aid from me, when
                  I tell him what I saw. Of Annie, as she sat with her back to me, I could only see
                  the drooping head and one crimson ear and cheek; Mr. Arlington's face was turned
                  to her, and was glowing with joy, and as it seemed to me with triumph. Before I
                  had turned away, he raised her hand to his lips. I saw that it rested
                  unresistingly in his clasp; and gliding through the door by which I stood, I
                  closed it softly and left them unconscious of my presence.</p>
               <p>The invitations had been given for the early hour of half-past seven, and at
                  seven, by previous arrangement, our own party collected in the library dressed for
                  the evening. There stood Col. Donaldson in the uniform of a continental major,
                  gallantly attending a lady whose fine dark eyes and sweet smile revealed Mrs.
                  Seagrove, notwithstanding the crimped and powdered hair, patched face, hoop,
                  furbelows, and farthingale, which would have carried us back to the days of Queen
                  Anne. Mrs. Dudley, in the same costume, was attended by Philip Donaldson, who
                  looked a perfect gentleman of the Sir Charles Grandison style in his full dress,
                  with bag-wig and sword. Arthur Donaldson, in the graceful and becoming costume of
                  the gallant Hotspur, was seated with his Kate by his side, and if Kate Percy
                  looked but half as lovely in her bridal array as did her present representative,
                  she was well worthy a hero's homage. But in the background, evidently shrinking
                  from observation, stood a<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7156-00000161"/> figure more
                  interesting to me than all these—it was our "sweet Annie" as Zuleika—our Bride,
                     <emph>not</emph> of Abydos—leaning on the arm of a Selim habited in a costume
                  as correct and as magnificent as her own, yet who could scarcely be said to
                     <emph>look</emph> the character well—the open brow of Mr. Arlington, where
                  lofty and serene thought seemed to have fixed its throne, and his eyes bright with
                  present enjoyment and future hope, bearing little resemblance to our imaginations
                  of the wronged and desperate Selim, whose very joy seemed but a lightning flash,
                  lending intenser darkness to the night of his despair. I was the last to enter the
                  room, and as I approached Mr. Arlington, he presented me with a very beautiful
                  bouquet. I found afterwards that he had made the same graceful offering to each of
                  the ladies at the Manor, having received them from the city, to which he had sent
                  for his Greek dress and Philip's wig. Put up in the ingenious cases now used for
                  this purpose, they had come looking as freshly as if that moment plucked. The
                  bouquet appropriated to Annie differed from all the others. It was composed of
                  white camelias, moss-rose buds and violets. As I was admiring it, Annie pointed to
                  one of the rose-buds as being particularly perfect in its formation and beautiful
                  in its delicate shading. It was beautiful, but my attention was more attracted by
                  the sparkling of a diamond ring I had never before seen upon her finger. The
                  diamond was unusually large, the antique setting tasteful. With an inconsideration
                  of which I flatter myself I am not often guilty, I exclaimed in surprised
                  admiration, "Why, Annie, where did you get that beautiful ring?"</p>
               <p>The sudden withdrawing of the little hand, the quick flushing of cheek, neck,
                  brow, told the tale at once—a tale corroborated by the smiling glance which met
                  mine as it was turned for a moment on Mr. Arlington. Her confusion was beautiful,
                  but he was too generous to enjoy it, and strove to bring me back to the
                  flowers.</p>
               <p>"Have you ever seen some beautiful verses, translated from the German, by Edward
                  Everett I believe, entitled 'The Flower Angels?'" he asked.</p>
               <p>"I never did—can you repeat them?"</p>
               <p>He answered by immediately reciting the verses which I here give to the
                  reader.</p>

                  <p>The visitors soon began to arrive. There were among them some amusing
                     characters, so well supported as to give rise during the evening to many
                     entertaining scenes, but to me this was the group and this the incident of the
                     evening. Not a group or an incident for prurient curiosity or frivolous jest,
                     but for an earnest and reverent recognition of that beautiful law imposed on
                     Nature by her Great Author, by which the feeble delight in receiving, and the
                     strong in giving support—that law by which a pure and self-abnegating affection
                     is made the source of life in all its commingling relations—of its duties and
                     its sympathies—its joys and its sorrows—of its severest probation and its
                     loftiest development.</p>
                  <p>It was in the solemnity of spirit, engendered by thoughts like these that I
                     stood at the window of my room, looking forth upon the still and moonlit night,
                     long after our friends had left us. My door opened softly and Annie glided in,
                     and ere I was aware of her presence, was standing beside me with her head
                     resting on my shoulder. A tear was on the cheek to which I pressed my lips. A
                     few whispered words told me whence the ring came—but not for the public are the
                     pure, guileless confidences of that hour.</p>
                  <p>Our holiday festivities were over, and the next day the Christmas Guests
                     departed. They had stepped aside awhile from the dusty thoroughfares on which
                     they were accustomed to pursue their several avocations, for the interchange of
                     friendly sympathy with each other, and the offering of grateful hearts to<pb
