STEARNS, In the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York. ROCKWELL &amp; CHURCHLL, Printers and Stereotypers, 122 Washington St., Boston.   THE INVESTIGATIONS OF LUNARIUS. OF late years there has been much specu- lation among philosophers relative to the plurality of worlds, and whether other planets and orbs are, like our own, teeming with sentient, rational, intelligent beings. And if so, what is this physical structure? Have they bodies like ours? What is their char- acter? Have death and woe ever entered their abodes? Or have they "kept their first estate"? And are they, like our first parents in Paradise, in primeval innocence, holding constant, delightful converse with 3  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7131-00000004"/> 'TH INVESTIGATIONS God, - scanning his works, and glorying in his perfections? If they are fallen beings, has the same stupendous display of mercy, the same magnificent scheme for their res- toration to the divine favor, been published among them? And shall we eventually, if saved, mingle with the virtuous and good of those distant and distinct worlds, after all the machinery for our material existence, having become useless, shall be demol- ished, together with the great globe, itself on which we dwell? These and questions of similar import have often agitated the minds of men. But whatever may be the truth in regard to these imaginings, and leaving philosophers and speculatists to pursue their inquiries, I beg leave here to relate an occurrence that has, for some days past, occupied more or   XI   --  OF LUNARIUS.  less of my thoughts, and in which I confess I have become a good deal interested. Hav- ing perhaps presumptuously consented to deliver a temperance lecture to the good people of this town, and claiming to be, in one respect at least not unlike the great Jew- ish lawgiver, slow of speech, I turned aside into a retired grove, to try to study out some "form of sound words" wherewith to deliver myself of the message. Night had overshadowed the earth, and busy mortals had retired to rest. While deeply musing, and not a little perplexed as to what the matter of my speech should be, my attention was suddenly arrested by a singular phenomenon. Casting my eyes towards the full moon, - which was then just about midway toward the zenith, - I discovered, poised on easy pinions, about  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7131-00000005"/> 'THE INVESTIGATIONS midway in the heavens, in reality or imagi- nation, which I need not tell, - it matters not, - I saw, or imagined I saw, a being of unearthly make; lofty, erect, majestic, benignant; in all his movements graceful and heavenly. It was Lunarius. He had come from that bright orb which was then reflecting, with such mildness, its soft lustre upon the earth. The philosophers of his native planet it seems, like those of our own, had long in- quired and tried, but tried in vain, to solve the problem, whether the earth, which to them was the most proximate, and, next to the sun, by far the most glorious object in the heavens, was inhabited; and if so, what were the character, condition, employments, and prospects of the beings that dwelt upon it? Lunarius, having obtained permission   OF LUNARIUS.      7 from the Lord of his sphere, had, in behalf of his species, undertaken this first voyage of observation and discovery. Arriving in the vicinity of our earth, and having stationed himself in the position above described, he had, unobserved hitherto, spent much time in surveying our world, and looking into the affairs of men. It did not take him long to discover that he had come to a rebellious province of God's dominions. While some things seemed to indicate that this revolted world was still, to some ex- tent, under the government of the great Creator, many most revolting scenes passed under his observation. He discovered, with the deepest grief, that the races of man had given themselves up to violence and the indulgence of passions almost unrestrained, and that the greatest enemy of mankind is  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7131-00000006"/> 8     THE INVESTIGATIONS man. But amid these scenes of universal wretchedness and- woe, there was one de- partment of human pursuit and suffering that particularly attracted his attention, and deeply affected him. "What it could image, much he searched to know, And still he stood and gazed and wondered long." And the longer he gazed and stood, the more he wondered, till all his thoughts and passions seemed engrossed by what he saw, and led him, perhaps unconsciously, to break the silence. "Stranger! inhabitant of the earth!" said he; " what mean those dark, unsightly dens which I see scattered so frequently in the dells and corners of the earth, that send forth vapor and fire and smoke and stench? I see the busy multitude wending their way   OF LUNARIUS.      9 thither from every point, laden with the fruits of the earth, which were evidently designed by the beneficent Creator for the sustenance of man, and casting their bur- dens unhesitatingly into the fiery crater. Again I have looked to see if anything was borne away from these receptacles, from which I might infer that the fruits of the earth had been worked over, and better adapted to the wants of man. But, though long I've looked with painful eye, I've looked in vain. But I see issuing from every one of them, through dark, leaden pipes, certain fiery streams. These flow out into numerous reservoirs, and then, in innumerable smaller streams, they are con- veyed to your cities and towns and villages, and all over your vast prairies, over your hills and through your valleys, to almost  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7131-00000007"/> 10    THE INVESTIGATIONS every habitation of man. I see the multi- tude everywhere, eager for its approach, and opening their houses, and their mouths even, to receive the fiery fluid. I see the aged and the young, the decrepit and the healthy, the male and the female, the high and the low, the rich and the poor, plung- ing, with desperate strides, into the stream, and goging themselves therefrom. I see parents laving their children with it, and, ever and anon, pouring it down their necks; and the delicate female even, receiwing it to her lips. "But," continued he, " the effects which I perceive inevitably to follow upon coming in contact with these streams, perplex and trouble me much." Here Lunarius went into an enumeration, at length, of the dreadful effects which,   OF LUNARIUS.      " from his aerial seat he had himself witnessed, with a particularity, and in a strain of eloquence that would have done credit to a modern temperance agent, or a Washing- tonian who had lived all his life in the midst of these fiery streams, and been himself deeply affected thereby. But time would fail me to follow him in this painful enu- meration. Suffice it to say, that, so far as his observation had gone, the effects were only evil. His heart had not yet been re- lieved by the discovery of any good -the minutest - intermingled with the evil. Des- olation: and woe seemed to characterize the progress of these streams wherever they went. "O man! inhabitant of the earth, and better skilled than a stranger from a distant planet in the economy of man,- will you relieve this aching heart," he  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7131-00000008"/> 12    THE INVESTIGATIONS kindly asked, "by informing me now, what good accrues to mankind from the operation of this vast machinery as an offset for the multitude of evils which it brings upon your species?"I replied, "I cannot tell."- "What," continued Lunarius, "dost thou know of no good derived from it to thine unhappy race, to compensate for all the anguish and blood and death, which it pro- duces?"I said, "I know of none." - Wilt thou not, then, O mortal man!" he asked again, in tones of the deepest earnestness, "wilt thou not assemble the wise men of your earth, -your philosophers and sages and physiologists, your moralists and good men,--that I may diligently inquire of them; that I may understand this great mystery; that this enigma may be solved before I return to my native sphere?"I   OF LUNARIUS.      13 said, "I will try." Thereupon, I jmmedi- ately called the trumnpeter, and told him to sound the trumpet shrill and long. By the time it had done sounding, I saw before me, or imagined I saw before me (I need not tell which, it matters not), a vast assemblage of the wise men of the earth, venerable for age and learning and wisdom, among whom I discovered presidents and -governors and senators and kings and emperors and jurists and physicians and divines and apostles and prophets and farmers and mechanics; in- deed, all classes of our race were repre- sented in the vast assembly. They had come to aid Lunarius in his investigations, and furnish him, if in their power, with a solution of the painful difficulty he had en- countered in his inquiries into the condition of man.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7131-00000009"/> "    'hrnE INVESTIGATIONS Lunarius, from his aerial seat, with an air of majesty, benignity, and grace, and in tones of deep earnestness and solemnity, immediately addressed himself to his dis- tinguished auditors, who listened with the most respectful, attention to the celestial visitant. Time would fail me to recapitulate his exordium, or, indeed, anything more than the numerous questions propounded by Lu- narius, and the substance merely of the re- plies made by his learned and distinguished catechumens, expressed in the briefest man- ner possible. Should I have written it all down, it would have made a library as large as the Encyclopaedia. After a suitable address, Lunarius thus began his inquiries:-- O men! - inhabitants of this terrestrial   eI     OF LUNARIUS.      15 globe, -can you tell me wherein is the good that men propose to themselves by this vast enginery and apparatus, with which almost all your race seem to be more or less con- nected, and which, so far as I am yet able to discover, is productive of evil only? Bear with me while I inquire in detail: "1. Are these streams on which so many seem to feed, productive of any nourishment to the body?" The response was distinct and universal, that chemical analysis and universal ex- perience have demonstrated that there is no more nourishment in a draught of these waters than there is in a flash of light- ning  "2. Well, do they not prevent disease?" Dr. John James, late of Upper Alton, in behalf of his profession, arose and replied  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7131-00000010"/> 16    THNl INVESTIGATIONS emphatically, that these waters have an in- jurious influence in all the diseases that affect the human system. They originate many, and aggravate and add to the pain and danger of all. "3. I perceive," said Lunarius, "that when a man first comes in contact with them, he seems to be stronger. Do they not increase permanently a man's strength?" The venerable Dr. Rush replied, "They impair strength." "4. Well, my good doctor," continued Lunarius, "let me ask, do they not improve the appetite?" Dr. Rush again, in behalf of the whole profession, replied, "They occasion a decay of appetite." "5. Do they not allay thirst?" Many voices answered, "The oftener and   OF LUNARrUS.      17 more a man drinks of them, the oftener and more thirsty will he be." "6. Do they not promote digestion?" Dr. Sewell, who has investigated this point thoroughly, and published to the world a picture of the living stomach of one who had taken frequent draughts at these streams, stepped forward, and declared that "The use of these waters deranges the func- tions of the stomach, and, if persisted in, seldom fails to change its organic struct- ure." 7. Do they not fortify the body against the effects of cold weather?" "This is far from being true," promptly answered Dr. Rush.  "The temporary warmth it produces is always succeded by a greater disposition in the body to be affected by the cold." 2  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7131-00000011"/> 18    THE INVESTIGATIONS "8. Doctor, are they not necessary in warm weather?" "As well," replied the doctor, " might we throw oil into a house, the roof of which was on fire, in order to prevent the flames from extending to its inside, as pour these in- flammable waters into the stomach to lessen the effects of a hot sun upon the skin.' 9. I observe," said Lunarius, " that these waters are much used by the husbandmen while gathering in the produce of the soil. Pray be so good as to inform me, are they not necessary in time of haying and har- vest?" A farmer instantly replied, "Ever since I banished them from my farm I have had my crops got into my barns in better order, and in better season, and with less trouble than before."   OF LUNARIUS.      19 "10. Are they not necessary for firemen on board of steamboats?" asked Lunarius. Captain Holcomb, known to many western travellers, replied, "I have run a steam- boat the whole length of the western waters for a whole season together, without losing a trip, or suffering an accident, and not a drop was allowed to the hands on board." "11. Are they not necessary for seamen in the coldest latitudes?" An English sailor replied, that "'A Danish crew of sixty men, well supplied with provisions and thesefiery waters, attempted to winter in Hudson's Bay; but fifty-eight of them died before spring. An English crew of twenty-two men, destitute of these waters, and obliged to be almost constantly exposed to the cold, wintered in the same bay, and only two of them died."  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7131-00000012"/> 20    THE INVESTIGATIONS "12. I perceive," said Lunarius, "they temporarily increase strength and agility. Is that increased activity and strength usually expended in useful purposes?" Several voices instantly replied, "If run- ning, jumping, wrestling, fighting, and act- ing like a bear, a tiger, or a monkey, be useful, then we might answer this question in the affirmative." "13. Do they not make a mail more in- telligent and wise?" A venerable patriarch, in behalf of the whole assembly, gravely replied, that the experience of thousands of the race, and the observations of millions more, go to show, that although they make a man wise in His own conceit, they make him a fool in the estimation of everybody else; that although they give a wild and mad-   i OF LUNARIUS.      21 dening impulse to the brain for a short interval, they eventually impair. and waste its energies. And our holy oracles affirm that, "whoso is deceived thereby is not wise." "14. Do they not strengthen the mem- ory?" Dr. Sewell replied, "The memory is enfeebled, and sometimes quite obliterated by their use." "15. Well, doctor, do they not strength- en the judgment?" Doctor Sewell replied, "The judgment becomes clouded and impaired in its strength under their influence." And Dr. Warren, a distinguished surgeon, added, that "No surgeon having an important operation to' perform could safely take even one glass of wine,"  the weakest  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7131-00000013"/> 22    THE INVESTIGATIONS form of these waters, -"for it would dis- turb his judgment in a greater or less degree." "16. tWill they not make a mechanic more skilful?" A mechanic replied, by exclaiming sar- castically, "Whoever heard of a man being better qualified to put a watch together, or some other intricate machinery, byfirst getting drunk!" "17. I have noticed," said Lunarius, "that they temporarily excite men's intel- lects to greater action. Is not that in- creased action usually judicious and use- ful?" The moral and intellectual philosophers responded, "We often hear of men being better fitted to serve the devil. But who ever heard of a man's devising better plans   OF LUNARIUS.      23 for serving God and his country when drunk than when sober?" "18. Will they not raise a man in his own sober estimation?" A Washingtonian replied, "After I had recovered from their influence, I loathed and despised myself more heartily than I did the very reptiles that crawled on the ground." "19. Does not the business, upon the whole, promote in men habits of cleanliness and decency?" A voice promptly responded, For an answer to this question, O Lunarius, turn your head into the door of one of the common tap-rooms whence these burning waters ooze out; and, if you can withstand the column of noxious vapors that is ever oozing from them, stand in your tracks  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7131-00000014"/> 24    THEit INVESTIGATIONS long enough to witness the degraded, miserable remnants of men, entangled in the meshes of Satan, staggering, loung- ing, spewing, foaming, and wallowing in their own filth and shame. Or, :for another example, you may see one literally lying with a dozen hogs in the mud and filth, - a spectacle which is not unfrequently wit- nessed." "20. Will they not enable a man to make better bargains?" A farmer replied, that he had known a man to barter away even the rails that enclosed his cornfield, and turn it into the commons, after drinking a glass or two of these waters, when only an hour or two before the very proposition was treated with the utmost scorn. "21. But," continued Lunarius, "will they   OF LUNARIUS.      25 not make a man more careful in contracting debts?" A sherif present replied, that he had, in the performance of official duty, sold many valuable estates to pay debts fool- ishy contracted under the influence of the insanity occasioned by these waters. "22. But do they not insure greater punctuality in the payment of debts?" All the merchants present responded, that nearly all their bad debts were against intemperate men. "23. Do they not promote a man's cred- it?"' A sagacious merchant replied, that he had recently refused a man credit for no other reason than because his breath smelled of the liquors from these pestilen- tial streams.  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7131-00000015"/> 236   iTHE INVESTIGATIONS "24. Will they not protect a man from insult and violence?" asked Lunarius. To this the whole congregation re- sponded, "There is no class of men on this terrestrial globe so often abused and laughed at, and maimed and robbed, and stripped of everything, as the poor drunk- ard." "25. Will they not make a man more re- spectchle?"  The congregationagain replied, "There is no man more shunned as a companion than the drunkard." 26. But do they not increase his useful- ness " asked Lunarius. A philosopher replied, "A man's useful- ness depends upon the action of his body or his mind, or both. How can his usefulness, then, be promoted by that which destroys   OF LUNARIUS.      27 both? As well talk of increasing the strength of a horse by cutting his ham- strings." "27. Will they not make a man a kinder, and better, and more provident husband and father," asked the celestial visitant. A philanthropist, who had been much in the habit of visiting the abodes of wretched- ness, immediately arose and said, "Permit me, as an appropriate answer to this ques- tion, to relate something I recently heard in a wretched  cabin that I visited. 'Mother,' said a little pale-faced, sickly- looking boy, - mother, this bread is very hard. Why don't we have cake and nice things as we used to when we lived in the great house? Oh, that was such a pretty house, mamma, and such a pleasant garden, all filled with flowers; and you made such  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7131-00000016"/> 28    THE INVESTIGATIONS sweet music with your fingers, and pa would sing. Pa used to laugh then, and tell me pretty stories, and take me on his knee, and say I was his own dear boy.  Mamma, what makes pa so sick, and look so bad? It makes me afraid when he stamps on the floor, and says so loud, "George, go off to bed." Mamma, will he get well again, and take me on his knee again, and sing me a sweet song, and love me as he used to do? Mamma, what makes you cry? Did I make you cry? It makes me sorry to see you so sad and unhappy. Won't you wipe away your tears, and smile again? ' "'My son! O my George! My child! Your father is a drunkard!'" "28. But do they not make a woman a better wife, or more kind and faithful mother?"   OF LUNARIUS.      29 The whole congregation, in horror, ex- claimed, "A drunken wife! A  drunken mother! Spareus, spare us, O Lunarius!" "29. Well, then, do they not promote the respectability of a man's family?" The whole vast assembly responded as with the voice of one man, "We have never heard of a family being more respected by the virtuous and good in consequence of using these liquors. We can point to thou- sands of families whose reputation has been ruined, but not to one whose respectability has been increased by them." "30. Do not these waters promote the interest, eventually, of the dealers them- selves?" Here, Rev. Dr. Edwards, who had spent much time in investigating this point, arose and stated many facts, only one of which I  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7131-00000017"/> 30    THE INVESTIGATIONS can here repeat. "In a single county, in the State of New York," said he, "of two hundred and seventeen dealers, one hundred and fifty-five failed in their business, and seventy-nine are known to have died drunk- ards." "31. Well, does not the drinking or dealing in these liquors promote peace of mind. " "Oh, the indescribable horrors of mind I have suffered!" exclaimed a Washingtonian. "I have felt at times such a sinking it seemed to me I could not live. I could compare my feelings to nothing but a burning fire. "- "We were compelled to quit the business," exclaimed several voices, "because we could have no peace of mind while we remained in it."- "Well may they tremble," added Chief Justice Daggett, "lest the blood of   OF LUNARIUS.      31 murdered bodies and souls should be re- quired at their hands." "32. Are they not favorable to the virtue of a man's family?" "If you will cast your eye, O Lunarius, over the whole surface of this globe," re- sponded the great congregation, " you will find no class of children so vicious, and so destitute of all moral culture, as those of the drunkard, and especially the children of the drunkard-maker." "33. Will they not prevent men from committing suicide?" * A reformed drunkard exclaimed, "I was strongly tempted to put an end to myself." Another said, "Many a time have I felt life to be really a burden, and, but for the fear of plunging into still deeper woes, it would have cost me but little effort to terminate in  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7131-00000018"/> 32    THE INVESTIGATIONS the most summary manner my existence." A coroner also testified that three-fourths of all the suicides are instigated by these liquors. ' 34. Well, do they not silence the tongue of slander?9? Rev. Dr. Beecher, an eminent divine, re- plied, "If the tongue ever sets on firb the whole course of nature, and is itself set on fire of hell, it is when stimulated by these fiery potations. "35. But," said Lunarius, "let me inquire again, will they not add to the comforts of a man's house, keep its windows whole, the roof from leaks, his garden clean of weeds, his fences whole, his gates locked, his bars put up, his hogs yoked, or his cattle and hbrses fat?"

A former mayor of the city of Alton arose and said emphatically, "I have often thought, if there was any class of men under the heavens of the Lord entirely destitute of sympathy, it is the rum-seller." He il- lustrated it by a variety of facts. "37. Do they not promote purity of thought and action?" A philanthopist replied, that those dens of infamy in our large cities would scarcely be sustained but for the influence of stim. ulating drinks.

"38. Do they not promote a man's liberty?" asked Lunarius. The multitude answered, "They are the greatest incentives to slavery that exist on the globe. They make the man a slave of his appetites and passions. They trip up, his feet without violence, and bind him hand and foot in the gutter without chains." "39. Do they not diminish the tenants of your penitentiaries?" Rev. Louis Dwighlt, Secretary of the American Prison Discipline Society, an- swered, "Four-fifths of all the inmates com- mitted their crimes under the influence of these liquors." "40. Well," said Lunarius, "do they not empty your poor-houses?"   OF LUNARIUS.      35 Several overseers of the poor replied, that of one thousand nine hundred and sixty-four paupers in different alms-houses, one thou- sand seven hundred and ninety were made paupers by partaking of these intoxicating liquors. "41. Do they not deter from deeds of violence and murder?" A judge replied, "Of eleven murders committed, all except one were committed by intemperance." Another judge said, "Of twenty cases of murder examined by me, all were occasioned by these spirituous liquors." Another said, "Of more than two hundred murders which were committed in the Uni- ted States in one year, nearly all were said to have their origin in drinking from these streams." "42.

Moses, the great Jewish lawgiver, who ruled a greater nation than France, testified of Noah that he I began to be an husband- man, and planted a vineyard, and he drank of the wine and was drunk." King Solomon, also testified that "Wine is a mocker, and strong drink is raging (and he knew of no stronger drink than wine). He also ex- dlaimed, with manifest emotion, "Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath con- tentions? who hath babblings? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?

And, finally, the injunction of the Apostle Paul was quoted, "Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess," etc. "43.

It was testi- fied that he had drank nothing stronger that day. When he got sober, and realized what he had done, his remorse and anguish were so great, he committed suicide in the jail at Edwardsville. "44. Ye men of the healing art, while ye are up, allow me to ask you a question of some importance. Are they necessary as a medicine?" Dr. Chapman, in behalf of his profession, replied, That " so far from it, it is the duty of physicians to discountenance the popular notion of their remedial eicacy."

To these sentiments all the physicians   OF LUNARIUS.      39 present assented, among whom were more than seven hundred from the British me- tropolis alone, and, to show their sincerity, every one of the seven hundred signed the certificate with his own hand. An aged man also testified that he had used these ardent waters as an invalid, for many years. He gave them up, and got well. It was the remedy that kept up the disease; and when he renounced the one, he got well of the other. "45. Well, doctors, let me ask again, do they not prolong life?" Dr. Hossack replied, that the amount of human life gained by temperance, to the society of Friends, is more than the differ- ence between thirty-three and forty-seven, an average of fourteen years gained in every life, which is equal to forty-two per cent.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7131-00000022"/> 40    'THE' INVESTIGATIONS Doctor James also said, 'They coincide with the causes, aggravate the form, and increase the danger of every disease that affects the human body or mind. They shorten the term of human life, even when used temperately." All the physicians pres- ent -many thousands in number-arose and said, "This testimony is true." "46. Do they not secure for men the watchful care and soothing attentions of kind and sympathizing friends, on a bed of sickness and death, and a respectful and decent burial?"

"In India a native physician declares that people who do not take spirits or opium do not catch the disease, even when they are with those who have it." As the pestilence swept over India years ago, it was stated that, "in the army, consisting of eighteen thousand men, more than half of the men died in the first twelve days;" the free use of intoxicating liquors was as- signed as the cause. Mr. Hubor, who saw two thousand one hundred and sixty perish in twenty-five days, in one town in Russia, says, "It is a most remarkable circumstance, that persons given to drinking have been swept away like flies.

It is also stated by com- putation that five-sixths of all who have fallen by this disease in England were taken from the ranks of the intemperate and disso- lute. A physician, who-visited Montreal, during the prevalence of cholera in the summer of 1852, says, "The victims of the disease are the intemperate; it invaria- bly cuts them off." In that city, after there had been one thousand two hundred cases of the malady, a Montreal journal states that" not a drunkard who has been attacked has recovered, and almost all the victims to it have been at least moderate drinkes "   OF LUNARIUS.     43 A reliable gentleman of New York city says of that period when the scourge visited that city, "Facts abundantly authorize the conclusion, that had it not been for the sale and use of spirits, there had not been cholera enough in the city of New York to have caused the cessation of business for a single day." A gentleman residing in the city at the time has thus marked the connection be- tween rum and cholera: "A quantity of spirits was taken from a certain store in the morning, and distributed to a number of grogshops. In the evening the workmen assembled and received their accustomed quantity. The next morning one, and another, and another, were carried by my door to the hospital, and in the afternoon were taken to the Potter's Field."  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7131-00000024"/> "    THE INVESTIGATIONS The coroner of Madison County, Illinois, furnished the following answer to this in- quiry. On the 15th day of August, 1838, he was called to hold an inquest over the body of Edward Glennon, found in the field of Mr. Debow. It was shown that, on Wednesday 11th previous, he had got drunk at Burrett's grocery, and had filled his bottle at the tap-room, aud on his way home had tumbled over the fence into the field aforesaid, which was the last that was seen of him till the 15th. When found, his head was severed from his body, and lay several yards from it, with the flesh mostly gnawed off by the dogs. One arm was found a few yards from the body, in another direction, also mangled and partly devoured. The body, having been for three days ex- posed to the intense heat of the sun, pre-   OF LUNARIUS.      45 sented a most loathsome mass of putrefac- tion. After the coroner's inquest, a hole was dug close by, and with the aid of their spades the remnant of his putrefied carcass was tumbled into the ground. The verdict of the jury was, that these waters had brought him to his death. "47. Do they not," asked Lunarius, " make bread, that upon which your species mainly subsist, more abundant?" The editor of the "New York American" here arose and said, that he had ascer- tained that more grain was consumed in the distilleries in the city of New York than is consumed by all the inhabitants of the city. "48. Well, do these waters increase the value of property?" Several political economists replied, that ?  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7131-00000025"/> "    THE INVESTIGATIONS in those towns and villages where these streams had been excluded, property was worth from twenty-five to one hundred per cent. more than where they were permitted still to flow. "49. But do they not prevent shipwrecks and steamboat disasters?" One who escaped the wreck of the Ben Sherod, in 1837, arose and testified that just before that fearful disaster, by which one hundred and fifty human beings were hur- ried into eternity, a barrel of whiskey was placed on deck, for the use of the hands, who drank to excess, and became intoxi- cated. Others testified ithat the no less dis- astrous fates of the steamboats Home, the Lexington, and the Erie, were owing to the same cause. "50. Is not the dealing in these waters   OF LUNARIUS.      47 regarded as a safe business to the commu- nity?" To this inquiry the magistrates replied, that the tapsters are required by the laws of all the States to give bonds to keep the peace, in a large sum of money, which req- uisition is made of no other class of busi- ness men, and would not, of course, be made of these, were it considered a per- fectly safe business. "51. Do not these streams promote quiet- ness along the streets " The magistrates again replied that nearly all the quarrelling and cow-hiding, and fight- ing, and pistolling, and drinking, are excited by these. "52. Do they not promote subordination to the laws?" asked Lunarius.

Leave being granted, the following items were read: "Soon after dark there were unwonted gatherings in certain coffee-houses. Here the spirit of vengeance which had been rankling in their hearts was excited to desperation by 'spirit behind, the counter. In about an hour after, when the mob had had time to revive their spirits, and recruit their courage in the aforesaid coffee-houses, they returned with increased numbers, armed with guns, muskets, etc., and re- commenced the attack with renewed vio- ence.

A judge arose and said, "I will tell you Lunarius, how this operates. A man was indicted by the Municipal Court of Alton for a heinous crime.  While the jury were retired, contrary to law, a stream of these waters was let into the room. Sev- eral of them drank of it. One in particular, who was infdvor of convicting the prisoner, after he had drank, swore he would go in for clearing him. The jury were unable to agree, and they returned into court without any decision.

To this a reformed drunkard replied. that "he had controlled, at a single elec- tion, more than one hundred votes by whis- key. And," added he, "I cal do it again.' "55. Well, then, do they not add dig nity, wisdom, and efficiency, to your legis lative councils?" Henry A. Wise, then a distinguished and loyal member of Congress, from Vir ginia, arose and said, "I will answer that question. I state the fact to the nation, said he, "that some of the higher execu tive officers at Washington are, and have been, notorious drunkards.

Extracts were also read from the Rec- ord of Congress, as recent as the 11th and 12th of April, 1866, to the ef- fect, that in the Senate a resolution was offered to prohibit the sale. of spirituous liquors in the capitol building.

Major-General McClellan, of the Army of the Potomac, said, "No one evil so much obstructs this army in its progress to that condition which will enable it to accomplish all that true soldiers can, as the degrading vice of' drunkenness.  It is the cause of by far the greater part of the disorders which are tried by courts martial. It is impossible to estimate the benefits that would accrue to the service from the adoption of a resolution, on the part of the officers, to set their men an example of total abstinence from intoxicat- ing drinks. It would be worth fifty thou- sand men to the army of the United States."   OF LUNARIUS.      55 "58. Do they not perpetuate estates and families 9? asked Lunarius. Rev.

In another tow n of thir- teen hundred inhabitants, thirty-seven farms changed owners from the same cause, in the same time.

At Lille, at Rouen, there are some so satu- rated with it, that their infants refuse to take the breast of a sober woman. In the mountains of the Vosges infants drink eau de vie.

As an answer to this question, a para- graph from a paper printed in Alton, in August, 1840, was sent up to Lunarius, which he was requested to read, as follows: "A rumseller died a few weeks since in U.
