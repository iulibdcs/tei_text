            <p>To all, as they pass through the world, come "light and shadow." Though the sun may
               be in the heavens, clouds often intervene, and cast deep shadows about our footsteps.
               But, it is a truth which we cannot too deeply lay to heart, that, in our life, as in
               nature, the exhalations which form the obscuring cloud arise from below. They are not
               born in the pure heavens, but spring out of the earth beneath. If there was nothing
               evil in the mind, there would be no cloud in the sky of our being,—all would be
               "eternal sunshine."</p>
            <p>If, therefore, in this book the lights and shadows are blessed; if, in a word, the
               clouds often hang heavy and remain long in the sky, the fault is in those whose
               histories we have written. But the sky does not always remain dark. As the heart
               becomes filled with better purposes through the trials and pains of adversity, or
               comes out purer from the furnace of affliction, the clouds disperse, and the blessed
               sunlight comes again. Lay this up for your consolation, all ye who are in trouble and
               affliction, and look hopefully in the future. It will not always remain dark as in
               the present time.</p>

            <head>PUBLISHER'S INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>ACCOMPANYING this volume, is a brief auto-biography. In circulating Mr. Arthur's
               "Sketches of Life and Character," the publisher met so frequently with an expressed
               desire to know something of one whose writings had made him a general favorite that
               he was led to solicit a personal sketch, to go with a new collection of his writings.
               It is but due to the author to say, that his concurrence in the matter was not
               without considerable reluctance. From this sketch it will be seen that Mr. Arthur is
               a self-made man, and that he has gained his present enviable position through long
               and patient labor, and against the pressure of much that was adverse and
               discouraging. In his elevation he has this pleasing reflection, that in seeking to
               gain a high place for himself, he has dragged no one down, but rather, sought to
               carry along, in his upward way, all who could be induced to go with him.</p>
            <p>The portrait given in this volume, was engraved from one recently painted by Lambdin,
               and is considered a very good likeness. Mr. Arthur is now in his forty-second year,
               and looks somewhat younger than the artist has represented him.</p>
            <p>For the information of those who wish to procure Mr. Arthur's Temperance Tales, the
               publisher would state, that in "Lights and Shadows of Real Life," are included all
               the stories contained in the recently issued edition of "Illustrated Temperance
               Tales," besides nearly two hundred pages of additional matter, thus making a larger,
               more miscellaneous, and more acceptable book for all readers.</p>

            <head>BRIEF AUTOBIOGRAPHY.</head>
            <p>In compliance with the earnest request of the publisher of this volume, I have, with
               a reluctance that I find it difficult to overcome, consented to furnish a brief
               sketch personal to myself. Although my name has been constantly appearing for some
               twelve or fifteen years, yet I have lost none of that, shrinking from notoriety and
               observation which made me timid and retiring when a boy. The necessity to write as a
               means of livelihood, and to write a great deal, has brought me so frequently before
               the public, that I have almost ceased to think about the matter as any thing more
               than an ordinary occurrence; but, now, when called upon to write about myself, I find
               that the edge of a natural sensitiveness is quite as keen as ever. But, I will call
               the feeling a weakness, and try to repress it until I have finished my present
               task.</p>
            <p>I was born in the year 1809, near Newburgh, Orange County, New York; and my eyes
               first opened on the beautiful scenery of the Hudson. My earliest recollection is of
               Fort Montgomery, some six miles below West Point, on the river, where my parents
               resided for a few years previous to 1817. In the Spring of that year, they removed to
               Baltimore, which became my place of residence until 1841, when I came to
               Philadelphia, where I have since lived.</p>
            <p>My early educational advantages were few. There were no public schools in Maryland,
               when I was a boy, and, as my father had a large family and but a moderate income, he
               could afford to send his children to school only for a limited period. He knew the
               value, however, of a good education, and did all for us in his power. Especially did
               he seek to inspire his children with a regard for religious truth, and, both by
                  precept<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5627-00000004"/> and example, to lead them into the
               practice of such things as were honest and of good rest. In all this, he was warmly
               seconded by a mother who still survives; and for whom, it is but just to say, that
               her children feel the tenderest regard—and well may they do so, for they owe her
               much.</p>
            <p>At school, I was considered a very dull boy. My memory was not retentive, and I
               comprehended ideas and formulas expressed by others in a very imperfect manner. I
               needed a careful, judicious, and patient teacher, who understood the character of my
               mind, and who was able to come down to it with instruction in the simplest and
               clearest forms; thus helping me to think for myself and to see for myself. Instead of
               this, I was scolded and whipped because I could not understand things that were never
               explained. As, for instance, a slate and pencil were placed in my hands after I had
               learned to read, upon which was a sum in simple addition for which I was required to
               find an answer. Now, in the word, "Addition," as referring to figures, I saw no
               meaning. I did not comprehend the fact, in connexion with it, that two and two made
               four. True, I had learned my "Addition Table," but, strangely enough, that did not
               furnish me with any clue towards working out the problem of figures set for me on my
               slate. I was then in my ninth year; and I can remember, to this day, with perfect
               distinctness, how utterly discouraged I became, as day by day went by, and still I
               had not found a correct result to any one of my sums, nor gained a single ray of
               light on the subject. Strange as it may seem, I remained for several months in simple
               addition before I knew how to sum up figures, and then the meaning of addition
               flashed, in a sudden thought upon my mind, while I was at play. I had no trouble
               after that. During the next week, I escaped both scolding and "belaboring" (a
               favorite phrase of my teacher's), and then passed on to subtraction. Five minutes
               devoted to an explanation, in some simple form, of what "Addition" meant, would have
               saved me the loss of months, to say nothing of the pain, both mental and bodily, that
               I suffered during the time.</p>
            <p>With such a mind and such a teacher, it is no wonder that I made but little progress
               during the few years that I went to school. Beyond reading and writing, Arithmetic
               and English Grammar included the entire range of my studies. As for Arithmetic, I did
               not master half the common rules, and Grammar was to my mind completely
               unintelligible.</p>
            <p>In the end, my teacher, declared that it was only wasting time and money to send me
               to school, and advised my father to put me out to a trade. This was done. I left home
               and entered upon an apprenticeship shortly after passing my thirteenth year.</p>
            <p>If I found it extremely difficult to comprehend ideas as expressed in ordinary
               written forms, I was not without thoughts of my own. I had an active mind, and soon
               after entering upon my apprenticeship the desire for knowledge became strong. As food
               for this was supplied, even though in a stinted measure, the desire gained strength,
               and I began a system of self-education that was continued for years afterwards. Of
               course, the system was a very imperfect one. There was no one to select books for me,
               nor to direct my mind in its search after knowledge. I was an humble apprentice boy,
               inclined from habit to shrink from observation, and preferring to grope about in the
               dark for what I was in search off, rather than intrude my wants and wishes upon
               others. Day after day I worked and thought, and night after night I read and studied,
               while other boys were seeking pleasure and recreation. Thus, through much
               discouragement, the years passed by; and thus time went on, until I attained the age
               of manhood, when, defective sight compelled me to give up the trade I had been
               acquiring for over seven years.</p>
            <p>Beyond this trade, my ability to earn a living was small. My efforts at
               self-education had been guided by no definite aims in life. I had read, studied and
               thought, more to gratify a desire for knowledge than to gain information with the end
               of applying it to any particular use. The consequence was, that on reaching manhood,
               I entered the world at a great disadvantage. My trade, to learn which I had spent so
               many years, could not be followed, except at the risk of losing my sight, which had
               failed for the three preceding years with such rapidity that I was now compelled to
               use glasses of strong magnifying power. I had but slight knowledge of figures, and
               was not, therefore, competent, to take the situation of a clerk. At this point in my
               life, I suffered from great discouragement of mind. Through the kind offices of a
               friend, a place was procured for me in a counting room, at a very small salary, where
               but light service was required, and where I found but few opportunities for acquiring
               a knowledge of business. Here I remained for over three years, almost as much shut
                  out<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5627-00000005"/> from contact with the business world as
               when an apprentice, and with plenty of time on my hands for reading and writing,
               which I improved.</p>
            <p>The necessity for a larger income caused me to leave this place, and accept of one in
               which a higher ability was required. In 1833 I went to the West as agent for a
               Banking Company; but the institution failed and I returned to Baltimore, out of
               employment. During all this time, I was devoting my leisure moments to writing, not
               that I looked forward to authorship as a trade—nothing could have been more foreign
               to my thoughts;—I continued to write, as I had begun, prompted by an impulse that I
               felt little inclination to resist.</p>
            <p>At this point in my life, I was induced, in association with a friend who was as fond
               of writing as myself, to assume the editorial charge of a literary paper. And here
               began, in earnest, my literary labors, that have since continued with only brief
               periods of intermission.</p>
            <p>As an author, I have never striven for mere reputation; have never sought to make a
               name. Circumstances, over which I had little control, guided my feet, and I walked
               onward in the path that opened before me, not doubting but that I was in the right
               way. If other employment had offered; if I had received a good business education,
               and been able, through that means, to have advanced myself in the world, I would,
               like thousands of others who had an early fondness for literary pursuits, soon have
               laid aside my pen and given to trade the best energies of my mind. But Providence
               guided my feet into other paths than these. They were rough and thorny at times, and
               I often fainted by the way; yet renewed strength ever came when I felt the weakest.
               If my earnest labor has not been so well rewarded in a money-sense as it might have
               been had I possessed a business education at the time of my entrance upon life, my
               reward in another sense has been great. Though I have not been able to accumulate
               wealth, I have gained what wealth alone cannot give, a wide-spread acknowledgment
               that in my work I have done good to my fellow men. This acknowledgment comes back
               upon me from all directions, and I will not deny that it affords me a deep interior
               satisfaction. Could it be otherwise? And with this heart-warming satisfaction, there
               arises ever in my mind a new impulse, prompting to still more earnest efforts in the
               cause of humanity.</p>
            <p>My choice of temperance themes has not arisen from any experience in my own person of
               the evils of intemperance, but from having been an eye and ear witness to some of the
               first results of Washingtonianism, and seeing, in the cause, one worthy the best
               efforts of my pen. The temperance cause I recognized as a good cause, and I gave it
               the benefit of whatever talent I possessed. And I have the pleasant assurance, from
               very many who have had better opportunities to know than myself, that my labor has
               not been in vain. Thus much I have ventured to write of myself. Beyond this, let my
               works speak for me. I can say no more.</p>

               <head>THE FACTORY GIRL.</head>
               <p>THERE was something wrong about the affairs of old Mr. Bacon. His farm, once the
                  best tilled and most productive in the neighbourhood, began to show evidences of
                  neglect and unfruitfulness; and that he was going behindhand in the world, was too
                  apparent in the fact, that, within two years he had sold twenty acres of good
                  meadow, and, moreover, was under the necessity of borrowing three hundred dollars
                  on a mortgage of his landed property. And yet, Mr. Bacon had not laid aside his
                  habits of industry. He was up, as of old, with the dawn, and turned not his feet
                  homeward from the field until the sun had taken his parting glance from the
                  distant hill-tops.</p>
               <p>A kind-hearted, cheerful-minded man was old Mr. Bacon, well liked by all his
                  neighbours, and loved by his own household. His two oldest children died ere
                  reaching the age of manhood; three remained. Mary Bacon, the eldest of those who
                  survived, now in her nineteenth year, had been from earliest childhood her
                  father's favourite; and, as she advanced towards womanhood, she had grown more and
                  more into his heart. In his eyes she was very beautiful; and his eyes, though
                  partial, did not deceive him very greatly, for Mary's face was fair to look
                  upon.</p>
               <p>We have said that Mr. Bacon was a kind-hearted cheerful-minded man. And so he was;
                  kind-hearted and cheerful, even though clouds were beginning to darken above him,
                  and a sigh from the coming tempest was in the air. Yet not so uniformly cheerful
                  as of old, though never moody nor perverse in his tempers. Of the change that was
                  in progress, the change from prosperity to adversity, he did not seem to be
                     <emph>painfully</emph> conscious.</p>
               <p>Yes, there was something wrong about the affairs of old Mr. Bacon. A habit
                  indulged through many years, had acquired a dangerous influence over him, and was
                  gradually destroying his rational ability to act well in the ordinary<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000008"/> concerns of life. As a young man, Mr. Bacon drank
                  "temperately," and he drank "temperately" in the prime of life; and now, at sixty,
                  he continued to drink "temperately," that is, in his own estimation. There were
                  many, however, who had reason to think differently. But Mr. Bacon was no bar-room
                  lounger; in fact, he rarely, if ever, went to a public house; it was in his own
                  home and among his household treasures, that he placed to his lips the cup of
                  confusion.</p>
               <p>The various temperance reforms had all found warm advocates among his friends and
                  neighbours; but Mr. Bacon stood aloof. He would have nothing to do in these
                  matters.</p>
               <p>"Let them join temperance societies who feel themselves in danger," was his good
                  natured answer to all argument or persuasion addressed to him on the subject.</p>
               <p>He did not oppose nor ridicule the movement. He thought it a good thing; only, he
                  had in it no personal interest.</p>
               <p>And so Mr. Bacon went on drinking "temperately" until habit, from claiming a
                  moderate indulgence, began to make, so it seemed to his friends, rather
                  unreasonable demands. Besides this habit of drinking, Mr. Bacon had another habit,
                  that of industry; and, what was unusual, the former did not abate the latter,
                  though it must be owned that it sadly interfered with its efficiency. He was up,
                  as we have said, with the dawn, and all the day he was busy at work; but, somehow
                  or other, his land did not produce as liberally as in former times, and there was
                  slowly creeping over every thing around him an aspect of decay. Moreover, he did
                  not manage, as well as formerly, the selling part of his business. In fact, his
                  shrewdness of mind was gone. Alcohol had confused his brain. Gradually he was
                  retrograding; and, while more than half conscious of the ruin that was in advance
                  of him, he was not fully enough awake to feel seriously alarmed, nor to begin
                  anxiously to seek for the cause of impending evil. And so it went on until Mr.
                  Bacon, suddenly found himself in the midst of real trouble. The value of his farm,
                  which, after parting with the twenty acres of meadow land, contained but
                  twenty-five acres, had been yearly diminishing in consequence of bad culture, and
                  defective management of his stock had reduced that until it was of little
                  consequence.</p>
               <p>The holder of the mortgage was a man named Dyer, who kept a tavern in the village
                  that lay a mile distant from the little white farm-house of Mr. Bacon. When Dyer
                  commenced his liquor-selling trade, for that was his principal business, he had
                  only a few hundred dollars; now he was worth thousands, and was about the only man
                  in the neighbourhood who had money to lend. His loans were always made on bond and
                  mortgage, and, it was a little remarkable, that he was never known to let a sober,
                  industrious farmer or store-keeper have a single dollar. But, a drinking man, who
                  was gradually wasting his substance, rarely applied to him in vain; for he was the
                  cunning spider watching for the silly fly. More than one worn-out and run-down
                  farm had already come into his hands, through the foreclosure of mortgages, at a
                  time of business depression, when his helpless victims could find no sympathizing
                  friends able to save them from ruin.</p>
               <p>One day, in mid-winter, as Mr. Bacon was cutting wood at his rather poorly
                  furnished wood pile, the tavern-keeper rode up. There was something in his
                  countenance that sent a creeping sense of fear to the heart of the farmer.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Mr. Dyer," said he.</p>
               <p>"Good morning," returned the tavern-keeper, formally. His usual smile was absent
                  from his face.</p>
               <p>"Sharp day, this."</p>
               <p>"Yes, rather keen."</p>
               <p>"Won't you walk in and take something?"</p>
               <p>"No, thank you. H-h-e-em!"</p>
               <p>There was a pause.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Bacon."</p>
               <p>The farmer's eye sunk beneath the cold steady look of Dyer.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Bacon, I guess I shall have to call on you for them three hundred dollars,"
                  said the tavern-keeper, in a firm voice.</p>
               <p>"Can't pay that mortgage now, Mr. Dyer," returned Bacon, with a troubled
                  expression; "no use to think of it."</p>
               <p>"Rather a cool way to treat a man after borrowing his money. I told you when I
                  lent it that I might want it at almost any time."</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, Mr. Dyer. It was understood, distinctly, that<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000009"/> from four to six months' notice would be given,"
                  replied Mr. Bacon, positively.</p>
               <p>"Preposterous!" ejaculated the tavern-keeper. "Never thought of such a thing. Six
                  months notice, indeed!"</p>
               <p>"That was the agreement," said Mr. Bacon, firmly.</p>
               <p>"Is it in the bond?"</p>
               <p>"No, it was verbal, between us."</p>
               <p>Dyer shook his head, as he answered,—</p>
               <p>"No, sir. I never make agreements of that kind; the money was to be paid on
                  demand, and I have ridden over this morning to make the demand."</p>
               <p>"It is midwinter, Mr. Dyer," was replied in a husky voice.</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"You know that a small farmer, like me, cannot be in possession, at this season,
                  of the large sum you demand."</p>
               <p>"That is your affair, Mr. Bacon. I want my money now, and must have it."</p>
               <p>There was a tone of menace in the way this was said that Mr. Bacon fully
                  understood.</p>
               <p>"I haven't thirty dollars, much less three hundred, in my possession," said
                  he.</p>
               <p>"Borrow it, then."</p>
               <p>"Impossible! money has not been so scarce for years. Every one is
                  complaining."</p>
               <p>"You'd better make the effort, Mr. Bacon, I shall be sorry to put you to any
                  trouble, but my money will have to be forthcoming."</p>
               <p>"You will not enter up the mortgage?" said the farmer.</p>
               <p>"It will certainly come to that, unless you can pay it."</p>
               <p>"That is what I call oppression!" returned Mr. Bacon, in momentary indignation,
                  for the utterance of which he was as quickly repentant.</p>
               <p>"Good morning," said Dyer, suddenly turning his horse's head, and riding off at a
                  brisk trot.</p>
               <p>For nearly five minutes, old Mr. Bacon stood with his axe resting on the ground,
                  lost in painful thought. Then he went slowly into the house, and sitting down
                  before the fire, let his head sink upon his breast, and there mused on the trouble
                  that was closing around him. But there came no ray of light, piercing the thick
                  darkness that had fallen so suddenly.</p>
               <p>Nothing was then said to his family on the subject, but it was apparent to all
                  that something was wrong, for the lips that gave utterance to so many pleasant
                  words, and parted so often in cheerful smiles, were still silent."</p>
               <p>"Are you not well, to-day?" asked Mrs. Bacon, as the family gathered around the
                  dinner-table, and she remarked her husband's unusually sober face.</p>
               <p>"Not very well," he replied.</p>
               <p>"What ails you, father?" said Mary, with tender concern in her voice, and her eyes
                  were turned upon him with affectionate earnestness.</p>
               <p>"Nothing of much consequence, child," was answered evasively. "I shall be better
                  after dinner."</p>
               <p>And as Mr. Bacon spoke he poured out a larger glass of brandy than usual—he always
                  had brandy on the table at dinner time—and drank it off. This soon took away the
                  keen edge of suffering from his feelings, and he was able to affect a measure of
                  cheerfulness. But he did not deceive the eyes of Mrs. Bacon and Mary.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what ails father!" said Mary, as soon as she was alone with her
                  mother.</p>
               <p>"I don't know," answered Mrs. Bacon, thoughtfully, "he seems troubled about
                  something."</p>
               <p>"I saw that Mr. Dyer, who keeps tavern over in Brookville, talking with father at
                  the wood-pile this morning."</p>
               <p>"You did!" Mrs. Bacon spoke with a new manifestation of interest.</p>
               <p>"Yes; and I thought, as I looked at him out of the window, that he appeared to be
                  angry about something."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bacon did not reply to this remark. Soon after, on meeting her husband, she
                  said to him,</p>
               <p>"What did Mr. Dyer want this morning?"</p>
               <p>"Something that he will not get," replied Mr. Bacon.</p>
               <p>"The money he loaned you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"It's impossible to pay it back now, in the dead of winter," said Mrs. Bacon, in a
                  troubled tone of voice, "he ought to know that."</p>
               <p>"And he does know it."</p>
               <p>"What did you tell him?"</p>
               <p>"That to lift the mortgage now was out of the question."</p>
               <p>"Won't he be troublesome? You remember how he acted towards poor old Mr.
                  Peabody."</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5627-00000010"/>
               <p>"I know he's a hard-hearted, selfish man. I don't believe that there is a spark of
                  humanity about him. But he'll scarcely go to extremities with me. I don't fear
                  that."</p>
               <p>"Did he threaten?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. But I hardly think that he was in earnest."</p>
               <p>How far this last remark of old Mr. Bacon was correct, the following brief
                  conversation will show. It took place between Dyer and a miserable pettyfogging
                  lawyer, in Brookville, named Grant.</p>
               <p>"I've got a mortgage on old Bacon's farm that I wish entered up," said the
                  tavern-keeper, on calling at the lawyer's office.</p>
               <p>"Can't he pay it off?" inquired Grant.</p>
               <p>"Of course not. He's being running down for the last six or seven years, and is
                  now on his last legs."</p>
               <p>"And so you mean to trip him up before he falls of himself." The lawyer spoke in
                  an unfeeling tone and with a sinister smile.</p>
               <p>"If you please to say so," returned Dyer. "I've wanted that farm of his for some
                  time past. When I took the mortgage on it my object was not a simple investment at
                  legal interest; you know that I can do better with money than six per cent a
                  year."</p>
               <p>"I should think you could," responded the lawyer, with a chuckle.</p>
               <p>"When I loaned Bacon three hundred dollars, of course I never expected to get the
                  sum back again. I understood, perfectly well, that sooner or later the mortgage
                  would have to be entered up."</p>
               <p>"And the farm becomes yours for half its real value."</p>
               <p>"Exactly."</p>
               <p>"Are you not striking to soon?" suggested the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Some friend may loan him the amount."</p>
               <p>Dyer shook his head.</p>
               <p>"It's a tight time in Brookville."</p>
               <p>"I know."</p>
               <p>"And still better for my purpose," said Dyer, in a low, meaning, voice; "drunkards
                  have few friends; none, in fact, willing to risk their money on them. Put the
                  screws to Bacon, and his farm will drop into my hands like a ripe cherry."</p>
               <p>"You can hardly call Bacon a drunkard. You never see him staggering about, nor
                  lounging in bar-rooms."</p>
               <p>"Do you remember his farm seven years ago?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly well."</p>
               <p>"Look at it now."</p>
               <p>"There's a great difference, certainly."</p>
               <p>"Isn't there! What's the reason of this?"</p>
               <p>"Intemperance, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Drunkenness!" said the tavern-keeper. "That is the right word. He don't spend
                  much in bar-rooms, but look over his store bill and you'll find rum a large
                  item."</p>
               <p>"Poor Bacon! He's a good sort of a man," remarked the lawyer. "I can't help
                  feeling sorry for him. He's his own worst enemy."</p>
               <p>"I want you to push this matter through in the quickest possible time," said Dyer,
                  in a sharp, firm voice.</p>
               <p>"Very well. It shall be done. I know my business."</p>
               <p>"And I know mine," returned the tavern-keeper.</p>
               <p>On the next day, Mr. Bacon was formally notified that proceedings had been
                  instituted for the satisfaction of the mortgage. This was bringing the threatened
                  evil before his eyes in the most direct aspect. In considerable alarm and
                  perturbation, he called over to see Dyer.</p>
               <p>"You cannot mean to press this matter on to the utmost extremity," said he, on
                  meeting the tavern-keeper, the hard aspect of whose features gave him little room
                  for hope.</p>
               <p>"I certainly mean to get my three hundred dollars," was replied.</p>
               <p>"Can you not wait until after next harvest?"</p>
               <p>"I have already told you that I want my money now," said Dyer, with affected
                  anger. "If you can pay me, well; if not, I will get my own by aid of the
                  Sheriff."</p>
               <p>"That is a hard saying, Mr. Dyer," returned the farmer, in a subdued voice.</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless, it is a true one, friend Bacon, true as gospel."</p>
               <p>"I haven't the money, nor can I borrow it, Mr. Dyer."</p>
               <p>"Your misfortune, not mine. Though I must say, it is a little strange."</p>
               <p>"What is strange?"</p>
               <p>"That a man who has lived in this community as long as you have, can't find a
                  friend willing to loan him three<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5627-00000011"/> hundred
                  dollars to save his farm from the Sheriff. There's something wrong."</p>
               <p>Yes, there was something wrong, and poor old Mr. Bacon felt it now more deeply
                  than ever. Another feeble effort at remonstrance was made, when Mr. Dyer coldly
                  referred him to Grant the lawyer, who had now entire control of the business. But
                  he did not go to him. He felt that to do so would be utterly useless.</p>
               <p>Regular proceedings were entered upon for the settlement of the mortgage, and
                  hurried to an issue as speedily as possible. It was all in vain that Mr. Bacon
                  sought to borrow three hundred dollars, or to find some person willing to take the
                  mortgage on his farm, and let him continue to pay the interest. It was a season
                  when few had money to spare, and those who could have advanced the sum required,
                  hesitated about investing it where there was little hope of getting the amount
                  back again except by execution and sale. For, Mr. Bacon, in consequence of his
                  intemperance, was steadily running behindhand; and all his neighbours knew it.</p>
               <p>The effect of this trouble on the mind of Mr. Bacon was to cause him to drink
                  harder than before. His cheerful temper gave place to a silent moodiness, when in
                  partial states of sobriety, which where now of rare occurrence, and he lost all
                  interest in things around him. A greater part of his time was spent in wandering
                  restlessly about his house or farm, but he put his hand to scarcely any work.</p>
               <p>Deeply distressed were Mrs. Bacon and Mary. Each of them had called, at different
                  times on Mr. Dyer, in the hope of moving him by persuasion to turn from his
                  purpose.</p>
               <p>But, only in one way would he agree to an amicable settlement, and that was, by
                  taking the farm for the mortgage and three hundred dollars cash; by which means he
                  would come into possession of property worth from twelve to fifteen hundred
                  dollars. This offer he repeated to Mary, who was the last to call upon him in the
                  hope of turning him from his purpose.</p>
               <p>"No! Mr. Dyer," said the young girl firmly, even while tears were in her eyes. "My
                  father will not let the place go at a third of its real value."</p>
               <p>"He over-estimates its worth," replied Dyer, with some impatience, "and he'll find
                  this out when it comes under the hammer."</p>
               <p>"You will not, I am sure you will not, sacrifice my father's little place,—the
                  home of his children," said Mary, in an appealing voice.</p>
               <p>"I shall certainly let things take their course," replied the tavern-keeper. "Tell
                  your father, from me, that he has nothing to hope for from any change in my
                  purpose, and that he need make no more efforts to influence me. I will buy the
                  place, as I said, for six hundred dollars, its full value, or I will sell it for
                  my claim."</p>
               <p>And saying this, the man left, abruptly, the room in which his interview with Mary
                  was held, and she, hopeless of making any impression on his feelings, arose and
                  retired from the house, taking, with a sad heart, her way homeward. Never before
                  had Mary, a gentle-hearted, quiet, retiring girl, been forced into such rough
                  contact with the world at any point. Of this act of intercession for her father,
                  Mr. Bacon knew nothing. Had she dropped <choice>
                     <sic>a a</sic>
                     <corr>a</corr>
                  </choice> word of her purpose in his hearing, he would have uttered a positive
                  interdiction. He loved Mary as the apple of his eye, and she loved him with a
                  tender, self-devoted affection. To him, she was a choice and beautiful flower, and
                  even though his mind had become, in a certain degree, degraded and debased by
                  intemperance, there was in it a quick instinct of protection when any thing
                  approached his child.</p>
               <p>Slowly and thoughtfully, with her eyes bent upon the ground, did Mary Bacon pursue
                  her way homeward; and she was not aware of the approach of footsteps behind her,
                  until a man stood by her side and pronounced her name.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Green!" said she, in momentary surprise, pausing as she looked up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green was a farmer in easy circumstances, whose elegant and highly cultivated
                  place was only a short distance from her father's residence. He was, probably, the
                  richest man in the neighbourhood of Brookville; though, exceedingly close in all
                  money matters. Mr. Bacon would have called upon him for aid in his extremity, but
                  for two reasons. One was, Mr. Green's known indisposition to lend money, and the
                  other was the fact that he had several times talked to him about his bad drinking
                  habits; at which liberty he had taken offence, and retorted rather sharply for one
                  of his mild temper.</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5627-00000012"/>
               <p>The colour mounted quickly to Mary's face, as she paused and lifted her eyes to
                  the countenance of Mr. Green. The fact was, she had been thinking about him, and,
                  just at the moment he came to her side, she had fully made up her mind to call
                  upon him before going home.</p>
               <p>"Well Mary," said he, kindly, and he took her hand.</p>
               <p>Mary's lips quivered, but she could not utter a word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green moved on, still holding her hand, and she moved by his side.</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry to hear," said Mr. Green, "that your father is in trouble. I learned it
                  only an hour ago."</p>
               <p>"That is just what I was coming to see you about," replied Mary, with a boldness
                  of speech that surprised even herself.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Then <emph>you</emph> were coming to see me," said Mr. Green, in a voice
                  that was rather encouraging than otherwise.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. But father knows nothing of my purpose."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Well, Mary, what is it you wish to say to me?"</p>
               <p>The young girl's bosom was heaving violently. Some moments passed ere she felt
                  calm enough to proceed. Then she said—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dyer has a mortgage on father's place for three hundred dollars, and is going
                  to sell it."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dyer is a hard man, and your father should not have placed himself in his
                  power," remarked Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>"Unhappily, he is in his power."</p>
               <p>"So it seems. Well, what do you wish me to do in the case?"</p>
               <p>"To lend <emph>me</emph> three hundred dollars," said Mary, promptly. Thus
                  encouraged to speak, she did not hesitate a moment.</p>
               <p>"Lend <emph>you</emph> three hundred dollars! returned Mr. Green, rather surprised
                  at the directness of her request. "For what use?"</p>
               <p>"To pay off this mortgage, of course," replied Mary.</p>
               <p>"But, who will pay me back my money?" inquired Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>"I will," said Mary, confidently. "You! Pray where do you expect to get so much
                  money from?"</p>
               <p>"I expect to earn it," was firmly answered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green paused, and turning towards Mary, looked earnestly into her young face
                  that was lit up with a beautiful enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"Earn it, did you say?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I will earn and pay it back to you, if it takes a lifetime to do it
                  in."</p>
               <p>"How will you earn it, Mary?"</p>
               <p>Mary let her eyes fall to the ground, and stood for a moment or two. Then looking
                  up, she said—</p>
               <p>"I will go to Lowell."</p>
               <p>"To Lowell?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"And work in a factory?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>Mr. Green moved on again, but in silence, and Mary walked with an anxious heart by
                  his side. For the distance of several hundred yards they passed along and not a
                  word was spoken.</p>
               <p>"To Lowell?" at length dropped from the lips of Mr. Green, in a tone half
                  interrogative, half in surprise. Mary did not respond, and the silence continued
                  until they came to a point in the road where their two ways diverged.</p>
               <p>"Have you thought well of this, Mary?" said Mr. Green, as he paused here, and laid
                  his hand upon a gate that opened into a part of his farm.</p>
               <p>"Why should I think about it, Mr. Green?" replied Mary. "It is no time to think,
                  but to act. Hundreds of girls go into factories, and it will be to me no hardship,
                  but a pleasure, if thereby I can help my father in this great extremity."</p>
               <p>"Is he aware of your purpose?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no sir! no!"</p>
               <p>"He would never listen to such a thing."</p>
               <p>"Not for a moment."</p>
               <p>"Then will you be right in doing what he must disapprove?"</p>
               <p>"It is done for his sake. Love for him is my prompter, and that will bear me up
                  even against his displeasure."</p>
               <p>"But he may prevent your going, Mary."</p>
               <p>"Not if you will do as I wish."</p>
               <p>"Speak on."</p>
               <p>"Lend me three hundred dollars on my promise to you<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000013"/> that I will immediately go to Lowell, enter a
                  factory, and remain at work until the whole sum is paid back again from my
                  earnings."</p>
               <p>"Well!"</p>
               <p>"I will then take the money and pay off the mortgage. This will release father
                  from his debt to Mr. Dyer, and bring me in debt to you."</p>
               <p>"I see."</p>
               <p>"Father is an honest and an honourable man."</p>
               <p>"He is, Mary," said Mr. Green. His voice slightly trembled, for he was touched by
                  the words of the gentle girl.</p>
               <p>"He will not be able to pay you the debt in my stead."</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"And, therefore, deeply reluctant as he may be to let me go, he cannot say
                  nay."</p>
               <p>"Walk along with me to my house," said Mr. Green, as he pushed open the gate at
                  which he stood, "I must think about this a little more."</p>
               <p>The result was according to Mary's wishes. Mr. Green was a true friend of Mr.
                  Bacon's, and he saw, or believed that he saw, in his daughter's proposition, the
                  means of his reformation. He, therefore, returned into the village, and going to
                  the office of Grant, satisfied the mortgage on Mr. Bacon's property, and brought
                  all the papers relating thereto away and placed them in Mary's hands.</p>
               <p>"Now," said he, on doing this, "I want your written promise to pay me the three
                  hundred dollars in the way proposed. I will draw up the paper, and you must sign
                  it."</p>
               <p>The paper was accordingly drawn up and signed. It stipulated that Mary was to
                  start for Lowell within three weeks, and that she was to have two years for the
                  full payment of the debt.</p>
               <p>"My brave girl!" said Mr. Green, as he parted with Mary. "No one will be prouder
                  of you than I, if you accomplish the work to which you are about devoting
                  yourself. Happy would I be, had I a daughter with your true heart and noble
                  courage."</p>
               <p>Mary's heart was too full to thank him. But her sweet young face was beaming with
                  gratitude, as she turned away and hurried homeward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bacon was walking uneasily, backwards and forwards</p>
               <p>in the old porch, when Mary entered the little garden gate. She advanced towards
                  him with a bright face, holding out as she did so, a small package of papers.</p>
               <p>"Good news, father!" she exclaimed. "Good news!</p>
               <p>"How? What, child?" eagerly asked the old man, his mind becoming suddenly
                  bewildered.</p>
               <p>"The mortgage is paid, and here is the release!" said Mary, still holding out the
                  package of papers.</p>
               <p>"Paid! Paid, Mary! Who paid it?" returned Mr. Bacon, with the air of a man awaking
                  from a dream.</p>
               <p>"I have paid it, father dear!" answered Mary, in a trembling voice; and she kissed
                  the old man's cheek, and then laid her face down upon his breast.</p>
               <p>"You, Mary?" Where did you get money?"</p>
               <p>"I borrowed it," murmured the happy girl.</p>
               <p>"Mary! Mary! what does this mean?" said the old man, pushing back her face and
                  gazing into it earnestly. "Borrowed the money! Why, who would lend you three
                  hundred dollars? Say, child!"</p>
               <p>"I borrowed it of Mr. Green," replied Mary, and as she said this, she glided past
                  her father and entering into the house, hurried away to her mother. But ere she
                  had time to inform her of what she had done, the father joined them, eager for
                  some further explanations. When, at last, he comprehended the whole matter, he
                  was, for a time like a man stricken down by a heavy blow.</p>
               <p>"Never," said he, in the most solemn manner, "will I consent to this. Mr. Green
                  must take back his money. Let the farm go! It shall not be saved at this
                  price."</p>
               <p>But he soon comprehended that it was too late to recall the act of his daughter.
                  The money had already passed into the hands of Dyer, and the mortgage been
                  cancelled. Still, he was fixed in his purpose that Mary should not leave home to
                  spend two long years of incessant toil in a factory, and immediately called on Mr.
                  Green in order to make with him some different arrangement for the payment of the
                  loan. But, to his surprise and grief, he found that Mr. Green was unyielding in
                  his determination to keep Mary to her contract.</p>
               <p>"Surely! surely! Mr. Green, "urged the distressed father," you will not hold my
                  dear child to this pledge, made under circumstances of so trying a nature? You
                     will<pb n="26-27 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5627-00000014"/> not punish—I say
                     <emph>punish</emph>—a gentle girl like her for loving her father too well."</p>
               <p>"If there is any hardship in the case," replied Mr. Green, calmly, "you are at
                  fault, and not me, Mr. Bacon."</p>
               <p>"Why do you say that?" inquired the old man.</p>
               <p>"For the necessity which drove your child to this act of self-sacrifice, you are
                  responsible."</p>
               <p>"Oh sir! is this a time to wound me with words like these? Why do you turn a
                  seeming act of kindness into the sharpest cruelty?"</p>
               <p>"I speak to you but the words of truth and soberness, Mr. Bacon. These, no man
                  should shrink from hearing. Seven years ago, your farm was the most productive in
                  the neighborhood, and you in easy circumstances. What has produced the sad change
                  now visible to all eyes? What has taken from you the ability to manage your
                  affairs as prosperously as before? What has made it necessary for your child to
                  leave her father's sheltering roof and bury herself for two long years in a
                  factory, in order to save you from total ruin? Go home, Mr. Bacon, and answer
                  these questions to your own heart, and may the pain you now suffer lead you to act
                  more wisely in the future."</p>
               <p>"My daughter shall not go!" exclaimed the old man, passionately.</p>
               <p>"I hold her written pledge to repair to Lowell at the expiration of three weeks,
                  and to repay the loan I made her in two years. Will you compel her to violate her
                  contract?"</p>
               <p>"I will execute another mortgage on my farm and pay you back the loan."</p>
               <p>"Act like a wise man," said Mr. Green. "Let your daughter carry out her noble
                  purpose, and thus relieve you from embarrassment."</p>
               <p>"No, no, Mr. Green! I cannot think of this. Oh, sir! pity me! Do not force my
                  child away! Do not lay so heavy a burden on one so young. Think of her as your own
                  daughter, and do to me as you would yourself wish to be done by."</p>
               <p>But Mr. Green was deaf to all these appeals. He was a man of great firmness of
                  purpose, and not easily turned to the right nor to the left.</p>
               <p>During the next three weeks, Mr. Bacon tried every expedient<figure>
                     <head>STARTING FOR LOWELL.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5627-00000015"/> pedient in his power, short of a total
                  sacrifice of his little property, to raise the money, but in vain. Except for a
                  circumstance new in his life, he would, in his desperation, have accepted Dyer's
                  offer of six hundred dollars for his farm, and thus prevented Mary's departure for
                  Lowell—that circumstance was his perfect sobriety. Not since the day when Mr.
                  Green charged upon him the responsibility of his child's banishment from her
                  father's house, had he tasted a drop of strong drink. His mind was therefore
                  clear, and he was restrained by reason from acts of rashness, by which his
                  condition would be rendered far worse than it was already.</p>
               <p>Bitter indeed were the sufferings of Mr. Bacon, during the quick passage of the
                  three weeks—at the expiration of which time Mary was to leave home, in compliance
                  with her contract—and the more bitter, because his mind was unobscured by drink.
                  At last, the moment of separation came. It was a clear cold morning towards the
                  latter end of March, when Mary left, for the last time, her little chamber, and
                  came down stairs dressed for her journey. Ever, in the presence of her father and
                  mother, during the brief season of preparation, had she maintained a cheerful and
                  confident exterior; but, in her heart, there was a painful shrinking back from the
                  trial upon which she was about entering. On going by the door of Mary's chamber, a
                  few minutes before she came down, Mrs. Bacon saw her daughter kneeling at her
                  bedside, with her face deeply buried among the clothes. Not till that moment did
                  she fully comprehend the trial through which her child was passing.</p>
               <p>The stage was at the door, and Mary's trunk strapped up in the boot before she
                  came down. In the porch stood her father and mother, and her younger brother and
                  sister, waiting her appearance.</p>
               <p>"Good bye, father," said the excellent girl, in a cheerful voice, as she reached
                  out her hand. I</p>
               <p>Mr. Bacon caught it eagerly, and essayed to speak some tender and encouraging
                  words. But though his lips moved, there was no sound upon the air.</p>
               <p>"God bless you!" was at length uttered in a sobbing voice. A fervent kiss was then
                  pressed upon her lips, and the old man turned away and staggered rather than
                  walked back into the house.<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5627-00000016"/> More calmly
                  the mother parted with her child. It was a great trial for Mrs. Bacon, but she now
                  fully comprehended the great use to flow from Mary's self-devotion, and,
                  therefore, with her last kiss, breathed a word of encouragement.</p>
               <p>"It is for your father. Let that sustain you to the end." A few moments more, and
                  the stage rolled away, bearing with it the very sunlight from the dwelling of Mr.
                  Bacon. Poor old man! Restlessly did he wander about for days after Mary's
                  departure, unable to apply himself, except for a little while at a time, to any
                  work; but his inquietude did not drive him back to the cup he had abandoned. No,
                  he saw in it too clearly the cause of his present deep distress, to look upon and
                  feel its allurement. What had banished from her pleasant home that beloved child,
                  and sent her forth among strangers to toil from early morning until the going down
                  of the sun? Could he love the cause of this great evil? No! There was yet enough
                  virtue in his heart to save him. Love for his child was stronger than his depraved
                  love of strong drink. A few more ineffectual efforts were made to turn Mr. Green
                  from his resolution to hold Mary to her contract, and then the humbled father
                  resigned himself to the necessity he could not overcome, and with a clearer mind
                  and a newly awakened purpose, applied himself to the culture of his farm, which,
                  in a few months, had a more thrifty appearance than it had presented for
                  years.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Mary had entered one of the mills at Lowell, and was doing her
                  work there with a brave and cheerful spirit. Some painful trials, to one like her,
                  attended her arrival in the city and entrance upon the duties assumed. But daily
                  the trials grew less, and she toiled on in the fulfilment of her contract with Mr.
                  Green, happy under the ever present consciousness that she had saved her father's
                  property, and kept their homestead as the gathering place of the family. At the
                  end of three months, she came back and spent a week. How her young heart bounded
                  with joy at the great change apparent in every thing about the house and farm,
                  but, most of all, at the change in her father. He was not so light of word and
                  smilingly cheerful as in former times, but he was sober, perfectly sober; and she
                  felt that the kiss with which he welcomed her brief return, was purer than it had
                  ever been.</p>
               <p>On the very day Mary came back, she called over to see Mr. Green, and paid him
                  thirty-seven dollars on account of the loan, for which he gave her a receipt. Then
                  he had many questions to ask about her situation at Lowell, and how she bore her
                  separation from home, to all of which she gave cheerful answers, and, in the end,
                  repeated her thanks for the opportunity he had given her to be of such great
                  service to her father.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green had a son who, during his term at college, exhibited talents of so
                  decided a character that his father, after some deliberation, concluded to place
                  him under the care of an eminent lawyer in Boston. In this position he had now
                  been for two years, and was about applying for admission to the bar. As children,
                  Henry Green and Mary Bacon had been to the same school together, and, as children,
                  they were much attached to each other. Their intercourse, as each grew older, was
                  suspended by the absence of Henry at college, and by other circumstances that
                  removed the two families from intimate contact, and they had ceased to think of
                  each other except when some remembrance of the past brought up their images.</p>
               <p>After paying Mr. Green the amount of money which she had saved from her earnings
                  during the first three months of her factory life, Mary left his house, and was
                  walking along the carriage way leading to the public road, when she saw a young
                  man enter the gate and approach her.</p>
               <p>Although it was three years since she had met Henry Green, she knew him at a
                  glance, but he did not recognize her, although struck with something familiar in
                  her face as he bowed to her in passing.</p>
               <p>"Who can that be?" said he to himself, as he walked thoughtfully along. "I have
                  seen her before. Can that be Mary Bacon? If so, how much she has improved!"</p>
               <p>On meeting his father, the young man asked if he was right in his conjecture about
                  the young person he had just passed, and was answered in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>"She was only a slender girl when I saw her last. Now, she is a handsome young
                  woman," said Henry.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mary has grown up rapidly," replied Mr. Green, evincing no particular
                  interest in the subject of his remark.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5627-00000017"/>
               <p>"How is her father doing now?" asked Henry.</p>
               <p>"Better than he did a short time ago," was replied</p>
               <p>"I'm glad to hear that. Does he drink as much as ever?"</p>
               <p>"No. He has given up that bad habit."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Then he must be doing better."</p>
               <p>"He ran himself down very low," said Mr. Green, "and was about losing every thing,
                  when Mary, like a brave, right-minded girl, stepped forward and saved him."</p>
               <p>"Mary! How did she do that, father?"</p>
               <p>"Dyer had a mortgage of three hundred dollars on his farm, and was going to sell
                  him out in mid-winter, when nobody who cared to befriend him had money to spare.
                  On the very day I heard about his trouble, Mary called on me and asked the loan of
                  a sum sufficient to lift the mortgage.</p>
               <p>"But how could she pay you back that sum?" asked the young man in surprise.</p>
               <p>"I loaned her the amount she asked," replied Mr. Green, "and she has just paid me
                  the first promised instalment of thirty-seven dollars."</p>
               <p>"How did she get the money?"</p>
               <p>"She earned it with her own hands."</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"In Lowell."</p>
               <p>"You surprise me," said Henry. "And so, to save her father from ruin, she has
                  devoted her young life to toil in a factory?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and the effect of this self-devotion has been all that I hoped it would be.
                  It has reformed her father. It has saved him in a double sense."</p>
               <p>"Noble girl!" exclaimed the young man, with enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you may well say that, Henry," replied Mr. Green. "In the heart of that
                  humble factory girl is a truly noble and womanly principle, that elevates her, in
                  my estimation, far above any thing that rank, wealth, or social position alone can
                  possibly give."</p>
               <p>"But father," said Henry, "is it right to subject her to so severe a trial? It
                  will take a long, long time, for her to earn three hundred dollars. Does not
                  virtue like hers—"</p>
               <p>"I know what you would say," interrupted Mr. Green. True I could cancel the
                  obligation and derive great pleasure from doing so, but it is the conclusion of my
                  better judgment, all things considered, that she be permitted to fill up the
                  entire measure of her contract. The trial will fully prove her, and bring to view
                  the genuine gold of her character. Moreover, it is best for her father that she
                  should seem to be a sufferer through his intemperance. I say seem, for, really,
                  Mary experiences more pleasure than pain from what she is doing. The trial is not
                  so great as it appears. Her reward is with her daily, and it is a rich
                  reward."</p>
               <p>Henry asked no further question, but he felt more than a passing interest in what
                  he had heard. In the course of a week, Mary returned to Lowell and he went back to
                  Boston.</p>
               <p>Three months afterwards, Mary again came home to visit her parents, and again
                  called upon Mr. Green to pay over to him what she had been able to save from her
                  earnings. It so happened that Henry Green was on a visit from Boston, and that he
                  met her, as before, as she was retiring from the house of his father. This time he
                  spoke to her and renewed their old acquaintance, even going so far as to walk a
                  portion of the way home with her. At the end of another three months, they met
                  again. Brief though this meeting was, it left upon the mind of each the other's
                  image more strongly impressed than it had ever been. In the circle where Henry
                  Green moved in Boston, he met many educated, refined, and elegant young women,
                  some of whom had attracted him strongly; but, in the humble Mary Bacon, whose
                  station in life was that of a toiling factory girl, he saw a moral beauty whose
                  light threw all the allurements presented by these completely into shadow.</p>
               <p>Six months went by. Henry Green had been admitted to the bar, and was now a
                  practising attorney in Boston. It was in the pleasant month of June and he had
                  come home to spend a few weeks with his family. One morning, a day or two after
                  his return, as he sat conversing with his father, the form of some one darkened
                  the door.</p>
               <p>"Ah Mary!" said the elder Mr. Green rising and taking the hand of Mary Bacon,
                  which he shook warmly. "My son, Henry," he added, presenting the blushing girl<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5627-00000018"/> to his son, who, in turn, took her hand
                  and expressed the pleasure he felt at meeting her. Knowing the business upon which
                  Mary had called, Henry, not wishing to be present at its transaction, soon
                  retired. As he did so, Mary drew out her purse and took therefrom a small roll of
                  bank bills, saying, as she handed it to Mr. Green,</p>
               <p>"I have come to make you another payment."</p>
               <p>With a grave, business-like air, Mr. Green took the money and, after counting it
                  over, went to his secretary and wrote out a receipt.</p>
               <p>"Let me see," said he, thoughtfully, as he came back with the receipt in his hand.
                  "How much does this make? One, two, three, four, five quarterly payments. One
                  hundred and eighty-seven dollars and a half. You'll soon be through, Mary. There
                  is nothing like patience, perseverance, and industry. How is your father this
                  morning?"</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir."</p>
               <p>"I think his health has improved of late."</p>
               <p>"Very much."</p>
               <p>"And so has every thing around him. I was looking at his farm a few days ago, and
                  never saw crops in a finer condition. And how is your health, Mary."</p>
               <p>"Pretty good," was replied, though not with much heartiness of manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green now observed her more closely, and saw that her cheeks were thinner and
                  paler than at her last visit. He did not remark on it, however, and, after a few
                  words more of conversation, Mary arose and withdrew.</p>
               <p>It was, perhaps, an hour afterwards, that Henry said to his father,</p>
               <p>"Mary Bacon doesn't look as well as when I last saw her."</p>
               <p>"So it struck me," returned Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid she has taken upon her more than she has the strength to accomplish.
                  She is certainly paler and thinner than she was, and is far from looking as
                  cheerful and happy as when I saw her six months ago."</p>
               <p>Mr. Green did not reply to this, but his countenance assumed a thoughtful
                  expression.</p>
               <p>"Mary is a good daughter," he at length said, as if speaking to himself.</p>
               <p>"There is not one in a thousand like her," replied Henry, with a warmth of manner
                  that caused Mr. Green to lift his eyes to his son's face.</p>
               <p>"I fully agree with you in that," he answered.</p>
               <p>"Then, father," said Henry, "why hold her any longer to her contract, thus far so
                  honorably fulfilled. The trial has proved her. You see the pure gold of her
                  character."</p>
               <p>"I have long seen it," returned Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>"Her father is thoroughly reformed."</p>
               <p>"So I have reason to believe."'</p>
               <p>"Then act from your own heart's generous impulses, father, and forgive the balance
                  of the debt."</p>
               <p>"Are you certain that she will accept what you ask me to give? Will her own sense
                  of justice permit her to stop until the whole claim is satisfied?" asked Mr.
                  Green.</p>
               <p>"I cannot answer for that father," returned Henry. "But, let me beg of you to at
                  least make the generous offer of a release."</p>
               <p>Mr. Green went to his secretary, and, taking a small piece of paper from a drawer,
                  held it up, and said—</p>
               <p>"This, Henry, is her acknowledgment of the debt to me. If I write upon it
                  'satisfied,' will you take it to her and say, that I hold the obligation no
                  farther."</p>
               <p>"Gladly!" was the instant reply of Henry. "You could not ask me to do a thing from
                  which I would derive greater pleasure."</p>
               <p>Mr. Green took up his pen and wrote across the face of the paper, in large
                  letters, "satisfied," and then, handing it to his son, said—</p>
               <p>"Take it to her, Henry, and say to her, that if I had given way to my feelings, I
                  would have done this a year ago. And now, let me speak a word for your ear. Never
                  again, in this life, may a young woman cross your path, whose character is so
                  deeply grounded in virtue, who is so pure, so unselfish, so devoted in her love,
                  so strong in her good purposes. Her position is humble, but, in a life-companion,
                  we want personal excellences, not extraneous social adjuncts. You have my full
                  consent to win, if you can, this sweet flower, blooming by the way-side. A proud
                  day will it be for me, when I can call her my daughter. I have long loved her as
                  such."</p>
               <p>More welcome words than these Mr. Green could not<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000019"/> have spoken to his son. They were like a response
                  to his own feelings. He did not, however, make any answer, but took the contract
                  in silence and quickly left the room.</p>
               <p>The reader can easily anticipate what followed. Mary did not go back to Lowell. A
                  year afterwards she was introduced to a select circle of friends in Boston as the
                  wife of Henry Green, and she is now the warmly esteemed friend and companion of
                  some of the most intelligent, refined, right-thinking, and right-feeling people in
                  that city. Her husband has seen no reason to repent of his choice.</p>
               <p>As for old Mr. Bacon, his farm has continued to improve in appearance and value
                  ever since his daughter paid off the mortgage; and as he, once for all, banished
                  liquor from his house, he is in no danger of having his little property burdened
                  with a new encumbrance. His cheerfulness has returned, and he bears as of old, the
                  reputation of being the best tempered, best hearted man in the neighborhood.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>TWO PICTURES.</head>
               <p>Two beautiful children, a boy and a girl, the oldest but six years of age, came in
                  from school one evening, later than usual by half an hour. Both their eyes were
                  red with weeping, and their cheeks wet with tears. Their father, Mr. Warren, who
                  had come home from his business earlier than usual, had been waiting some time for
                  their return, and wondering why they stayed so late. They were his only children,
                  and he loved them most tenderly. They had, a few weeks before, been entered at a
                  school kept by a lady in the neighborhood—not so much for what they would learn,
                  as to give occupation to their active minds.</p>
               <p>"Why, Anna! Willy!" exclaimed Mr. Warren, as the children came in, "what's the
                  matter? Why have you stayed so late?"</p>
               <p>Anna lifted her tearful eyes to her father's face, and her lip curled and
                  quivered. But she could not answer his question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Warren took the grieving child in his arms, and as he drew her to his bosom,
                  said to Willy, who was the oldest—</p>
               <p>"What has made you so late, dear?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Roberts kept us in," sobbed Willy.</p>
               <p>"Kept you in!" returned Mr. Warren, in surprise. "How came that?"</p>
               <p>"Because we laughed," answered the child, still sobbing and weeping.</p>
               <p>"What made you laugh?"</p>
               <p>"One of the boys made funny faces."</p>
               <p>"And did you laugh too, dear?" asked the father of Anna.</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa. But I couldn't help it. And Miss Roberts scolded so, and said she was
                  going to whip us."</p>
               <p>"And was that all you did?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, papa," said Willy.</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5627-00000020"/>
               <p>"I'll see Miss Roberts about it," fell angrily from the lips of Mr. Warren. "It's
                  the last time you appear in her school. A cruel-minded woman!"</p>
               <p>And then the father soothed his grieving little ones with affectionate words and
                  caresses.</p>
               <p>"Dear little angels!" said Mr. Warren to his wife, shortly afterwards, "that any
                  one could have the heart to punish them for a sudden outburst of joyous feelings!
                  And Anna in particular, a mere babe as she is, I can't get over it. To think of
                  her being kept in for a long half hour, under punishment, after all the other
                  children had gone home. It was cruel. Miss Roberts shall hear from me on the
                  subject."</p>
               <p>"I don't know, dear, that I would say any thing about it," remarked the mother,
                  who was less excited about the matter, "I don't think she meant to be severe. She,
                  doubtless, forgot that they were so very young."</p>
               <p>"She'd no business to forget it. I've no idea of my children being used after this
                  fashion. The boy that made them laugh should have been kept in, if any punishment
                  had to be inflicted. But it's the way with cruel-minded people. The weakest are
                  always chosen as objects of their dislike."</p>
               <p>"I am sure you take this little matter too much to heart," urged the mother. "Miss
                  Roberts must have order in her school, and even the youngest must conform to this
                  order. I do not think the punishment so severe. She had to do something to make
                  them remember their fault, and restrain their feelings in future; and she could
                  hardly have done less. It is not too young for them to learn obedience in any
                  position where they are introduced."</p>
               <p>But the over fond and tender father could see no reason for the punishment his
                  little ones had received; and would not consent to let them go again to the school
                  of Miss Roberts. To him they were earth's most precious things. They were tender
                  flowers; and he was troubled if ever the winds blew roughly upon them.</p>
               <p>Seven years have passed. Let us visit the home of Mr. Warren and look at him among
                  his children. No; we will not enter this pleasant house—he moved away long ago.
                  Can this be the home of Mr. Warren! Yes. Small, poor, and comfortless as it is!
                  Ah! there have been sad changes. Let us enter. Can that be Warren? That wretched
                  looking creature—with swollen, disfigured face and soiled garments—who sits, half
                  stupid, near the window? A little flaxen-haired child is playing on the floor. It
                  is not Anna. No; seven years have changed her from the fairylike little creature
                  she was when her father became outraged at her punishment in Miss Roberts' school!
                  Poor Anna! That was light as the thistle down to what she has since received from
                  the hands of her father. The child on the floor is beautiful, even in her tattered
                  clothes. She has been playing for some time. Now her father calls to her in a
                  rough, grumbling voice.</p>
               <p>"Kate! You, Kate, I say!"</p>
               <p>Little Kate, not five years old, leaves her play and goes up to where her parent
                  is sitting.</p>
               <p>"Go and get me a drink of water," said he in a harsh tone of authority.</p>
               <p>Kate takes a tin cup from a table and goes to the hydrant in the yard. So pleased
                  is she in seeing the water run, that she forgets her errand. Three or four times
                  she fills the cup, and then pours forth its contents, dipping her tiny feet in the
                  stream that is made. In the midst of her sport, she hears an angry call, and
                  remembering the errand upon which she has been sent, hurriedly fills her cup again
                  and bears it to her father. She is frightened as she comes in and sees his face;
                  this confuses her; her foot catches in something as she approaches, and she falls
                  over, spilling the cup of water on his clothes. Angrily he catches her up, and,
                  cruel in his passion, strikes her three or four heavy blows.</p>
               <p>"Now take that cup and get me some water!" he cries, in a loud voice, "and if you
                  are not here with it in a minute, I'll beat the life half out of you! I'll teach
                  you to mind when your spoken to, I will! There! Off with you!"</p>
               <p>Little Kate, smarting from pain, and trembling with fear, lifts the cup and
                  hurries away to perform her errand. She drops it twice from her unsteady hands ere
                  she is able to convey it, filled with water, to her parent, who takes it with such
                  a threatening look from his eyes, that the child shrinks away from him, and goes
                  from the room in fear.</p>
               <p>An hour passes, and the light of day begins to fade.<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000021"/> Evening comes slowly on, and at length the darkness
                  closes in. But twice since morning has Warren been from the house, and then it was
                  to get something to drink. The door at length opens quietly, and a, little girl
                  enters. Her face is thin and drooping, and wears a look of patient suffering.</p>
               <p>"You're late, Anna," says the mother, kindly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am. We had to stay later for our money. Mr. Davis was away from the
                  store, and I was afraid I would have to come home without it. Here it is."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Warren took the money.</p>
               <p>"Only a dollar!" There was disappointment in her tones as she said this.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am, that is all," replied Anna, in a troubled voice. "I spoiled some
                  work, and Mr. Davis said I should pay for it, and so he took half a dollar from my
                  wages."</p>
               <p>"Spoiled your work!" spoke up the father, who had been listening. "That's more of
                  your abominable carelessness!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, father; I couldn't help it," said Anna, "one of the girls—"</p>
               <p>"Hush up, will you! I want none of your lying excuses. I know you! It was done on
                  purpose, I have not the least doubt."</p>
               <p>Anna caught her breath, like one suddenly deprived of air. Tears rushed to her
                  eyes and commenced falling over her cheeks, while her bosom rose and fell
                  convulsively.</p>
               <p>"Come, now! None of that!" said the cruel father sternly. "Stop your crying
                  instantly, or I will give you something to cry for! A pretty state of things,
                  indeed, when every word must be answered by a fit of crying!"</p>
               <p>The poor child choked down her feelings as best she could, turning as she did so
                  from her father; that he might not see the still remaining traces of her grief
                  which it was impossible at once to hide.</p>
               <p>Not a single dollar had the idle, drunken father earned during the week, that he
                  had not expended in self-indulgence; and yet, in his brutality, he could roughly
                  chide this little girl, yet too young for the taskmaster, because she had lost
                  half a dollar of her week's earnings through an accident, the very nature of which
                  he would not hear explained plained. So grieved was the poor child at this
                  unkindness, that when supper was on the table she shrunk away from the room.</p>
               <p>"Come, Anna, to your supper," called the mother.</p>
               <p>"I don't wish any thing to eat," replied the child, in a faint voice.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; come and get something."</p>
               <p>"Let her alone!" growls the father. "I never humor sulky children. She doesn't
                  deserve any supper."</p>
               <p>The mother sighs. While the husband eats greedily, consuming, himself, more than
                  half that is on the table, she takes but a few mouthfuls, and swallows them with
                  difficulty.</p>
               <p>After supper, Willy, who is just thirteen, and who has already been bound out as
                  an apprentice to a trade, comes home. He has a tale of suffering to tell. For some
                  fault his master has beaten him until the large purple welts lie in meshes across
                  his back from his shoulders to his hips.</p>
               <p>"How comes all this?" asks Mr. Warren. There is not the smallest sign of sympathy
                  in his voice.</p>
               <p>Willy relates the cause, and tells it truly. He was something to blame, but his
                  fault needed not the correction of stripes even lightly applied.</p>
               <p>"Served you right!" said the father, when the story was ended. "No business to
                  have acted so. Do as you are told, and mind your work, and you'll escape flogging.
                  Otherwise, I don't care how often you get it. You've been spoiled at home, and
                  it'll do you good to toe the mark. Did your master know you were coming home
                  to-night?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," replied the boy, with trembling lips, and a choking voice.</p>
               <p>"Then what did you come for? To get pitied? Do right and you'll need no pity."</p>
               <p>"Oh, James, don't speak so to the child!" said Mrs. Warren, unable to keep
                  silence.</p>
               <p>This was answered by an angry look.</p>
               <p>"You must go back to your master, boy," said the father, after a pause. "When you
                  wish to come home, ask his consent."</p>
               <p>"He doesn't object to my coming home," said Willy, his voice still quivering.</p>
               <p>"Go back, I tell you! Take your hat, there, and go back. Don't come here any more
                  with your tales!"</p>
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5627-00000022"/>
               <p>The boy glanced towards his mother, and read pity and sympathy in her countenance,
                  but she did not countermand the order; for she knew that if she did so, a scene of
                  violence would follow.</p>
               <p>"Ask to come home in the morning," said she to her boy, as she held his hand
                  tightly in hers at the door. He gave her a look of tender thankfulness, and then
                  went forth into the darkness, feeling so sad and wretched that he could not
                  repress his tears.</p>

               <head>BRANDY AS A PREVENTIVE.</head>
               <p>THE cholera had made its appearance in New York, and many deaths were occurring
                  daily. Among those who weakly permitted themselves to feel an alarm amounting
                  almost to terror, was a Mr. Hobart, who, from the moment the disease manifested
                  itself, became infested with the idea that he would be one of its victims.</p>
               <p>"Doctor," said he to his family physician, meeting him one day in the street, "is
                  there nothing which a man can take that will act as a preventive to cholera?"</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what I do," replied the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Well, what is it?"</p>
               <p>"I take a glass of good brandy twice a day. One in the morning and the other after
                  dinner."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! And do you think brandy useful in preventing the disease?"</p>
               <p>"I think it a protection," said the doctor. "It keeps the system slightly
                  stimulated; and is, besides, a good astringent."</p>
               <p>"A very simple agent," remarked Mr. Hobart.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the most simple that we can adopt. And what is better, the use of it leaves
                  no after bad consequences, as is too often the case with medicines, which act upon
                  the system as poisons."</p>
               <p>"Sometimes very bad consequences arise from the use of brandy," remarked Mr.
                  Hobart. "I have seen them in my time."</p>
               <p>"Drunkenness, you mean."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"People who are likely to make beasts of themselves had better let it alone," said
                  the doctor, contemptuously. "If they should take the cholera and die, it will be
                  no great loss to the world."</p>
               <p>"And you really think a little good brandy, taken daily, fortifies the system
                  against the cholera?"</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5627-00000023"/>
               <p>"Seriously I do," replied the doctor. "I have adopted this course from the first,
                  and have not been troubled with a symptom of the disease."</p>
               <p>"I feel very nervous on the subject. From the first I have been impressed with the
                  idea that I would get the disease and die."</p>
               <p>"That is a weakness, Mr. Hobart."</p>
               <p>"I know it is, still I cannot help it. And you would advise me to take a little
                  good brandy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, every day."</p>
               <p>"I am a Son of Temperance."</p>
               <p>"No matter; you can take it as medicine under my prescription. I know a dozen Sons
                  of Temperance who have used brandy every day since the disease appeared in New
                  York. It will be no violation of your contract. Life is of too much value to be
                  put in jeopardy on a mere idea."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you there. I'd drink any thing if I thought it would give me an
                  immunity against this dreadful disease."</p>
               <p>"You'll be safer with the brandy than without it."</p>
               <p>"Very well. If you think so, I will use it."</p>
               <p>On parting with the doctor, Mr. Hobart went to a liquor store and ordered half a
                  gallon of brandy sent home. He did not feel altogether right in doing so, for it
                  must be understood, that, in years gone by, Mr. Hobart had fallen into the evil
                  habit of intemperance, which clung to him until he run through a handsome estate
                  and beggared his family. In this low condition he was found by the Sons of
                  Temperance, who induced him to abandon a course whose end was death and
                  destruction, and to come into their Order. From that time all was changed.
                  Sobriety and industry were returned to him in many of the good things of this
                  world which he had lost, and he was still in the upward movement at the time when
                  the fatal pestilence appeared.</p>
               <p>On going home at dinner time, Hobart's wife said to him, with a serious face—</p>
               <p>"A demijohn, with some kind of liquor in it, was sent here to-day."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," he replied, it is brandy that Doctor L—— ordered me to take as a
                  cholera preventive."</p>
               <p>"Brandy!" ejaculated Mrs. Hobart, with an expression of painful surprise in her
                  voice and on her countenance, that rather annoyed her husband.</p>
               <p>"Yes. He says that he takes it every day as a preventive, and directed me to do
                  the same."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't touch it if I were you. Indeed I wouldn't," said Mrs. Hobart,
                  earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Why wouldn't you?"</p>
               <p>"You will violate your contract with the Sons of Temperance."</p>
               <p>"Not at all. Brandy may be used as a medicine under the prescription of a
                  physician. I wouldn't have thought of touching it had not Doctor L—— ordered me to
                  do so."</p>
               <p>"You are not sick, Edward."</p>
               <p>"But there is death in the very air I breathe. At any moment I am liable to be
                  struck down by an arrow sent from an unseen bow, unless a shield be interposed.
                  Such a shield has been placed in my hands. Shall I not use it?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hobart knew her husband well enough to be satisfied that remonstrance and
                  argument would be of no avail, now that his mind was m de up to use the brandy;
                  and yet so distressed did she feel, that she couldn't help saying, with tears in
                  her eyes—</p>
               <p>"<choice>
                     <sic>Eaward</sic>
                     <corr>Edward</corr>
                  </choice>, let me beg of you not to touch it."</p>
               <p>"Would you rather see me in my coffin?" replied Mr. Hobart, with some bitterness.
                  "Death may seem a light thing to you, but it is not so to me."</p>
               <p>"You are not sick," still urged the wife.</p>
               <p>"But I am liable, as I said just now, to take the disease every moment."</p>
               <p>"You will be more liable, with your system stimulated and disturbed by brandy. Let
                  well enough alone. Be thankful for the health you have, and do not invite
                  disease."</p>
               <p>"The doctor ought to know. He understands the matter better than you or I. He
                  recommends brandy as a preventive. He takes it himself."</p>
               <p>"Because he likes it, no doubt."</p>
               <p>"It is silly for you to talk in that way," replied the husband, with much
                  impatience. "He isn't rendered<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5627-00000024"/> more
                  liable to the disease by taking a little pure brandy, for he says that it keeps
                  him perfectly well."</p>
               <p>"A glass of brandy every day may have been his usual custom," urged Mrs. Hobart.
                  "In that case, in its continuance, no change was produced. But your system has
                  been untouched by the fiery liquid for nearly five years, and its sudden
                  introduction must create disturbance. It is reasonable."</p>
               <p>"The doctor ought to know best," was replied to this. "He has prescribed it, and I
                  must take it. Life is too serious a matter to be trifled with. 'An ounce of
                  preventive is worth a pound of cure,' you know."</p>
               <p>"I am in equal danger with yourself," said Mrs. Hobart; "and so are the
                  children."</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly. And I wish you all to use a little brandy."</p>
               <p>"Not a drop of the poison shall pass either my lips or those of the children,"
                  replied Mrs. Hobart, with emphasis.</p>
               <p>"As you please," said the husband, coldly, and turned away.</p>
               <p>"Edward!" Mrs. Hobart laid her hand upon his arm. "Edward! Let me beg of you not
                  to follow this advice."</p>
               <p>"Why will you act so foolishly? Has not the doctor ordered the brandy? I look to
                  him as the earthly agent for the preservation of my health and the saving of my
                  life. If I do not regard his advice, in what am I to trust?"</p>
               <p>"Remember the past, Edward," said the wife, solemnly.</p>
               <p>"I do remember it. But I fear no danger."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hobart turned away sadly, and went up to her chamber to give vent to her
                  feelings alone in tears. Firm to his purpose of using the preventive recommended
                  by the doctor, Mr. Hobart, after dinner, took a draught of brandy and water.
                  Nearly five years, as his wife remarked, had elapsed since a drop of the burning
                  fluid had passed his lips. The taste was not particularly agreeable. Indeed, his
                  stomach rather revolted as the flavor reached his palate.</p>
               <p>"It's vile stuff at best," he remarked to himself, making a wry face. "Fit only
                  for medicine. Not much danger of my ever loving it again. I wish Anna was not so
                  foolish. A flattering opinion she has of her husband!"</p>
               <p>The sober countenance of his wife troubled Mr. Hobart, as he left home for his
                  place of business earlier by half an hour than usual. Neither in mind nor body
                  were his sensations as pleasant as on the day before. The brandy did something
                  more than produce an agreeable warmth in his stomach. A burning sensation soon
                  followed its introduction, accompanied by a feeling of uneasiness that he did not
                  like. In the course of half an hour, this unnatural heat was felt in every part of
                  his body, but more particularly about his head and face; and it was accompanied by
                  a certain confusion of mind that prevented his usual close application to business
                  during the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Towards evening, these disagreeable consequences of the glass of
                  cholera-preventive he had taken in a great measure subsided; but there followed a
                  dryness of the palate, and a desire for some drink more pleasant to the taste than
                  water. In his store was a large pitcher of ice-water; but, though thirsty, he felt
                  no inclination to taste the pure beverage; but, instead, went out and obtained a
                  glass of soda water. This only made the matter worse. The half gill of syrup with
                  which the water was sweetened, created, in a little while, a more uneasy feeling.
                  Still, there was no inclination for the water that stood just at hand, and which
                  he had daily found so refreshing during the hot weather. In fact, when he thought
                  of it, it was with a sense of repulsion.</p>
               <p>In this state, the idea of a cool glass of brandy punch, or a mint julep, came up
                  in his mind, and he felt the draught, in imagination, at his lips.</p>
               <p>"A little brandy twice a day; so the doctor said." This was uttered half
                  aloud.</p>
               <p>Just at the moment a slight pain crossed his stomach. It was the first sensation
                  of the kind he had experienced since the epidemic he so much dreaded had appeared
                  in the city; and it caused a slight shudder to go through his frame, for he was
                  nervous in his fear of cholera.</p>
               <p>"A little mint with the brandy would make it better still. I don't like this
                  feeling. I'll try a glass of brandy and mint." Thus spoke Mr. Hobart to
                  himself.</p>
               <p>Putting on his hat, he went forth for the purpose of<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000025"/> getting some brandy and mint. As he stepped into
                  the street the pain was felt again, and more distinctly. The effect was to cause a
                  slight perspiration to manifest itself on the face and forehead of Mr. Hobart, and
                  to make, in his mind, the necessity for the brandy and mint more imperative. He
                  did not just like to be seen going boldly in at the door of a refectory or
                  drinking-house in a public place, for he was a Son of Temperance, and any one who
                  knew this and happened to see him going in, could not, at the same time, know that
                  he was acting under his physician's advice. So he went off several blocks from the
                  neighborhood in which his store was located, and after winding his way along a
                  narrow, unfrequented street, came to the back entrance of a tavern, where he went
                  in, as he desired, unobserved.</p>
               <p>Years before, Hobart had often stood at the bar where he now found himself. Old,
                  familiar objects and associations brought back old feelings, and he was affected
                  by an inward glow of pleasure.</p>
               <p>"What! you here?" said a man who stood at the bar, with a glass in his hand. He
                  was also a member of the Order.</p>
               <p>"And you here!" replied Mr. Hobart.</p>
               <p>"It isn't for the love of it, I can assure you," remarked the man, as he looked
                  meaningly at his glass. "These are not ordinary times."</p>
               <p>"You are right there," said Hobart. "A little brandy sustains and fortifies the
                  system. That all admit."</p>
               <p>"My physician has ordered it for me. He takes a glass or two every day himself,
                  and tells me that, so far, he has not been troubled with the first symptom."</p>
               <p>"Indeed. That is testimony to the point."</p>
               <p>"So I think."</p>
               <p>"Who is your physician?"</p>
               <p>"Dr. L——."</p>
               <p>"He stands high. I would at any time trust my life in his hands."</p>
               <p>"I am willing to do so." Then turning to the bar-keeper, Mr. Hobart said—"I'll
                  take a glass of brandy and water, and you may add some mint."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you'll have a mint julep?" suggested the bar-keeper keeper, winking aside
                  to a man who stood near, listening to what passed between the two members of the
                  Order.</p>
               <p>"Yes—I don't care—yes. Make it a julep," returned Hobart. "It's the brandy and
                  mint I want. I've had a disagreeable sensation," he added, speaking to the friend
                  he had met, and drawing his hand across his stomach as he spoke, "that I don't
                  altogether like. Here it is again!"</p>
               <p>"A little brandy will help it."</p>
               <p>"I hope so."</p>
               <p>When the mint julep was ready, Hobart took it in his hand and retired to a table
                  in the corner of the room, and the man he had met went with him.</p>
               <p>"Ain't you afraid to tamper with liquor?" asked this person, a little seriously,
                  as he observed the relish with which Hobart sipped the brandy. Some thoughts had
                  occurred to himself that were not very pleasant.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no. Not in the least," replied Mr. Hobart. "I only take it as a medicine,
                  under my physician's order; and I can assure you that the taste is quite as
                  disagreeable as rhubarb would be. I believe the old fondness has altogether died
                  out."</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid it never dies out," said the man, whose eyes told him plainly enough,
                  that it had not died out in the case of the individual before him, notwithstanding
                  his averment on the subject.</p>
               <p>"I feel much better now," said Mr. Hobart, after he had nearly exhausted his
                  glass. "I had such a cold sensation in my stomach, accompanied by a very
                  disagreeable pain. But both are now gone. This brandy and mint have acted like a
                  charm. Dr. L—— understands the matter clearly. It is fortunate that I saw him this
                  morning. I would not have dared to touch brandy, unless under medical advice; and,
                  but for the timely use of it, I might have been dangerously ill with this fatal
                  epidemic."</p>
               <p>After sitting a little while longer, the two men retired through the back entrance
                  to escape observation.</p>
               <p>"How quickly these temperance men seize hold of any excuse to get a glass of
                  brandy," said the bar-keeper to a customer, as soon as Hobart had retired,
                  laughing in a half sneer as he spoke. "They come creeping in through our back way,
                  and all of them have a pain! Ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>"I've taken a glass of brandy and water, every day for<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000026"/> the last five years," replied the man to whom this
                  was addressed, "and I continue it now. But I can tell you what, if I'd been an
                  abstainer, you wouldn't catch me pouring it into my stomach now. Not I! All who do
                  so are more liable to the disease."</p>
               <p>"So I think," said the bar-tender. "But every one to his liking. It puts money in
                  our till. We've done a better business since the cholera broke out, than we've
                  done these three years. If it were to continue for a twelve month we would make a
                  fortune."</p>
               <p>This was concluded with a coarse laugh, and then he went to attend to a new
                  customer for drink.</p>
               <p>For all Mr. Hobart had expressed himself so warmly in favor of brandy, and had
                  avowed his freedom from the old appetite, he did not feel altogether right about
                  the matter. There was a certain pressure upon his feelings that he could not well
                  throw off. When he went home in the evening, he perceived a shadow on the brow of
                  his wife; and the expression of her eyes, when she looked at him, annoyed and
                  troubled him.</p>
               <p>After supper, the uneasiness he had felt during the afternoon, returned, and
                  worried his mind considerably. The fact was, the brandy had already disturbed the
                  well balanced action of the lower viscera. The mucous membrane of the whole <choice>
                     <sic>alementary</sic>
                     <corr>alimentary</corr>
                  </choice> canal had been stimulated beyond health, and its secretions were
                  increased and slightly vitiated. This was the cause of the uneasiness he felt, and
                  the slight pains which had alarmed him. By ten o'clock his feelings had become so
                  disagreeable, that he felt constrained to meet them with another "mouthful," of
                  brandy. Thus, in less than ten hours, Mr. Hobart had wronged his stomach by
                  pouring into it three glasses of brandy; entirely disturbing its healthy
                  action.</p>
               <p>The morning found Mr. Hobart far from feeling well. His skin was dry and feverish
                  and his mouth parched. There was an uneasy sensation of pain in his head.
                  Immediately upon rising he took a strong glass of brandy. That, to use his own
                  words, "brought him up," and made him feel "a hundred per cent better." During the
                  forenoon, however, a slight diarrhœa manifested itself. A thrill of alarm was the
                  consequence.</p>
               <p>"I must check this!" said he, anxiously. And, in order to do so, another and
                  stronger glass of brandy was taken.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon, the diarrhœa appeared again. It was still slight, and
                  unaccompanied by pain. But, it was a symptom not to be disregarded. So brandy was
                  applied as before. In the evening, it showed itself again.</p>
               <p>"I wish you would give me a little of that brandy," said he to his wife. "I'm
                  afraid of this, it must be stopped."</p>
               <p>"Hadn't you better see the doctor?"</p>
               <p>"I don't think it necessary. The brandy will answer every purpose."</p>
               <p>"I have no faith in brandy," said Mrs. Hobart. Poor woman! she had cause for her
                  want of faith!</p>
               <p>"I have then," replied her husband. "It's the doctor's recommendation. And he
                  ought to know."</p>
               <p>"You were perfectly well before you commenced acting on his advice."</p>
               <p>"I was well, apparently. But, it is plain that the seeds of disease were in me.
                  There is no telling how much worse I would have been."</p>
               <p>"Nor how much better. For my part I charge it all on the brandy."</p>
               <p>"That's a silly prejudice," said Mr. Hobart, with a good deal of impatience.
                  "Every one knows that brandy is a remedy in diseases of this kind; not a producing
                  cause."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hobart was silent. But she did not get the brandy. That was more than she
                  could do. So her husband got it himself. But, in order to make the medicinal
                  purpose more apparent, he poured the liquor into a deep plate, added some sugar,
                  and set it on fire.</p>
               <p>"You will not object to burnt brandy at least," said he. "That you know to be
                  good."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hobart did not reply. She felt that it would be useless. Only a disturbance
                  of harmony could arise, and that would produce greater unhappiness. The brandy,
                  after having parted with its more volatile qualities, was introduced into Mr.
                  Hobart's stomach, and fretted that delicate organ for more than an hour.</p>
               <p>"I thought the burnt brandy would be effective," said Mr. Hobart on the next
                  morning. "And it has proved<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5627-00000027"/> so." In order
                  not to lose this good effect, he fortified himself before going out with some of
                  the same article, unburnt. But, alas! By ten o'clock the diarrhœa showed itself
                  again, and in a more decided form.</p>
               <p>Oh dear!" said he in increased alarm. "This won't do. I must see the doctor." And
                  off he started for Doctor L——'s office. But, on the way he could not resist the
                  temptation to stop at a tavern for another glass of brandy, notwithstanding he
                  began to entertain a suspicion as to the true cause of the disturbance. The doctor
                  happened to be in. "I think I'd better have a little medicine, doctor," said he,
                  on seeing his medical adviser. A stitch in time, you know."</p>
               <p>"Ain't you well?"</p>
               <p>"No," and Mr. Hobart gave his symptoms.</p>
               <p>"An opium pill will do all that is required," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Shall I continue the brandy?" asked the patient.</p>
               <p>"Have you taken brandy every day since I saw you?" inquired the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Yes; twice, and sometimes three times."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" The doctor looked thoughtful.</p>
               <p>"Shall I continue to do so?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you had better omit it for the present. You're not in the habit of
                  drinking any thing?"</p>
               <p>"No. I haven't tasted brandy before for five years."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Yes, now, I remember you said so. You'd better omit it until we see the
                  effect of the opium. Sudden changes are not always good in times like these."</p>
               <p>"I don't think the brandy has hurt me," said Mr. Hobart.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not. Still, as a matter of prudence, I would avoid it. Let the opium have
                  a full chance, and all will be right again."</p>
               <p>An opium pill was swallowed, and Mr. Hobart went back to his place of business. It
                  had the intended effect. That is, it cured one disease by producing
                  another—suspended action took the place of over-action. He was, therefore, far
                  from being in a state of health, or free from danger in a cholera atmosphere.
                  There was one part of the doctor's order that Mr. Hobart did not comply with. The
                  free use of brandy for a few days rekindled the old appetite, and. made his desire
                  for liquor so intense, that he had not, or, if he possessed it, did not exercise
                  the power of resistance.</p>
               <p>Sad beyond expression was the heart of Mrs. Hobart, when evening came, and her
                  husband returned home so much under the influence of drink as to show it plainly.
                  She said nothing to him, then, for that she knew would be of no avail. But next
                  morning, as he was rising, she said to him earnestly and almost tearfully.</p>
               <p>"Edward, let me beg of you to reflect before you go further in the way you have
                  entered. You may not be aware of it, but last night you showed so plainly that you
                  had been drinking that I was distressed beyond measure. You know as well as I do,
                  where this will end, if continued. Stop, then, at once, while you have the power
                  to stop. As to preventing disease, it is plain that the use of brandy has not done
                  so in your case; but, rather, acted as a predisposing cause. You were perfectly
                  well before you touched it; you have not been well since. Look at this fact, and,
                  as a wise man, regard its indications."</p>
               <p>Truth was so strong in the words of his wife, that Mr. Hobart did not attempt to
                  gainsay them.</p>
               <p>"I believe you are right," he replied with a good deal of depression apparent in
                  his manner. "I wish the doctor had kept his brandy advice to himself. It has done
                  me no good."</p>
               <p>"It has done you harm," said his wife.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it has. Ah, me! I wish the cholera would subside."</p>
               <p>"I think your fear is too great," returned Mrs. Hobart. "Go on in your usual way;
                  keep your mind calm; be as careful in regard to diet, and you need fear no
                  danger."</p>
               <p>"I wish I'd let the brandy alone!" sighed Mr. Hobart, who felt as he spoke, the
                  desire for another draught.</p>
               <p>"So do I. Doctor L—— must have been mad when he advised it."</p>
               <p>"So I now think. I heard yesterday of two or three members of our Order who have
                  been sick, and every one of them used a little brandy as a preventive."</p>
               <p>"It is bad—bad. Common sense teaches this. No great change of habit is good in a
                  tainted atmosphere. But you see this now, happily, and all will yet be well I
                  trust."</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5627-00000028"/>
               <p>"Yes; I hope so. I shall touch no more of this brandy preventive. To that my mind
                  is fully made up."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hobart felt hopeful when she parted with her husband. But she knew nothing of
                  the real conflict going on in his mind between reason and awakened appetite—else
                  had she trembled and grown faint in spirit. This conflict went on for some hours,
                  when, alas! appetite conquered.</p>
               <p>At dinner time Mrs. Hobart saw at a glance how it was. The whole manner of her
                  husband had changed. His state of depression was gone, and he exhibited an
                  unnatural exhilaration of spirits. She needed not the sickening odor of his breath
                  to tell the fatal secret that he had been unable to control himself.</p>
               <p>It was worse at night. He came home so much beside himself that he could with
                  difficulty walk erectly. Half conscious of his condition, he did not attempt to
                  join the family, but went up stairs and groped his way to bed. Mrs. Hobart did not
                  follow him to his chamber. Heartsick, she retired to another room, and there wept
                  bitterly for more than an hour. She was hopeless. Up from the melancholy past
                  arose images of degradation and suffering too dreadful to contemplate. She felt
                  that she had not strength to suffer again as she had suffered through many, many
                  years. From this state she was aroused by groans from the room where her husband
                  lay. Alarmed by the sounds, she instantly went to him.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" she asked, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"Oh! oh! I am in so much pain!" was groaned half inarticulately.</p>
               <p>"In pain, where?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! oh!" was repeated, in a tone of suffering; and then he commenced
                  vomiting.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hobart placed her hand upon his forehead and found it cold and clammy. Other
                  and more painful symptoms followed. Before the doctor, who was immediately
                  summoned, arrived, his whole system had become prostrate, and was fast sinking
                  into a state of collapse. It was a decided case of cholera.</p>
               <p>"Has he been eating any thing improper?" asked Doctor L——, after administering
                  such remedies, and ordering such treatment as he deemed the case required.</p>
               <p>"Has he eaten no green fruit?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>"Nothing, to my knowledge, replied Mrs. Hobart. "We have been very careful in
                  regard to food."</p>
               <p>"Nor unripe vegetables?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hobart shook her head.</p>
               <p>"Nor fish?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing of the kind."</p>
               <p>"That is strange. He was well a few days ago."</p>
               <p>"Yes, perfectly, until he began to take a little brandy every day as a
                  preventive."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" The doctor looked thoughtful. "But it couldn't have been that. I take a
                  little pure brandy every day, and find it good. I recommend it to all my
                  patients."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hobart sighed. Then she asked—"Do you think him dangerous?"</p>
               <p>"I hope not. The attack is sudden and severe. But much worse cases recover. I will
                  call round again before bed time."</p>
               <p>The doctor went away feeling far from comfortable. Only a few hours before he, had
                  left a man sick with cholera beyond recovery, who had, to his certain knowledge,
                  adopted the brandy-drinking-preventive-system but a week before; and that at his
                  recommendation. And here was another case.</p>
               <p>At eleven o'clock Dr. L—— called to see Mr. Hobart again, and found him rapidly
                  sinking. Not a single symptom had been reached by his treatment. The poor man was
                  in great pain. Every muscle in his body seemed affected by cramps and spasms. His
                  mind, however, was perfectly clear. As the doctor sat feeling his pulse, Hobart
                  said to him—</p>
               <p>"Doctor L——, it is too late!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no. It is never too late," replied the doctor. "Don't think of death; think
                  of life, and that will help to sustain you. You are not, by any means, at the last
                  point. Hundreds, worse than you now are, come safely through. I don't intend to
                  let you slip through my hands."</p>
               <p>"Doctor," said the sick man, speaking in a solemn voice, "I feel that I am beyond
                  the reach of medicine. I shall die. What I now say I do not mean as a reproach.<pb
                     n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5627-00000029"/> I speak it only as a truth right for you
                  to know. Do you see my poor wife?"</p>
               <p>The doctor turned his eyes upon Mrs. Hobart, who stood weeping by the bedside.</p>
               <p>"When she is left a widow, and my children orphans," continued the patient,
                  "remember that you have made them such!"</p>
               <p>"Me! Why do you say that, Mr. Hobart?" The doctor looked startled.</p>
               <p>"Because it is the truth. I was a well man, when you, as my medical adviser,
                  recommended me to drink brandy as a protection against disease. I was in fear of
                  the infection, and followed your prescription. From the moment I took the first
                  draught my body lost its healthy equilibrium; and not only my body, but my mind. I
                  was a reformed man, and the taste inflamed the old appetite. From that time until
                  now I have not been really sober."</p>
               <p>The doctor was distressed and confounded by this declaration. He had feared that
                  such was the case; but now it was charged unequivocally.</p>
               <p>"I am pained at all this," he replied, "In sinning I sinned ignorantly."</p>
               <p>But, ere he could finish his reply, the sick man became suddenly worse, and sunk
                  into a state of insensibility.</p>
               <p>"If it be in human power to save his life," murmured the doctor—"I will save
                  it."</p>
               <p>Through the whole night he remained at the bed-side, giving, with his own hands,
                  all the remedies, and applying every curative means within reach. But, when the
                  day broke, there was little, if any change for the better. He then went home, but
                  returned in a couple of hours.</p>
               <p>"How is your husband?" he asked of the pale-faced wife as he entered. She did not
                  reply, and they went up to the chamber together. A deep silence reigned in the
                  room as they entered.</p>
               <p>"Is he asleep?" whispered the doctor.</p>
               <p>"See!" The wife threw back the sheet.</p>
               <p>"O!" was the only sound that escaped the doctor's lips. It was a prolonged sound,
                  and uttered in a tone of exquisite distress. The white and ghastly face of death
                  was before him.</p>
               <p>"It is your work!" murmured the unhappy woman, half beside herself in her
                  affliction.</p>
               <p>"Madam! do not say that!" ejaculated the physician. "Do not say that!"</p>
               <p>"It is the truth! Did he not charge it upon you with his dying breath?"</p>
               <p>"I did all for the best, madam! all for the best! It was an error in his case. But
                  I meant him no harm."</p>
               <p>"You put poison to his lips, and destroyed him. You have made his wife a widow and
                  his children orphans!"</p>
               <p>"Madam!—"The doctor knit his brows and spoke in a stern voice. But, ere he had
                  uttered a word more, the stricken-hearted woman gave a wild scream and fell upon
                  the floor. Nature had been tried beyond the point of endurance, and reason was
                  saved at the expense of physical prostration.</p>
               <p>A few weeks later, and Doctor L——, in driving past the former residence of Mr.
                  Hobart, saw furniture cars at the door. The family were removing. Death had taken
                  the husband and father, and the poor widow was going forth with her little ones
                  from the old and pleasant home, to gather them around her in a smaller and poorer
                  place. His feelings at the moment none need envy.</p>
               <p>How many, like Mr. Hobart, have died through the insane prescription of brandy as
                  a preventive to cholera! and how many more have fallen back into old habits, and
                  become hopeless drunkards! Brandy is not good for health at any time; how much
                  less so, when the very air we breathe is filled with a subtle poison, awaiting the
                  least disturbance in the human economy to affect it with disease.</p>

               <head>THE TEMPERANCE PLEDGE.</head>
               <p>"I WANT a quarter of a dollar, Jane."</p>
               <p>This was addressed by a miserable creature, bloated and disfigured by
                  intemperance, to a woman, whose thin, pale face, and heart-broken look, told but
                  too plainly that she was the drunkard's wife.</p>
               <p>"Not a quarter of a dollar, John? Surely you will not waste a quarter of a dollar
                  of my hard earnings, when you know that I can scarcely get food and decent clothes
                  for the children?"</p>
               <p>As the wife said this, she looked up into her husband's face with a sad appealing
                  expression.</p>
               <p>"I must have a quarter, Jane," said the man firmly.</p>
               <p>"O, John! remember our little ones. The cold-weather will soon be here, and I have
                  not yet been able to get them shoes. If you will not earn any thing yourself, do
                  not waste the little my hard labor can procure. Will not a sixpence do? Surely
                  that is enough for you to spend for—"</p>
               <p>"Nothing will do but a quarter, Jane, and that I must have, if I steal it!" was
                  the prompt and somewhat earnest reply.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jarvis laid aside her work mechanically and, rising, went to a drawer, and
                  from a cup containing a single dollar in small pieces, her little all, took out a
                  quarter of a dollar, and turning to her husband, said, as she handed it to
                  him—</p>
               <p>"Remember, that you are taking the bread out of your children's mouths!"</p>
               <p>"Not so bad as that, I hope, Jane," said the drunkard, as he clutched the money
                  eagerly; something like a feeble smile flitting across his disfigured and
                  distorted countenance.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and worse!" was the response, made in a sadder tone than that in which the
                  wife had at first spoken.</p>
               <p>"How worse, Jane?"</p>
               <p>"John!" and the wife spoke with a sudden energy, while her countenance lighted up
                  with a strange gleam. "John, I cannot bear this much longer! I feel myself sinking
                  every day. And you—you who pledged yourself—"</p>
               <p>Here the voice of the poor woman gave way, and covering her face with her hands,
                  she bent her head upon her bosom, and sobbed and wept hysterically.</p>
               <p>The drunkard looked at her for a moment, and then turning hurriedly, passed from
                  the room. For some moments after the door had closed upon her husband, did Mrs.
                  Jarvis stand, sobbing and weeping. Then slowly returning to her chair near the
                  window, she resumed her, work, with an expression of countenance that was sad and
                  hopeless.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the poor wretch who had thus reduced his family to a state of
                  painful destitution, after turning away from his door, walked slowly along the
                  street with his head bowed down, as if engaged in, to him, altogether a new
                  employment, that of self-communion. All at once a hand was laid familiarly upon
                  his shoulders, and a well-known voice said—</p>
               <p>"Come, John, let's have a drink."</p>
               <p>"Jarvis looked up with a bewildered air, and the first thing that caught his eye,
                  after it glanced away from the face of one of his drinking cronies, was a sign
                  with bright gold letters, bearing the words, "EAGLE COFFEE-HOUSE." That sign was
                  as familiar to him as the face of one of his children. At the same moment that his
                  eyes rested upon this, creating an involuntary impulse to move towards the
                  tavern-door, his old crony caught hold of his coat-collar and gave him a pull in
                  the same direction. But much to the surprise of the latter, Jarvis resisted this
                  attempt to give his steps a direction that would lead him into his old, accustomed
                  haunt.</p>
               <p>"Won't you drink this morning, Jarvis?" asked the other, with a look of
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>There was evidently a powerful struggle going on in the mind of the drunkard. This
                  lasted only for a moment or two, when he said, loudly, and emphatically—</p>
               <p>"No!"</p>
               <p>And instantly broke from his old boon companion, and hurried on his way.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5627-00000031"/>
               <p>A loud laugh followed him, but he heeded it not. Ten minutes' walk brought him to
                  the store of a respectable tradesman.</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. R—— in?" he asked, as he entered.</p>
               <p>"Back at the desk," was the answer of a clerk.</p>
               <p>And Jarvis walked back with a resolute air.</p>
               <p>"Mr. R——, I want to sign the pledge!"</p>
               <p>"You, Jarvis?" Mr. R—— said, in tones of gratified surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes, me, Mr. R——. It's almost a hopeless case; but here goes to do my best."</p>
               <p>"Are you fully sensible of what you are about doing, Jarvis?"</p>
               <p>"I think I am, Mr. R——. I've drunk nothing since yesterday morning, and with the
                  help of Him above, I am determined never to drink another drop as long as I live!
                  So read me the pledge and let me sign it."</p>
               <p>Mr. R—— turned at once to the constitution of the Washington Temperance Society,
                  and read the pledge thereunto annexed:</p>
               <p>"'We, the undersigned, do pledge ourselves to each other, as gentlemen, that we
                  will not, hereafter, drink any spiritous liquors, wine, malt, or cider, unless in
                  sickness, and under the prescription of a physician.'"</p>
               <p>Jarvis took the pen in his hand, that trembled so he. could scarcely make a
                  straight mark on paper, and enrolled his name among the hundreds of those, who,
                  like him, had resolved to be men once more. This done, he laid down the quarter of
                  a dollar which he had obtained from his wife, the admission fee required of all
                  who joined the society. As he turned from the tradesman's store, his step was
                  firmer and his head more erect, than, in a sober state, he had carried it for many
                  a day.</p>
               <p>From thence he proceeded to a hatter's-shop.</p>
               <p>"Well, Jarvis," was uttered in rather a cool, repulsive tone, as he entered.</p>
               <p>"Are you not in want of a journeyman, Mr. Warren?"</p>
               <p>"I don't want you, Jarvis."</p>
               <p>"If you will give me work, I'll never get drunk again, Mr. Warren."</p>
               <p>"You've said that too many times, Jarvis. The last time you went off when I was
                  hurried with work, and caused me to disappoint a customer, I determined never to
                  have any thing more to do with you."</p>
               <p>"But I'll never disappoint you again," urged the poor man earnestly.</p>
               <p>"It's no use for you to talk to me, Jarvis. You and I are done with each other. I
                  have made up my mind never again to have a man in my shop who drinks rum."</p>
               <p>"But I've joined the temperance society, Mr. Warren."</p>
               <p>"I don't care if you have: in two weeks you'll be lying in the gutter."</p>
               <p>"I'll never drink liquor again if I die!" said Jarvis, solemnly.</p>
               <p>"Look here, you drunken vagabond!" returned the master hatter in angry tones,
                  coming from behind the counter, and standing in front of the individual he was
                  addressing—"if you are not out of this shop in two minutes by the watch, I'll kick
                  you into the street! So there now—take your choice to go out, or be kicked
                  out."</p>
               <p>Jarvis turned sadly away without a reply, and passed out of the door through which
                  he had entered with a heart full of hope, now pained, and almost ready to recede
                  from his earnest resolution and pledge to become a sober man and a better husband
                  and father. He felt utterly discouraged. As he walked slowly along the street, the
                  fumes of a coffee-house which he was passing, unconsciously, struck upon his
                  sense, and immediately came an almost overpowering desire for his accustomed
                  potation. He paused—</p>
               <p>"Now that I try to reform, they turn against me," he sighed bitterly. "It is no
                  use; I am gone past hope!"</p>
               <p>One step was taken towards the tavern-door, when it seemed as if a strong hand
                  held him back.</p>
               <p>"No—no!" he murmured, "I have taken the pledge, and I will stand by it, if I die!"
                  Then moving resolutely onward, he soon found himself near the door of another
                  hatter's-shop. Hope again kindled up in his bosom, and he entered.</p>
               <p>"Don't you want a hand, Mr. Mason?" he asked, in a hesitating tone.</p>
               <p>"Not a drunken one, Jarvis," was the repulsive answer.</p>
               <p>"But I've reformed, Mr. Mason."</p>
               <p>"So I should think from your looks."</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5627-00000032"/>
               <p>"But, indeed, Mr. Mason I have quit drinking, and taken the pledge."</p>
               <p>"To break it in three days. Perhaps three hours."</p>
               <p>"Won't you give me work, Mr. Mason, if I promise to be sober?"</p>
               <p>"No! For I would not give a copper for your promises."</p>
               <p>Poor Jarvis, turned away. When he had placed his hand to the pledge, he dreamed
                  not of these repulses and difficulties. He was a good workman, and he thought that
                  any one of his old employers would be glad to get him back again, so soon as they
                  learned of his having signed the total-abstinence pledge. But he had so often
                  promised amendment, and so often broken his promise and disappointed them, that
                  they had lost all confidence in him; at least, the two to whom he had, thus far,
                  made application.</p>
               <p>After leaving the shop of Mr. Mason, Jarvis seemed altogether irresolute. He would
                  walk on a few steps, and then pause to commune with his troubled and bewildered
                  thoughts.</p>
               <p>"I will try Lankford," said he, at length, half-aloud; "he will give me work,
                  surely."</p>
               <p>A brisk walk of some ten minutes brought him to the door of a small hatter's-shop
                  in a retired street. Behind the counter of this shop stood an old man, busily
                  employed in ironing a hat. There was something benevolent in his countenance and
                  manner. As Jarvis entered, he looked up, and a shade passed quickly over his
                  face.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Mr. Lankford," said Jarvis, bowing, with something like timidity
                  and shame in his manner.</p>
               <p>"Are you not afraid to come here, John?" replied the old man, sternly.</p>
               <p>"I am ashamed to come, but not afraid. You will not harm me, I know."</p>
               <p>"Don't trust to that, John. Did you not steal, ay, that is the word—did you not
                  steal from me the last time I employed you?" The old man was stern and energetic
                  in his manner.</p>
               <p>"I was so wicked as to take a couple of skins, Mr. Lankford, but I did very wrong,
                  and am willing to repay you for them, if you will give me work. I was in liquor
                  when I did it, and, when in liquor, I have no distinct consciousness of the evil
                  of any action."</p>
               <p>"Give you work, indeed! O, no! John; I cannot give you another chance to rob
                  me."</p>
               <p>"But I will not get drunk any more. And you know, Mr. Lankford, that while I was a
                  sober man, and worked for you, I never wronged you out of a sixpence worth."</p>
               <p>"Won't get drunk any more! Ah! John, I have lived too long in. the world, and have
                  seen too much, to heed such promises."</p>
               <p>"But I am in earnest, Mr. Lankford. I signed the pledge this morning."</p>
               <p>"You!" in a tone of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>I</emph> signed it."</p>
               <p>"Ah, John," after a pause, and shaking his head. incredulously, "I cannot credit
                  your word, and I am sorry for it."</p>
               <p>"If I have signed the pledge, and if I am really determined to be a reformed man,
                  will you give me work, Mr. Lankford!"</p>
               <p>The old man thought for a few moments, and then said, half-sorrowfully—</p>
               <p>"I am afraid of you, John. You are such an old offender on the score of
                  drunkenness, that I have no confidence in your power to keep the pledge."</p>
               <p>"Then what <emph>shall</emph> I do!" the poor wretch exclaimed, in tones that made
                  the heart of the old man thrill—for nature and pathos were in them. "Now that I am
                  trying in earnest to do better, no one will give me a word of encouragement, nor a
                  helping hand. Heaven help me!—for I am forsaken of man."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lankford stood thoughtful and irresolute for some moments. At length, he
                  said—</p>
               <p>"John, if you will bring me a certificate from Mr. R——, that you have signed the
                  total-abstinence pledge, I will give you another trial. But if you disappoint me
                  again, you and I are done for ever."</p>
               <p>The countenance of Jarvis brightened up instantly. He turned quickly away, without
                  reply, and hurried off to the store of Mr. R——, the secretary of the society he
                  had joined. The certificate was, of course, obtained.</p>
               <p>"And you have joined, sure enough, John," Mr. Lankford<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000033"/> ford said, in a changed tone, as he glanced over
                  the certificate.</p>
               <p>"Indeed I have, Mr. Lankford."</p>
               <p>"And you seem in earnest."</p>
               <p>"If I was ever in earnest about any thing in my life, I am in earnest now."</p>
               <p>"Keep to your pledge, then, John, and all will be well. While you were a sober
                  man, I preferred you to any journeyman in my shop. Keep sober, and you shall never
                  want a day's work while I am in business."</p>
               <p>The poor man was now shown his place in the shop, and once again he resumed his
                  work, though under a far different impulse than had, for years, nerved him to
                  action.</p>
               <p>Two hours brought his regular dinner-time, when Jarvis, who began to feel the want
                  of food, returned home, with new and strange feelings about his heart. One impulse
                  was to tell his wife what he had done, and what he was doing. But then he
                  remembered how often he had mocked her new springing hopes—how often he had
                  promised amendment, and once even joined a temperance society, only to relapse
                  into a lower and more degraded condition.</p>
               <p>"No, no," he said to himself, after debating the question in his mind, as he
                  walked towards home; "I will not tell her now. I will first present some fruit of
                  my repentance. I will give such an assurance as will create confidence and
                  hope."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jarvis did not raise her eyes to the face of her husband, as he entered. The
                  sight of that once loved countenance, distorted and disfigured, ever made her
                  heart sick when she looked upon it. Jarvis seated himself quietly in a chair, and
                  held out his hands for his youngest child, not over two years old, who had no
                  consciousness of his father's degradation. In a moment the happy little creature
                  was on his knee. But the other children showed no inclination to approach.</p>
               <p>The frugal meal passed in silence and restraint. Mrs. Jarvis felt troubled and
                  oppressed—for the prospect before her seemed to grow more and more gloomy. All the
                  morning she had suffered from a steady pain in her breast, and from a lassitude
                  that she could not overcome. Her pale, thin, care-worn face, told a sad tale of
                  suffering, privation, confinement, and want of exercise. What was to become of her
                  children she knew not. Under such feelings of hopelessness, to have one sitting by
                  her side, who could take much of her burdens from her, were he but to will it—who
                  could call back the light to her heart, if only true to his promise, made in
                  earlier and happier years—soured in some degree her feelings, and obscured her
                  perceptions. She did not note that some change had passed upon him; a change that
                  if marked, would have caused her heart to leap in her bosom.</p>
               <p>As soon as Jarvis had risen from the table, he took his hat, and kissing his
                  youngest child, the only one there who seemed to regard him, passed quickly from
                  the house. As the door closed after him, his wife heaved a long sigh, and then
                  rising, mechanically, proceeded to clear up the table. Of how many crushed
                  affections and disappointed hopes, did that one deep, tremulous sigh, speak!</p>
               <p>Jarvis returned to his work, and applied himself steadily during the whole
                  afternoon. Whenever a desire for liquor returned upon him, he quenched it in a
                  copious draught of water, and thus kept himself as free from temptation as
                  possible. At night he returned, when the same troubled and uneasy silence pervaded
                  the little family at the supper-table. The meal was scanty, for Mrs. Jarvis's
                  incessant labor could procure but a poor supply of food. After the children had
                  been put to bed, Mrs. Jarvis sat down, as usual, to spend the evening, tired as
                  she was, and much as her breast pained her, in sewing. A deep sigh heaved
                  involuntarily her bosom as she did so. It caught the ear of her husband, and smote
                  upon his heart. He knew that her health was feeble, and that constant labor
                  fatigued her excessively.</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't sew to-night, Jane," he said. "You look tired. Rest for one
                  evening."</p>
               <p>Mrs Jarvis neither looked up nor replied. There was something in the tone of her
                  husband's voice that stirred her feelings;—something that softened her heart
                  towards him. But she dared not trust herself to speak, nor to let her eye meet
                  his. She did not wish to utter a harsh nor repulsive word, nor was she willing to
                  speak kindly to him, for she did not feel kindly,—and kind words and affected
                  cheerfulness, she had already found but encouraged him in his evil ways. And so
                  she continued to ply<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5627-00000034"/> her needle, without
                  appearing to regard his presence. Her husband did not make another effort to
                  induce her to suspend her labors; for, under existing circumstances, he was
                  particularly desirous of not provoking her to use towards him the language of
                  rebuke and censure. After sitting silent, for, perhaps half an hour, he rose from
                  his chair, and walked three or four times backwards and forwards across the room,
                  preparatory to going out to seek a coffee-house, and there spend his evening, as
                  his wife supposed. But much to her surprise, he retired to their chamber, in the
                  adjoining room. While still under the expectation of seeing him return, his loud
                  breathing caught her quick ear. He was asleep!</p>
               <p>Catching up the light, as she arose suddenly to her feet, she passed, with a hasty
                  step, into the chamber. He had undressed himself, was in bed, and sound asleep.
                  She held the candle close to his face; it was calmer than usual, and somewhat
                  paler. As she bent over him, his breath came full in her face. It was not loaded
                  with the disgusting fumes that had so often sickened her. Her heart beat
                  quicker—the moisture dimmed her eye—her whole frame trembled. Then looking
                  upwards, she uttered a single prayer for her husband, and, gliding quietly from
                  the room, sat down by her little table and again bent over her work. Now she
                  remembered that he had said, with something unusual in his tones—"I would not sew
                  to-night, Jane; you look tired; rest for one evening"—and her heart was agitated
                  with a new hope; but that hope, like the dove from the ark, found nothing upon
                  which to rest, and trembled back again into a feeling of despondency.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, the unsteady hand of Jarvis, as he lifted his saucer to his
                  lips at the breakfast-table, made his wife's heart sink again in her bosom. She
                  had felt a hope, almost unconsciously. She remembered that at supper-time his hand
                  was firm—now it was unnerved. This was conclusive to her mind, that,
                  notwithstanding his appearance, he had been drinking. But few words passed during
                  the meal, for neither felt much inclined to converse.</p>
               <p>After breakfast, Jarvis returned to the shop and worked steadily until
                  dinner-time, and then again until evening. As on the night before, he did not go
                  out, but retired early to bed. And this was continued all the week. But the whole
                  was a mystery to his poor wife, who dared not even to hope for any real change for
                  the better. On Saturday, towards night, he laid by his work, put on his coat and
                  hat, and went into the front shop.</p>
               <p>"So you have really worked a week, a sober man, John?" Mr. Lankford said.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I have. Since last Sunday morning, no kind of intoxicating liquor has
                  passed my lips."</p>
               <p>"How much have you earned this week, John?"</p>
               <p>"Here is the foreman's account of my work, sir. It comes to twelve dollars."</p>
               <p>"Still a fast workman. You will yet recover yourself, and your family will again
                  be happy, if you persevere."</p>
               <p>"O, sir, they shall be happy! I <emph>will</emph> persevere!"</p>
               <p>Another pause ensued, and then Jarvis said, while the color mounted to his
                  cheek—</p>
               <p>"If you are willing, Mr. Lankford, I should like you to deduct only one-half of
                  what I owe you for those furs I took from you, from this week's wages. My family
                  are in want of a good many things; and I am particularly desirous of buying a
                  barrel of flour to-night."</p>
               <p>"Say nothing of that, John. Let it be forgotten with your past misdeeds. Here are
                  your wages—twelve dollars—and if it gives you as much pleasure to receive, as it
                  does me to pay them, then you feel no ordinary degree of satisfaction."</p>
               <p>Mr. Jarvis received the large sum for him to possess, and hurried away to a
                  grocery. Here he bought, for six dollars, a barrel of flour, and expended two
                  dollars more of his wages in sugar, coffee, tea, molasses, &amp;c. Near to the
                  store was the market-house. Thence he repaired, and bought meat and various kinds
                  of vegetables, with butter, &amp;c. These he carried to the store, and gave
                  directions to have all sent home to him. He had now two dollars left out of the
                  twelve he had earned since Monday morning, and with these in his pocket, he
                  returned home. As he drew near the house, his heart fluttered in anticipation of
                  the delightful change that would pass upon all beneath its humble roof. He had
                  never in his life, experienced feelings of such real joy.</p>
               <p>A few moments brought him to the door, and he went in with the quick step that had
                  marked his entrance for several<pb n="68 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000035"/> days. It was not quite dark, and his wife sat
                  sewing by the window. She was finishing a pair of pantaloons that had to go home
                  that very evening, and with the money she was to get for them she expected to buy
                  the Sunday dinner. There was barely enough food in the house for supper; and
                  unless she received her pay for this piece of work, she had no means of getting
                  the required sustenance for herself and children—or rather, for her husband,
                  herself and children. The individual for whom it was intended was not a prompt
                  pay-master, and usually grumbled whenever Mrs. Jarvis asked him for money. To add
                  to the circumstances of concern and trouble of mind, she felt almost ready to give
                  up, from the excessive pain in her breast, and the weakness of her whole frame. As
                  her husband came in, she turned upon him an anxious and troubled countenance; and
                  then bent down over her work and plied her needle hurriedly. As the twilight fell
                  dimly around, she drew nearer and nearer to the window, and at last stood up, and
                  leaned close up to the panes of glass, so that her hand almost touched them, in
                  order to catch the few feeble rays of light that were still visible. But she could
                  not finish the garment upon which she wrought, by the light of day. A candle was
                  now lit, and she took her place by the table, not so much as glancing towards her
                  husband, who had seated himself in a chair, with his youngest child on his knee.
                  Half an hour passed in silence, and then Mrs. Jarvis rose up, having taken the
                  last stitch in the garment she was making, and passed into the adjoining chamber.
                  In a few minutes she came out, with her bonnet and shawl on, and the pair of
                  pantaloons that she had just finished on her arm.</p>
               <p>"Where are you going, Jane?" her husband asked, in a tone of surprise, that seemed
                  mingled with disappointment.</p>
               <p>"I am going to carry home my work."</p>
               <p>"But I wouldn't go now, Jane. Wait until after supper."</p>
               <p>"No, John. I cannot wait until after supper. The work will be wanted. It should
                  have been home two hours ago."</p>
               <p>And she glided from the room.</p>
               <p>A walk of a few minutes brought her to the door of a<figure>
                     <head>FIRST-FRUITS OF THE PLEDGE.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="-69" xml:id="VAC5627-00000036"/> tailor's-shop, around the front of which
                  hung sundry garments exposed for sale. This shop she entered, and presented the
                  pair of pantaloons to a man who stood behind the counter. His face relaxed not a
                  muscle as he took them and made a careful examination of the work.</p>
               <p>"They'll do," he at length said, tossing them aside, and resuming his employment
                  of cutting out a garment.</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Jarvis paused, dreading to utter her request. But necessity conquered
                  the painful reluctance, and she said—</p>
               <p>"Can you pay me for this pair to-night, Mr. Willets?"</p>
               <p>"No. I've got more money to pay on Monday than I know where to get, and cannot let
                  a cent go out."</p>
               <p>"But, Mr. Willets, I—"</p>
               <p>"I don't want to hear any of your reasons, Mrs. Jarvis. You can't have the money
                  to-night."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jarvis moved slowly away, and had nearly reached the door, when a thought of
                  her children caused her to pause.</p>
               <p>"I cannot go, Mr. Willets, without the money," she said, suddenly turning, and
                  speaking in an excited tone.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>will</emph> go, I'm thinking, madam," was the cool reply.</p>
               <p>"O, sir," changing her tone, "pay me what you owe me; I want it very much."</p>
               <p>"O, yes. So you all say. But I am used to such make-believes. You get no money out
                  of me to-night, madam. That's a settled point. I'm angry now—so you had better go
                  home at once; if you don't, I'll never give you a stitch of work, so help—"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jarvis did not pause to hear the concluding words of the sentence.</p>
               <p>"What <emph>shall</emph> I do?" was the almost despairing question that she asked
                  of herself, as she hurried towards her home. On entering the house she made no
                  remark, for there was no one to whom she could tell her troubles and
                  disappointment, with even the most feeble hope of a word of comfort.</p>
               <p>"Does Mr. Jarvis live here?" asked a rough voice at the door.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," was the reply.</p>
               <pb n="70-73" xml:id="VAC5627-00000037"/>
               <p>"Well, here is a barrel of flour and some groceries for him."</p>
               <p>"There must be some mistake, sir."</p>
               <p>"Is not this Mr. Jarvis's?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And number 40?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then this is the place, for that was the direction given me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, this is the place—bring them in," spoke up Jarvis, in an animated tone.</p>
               <p>The drayman, of course, obeyed. First he rolled in the barrel of flour; then came
                  a number of packages, evidently containing groceries; and, finally, one or two
                  pieces of meat, and sundry lots of vegetables.</p>
               <p>"How much is to pay?" asked Jarvis.</p>
               <p>"Twenty-five cents, sir," responded the drayman, bowing.</p>
               <p>The twenty-five cent piece was taken from his pocket with quite an air, and handed
                  over. Then the drayman went out and that little family were alone again. During
                  the passage of the scene just described, the wife stood looking on with a stupid
                  and bewildered air. When the drayman had departed, she turned to her husband, and
                  said—</p>
               <p>"'John, where did these things come from?"</p>
               <p>"I bought them, Jane."</p>
               <p>"You bought them?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I bought them."</p>
               <p>"And pray, John, what did you buy them with?"</p>
               <p>"With the quarter of a dollar you gave me on Monday."</p>
               <p>"John!"</p>
               <p>"It is true, Jane. With that quarter I went and joined the Washington
                  Total-Abstinence Society, and then went to work at Mr. Lankford's. Here is the
                  result of one week's work, besides this silver," handing her all that remained,
                  after making the purchases.</p>
               <p>"O, John, John," the wife exclaimed, bursting into tears, "do not again mock my
                  hopes. I cannot bear much more."</p>
               <p>"In the strength of Him, Jane, who has promised to help us when we call upon Him,
                  "I will not disappoint the hopes I now revive," said Jarvis, slowly and
                  solemnly.</p>
               <p>The almost heart-broken wife and mother leaned her head upon the shoulder of her
                  husband, and clung to his side with a newly-revived confidence, that she felt
                  would not be disappointed, while the tears poured from her eyes like rain. But her
                  true feelings we cannot attempt to describe—nor dare we venture to sketch further
                  the scene we have introduced. The reader's imagination can do it more justice, and
                  to him we leave that pleasing task, with only the remark, that Mrs. Jarvis's
                  newly-awakened joys and hopes have not again been disappointed.</p>

               <head>TIME, FAITH, ENERGY.</head>
               <p>"I DON'T see that I am so much better off," said Mr. Gordon, a man who had
                  recently given up drinking. "I lost my situation on the very day I signed the
                  pledge, and have had no regular employment since."</p>
               <p>"But you would have lost your situation if you hadn't signed the pledge, I
                  presume," said the individual to whom he was complaining.</p>
               <p>"Yes. I lost it because I got drunk and spoiled my job. But to hear some
                  temperance people talk, one who didn't know would be led to believe that, the very
                  moment the pledge was signed, gold could be picked up in the streets. I must
                  confess that I haven't found it so. Money is scarcer with me than it ever was; and
                  though I don't spend a cent for myself, my family haven't a single comfort more
                  than they had before."</p>
               <p>"Though there's no disputing the fact that they would have many less comforts if
                  you hadn't signed the pledge?"</p>
               <p>"No, I suppose not. But I cannot help feeling discouraged at the way things go. If
                  I had the same wages I received before I signed the pledge, I could be laying up
                  money. But, as it is, it requires the utmost economy to keep from getting in
                  debt."</p>
               <p>"Still, you do manage to keep even?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"On about half your former income?"</p>
               <p>"A little over half. I used to get ten dollars a week. Now I manage, by picking up
                  odd jobs here and there, to make about six."</p>
               <p>"Then you are better off than you were before."</p>
               <p>"I hardly see how you can make that out."</p>
               <p>"Your family have enough to live upon—all they had before—and you have a healthier
                  body, a calmer mind, and a clearer conscience. Isn't here something gained?"</p>
               <p>"I rather think there is," replied Gordon, smiling.</p>
               <p>"And I rather think you are a good deal better off than you were before. Isn't
                  your wife happier?"</p>
               <p>"O! yes. She's as cheerful as a lark all the day."</p>
               <p>"And doesn't murmur because of your light wages?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed! not she. I believe if I didn't earn more than three dollars a week,
                  and kept sober, she would make it do, somehow or other, and keep a good heart.
                  It's wonderful how much she is changed!"</p>
               <p>"And yet you are no better off? Ain't you better off in having a happy wife and a
                  pleasant home, what I am sure you hadn't before?"</p>
               <p>"You are right in that. I certainly had neither of them before. Oh! yes. I am much
                  better off all around. I only felt a little despondent, because I can't get
                  regular employment as I used to, and good wages; for now, if I had these, I could
                  do so well."</p>
               <p>"Be patient, friend Gordon; time will make all right. There are three words that
                  every reformed man should write on the walls of his chamber, that he may see them
                  every morning. They are 'Time, Faith, Energy.' No matter how low he may have
                  fallen; no matter how discouraging all things around him may appear; let him have
                  energy, and faith in time, and all will come out well at last."</p>
               <p>Gordon went home, feeling in better heart than when he met the temperance friend
                  who had spoken to him these encouraging words.</p>
               <p>Henry Gordon, when he married, had just commenced business for himself, and went
                  on for several years doing very well. He laid by enough money to purchase himself
                  a snug little house, and was in a good way for accumulating a comfortable
                  property, when the habit of dram-drinking, which he had indulged for years, became
                  an over-mastering passion. From that period he neglected his business, which
                  steadily declined. In half the time it took to accumulate the property he
                  possessed, all disappeared—his business was broken up, and he compelled to work at
                  his trade as a journeyman to support his family. From a third to a half of the sum
                  he earned weekly, he spent in gratifying the debasing appetite that had almost
                  beggared his family and reduced him to a state of degradation little above that of
                  the brute. The balance was given to his<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5627-00000039"/>
                  sad-hearted wife, to get food for the hungry, half-clothed children.</p>
               <p>Nor was this all. Debts were contracted which Gordon was unable to pay. One or two
                  of his creditors, more exacting than the rest, seized upon his furniture and sold
                  it to satisfy their claims, leaving to the distressed family only the few articles
                  exempt by law.</p>
               <p>Things had reached this low condition, when Gordon came home from the shop, one
                  day, some hours earlier than usual. Surprised at seeing him, his wife said—</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, Henry? Are you sick?"</p>
               <p>"No!" he replied, sullenly, "I'm discharged."</p>
               <p>"Discharged! For what, Henry?"</p>
               <p>"For spoiling a job."</p>
               <p>"How did that happen?" Mrs. Gordon spoke kindly, although she felt anxious and
                  distressed.</p>
               <p>"How has all my trouble happened?" asked Gordon, with unusual bitterness of tone.
                  "I took a glass too much, and—and—"</p>
               <p>"It made you spoil your job," said his wife, her voice still kind.</p>
               <p>"Yes. Curse the day I ever saw a drop of liquor! It has been the cause of all my
                  misfortunes."</p>
               <p>"Why not abandon its use at once and for ever, Henry?"</p>
               <p>"That is not so easily done."</p>
               <p>"Hundreds have done it, and are doing it daily, and so may you. Only make the
                  resolution, Henry. Only determine to break these fetters, and you are free. Let
                  the time past, wherein you have wrought folly, and your family suffered more than
                  words can express, suffice. Only will it, and there will be a bright future for
                  all of us."</p>
               <p>Tears came into the eyes of Mrs. Gordon while she made this appeal, although she
                  strove hard to appear calm. Her husband felt a better spirit awaking within him.
                  There was a brief struggle between appetite and the good resolution that was
                  forming in his mind, and then the latter conquered.</p>
               <p>"I will be free!" he said, turning towards the door through which he had a little
                  while before entered, and hurriedly leaving the house.</p>
               <p>The hour that passed from the time her husband went out until he returned, was one
                  of most anxious suspense to Mrs. Gordon. Her hand trembled so that she could not
                  hold her needle, and was obliged to lay aside the sewing upon which she was
                  engaged, and go about some household employments.</p>
               <p>"Mary, I have signed the pledge, if that will do any good," said Gordon, opening
                  the door and coming in upon his wife with his pledge in his hand. "There," and he
                  unrolled the paper and pointed to his name; "there is my signature, and here is
                  the document."</p>
               <p>He did not speak very cheerfully; but his wife's face was lit up with a sudden
                  brightness, followed by a gush of tears.</p>
               <p>"Do any good!" she replied, leaning her head upon his shoulder, and grasping one
                  of his hands tightly in both of hers. "It will do all good!"</p>
               <p>"But I have no work, Mary. I was discharged to-day, and it is the only shop in
                  town. What are we to do?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Evenly will take you back, now that you have signed the pledge."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he will!" Gordon spoke more cheerfully. "I will go and see him
                  to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gordon prepared her husband a strong cup of coffee, and baked some nice hot
                  cakes for his supper. She combed her hair, and made herself as tidy as possible.
                  The children, too, were much improved in their looks by a little attention, which
                  their mother felt encouraged to give. There was an air of comfort about the
                  ill-furnished dwelling of Henry Gordon that it had not known for a long time, and
                  he felt it.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, after breakfast, Gordon went back to the shop from which he
                  had been discharged only the day previous. Evenly, the owner of it, was a rough,
                  unfeeling man, and had kept Gordon on, month after month, because he could not
                  well do without him. But, on the very day he discharged him, a man from another
                  town had applied for work, and the spoiled job was made an excuse for discharging
                  a journeyman, whose habits of intoxication had always been offensive to the
                  master-workman.</p>
               <p>When Gordon entered the shop for the purpose of asking to be taken back, he met
                  Evenly near the door, who said to him, in a rough manner—</p>
               <p>"And what do you want, pray?"</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5627-00000040"/>
               <p>"I want you to take me back again," replied Gordon. "I have signed the pledge, and
                  intend leading a sober life hereafter."</p>
               <p>"The devil you have!"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir. I signed it yesterday, after you discharged me."</p>
               <p>"How long do you expect to keep it?" asked Evenly, with a sneer. "Long enough to
                  reach the next grogshop?"</p>
               <p>"I have taken the pledge for life, I trust," returned the workman, seriously. He
                  was hurt at the contemptuous manner of his old employer, but his dependent
                  condition made him conceal his feelings. "You will have no more trouble with
                  me."</p>
               <p>"No, I am aware of that. I will have no more trouble with you, for I never intend
                  to let you come ten feet inside the front door of my shop."</p>
               <p>"But I have reformed my bad habit, Mr. Evenly. I will give you no more trouble
                  with my drinking," said the poor man, alarmed at this language.</p>
               <p>"It's no use for you to talk to me, Gordon," replied Evenly, in a rough manner.
                  "I've long wanted to get rid of you, and I have finally succeeded. Your place is
                  filled. So there is no more to say on that subject. Good morning."</p>
               <p>And the man turned on his heel and left Gordon standing half stupified at what he
                  had heard.</p>
               <p>"Rum's done the business for you at last, my lark! I told you it would come to
                  this!" said an old fellow workman, who heard what passed between Gordon and the
                  employer. He spoke in a light, insulting voice.</p>
               <p>Without replying, the unhappy man left the shop, feeling more wretched than he had
                  ever felt in his life.</p>
               <p>"And thus I am met at my first effort to reform!" he murmured, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Hallo, Gordon! Where are you going?" cried a voice as these words fell from his
                  lips.</p>
               <p>He looked up and found himself opposite to the door of one of his old haunts. It
                  was the keeper of it who had called him.</p>
               <p>"Come! Walk in and let us see your pleasant face this morning. Where were you last
                  night? My company all complained about your absence. We were as dull as a
                  funeral."</p>
               <p>"Curse you and your company too!" ejaculated Gordon between his teeth, and moved
                  on, letting his eyes fall again to the pavement.</p>
               <p>"Hey-day! What's the matter?"</p>
               <p>But Gordon did not stop to bandy words with one of the men who had helped to ruin
                  him.</p>
               <p>"It's all over with us, Mary. Evenly's got a man in my place," said Gordon, as he
                  entered his house and threw himself despairingly into a chair. "But won't he give
                  you work, too?" asked Mrs. Gordon, in a husky voice.</p>
               <p>"No! He insulted me, and said I should never come ten feet inside of his
                  shop."</p>
               <p>"Did you tell him that you had signed the pledge?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. But it was no use. He did not seem to care for me any more than he did for a
                  dog."</p>
               <p>The poor man's distress was so great that he covered his face with his hands, and
                  sat swinging his body to and fro, and uttering half-suppressed moans.</p>
               <p>"What are we to do, Mary? There is no other shop in town," he said, looking up,
                  after growing a little calm. "Doesn't it seem hard, just as I am trying to do
                  right?"</p>
               <p>"Don't despair, Henry. Let us trust in Providence. It is only a dark moment; yet,
                  dark as it is, it is brighter to me than any period has been for years. A clear
                  head and ready hands will not go long unemployed. I do not despond, dear husband,
                  neither should you. Keep fast anchored to your pledge, and we will outride the
                  storm."</p>
               <p>"But we shall starve, Mary. We cannot live upon air."</p>
               <p>"No," replied Mrs. Gordon; "but we can live upon half what you have been earning
                  at your trade, and quite as comfortably as we have been living. And it will be an
                  extreme case, I think, if you can't get employment at five dollars a week, doing
                  something or other. Don't you?"</p>
               <p>"It appears so. Certainly I ought to be able to earn five dollars a week, if it is
                  at sawing wood. I'll do that—I'll do any thing."</p>
               <p>"Then we needn't be alarmed. I'll try and get some sewing at any rate, to help
                  out. So brighten up, Henry. All will be well. It will take a little time to get
                     things<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5627-00000041"/> going right again; but time and
                  industry will do all for us that we could ask."</p>
               <p>Thus encouraged, Gordon started out to see if he could find something to do. It
                  was a new thing for him to go in search of work; and rather hard, he felt, to be
                  obliged almost to beg for it. Where to go, or to whom to apply, he did not know.
                  After wandering about for several hours, and making several applications at out of
                  the way places with no success, he turned his steps homeward, feeling utterly cast
                  down. In this state, he was assailed by the temptation to drown all his trouble in
                  the cup of confusion, and nearly drawn aside; but a thought of his wife, and the
                  bright hope that had sprung up in her heart in the midst of darkness, held him
                  back.</p>
               <p>"It's no use to try, Mary," he said, despondingly, as he entered his
                  poorly-furnished abode, and found his wife busy with her needle. "I can't get any
                  work."</p>
               <p>"I have been more successful than you have, Henry," Mrs. Gordon returned, speaking
                  cheerfully. "I went to see if Mrs. Hewitt hadn't some sewing to give out, and she
                  gave me a dozen shirts to make. So don't be discouraged. You can afford to wait
                  for work even for two or three weeks, if it doesn't come sooner. Let us be
                  thankful for what we have to-day, and trust in God for to-morrow. Depend upon it,
                  we shall not want. Providence never forsakes the man who is trying to do
                  right."</p>
               <p>Thus Mrs. Gordon strove to keep up the spirits of her husband. After dinner, he
                  went out again and called to see a well-known temperance man. After relating to
                  him what he had done, and how unhappily he was situated in regard to work, the man
                  said—</p>
               <p>"It won't do to be idle, Gordon; that's clear. An idle man is tempted ten times to
                  another's once. You will never be able to keep the pledge unless you get something
                  to do. We must assist you in this matter. What can you do besides your trade?"</p>
               <p>"I have little skill beyond my regular calling; but then, I have health, strength,
                  and willingness; and I think these might be made useful in something."</p>
               <p>"So do I. Now to start with, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you will come and open
                  my store for me every morning, make the fire and sweep out, and come and stay an
                  hour for me every day while I go to dinner, I will give you three dollars a week.
                  Two hours a day is all your time I shall want."</p>
               <p>"Thank you from my heart! Of course I accept your offer. So far so good," said
                  Gordon, brightening up.</p>
               <p>"Very well. You may begin with to-morrow morning. No doubt you can make an equal
                  sum by acting as a light porter for the various stores about. I can throw a little
                  in your way; and I will speak to my neighbors to do the same." There was not a
                  happier home in the whole town than was the home of Henry Gordon that night, poor
                  as it was.</p>
               <p>"I knew it would all come out right," said Mrs. Gordon. "I knew a better day was
                  coming. We can live quite comfortably upon five or six dollars a week, and be
                  happier than we have been for years."</p>
               <p>When Gordon thought of the past, he did not wonder that tears fell over the face
                  of his wife, even while her lips and eyes were bright with smiles. As the friend
                  had supposed, Gordon was employed to do many errands by the storekeepers in the
                  neighborhood. Some weeks he made five dollars and sometimes six or seven. This
                  went on for a few months, when he began to feel discouraged. The recollection of
                  other and brighter days returned frequently to his mind, and he began ardently to
                  desire an improved external condition, as well for his wife and children as for
                  himself. He wished to restore what had been lost; but saw no immediate prospect of
                  being able to do so. Six dollars a week was the average of his earnings, and it
                  took all this, besides what little his wife earned, to make things tolerably
                  comfortable at home.</p>
               <p>Gordon was in a more desponding mood than usual, when he indulged in the complaint
                  with which our story opens. What was said to him changed the tone of his feelings,
                  and inspired him with a spirit of cheerfulness and hope.</p>
               <p>"Time, Faith, Energy!" he said to himself, as he walked with a more elastic step.
                  "Yes, these must bring out all right in the end. I will not be so weak as to
                  despond. All is much improved as it is. We are happier and better. Time, Faith,
                  Energy! I will trust in these."</p>
               <p>When Gordon opened the door of his humble abode, he<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000042"/> found a lad waiting to see him, who arose, and
                  presenting a small piece of paper, said—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Blake wishes to know when you can settle this?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Blake was a grocer, to whom ten dollars had been owing for a year. He had
                  dunned the poor drunkard for the money until he got tired of so profitless a
                  business, and gave up the account for lost. By some means, it had recently come to
                  his ears that Gordon had signed the pledge.</p>
               <p>"Some chance for me yet," he said, and immediately had the bill made out anew, and
                  sent in; not thinking or caring whether it might not be premature for him to do
                  so, and have the effect to discourage the poor man and drive him back to his old
                  habits. What he wanted was his money. It was his due; and he meant to have it if
                  he could get it.</p>
               <p>"Tell Mr. Blake that I will pay him as soon as possible. At present it is out of
                  my power," said Gordon, in answer to the demand.</p>
               <p>The lad, in the spirit of his master, turned away with a sulky air, and left the
                  house.</p>
               <p>Poor Gordon's feelings went down to zero in a moment.</p>
               <p>"It's hopeless, Mary! I see it all as plain as day," he said. "The moment I get
                  upon my feet, there will be a dozen to knock me down. While I was a drunkard, no
                  one thought of dunning me for money; but now that I am trying to do right, every
                  one to whom I am indebted a dollar will come pouncing down upon me."</p>
               <p>"It's a just debt, Henry, you know, and we ought to pay it."</p>
               <p>"I don't dispute that. But we can't pay it now."</p>
               <p>"Then Blake can't get it now; so there the matter will have to rest. A little
                  dunning won't kill us. We have had harder trials than that to bear. So don't get
                  discouraged so easily."</p>
               <p>The words "Time, Faith, Energy!" came into the mind of Gordon and rebuked him.</p>
               <p>"There is sense in what you say, Mary," he replied. "I know I am too easily
                  discouraged. We owe Blake, that is clear; and I suppose he is right in trying to
                  get his money. We can't pay him now; and therefore he can't get it now, do what he
                  will. So we will be no worse for his dunning, if he duns every day. But I hate so
                  to be asked for money."</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what might be done," said Mrs. Gordon.</p>
               <p>"Well?" inquired the husband.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Blake has a large family, and no doubt his wife gives out a good deal of
                  sewing. I could work it out."</p>
               <p>Gordon thought a few moments, and then said—</p>
               <p>"Or, better than that; perhaps Blake would let me work it out in his store. I have
                  a good deal of time on my hands unemployed."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that would be better," replied Mrs. Gordon; "for I have as much sewing as I
                  can do, and get paid for it all."</p>
               <p>This thought brightened the spirits of Gordon. As soon as he had eaten his dinner
                  he started for the store of Mr. Blake.</p>
               <p>"I've come to talk to you about that bill of mine," said Mr. Gordon.</p>
               <p>"Well, what of it?" returned the grocer. "I wish to pay it, but have not the
                  present ability. I lost my situation on the very day I signed the pledge, and have
                  had no regular employment since. So far, I have only been able to pick up five or
                  six dollars a week, and it takes all that to live upon. But I have time to spare,
                  Mr. Blake, if I have no money; and if I can pay you in labor, I will be glad to do
                  so."</p>
               <p>"I don't know that I could ask more than that," replied the grocer. "If I did, I
                  would be unreasonable. Let me see: I reckon I could find a day's work for you
                  about the store at least once a week, for which I would allow you a credit of one
                  dollar and a quarter. How would that do?"</p>
               <p>"It would be exactly what I would like. I can spare you a day easily. And it is
                  much better to work out an old debt than to be idle."</p>
               <p>"Very well, Gordon. Come to-morrow and work for me, and I will pass a dollar and a
                  quarter to your account. I like this. It shows you are an honest man. Never fear
                  but what you'll get along."</p>
               <p>The approving words of the grocer encouraged Gordon very much. On the next day he
                  went as he had agreed and worked for Mr. Blake. When he was about leaving the
                  store at night, Blake called to him and said—</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5627-00000043"/>
               <p>"Here, Gordon; stop a moment. I want you to put up a pound of this white crushed
                  sugar; and a quarter of young hyson tea."</p>
               <p>Gordon did as he was directed. Blake took the two packages from the counter, and
                  handing them to Gordon, said—</p>
               <p>"Take them to your wife with my compliments, and tell her that I wish her joy of
                  an honest husband."</p>
               <p>Gordon took the unexpected favor, and without speaking, turned hastily from the
                  grocer and walked away.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Behind <emph>that</emph> frowning Providence</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">He hid a smiling face,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> said Mrs. Gordon, with tearful eyes, when her husband presented her the sugar
                  and tea, and repeated what the grocer had said.</p>
               <p>"Yes. It was a blessing sent to us in disguise," returned Gordon. "How little do
                  we know of the good or ill that lies in our immediate future!"</p>
               <p>"Do not say ill, dear husband—only seeming ill; if we think right and do right.
                  When God makes our future, all is good; the ill is of our own procuring."</p>
               <p>"Right, Mary. I see that truth as clear as if a sunbeam shone upon it."</p>
               <p>"Time, Faith, Energy!" murmured Gordon to himself, as he lay awake that night,
                  thinking of the future. Before losing himself in sleep, he had made up his mind to
                  go to another creditor for a small amount, and see if he could not make a similar
                  arrangement with him to the one entered into with the grocer. The man demurred a
                  little, and then said he would take time to think about it. When Gordon called
                  again, he declined the proposition, and said he had sold his goods for money, not
                  for work.</p>
               <p>"But I have no money," replied Gordon.</p>
               <p>"I'll wait awhile and see," returned the man, in a way and with a significance
                  that fretted the mind of Gordon.</p>
               <p>"He'll wait until he sees me getting a little ahead, and then pounce down upon me
                  like a hawk upon his prey."</p>
               <p>Over this idea the reformed man worried himself, and went home to his wife unhappy
                  and dispirited.</p>
               <p>"I owe at least a hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars," he said; "and there
                  is no hope of inducing all of those to whom money is due to wait until we can pay
                  them with comfort to ourselves. I shall be tormented to death, I see that plain
                  enough."</p>
               <p>"Don't you look at the dark side, Henry?" replied his wife to this. "I think you
                  do. You owe some eight or ten persons, and one of them has asked you for what was
                  due. You offered to work out the debt, and he accepted your offer. To another who
                  has not asked you, you go and make the same offer, which he declines, preferring
                  to wait for the money. There is nothing so really discouraging in all this, I am
                  sure. If he prefers waiting, let him wait. No doubt it will be the same to us in
                  the end. As to our getting much ahead or many comforts around us until our debts
                  are settled off, we might as well not think of that. We will feel better to pay
                  what we owe as fast as we earn it; and, more than that, it will put the temptation
                  to distress us in nobody's way. If one man won't let you work out your debt, why
                  another will. I've no doubt that two-thirds of your creditors will be glad to
                  avail themselves of the offer."</p>
               <p>Thus re-assured, Gordon felt better. On the next day he tried a third party to
                  whom he owed fifteen dollars. This man happened to keep a retail grocery and
                  liquor store. That is, he had a bar at one counter, and sold groceries at the
                  other. Two-thirds of the debt was for liquor. "I want to wipe off that old score
                  of mine, if I can, Mr. King," said Gordon, as he met the storekeeper at his own
                  door.</p>
               <p>"That's clever," replied Mr. King. "Walk in. What will you take? Some brandy?"</p>
               <p>And Mr. King stepped behind the counter and laid his hand upon a decanter.</p>
               <p>"Nothing at all, I thank you," replied Gordon quickly.</p>
               <p>"Why how's that? Have you sworn off?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I've joined the temperance society."</p>
               <p>The storekeeper shrugged his shoulders. "I didn't expect that of you, Gordon. I
                  thought you were too fond of a little creature comfort."</p>
               <p>"I ruined myself and beggared my family by drink, if that is what you mean by
                  creature comfort. Poor comfort it was for my wife and children, to say nothing of
                  my own case, which was, Heaven knows, bad enough. But I<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000044"/> have come to talk to you about paying off that old
                  score. Now that I've given up drinking, I want to try and be honest if I can."</p>
               <p>"That's right. I like to see a man, when he sets out to be decent, go the whole
                  figure. Have you got the money?"</p>
               <p>"No. I wish I had. I have no money and not half work; but I have time on my hands,
                  Mr. King."</p>
               <p>"Time? That is what some people call money. You want to pay me in time, instead of
                  money, I presume? Rather rich, that, Gordon! But time don't pass current, like
                  money, in these diggins, my friend. There are a plenty who come here—and throw it
                  away for nothing. I can get more than I want."</p>
               <p>"I have no wish to throw my time away, nor to pass it upon you for money, Mr.
                  King. What I want is, to render you some service—in other words, to work for you,
                  if you can give me something to do. I have time on my hands unemployed, and I wish
                  to turn it to some good account."</p>
               <p>"O, yes. I understand now. Very well, Gordon; I rather think I can meet your
                  views. Yesterday my barkeeper was sent to prison for getting into a scrape while
                  drunk, and I want his place supplied until he gets out. Come and tend bar for me a
                  couple of weeks, and I will give you a receipt in full of all demands."</p>
               <p>Gordon shook his head and looked grave.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter? Won't you do it?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir. I can't do that."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because I have sworn neither to taste, touch, nor handle the accursed thing.
                  Neither to drink it myself, nor put it to the lips of another. No, no, Mr. King, I
                  can't do that. But I will sell your groceries for you three days in the week, for
                  four weeks. Part of my time is already regularly engaged."</p>
               <p>"Go off about your business!" said the store-keeper, his face red with anger at
                  the language of the reformed man, which he was pleased to consider highly
                  insulting. "I'll see to collecting that bill in a different way from that."</p>
               <p>By this time Gordon was learning not to be frightened and discouraged at every
                  thing. His wife had so often showed him its folly, that he felt ashamed to go to
                  her again in a desponding mood, and therefore cheered himself up before going
                  home.</p>
               <p>In other quarters he found rather better success. Not all of those he owed were of
                  the stamp of the two to whom application had last been made. In less than six
                  months he had worked out nearly a hundred dollars of what he owed, and had regular
                  employment that brought him in six dollars every week, besides earning, by odd
                  jobs and light porterage, from two to three dollars. His wife rarely let a week go
                  without producing her one or two dollars by needle-work. Little comforts gradually
                  crept in, notwithstanding all their debts were not yet paid off. This was
                  inevitable.</p>
               <p>By the end of twelve months Gordon found himself clear of debt, and in a good
                  situation in a store at five hundred dollars a year.</p>
               <p>"So much for 'Time, Faith, Energy,'" he said to himself, as he walked backwards
                  and forwards, in his comfortable little home, one evening, thinking of the
                  incidents of the year, and the results that had followed. "I would not have
                  believed it. Scarcely a twelvemonth has passed, and here am I, a sober man and out
                  of debt."</p>
               <p>"Though still very far from the advanced position in the world you held a few
                  years ago, and to which you can never more attain," said a desponding voice within
                  him. "A man never has but one chance for attaining ease and competence in this
                  life. If he neglects that, he need not waste his time in any useless
                  struggles."</p>
               <p>"Time, Faith, Energy!" spoke out another voice. "If one year has done so much for
                  you, what will not five, ten, or twenty years do? Redouble your energies, have
                  confidence in the future, and time will make all right."</p>
               <p>"I will have faith in time; I will have energy!" responded the man in Gordon,
                  speaking aloud.</p>
               <p>From that time Gordon and his wife lived with even stricter economy than before,
                  in order to lay by a little money with which he could,—at some future time,
                  re-commence his own business, which was profitable. There was still only a single
                  shop in town, and that was the one owned by his old employer, who had, in fact,
                  built himself up on<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5627-00000045"/> his downfall, when he
                  took to drinking and neglecting his business. On less than a thousand dollars
                  Gordon did not think of commencing business. Less than that he knew would make the
                  effort a doubtful one. This amount he expected to save in about five years.</p>
               <p>Two years of this time had elapsed, and Gordon had four hundred dollars invested
                  and bearing interest. He still held his situation at five hundred dollars per
                  annum. The only shop yet established in the town for doing the work for which he
                  was qualified both as a journeyman and master workman, was that owned and still
                  carried on by his old employer, who had made a good deal of money; but who had, of
                  late, fallen into habits of dissipation and neglected his business.</p>
               <p>One evening, while Gordon was reading at home in his comfortable little
                  sitting-room, with his wife beside him engaged with her needle, and both feeling
                  very contented, there was a rap at the door. On opening it Gordon recognized Mr.
                  Evenly, and politely invited him to come in. After being seated, his old employer,
                  who showed too plainly the debasing signs of frequent intoxication, said—</p>
               <p>"Gordon what are you doing now?"</p>
               <p>The reformed man stated the nature of his occupation.</p>
               <p>"What salary do you receive?" asked Evenly.</p>
               <p>"Five hundred dollars a year."</p>
               <p>"Do you like your present employment?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, very well. It is lighter than my old business, and much cleaner."</p>
               <p>"Would you be willing to come to work for me again?" further inquired Evenly.</p>
               <p>"I don't know that I would. My present situation is permanent, my employer a very
                  pleasant man, and my work easy."</p>
               <p>"Three things that are very desirable, certainly. But I'll tell you what I want,
                  and what I will give you. Perhaps we can make a bargain. There is no man in town
                  who understands our business better than you do. That I am free to admit.
                  Heretofore I have been my own manager; but I am satisfied that it will be for my
                  interest to have a competent foreman in my establishment. If I can find one to
                  suit me I will give him liberal wages. You will do exactly; and if you will take
                  charge of my shop, I will make your wages fifteen dollars a week. What do you say
                  to that?"</p>
               <p>"I rather think," replied Gordon, "that I will accept your offer. Five dollars a
                  week advance in wages for a poor man is a consideration not lightly to be passed
                  by."</p>
               <p>"It is not, certainly," remarked Evenly. "Then I may consider it settled that you
                  will take charge of my shop."</p>
               <p>"Yes. I believe I needn't hesitate about the matter."</p>
               <p>So the arrangement was made, and Gordon went back to the shop as foreman, from
                  which he had been discharged as a journeyman three years before.</p>
               <p>Firmly bent upon commencing the business for himself, whenever he should feel
                  himself able to do so, Gordon continued his frugal mode of living for two years
                  longer, when the amount of his savings, interest and all added, was very nearly
                  fifteen hundred dollars. The time had now come for him to take the step he had
                  contemplated for four years. Evenly received the announcement with undisguised
                  astonishment. After committing to such competent hands the entire manufacturing
                  part of his business, he had given himself up more and more to dissipation. Had it
                  not been for the active and energetic manner in which the affairs of the shop were
                  conducted by Gordon, every thing would have fallen into disorder. But in a fair
                  ratio with the neglect of his principal was he efficient as his agent.</p>
               <p>"I can't let you go," said Evenly, when Gordon informed him of his intention to go
                  into business for himself. "If fifteen dollars a week doesn't satisfy you, you
                  shall have twenty."</p>
               <p>"It is not the wages," replied Gordon. "I wish to go into business for myself.
                  From the first this has been my intention."</p>
               <p>"But you haven't the capital."</p>
               <p>"Yes. I have fifteen hundred dollars."</p>
               <p>"You have!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I have saved it in four years. That will give me a fair start. I am not
                  afraid for the rest."'</p>
               <p>Evenly felt well satisfied that if Gordon went into business for himself, his own
                  would be ruined, and therefore, finding all efforts to dissuade him from his
                  purpose of no<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5627-00000046"/> avail, he offered to take
                  him in as a partner. But to this came an unexpected objection. Gordon was averse
                  to such a connection. Being pressed to state the reason why, he frankly said—</p>
               <p>"My unwillingness to enter into business with you arises from the fact that you
                  are, as I was four years ago, a slave to strong drink. You are not yourself one
                  half of the time, and hardly ever in a fit condition to attend to business. Pardon
                  me for saying this. But you asked for my reason, and I have given it."</p>
               <p>Evenly, at first, was angry. But reflection soon came, and then he felt humiliated
                  as he had never felt before. There was no intention on the part of Gordon to
                  insult him, nor to triumph over him, but rather a feeling of sorrow; and this
                  Evenly saw.</p>
               <p>"And this is your only objection?" he at length said.</p>
               <p>"I have none other," replied Gordon.</p>
               <p>"If it did not exist you would meet my proposals?"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly."</p>
               <p>"Then it shall no longer exist. From this hour I will be as free from the vice you
                  have named as you are."</p>
               <p>"Will you sign the pledge?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, this very hour."</p>
               <p>And he did so.</p>
               <p>A year afterwards an old friend, who had joined the temperance ranks about the
                  time Gordon did, and who had only got along moderately well, passed the
                  establishment of EVENLY &amp; GORDON, and saw the latter standing in the door.</p>
               <p>"Are you in this concern?" he asked, in some surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And making money fast?"</p>
               <p>"We are doing very well."</p>
               <p>"Gordon, I don't understand this altogether. I tried to recover myself, but soon
                  got discouraged, and have ever since plodded along in a poor way I live, it is
                  true; but you are doing much better than that. What is your secret?"</p>
               <p>"It lies in three words," replied Gordon.</p>
               <p>"Name them."</p>
               <p>"Time, Faith, Energy!"</p>
               <p>The man looked startled for a moment, and then walked away wiser than when he
                  asked the question. Whether he will profit by the answer we cannot tell. Others
                  may, if they will.</p>

               <head>FLUSHED WITH WINE.</head>
               <p>"WASN'T that Ernestine Lee that we passed this moment?" asked Harvey Lane, a young
                  M.D., of his friend James Everett, in a tone of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I believe it was—"Everett returned, rather coldly.</p>
               <p>"You believe it was! Surely, James, nothing has occurred to destroy the intimacy
                  that has for some time existed between you."</p>
               <p>"You saw that we did not speak."</p>
               <p>"I did."</p>
               <p>"And, probably, shall never be on terms of friendship again."</p>
               <p>"What you say pains me very much, James. Of course there is a reason for so great
                  a change. May I ask what it is?"</p>
               <p>"It is, no doubt, a good deal my own fault. But still, I cannot help thinking that
                  she has taken offence too suddenly, where no offence was intended. You know that I
                  have been long paying attentions to her?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"If I remember rightly, I told you last week, that my intentions towards her were
                  of a serious character. In a word, that I had fully made up my mind to ask her
                  hand in marriage."</p>
               <p>"O, yes,—I remember it very well. And that is the reason why I felt so much
                  surprised at seeing you pass each other, without speaking."</p>
               <p>"Well, a few evenings ago, I called, as usual, intending, if a good opportunity
                  offered, to make known my true feelings towards her. Unfortunately, I had dined
                  out that day with some young friends. We sat late at table, and when I left, I was
                  a <emph>little flushed with wine</emph>. It was a very little, for you know that I
                  can drink pretty freely without its being seen. But, somehow, or other, I was more
                  elated than is usual with me on such occasions, and when I called on Ernestine,
                  felt as free and easy as if everything was settled, and we were to be married in a
                  week. For a time, we chatted together very pleasantly; then I asked her to play
                  and sing for me. She went to the piano, at my request, and played and sung two or
                  three very sweet airs. I don't know which it was that elated my feelings so
                  much—the wine, or the delightful music. Certain it is, that at the conclusion of a
                  piece, I was in such rapture, that I threw my arms around her neck, drew back her
                  head, and kissed her with emphatic earnestness."</p>
               <p>"Why, James!"</p>
               <p>"You may well be surprised at the commission of so rude and ungentlemanly an act.
                  But, as I have said, I was flushed with wine."</p>
               <p>"How did Ernestine act?"</p>
               <p>"She was, of course, deeply indignant at the unwarrantable liberty. Springing from
                  the piano-stool, her face crimsoned over, she drew herself up with a dignified
                  air, and ordered me instantly to leave her presence. I attempted to make an
                  apology, but she would not hear a word. I have since written to her, but my letter
                  has been returned unopened."</p>
               <p>"Really, that is unfortunate," the friend of Everett said, with concern.
                  "Ernestine is a girl whom any man might be proud to gain as a wife. And, besides
                  her personal qualifications, a handsome fortune will go with her hand."</p>
               <p>"I know all that too well, Harvey. Fool that I have been, to mar such prospects as
                  were mine! But she must have known that I was not myself—and ought to have charged
                  the fault upon the wine, and not upon me."</p>
               <p>"Such a discrimination is not usually made."</p>
               <p>"I know that it is not. And for not making it in my case, I certainly cannot help
                  blaming Ernestine a little. She must have known, that, had I not been flushed with
                  wine, I never would have taken the liberty with her that I did. As it is, however,
                  I am not only pained at the consequences of my foolishness, but deeply mortified
                  at my conduct."</p>
               <p>"Is there no hope of a reconciliation?"</p>
               <p>"I do not think there is any. If she had accepted my<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000048"/> written apology for the act, there would have been
                  some hope. But the fact of her returning my letter unopened, is conclusive as to
                  the permanency of the breach. I can now make no further advances."</p>
               <p>"Truly, it is mortifying!" the friend remarked. Then, after a pause, he added,
                  with emphasis—</p>
               <p>"What fools this wine does make of us, sometimes!"</p>
               <p>"Doesn't it? Another such a circumstance as this, would almost drive me to join a
                  temperance society."</p>
               <p>"O, no, hardly that, James."</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps not. But, at least, to eschew wine for ever."</p>
               <p>"Wine is good enough in its place; but, like fire, is rather a bad master. Like
                  you, I have injured my prospects in life by an over-indulgence in the pleasures of
                  the cup."</p>
               <p>"You?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"When did that happen?"</p>
               <p>"Since I last saw you."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I am sorry to hear you say so. But how was it?—tell me."</p>
               <p>"You know, that as a young physician, I shall have to struggle on in this city for
                  years before I can rise to any degree of distinction, unless aided by some
                  fortunate circumstance, that shall be as a stepping-stone upon which to elevate
                  me, and enable me to gain the public eye. I am conscious that I have mastered
                  thoroughly the principles of my profession—and that, in regard to surgery,
                  particularly, I possess a skill not surpassed by many who have handled the knife
                  for years. Of this fact, my surgical teacher, who is my warm friend, is fully
                  aware. At every important case that he has, I am desired to be present, and assist
                  in the operation, and once or twice, where there were no friends of the patient to
                  object, I have been permitted to perform the operation myself, and always with
                  success. In this department of my profession, I feel great confidence in
                  myself—and it is that part of it, in which I take the most interest."</p>
               <p>"And in which, I doubt not, you will one day be distinguished."</p>
               <p>"I trust so; and yet, things look dark enough just now. But to go on. A few days
                  ago, I dined with some friends. After dinner, the bottle was circulated pretty
                  freely, and I drank as freely as the rest, but was not aware of having taken
                  enough to produce upon me any visible effects. It was about an hour after the
                  table had been cleared for the wine, that an unusually loud ringing of the
                  door-bell attracted our attention. In a few moments after, I heard a voice asking,
                  in hurried tones, for Doctor Lane. Going down at once to the hall, I found old Mr.
                  Camper there, the rich merchant, in a state of great agitation.</p>
               <p>"'Doctor,' said he, grasping my arm,—'a most terrible accident has happened to my
                  daughter!—thrown from a carriage!—My physician cannot be found, and as I have
                  often heard your skill warmly alluded to by him, I desire your instant attendance.
                  My carriage is at the door—Come along with me, quickly.'</p>
               <p>"Catching up my hat, I attended him at once, and during our rapid drive to his
                  princely residence, learned that his only daughter had been thrown from a
                  carriage, and dreadfully injured; but in what way, could not ascertain.
                  Unaccountably to myself, I found my mind all in confusion,—and, strange,
                  unprofessional omission! forgot to request that I be driven first to my office for
                  my case of instruments. We had not proceeded half the distance to Mr. Camper's
                  residence, before I noticed that the old man became silent, and that his eye was
                  fixed upon me with a steady, scrutinizing gaze. This added to the confusion of
                  mind which I felt. At length the carriage stopped, and I accompanied Mr. Camper to
                  his daughter's chamber, hurriedly, and in silence. As I paused by the bed upon
                  which she lay, I again noticed that he was regarding me with a steady searching
                  look, and an expression of face that I did not like, and could not understand.</p>
               <p>"I proceeded, however, at once, to examine the condition of my patient, who lay in
                  a kind of stupor. There was a deep gash on the side of her face, from which the
                  blood had issued profusely. By the aid of warm-water, I soon cleared the wound
                  from a mass of coagulated blood that had collected around it, and was glad to find
                  that it was not a serious one. I then proceeded to examine if there were any
                  fractures. All this time my<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5627-00000049"/> hands were
                  unsteady, my face burned, and my mind was confused. <emph>I was conscious that I
                     had taken too much wine.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"'There is no apparent injury here,' I at length said, after examining the arms
                  and chest. 'She is probably only stunned by the concussion.'</p>
               <p>"'But she could not stand on her feet when first lifted after the fall, and
                  fainted immediately upon attempting to sustain her own weight,' Mr. Camper
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"I then made further examination, and found sad indications of her fall, in a
                  fractured patella. The knee was, however, so swollen, that I could not ascertain
                  the nature, nor extent of the fracture.</p>
               <p>"'What do you find the matter there, doctor?' Mr. Camper asked, after I had
                  finished my examination.</p>
               <p>"'A very serious injury, sir, I am sorry to say,' was my reply.</p>
               <p>"'Of what nature?' was his somewhat stern inquiry.</p>
               <p>"'Her knee-pan is fractured, sir; but so much swollen, that I cannot, now, fully
                  ascertain the extent of the injury.'"</p>
               <p>"Henry!" cried the old man in a quick, eager tone to an attendant, "go again for
                  doctor L——; and if he is not in, go for doctor R——; and if you cannot find him,
                  call on doctor T——, and ask him to come instantly."</p>
               <p>The attendant hurriedly departed, when Mr. Camper turned slowly towards me, with a
                  mingled expression of anger, pain, and contempt, upon his face, and said, in a
                  stern voice,</p>
               <p>"'Go home young man! and quit drinking wine, or quit the profession! You are in no
                  fit state to undertake a case like this.'</p>
               <p>"It came upon me like a peal of thunder from an unclouded summer sky. It was the
                  knell of newly-awakened hopes—the darkening of newly-opening prospects. Silently I
                  turned away under the cutting rebuke, and left the house."</p>
               <p>"Really, that was most unfortunate!" his friend Everett remarked, with earnest
                  sympathy.</p>
               <p>"Could anything have been more unfortunate, or more mortifying. Her case was one
                  that I fully understood; and could have treated successfully. It would have
                  brought me into contact with the family for six months, or more, and the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">eclat</foreign> which I should have derived from the case, would
                  have given me a prominence as a young surgeon, that I am afraid the fact of my
                  losing the case under such mortifying circumstances, will prevent me ever
                  attaining in this city."</p>
               <p>"Really, Harvey, I do feel exceedingly pained at what you have told me. Confound
                  this wine! I believe it does more harm than good."</p>
               <p>"Too free an indulgence of it does, no doubt. Our error has lain in this. We must
                  be more prudent in future."</p>
               <p>"Suppose we swear off for ever from touching it."</p>
               <p>"No, I will not do that. Wine is good in its place, and I shall continue to use
                  it, but more moderately. A physician never knows the moment he may be called upon,
                  and should, therefore, always be in a state to exercise a clear head and a steady
                  hand."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, we have both of us had lessons not soon to be forgotten," was the
                  reply; and then the two young men separated.</p>
               <p>Two weeks from the day this conversation took place, doctor Lane and his friend
                  James Everett met at a supper-party, where all kinds of liquors were introduced,
                  and every kind of inducement held out for the company to drink freely. Both of the
                  young men soon forgot their resolutions to be guarded in respect to the use of
                  wine. As the first few glasses began to take effect, in an elevation of spirits,
                  each felt a kind of pride in the thought that he could bear as much as any one
                  there, and not show signs of intoxication.</p>
               <p>By eleven o'clock, there was not one at the table who was not drunk enough to be
                  foolish. The rational and intelligent conversation that had been introduced early
                  in the evening, had long since given place to the obscene jest—the vulgar story—or
                  the bacchanalian song. Gayest of the gay were our young men, who had already, one
                  would think, received sufficient lessons of prudence and temperance.</p>
               <p>"Take care, James!" cried Lane, across the table to his friend Everett,
                  familiarly, late in the evening. "You<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5627-00000050"/> are
                  pouring the wine on the table, instead of in your glass."</p>
               <p>"You are beginning to see double," was Everett's reply, lifting his head with a
                  slight drunken air, and throwing a half-angry glance upon his friend.</p>
               <p>"That is more than you can do," was the retort, with a meaning toss of the
                  head.</p>
               <p>"I don't understand you," Everett said, pausing with the decanter still in his
                  hand, and eyeing his friend, steadily.</p>
               <p>"Don't you, indeed! You see yourself in a state of blessed singleness—ha! Do you
                  take?"</p>
               <p>"Look here, James,—you are my friend. But there are things that I will not allow
                  even a friend to utter. So take care now!"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! There comes the raw. Do I rub too hard, my boy?"</p>
               <p>"You 're drunk, and a fool into the bargain!" was the angry retort of Everett.</p>
               <p>"Not so drunk as you were when you hugged and kissed Ernestine Lee! How do you
                  like—?"</p>
               <p>Lane could not finish the sentence, before the decanter which Everett had held in
                  his hand glanced past his head with fearful velocity, and was dashed into
                  fragments against the wall behind him. The instant interference of friends
                  prevented any further acts of violence.</p>
               <p>It was about ten o'clock on the next morning that young doctor Lane sat in his
                  office, musing on the events of the previous night, of which he had only a
                  confused recollection, when a young man entered, and presented a note. On opening
                  it, he found it to be a challenge from Everett.</p>
               <p>"Leave me your card, and I will refer my friend to you," was his reply, with a
                  cold bow, as he finished reading the note. The card was left, and the stranger,
                  with a frigid bow in return, departed.</p>
               <p>"Fool, fool that I have been!" ejaculated Lane, rising to his feet, and pacing the
                  floor of his office backwards and forwards with hurried steps. This was continued
                  for nearly half an hour, during which time his countenance wore a painful and
                  gloomy expression. At last, pausing, and seating himself at a table, he murmured,
                  as he lifted a pen,</p>
               <p>"It is too late now for vain regrets."</p>
               <p>He then wrote a note with a hurried air, and dispatched it by an attendant. This
                  done, he again commenced pacing the floor of his office, but now with slower
                  steps, and a face expressive of sad determination. In about twenty minutes a young
                  man entered, saying, as he did so—</p>
               <p>"I'm here at a word, Harvey—and now what is this important business which I can do
                  for you, and for which you are going to be so everlastingly obliged?"</p>
               <p>"That will tell you," Lane briefly said, handing him the challenge he had
                  received.</p>
               <p>The young man's face turned pale as he read the note.</p>
               <p>"Bless me, Harvey!" he ejaculated, as he threw the paper upon the table. "This is
                  a serious matter, truly! Why how have you managed to offend Everett? I always
                  thought that you were friends of the warmest kind."</p>
               <p>"So we have been, until now. And at this moment, I have not an unkind thought
                  towards him, notwithstanding he threw a bottle of wine at my head last night,
                  which, had it taken effect, would have, doubtless, killed me instantly."</p>
               <p>"How in the world did that happen, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"We were both flushed with wine, at the time. I said something that I ought not to
                  have said—something which had I been myself, I would have cut off my right hand
                  before I would have uttered—and it roused him into instant passion."</p>
               <p>"And not satisfied with throwing the bottle of wine at your head, he now sends you
                  a challenge?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. And I must accept it, notwithstanding I have no angry feelings against him;
                  and, but for the hasty step he has now taken, would have most willingly asked his
                  pardon."</p>
               <p>"That, of course, is out of the question now," the friend replied. "But I will see
                  his second; and endeavour, through him, to bring about a reconciliation, if I can
                  do so, honourably, to yourself."</p>
               <p>"As to that," replied Lane, "I have nothing to say.<pb n="100"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000051"/> If he insists upon a meeting, I will give him the
                  satisfaction he seeks."</p>
               <p>It was about half an hour after, that the friend of Lane called upon the friend of
                  Everett. They were old acquaintances.</p>
               <p>"You represent Everett, I believe, in this unpleasant affair between him and
                  doctor Lane," the latter said.</p>
               <p>"I do," was the grave reply.</p>
               <p>"Surely we can prevent a meeting!" the friend of Lane said, with eagerness.</p>
               <p>"I do not see how," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"They were flushed with wine when the provocation occurred, and this ought to
                  prevent a fatal meeting. If Lane insulted Everett, it was because he was not
                  himself. Had he been perfectly sober, he would never have uttered an offensive
                  word."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not. But with that I have nothing to do. He has insulted my friend, and
                  that friend asks a meeting. He can do no less than grant it—or prove himself a
                  coward."</p>
               <p>"I really cannot see the necessity that this should follow," urged the other. "It
                  seems to me, that it is in our power to prevent any hostile meeting."</p>
               <p>"How?"</p>
               <p>"By representing to the principals in this unhappy affair, the madness of seeking
                  each other's lives. You can learn from Everett what kind of an apology, if any,
                  will satisfy him, and then I can ascertain whether such an apology will be
                  made."</p>
               <p>"You can do what you please in that way," the friend of Everett replied. "But I am
                  not disposed to transcend my office. Besides, I know that, as far as Everett is
                  concerned, no apology will be accepted. The insult was outrageous, involving a
                  breach of confidence, and referring to a subject of the most painful, mortifying,
                  and delicate nature."</p>
               <p>"I am really sorry to hear that both you and your friend are determined to push
                  this matter to an issue, for I had hoped that an adjustment of the difficulty
                  would be easy."</p>
               <p>"No adjustment can possibly take place. Doctor Lane must fight, or be posted as a
                  coward, and a scoundrel."</p>
               <pb n="Illustration-101" xml:id="VAC5627-00000052"/>

               </p>
               <p>"He holds himself ready to give Mr. Everett all the satisfaction he requires," was
                  the half-indignant reply.</p>
               <p>"Then, of course, you are prepared to name the weapons; and the time and place of
                  meeting?"</p>
               <p>"I am not. For so confident did I feel that it would only be necessary to see you
                  to have all difficulties put in a train for adjustment, that I did not confer upon
                  the subject of the preliminaries of the meeting. But I will see you again, in the
                  course of an hour, when I shall be ready to name them."</p>
               <p>"If you please." And then the seconds parted.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid this meeting will take place in spite of all that I can do," the
                  friend of doctor Lane said, on returning after his interview with Everett's
                  second. "The provocation which you gave last night is felt to be so great, that no
                  apology can atone for it."</p>
               <p>"My blood probably will,—and he can have that!" was the gloomy reply.</p>
               <p>A troubled silence ensued, which was at last broken by the question,</p>
               <p>"Have you decided, doctor, upon the weapons to be used?"</p>
               <p>"Pistols, I suppose," was the answer.</p>
               <p>"Have you practised much?"</p>
               <p>"Me! No. I don't know that I ever fired a pistol in my life."</p>
               <p>"But Everett is said to be a good shot."</p>
               <p>"So much the worse for me. That is all."</p>
               <p>"You have the liberty of choosing some other weapon. One with which you are
                  familiar."</p>
               <p>"I am familiar with no kind of deadly weapons."</p>
               <p>"Then you will stand a poor chance, my friend; unless you name the day of meeting
                  next week, and practise a good deal in the meantime."</p>
               <p>"I shall do no such thing. Do you suppose, that if I fight with Everett, I shall
                  try to kill him? No. I would not hurt a hair of his head. I am no murderer!"</p>
               <p>"Then you go out under the existence of a fatal inequality."</p>
               <p>"I cannot help that. It is my misfortune. I did not send the challenge."</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5627-00000053"/>
               <p>"That is no reason why you should not make an effort to preserve your own
                  life."</p>
               <p>"If we both fire at once, and both of our balls take effect, the fact that my ball
                  strikes him will not benefit me any. And suppose he should be killed, and I
                  survive, do you think I could ever know a single hour's happiness? No—no—I choose
                  the least of two evils. I must fight. But I will not kill."</p>
               <p>"In this you are determined?"</p>
               <p>"I certainly am. I have weighed the matter well, and come to a positive
                  decision."</p>
               <p>"You choose pistols, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Let the weapons be pistols."</p>
               <p>"When shall the meeting take place?"</p>
               <p>"Let it be to-morrow morning, at sunrise. The quicker it is over, the better."</p>
               <p>This determined upon, the friend went again to the second of Everett, and
                  completed all necessary arrangements for the duel.</p>
               <p>It was midnight, and young doctor Lane sat alone in his chamber, beside a table,
                  upon which were ink and paper. He had, evidently, made several attempts to write;
                  and each time failed from some cause to accomplish his task. Several sheets of
                  paper had been written upon, and thrown aside. Each of these bore the following
                  words:—</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>My Dear Parents:—"When these lines are read by you, the hand that
                  penned them will be cold and nerveless—"</p>
               <p>Thus far the unhappy young man could go, but no farther. Imagination pictured too
                  vividly the heart-stricken father who had so often looked down upon him when a boy
                  with pride and pleasure, and the tender, but now agonized mother, as that
                  appalling announcement met their eyes.</p>
               <p>Again, for the fifth time, he took up his pen, murmuring in a low tone, yet with a
                  resolute air,</p>
               <p>"It must be done!"</p>
               <p>He had again written the words:—</p>
               <p>"My Dear Parents—"</p>
               <p>When his ear caught the sound of steps, strangely familiar to his ear, ascending
                  the stairs, and approaching his chamber. He paused, and listened with a heart
                  almost stilled in its pulsations. In a brief space, the door of his room opened,
                  and a grey-haired, feeble old man came slowly in.</p>
               <p>"My father!" exclaimed Harvey, starting to his feet in astonishment—scarcely, for
                  the moment, being able to realize whether it were indeed his father, or, only an
                  apparition.</p>
               <p>"Thank heaven! that I have found my son alive—" ejaculated the old man, uncovering
                  his head, and lifting his eyes upward. "O, Harvey, my child!" he then said, with
                  an earnest pathos, that touched the young man's heart—"how could you so far forget
                  us as to think even for a single moment of the dreadful act you are preparing to
                  commit?"</p>
               <p>"I had hoped to be spared this severest trial of all," the young man said, rising
                  and grasping the hand of his father, while the tears sprang to his eyes. "What
                  officious friend has taken the pains to disturb both your peace and mine—dragging
                  you thus away from your home, in the vain effort to prevent an act that must take
                  place."</p>
               <p>"Speak not so rashly, my son! It cannot, it must not, it shall not take
                  place!"</p>
               <p>"I have no power to prevent it, father."</p>
               <p>"You are a free agent."</p>
               <p>"Not to do a deed of dishonour,—or, rather, I am not free to suffer
                  dishonour."</p>
               <p>"There is no honour in wantonly risking or taking life, Harvey."</p>
               <p>"I insulted a friend, in the grossest manner."</p>
               <p>"<emph>That</emph> was dishonourable. But why did you insult him?"</p>
               <p>"I was <emph>flushed with wine</emph>."</p>
               <p>The old man shook his head, sadly.</p>
               <p>"I know it was wrong, father. But it can't be helped now. Well, as I said; I
                  insulted him, and he has demanded satisfaction. Can I do less than give it to
                  him?"</p>
               <p>"If you insulted him, you can apologize. And, from what I know of James Everett,
                  he will at once forgive."</p>
               <p>"I cannot do that now, father. He threw a bottle of wine at my head, and then
                  precipitately challenged me. I owe at least something to myself."</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5627-00000054"/>
               <p>"And something, I should think, to your mother, if not to me," replied the old
                  man, bitterly. "How, think you she will receive the news of your death, if the
                  combat should terminate fatally for you? Or, how, if your hands should become
                  stained with the blood of your friend?"</p>
               <p>"Talk not thus, father! Talk not thus!" ejaculated the young man, rising up
                  quickly, and beginning to pace the floor of his chamber with hurried steps. "Is
                  not my situation dreadful enough viewed in any light? Then why seek to agonize my
                  heart with what I would gladly forget? I am already racked with tortures that can
                  scarcely be endured—why seek to run my cup of misery over?"</p>
               <p>"I seek but to save you, my child," the father replied, in a voice that suddenly
                  became low and tremulous.</p>
               <p>"It is a vain effort. There is but one course for me, and that is to go on, and
                  meet whatever consequences ensue. The result may not be so bad as feared."</p>
               <p>"Harvey!" old Mr. Lane said, in a voice that had somewhat regained its steadiness
                  of tone. "This meeting must not take place. If you persist in going out tomorrow
                  morning, I must take measures to prevent it."</p>
               <p>"And thus dishonour your son."</p>
               <p>"All dishonour that will appertain to you, Harvey, appertains to you now. You
                  insulted your friend. Neither your death nor his can atone for that offence. If
                  reparation be truly made, it will come in some other form."</p>
               <p>"It is vain to urge that matter with me," was the reply to this. "I must give
                  James Everett the satisfaction he requires to-morrow morning. And now, father, if
                  I should fall, which heaven forbid for others' sakes more than my own," and the
                  young man's voice quivered, "break the matter to my mother as gently as
                  possible—tell her, that my last thoughts were of her, and my last prayer that she
                  might be given strength from above to bear this heavy affliction."</p>
               <milestone n="*    *    *    *    *    *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It was a damp, drizzly morning, just at break of day, when Harvey Lane,
                  accompanied by his friend, and a young physician, entered a close carriage, and
                  started for the duelling-ground, which had been selected, some four miles from the
                  city. Two neat mahogany cases were taken along, one containing a pair of duelling
                  pistols, and the other a set of surgical instruments. As these were handed in, the
                  eye of Lane rested upon them for a moment. They conjured up in his mind no very
                  pleasant thoughts. He was very pale, and silent. Nor did his companions seem in
                  much better condition, or much better spirits. A rapid drive of nearly three
                  quarters of an hour brought them upon the ground. The other party had not yet
                  arrived, but came up in a few minutes afterwards. Then commenced the formal
                  preparations. The ground was measured off—ten paces. The seconds prepared the
                  deadly weapons which were to heal the honour that had been so dreadfully wounded,
                  and arranged all the minor provisions of the duel.</p>
               <p>During all this time, neither of the young men looked towards each other, but each
                  paced rapidly over a little space of ground, backwards and forwards, with agitated
                  steps—though evidently with an effort to seem composed.</p>
               <p>"Ready," said Lane's second, at length, close to his ear.</p>
               <p>The young man started, and his cheek blanched to a pale hue. He had been thinking
                  of his father and mother. With almost the vividness of reality had he seen them
                  before him, and heard their earnest; tearful pleadings with him to forbear for
                  their sakes, if not for his own. But he took the deadly weapon in his hand
                  mechanically, and moved to the position that had been assigned him. The
                  arrangement was, that the seconds should give the words—one—two—three—in slow
                  succession, and that the parties should fire as soon after "three" was uttered, as
                  they chose.</p>
               <p>Their positions taken, the young men's eyes met for the first time—and for the
                  first time they looked again upon each other's faces. The word one had been given,
                  at which each raised his pistol,—<hi rend="i"/>two was uttered—and then another
                  individual was suddenly, and unexpectedly added to the party, who threw himself in
                  front of Harvey Lane, in range of both the deadly weapons. Turning, then, towards
                  Everett, he said, lifting his hat, and letting his thin grey hairs fall about his
                  forehead—</p>
               <p>"We cannot spare our son, yet, James! We are growing old, and he is our only
                  child. If he were taken thus<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5627-00000055"/> away from
                  us, we should not be able to bear it. For our sakes, then, James, if he has
                  injured you, forgive him."</p>
               <p>Already had the face of his old and long-tried friend, as he met its familiar
                  expression, softened in some degree the feelings of Everett, and modified the
                  angry vindictiveness which he still continued to cherish. The apparition of the
                  father, and his unexpected appeal, completely conquered him, and he threw, with a
                  sudden effort, his pistol away some twenty yards.</p>
               <p>"I am satisfied!" he said, in a low tone, advancing, and taking the old man's
                  hand. "You have conquered the vindictive pride of a foolish heart."</p>
               <p>"I know that I grossly insulted you, James"—Harvey Lane said, coming quickly
                  forward, and offering his hand. "But would I, could I have done it, if I had been
                  myself?"</p>
               <p>"No, Harvey, you could not! And I was mad and blind that I would not see
                  this"—Everett replied, grasping the hand of his friend. "We were both
                     <emph>flushed with wine</emph>, and that made both of us fools. Surely, Harvey,
                  we have had warning enough, of the evil of drinking. Within the last two weeks, it
                  has seriously marred our prospects in life, and now it has brought us out here
                  with the deliberate intent of taking each other's lives."</p>
               <p>"From this hour, I solemnly declare, that I will never again touch, taste, or
                  handle the accursed thing!" Lane said, with strong emphasis.</p>
               <p>"In that resolution I join you," replied Everett, with a like earnest manner. "And
                  let this resolution be the sealing bond of our perpetual friendship."</p>
               <p>"Amen!" ejaculated Harvey Lane, solemnly,—and, "Amen!" responded the old man,
                  fervently, lifting his eyes to Heaven.</p>

               <head>SWEARING OFF.</head>
               <p>"JOHN," said a sweet-faced girl, laying her hand familiarly upon the shoulder of a
                  young man who was seated, near a window in deep abstraction of mind. There was
                  something sad in her voice,—and her countenance, though, lovely, wore an
                  expression of pain.</p>
               <p>"What do you want, sister?" the young man replied, without lifting his eyes from
                  the floor.</p>
               <p>"You are not happy, brother."</p>
               <p>To this, there was no reply, and an embarrassing pause of some moments ensued.</p>
               <p>"May I speak a word with you, brother?"—the young girl at length said, with a tone
                  and manner that showed her to be compelling herself to the performance of a
                  painful and repugnant task.</p>
               <p>"On what subject, Alice?" the brother asked, looking up with a doubting
                  expression.</p>
               <p>This question brought the colour to Alice's cheeks, and the moisture to her
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"You know what I would say, John," she at length made out to utter, in a voice
                  that slightly trembled.</p>
               <p>"How should I know, sister?"</p>
               <p>"You were not yourself last night, John."</p>
               <p>"Alice!"</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, brother, for what I now say," the maiden rejoined. "It is a painful
                  trial, indeed; and were it not that I loved you so well—were it not that, besides
                  you, there is no one else in the wide world to whom I can look up, I might shrink
                  from a sister's duty. But I feel that it would be wrong for me not to whisper in
                  your ear one warning word—wrong not to try a sister's power over you."</p>
               <p>"I will forgive you this time, on one condition," the brother said, in a tone of
                  rebuke, and with a grave expression of countenance.</p>
               <p>"What is that?" asked Alice.</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5627-00000056"/>
               <p>"On condition that you never again, directly or indirectly, allude to this
                  subject. It is not in your province to do so. A sister should not look out for her
                  brother's faults."</p>
               <p>A sudden gush of tears followed this cold, half-angry repulse; and then the maiden
                  turned slowly away and left the room.</p>
               <p>John Barclay's anger towards his only sister, who had no one, as she had feelingly
                  said, in the wide world to look up to and love, but him, subsided the moment he
                  saw how deeply his rebuke had wounded her. But he could not speak to her, nor
                  recall his words—for the subject she had introduced was one so painful and
                  mortifying, that he could not bear an allusion to it.</p>
               <p>From long indulgence, the habit of drinking had become confirmed in the young man
                  to such a degree that he had almost ceased to resist an inclination that was
                  gaining a dangerous power over him. And yet there was in his mind an abiding
                  resolution one day to break away from this habit. He did not intend to become a
                  drunkard. Oh, no! The condition of a drunkard was too low and degrading. He could
                  never sink to that! After awhile, he intended to "swear off," as he called it, and
                  be done with the seductive poison altogether; but he had not yet been able to
                  bring so good a resolution into present activity. This being his state of
                  mind—conscious of danger, and yet unwilling to fly from that danger, he could not
                  bear any allusion to the subject.</p>
               <p>Half an hour, passed in troubled thought, elapsed after this brief interview
                  between the brother and sister, when the young man left the house and took his
                  way, scarcely reflecting upon where he was going, to one of his accustomed places
                  of resort—a fashionable drinking house, where every device that ingenuity could
                  invent, was displayed to attract custom. Splendid mirrors and pictures hung
                  against the walls, affecting the mind with pleasing thoughts—and tempting to
                  self-indulgence. There were lounges, where one might recline at ease, while he
                  sipped the delicious compounds the richly furnished bar afforded, never once
                  dreaming that a serpent lay concealed in the cup that he held to his lips—a
                  serpent that one day would sting him, perhaps unto death!</p>
               <p>"Regular as clock-work,"—said an old man, a friend of Barclay's father, who had
                  been dead several years, meeting the young man as he was about to enter the
                  attractive establishment just alluded to.</p>
               <p>"How?" asked Barclay in a tone of enquiry.</p>
               <p>"Six times a day, John, is too often for you to be seen going into the same
                  drinking-house,"—said the old man, with plain-spoken honesty.</p>
               <p>"You must not talk to me in that way, Mr. Gray," the other rejoined sternly.</p>
               <p>"My respect and regard for the father, will ever cause me to speak plainly to the
                  son when I think him in danger," was Mr. Gray's calm reply.</p>
               <p>"In danger of what, Mr. Gray?"</p>
               <p>"In danger of—shall I utter the word in speaking o' the son of my old friend, Mr.
                  Barclay? Yes; in danger of—drunkenness!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gray, I cannot permit any one to speak to me thus."</p>
               <p>"Be not offended at me, John. I utter but the truth."</p>
               <p>"I will not stand to be insulted by any one!" was the young man's angry reply, as
                  he turned suddenly away from his aged friend, and entered the drinking-house. He
                  did not go up at once to the bar, as had been his habit, but threw himself down
                  upon one of the lounges, took up a newspaper, and commenced; or rather, appeared
                  to commence reading, though he did not, in fact, see a letter.</p>
               <p>"What will you have, Mr. Barclay?" asked an officious attendant, coming up, a few
                  moments after he had entered.</p>
               <p>"Nothing just now," was the reply, made in a low tone, while his eyes were not
                  lifted from the newspaper. No very pleasant reflections were those that passed
                  through his mind as he sat there. At last he rose up quickly, as if a resolution,
                  had been suddenly formed, and left the place where clustered so many temptations,
                  with a hurried step.</p>
               <p>"I want you to administer an oath," he said, entering the office of an Alderman, a
                  few minutes after.</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir. I am ready," replied the Alderman. "What is its nature?"</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5627-00000057"/>
               <p>"I will give you the form."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"I, John Barclay, do solemnly swear, that for six months from this hour, I will
                  not taste a drop of any kind of liquor that intoxicates."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't take that oath, young man," the Alderman said.</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"You had better go and join a temperance society. Signing the pledge will be of as
                  much avail."</p>
               <p>"No—I will not sign a pledge never to drink again. I'm not going to make a mere
                  slave of myself. I'll swear off for six months."</p>
               <p>"Why not swear off perpetually, then?"</p>
               <p>"Because, as I said, I am not going to make a slave of myself. Six months of
                  total-abstinence will give me a control over myself that I do not now
                  possess."</p>
               <p>"I very much fear, sir," urged the Alderman, notwithstanding he perceived that the
                  young man was growing impatient—"and you must pardon my freedom in saying so, that
                  you will find yourself in error. If you are already so much the slave of drink as
                  to feel yourself compelled to have recourse to the solemnities of an oath to break
                  away from its bewitching power, depend upon it, that no temporary expedient of
                  this kind will be of any avail. You will, no doubt, keep your oath religiously,
                  but when its influence is withdrawn, you will find the strength of an unsupported
                  resolution as weak as ever."</p>
               <p>"I do not believe the position you take to be a true one," argued young
                  Barclay—"All I want is to get rid of present temptation, and to be freed from
                  present associations. Six months will place me beyond the reach of these, and then
                  I shall be able to do right from an internal principle, and not from mere external
                  restraint."</p>
               <p>"I see the view you take, and would not urge a word against it, did I not know so
                  many instances of individuals who have vainly opposed their resolutions against
                  the power of habit. When once an appetite for intoxicating drinks has been formed,
                  there is only one way of safety—that of taking a perpetual pledge of
                  total-abstinence. That, and that alone is the wall of sure protection. Without it,
                  you are exposed to temptations on every hand. The manly and determined effort to
                  be free will not always avail. In some weak and unsuspecting moment, the tempter
                  will steal quietly in, and all will be again lost."</p>
               <p>"It is useless, sir, to argue the point with me," Barclay replied to this. "I will
                  not now take the pledge—that is settled. I will take an oath of abstinence for six
                  months. If I can keep to it that long, I can keep from drinking always."</p>
               <p>Seeing that further argument would be useless, the Alderman said no more, but
                  proceeded to administer the oath. The young man then paid the required fee and
                  turned from the office in silence.</p>
               <p>When Alice left the room in tears, stung by the cutting rebuke of her brother, she
                  retired to her chamber with an oppressed and aching heart. She loved him tenderly.
                  They were, sister and brother, alone in the world, and, therefore, her affections
                  clung the closer to him. The struggle had been a hard one in bringing herself to
                  perform the duty which had called down upon her the anger of one for whom she
                  would almost have given her life; and, therefore, the result was doubly painful,
                  more particularly, as it had effected nothing, apparently, towards a change in his
                  habits.</p>
               <p>"But perhaps it will cause him to reflect.—If so, I will cheerfully bear his
                  anger," was the consoling thought that passed through her mind, after the passage
                  of an hour, spent under the influence of most painful feelings.</p>
               <p>"O, if he will only be more on his guard," she went on, in thought—"if he will
                  only give up that habit, how glad I should be!"</p>
               <p>Just then she heard him enter, and marked the sound of his footsteps as he
                  ascended to his own room, with a fluttering heart. In the course of fifteen or
                  twenty minutes, he went down again, and she listened to observe if he were going
                  out. But he entered the parlours, and then all was, again, quiet.</p>
               <p>For some time Alice debated with herself whether she should go down to him or not,
                  and make the effort to dispel the anger that she had aroused against her; but she
                  could not make up her mind how to act, for she could<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000058"/> not tell in what mood she might find him. One
                  repulse was as much, she felt, as she could bear. At last, however, her feelings
                  became so wrought up, that she determined to go down and seek to be reconciled.
                  Her brother's anger was more than she could bear.</p>
               <p>When she entered the parlours, with her usual quiet step, she found him seated
                  near the window, reading. He lifted his head as she came in, and she saw at a
                  glance that all his angry feelings were gone. How lightly did her heart bound as
                  she sprang forward!</p>
               <p>"Will you forgive me, brother?" she said, laying her hand upon his shoulder as she
                  stood by his side, and bent her face down until her fair cheek almost touched his
                  own.</p>
               <p>"Rather let me say, will you forgive me, sister?" was his reply, as he kissed her
                  affectionately—"for the unkind repulse I gave you, when to say what you did must
                  have caused you a most painful sacrifice of feeling?"</p>
               <p>"Painful indeed it was, brother. But it is past now and all forgiven."</p>
               <p>"Since then, Alice," he said, after a pause, "I have taken a solemn oath,
                  administered by an Alderman, not to touch any kind of intoxicating drink for six
                  months."</p>
               <p>"O, I am so glad, John!" the sister said, a joyful smile lighting up her beautiful
                  young face. "But why did you say six months? Why not for life?"</p>
               <p>"Because, Alice, I do not wish to bind myself down to a kind of perpetual slavery.
                  I wish to be free, and act right in freedom from a true principle of right. Six
                  months of entire abstinence from all kinds of liquor will destroy that appetite
                  for it which has caused me, of late, to seek it far too often. And then I will, as
                  a free man, remain free."</p>
               <p>"I shall now be so happy again, John!" Alice said, fully satisfied with her
                  brother's reason.</p>
               <p>"So you have not been happy then of late?"</p>
               <p>"O, no, brother. Far from it."</p>
               <p>"And has the fact of my using wine so freely been the cause of your
                  unhappiness?"</p>
               <p>"Solely."</p>
               <p>"Its effects upon me have not been so visible as often to attract your attention,
                  Alice?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes, they have. Scarcely a day has gone by for three or four months past, that
                  I could not see that your mind was obscured, and often your actions sensibly
                  affected."</p>
               <p>"I did not dream that it was so, Alice.'</p>
               <p>"Are you not sensible, that at Mr. Weston's, last night you were by no means
                  yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Alice, I am sensible of that, and deeply has it mortified me. I was
                  suffering acutely from the recollection of the exposure which I made of myself on
                  that occasion, especially before Helen, when you alluded to the subject. That was
                  the reason that I could not bear your allusion to it. But tell me, Alice, did you
                  perceive that my situation attracted Helen's attention particularly?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. She noticed, evidently, that you were not as you ought to have been."</p>
               <p>"How did it affect her, Alice?" asked the young man.</p>
               <p>"She seemed much pained, and, I thought, mortified."</p>
               <p>"Mortified?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>A pause of some moments ensued, when Barclay asked, in a tone of interest,</p>
               <p>"Do you think it has prejudiced her against me?"</p>
               <p>"It has evidently pained her very much, but I do not think that it has created in
                  her mind any prejudice against you."</p>
               <p>"From what do you infer this, Alice?"</p>
               <p>"From the fact, that, while we were alone in her chamber, on my going up stairs to
                  put on my bonnet and shawl, she said to me, and her eyes were moist as well as my
                  own, 'Alice, you ought to speak to your brother, and caution him against this free
                  indulgence in wine; it may grow on him, unawares. If he were as near to me as he
                  is to you, I should not feel that my conscience was clear unless I warned him of
                  his danger.'"</p>
               <p>"Did she say that, sister?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, those were her very words."</p>
               <p>"And you did warn me, faithfully."</p>
               <p>"Yes. But the task is one I pray that I may never again have to perform."</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5627-00000059"/>
               <p>"Amen," was the fervent response.</p>
               <p>"How do you like Helen?" the young man asked, in a livelier tone, after a silence
                  of nearly a minute.</p>
               <p>"I have always been attached to her, John. You know that we have been together
                  since we were little girls, until now we seem almost like sisters."</p>
               <p>"And a sister, truly, I hope she may one day become," the brother said, with a
                  meaning smile.</p>
               <p>"Most affectionately will I receive her as such," was the reply of Alice. "Than
                  Helen Weston, there is no one whom I had rather see the wife of my dear
                  brother."</p>
               <p>As she said this, she drew her arm around his neck, and kissed him
                  affectionately.</p>
               <p>"It shall not be my fault, then, Alice, if she do not become your sister—" was the
                  brother's response.</p>
               <p>Rigidly true to his pledge, John Barclay soon gained the honourable estimation in
                  the social circle through which he moved, that he had held, before wine, the
                  mocker, had seduced him from the ways of true sobriety, and caused even his best
                  friends to regard him with changed feelings. Possessing a competence, which a
                  father's patient industry had accumulated, he had not, hitherto, thought of
                  entering upon any business. Now, however, he began to see the propriety of doing
                  so, and as he had plenty of capital, he proposed to a young man of industrious
                  habits and thorough knowledge of business to enter into a co-partnership with him.
                  This offer was accepted, and the two young men commenced the world with the
                  fairest prospects.</p>
               <p>Three months from the day on which John Barclay had mentioned to his sister that
                  he entertained a regard for Helen Weston, he made proposals of marriage to that
                  young lady, which were accepted.</p>
               <p>"But how in regard to his pledge?" I hear some one ask.</p>
               <p>O, as to that, it was kept, rigidly. Nothing that could intoxicate was allowed to
                  touch his lips. Of course, he was at first frequently asked to drink by his
                  associates, but his reply to all importunities was—</p>
               <p>"No—I have sworn off for six months."</p>
               <p>"So you have said for the last six months," remarked young man, named Watson, one
                  day, on his refusing for the twentieth time to drink with him.</p>
               <p>"Not for six months, Watson. It is only three months this very day since I swore
                  off."</p>
               <p>"Well, it seems to me like six months, anyhow. But do you think that you feel any
                  better for all this total-abstinence?"</p>
               <p>"O as to that, I don't know that I feel such a wonderful difference in body; but
                  in mind I certainly do feel a great deal better."</p>
               <p>"How so?"</p>
               <p>"While I drank, I was conscious that I was beginning to be too fond of drinking,
                  and was too often painfully conscious that I had taken too much. Now, I am, of
                  course, relieved from all such unpleasant feelings."</p>
               <p>"Well, that's something, at least. But I never saw you out of the way."</p>
               <p>"Do you know the reason; Watson?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you. You were always too far gone yourself, when we drank freely
                  together, to perceive my condition."</p>
               <p>"So you say."</p>
               <p>"It's true."</p>
               <p>"Well, have it as you like. But, see here, John, what are you going to do when
                  your six months are out?"</p>
               <p>"I'm going to be a sober man, as I am now."</p>
               <p>"You never were a drunkard."</p>
               <p>"I was precious near being one, then."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! That's all some old woman's notion of yours."</p>
               <p>"Well, be that as it may, I certainly intend continuing to be as sober a man as I
                  have been for the last three months."</p>
               <p>"Won't you drink a drop after your time is up?"</p>
               <p>"That'll be just as I choose. I will drink or let it alone, as I like. I shall
                  then be free to drink moderately, or not at all, as seems agreeable to me."</p>
               <p>"That is a little more sensible than your perpetual total-abstinence, teetotal,
                  cold-water system. Who would be such a miserable slave? I would rather die drunk
                  in the gutter, than throw away my liberty."</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5627-00000060"/>
               <p>"I believe I have said as much myself."</p>
               <p>"Don't you feel a desire to have a good glass of wine, or a julep, now and
                  then?"</p>
               <p>"No, not the slightest. I've sworn off for six months, and that ends the matter.
                  Of course, I have no more desire for a glass of liquor than I have to fly to the
                  moon,—one is a moral, and the other a physical impossibility; and, therefore, are
                  dismissed from my thoughts."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by a moral impossibility?"</p>
               <p>"I have taken an oath not to drink for six months, and the violation of that oath
                  is, for one of my views and feelings, a moral impossibility."</p>
               <p>"Exactly. There are three months yet to run, you say. After that, I hope to have
                  the pleasure of taking a glass of wine with you in honour of your restoration to a
                  state of freedom."</p>
               <p>"You shall have that pleasure, Watson, if it will really be one—" was Barclay's
                  reply, as the two young men parted.</p>
               <p>Time wore on, and John Barclay, besides continuing perfectly sober, gave constant
                  attention to business. So complete a change in him gave confidence to the parents
                  and friends of Helen Weston, who made no opposition to his wish for an early
                  marriage. It was fixed to take place on the evening of the very day upon which his
                  temporary pledge was to expire.</p>
               <p>To the expiration of this pledge, Barclay had never ceased, from the moment it was
                  taken, to look forward with a lively interest. Not that he felt a desire to drink.
                  But he suffered himself to be worried with the idea that he was no longer a free
                  man. The nearer the day came that was to terminate the period for which he had
                  bound himself to abstinence, the more did his mind dwell upon it, and the more did
                  he desire its approach. It was, likewise, to be his wedding-day, and for that
                  reason, also, did he look eagerly forward. But it is doubtful whether the
                  consummation of his marriage, or the expiration of his pledge, occupied most of
                  his thoughts. The day so long looked for came at last.</p>
               <p>The day that was to make Barclay a free man, and happy in the possession of one of
                  the sweetest girls for a wife he had ever seen.</p>
               <p>"I shall not see you again, until to-night, John," his sister said to him, as he
                  was about leaving the house, after dinner, laying her hand as she spoke upon his
                  arm, and looking into his face with a quiet smile resting upon her own lovely
                  features.—"I have promised Helen to go over and spend the afternoon with her."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sis'."</p>
               <p>"Of course we shall see you pretty early,"—an arch smile playing about her lips as
                  she made the remark.</p>
               <p>"O, yes, I shall be there in time," was the brother's smiling reply, as he kissed
                  the cheek of Alice, and then turned away and left the house. He first proceeded to
                  his store, where he went through, hurriedly, some business that required his
                  attention, occupying something like an hour. Then he went out, and walked rapidly
                  up one of the principal streets of the city, and down another, as if on some
                  urgent errand. Without stopping anywhere, he had nearly returned to his own store,
                  when he was stopped by a friend, who accosted him with—</p>
               <p>"Hallo, John! Where are you going in such a hurry?"</p>
               <p>"I am on my way to the store."</p>
               <p>"Any life and death in the case?"</p>
               <p>"No.—Only I'm to be married to-night, as you are aware; and, consequently, am
                  hardly able to tell whether I am on my head or my heels."</p>
               <p>"True enough! And besides, you are a free man today, are you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Watson, thank Heaven! that trammel will be off in half an hour."</p>
               <p>"You must be fond of trammels, John, seeing that you are going to put another on
                  so soon after getting rid of this—" the friend said, laughing heartily at his
                  jest.</p>
               <p>"That will be a lighter, and far pleasanter bondage I trust, Watson, than the one
                  from which I am about escaping. It will be an easy yoke compared to the galling
                  one under which I have toiled for the last six months. Still, I do not regret
                  having bound myself as I did. It was necessary to give me that self-control which
                  I had well-nigh lost. Now I shall be able to act like a rational man, and be
                  temperate from principle, and not from a mere external restraint that made me
                  little better than a machine."</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5627-00000061"/>
               <p>"Your time will be up, you say, in half an hour?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—" looking at his watch—"in ten minutes. It is later than I thought."</p>
               <p>"Come, then, let us go over to R——'s—it is full ten minutes' walk from here—and
                  take a drink to freedom and principle."</p>
               <p>"I am ready to join you, of course," was Barclay's prompt reply, as he drew his
                  arm within that of his friend, and the two turned their steps towards the drinking
                  establishment that had been named by the latter.</p>
               <p>"A room, a bottle of sherry, and some cigars," said Watson, as they entered the
                  drinking-house, and went up to the bar.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes after, they were alone, with wine and glasses before them.</p>
               <p>"Here's to freedom and principle!" said Watson, lifting his glass, after having
                  filled his own and Barclay's.</p>
               <p>"And here's to the same high moral <choice>
                     <sic>atributes</sic>
                     <corr>attributes</corr>
                  </choice> which should ever be man's distinguishing characteristics," responded
                  Barclay, lifting his own glass, and touching with it the brim of that held in the
                  hand of his friend. Both then emptied their glasses at a draught.</p>
               <p>"Really, that is delicious!" Barclay said, smacking his lips, as the rich flavour
                  of the wine lingered on his palate with a sensation of exquisite delight.</p>
               <p>"It's a pretty fair article," was the indifferent reply of Watson—"though I have
                  tasted better in my time. Long abstinence has made its flavour peculiarly
                  pleasant. Here, let me fill your glass again."</p>
               <p>Without hesitating, Barclay presented his glass, which was again filled to the
                  brim. In the next moment it was empty. So eager was he to get it to his lips, that
                  he even spilled a portion of the wine in lifting it hurriedly. Suddenly his old,
                  and as he had thought, extinguished desires, came back upon him, roused into
                  vigorous activity, like a giant awakening refreshed by a long repose. So keen was
                  his appetite for wine, and stimulating drinks, thus suddenly restored, that he
                  could no more have withstood its influence than he could have borne up against the
                  current of a mighty river.</p>
               <p>"Help yourself," said his friend, ere another minute had elapsed, as Barclay took
                  up the bottle to fill his glass for the third time. "Long-abstinence has no doubt
                  made you keen."</p>
               <p>"It certainly has, or else this is the finest article of wine that has ever passed
                  my lips."</p>
               <p>'It's not the best quality by a good deal; still it is pretty fair. But won't you
                  try a mint-julep, or a punch, by way of variety?"</p>
               <p>"No objection," was the brief response.</p>
               <p>"Which will you choose?"</p>
               <p>"I'll take a julep."</p>
               <p>"Two juleps," said Watson to the waiter who entered immediately afterwards.</p>
               <p>The juleps were soon ready, each furnished with a long straw.</p>
               <p>"Delicious!" was Barclay's low, and delighted ejaculation, as he bent to the
                  table, and "imbibed" through the straw a portion of the liquid.</p>
               <p>"Our friend R—— understands his business," was Watson's brief reply.</p>
               <p>A silence of some moments ensued, during which a painful consciousness of danger
                  rushed through the mind of Barclay. But with an effort he dismissed it. He did not
                  intend to drink beyond the bounds of moderation, and why should he permit his mind
                  to be disturbed by idle fears? * * * * *</p>
               <p>"It is time that brother was here," Alice said to Helen Weston, as the two maidens
                  sat alone, near a window in Helen's chamber, the evening twilight falling gently
                  and with a soothing influence.</p>
               <p>"Yes. I expected him earlier," was the reply, in a low tone, while Helen's bosom
                  heaved with a new, and exquisitely pleasurable emotion. "What can keep him?"</p>
               <p>"He is lingering at his toilet, perhaps," Alice said, with a smile.</p>
               <p>All was silent again for many minutes, each gentle and innocent heart; busy with
                  images of delight.</p>
               <p>"It's strange that he does not come, Alice, or sister, as I must call you," Helen
                  remarked, in a graver tone, as the shadowy twilight deepened until everything wore
                  a veil of indistinctness.</p>
               <p>"There! That must be him!" Alice said. "Hark! That is certainly his voice! Yes—And
                  he is coming<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5627-00000062"/> right up to your room, as
                  I live, as boldly as if the house belonged to him."</p>
               <p>While Alice was yet speaking, the door of the chamber in which they sat was swung
                  open with a rude hand, and her brother entered. His face was flushed, and his
                  whole person in disorder.</p>
               <p>"Why, brother! what has kept—," but the sister could utter no more. Her tongue was
                  paralyzed, and she stood, statue-like, gazing upon him with a look of horror. He
                  was intoxicated! It was his wedding-night, a portion of the company below, and the
                  gentle, affectionate maiden who was to become his bride, all attired and waiting,
                  and he had come intoxicated!</p>
               <p>Poor Helen's bewildered senses could not at first fully comprehend the scene. When
                  she did realize the terrible truth, the shock was more than she could bear.</p>
               <p>Over the whole scene of pain, disorder, and confusion, that transpired on that
                  evening, we must draw a veil. Any reader of even ordinary imagination can realize
                  enough of the exquisite distress which it must have brought to many hearts,
                  without the aid of distinct pictures. And those who cannot realize it, will be
                  spared the pain of its contemplation.</p>
               <p>One week from that night, at about nine o'clock in the evening, as old Mr. Gray
                  was passing along one of the principal streets of the city where the occurrences
                  we are relating took place, a young man staggered against him, and then fell at
                  full length upon the pavement, from whence he rolled into the gutter, swollen by a
                  smart shower that had just fallen. Too drunk to help himself, he must have been
                  drowned even in that insignificant stream, had there not been help at hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gray came at once to his relief, and assisted him to rise and get upon the
                  pavement. But now he was unable to stand. Either hurt by the fall, or unnerved by
                  the liquor he had taken, he was no longer able to keep his feet. While Mr. Gray
                  stood holding him up, undetermined how to act, another young man, not quite so
                  drunk as the one he had in charge, came whooping along like an Indian.</p>
               <p>"Hallo! Is this you, John, holding up old Mr. Gray? or is it old Mr. Gray holding
                  you up! [hiccup.] Blast me! If I can tell which of you is drunk, or which sober.
                  Let me see? hic-hic-cup. Was it the Whale that swallowed Jonah, or Jonah the
                  Whale? Is it old Mr. Gray—hic-cup—that is drunk, or John Barclay?"</p>
               <p>"John Barclay!" ejaculated the old man, in a tone of surprise and grief. "Surely
                  this wretched young man is not John Barclay!"</p>
               <p>"If he is not John Barclay, then I am not—hic-cup—not Tom Watson. He's a bird,
                  though! aint he, old gentleman?—hic-cup—Look here, I'll give you five
                  dollars,—hic-cup—if you'll stop these,—hic—these confounded hic-hic-hic-cups—There
                  now—There's a chance for you!—hic—blast 'em! He swore off for six months, ha! ha!
                  ha! And it's just,—hic—just a week to-night since the six months were up. Hurrah
                  for freedom and principle! Hur—hic—hurrah!"</p>
               <p>"Thomas Watson!—"</p>
               <p>"Don't come your preaching touch over me, mister, if you please. I'm free Tom
                  Watson,—hic-hic-hic-cup—I'm—hic—I'm a regular team—whoop! John, there, you see,
                  would drink to freedom and principle,—hic-cup—on the—hic—day his pledge was up.
                  But the old fellow was—hic—too strong—hic-cup—for him. He's been drunk as a fool
                  ever since—hic-cup!—"</p>
               <p>Just at that moment a cab came by which was stopped by the old man. Young Barclay
                  was gotten into it and driven to Mr. Gray's dwelling.</p>
               <p>When brought to the light, he presented a sad spectacle, indeed. His face was
                  swollen, and every feature distorted. His coat was torn, and all of his clothing
                  wet and covered with mud. Too far gone to be able to help himself, Mr. Gray had
                  him removed to a chamber, his wet garments taken off, and replaced by dry
                  under-clothing. Then he was put into a bed and left for the night. When the
                  morning broke, Barclay was perfectly sober, but with a mind altogether bewildered.
                  The room in which he found himself, and the furniture, were all strange. He got
                  up; and looked from the window; the houses opposite were unfamiliar.</p>
               <p>"Where am I? What is the meaning of all this?" he said, half-aloud, as he turned
                  to look for his clothes. But<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5627-00000063"/> no
                  garments of any kind, not even his hat and boots, were visible.</p>
               <p>"Strange!" he murmured, getting into bed again, and clasping his hands tightly
                  upon his aching and bewildered head. He had lain, thus, for some minutes, trying
                  to collect his scattered senses, when the door of his chamber was opened by a
                  servant, who brought him in a full suit of his own clothes; not, however, those he
                  remembered to have worn the day previous.</p>
               <p>As soon as the servant had withdrawn, the young man, who had felt altogether
                  disinclined to speak to him, hurriedly arose, and dressed himself. On attempting
                  to go out, he was surprised, and somewhat angered, to find that the door of the
                  room had been locked.</p>
               <p>Ringing the bell with a quick jerk, he awaited, impatiently, an answer to his
                  summons, for the space of about a minute, when he pulled the cord again with a
                  stronger hand. Only a few moments more elapsed, when the key was turned in the
                  door, and Mr. Gray entered.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gray! Is it possible!" Barclay ejaculated, as the old man stepped into the
                  room, and closed the door after him.</p>
               <p>"I can hardly believe it possible, John," his father's friend said, as he turned
                  towards him a sad, yet unreproving countenance.</p>
               <p>"But what is the meaning of all this, Mr. Gray? Where am I? And how came I
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"Sit down, John, and be calm. You are in my house. Last night I took you from the
                  gutter, too much intoxicated to help yourself. You would have drowned there, in
                  three inches of water, had not a friendly hand been near to save you."</p>
               <p>"Dreadful!" ejaculated the young man, striking his hand hard against his forehead,
                  while an expression of shame and agonizing remorse passed over his face.</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed, dreadful to think of, my young friend!" Mr. Gray remarked, in a
                  sympathizing tone. "How wretched you must be!"</p>
               <p>"Wretched? Alas! sit, you cannot imagine the horror of this dreadful moment.
                  Surely I have been mad for the past few days! And enough has occurred to drive me
                  mad."</p>
               <p>"So I should think, John. But that is past now, and the future is still yours, and
                  its bright page still unsullied by a single act of folly."</p>
               <p>"But the past! The dreadful past! That can never be recalled—never be atoned for,"
                  Barclay replied, his countenance bearing the strongest expression of anguish and
                  remorse. "To think of all I have lost To think how cruelly I have mocked the
                  fondest hopes, and crushed the purest affections—perhaps broken a loving heart by
                  my folly. O, sir! It will drive me mad!"</p>
               <p>As the young man said this, he arose to his feet, and commenced pacing the room to
                  and fro with agitated steps. Now striking his hands against his forehead, and now
                  wringing them violently.</p>
               <p>"Since that accursed hour," he resumed, after a few minutes thus spent, "when I
                  madly tempted myself, under the belief that I had gained the mastery over a
                  depraved appetite by an abstinence from all kinds of liquor for six months, I have
                  but a dim recollection of events. I do, indeed, remember, with tolerable
                  distinctness, that I went to claim the hand of Helen Weston, according to
                  appointment. But from the moment I entered the house, all is to me confusion, or a
                  dead blank. Tell me, then, Mr. Gray,"—and the young man's voice grew calmer,—"the
                  effect of my miserable conduct upon her whom I loved purely and tenderly. Let me
                  know all. I ask no disguise."</p>
               <p>"The effect, John, has been painful, indeed. Since that dreadful night, she has
                  remained in a state of partial delirium. But her physician told me, yesterday,
                  that all of her symptoms had become more favourable."</p>
               <p>"And how is her father, and friends?"</p>
               <p>"Deeply incensed, of course, at your conduct."</p>
               <p>"And my sister? How is Alice?"</p>
               <p>"She keeps up with an effort. But oh, how wretched and broken-hearted she looks!
                  Is it not dreadful, John, to think, how, by a single act of folly, you have
                  lacerated the hearts that loved you most, and imposed upon them burdens of
                  anguish, almost too heavy to be borne?"</p>
               <p>"It is dreadful! dreadful! O, that I had died, before I became an accursed
                  instrument of evil to those I love.<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5627-00000064"/> But
                  what can I do, Mr. Gray, to atone, in some degree, for the misery I have
                  wrought?"</p>
               <p>"You can do much, John, if you will."</p>
               <p>"If I will, Mr. Gray?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, John, if you will."</p>
               <p>"There is nothing that I am not ready to do, Mr. Gray—even the cutting off of my
                  right hand, could it be of any avail."</p>
               <p>"You swore off, as I believe you called it, for six months, did you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Had you any desire to drink, during that time?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>"Sign a pledge of perpetual total-abstinence, and you are safe from all future
                  temptations. Time will doubtless heal the present painful wounds."</p>
               <p>"And make a slave of myself, Mr. Gray. Surely I ought to have power enough over
                  myself to abstain from all intoxicating drinks, without binding myself down by a
                  written contract."</p>
               <p>"That is true; but, unfortunately, you have not that control over yourself. Your
                  only safety, then, lies in the pledge. Take that, and you throw between yourself
                  and danger an insurmountable barrier. You talk about freedom; and yet are a slave
                  to the most debasing appetite. Get free from the influence of that eager,
                  insatiable desire, and you are free, indeed. The perpetual total-abstinence pledge
                  will be your declaration of independence. When that is taken, you. will be free,
                  indeed. And until it is taken, rest assured, that none of your friends will again
                  have confidence in you. For their sakes,—for your sister's sake, that peace may
                  once more be restored to her troubled heart—for the sake of her, from whose lip
                  you dashed the cup of joy, sign the pledge."</p>
               <p>"I will sign it, Mr. Gray. But name not her whom I have so deeply wronged. I can
                  never see Helen Weston again."</p>
               <p>"Time heals many a wound, and closes many a breach my young friend."</p>
               <p>"It can never heal that wound, nor close that breach," was the sad response. "But
                  give me a pen and ink, and some paper; and let me write a pledge. I believe it is
                  necessary for me to sign one."</p>
               <p>The materials for writing were brought as desired, and Barclay wrote and
                  subscribed a pledge of perpetual abstinence from all that could intoxicate.</p>
               <p>"That danger is past," he said, with a lighter tone, as he arose from the table at
                  which he had been writing. "I can never pass another such a week as that which has
                  just elapsed."</p>
               <p>"Now come down and take a good warm breakfast with me," Mr. Gray said, in a
                  cheerful voice.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me if you please," Barclay replied. "I cannot meet your family this
                  morning, after what has occurred. Besides, I must see my sister as quickly as
                  possible, and relieve, as far as lies in my power, her suffering heart."</p>
               <p>"Go then, John Barclay," the old man said. "I will not, for Alice's sake, urge you
                  to linger a moment."</p>
               <p>It was still early when Mr. Barclay entered his own home. He found Alice sitting
                  in the parlour so pale, haggard, and wretched, that her features hardly seemed
                  like those of his own sister. She looked up into his face as he came in with a
                  sad, doubting expression, while her lips trembled. One glance, however, told her
                  heart that a change had taken place, and she sprang quickly towards him.</p>
               <p>"Alice, my own dear sister!" he said, as her head sank upon his breast. "The
                  struggle is over. I am free once more, and free for ever. I have just signed a
                  pledge of total-abstinence from all that can intoxicate—a pledge that will remain
                  perpetually in force."</p>
               <p>"And may our Father in Heaven help you to keep it, John," the maiden murmured, in
                  a low, fervent tone.</p>
               <p>"I will die before it shall be violated," was the stern response.</p>
               <milestone n="*    *    *    *    *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>One year from that time, another bridal party assembled at the residence of Mr.
                  Weston. Helen long since recovered from the shock she had received, had again
                  consented to be led to the altar, by John Barclay, whose life had been, since he
                  signed the pledge, of the most unexceptionable character. Indeed, almost his
                     only<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5627-00000065"/> fault in former times had been
                  a fondness for drinking, and gay company. Not much of boisterous mirth
                  characterized the bridal party, for none felt like giving way to an exuberance of
                  feeling,—but there was, notwithstanding few could draw a veil entirely over the
                  past, a rational conviction that true and permanent happiness must, and would
                  crown that marriage union. And thus far, it has followed it, and must continue to
                  follow it, for John Barclay is a man of high-toned principle, and would as soon
                  think of committing a highway robbery, as violating his pledge.</p>

               <head>THE FAILING HOPE.</head>
               <p>"SHALL I read to you, ma?" said Emma Martin, a little girl, eleven years of age,
                  coming up to the side of her mother, who sat in a musing attitude by the
                  centre-table, upon which the servant had just placed a light.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin did not seem to hear the voice of her child; for she moved not, nor
                  was there any change in the fixed, dreamy expression of her face.</p>
               <p>"Ma," repeated the child, after waiting for a few moments, laying, at the same
                  time, her head gently upon her mother's shoulder.</p>
               <p>"What, dear?" Mrs. Martin asked, in a tender voice, rousing herself up.</p>
               <p>"Shall I read to you, ma?" repeated the child.</p>
               <p>"No—yes, dear, you may read for me"—the mother said, and her tones were low, with
                  something mournful in their expression.</p>
               <p>"What shall I read, ma?"</p>
               <p>"Get the Bible, dear, and read to me from that good book," replied Mrs.
                  Martin.</p>
               <p>"I love to read in the Bible," Emma said, as she brought to the centre-table that
                  sacred volume, and commenced turning over its pages. She then read chapter after
                  chapter, while the mother listened in deep attention, often lifting her heart
                  upwards, and breathing a silent prayer. At last Emma grew tired with reading, and
                  closed the book.</p>
               <p>"It is time for you to go to bed, dear," Mrs. Martin observed, as the little girl
                  showed signs of weariness.</p>
               <p>"Kiss me, ma," the child said, lifting her innocent face to that of her mother,
                  and receiving the token of love she asked. Then, breathing her gentle,</p>
               <p>"Good-night!" the affectionate girl glided off, and retired to her chamber.</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5627-00000066"/>
               <p>"Dear child!" Mrs. Martin murmured, as Emma left the room. "My heart trembles when
                  I think of you, and look into the dark and doubtful future!"</p>
               <p>She then leaned her head upon her hand, and sat in deep, and evidently painful
                  abstraction of mind. Thus she remained for a long time, until aroused by the clock
                  which struck the hour of ten.</p>
               <p>With a deep sigh she arose, and commenced pacing the room backwards and forwards,
                  pausing every now and then to listen to the sound of approaching footsteps, and
                  moving on again as the sound went by. Thus she continued to walk until nigh eleven
                  o'clock, when some one drew near, paused at the street door, and then opening it,
                  came along the passage with a firm and steady step.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin stopped, trembling in spite of herself, before the parlour door, which
                  a moment after was swung open. One glance at the face of the individual who
                  entered, convinced her that her solicitude had been unnecessary.</p>
               <p>"Oh, James!" she said, the tears gushing from her eyes, in spite of a strong
                  effort to compose herself,—"I am so glad that you have come!"</p>
               <p>"Why are you so agitated, Emma?" her husband said, in some surprise, looking
                  inquiringly into Mrs. Martin's face.</p>
               <p>"You staid out so late—and—you know I am foolish sometimes!" she replied, leaning
                  her head down upon his shoulder, and continuing to weep.</p>
               <p>A change instantly passed upon Mr. Martin's countenance, and he stood still, for
                  some time, his face wearing a grave thoughtful expression, while his wife remained
                  with her head leaning upon him. At last he drew his arm tenderly around her, and
                  said—</p>
               <p>"Emma, I am a sober man."</p>
               <p>"Do not, dear James! speak of that. I am so happy now!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Emma, I will speak of it now." And as he said so, he gently seated her upon
                  the sofa, and took his place beside her.</p>
               <p>"Emma"—he resumed, looking her steadily in the face. "I have resolved never again
                  to touch the accursed cup that has so well-nigh destroyed our peace for ever."</p>
               <p>"Oh, James! What a mountain you have taken from my heart!" Mrs. Martin replied,
                  the whole expression of her face changing as suddenly as a landscape upon which
                  the sun shines from beneath an obscuring cloud. "I have had nothing to trouble me
                  but that —yet that one trouble has seemed more than I could possibly bear."</p>
               <p>"You shall have no more trouble, Emma. I have been for some months under a strange
                  delusion, it has seemed. But I am now fully awake, and see the dangerous precipice
                  upon which I have been standing. This night, I have solemnly resolved that I would
                  drink no more spirituous liquors. Nothing stronger than wine shall again pass my
                  lips."</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell you how my heart is relieved," the wife said. "The whole of this
                  evening I have been painfully oppressed with fear and dark forebodings. Our dear
                  little girl is now at that age, when her future prospects interest me all the
                  while. I think of them night and day. Shall they all be marred? I have asked
                  myself often and often. But I could give my heart no certain answer. I need not
                  tell you why."</p>
               <p>"Give yourself no more anxiety on this point, Emma," her husband replied. "I will
                  be a free man again. I will be to you and my dear child all that I have ever
                  been."</p>
               <p>"May our Heavenly Father aid you to keep that resolution," was the silent prayer
                  that went up from the heart of Mrs. Martin.</p>
               <p>The failing hope of. her bosom revived under this assurance. She felt again as in
                  the early years of their wedded life, when hope and confidence, and tender
                  affection were all in the bloom and vigour of their first developement. The light
                  came back to her eye, and the smile to her lip.</p>
               <p>It was about four months afterwards, that Mr. Martin was invited to make one of a
                  small party, given to a literary man, as visiter from a neighbouring city.</p>
               <p>"I shall not be home to dinner, Emma," he said, on leaving in the morning.</p>
               <p>"Why not, James?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I am going to dine at four, with a select party of gentlemen."</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5627-00000067"/>
               <p>Mrs. Martin did not reply, but a cloud passed over her face, in spite of an effort
                  not to seem concerned.</p>
               <p>"Don't be uneasy, Emma," her husband said, noting this change. "I shall touch
                  nothing but wine. I know my weakness, and shall be on my guard."</p>
               <p>"Do be watchful over yourself, for my sake, and for the sake of our own dear
                  child," Mrs. Martin replied, laying her arm tenderly upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Have no fear, Emma," he said, and kissing the yet fair and beautiful cheek of his
                  wife, Mr. Martin left the house.</p>
               <p>How long, how very long did the day seem to Mrs. Martin! The usual hour for his
                  return came and went, the dinner hardly tasted; and then his wife counted the
                  hours as they passed lingeringly away, until the dim, grey twilight fell with a
                  saddening influence around her.</p>
               <p>"He will be home soon, now," she thought. But the minutes glided into hours, and
                  still he did not come. The tea-table stood in the floor until nearly nine o'clock,
                  before Mrs. Martin sat down with little Emma. But no food passed the mother's
                  lips. She could not eat. There was a strange fear about her heart—a dread of
                  coming evil, that chilled her feelings, and threw a dark cloud over her
                  spirits.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, Martin had gone to the dinner-party, firm in his resolution not
                  to touch a drop of ardent spirits. But the taste of wine had inflamed his
                  appetite, and he drank more and more freely, until he ceased to feel the power of
                  his resolution, and again put brandy to his lips, and drank with the eagerness of
                  a worn and thirsty traveller at a cooling brook. It was nine o'clock when the
                  company arose, or rather attempted to arise from the table. Not all of them could
                  accomplish that feat. Three, Martin among the rest, were carried off to bed, in a
                  state of helpless intoxication.</p>
               <p>Hour after hour passed away, the anxiety of Mrs. Martin increasing every moment,
                  until the clock struck twelve.</p>
               <p>"Why does he stay so late?" she said, rising and pacing the room backwards and
                  forwards. This she continued to do, pausing every now and then to listen, for
                  nearly an hour. Then she went to the door and looked ed long and anxiously in the
                  direction from which she expected her husband to come. But his well-known form met
                  not her eager eyes, that peered so intently into the darkness and gloom of the
                  night. With another long-drawn sigh, she closed the door, and re-entered the
                  silent and lonely room. That silence was broken by the loud and clear ringing of
                  the clock. The hour was one! Mrs. Martin's feelings now became too much excited
                  for her to control them. She sank into a chair, and wept in silent anguish of
                  spirit. For nearly a quarter of an hour her tears continued to flow, and then a
                  deep calm succeeded—a kind of mental stupor, that remained until she was startled
                  again into distinct consciousness by the sound of the clock striking two.</p>
               <p>All hope now faded from her bosom. Up to this time she had entertained a feeble
                  expectation that her husband might be kept away from some other cause than the one
                  she so dreaded; but now that prop became only as a broken reed, to pierce her with
                  a keener anguish.</p>
               <p>"It is all over!" she murmured bitterly, as she again arose, and commenced,
                  walking to and fro with slow and measured steps.</p>
               <p>It was fully three o'clock before that lonely, and almost heart-broken wife and
                  mother retired to her chamber. How cruelly had the hope which had grown bright and
                  buoyant in the last few months, gaining more strength and confidence every day,
                  been again crushed to the earth!</p>
               <p>For an hour longer did Mrs. Martin sit, listening in her chamber, everything
                  around her so hushed into oppressive silence, that the troubled beating of her own
                  heart, was distinctly audible. But she waited and listened in vain. The sound of
                  passing footsteps that now came only at long, very long intervals, served but to
                  arouse a momentary gleam in her mind, to fade away again, and leave it in deeper
                  darkness.</p>
               <p>Without disrobing, she now laid herself down, still listening, with an anxiety
                  that grew more and more intense every moment. At last, over-wearied nature could
                  bear up no longer, and she sunk into a troubled sleep. When she awoke from this,
                  it was daylight. Oh, how weary and worn and wretched she felt! The consciousness
                     of<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5627-00000068"/> why she thus lay, with her
                  clothes unremoved, the sad remembrance of her hours of waiting and watching
                  through nearly the whole night, all came up before her with painful distinctness.
                  Who but she who has suffered, can imagine her feelings at that bitter moment?</p>
               <p>On descending to the parlour, she found her husband lying in a half-stupid
                  condition on the sofa, the close air of the room impregnated with his breath—the
                  sickening, disgusting breath of a drunken man! Bruised, crushed, paralyzed
                  affection had now to lift itself up—the wife just ready to sink to the earth,
                  powerless, under the weight of an overburdening affliction, had now to nerve
                  herself under the impulse of duty.</p>
               <p>"James! James!" she said, in a voice of assumed calmness—laying her hand upon him
                  and endeavouring to arouse him to consciousness. But it was a long time before she
                  could get him so fully awake as to make him understand that it was necessary for
                  him to go up stairs and retire to bed. At length she succeeded in getting him into
                  his chamber before the servants had come down; and then into bed. Once there, he
                  fell off again into a profound sleep.</p>
               <p>"Is pa sick?" asked little Emma, coming into her mother's chamber, about an hour
                  after, and seeing her father in bed.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear, your father is quite unwell!" Mrs. Martin said, in a calm voice.</p>
               <p>"What ails him, ma?" pursued the child.</p>
               <p>"He is not very well, dear; but will be better soon," the mother said,
                  evasively.</p>
               <p>The little girl looked into her mother's face for a few moments unsatisfied with
                  the answer, and unwilling to ask another question. She felt that something was
                  wrong, more than the simple illness of her father.</p>
               <p>It was near the middle of the day when Mr. Martin became fully awake and conscious
                  of his condition. If he had sought forgetfulness of the past night's debauch and
                  degradation, the sad, reproving face of his wife, pale and languid from anxiety
                  and watching, would too quickly have restored the memory of his fall.</p>
               <p>The very bitterness of his self-condemnation—the very keenness of wounded pride
                  irritated his feelings, and made him feel gloomy and sullen. He felt deeply for
                  his suffering wife—he wished most ardently to speak to her a word of comfort, but
                  his pride kept him silent. At the dinner hour, he eat a few mouthfuls in silence,
                  and then withdrew from the table and left the house to attend to his ordinary
                  business. On his way to his office, he passed a hotel where he had been in the
                  habit of drinking. He felt so wretched—so much in want of something to buoy up his
                  depressed feelings, that he entered, and calling for some wine, drank two or three
                  glasses. This, in a few minutes, had the desired effect, and he repaired to his
                  office feeling like a new man.</p>
               <p>During the afternoon, he drank wine frequently; and when he returned home in the
                  evening, was a good deal under its influence; so much so, that all the reserve he
                  had felt in the morning was gone. He spoke pleasantly and freely with his
                  wife—talked of future schemes of pleasure and success. But, alas! his pleasant
                  words fell upon her heart like sunshine upon ice. It was too painfully evident
                  that he had again been drinking—and drinking to the extent of making him
                  altogether unconscious of his true position. She would rather a thousand times
                  have seen him overwhelmed by remorse. Then there would have been something for her
                  hope to have leaned upon.</p>
               <p>Day after day did Mr. Martin continue to resort to the wine-cup. Every morning he
                  felt so wretched that existence seemed a burden to him, until his keen perceptions
                  were blunted by wine. Then the appetite for something stronger would be
                  stimulated, and draught after draught of brandy would follow, until when night
                  came, he would return home to agonize the heart of his wife with a new pang,
                  keener than any that had gone before.</p>
               <p>Such a course of conduct could not be pursued without its becoming apparent to all
                  in the house. Mrs. Martin had, therefore, added to the cup of sorrow, the
                  mortification and pain of having the servants, and her child daily conscious of
                  his degradation. Poor little Emma would shrink away instinctively from her father
                  when he would return home in the evening and endeavour to lavish upon her his
                  caresses. Sometimes Mr. Martin would get irritated at this.</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5627-00000069"/>
               <p>"What are you sidling off in that way for, Emma?" he said, half-angrily, one
                  evening, when he was more than usually under the influence of liquor, as Emma
                  shrunk away from him on his coming in.</p>
               <p>The little girl paused and looked frightened—glancing first at her mother, and
                  then again, timidly, at her father.</p>
               <p>"Come along here, I say," repeated the father, seating himself, and holding out
                  his hands.</p>
               <p>"Go, dear," Mrs. Martin said.</p>
               <p>"I reckon she can come without you telling her to, madam!" her husband responded,
                  angrily. "Come along, I tell you!" he added in a loud, excited tone, his face
                  growing red with passion.</p>
               <p>"There now! Why didn't you come when I first spoke. to you, ha?" he said, drawing
                  the child towards him with a quick jerk, so soon as she came within reach of his
                  extended hand. "Say. Why didn't you come Tell me! Aint I your father?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," was the timid reply.</p>
               <p>"And havn't I taught you that you must obey me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then why didn't you come, just now, when I called you?"</p>
               <p>To this interrogation the little girl made no reply, but looked exceedingly
                  frightened.</p>
               <p>"Did you hear what I said?" pursued the father, in a louder voice.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then answer me, this instant! Why didn't you come when I called you?"</p>
               <p>"Because, I—I—I was afraid," was the timid, hesitating reply.</p>
               <p>Something seemed to whisper to the father's mind a consciousness, that his
                  appearance and conduct while under the influence of liquor, might be such as not
                  only to frighten, but estrange his child's affection from him; and he seemed
                  touched by the thought, for his manner changed, though he was still to a degree
                  irrational.</p>
               <p>"Go away, then, Emma! Take her away, mother," he said, in a tone which indicated
                  that his feelings were touched. "She don't love her father any more, and don't
                  care anything more about him," pushing at the same time the child away from
                  him.</p>
               <p>Poor little Emma burst into tears, and shrinking to the side of her mother, buried
                  her face in the folds of her dress, sobbing as if her heart were breaking.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin took her little girl by the hand and led her from the room, up to the
                  chamber, and kissing her, told her to remain there until the servant brought her
                  some supper, when she could go to bed.</p>
               <p>"I don't want any supper, ma!" she said, still sobbing.</p>
               <p>"Don't cry, dear," Mrs. Martin said, soothingly.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, ma, I do love father," the child said—looking up earnestly into her
                  mother's face, the tears still streaming over her cheeks. "Won't you tell him
                  so?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Emma, I will tell him," the mother replied.</p>
               <p>"And won't you ask him to come up and kiss me after I'm in bed?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear."</p>
               <p>"And will he come?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; he will come and kiss you."</p>
               <p>Martin remained with her little girl until her feelings were quieted down, and
                  then she descended with reluctant steps to the parlour. There was that in the
                  scene which had just passed, that sobered, to a great extent, the half-intoxicated
                  husband and father, and caused him to feel humbled and pained at his conduct;
                  which it was too apparent was breaking the heart of his wife, and estranging the
                  affection of his child.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Martin re-entered the parlour, she found him sitting near a table, with
                  his head resting upon his hand, and his whole manner indicating a state of painful
                  self-consciousness. With the instinctive perception of a woman, she saw the truth;
                  and going at once up to him, she laid her hand upon him, and said:</p>
               <p>"James—Emma wants you to come up and kiss her after she gets into bed. She says
                  that she does love you, and she wished me to tell you so."</p>
               <p>Mr. Martin did not reply. There was something calm, gentle, and affectionate, in
                  the manner and tones of his wife—something that melted him completely down. A
                  choking sob followed; when he arose hastily, and retired<pb
                     n="138 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5627-00000070"/> to his chamber. Mrs. Martin
                  did not follow him thither. She saw that his own reflections were doing more for
                  him than anything that she could do or say; and, therefore, she deemed it the part
                  of wisdom to let his own reflections be his companion, and do their own work.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Martin entered his chamber, he seated himself near the bed, and leaned
                  his head down upon it. He was becoming more and more sobered every moment—more and
                  more distinctly conscious of the true nature of the ground he occupied. Still his
                  mind was a good deal confused, for the physical action of the stimulus he had
                  taken through the day, had not yet subsided; although there was a strong mental
                  counteracting cause in operation, which was gradually subduing the effect of his
                  potations. As he sat thus, leaning his head upon his hand, and half-reclining upon
                  the bed, a deep sigh, or half-suppressed sob, caught his ear. It came from the
                  adjoining chamber. He remembered his child in an instant. His only child—whom he
                  most fondly loved. He remembered, too, her conduct, but a short time before, and
                  saw, with painful distinctness, that he was estranging from himself, and bringing
                  sorrow upon one whose gentle nature had affected even his heart with feelings of
                  peculiar tenderness.</p>
               <p>"My dear child!" he murmured, as he arose to his feet, and went quietly into her
                  room. She had already retired to bed, and lay with her head almost buried beneath
                  the clothes, as if shrinking away with a sensation akin to fear. But she heard him
                  enter, and instantly rose up, saying, as she saw him approach her bed—</p>
               <p>"O, pa, indeed I do love you!"</p>
               <p>"And I love you, my child," Mr. Martin responded, bending over her and kissing her
                  forehead, cheeks, and lips, with an earnest fondness.</p>
               <p>"And don't you love ma, too?" inquired Emma.</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do, my dear! Why do you ask me?"</p>
               <p>"Because I see her crying so often—almost every day. And she seems so troubled
                  just before you come home, every evening. She didn't use to be so. A good while
                  ago, she used to be always talking about when pa would be home; and used to dress
                  me up every afternoon to see you. But now she never says anything about your coming<figure>

                  <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5627-00000071"/> ing home at night. Don't you know how
                  we used to walk out and meet you sometimes? We never do it now!"</p>
               <p>This innocent appeal was like an arrow piercing him with the most acute pain. He
                  could not find words in which to fame a reply. Simply kissing her again, and
                  bidding her a tender good-night, he turned away and left her chamber, feeling more
                  wretched than he had ever felt in his life.</p>
               <p>It was about twelve years since the wife of Mr. Martin had united her hopes and
                  affections with his. At that time he was esteemed by all—a strictly temperate man,
                  although he would drink with a friend, or at a convivial party, whenever
                  circumstances led him to do so. From this kind of indulgence the appetite for
                  liquor was formed. Two years after his marriage, Martin had become so fond of
                  drinking, that he took from two to three glasses every day, regularly. Brandy at
                  dinner-time was indispensable. The meal would have seemed to him wanting in a
                  principal article without it. It was not until about five years after their
                  marriage that Mrs. Martin was aroused to a distinct consciousness of danger. Her
                  husband came home so much intoxicated as to be scarcely able to get up into his
                  chamber. Then she remembered, but too vividly, the slow, but sure progress he had
                  been making towards intemperance, during the past two or three years, and her
                  heart sunk trembling in her bosom with a new and awful fear. It seemed as if she
                  had suddenly awakened from a delusive dream of happiness and security, to find
                  herself standing at the brink of a fearful precipice.</p>
               <p>"What can I do? What shall I do?" were questions repeated over and over again;
                  but, alas! she could find no answer upon which her troubled heart could repose
                  with confidence. How could she approach her husband upon such a subject? She felt
                  that she could not allude to it.</p>
               <p>Month after month, and year after year, she watched with an anguish of spirit that
                  paled her cheek, and stole away the brightness from her eye, the slow, but sure
                  progress of the destroyer. Alas! how did hope fail—fail—fail, until it lived in
                  her bosom but a faint, feeble, flickering ray. At last she ventured to
                  remonstrate, and met<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5627-00000072"/> with anger and
                  repulse. When this subsided, and her husband began to reflect more deeply upon his
                  course, he was humbled in spirit, and sought to heal the wound his conduct and his
                  words had made. Then came promises of amendment, and Mrs. Martin fondly hoped all
                  would be well again. The light again came back to her heart. But it did not long
                  remain. Martin still permitted himself to indulge in wine, which soon excited the
                  desire for stronger stimulants, and he again indulged, and again fell.</p>
               <p>Ten times had he thus fallen, each time repenting, and each time restoring a
                  degree of confidence to the heart of his wife, by promises of future abstinence.
                  Gradually did hope continue to grow weaker and weaker, at each relapse, until it
                  had nearly failed.</p>
               <p>"There is no hope," she said to herself, mournfully, as she sat in deep thought,
                  on the evening in which occurred the scene we have just described. "He has tried
                  so often, and fallen again at every effort. There is no hope—no hope!"</p>
               <p>It was an hour after Mr. Martin had retired to his chamber, that his wife went up
                  softly, and first went into Emma's room. The child was asleep, and there was on
                  her innocent face a quiet smile, as if pleasant images were resting upon her mind.
                  A soft kiss was imprinted on her fair forehead, and then Mrs. Martin went into her
                  own chamber. She found that her husband had retired to bed and was asleep.</p>
               <p>But few hours of refreshing slumber visited the eyelids of the almost despairing
                  wife. Towards morning, however, she sank away into a deep sleep. When she awoke
                  from this, it was an hour after daylight. Her husband was up and dressed, and sat
                  beside the bed, looking into her face with an expression of subdued, but calm and
                  tender affection.</p>
               <p>"Emma," he said, taking her hand, as soon as she was fairly awakened, "can you
                  again have confidence in me, or has hope failed altogether?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martin did not reply, but looked at her husband steadily and inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"I understand you," he said, "you have almost, if not altogether ceased to hope. I
                  do not wonder at it. If I had not so often mocked your generous confidence, I
                  would again assure you that all will be well. I see that what I say does not make
                  the warm blood bound to your face, as once it did. I will not use idle words to
                  convince you. But one thing I will say. I have been, for sometime past, conscious,
                  that it was dangerous for me to touch wine, or ale, or anything that stimulates,
                  as they do. They only revive an appetite for stronger drinks, while they take away
                  a measure of self-control. I have, therefore, most solemnly promised myself, that
                  I will never again touch or taste any spirituous liquors, wine, malt, or cider.
                  Nor will I again attend any convivial parties, where these things are used.
                  Hereafter, I shall act upon the total-abstinence principle—for only in
                  total-abstinence, is there safety for one like me."</p>
               <p>There was something so solemn and earnest in the manner of her husband, that Mrs.
                  Martin's drooping spirits began to revive. Again did her eye brighten, and her
                  cheek kindle. Then came a gush of tears attesting the power of a new impulse. The
                  failing hope was renewed!</p>
               <p>And day after day, week after week, and month after month, did that hope
                  strengthen and gain confidence. Years have passed, since that total-abstinence
                  resolution was taken, and not once during the time has Martin been tempted to
                  violate it. Yet, is he vividly conscious, that only in
                     <emph>total-abstinence</emph> from everything that can intoxicate is there
                  safety for him.</p>

               <head>TAKING TOLL.</head>
               <p>MR. SMITH kept a drug shop in the little village of Q——, which was situated a few
                  miles from Lancaster. It was his custom to visit the latter place every week or
                  two, in order to purchase such articles as were needed from time to time in his
                  business. One day, he drove off towards Lancaster, in his wagon, in which, among
                  other things, was a gallon demijohn. On reaching the town, he called first at a
                  grocer's with the inquiry,</p>
               <p>"Have you any common wine?"</p>
               <p>"How common?" asked the grocer.</p>
               <p>"About a dollar a gallon. I want it for antimonial wine."</p>
               <p>"Yes; I have some just fit for that, and not much else, which I will sell at a
                  dollar."</p>
               <p>"Very well. Give me a gallon," said Mr. Smith. The demijohn was brought in from
                  the wagon and filled. And then Mr. Smith drove off to attend to other business.
                  Among the things to be done on that day, was to see a man who lived half a mile
                  from Lancaster. Before going out on this errand, Mr. Smith stopped at the house of
                  his particular friend, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones happened not to be in, but Mrs. Jones
                  was a pleasant woman, and he chatted with her for ten minutes, or so. As he
                  stepped into his wagon, it struck him that the gallon demijohn was a little in his
                  way, and so, lifting it out, he said to Mrs. Jones,</p>
               <p>"I wish you would take care of this until I come back."</p>
               <p>"O! certainly," replied Mrs. Jones, "with the greatest pleasure."</p>
               <p>And so the demijohn was left in the lady's care.</p>
               <p>Some time afterwards Mr. Jones came in, and among the first things that attracted
                  his attention, was the strange demijohn.</p>
               <p>"What is this?" was his natural inquiry.</p>
               <p>"Something that Mr. Smith left."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Smith from Q——?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"I wonder what he has here?" said Mr. Jones, taking hold of the demijohn. "It
                  feels heavy."</p>
               <p>The cork was unhesitatingly removed, and the mouth of the vessel brought in
                  contact with the smelling organ of Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>"Wine, as I live!" fell from his lips. "Bring me a glass."</p>
               <p>"O! no, Mr. Jones. I wouldn't touch his wine," said Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>"Bring me a glass. Do you think I'm going to let a gallon of wine pass my way
                  without exacting toll? No—no! Bring me a glass."</p>
               <p>The glass, a half-pint tumbler, was produced, and nearly filled with the execrable
                  stuff—as guiltless of grape juice as a dyer's vat—which was poured down the throat
                  of Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>"Pretty fair wine, that; only a little rough," said Mr. Jones, smacking his
                  lips.</p>
               <p>"It's a shame!" remarked Mrs. Jones, warmly, "for you to do so."</p>
               <p>"I only took toll," said the husband, laughing. "No harm in that, I'm sure."</p>
               <p>"Rather heavy toll, it strikes me," replied Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>Meantime, Mr. Smith, having completed most of his business for that day, stopped
                  at a store where he wished two or three articles put up. While these were in
                  preparation he said to the keeper of the store,</p>
               <p>"I wish you would let your lad Tom step over for me to Mr. Jones's. I left a
                  demijohn of common wine there, which I bought for the purpose of making it into
                  antimonial wine.</p>
               <p>"O! certainly," replied the store-keeper. "Here, Tom!" and he called for his
                  boy.</p>
               <p>Tom came, and the store-keeper said to him,</p>
               <p>"Run over to Mr. Jones's and get a jug of antimonial wine which Mr. Smith left
                  there. Go quickly, for Mr. Smith is in a hurry."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied the lad, and away he ran.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Jones had disposed of his half a pint of wine, he thought his stomach
                  had rather a curious sensation,<pb n="144-147" xml:id="VAC5627-00000074"/> which
                  is not much to be wondered at, considering the stuff with which he had burdened
                  it.</p>
               <p>"I wonder if that really is wine?" said he, turning from the window at which he
                  had seated himself, and taking up tie demijohn again. The cork was removed, and
                  his nose applied to the mouth of the huge bottle.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it's wine; but I'll vow it's not much to brag of." And the cork was once
                  more replaced.</p>
               <p>Just then came a knock at the door. Mrs. Jones opened it, and the store-keeper's
                  lad appeared.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Smith says, please let me have the jug of antimonial wine he left here."</p>
               <p>"Antimonial wine!" exclaimed Mr. Jones, his chin falling, and a paleness instantly
                  overspread his face.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said the lad.</p>
               <p>"Antimonial wine!" fell again, but huskily, from the quivering lips of Mr. Jones.
                  "Send for the doctor, Kitty, quick! Oh! How sick I feel! Send for the doctor, or
                  I'll be a dead man in half an hour!"</p>
               <p>"Antimonial wine! Dreadful!" exclaimed Mrs. Jones, now as pale and frightened as
                  her husband. "Do you feel sick?"</p>
               <p>"O! yes. As sick as death!" And the appearance of Mr. Jones by no means belied his
                  words. "Send for the doctor instantly, or it may be too late."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones ran first in one direction and then in another, and finally, after
                  telling the boy to run for the doctor, called Jane, her single domestic, and
                  started her on the same errand.</p>
               <p>Off sprung Jane at a speed outstripping that of John Gilpin. Fortunately, the
                  doctor was in his office, and he came with all the rapidity a proper regard to the
                  dignity of his profession would permit, armed with a stomach pump and a dozen
                  antidotes. On arriving at the house of Mr. Jones he found the sufferer lying upon
                  a bed, ghastly pale, and retching terribly.</p>
               <p>"O! doctor! I'm afraid it's all over with me!" gasped the patient.</p>
               <p>"How did it happen? what have you taken?" inquired the doctor, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"I took, by mistake, nearly a pint of antimonial wine."</p>
               <p>"Then it must be removed instantly," said the doctor; and down the sick man's
                  throat went one end of a long, flexible, India rubber tube, and pump! pump! pump!
                  went the doctor's hand at the other end. The result was very palpable. About a
                  pint of reddish fluid, strongly smelling of wine, came up, after which the
                  instrument was withdrawn.</p>
               <p>"There," said the doctor, "I guess that will do. Now let me give you an antidote."
                  And a nauseous dose of something or other was mixed up and poured down, to take
                  the place of what had just been removed.</p>
               <p>"Do you feel any better now?" inquired the doctor, as he sat holding the pulse of
                  the sick man, and scanning, with a professional eye, his pale face, that was
                  covered with a clammy perspiration.</p>
               <p>"A little," was the faint reply. "Do you think all danger is past?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think so. The antidote I have given you will neutralize the effect of the
                  drug, as far as it has passed into the system."</p>
               <p>"I feel as weak as a rag," said the patient. "I am sure I could not bear my own
                  weight. What a powerful effect it had!"</p>
               <p>"Don't think of it," returned the doctor. "Compose yourself. There is now no
                  danger to be apprehended whatever."</p>
               <p>The wild flight of Jane through the street, and the hurried movements of the
                  doctor, did not fail to attract attention. Inquiry followed, and it soon became
                  noised about that Mr. Jones had taken poison.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith was just stepping into his wagon, when a man came up and said to
                  him,</p>
               <p>"Have you heard the news?"</p>
               <p>"What news?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jones has taken poison!"</p>
               <p>"What?"</p>
               <p>"Poison!"</p>
               <p>"Who! Mr. Jones?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. And they say he cannot live."</p>
               <p>"Dreadful! I must see him." And without waiting for further information, Mr. Smith
                  spoke to his horse and rode off at a gallop for the residence of his friend. Mrs.
                  Jones met him at the door, looking very anxious.</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5627-00000075"/>
               <p>"How is he?" inquired Mr. Smith, in a serious voice.</p>
               <p>"A little better, I thank you. The doctor has taken it all out of his stomach.
                  Will you walk up?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith ascended to the chamber where lay Mr. Jones, looking as white as a
                  sheet. The doctor was still by his side.</p>
               <p>"Ah! my friend," said the sick man, in a feeble voice, as Mr. Smith took his hand,
                  "that antimonial wine of yours has nearly been the death of me."</p>
               <p>"What antimonial wine?" inquired Mr. Smith, not understanding his friend.</p>
               <p>"The wine you left here in the gallon demijohn."</p>
               <p>"That wasn't antimonial wine!"</p>
               <p>"It was not?" fell from the lips of both Mr. and Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>"Why, no! It was only wine that I had bought for the purpose of making antimonial
                  wine."</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones rose up in bed.</p>
               <p>"Not antimonial wine?"</p>
               <p>"No!"</p>
               <p>"Why the boy said it was."</p>
               <p>"Then he didn't know any thing about it. It was nothing but some common wine which
                  I had bought."</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones took a long breath. The doctor arose from the bedside, and Mr. Jones
                  exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Well, I never!"</p>
               <p>Then came a grave silence, in which one looked at the other, doubtingly.</p>
               <p>"Good-day;" said the doctor, and went down stairs.</p>
               <p>"So you have been drinking my wine, it seems," laughed Mr. Smith, as soon as the
                  man with the stomach pump had retired.</p>
               <p>"I only took a little toll," said Mr. Jones, back into whose pale face the color
                  was beginning to come, and through whose almost paralyzed nerves was again flowing
                  from the brain a healthy influence. "But don't say any thing about it! Don't for
                  the world!"</p>
               <p>"I won't, on one condition," said Mr. Smith, whose words were scarcely coherent,
                  so strongly was he convulsed with laughter.</p>
               <p>"What is that?"</p>
               <p>"You must become a teetotaller."</p>
               <p>"Can't do that," replied Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>"Give me a day or two to make up my mind."</p>
               <p>"Very well. And now, good bye; the sun is nearly down, and it will be night before
                  I get home."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Smith shook hands with Mr. and Mrs. Jones and hurriedly retired, trying,
                  but in vain, to leave the house in a grave and dignified manner. Long before Mr.
                  Jones had made up his mind to join the teetotallers, the story of his taking toll
                  was all over the town, and for the next two or three months he had his own time of
                  it. After that, it became an old story.</p>

               <head>"THOU ART THE MAN!"</head>
               <p>"HOW can you reconcile it to your conscience to continue in your present business,
                  Mr. Muddler?" asked a venerable clergyman of a tavern-keeper, as the two walked
                  home from the funeral of a young man who had died suddenly.</p>
               <p>"I find no difficulty on that score," replied the tavern-keeper, in a confident
                  tone: "My business is as necessary to the public as that of any other man."</p>
               <p>"That branch of it, which regards the comfort and accommodation of travellers, I
                  will grant to be necessary. But there is another portion of it which, you must
                  pardon me for saying, is not only uncalled for by the real wants of the community,
                  but highly detrimental to health and good morals."</p>
               <p>"And pray, Mr. Mildman, to what portion of my business do you allude?"</p>
               <p>"I allude to that part of it which embraces the sale of intoxicating drinks."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! the very best part of my business. But, certainly, you do not pretend to
                  say that I am to be held accountable for the unavoidable excesses which sometimes
                  grow out of the use of liquors as a beverage?"</p>
               <p>"I certainly must say, that, in my opinions a very large share of the
                  responsibility rests upon your shoulders. You not only make it a business to sell
                  liquors, but you use every device in your power to induce men to come and drink
                  them. You invent new compounds with new and attractive names, in order to induce
                  the indifferent or the lovers of variety, to frequent your bar-room. In this way,
                  you too often draw the weak into an excess of self-indulgence, that ends, alas! in
                  drunkenness and final ruin of body and soul. You are not only responsible for all
                  this, Mr. Muddler, but you bear the weight of a fearful responsibility!"</p>
               <p>"I cannot see the subject in that light, Mr. Mildman," the tavern-keeper said,
                  rather gravely. "Mine is an honest and honourable calling, and it is my duty to my
                  family and to society, to follow it with diligence and a spirit of
                  enterprise."</p>
               <p>"May I ask you a plain question, Mr. Muddler?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, certainly! as many as you please."</p>
               <p>"Can that calling be an honest and honourable one which takes sustenance from the
                  community, and gives back nothing in return?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know that I understand the nature of your question, Mr. Mildman."</p>
               <p>"Consider then society as a man in a larger form, as it really is. In this great
                  body, as in the lesser body of man, there are various functions of use and a
                  reciprocity between the whole. Each function receives a portion of life from the
                  others, and gives back its own proper share for the good of the whole. The hand
                  does not act for itself alone—receiving strength and selfishly appropriating it
                  without returning its quota of good to the general system. And so of the heart,
                  and lungs, and every other organ in the whole body. Reverse the order—and how soon
                  is the entire system diseased! Now, does that member of the great body of the
                  people act honestly and honourably, who regularly receives his portion of good
                  from the general social system, and gives nothing back in return?"</p>
               <p>To this the landlord made no reply, and Mr. Mildman continued—</p>
               <p>"But there is still a stronger view to be taken. Suppose a member of the human
                  body is diseased—a limb, for instance, in a partial state of mortification. Here
                  there is a reception of life from the whole system into that limb, and a constant
                  giving back of disease that gradually pervades the entire body; and, unless that
                  body possesses extraordinary vital energy, in the end destroys it. In like manner,
                  if in the larger body there be one member who takes his share of life from the
                  whole, and gives back nothing but a poisonous principle, whose effect is disease
                  and death, surely he cannot be called a good member—nor honest, nor
                  honourable."</p>
               <p>"And pray, Mr. Mildman," asked the tavern-keeper, with warmth, "where will you
                  find, in society, such an individual as you describe?"</p>
               <p>The minister paused at this question, and looked his<pb n="152-153"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000077"/> companion steadily in the face. Then raising his
                  long, thin finger to give force to his remark, he said with deep emphasis—</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>"Thou art the man!"</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Me, Mr. Mildman! me!" exclaimed the tavern-keeper, in surprise and displeasure.
                  "You surely cannot be in earnest."</p>
               <p>"I utter but a solemn truth, Mr. Muddler: such is your position in society! You
                  receive food, and clothing, and comforts and luxuries of various kinds for
                  yourself and family from the social body, and what do you give back for all these?
                  A poison to steal away the health and happiness of that social body. You are far
                  worse than a perfectly dead member—you exist upon the great body as a moral
                  gangrene. Reflect calmly upon this subject. Go home, and in the silence of your
                  own chamber, enter into unimpassioned and solemn communion with your heart. Be
                  honest with yourself. Exclude the bias of selfish feelings and selfish interests,
                  and honestly define to yourself your true position.'</p>
               <p>"But, Mr. Mildman—"</p>
               <p>The two men had paused nearly in front of Mr. Muddler's splendid establishment,
                  and were standing there when the tavern-keeper commenced a reply to the minister's
                  last remarks. He had uttered but the first word or two, when he was interrupted by
                  a pale, thinly-dressed female, who held a little girl by the hand. She came up
                  before him and looked him steadily in the face for a moment or two.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Muddler, I believe," she said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam, that is my name," was his reply.</p>
               <p>"I have come, Mr. Muddler," the woman then said, with an effort to smile and
                  affect a polite air, "to thank you for a present I received last night."</p>
               <p>"Thank me, madam! There certainly must be some mistake. I never made you a
                  present. Indeed, I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"You said your name was Muddler, I believe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam, as I told you before, that is my name."</p>
               <p>"Then you are the man. You made my little girl, here a present also, and we have
                  both come with our thanks."</p>
               <p>"You deal in riddles, madam, Speak out plainly."</p>
               <p>"As I said before," the woman replied, with bitter irony in her tones, "I have
                  come with my little girl to thank you for the present we received last night;—a
                  present of wretchedness and abuse."</p>
               <p>"I am still as far from understanding you as ever," the tavern-keeper said—I never
                  abused you, madam. I do not even know you."</p>
               <p>"But you know my husband, sir! You have enticed him to your bar, and for his money
                  have given him a poison that has changed him from one of the best and kindest of
                  men, into a demon. To you, then, I owe all the wretchedness I have suffered, and
                  the brutal treatment I shared with my helpless children last night. It is for this
                  that I have come to thank you."</p>
               <p>"Surely, madam, you must be beside yourself. I have nothing to do with your
                  husband."</p>
               <p>"Nothing to do with him!" the woman exclaimed, in an excited tone. "Would to
                  heaven that it were so! Before you opened your accursed gin palace, he was a sober
                  man, and the best and kindest of husbands—but, enticed by you, your advertisement
                  and display of fancy drinks, he was tempted within the charmed circle of your
                  bar-room. From that moment began his downfall; and now he is lost to
                  self-control—lost to feeling—lost to humanity!"</p>
               <p>As the woman said this, she burst into tears, and then turned and walked slowly
                  away.</p>
               <p>"To that painful illustration of the truth of what I have said," the minister
                  remarked, as the two stood once more alone, "I have nothing to add. May the lesson
                  sink deep into your heart. Between you and that woman's husband existed a regular
                  business transaction. Did it result in a mutual benefit? Answer that question to
                  your own conscience."</p>
               <p>How the tavern-keeper answered it, we know not. But if he received no benefit from
                  the double lesson, we trust that others may; and in the hope that the practical
                  truth we have endeavoured briefly to illustrate, will fall somewhere upon good
                  ground, we cast it forth for the benefit of our fellow-men.</p>

               <head>THE TOUCHING REPROOF.</head>
               <p>"HERE, Jane," said a father to his little girl not over eleven years of age, "go
                  over to the shop and buy me a pint of brandy."</p>
               <p>At the same time he handed her a quarter of a dollar. The child took the money and
                  the bottle, and as she did so, looked her father in the face with an earnest, sad
                  expression. But he did not seem to observe it, although he perceived it, and felt
                  it; for he understood its meaning. The little girl lingered, as if reluctant, from
                  some reason, to go on her errand.</p>
               <p>"Did you hear what I said?" the father asked, angrily, and with a frowning brow,
                  as he observed this.</p>
               <p>Jane glided from the room and went over to the shop, hiding, as she passed through
                  the street, the bottle under her apron. There she obtained the liquor, and
                  returned with it in a few minutes. As she reached the bottle to her father, she
                  looked at him again with the same sad, earnest look, which he observed. It annoyed
                  and angered him.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by looking at me in that way? Ha!" he said, in a loud, angry
                  tone.</p>
               <p>Jane shrunk away, and passed into the next room, where her mother lay sick. She
                  had been sick for some time, and as they were poor, and her husband given to
                  drink, she had sorrow and privation added to her bodily sufferings. As her little
                  girl came in, she went up to the side of her bed, and, bending over it, leaned her
                  head upon her hand. She did not make any remark, nor did her mother speak to her,
                  until she observed the tears trickling through her fingers.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, my dear?" she then asked, tenderly.</p>
               <p>The little girl raised her head, endeavouring to dry up her tears as she did
                  so.</p>
               <p>"I feel so bad, mother," she replied.</p>
               <p>"And why do you feel bad, my child?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I always feel so bad when father sends me over to the shop for brandy; and I
                  had to go just now. I wanted to ask him to buy you some nice grapes and oranges
                  with the quarter of a dollar—they would taste so good to you—but he seemed to know
                  what I was going to say, and looked at me so cross that I was afraid to speak. I
                  wish he would not drink any more brandy. It makes him cross; and then how many
                  nice things he might buy for you with the money it takes for liquor."</p>
               <p>The poor mother had no words of comfort to offer her little girl, older in thought
                  than in years; for no comfort did she herself feel in view of the circumstances
                  that troubled her child. She only said—aying her hand upon the child's head—</p>
               <p>"Try and not think about it, my dear; it only troubles you, and your trouble
                  cannot make it any better."</p>
               <p>But Jane could not help thinking about it, try as hard as she would. She went to a
                  Sabbath school, in which a Temperance society had been formed, and every Sabbath
                  she heard the subject of intemperance discussed, and its dreadful consequences
                  detailed. But more than all this, she had the daily experience of a drunkard's
                  child. In this experience, how much of heart-touching misery was involved!—how
                  much of privation—how much of the anguish of a bruised spirit. Who can know the
                  weight that lies, like a heavy burden, upon the heart of a drunkard's child! None
                  but the child—for language is powerless to convey it.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, the father of little Jane went away to his work, and she was
                  left alone with her mother and her younger sister. They were very poor, and could
                  not afford to employ any one to do the house-work, and so, young as she was, while
                  her mother was sick, Jane had everything to do:—the cooking, and cleaning, and
                  even the washing and ironing—a hard task, indeed, for her little hands. But she
                  never murmured—never seemed to think that she was overburdened; How cheerfully
                  would all have been done, if her father's smiles had only fallen like sunshine
                  upon her heart! But that face, into which her eyes looked so often and so
                  anxiously, was<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5627-00000079"/> ever hid in
                  clouds—clouds arising from the consciousness that he was abusing his family while
                  seeking his own base gratification, and from perceiving the evidences of his evil
                  works stamped on all things around him.</p>
               <p>As Jane passed frequently through her mother's room during the morning, pausing
                  almost every time to ask if she wanted anything; she saw, too plainly, that she
                  was not as well as on the day before—that she had a high fever, indicated to her
                  by her hot skin and constant request for cool water.</p>
               <p>"I wish I had an orange," the poor woman said, as Jane came up to her bed-side,
                  for the twentieth time, "it would taste so good to me."</p>
               <p>She had been thinking about an orange all the morning; and notwithstanding her
                  effort to drive the thought from her mind, the form of an orange would ever
                  picture itself before her, and its grateful flavour ever seem about to thrill upon
                  her taste. At last she uttered her wish—not so much with the hope of having it
                  gratified, as from an involuntary impulse to speak out her desire.</p>
               <p>There was not a single cent in the house, for the father rarely trusted his wife
                  with money—he could not confide in her judicious expenditure of it!</p>
               <p>"Let me go and buy you an orange, mother," Jane said; "they have oranges at the
                  shop."</p>
               <p>"I have no change, my dear; and if I had, I should not think it right to spend
                  four or five cents for an orange, when we have so little. Get me a cool drink of
                  water; that will do now."</p>
               <p>Jane brought the poor sufferer a glass of cool water, and she drank it off
                  eagerly. Then she lay back upon her pillow with a sigh, and her little girl went
                  out to attend to the household duties that devolved upon her. But all the while
                  Jane thought of the orange, and of how she should get it for her mother.</p>
               <p>When her father came home to dinner, he looked crosser than he did in the morning.
                  He sat down to the table and eat his dinner in moody silence, and then arose to
                  depart, without so much as asking after his sick wife, or going into her chamber.
                  As he moved towards the door, his hat already on his head, Jane went up to him,
                  and looking timidly in his face, said, with a hesitating voice—</p>
               <p>"Mother wants an orange so bad. Won't you give me some money to buy her one?"</p>
               <p>"No, I will not! Your mother had better be thinking about something else than
                  wasting money for oranges!" was the angry reply, as the father passed out, and
                  shut the door hard after him.</p>
               <p>Jane stood for a moment, frightened at the angry vehemence of her father, and then
                  burst into tears. She said nothing to her mother of what had passed, but after the
                  agitation of her mind had somewhat subsided, began to cast about in her thoughts
                  for some plan by which she might obtain an orange. At last it occurred to her,
                  that at the shop where she got liquor for her father, they bought rags and old
                  iron.</p>
               <p>"How much do you give a pound for rags?" she asked, in a minute or two after the
                  idea had occurred to her, standing at the counter of the shop.</p>
               <p>"Three cents a pound," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"How much for old iron?"</p>
               <p>"A cent a pound."</p>
               <p>"What's the price of them oranges?"</p>
               <p>"Four cents apiece."</p>
               <p>With this information, Jane hurried back. After she had cleared away the
                  dinner-table, she went down into the cellar and looked up all the old bits of iron
                  that she could find. Then she searched the yard, and found some eight or ten rusty
                  nails, an old bolt, and a broken hinge. These she laid away in a little nook in
                  the cellar. Afterwards she gathered together all the old rags that she could find
                  about the house, and in the cellar, and laid them with her old iron. But she saw
                  plainly enough that her iron would not weigh over two pounds, nor her rags over a
                  quarter of a pound. If time would have permitted, she would have gone into the
                  street to look for old iron, but this she could not do; and disappointed at not
                  being able to get the orange for her mother, she went about her work during the
                  afternoon with sad and desponding thoughts and feelings.</p>
               <p>It was summer time, and her father came home from his work before it was dark.</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5627-00000080"/>
               <p>"Go and get me a pint of brandy," he said to Jane, in a tone that sounded harsh
                  and angry to the child, handing her at the same time a quarter of a dollar. Since
                  the day before he had taken a pint of brandy, and none but the best would suit
                  him.</p>
               <p>She took the money and the bottle, and went over to the shop. Wistfully she looked
                  at the tempting oranges in the window, as she gave the money for the liquor,—and
                  thought how glad her poor mother would be to have one.</p>
               <p>As she was hurrying back, she saw a thick rusty iron ring lying in the street: she
                  picked it up, and kept on her way. It felt heavy, and her heart bounded with the
                  thought that now she could buy the orange for her mother. The piece of old iron
                  was dropped in the yard, as she passed through. After her father had taken a dram,
                  he sat down to his supper. While he was eating it, Jane went into the cellar and
                  brought out into the yard her little treasure of scrap iron. As she passed
                  backwards and forwards before the door facing which her father sat, he observed
                  her, and felt a sudden curiosity to know what she was doing. He went softly to the
                  window, and as he did so, he saw her gathering the iron, which she had placed in a
                  little pile, into her apron. Then she rose up quickly, and passed out of the
                  yard-gate into the street.</p>
               <p>The father went back to his supper, but his appetite was gone. There was that in
                  the act of his child, simple as it was, that moved his feelings, in spite of
                  himself. All at once he thought of the orange she had asked for her mother; and he
                  felt a conviction that it was to buy an orange that Jane was now going to sell the
                  iron she had evidently been collecting since dinner-time.</p>
               <p>"How selfish and wicked I am!" he said to himself, almost involuntarily.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Jane returned, and with her hand under her apron, passed through
                  the room where he sat into her mother's chamber. An impulse, almost irresistible,
                  caused him to follow her in a few moments after.</p>
               <p>"It is so grateful!" he heard his wife say, as he opened the door.</p>
               <p>On entering her chamber, he found her sitting up in bed eating the orange, while
                  little Jane stood by her looking into her face with an air of subdued, yet
                  heartfelt gratification fication. All this he saw at a glance, yet did not seem to
                  see, for he pretended to be searching for something, which, apparently obtained,
                  he left the room and the house, with feelings of acute pain and
                  self-upbraidings.</p>
               <p>"Come, let us go and see these cold-water men," said a companion, whom he met a
                  few steps from his own door. "They are carrying all the world before them."</p>
               <p>"Very well, come along."</p>
               <p>And the two men bent their steps towards Temperance Hall.</p>
               <p>When little Jane's father turned from the door of that place, his name was signed
                  to the pledge, and his heart fixed to abide by it. On his way home, he saw some
                  grapes in a window,—he bought some of them, and a couple of oranges and lemons.
                  When he came home, he—went into his wife's chamber, and opening the paper that
                  contained the first fruits of his sincere repentance, laid them before her, and
                  said, with tenderness, while the moisture dimmed his eyes—</p>
               <p>"I thought these would taste good to you, Mary, and so I bought them."</p>
               <p>"O, William!" and the poor wife started, and looked up into her husband's face
                  with an expression of surprise and trembling hope.</p>
               <p>"Mary,"—and he took her hand, tenderly—"I have signed the pledge to-night, and I
                  will keep it, by the help of Heaven!"</p>
               <p>The sick wife raised herself up quickly, and bent over towards her husband,
                  eagerly extending her hands. Then, as he drew his arm around her, she let her head
                  fall upon his bosom, with an emotion of delight, such as had not moved over the
                  surface of her stricken heart for years.</p>
               <p>The pledge taken was the total-abstinence pledge, and it has never been violated
                  by him, and what is better, we are confident never will. How much of human hope
                  and happiness is involved in that simple pledge!</p>

               <head>THE TEMPERANCE SONG.</head>
               <p>"DEAR father," said Mary Edwards, "don't go out this evening!" and the young girl,
                  who had scarcely numbered fourteen years, laid her hand upon the arm of her
                  parent.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Edwards shook her off impatiently, muttering, as he did so,</p>
               <p>"Can't I go where I please?"</p>
               <p>"O! yes, father!" urged Mary, drawing up to him again, notwithstanding her
                  repulse. "But there is going to be a storm, and I wouldn't go out."</p>
               <p>"Storm! Nonsense! That's only your pretence. But I'll be home soon—long before the
                  rain, if it comes at all."</p>
               <p>And, saying this, Mr. Edwards turned from his daughter and left the house. As soon
                  as she was alone, Mary sat down and commenced weeping. There had been sad changes
                  since she was ten years old. In that time, her father had fallen into habits of
                  intemperance, and not only wasted his substance, but abused his family; and,
                  sadder still, her mother had died broken-hearted, leaving her alone in the world
                  with a drunken father.</p>
               <p>The young girl's trials, under these painful circumstances, were great. Night
                  after night her father would come home intoxicated, and it was so rare a thing for
                  her to get a kind word from him, that a tone of affection from his lips would move
                  her instantly to tears. Daily the work of declension went on. Drunkenness led to
                  idleness, and gradually Mr. Edwards and his child sunk lower and lower in the
                  scale of comfort. The pleasant home where they had lived for years was. given up,
                  and in small, poorly furnished rooms, in a narrow street, they hid themselves from
                  observation. After this change, Mr. Edwards moved along his downward way, more
                  rapidly; earning less and drinking more.</p>
               <p>Mary grew old fast. Under severe trials and afflictions, her mind rapidly matured;
                  and her affection for her father, grew stronger and stronger, as she realized more
                  and more fully the dreadful nature and ultimate tendency of the infatuation by
                  which he was led.</p>
               <p>At last, in the anguish of her concern, she ventured upon remonstrance. This
                  brought only angry repulse, adding bitterness to her cup of sorrow. The appearance
                  of a storm, on the evening to which we have alluded, gave Mary an excuse for
                  urging her father not to go out. How her remonstrance was received has been seen.
                  While the poor girl sat weeping, the distant rolling of thunder indicated the
                  approach of the storm to which she had referred. But she cared little for it now.
                  Her father had gone out. She had spoken of it only with the hope that he might
                  have been induced to remain with her. Now that he was away, the agitation within
                  was too great to leave any concern for the turbulent elements without.</p>
               <p>On leaving his home, Mr. Edwards, who had not taken any liquor for three or four
                  hours, and whose appetite was sharp for the accustomed stimulus, walked quickly in
                  the direction of a drinking-house where he usually spent his evenings. On
                  entering, he found that there was a little commotion in the bar-room. A certain
                  individual, not over friendly to landlords, had intruded himself; and, his
                  character being known, the inmates were disposed to have a little sport with
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Come now, old fellow!" said one, just as Edwards came in,—"mount this table and
                  make us a first rate temperance speech."</p>
               <p>"Do; and I'll treat you to the stiffest glass of whisky toddy the landlord can
                  mix," added another. "Or perhaps you'd like a mint julep or gin cocktail better?
                  Any thing you please. Make the speech and call for the liquor. I'll stand the
                  treat."</p>
               <p>"What d'ye say, landlord? Shall he make the speech?" said another, who was eager
                  for sport.</p>
               <p>"Please yourselves," replied the landlord, "and you'll please me."</p>
               <p>"Very well. Now for the speech, old fellow! Here! mount this table." And two or
                  three of the most forward took hold of his arms.</p>
               <p>"I'm not just in the humor for making a speech," said the temperance man, "but, if
                  it will please you as well, I'll sing you a song."</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5627-00000082"/>
               <p>"Give us a song then. Any thing to accommodate. But come, let's liquor first."</p>
               <p>"No!" said the other firmly, "I must sing the song first, if I sing it at
                  all."</p>
               <p>"Don't you think your pipes will be clearer for a little drink of some kind or
                  other."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps they would," was replied. "So, provided you have no objection, I'll take
                  a glass of cold water—if such a thing is known in this place."</p>
               <p>The glass of water was presented, and then the man, who was somewhat advanced in
                  years, prepared to give the promised song. All stood listening attentively,
                  Edwards among the rest. The voice of the old man was low and tremulous, yet every
                  word was uttered distinctly, and with a pathos which showed that the meaning was
                  felt. The following well-known temperance song was the one that he sung; and while
                  his voice filled the bar-room every other sound was hushed. <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The silence that pervaded the room when the old man's voice died, or might rather
                  be said, sobbed away, was as the silence of death. His own heart was touched, for
                  he wiped his eyes, from which tears had started. Pausing scarcely a moment, he
                  moved slowly from the room, and left his audience to their own reflections. There
                  was not one of them who was not more or less affected; but the deepest impression
                  had been made on the heart of Edwards. The song seemed as if it had been made for
                  him. The second verse, particularly, went thrilling to the very centre of his
                  feelings. <q>
                     <l>"Sadly my wife bowed her beautiful head!"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>How suddenly arose before him the sorrow-stricken form of the wife of his youth at
                  these words! and when the old man's voice faltered on the line— <q>
                     <l>"Poor, broken-hearted! 'twas well that she died!"</l>
                  </q> the anguish of his spirit was so great, that he only kept himself from
                  sobbing aloud by a strong effort at self-control. Ere the spell was broken, or a
                  word uttered by any one, he arose and left the house.</p>
               <p>For many minutes after her father's departure, Mary sat weeping bitterly. She felt
                  hopeless and deserted. Tenderly did she love her parent; but this love was only a
                  source of the keenest anguish, for she saw him swiftly passing along the road to
                  destruction without the power to save him.</p>
               <p>Grief wastes itself by its own violence. So it was in this instance. The tears of
                  Mary were at length dried; her sobs were hushed, and she was about rising from her
                  chair, when a blinding flash of lightning glared into the room, followed instantly
                  by a deafening jar of thunder.</p>
               <p>"Oh, if father were home!" she murmured, clasping her hands together.</p>
               <p>Even while she stood in this attitude, the door opened quietly, and Mr. Edwards
                  entered.</p>
               <p>"I thought you would be afraid, Mary; and so I came home," said he in a kind
                  voice.</p>
               <p>Mary looked at him with surprise. This was soon changed to joy as she perceived
                  that he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>"Oh, father!" she sobbed, unable to control her feelings,<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000083"/> and leaning her face against his breast as she
                  spoke—"if you would never go away!"</p>
               <p>Tenderly the father drew his arm around his weeping child, and kissed her pure
                  forehead.</p>
               <p>"Mary," said he, as calmly as he could speak, "for your mother's sake—" but he
                  could not finish the sentence. His voice quivered, and became inarticulate.</p>
               <p>Solemnly, in the silence of his own heart, did the father, as he stood thus with
                  his child in his arms, repeat the vows he had already taken. And he kept his
                  vows.</p>
               <p>Wonderful is the power of music! It is the heart's own language, and speaks to it
                  in a voice of irresistible persuasion. It is a good gift from heaven, and should
                  ever be used in a good cause.</p>

               <head>THE DISTILLER'S DREAM.</head>
               <p>FROM the time Mr. Andrew Grim opened a low grogshop near the Washington Market,
                  until, as a wealthy distiller, he counted himself worth a hundred thousand
                  dollars, every thing had gone on smoothly; and now he might be seen among the
                  money-lords of the day, as self-complacent as any. He had stock, houses, and
                  lands: and, in his mind, these made up life's greatest good. And had he not
                  obtained them in honest trade? Were they not the reward of persevering industry?
                  Mr. Grim felt proud of the fact, that he was the architect of his own fortunes.
                  "How many had started in life side by side with him; and yet scarcely one in ten
                  of them had risen above the common level."</p>
               <p>Thoughts like these often occupied the mind of Mr. Grim. Such were his thoughts as
                  he sat in his luxurious parlor, one bleak December evening, surrounded by every
                  external comfort his heart could desire, when a child not over seven or eight
                  years of age was brought into the room by a servant, who said, as he entered—</p>
               <p>"Here's a little girl that says she wants to see you."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grim, turned, and looked for a moment or two at the visiter. She was the child
                  of poor parents; that was evident from her coarse and meager garments.</p>
               <p>"Do you wish to see me?" he inquired, in a voice that was meant to be
                  repulsive.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," timidly answered the child.</p>
               <p>"Well, what do you want?"</p>
               <p>"My mother wants you."</p>
               <p>"Your mother! Who's your mother?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Dyer."</p>
               <p>The manner of Mr. Grim changed instantly; and he said—</p>
               <p>"Indeed! What does your mother want?"</p>
               <p>"Father is sick; and mother says he will die."</p>
               <p>"What ails your father?"</p>
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5627-00000084"/>
               <p>"I don't know. But he's been sick ever since yesterday; and he screams out so, and
                  frightens us all."</p>
               <p>"Where does your mother live?"</p>
               <p>The child gave the street and number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grim walked about the room uneasily for some time.</p>
               <p>"Didn't your mother say what she wanted with me?" he asked again, pausing before
                  the little girl, whose eyes had been following all his movements.</p>
               <p>"No, sir. But she cried when she told me to go for you."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grim moved about the room again for some time. Then stopping suddenly, he
                  said—</p>
               <p>"Go home and tell your mother I'll be there in a little while."</p>
               <p>The child retired from the room, and Mr. Grim resumed his perambulations, his eyes
                  upon the floor, and a shadow resting on his countenance. After the lapse of nearly
                  half an hour he went into the hall, and drawing on a warm overcoat, started forth
                  in obedience to what was evidently an unwelcome summons—for he muttered to himself
                  as he descended to the pavement—</p>
               <p>"I wish people would take care of what they get, and learn to depend on
                  themselves."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grim took an omnibus and rode as far as Canal street. Down Canal street he
                  walked to West Broadway, and along West Broadway for a couple of blocks, when he
                  stopped before an old brick house that looked as if it had seen service for at
                  least a hundred years, and examined the number.</p>
               <p>"This is the place, I suppose," said he, fretfully. And he stepped back and looked
                  up at the house. Then he approached the door, and searched for a bell or knocker;
                  but of neither of these appendages could the dwelling boast. First, he rapped with
                  his knuckles, then with his cane. But no one responded to the summons. He looked
                  up and saw lights in the window. So he knocked again, and louder. After waiting
                  several minutes, and not being admitted, Mr. Grim tried the door and found it
                  unfastened; but the passage into which he stepped was dark as midnight. After
                  knocking on the floor loudly with his cane, a door opened above, a gleam of light
                  fell on an old stairway, and a rough voice called out,</p>
               <p>"Who's there?"</p>
               <p>"Does Mr. Dyer live here?"</p>
               <p>"Be sure he does!" was roughly answered.</p>
               <p>"Will you be kind enough to show me his room?"</p>
               <p>"You'll find it in the third story back," said the voice, impatiently. The door
                  was shut again, and all was dark as before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grim stood irresolute for a few moments, and then commenced groping his way up
                  stairs, slowly and cautiously. Just as he gained the landing on the second flight,
                  a stifled scream was heard in one of the rooms on the third floor, followed by a
                  sudden movement, as if two persons were struggling in a murderous conflict. He
                  stopped and listened, while a chill went over him. A long shuddering groan
                  followed, and then all was still again. Mr. Grim was about retreating, when a door
                  opened, and the child who had called for him came out with a candle in her hand.
                  The light fell upon his form and the child saw him.</p>
               <p>"Oh! mother! mother!" she cried, "Mr. Grim is here!"'</p>
               <p>Instantly the form of a woman was seen in the door. Her look was wild and
                  distressed, and her hair, which had become loosened from the comb, lay in heavy
                  masses upon her shoulders.</p>
               <p>"For heaven's sake, Mary! what is the matter?" exclaimed Mr. Grim, as he
                  approached the woman.</p>
               <p>"The matter!" She looked sternly at the visiter. "Come and see!" And she pointed
                  into the room.</p>
               <p>A cry of unutterable distress broke upon the air, and the woman sprang back
                  quickly into the room. Mr. Grim hurried after her. By the feeble light of a single
                  poor candle, he saw a half-clothed man crouching fearfully in a corner of the
                  room, with his hands raised in the attitude of defence.</p>
               <p>"Keep off! Keep off, I say!" he cried, despairingly. "Oh! oh! oh! It's on me,
                  Mary! Mary! Oh! Lord, help me! help me!"</p>
               <p>And as these broken sentences fell from his lips, he shrunk closer and closer into
                  the corner, and then fell forward, writhing upon the floor. By this time, his wife
                  was bending down over him, and with her assuring voice she soon succeeded in
                  quieting him.</p>
               <p>"They've all gone now, Henry," said she, in a tone<pb n="168-169"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000085"/> of cheerful confidence, assumed at what an effort!
                  "I've driven them away. Come! lie down upon the bed."</p>
               <p>"They're under the bed," replied the sufferer, glancing fearfully around. "Yes,
                  yes! There! I see that blackest devil with the snake in his hand. He's grinning at
                  me from behind the bed post. Now he's going to throw his horrible snake at me!
                  There! oh-oh-oh-oh!"</p>
               <p>The fearful, despairing scream that issued from the poor creature's lips, as he
                  clung to his wife, curdled the very blood in the veins of Mr. Grim, who now
                  comprehended the meaning of the scene. Dyer and his wife were friends of other
                  days. With the latter he had grown up from childhood, and there were many reasons
                  why he felt an interest in her. Her husband had learned drinking and idleness in
                  his bar-room, many years before; and more than once during the time of his
                  declension, had she called upon Mr. Grim, and earnestly besought him to do
                  something to save the one she loved best on earth from impending ruin. But, he had
                  entered the downward way, and it seemed that nothing could stop his rapid
                  progress. Now he met him, after the lapse of ten years, and found him mad with the
                  drunkard's madness.</p>
               <p>The scene was too painful for Mr. Grim. He could not bear it. So, hurriedly
                  drawing his purse from his pocket, he threw it upon the floor, and turning from
                  the room made his way out of the house, trembling in every nerve. When he arrived
                  at home, the perspiration stood cold and clammy on every part of his body. His
                  mind was greatly excited. Most vividly did he picture, in imagination, the
                  horrible fiend, striking the poor drunken wretch with his serpent spear, or
                  blasting him with his terrific countenance. For an hour he walked the floor of his
                  chamber, and then, exhausted in body and mind, threw himself on a bed, and tried
                  to find oblivion in sleep. But, though he wooed the gentle goddess, she came not
                  with her soothing poppies. Too vivid was the impression of what he had seen, and
                  too painful were the accompanying reflections, to admit of sweet repose. At last,
                  however, exhaustion came, and he fell into that half sleeping and waking state—in
                  which the imagination remains active, so painful to endure. In this state, one
                  picture presented by imagination was most vivid of all; it was the picture of poor
                  Dyer, shrinking from the fiend with the serpent, which latter was now as plainly
                  visible to him as it had been to the unhappy drunkard. Presently the fiend began
                  to turn his eyes upon him with a malignant expression; then it glanced from him to
                  the drunkard, and pointing at the latter, said Grim heard the voice
                  distinctly—</p>
               <p>"<emph>It is your work!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The distiller closed his eyes to hide from view the grinning phantom. But it did
                  not shut out the vision. The fiend was before him still; and now it swung around
                  its head a horrid serpent with distended jaws, and seemed about to dash it upon
                  him. He cowered and groaned in fear. As he still gazed upon the dreadful form, it
                  slowly changed into a female of stern yet beautiful aspect. In one hand she held a
                  naked sword, and in the other a balance. Her knew her, and trembled still more
                  intensely.</p>
               <p>"I am JUSTICE," said the figure. "You have been weighed in the balance and found
                  wanting. The world is sustained by mutual benefits. No man can live wholly for
                  himself. Each must serve the others. What one man produces another enjoys. You
                  have enjoyed, in abundance, the good things produced by others; but what has been
                  your return? Let me show you the work of your hands. Look!"</p>
               <p>Suddenly there was a murmur of voices; the sound came nearer and nearer, and a
                  crowd of men and women came eagerly toward the prostrate distiller—all eyes upon
                  him, and all countenances expressive of anger, rebuke, or despair. One poor mother
                  held towards him her ragged, starving child, and cried—</p>
               <p>"Your cursed trade has murdered his father. Give him back to us!"</p>
               <p>Another marred and degraded wretch called, with clenched hand—</p>
               <p>"Where is my money, my good name, my all?" You have robbed me of every thing!"</p>
               <p>By his side was a poor drunkard, supporting the pale form of his sick wife, while
                  their starving children stood weeping before them—</p>
               <p>"Look at us?" said he. "It is <emph>your</emph> handy-work!"</p>
               <p>And there were dozens of others in the squalid crowd<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000086"/> who called to him with bitter execrations, or
                  pointed to their ruined homes and cried—</p>
               <p>"It is your work! Your work! Rum—rum has cursed us!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, this is your work," said Justice, sternly. "For the good things of life you
                  received on all hands from your fellow-men, you gave them back a stream of fire to
                  consume them. Wealth is the representative of use to society. It comes, or should
                  come, as a reward for serving the common good. So earned, it is a blessing; and he
                  who thus gains it has a right to its possession. But, in your eager pursuit of
                  gain you have cursed every man who brought you a blessing; and now your ill-gotten
                  wealth must be given up. See!"</p>
               <p>And, as she spoke, she pointed to an immense bag of gold.</p>
               <p>"It is all there!" continued Justice. "Your houses and lands, your stocks and your
                  merchandise, have been converted into gold; and I now distribute it once more
                  among the people, to be gathered by those more worthy to possess it than
                  thou!"</p>
               <p>Then a troop of fiends came rushing down through the air, and, seizing the bag,
                  were bearing it off in triumph, when the agonized sleeper sprang towards his gold,
                  and in the effort threw off the terrible nightmare that was almost crushing out
                  his life.</p>
               <p>There was no sleep for him during the hours that intervened until the daylight
                  broke. The images he had seen, and the words he had heard, were before him all the
                  time, crushing his heart like the pressure of heavy footsteps. As soon as the day
                  had dawned he started forth and sought the dwelling he had so hastily left on the
                  night before. All was silent as he ascended the stairway. The door of the room
                  where he had been stood partly open. He listened a moment—all was silent. He moved
                  the door, but nothing stirred within. Then he entered. His purse lay upon the
                  floor where he had thrown it; that was the first object which met his sight. The
                  next was the ghastly face of death! The wretched drunkard had passed to his
                  account; and his body lay upon the bed. Close beside was the form of her who had
                  been to Mr. Grim, in early years, as a tender sister. She was in a profound sleep;
                  and on the floor lay the child, also wrapped in deep forgetfulness of the misery
                  with which she was surrounded.—</p>
               <p>"And this is the work I have been doing!" sighed the distiller; whose mind could
                  not lose the vivid impression made by his dream.</p>
               <p>A little while he contemplated the scene around him, and then taking up his purse
                  he silently withdrew. But ere returning home he made known to a benevolent person
                  the fact of the unhappy death which had occurred, and, placing money in his hand,
                  asked him to do all that humanity required, and to do it at his expense.</p>
               <p>Few men went about their daily business with a heavier heart than Mr. Andrew Grim.
                  He felt that he was the possessor of ill-gotten gain; and felt, besides, a sense
                  of insecurity.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Wealth is the representative of use to society. It comes, or should
                  come, as a reward for serving the common good," he repeated to himself, in the
                  words he had heard in his dream. "And how have I served the common good? What good
                  have I performed that corresponds to the blessings I have received and enjoy? Ah,
                  me! I wish it were otherwise."</p>
               <p>With such thoughts, how could the man be happy! When night came round again he
                  feared to trust himself in the arms of sleep; and when exhausted nature yielded,
                  painful dreams haunted him until morning. Weeks elapsed before the vivid
                  impression he had received wore off, and before he enjoyed any thing like a quiet
                  slumber. But, though he had a better sleep, his waking thoughts ceased to be
                  peaceful and self-satisfying. A year went by, and then, fretted beyond endurance
                  at his position of manufacturer of death and destruction, both natural and
                  spiritual, for his fellow men, he broke up his distillery, and invested his money
                  in a business that could be followed with benefit to all.</p>

                  <p>"HOW beautiful!" ejaculated Mary Graham, as she fixed her eyes intently on the
                     western sky, rich with the many-coloured clouds of a brilliant sunset in
                     June.</p>
                  <p>"Beautiful indeed!" responded her sister Anna.</p>
                  <p>"I could gaze on it for ever!" Ellen, a younger and more enthusiastic sister
                     remarked, with fervent admiration. "Look, Ma! was ever anything more gorgeous
                     than that pure white cloud, fringed with brilliant gold, and relieved by the
                     translucent and sparkling sky beyond?"</p>
                  <p>"It is indeed very beautiful, Ellen," Mrs. Graham replied. But there was an
                     abstraction in her manner, that indicated, too plainly, that something weighed
                     upon her mind.</p>
                  <p>"You don't seem to enjoy a rich sunset as much as you used to do, Ma," Anna
                     said, for she felt the tone and manner in which her mother had expressed her
                     admiration of the scene.</p>
                  <p>"You only think so, perhaps," Mrs. Graham rejoined, endeavouring to arouse
                     herself, and to feel interested in the brilliant exhibition of nature to which
                     her daughter had alluded. "The scene is, indeed, very beautiful, Anna, and
                     reminds me strongly of some of Wordsworth's exquisite descriptions, so full of
                     power to awaken the heart's deepest and purest emotions. You all remember this: <q>

                  <p>"How calm and elevating to the heart, like the hour he describes," Ellen said,
                     in a musing tone, as she sat with her eyes fixed intently on the slow-fading
                     glories of the many-coloured clouds.</p>
                  <p>The influence of the tranquil hour gradually subdued them into silence; and as
                     the twilight began to fall, each sat in the enjoyment of a pure and refined
                     pleasure, consequent upon a true appreciation of the beautiful in nature,
                     combined with highly cultivated tastes, and innocent and elevated thoughts.</p>
                  <p>"There comes Pa, I believe," Anna remarked, breaking the silence, as the hall
                     door opened and then closed with a heavy jar; and the well-known sound of her
                     father's footsteps was heard along the passage and on the stairs.</p>
                  <p>None of her children observed the hushed intensity with which Mrs. Graham
                     listened, as their father ascended to the chamber. But they noticed that she
                     became silent and more thoughtful than at first. In about ten minutes she arose
                     and left the room.</p>
                  <p>"Something seems to trouble Ma, of late," Ellen observed, as soon as their
                     mother had retired.</p>
                  <p>"So I have thought. She is certainly, to all appearance, less cheerful, "Mary
                     replied.</p>
                  <p>"What can be the cause of it?"</p>
                  <p>"I hardly think there can be any very serious cause. We are none of us always
                     in the same state of mind."</p>
                  <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5627-00000088"/>
                  <p>"But I have noticed a change, in Ma, for some months past—and particularly in
                     the last few weeks," Anna said. "She is not happy."</p>
                  <p>"I remember, now, that I overheard her, about six weeks ago, talking to Alfred
                     about something—the company he kept, I believe—and that he seemed angry, and
                     spoke to her, I thought, unkindly. Since that time she has not seemed so
                     cheerful;" Ellen said.</p>
                  <p>"That may be the cause; but still I hardly think that it is," Anna replied.
                     "Alfred's principal associates are William Gray and Charles Williams; and they
                     belong to our first families. Pa, you know, is very intimate with both Mr. Gray
                     and Mr. Williams."</p>
                  <p>"It was to William Gray and Charles Williams, I believe, however, that Ma
                     particularly objected."</p>
                  <p>"Upon what ground?"</p>
                  <p>"Upon the ground of their habits, I think, she said."</p>
                  <p>"Their habits? What of their habits, I wonder?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not know, I am sure. I only remember having heard Ma object to them on
                     that account."</p>
                  <p>"That is strange!" was the remark of Anna. "I am sure that I have never seen
                     anything out of the way, in either of them; and, as to William Gray, I have
                     always esteemed him very highly."</p>
                  <p>"So have I," Mary said. "Both of them are intelligent, agreeable young men; and
                     such, as it seems to me, are in every way fitted to be companions for our
                     brother."</p>
                  <p>But Mrs. Graham had seen more of the world than her daughters, and knew how to
                     judge from appearances far better than they. Some recent circumstances,
                     likewise, had quickened her perceptions of danger, and made them doubly acute.
                     In the two young men alluded to, now about the ages of eighteen and twenty, she
                     had been pained to observe strong indications of a growing want of strict moral
                     restraints, combined with a tendency towards dissipation; and, what was still
                     more painful, an exhibition of like perversions in her only son, now on the
                     verge of manhood,—that deeply responsible and dangerous period, when parental
                     authority and control subside in a degree, and the individual, inexperienced
                     yet self-confident, assumes the task of guiding himself.</p>
                  <p>When Mrs. Graham left the room, she proceeded slowly up to the chamber into
                     which her husband had gone, where all had been silent since his entrance. She
                     found him lying upon the bed, and already in a sound sleep. The moment she bent
                     over him, she perceived the truth to be that which her trembling and sinking
                     heart so much dreaded. He was intoxicated!</p>
                  <p>Shrinking away from the bed-side, she retired to a far corner of the room,
                     where she seated herself by a table, and burying her face in her arms, gave way
                     to the most gloomy, heart-aching thoughts and feelings. Tears brought her no
                     relief from these; for something of hopelessness in her sorrow, gave no room
                     for the blessing of tears.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Graham was a merchant of high standing in Philadelphia, where, for many
                     years, he had been engaged extensively in the East India trade. Six beautiful
                     ships floated for years upon the ocean, returning at regular intervals,
                     freighted with the rich produce of the East, and filling his coffers, until
                     they overflowed, with accumulating wealth. But it was not wealth alone that
                     gave to Mr. Graham the elevated social position that he held. His strong
                     intelligence, and the high moral tone of his character, gave him an influence
                     and an estimation far above what he derived from his great riches. In the
                     education of his children, four in number, he had been governed by a wise
                     regard to the effect which that education would have upon them as members of
                     society. He early instilled into their minds a desire to be useful to others,
                     and taught them the difference between an estimation of individuals, founded
                     upon their wealth and position in society, and an estimation derived from
                     intrinsic excellence of character. The consequence of, all this was, to make
                     him beloved by his family—purely and tenderly beloved, because there was added
                     to the natural affection for one in his position, the power of a deep respect
                     for his character and principles.</p>
                  <p>At the time of his introduction to the reader, Mr. Graham was forty-five years
                     old. Alfred, his oldest child, was twenty-one; Mary, nineteen; Ellen, eighteen;
                     and Anna just entering her sixteenth year. Up to this time, or nearly to this
                     time, a happier family circled no hearth in the city. But now an evil wing was
                     hovering over<pb n="176 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5627-00000089"/> them, the
                     shadow from which had already been perceived by the mother's heart, as it fell
                     coldly and darkly upon it, causing it to shrink and tremble with gloomy
                     apprehensions. From early manhood up, it had been the custom of Mr. Graham to
                     use wines and brandies as liberally as he desired, without, the most remote
                     suspicion once crossing his mind that any danger to him could attend the
                     indulgence. But to the eye of his wife, whose suspicions had of late been
                     aroused, and her perceptions rendered, in consequence, doubly acute, it had
                     become apparent that the habit was gaining a fatal predominance over him. She
                     noted, with painful emotions, that as each evening returned, there were to her
                     eye too evident indications that he had been indulging so freely in the use of
                     liquors, as to have his mind greatly obscured. His disposition, too, was
                     changing; and he was becoming less cheerful in his family, and less interested
                     in the pleasures and pursuits of his children. Alfred, whom he had, up to this
                     time, regarded with an earnest and careful solicitude, was now almost entirely
                     left to his own guidance, at an age, too, when he needed more than ever the
                     direction of his father's matured experience.</p>
                  <p>All these exhibitions of a change so unlooked for, and so terrible for a wife
                     and mother to contemplate, might well depress the spirits of Mrs. Graham, and
                     fill her with deep and anxious solicitude. For some weeks previous to the
                     evening on which our story opens, Mr. Graham had shown strong symptoms almost
                     every day—symptoms apparent, however, in the family, only to the eye of his
                     wife—of drunkenness. Towards the close of each day, as the hour for his return
                     from business drew near her feelings would become oppressed under the fearful
                     apprehension that when he came home, it would be in a state of intoxication.
                     This she dreaded on many accounts. Particularly was she anxious to conceal the
                     father's aberrations from his children. She could not bear the thought that
                     respect for one now so deeply honoured by them, should be diminished in their
                     bosoms. She felt, too, keenly, the reproach that would rest upon his name,
                     should the vice that was now entangling, obtain full possession of him, and
                     entirely destroy his manly, rational freedom of action. Of consequences to<figure>

                     <pb n="-177" xml:id="VAC5627-00000090"/> herself and children, resulting from
                     changed external circumstances, she did not dream. Her husband's wealth was
                     immense; and, therefore, even if he should so far abandon himself as to have to
                     relinquish business, there would be enough, and more than enough, to sustain
                     them in any position in society they might choose to occupy.</p>
                  <p>On the occasion to which we have already referred, her heart was throbbing with
                     suspense as the hour drew nigh for his return, when, sooner than she expected
                     him, Mr. Graham opened the hall-door, and instead of entering the parlour, as
                     usual, proceeded at once to his chamber. The quick ear of his wife detected
                     something wrong in the sound of his footsteps—the cause she knew too well. Oh,
                     how deeply wretched she felt, though she strove all in her power to seem
                     unmoved while in the presence of her children! Anxious to know the worst, she
                     soon retired, as has been seen, from the parlours, and went up to the chamber
                     above. Alas! how sadly were her worst fears realized! The loved and honoured
                     partner of many happy years, the father of her children, lay before her,
                     slumbering, heavily, in the sleep of intoxication. It seemed, for a time, as if
                     she could not bear up under the trial. While seated, far from the bed-side,
                     brooding in sad despondency over the evil that had fallen upon them—an evil of
                     such a character that it had never been feared—it seemed to her that she could
                     not endure it. Her thoughts grew bewildered, and reason for a time seemed
                     trembling. Then her mind settled into a gloomy calmness that, was even more
                     terrible, for it had about it something approaching the hopelessness of
                     despair.</p>
                  <p>Thoughts of her children at last aroused her, as the gathering night darkened
                     the chamber in which she sat, and she endeavoured to rally herself, and to
                     assume a calmness that she was far from feeling. A reason would have to be
                     given for the father's non-appearance at the tea-table. That could easily be
                     done. Fatigue and a slight indisposition had caused him to lie down: and as he
                     had fallen asleep, it was thought best not to awaken him. Such a tale was
                     readily told, and as readily received. The hardest task was to school her
                     feelings into submission, and so control the expression of her face,<pb
                        n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5627-00000091"/> and the tone of her voice, as to
                     cause none to suspect that there was anything wrong.</p>
                  <p>To do this fully, however, was impossible. Her manner was too evidently
                     changed; and her face wore too dreamy and sad an expression to deceive her
                     daughters, who inquired, with much tenderness and solicitude, whether she was
                     not well, or whether anything troubled her.</p>
                  <p>"I am only a little indisposed," was her evasive reply to her children's kind
                     interrogatories.</p>
                  <p>"Can't I do something for you?" inquired Ellen, with an earnest affection in
                     her manner.</p>
                  <p>"No, dear," was her mother's brief response; and then followed a silence,
                     oppressive to all, which remained unbroken until the tea things were
                     removed.</p>
                  <p>"Alfred is again away at tea-time," Mrs. Graham at length said, as they all
                     arose from the table.</p>
                  <p>"He went out this afternoon with Charles Williams," Mary replied.</p>
                  <p>"Did he?" the mother rejoined quickly, and with something of displeasure in her
                     tone.</p>
                  <p>"Yes. Charles called for him in his buggy about four o'clock, and they rode out
                     together. I thought you knew it."</p>
                  <p>"No. I was lying down about that time."</p>
                  <p>"You do not seem to like Charles Williams much."</p>
                  <p>"I certainly do not, Anna, as a companion for Alfred. He is too fond of
                     pleasure and sporting, and I am very much afraid will lead your brother
                     astray."</p>
                  <p>"I never saw anything wrong about him, Ma."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps not. But I have learned to be a much closer observer in these matters
                     than you, Mary. I have seen too many young men at Alfred's age led away, not to
                     feel a deep and careful solicitude for him."</p>
                  <p>As the subject seemed to give their mother pain, her daughters did not reply;
                     and then another, and still more troubled silence followed.</p>
                  <p>A chill being thrown thus over the feelings of all, the family separated at an
                     early hour. But Mrs. Graham did not retire to bed. She could not, for she was
                     strangely uneasy about her son. It was about twelve o'clock when Alfred came
                     in. His mother opened her door as he passed it, to speak to him—but her tongue
                     refused to give utterance to the words that trembled upon it. He, too, was
                     intoxicated!</p>
                  <p>Brief were the hours given to sleep that night, and troubled the slumber that
                     locked her senses in forgetfulness. On the next morning, the trembling hand of
                     her husband, as he lifted his cup to his lips, and the unrefreshed and jaded
                     appearance of her son, told but too plainly their abuse of nature's best
                     energies. With her husband, Mrs. Graham could not bring herself to speak upon
                     the subject. But she felt that her duty as a mother was involved in regard to
                     her son, and therefore she early took occasion to draw him aside, and
                     remonstrate against the course of folly upon which he was entering.</p>
                  <p>"You were out late last night, Alfred," she said, in a mild tone.</p>
                  <p>"I was in at twelve, Ma."</p>
                  <p>"But that was too late, Alfred."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, Ma. Other young men are out as late, and even later, every
                     night," the young man said, in a respectful tone. "I rode out with Charles
                     Williams in the afternoon, and then went with him to a wine party at
                     night."</p>
                  <p>"I must tell you frankly, Alfred, that I like neither your companion in the
                     afternoon, nor your company in the evening."</p>
                  <p>"You certainly do not object to Charles Williams. He stands as high in society
                     as I do."</p>
                  <p>"His family is one of respectability and standing. But his habits, I fear,
                     Alfred, are such as will, ere long, destroy all of his title to respectful
                     estimation."</p>
                  <p>"You judge harshly," the young man said, colouring deeply.</p>
                  <p>"I believe not, Alfred. And what is more, I am convinced that you stand in
                     imminent danger from your association with him."</p>
                  <p>"How?" was the quick interrogatory.</p>
                  <p>"Through him, for instance, you were induced to go to a wine party last
                     night."</p>
                  <p>"Well?"</p>
                  <p>"And there induced to drink too much."</p>
                  <p>"Mother!"</p>
                  <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5627-00000092"/>
                  <p>"I saw you when you came in, Alfred. You were in a sad condition."</p>
                  <p>For a few moments the young man looked his mother in the face, while an
                     expression of grief and mortification passed over his own.</p>
                  <p>"It is true," he at length said, in a subdued tone, "that I did drink to
                     excess, last evening. But do not be alarmed on that account. I will be more
                     guarded, in future. And let me now assure you, most earnestly, that I am in no
                     danger: that I am not fond of wine. I was led to drink too much, last evening,
                     from being in a company where wine was circulated as freely as water. I thought
                     you looked troubled, this morning, but did not dream that it was on my account.
                     Let me, then, urge you to banish from your mind all fears in regard to me."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot banish such fears, my son, so long as I know that you have dangerous
                     associates. No one is led off, no one is corrupted suddenly."</p>
                  <p>"But I do not think that I have dangerous associates."</p>
                  <p>"I am sure you have, Alfred. If they had not been such, you would not have been
                     led astray, last night. Go not into the way of temptation. Shun the very
                     beginnings of evil. Remember Pope's warning declaration:— <q>
                        <l>"'Vice, to be hated, needs but to be seen,' &amp;c."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Indeed, indeed, Ma, you are far too serious about this matter."</p>
                  <p>"No, my son, I cannot be!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, perhaps not. But, as I know the nature of my associations far better
                     than you possibly can, you must pardon me for thinking that they involve no
                     danger. I have arrived to years of discretion, and certainly think that I am,
                     or at least ought to be, able to judge for my self."</p>
                  <p>There was that in the words and tone of the young man, that made the mother
                     feel conscious that it would be no use for her to urge the matter further, at
                     that time. She merely replied—</p>
                  <p>"For your mother's sake, Alfred, guard yourself more carefully, in future."</p>
                  <p>It is wonderful, sometimes, how rapidly a downward course is run. The barrier,
                     against which the waters have been driven for years, is rapidly washed away, so
                     soon as even the smallest breach is made. A breach had been made in Mr.
                     Graham's resolution to be only a sober drinker of intoxicating liquors; and the
                     consequence was, that he had less power to resist the strong inclination to
                     drink, that had become almost like a second nature to him. A few weeks only
                     elapsed, before he came home so drunk as to expose himself in the street, and
                     before his children and servants, in a most disgusting and degrading
                     manner.</p>
                  <p>Terrible indeed was the shock to his children—especially to Mary, Ellen and
                     Anna. His sudden death could not have been a more fearful affliction. Then,
                     they would have sorrowed in filial respect and esteem, made sacred by an event
                     that would embalm the memory of their father in the permanent regard of a whole
                     community: now, he stood degraded in their eyes; and they felt that he was
                     degraded in the eyes of all. In his presence they experienced restraint, and
                     they looked for his coming with a shrinking fear. It was, indeed, an awful
                     affliction—such as few can realize in imagination; and especially for them, as
                     they occupied a conspicuous position in society, and were conscious that all
                     eyes were upon them, and that all tongues would be busy with the story of their
                     father's degradation.</p>
                  <p>It is wonderful, we have said, how rapidly a downward course is sometimes run.
                     In the case of Mr. Graham, many circumstances combined to hasten his ruin. It
                     was nearly a year after he had given way to the regular indulgence of drink, so
                     far as to be kept almost constantly in a state of half-intoxication through the
                     business hours of almost every day, that he received news of the loss of a
                     vessel richly laden with teas from China. At the proper time he presented the
                     requisite documents to his underwriters, and claimed the loss, amounting, on
                     ship and cargo, to one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. On account of
                     alleged improper conduct on the part of the captain, united with informality in
                     the papers, the underwriters refused to pay the loss. A suit at law was the
                     consequence, in which the underwriters were sustained. An appeal was made, but
                     the same result followed-thus sweeping away, at a single blow, property to the
                     amount of over one hundred thousand dollars. During the progress<pb n="182-183"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000093"/> of the trial, Mr. Graham was much excited, and
                     drank more freely than ever. When the result was finally ascertained, he sank
                     down into a kind of morose inactivity for some months, neglecting his large and
                     important business, and indulging, during the time, more deeply than ever in
                     his favourite potations. It was in vain that his distressed family endeavoured
                     to rouse him into activity. All their efforts were met by an irritability and a
                     moroseness of temper so unlike what he had been used to exhibit towards them,
                     that they gave up all idea of influencing him in despair.</p>
                  <p>A second heavy loss, of nearly equal amount, altogether consequent upon this
                     neglect of business, seemed to awaken up the latent energies of his character,
                     and he returned to himself with something of his former clear-sighted energy of
                     character. But his affairs had already become, to him, strangely entangled. The
                     machinery of his extensive operations had been interrupted; and now, in
                     attempting to make the wheels move on again, it was too apparent that much of
                     it had become deranged, and the parts no longer moved in harmonious action with
                     the whole. The more these difficulties pressed upon him, the deeper did he
                     drink, as a kind of relief, and, in consequence, the more unfit to extricate
                     himself from his troubles did he become. Every struggle, like the efforts of a
                     large animal in a quagmire, only tended to involve him deeper and deeper in
                     inextricable embarrassment.</p>
                  <p>This downward tendency continued for about three years, when his family was
                     suddenly stunned by the shock of his failure. It seemed impossible for them to
                     realize the truth—and, indeed, almost impossible for the whole community to
                     realize it. It was only three or four years previous that his wealth was
                     estimated, and truly so, at a million and a half. He was known to have met with
                     heavy losses, but where so much could have gone, puzzled every one. It seems
                     almost incredible that any man could have run through such an estate by
                     mismanagement, in so brief a period. But such was really the case. Accustomed
                     to heavy operations, he continued to engage in only the most liberal
                     transactions, every loss in which was a matter of serious moment. And towards
                     the last, as his mind grew more and more bewildered in consequence of is
                     drinking deeper and deeper, he scarcely got up a single voyage, that did not
                     result in loss; until, finally, he was driven to an utter abandonment of
                     business—but not until he had involved his whole estate in ruin.</p>
                  <p>The beautiful family mansion on Chestnut-street had to be given up—the carriage
                     and elegant furniture sold under the hammer, while the family retired,
                     overwhelmed with distress, to an humble dwelling in an obscure part of the
                     city.</p>
                  <p>Seven years from the day on which Mrs. Graham and her children were thus thrown
                     suddenly down from their elevation, and driven into obscurity, that lady sat
                     alone, near the window of a meanly-furnished room in a house on the suburbs of
                     the city, overlooking the Schuylkill. It was near the hour of sunset. Gradually
                     the day declined, and the dusky shadows of evening fell gloomily around. Still
                     Mrs. Graham sat leaning her head upon her hand, in deep abstraction of mind.
                     Alas! seven years had wrought a sad change in her appearance, and a sadder one
                     in her feelings. Her deeply-sunken eye, and pale, thin face, told a tale of
                     wretchedness and suffering, whose silent appeal made the very heart ache. Her
                     garments, too, were old and faded, and antiquated in style.</p>
                  <p>She sat thus for about half-an-hour, when the door of the room was opened
                     slowly, and a young woman entered, carrying on her arm a small basket. She
                     seemed, at first sight, not over twenty-three or four years of age; but, when
                     observed more closely, her hollow cheek, pale face, and languid motions,
                     indicated the passage of either many more years over her head, or the painful
                     inroads of disease and sorrow. Mrs. Graham looked up, but did not speak, as the
                     young woman entered, and, after placing her basket on a table, laid aside her
                     bonnet and faded shawl.</p>
                  <p>"How did you find Ellen, to-day?" she at length said.</p>
                  <p>"Bad enough!" was the mournful reply. "It makes my heart ache, Ma, whenever I
                     go to see her."</p>
                  <p>"Was her husband at home?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and as drunk and ill-natured as ever."</p>
                  <p>"How is the babe, Mary?"</p>
                  <p>"Not well. Dear little innocent creature! it has seen the light of this dreary
                     world in an evil time. Ellen has scarcely any milk for it; and I could not get
                     it to feed,<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5627-00000094"/> try all I could. It
                     nestles in her breast, and frets and cries almost incessantly, with pain and
                     hunger. Although it is now six weeks old, yet Ellen seems to have gained
                     scarcely any strength at all. She has no appetite, and creeps about with the
                     utmost difficulty. With three little children hanging about her, and the
                     youngest that helpless babe, her condition is wretched indeed. It would be bad
                     enough, were her husband kind to her. But cross, drunken and idle, scarcely
                     furnishing his family with food enough to sustain existence, her life with him
                     is one of painful trial and suffering. Indeed, I wonder, with her sensitive
                     disposition and delicate body, how she can endure such a life for a week."</p>
                  <p>A deep sigh, or rather moan, was the mother's only response. Her daughter
                     continued,</p>
                  <p>"Bad as I myself feel with this constant cough, pain in my side, and weakness,
                     I must go over again to-morrow and stay with her. She ought not to be left
                     alone. The dear children, too, require a great deal of attention that she
                     cannot possibly give to them."</p>
                  <p>"You had better bring little Ellen home with you, had you not, Mary? I could
                     attend to her much better than Ellen can."</p>
                  <p>"I was thinking of that myself, Ma. But you seemed so poorly, that I did not
                     feel like saying anything about it just now."</p>
                  <p>"O yes. Bring her home with you to-morrow evening, by all means. It will take
                     that much off of poor Ellen's hands."</p>
                  <p>"Then I will do so, Ma; at least if Ellen is willing," Mary said, in a lighter
                     tone—the idea of even that relief being extended to her overburdened sister
                     causing her mind to rise in a momentary buoyancy.</p>
                  <p>"Anna is late to-night," she remarked, after a pause of a few moments.</p>
                  <p>As she said this, the door opened, and the sister of whom she spoke
                     entered.</p>
                  <p>"You are late to-night, Anna," her mother said.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, rather later than usual. I had to take a few small articles home for a
                     lady, after I left the store, who lives in Sixth near Spring Garden."</p>
                  <p>"In Sixth near Spring Garden!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. The lad who takes home goods had gone, and the lady was particular about
                     having them sent home this evening."</p>
                  <p>"Do you not feel very tired?"</p>
                  <p>"Indeed I do," the poor girl said, sinking into a chair. "I feel, sometimes, as
                     if I must give up. No one in our store is allowed to sit down from morning till
                     night. The other girls don't appear to mind it much; but before evening, it
                     seems as if I must drop to the floor. But I won't complain," she added,
                     endeavouring to rally herself, and put on a cheerful countenance. "How have you
                     been to-day, Ma?"</p>
                  <p>"If you won't complain, I am sure that I have no right to, Anna."</p>
                  <p>"You cannot be happy, of course, Ma; that I know too well. None of us, I fear,
                     will ever be again happy in this world!" Anna said, in a tone of despondency,
                     her spirits again sinking.</p>
                  <p>No one replied to this; and a gloomy silence of many minutes followed—a quiet
                     almost as oppressive as the stillness that reigns in the chamber of death. Then
                     Mary commenced busying herself about the evening meal.</p>
                  <p>"Tea is ready, Ma and Anna," she at length said, after their frugal repast had
                     been placed upon the table.</p>
                  <p>"Has not Alfred returned yet?" Anna asked.</p>
                  <p>"No," was the brief answer.</p>
                  <p>"Hadn't we better wait for him?"</p>
                  <p>"He knows that it is tea-time, and ought to be here, if he wants any," the
                     mother said. "You are tired and hungry, and we will not, of course, wait."</p>
                  <p>The little family, three in number, gathered around the table, but no one eat
                     with an appetite of the food that was placed before them. There were two vacant
                     places at the board. The husband and son—the father and brother—where were
                     they?</p>
                  <p>In regard to the former, the presentation of a scene which occurred a few weeks
                     previous will explain all. First, however, a brief review of the past seven
                     years is necessary. After Mr. Graham's failure in business, he gave himself up
                     to drink, and sunk, with his whole family, down into want and obscurity with
                     almost unprecedented<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5627-00000095"/> rapidity. He
                     seemed at once to become strangely indifferent to his wife and children—to lose
                     all regard for their welfare. In fact, he had become, in a degree, insane from
                     the sudden reverses which had overtaken him, combined with the bewildering
                     effects of strong drinks, under whose influence he was constantly
                     labouring.</p>
                  <p>Thus left to struggle on against the pressure of absolute want, suddenly and
                     unexpectedly brought upon them, and with no internal or external resources upon
                     which to fall promptly back, Mrs. Graham and her daughters were for a time
                     overwhelmed with despair. Alfred, to whom they should have looked for aid,
                     advice, and sustenance, in this hour of severe trial, left almost entirely to
                     himself, as far as his father had been concerned, for some two years, had sunk
                     into habits of dissipation from which even this terrible shock had not the
                     power to arouse him. Having made himself angry in his opposition to, and
                     resistance of, all his mother's admonitions, warnings, and persuasions, he
                     seemed to have lost all affection for her and his sisters. So that a sense of
                     their destitute and distressed condition had no influence over him—at least,
                     not sufficient to arouse him into active exertions for their support. Thus were
                     they left utterly dependent upon their own resources—and what was worse, were
                     burdened with the support of both father and brother.</p>
                  <p>The little that each had been able to save from the general wreck, was, as a
                     means of sustenance, but small. Two or three gold watches and chains, with
                     various articles of <choice>
                        <sic>jewelery</sic>
                        <corr>jewelry</corr>
                     </choice>, fancy work-boxes, and a number of trifles, more valued than
                     valuable, made up, besides a remnant of household furniture, the aggregate of
                     their little wealth. Of course, the mother and daughters were driven, at once,
                     to some expedient for keeping the family together. A boarding-house, that first
                     resort of nearly all destitute females, upon whom families are dependent,
                     especially of those who have occupied an elevated position in society, was
                     opened, as the only means of support that presented itself. The result of this
                     experiment, continued for a year and a half, was a debt of several hundred
                     dollars, which was liquidated by the seizure of Mrs. Graham's furniture. But
                     worse than this, a specious young man, one of the boarders, had won upon the
                     affections of Ellen, and induced her to marry him. He, too soon, proved himself
                     to have neither a true affection for her, nor to have sound moral principles.
                     He was, moreover, idle, and fond of gay company.</p>
                  <p>On the day that Mrs. Graham broke up her boardinghouse, Markland, her
                     daughter's husband, was discharged from his situation as clerk, on account of
                     inefficiency. For six months previous, the time he had been married, he had
                     paid no boarding, thus adding himself as a dead weight to the already
                     overburdened family. As he had no house to which he could take Ellen, he very
                     naturally felt himself authorized to share the house to which the distressed
                     family of her mother retired, seemingly regardless of how or by whom the food
                     he daily consumed was provided.</p>
                  <p>But Mrs. Graham was soon reduced to such extremities, that he was driven off
                     from her, with his wife, and forced to obtain employment by which to support
                     himself and her. As for the old man, he had managed, in the wreck of affairs,
                     to retain a large proportion of his wines, and other choice liquors; and these,
                     which no pressure of want in his family could drive him to sell, afforded the
                     means of gratifying his inordinate love of drink. His clothes gradually became
                     old and rusty—but this seemed to give him no concern. He wandered listlessly in
                     his old business haunts, or lounged about the house in a state of half stupor,
                     drinking regularly all through the day, at frequent periods, and going to bed,
                     usually, at nights, in a state of stupefaction.</p>
                  <p>When the boarding-house was given up, poor Mrs. Graham, whose health and
                     spirits had both rapidly declined in the past two years, felt utterly at a loss
                     what to do. But pressing necessities required immediate action.</p>
                  <p>"Anna, child, what are we to do," she said, rousing herself, one evening, while
                     sitting alone with her daughters in gloomy abstraction.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, Ma, I am as much at a loss as you are. I have been thinking and
                     thinking about it, until my min— has become beclouded and bewildered."</p>
                  <p>"I have been thinking, too," said Mary, "and it strikes me that Anna and I
                     might do something in the way of<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5627-00000096"/>
                     ornamental needlework. Both of us, you know, are fond of it."</p>
                  <p>"Do you think that we can sell it, after it is done?" Anna asked, with a lively
                     interest in her tone.</p>
                  <p>"I certainly do. We see plenty of such work in the shops; and they must buy it,
                     of course."</p>
                  <p>"Let us try, then, Mary," her sister said with animation.</p>
                  <p>A week spent in untiring industry, produced two elegantly wrought capes, equal
                     to the finest French embroidery.</p>
                  <p>"And, now, where shall we sell them?" Anna inquired, in a tone of concern.</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. —— would, no doubt, buy them; but I, for one, cannot bear the thought of
                     going there."</p>
                  <p>"Nor I. But, driven by necessity, I believe that I could brave to go there, or
                     anywhere else, even though I have not been in Chestnut-street for nearly two
                     years."</p>
                  <p>"Will you go, then, Mary?" Anna asked, in an earnest, appealing tone.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Anna, as you seem so shrinkingly reluctant, I will go."</p>
                  <p>And forthwith Mary prepared herself; and rolling up the two elegant capes,
                     proceeded with them to the store of Mrs. ——, in Chestnut-street. It was crowded
                     with customers when she entered, and so she shrunk away to the back part of the
                     store, until Mrs. —— should be more at leisure, and she could bargain with her
                     without attracting attention. She had stood there only a few moments,—when her
                     ear caught the sound of a familiar voice—that of Mary Williams, one of her
                     former most intimate associates. Her first impulse was to spring forward, but a
                     remembrance of her changed condition instantly recurring to her, she turned
                     more away from the light, so as to effectually conceal herself from the young
                     lady's observation. This she was enabled to do, although Mary Williams came
                     once or twice so near as to brush her garments. How oppressively did her heart
                     beat, at such moments! Old thoughts and old feelings came rushing back upon
                     her, and in the contrast they occasioned between the past and the present, she
                     was almost overwhelmed with despondency. Customer after customer came in, as
                     one and another retired, many of whose faces were familiar to Mary as old
                     friends and acquaintances. At last, however, after waiting nearly two hours,
                     she made out to get an interview with Mrs. ——.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Miss, what do you want?" asked that personage, as Mary came up before
                     her where she still stood at the counter, for she had observed her waiting in
                     the store for some time. Mrs. —— either did not remember, or cared not to
                     remember, her old customer, who had spent, with her sisters, many hundreds of
                     dollars in her store, in times past.</p>
                  <p>"I have a couple of fine wrought capes that I should like to sell," Mary said,
                     in a timid, hesitating voice, unrolling, at the same time, the articles she
                     named.</p>
                  <p>"Are they French?" asked Mrs. ——, without pausing in her employment of rolling
                     up some goods, to take and examine the articles proffered her.</p>
                  <p>"No, ma'am; they are some of my own and sister's work."</p>
                  <p>"They won't do, then, Miss. Nothing in the way of fine collars and capes will
                     sell, unless they are French."</p>
                  <p>Mary felt chilled at heart as Mrs. —— said this, and commenced slowly rolling
                     up her capes, faint with disappointment. As she was about turning from the
                     counter, Mrs. —— said, in rather an indifferent tone,</p>
                  <p>"Suppose you let me look at them."</p>
                  <p>"I am sure you will think them very beautiful," Mary replied, quickly unrolling
                     her little bundle. "They have been wrought with great care."'</p>
                  <p>"Sure enough, they are quite well done," Mrs. —— said, coldly, as she glanced
                     her eyes over the capes. "Almost equal in appearance to the French. But they
                     are only domestic; and domestic embroidered work won't bring scarcely anything.
                     What do you ask for these?"</p>
                  <p>"We have set no price upon them; but think that they are richly worth five or
                     six dollars apiece."</p>
                  <p>"Five or six dollars!" ejaculated Mrs. ——, in well feigned surprise, handing
                     back; suddenly, the capes. "O! no, Miss;—American goods don't bring arty such
                     prices."</p>
                  <p>"Then what will you give for them, Madam?"</p>
                  <p>"If you feel like taking two dollars apiece for them,<pb n="192-193"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000097"/> you can leave them. But I am not particular,"
                     Mrs. —— said, in a careless tone.</p>
                  <p>"Two dollars!" repeated Mary, in surprise. "Surely, Mrs. ——, they are worth
                     more than two dollars apiece!"</p>
                  <p>"I'm not at all anxious to give you even that for them," said Mrs. ——. "Not at
                     all; for I am by no means sure that I shall ever get my money back again."</p>
                  <p>"You will have to take them, then, I suppose," Mary replied, in a disappointed
                     and desponding tone.</p>
                  <p>"Very well, Miss, I will give you what I said." And Mrs. —— took the capes, and
                     handed Mary Graham four dollars in payment.</p>
                  <p>"If we should conclude to work any more, may we calculate on getting the same
                     money for them?"</p>
                  <p>"I can't say positively, Miss; but I think that you may calculate on that price
                     for as many as you will bring."</p>
                  <p>Mary took the money, and turned away. It was only half an hour after, that Mrs.
                     —— sold one of them, as "French," for twelve dollars!</p>
                  <p>Sadly, indeed, were the sisters disappointed at this result. But nothing better
                     offering that they could do, they devoted themselves, late and early, to their
                     needles, the proceeds of which rarely went over five dollars per week; for two
                     years they continued to labour thus.</p>
                  <p>At the end of that period, Anna sunk under her self-imposed task, and lay ill
                     for many weeks. Especially forbidden by the physician, on her recovery, to
                     enter again upon sedentary employments, Anna cast earnestly about her for some
                     other means whereby to earn something for the common stock. Necessity, during
                     the past two years, had driven her frequently into business parts of the city
                     for the purchase of materials such as they used. Her changed lot gave her new
                     eyes, and her observations were necessarily made upon a new class of facts. She
                     had seen shop-girls often enough before, but she had never felt any sympathy
                     with them, nor thought of gaining any information about them. They might
                     receive one dollar a week, or twenty, or work for nothing—it was all the same
                     to her. Even if any one had given her correct information on the subject, she
                     would have forgotten it in ten minutes. But now, it was a matter of interest to
                     know how much they could make—and she had obtained a knowledge of the fact,
                     that they earned from three to six and seven dollars a week, according to their
                     capacities or the responsibility of their stations.</p>
                  <p>When, therefore, her shattered health precluded her from longer plying her
                     needle, much as she shrank from the publicity and exposure of the position, she
                     resolutely set about endeavouring to obtain a situation as saleswoman in some
                     retail dry-goods store. One of the girls in Mrs. ——'s store, who knew all about
                     her family, and deeply commiserated her condition, interested herself for her,
                     and succeeded in getting her a situation, at four dollars a week, in
                     Second-street. To enter upon the employment that now awaited her, was indeed a
                     severe trial; but she went resolutely forward, in the way that duty called.</p>
                  <p>The sudden change from a sedentary life to one of activity, where she had to be
                     on her feet all day, tried her feeble strength severely. It was with difficulty
                     that she could sometimes keep up at all, and she went home frequently at night
                     in a burning fever. But she gradually acquired a kind of power of endurance,
                     that kept her up. She did not seem to suffer less, but had more strength, as it
                     were, to bear up, and hold on with unflinching resolution.</p>
                  <p>Thus she had gone on for two or three years, at the time she was again
                     introduced, with her mother and sister, to the reader.</p>
                  <p>As for their father, his whole stock of liquors had been exhausted for nearly
                     two years, and, during that time, he had resorted to many expedients to obtain
                     the potations he so much loved. Finally, he became so lost to all sense of
                     right or feeling, that he would take money, or anything he could carry off from
                     the house, for the purpose of obtaining liquor. This system had stripped them
                     of many necessary articles, as well as money, and added very greatly to their
                     distress, as well as embarrassments.</p>
                  <p>At last, everything that he could take had been taken, and as neither his wife
                     nor daughters would give him any money, his supply of stimulus was cut off, and
                     he became almost mad with the intolerable desire that was burning within him
                     for the fiery poison which had robbed him of rationality and freedom.</p>
                  <p>"Give me some money!" he said, in an excited tone, to his wife, coming in
                     hurriedly from the street, one day<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5627-00000098"/>
                     about this time. His face was dark and red, as if there were a congestion of
                     the blood in the veins of the skin, while his hands trembled, and his whole
                     frame was strongly agitated. Those who had been familiar with that old man,
                     years before, would hardly have recognized him now, in his old worn and faded
                     garments.</p>
                  <p>"I have no money for you," his wife replied. "You have already stripped us of
                     nearly everything."</p>
                  <p>"Buy me some brandy, then."</p>
                  <p>"No. I cannot do that either. Brandy has cursed you and your family. Why do you
                     not abandon it for ever?"</p>
                  <p>"I must have brandy, or die! Give me something to drink, in the name of
                     heaven!"</p>
                  <p>The wild look that her husband threw upon her, alarmed Mrs. Graham, and she
                     hesitated no longer, but handed him a small piece of money. Quick as thought,
                     he turned away and darted from the house.</p>
                  <p>It was, perhaps, after the lapse of about half an hour that he returned. He
                     opened the door, when he did so, quietly, and stood looking into the room for a
                     few moments. Then he turned his head quickly from the right to the left,
                     glancing fearfully behind him once or twice. In a moment or two afterwards he
                     started forward, with a strong expression of alarm upon his countenance, and
                     seated himself close beside Mrs. Graham, evidently in the hope of receiving her
                     protection from some dreaded evil.</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter?" quickly exclaimed Mrs. Graham, starting up with a
                     frightened look.</p>
                  <p>"It is really dreadful!" he said. "What can it all mean?"</p>
                  <p>"What is dreadful?" asked his wife, her heart throbbing with an unknown
                     terror.</p>
                  <p>"There! Did you ever see such an awful sight? Ugh!" and he shrunk behind her
                     chair, and covered his eyes with his hands.</p>
                  <p>"I see nothing, Mr. Graham," his wife said, after a few moments of hurried
                     thought, in which she began to comprehend the fact that her husband's mind was
                     wandering.</p>
                  <p>"There is nothing here that will hurt you, father," Mary added, coming up to
                     him, as her own mind arrived at a conclusion similar to her mother's.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing to hurt me!" suddenly screamed the old man, springing to his feet, and
                     throwing himself backwards half across the room; "and that horrible creature
                     already twining himself about my neck, and strangling me! Take it off! take it
                     off!" he continued, in a wild cry of terror, making strong efforts to tear
                     something away from his throat.</p>
                  <p>"Take it off'! Why don't you take it off! Don't you see that it is choking me
                     to death! Oh! oh! oh!" (uttered in a terrific scream.)</p>
                  <p>Panting, screaming and struggling, he continued in this state of awful alarm,
                     vainly endeavouring to extricate himself from the toils of an imaginary
                     monster, that was suffocating him, until he sank exhausted to the floor.</p>
                  <p>Happily for his alarmed and distressed family, two or three neighbours, who had
                     been startled by the old man's screams,—came hurriedly in, and soon
                     comprehended the nature of his aberration. A brief consultation among
                     themselves determined them, understanding, as they did perfectly, the condition
                     of the family, and his relation to them, to remove him at once to the
                     Alms-House, where he could get judicious medical treatment, and be out of the
                     sight and hearing of his wife and children.</p>
                  <p>One of them briefly explained to Mrs. Graham, and Mary, the nature of his
                     mental affection, and the absolute necessity that there was for his being
                     placed where the most skilful and judicious management of his case could be
                     had. After some time, he gained their reluctant consent to have him taken to
                     the Alms-House. A carriage was then obtained, and he forced into it, amid the
                     tears and remonstrances of the wife and daughter, who had already repented of
                     their acquiescence in what their judgment had approved. Old affection had
                     rushed back upon their hearts, and feelings became stronger than reason.</p>
                  <p>It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when this occurred. Early on the
                     next morning, Mrs. Graham, with Mary and Anna, went out to see him. Their
                     inquiries about his condition were vaguely answered, and with seeming
                     reluctance, or as it appeared to them, with indifference. At length the matron
                     of the institution asked them to go with her, and they followed on, through
                     halls and galleries, until they came to a room, the door of which she opened,
                     with a silent indication for them to enter.</p>
                  <p>They entered alone. Everything was hushed, and the<pb n="196-197"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000099"/> silence that of the chamber of death. In the
                     centre of the room lay the old man. A single glance told the fearful tale. He
                     was dead! Dead in the pauper's home! Seven years before, a millionaire—now
                     sleeping his last sleep in the dead-room of an Alms-House, and his beggared
                     wife and children weeping over him in heart-broken and hopeless sorrow.</p>
                  <p>From that time the energies of Mary and Anna seemed paralyzed; and it was only
                     with a strong effort that Mrs. Graham could rouse herself from the stupor of
                     mind and body that had settled upon her.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Graham and her two daughters had nearly finished their evening meal, at
                     the close of the day alluded to some pages back, when the sound of rapidly
                     hurrying footsteps was heard on the pavement. In a moment after, a heavy blow
                     was given just at their door, and some one fell with a groan against it. The
                     weight of the body forced it open, and the son and brother rolled in upon the
                     floor, with the blood gushing from a ghastly wound in his forehead. His
                     assailant instantly fled. Bloated, disfigured, in coarse and worn clothing, how
                     different, even when moving about, was he from the genteel, well-dressed young
                     man of a few years back! Idleness and dissipation had wrought as great a change
                     upon him as it had upon his father, while he was living. Now he presented a
                     shocking and loathsome appearance.</p>
                  <p>The first impulse of Mary was to run for a physician, while the mother and Anna
                     attempted to stanch the flow of blood, that had already formed a pool upon the
                     floor. Assistance was speedily obtained, and the wound dressed; but the young
                     man remained insensible. As the physician turned from the door, Mrs. Graham
                     sank fainting upon her bed. Over-tried nature could bear up no longer.</p>
                  <p>"Doctor, what do you think of him?" asked the mother, anxiously, three days
                     after, as the physician came out of Alfred's room. Since the injury he had
                     received, he had lain in a stupor, but with much fever.</p>
                  <p>"His case, Madam, is an extremely critical one. I have tried in vain to control
                     that fever."</p>
                  <p>"Do you think him very dangerous, Doctor?" Mary asked, in a husky voice.</p>
                  <p>"I certainly do. And, to speak to you the honest truth, have, myself, no hope
                     of his recovery. I think it right that you should know this."</p>
                  <p>"No hope, Doctor!" Mrs. Graham said, laying her hand upon the physician's arm,
                     while her face grew deadly pale. "No hope!—My only son die thus!—O! Doctor, can
                     you not save him?"</p>
                  <p>"I wish it were in my power, Madam. But I will not flatter you with false
                     hopes. It will be little less than a miracle should he survive."</p>
                  <p>The mother and sisters turned away with an air of hopelessness from the
                     physician, and he retired slowly, and with oppressed feelings.</p>
                  <p>When they returned to the sick chamber, a great change had already taken place
                     in Alfred. The prediction of the physician, it was evident to each, as all bent
                     eagerly over him, was about to be too surely and too suddenly realized. His
                     face, from being slightly flushed with fever, had become sunken, and ghastly
                     pale, and his respiration so feeble that it was almost imperceptible.</p>
                  <p>The last and saddest trial of this ruined family had come. The son and brother,
                     for whom now rushed back upon their hearts the tender and confiding affection
                     of earlier years, was lingering upon life's extremest verge. It seemed that
                     they could not give him up. They felt that, even though he were neglectful of
                     them, they could not do without him. He was a son and brother; and, while he
                     lived, there was still hope of his restoration. The strength of that hope,
                     entertained by each in the silent chambers of affection, was unknown before—its
                     trial revealed its power over each crushed and sinking heart.</p>
                  <p>But the passage of each moment brought plainer and more palpable evidence of
                     approaching dissolution. For about ten minutes he had lain so still, that they
                     were suddenly aroused by the fear that he might be already dead Softly did the
                     mother lay her hand upon his forehead. Its cold and clammy touch sent an icy
                     thrill to her heart Then she bent her ear to catch even the feeblest breath—but
                     she could distinguish none.</p>
                  <p>"He is dead!" she murmured, sinking down and burying her face in the
                     bed-clothes.</p>
                  <p>The cup of their sorrow was, at last, full—full and running over!</p>

                  <head type="sub">PART SECOND.</head>
                  <p>STUNNED by this new affliction, which seemed harder to bear than any of the
                     terrible ones that had gone before, Mrs. Graham sunk into a state of half
                     unconsciousness; but Anna still lingered over the insensible body of her
                     brother, and though reason told her that the spirit had taken its everlasting
                     departure, her heart still hoped that it might not be so,—that a spark yet
                     remained which would rekindle.</p>
                  <p>The pressure of her warm hand upon his cold, damp forehead, mocked her hopes.
                     His motionless chest told of the vanity of her fond anticipations of seeing his
                     heart again quicken into living activity. And yet, she could not give him up.
                     She could not believe that he was dead. As she still hung over him, it seemed
                     to her that there was a slight twitching of the muscles about the neck. How
                     suddenly did her heart bound and throb until its strong pulsations pained her!
                     Eagerly did she bend down upon him, watching for some more palpable sign of
                     returning animation. But nothing met either her eye or her ear that
                     strengthened the newly awakened hope.</p>
                  <p>After waiting, vainly, for some minutes, until the feeble hope she had
                     entertained began to fail, Anna stepped quickly to the mantelpiece, and lifted
                     from it a small looking-glass, with which she returned to the bedside. Holding
                     this close to the face of her brother, she watched the surface with an eager
                     anxiety that almost caused the beating of her heart to cease. As a slight mist
                     slowly gathered upon the glass and obscured its surface, Anna cried out with a
                     voice that thrilled the bosoms of her mother and sister—</p>
                  <p>"He lives! he lives!" and gave way to a gush of tears.</p>
                  <p>This sudden exclamation, of course, brought Mrs. Graham and Mary to the
                     bedside, who instantly comprehended the experiment which Anna had been making
                     and understood the result. The mother, in turn, with trembling hands, lifted
                     the mirror, and held it close to the face of her son. In a moment or two, its
                     surface was obscured, plainly indicating that respiration, though almost
                     imperceptible, was still going on,—that life still lingered in the feeble body
                     before them.</p>
                  <p>Gradually, now, the flame that had well-nigh gone out, kindled up again, but so
                     slowly, that for many hours the mother and sisters were in doubt whether it
                     were really brightening or not. The fever that had continued for several days,
                     exhausting the energies of the young man's system, had let go its hold, because
                     scarcely enough vital energy remained for it to subsist upon. In its
                     subsidence, life trembled on the verge of extinction. But there was yet
                     sufficient stamina for it to rally upon; and it did rally, and gradually, but
                     very slowly, gained strength.</p>
                  <p>In an earnest spirit of thankfulness for this restoration of Alfred, did the
                     mother and sisters look up to the Giver of all good, and with tearful devotion
                     pray that there might ensue a moral as well as a physical restoration. For
                     years, they had not felt towards him the deep and yearning tenderness that now
                     warmed their bosoms. They longed to rescue him, not for their sakes, but for
                     his own, from the horrible pit and the miry clay into which he had fallen.</p>
                  <p>"O, if we could but save him, sister!" Anna said, as she sat conversing with
                     Mary, after all doubt of his recovery had been removed. "If we could only do
                     some. thing to restore our brother to himself, how glad I should be!"</p>
                  <p>"I would do anything in my power," Mary replied, "and sacrifice everything that
                     it was right to sacrifice, if, by so doing, I could help Alfred to conquer his
                     besetting evils. I cannot tell you how I feel about it. It seems as if it would
                     break my heart to have him return again<pb n="200-201"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000101"/> into his old habits of life: and yet, what have
                     we to found a hope upon, that he will not so return?"</p>
                  <p>"I feel just as you do about it, Mary," her sister said. "The same yearning
                     desire to save him, and the same hopelessness as to the means."</p>
                  <p>"There is one way, it seems to me, in which we might influence him."</p>
                  <p>"What is that, Mary?"</p>
                  <p>"Let us manifest towards him, fully, the real affection that we feel; perhaps
                     that may awaken a chord in this own bosom, and thus lead him, for our sakes, to
                     enter upon a new course of life."</p>
                  <p>"We can at least try, Mary. It can do no harm, and may result in good."</p>
                  <p>With the end of his reformation in view, the two sisters, during his
                     convalescence, attended him with the most assiduous and affectionate care. The
                     moment Anna would come home from the store at night, she would repair with a
                     smiling countenance to his bedside, and although usually so fatigued as to be
                     compelled to rally her spirits with an effort, she would seem so interested and
                     cheerful and active to minister in some way to his pleasure, that Alfred began
                     to look forward every day as the evening approached, with a lively interest,
                     for her return. This Mary observed, and it gave her hope.</p>
                  <p>Three weeks soon passed away, when Alfred was so far recovered as to be able to
                     walk out.</p>
                  <p>"Do not walk far, brother," Mary said, laying her hand gently upon his arm, and
                     looking him with affectionate earnestness in the face. "You are very weak, and
                     the fatigue might bring on a relapse."</p>
                  <p>"I shall only walk a little way, Mary," he replied, as he opened the door and
                     went out.</p>
                  <p>Neither the mother nor sister could utter the fear that each felt, lest Alfred
                     should meet with and fall in temptation before he returned. This fear grew
                     stronger and stronger, as the minutes began to accumulate, and lengthen to an
                     hour. A period of ten or fifteen minutes was as long as they had any idea of
                     his remaining away. Where could he be? Had he been taken sick; or was he again
                     yielding to the seductions of a depraved and degrading appetite? The suspense
                     became agonizing to their hearts, as not only one, but two, and even three
                     hours passed, bringing the dim twilight, and yet he returned not.</p>
                  <p>In the meantime, the young man, whose appearance the careful hand of Mary and
                     her sister had been rendered far superior to what it had been for years past,
                     went out from his mother's humble dwelling, and took his way slowly down one of
                     the streets, leading to the main portion of the city, with many thoughts of a
                     painful character passing through his mind. The few weeks that he had been
                     confined to the house, and in constant association with his mother, and one or
                     both of his sisters, who were at home, had startled his mind into reflection.
                     He could not but contrast their constant and affectionate devotion to him, with
                     his own shameful and criminal neglect of them. Conceal her real feelings as she
                     would, it did not escape his notice, that when Anna came home at night, she was
                     so much exhausted as to be hardly able to sit up; and as for Mary, often when
                     she dreamed not that he was observing her, had he noticed her air of languor
                     and exhaustion, and her half-stifled expression of pain,—as she bent resolutely
                     over her needle-work. Never before had he felt so indignant towards Ellen's
                     husband for his neglect and abuse of her, his once favourite sister; and,
                     indeed, the favourite of the whole family.</p>
                  <p>It was, to his own mind, a mystery how he ever could have sunk so low, and
                     become so utterly regardless of his mother and sisters.</p>
                  <p>"Wretch! wretch! miserable wretch that I am!" he would, sometimes, mentally
                     exclaim, turning his face to the wall as he lay reviewing, involuntarily, his
                     past life. Uniformly it happened, that following such a crisis in his feelings,
                     would be some affectionate word or kind attention from Mary or his mother,
                     smiting upon his heart with emotions of the keenest remorse.</p>
                  <p>It was under the influence of such feelings that he went out on the afternoon
                     just alluded to. Still, no settled plan of reformation had been formed in his
                     mind, for the discouraging question would constantly arise while pondering
                     gloomily over his condition and the condition of the family.</p>
                  <p>"What can I do?" To this, he could find no satisfactory answer. Three<pb
                        n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5627-00000102"/> or four years of debasing
                     drunkenness, had utterly separated him from those who had it in their power to
                     encourage and strengthen his good desires,—and to put him in the way of
                     providing for himself and his family, by an industrious application to some
                     kind of business.</p>
                  <p>He had walked slowly on, in painful abstraction, for about five minutes, when a
                     hand was laid on his arm, and a familiar voice said—</p>
                  <p>"Is this you, Graham! Where in the name of Pluto have you been, for the last
                     three weeks? Why, how blue you look about the gills! Havn't been sick, I
                     hope?"</p>
                  <p>"Indeed I have, Harry," Alfred replied, in a feeble voices. "It came very near
                     being all over with me."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! Well, what was the matter?"</p>
                  <p>Raising his hat, and displaying a long and still angry-looking wound on the
                     side of his head, from which the hair had been carefully cut away, he said—</p>
                  <p>"Do you see that?"</p>
                  <p>"I reckon I do."</p>
                  <p>"Well, that came very near doing the business for me."</p>
                  <p>"How did it happen?"</p>
                  <p>"I hardly know, myself. I was drunk, I suppose, and quarrelled with some one,
                     or insulted some one in the street—and this was the consequence."</p>
                  <p>"Really, Graham, you have made a narrow escape."</p>
                  <p>"Havn't I? It kept me in bed for nearly three weeks, and now, I can just totter
                     about. This is the first time I have been outside of the house since it
                     happened."</p>
                  <p>"You certainly do look weak and feeble enough," replied his old friend and
                     crony, who added, in a moment after,</p>
                  <p>"But come! take a drink with me at the tavern across here. You stand in need of
                     something."</p>
                  <p>"No objection, and thank you," Alfred rejoined, at once moving over towards a
                     well-known, low tavern, quenching in imagination a morbid thirst that seemed
                     instantly created, by a draught of sweetened liquor.</p>
                  <p>"What will you take?" asked his friend, as the two came up to the counter.</p>
                  <p>"I'll take a mint sling," Alfred replied.</p>
                  <p>"Two mint slings," said his companion, giving his orders to the bar-keeper.</p>
                  <p>"Hallo, Graham! Is this you?" exclaimed one or two loungers, coming forward,
                     and shaking him heartily by the hand. "We had just made up our minds that you
                     had joined the cold-water army."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" suddenly ejaculated Graham, an instant consciousness of what he was,
                     where he was, and what he was about to do, flashing over his mind. "I wish to
                     heaven your conclusion had been true!"</p>
                  <p>This sudden charge in his manner, and his earnestly, indeed solemnly expressed
                     wish, were received with a burst of laughter.</p>
                  <p>"Here Dan," said one, to the bar-keeper, "havn't you a pledge for him to
                     sign."</p>
                  <p>"O, yes! Bring a pledge! Bring a pledge! Has no one a pledge?" rejoined
                     another, in a tone of ridicule.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, here is one," said a man in a firm tone, entering the shop at the moment.
                     "Who wants to sign the pledge?"</p>
                  <p>"I do!" Graham said, in a calm voice.</p>
                  <p>"Then here it is," the stranger replied, drawing a sheet of paper from his
                     pocket, and unrolling it.</p>
                  <p>"Give me a pen Dan," Alfred said, turning to the barkeeper.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, then, and I won't," retorted that individual, "I'm not going to lend a
                     stick to break my own head."</p>
                  <p>"O, never mind, young man, I can supply pen and ink," said the stranger,
                     drawing forth a pocket inkstand.</p>
                  <p>Alfred eagerly seized the pen that was offered to him, and instantly subscribed
                     the total abstinence pledge.</p>
                  <p>"Another fool caught!" sneered one.</p>
                  <p>"Ha! ha! ha! What a ridiculous farce!" chimed in another.</p>
                  <p>"He'll be rolling in the gutter before three days, feeling upwards for the
                     ground," added a third.</p>
                  <p>"Why, I don't believe he can see through a ladder now;" the first speaker said,
                     with his contemptuous sneer. "Look here, mister," to the stranger who had
                     appeared so opportunely. "This is all gammon! He's been fooling you."</p>
                  <p>"Come along, my friend," was all the stranger said,<pb n="204-205"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000103"/> drawing his arm within that of the penitent
                     young man, as he did so,—"this is no place for you."</p>
                  <p>And the two walked slowly out, amid the laughter, sneers, and open ridicule of
                     the brutal company. Once again in the open air, Alfred breathed more
                     freely.</p>
                  <p>"O, sir," he said, grasping the hand of the individual who had appeared so
                     opportunely—"you have saved me from my last temptation, into which I was led so
                     naturally, that I had not an idea of danger. If I had fallen then, as I fear I
                     should have fallen but for you, I must have gone down, rapidly, to
                     irretrievable ruin. How can I express to you the grateful emotions that I now
                     feel?"</p>
                  <p>"Express them not to me, young man," the stranger said, in a solemn voice; "but
                     to him, who in his merciful providence, sent me just at the right moment to
                     meet your last extremity. Look up to him, and, whenever tempted, let your
                     conscious weakness repose in his strength, and no evil power can prevail
                     against you. Be true to the resolution of this hour—<emph>to your
                     pledge</emph>—to those who have claims upon you, for such, I know there must
                     be, and you shall yet fill that position of usefulness in society, which no one
                     else but you can occupy. And now let me advise you to go home, and ponder well
                     this act, and your future course. No matter how dark all may now seem, light
                     will spring up. If you are anxious to walk in a right path, and to minister to
                     those who have claims upon you, the way will be made plain. This encouragement
                     I can give you with confidence; for twelve months ago, <emph>I</emph> trembled
                     on the brink of ruin, as <emph>you</emph> have just been trembling.
                        <emph>I</emph> was once a slave to the same wild infatuation that has held
                     you in bondage. Hope, then, with a vigorous hope, and that hope will be a
                     guarantee for your future elevation!"</p>
                  <p>And so saying, the stranger shook the hand of Alfred heartily, and, turning,
                     walked hastily away.</p>
                  <p>The young man had proceeded only a few paces when he observed his old friend
                     and companion, Charles Williams, driving along towards him. No one had done so
                     much towards corrupting his morals, and enticing him away from virtue, as that
                     individual. But he had checked himself in his course of dissipation, long
                     before, while Alfred had sunk rapidly downward. Years had passed since any
                     intercourse had taken place between them, for their condition in life had long
                     been as different as their habits. Charles had entered into business with his
                     father, and was now active and enterprising, increasing the income of the firm
                     by his energy and industry.</p>
                  <p>His eye rested upon Graham, the moment he came near enough to observe him.
                     There was something familiar about his gait and manner, that attracted the
                     young man's attention. At first, he did not distinguish, through the disguise
                     that sickness and self-imposed poverty had thrown over Alfred, his old
                     companion. But, suddenly, as he was about passing, he recognised him, and
                     instantly reined up his horse.</p>
                  <p>"It is only a few minutes since I was thinking about you, Alfred," he said.
                     "How are you? But you do not look well. Have you been sick?"</p>
                  <p>"I have been very ill, lately," Alfred Graham replied, in a mournful tone;
                     former thoughts and feelings rushing back upon him in consequence of this
                     unexpected interview, and quite subduing him.</p>
                  <p>"I am really sorry to hear it," the young man said, sympathizingly. "What has
                     been the matter?"</p>
                  <p>"A slow fever. This is the first time I have been out for weeks."</p>
                  <p>"A ride, then, will be of use to you. Get up, and let me drive you out into the
                     country. The pure air will benefit you, I am sure."</p>
                  <p>For a moment or two, Alfred stood irresolute. He could not believe that he had
                     heard aright.</p>
                  <p>"Come," urged Williams. "We have often ridden before, and let us have one more
                     ride, if we should never go out again together. I wish to have some talk with
                     you."</p>
                  <p>Thus urged, Alfred, with the assistance of Charles Williams, got up into the
                     light wagon, in which the latter was riding, and in a moment after was dashing
                     off with him behind a spirited horse.</p>
                  <p>It was on the morning of a day, nearly a week previous to this time, that Mary
                     Williams, or rather Mrs. Harwood,—for Anna and Mary Graham's old friend had
                     become a married woman—entered the store of Mrs. —— on Chestnut-street, for the
                     purchase of some goods.<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5627-00000104"/> While one of
                     the girls in attendance was waiting upon her, she observed a young woman,
                     neatly, but poorly clad, whom she had often seen there before, come in, and go
                     back to the far end of the store. In a little while, Mrs. —— joined her, and
                     received from her a small package, handing her some money in return, when the
                     young woman retired, and walked quickly away. This very operation Mrs. Harwood
                     had several times seen repeated before, and each time she had felt much
                     interested in the timid and retiring stranger, a glance at whose face she had
                     never been able to gain.</p>
                  <p>"Who is that young woman?" she asked of the individual in attendance.</p>
                  <p>"She's a poor girl, that Mrs. —— buys fine work from, out of mere charity, she
                     says."</p>
                  <p>"Do you know her name?"</p>
                  <p>"I have heard it, ma'am, but forget it."</p>
                  <p>"Have you any very fine French worked capes, Mrs. ——," asked Mrs. Harwood, as
                     the individual she addressed came up to that part of the counter where she was
                     standing, still holding in her hand the small package which had been received
                     from the young woman. This Mrs. Harwood noticed.</p>
                  <p>"O, yes, ma'am, some of the most beautiful in the city."</p>
                  <p>"Let me see them, if you please."</p>
                  <p>A box was brought, and its contents, consisting of a number of very rich
                     patterns of the article asked for, displayed.</p>
                  <p>"What is the price of this?" asked Mrs. Harwood, lifting one, the pattern of
                     which pleased her fancy.</p>
                  <p>"That is a little damaged," Mrs. —— replied. "But here is one of the same
                     pattern," unrolling the small parcel she had still continued to hold in her
                     hand, "which has just been returned by a lady, to whom I sent it for
                     examination, this morning."</p>
                  <p>"It is the same pattern, but much more beautifully wrought," Mrs. Harwood said,
                     as she examined it carefully. "These are all French, you say?"</p>
                  <p>"Of course, ma'am. None but French goods come of such exquisite fineness."</p>
                  <p>"What do you ask for this?"</p>
                  <p>"It is worth fifteen dollars, ma'am. The pattern is a rich one, and the work
                     unusually fine."</p>
                  <p>"Fifteen dollars! That is a pretty high price, is it not, Mrs. ——?"</p>
                  <p>"O, no, indeed, Mrs. Harwood! It cost me very nearly fourteen dollars—and a
                     dollar is a small profit to make on such articles."</p>
                  <p>After hesitating for a moment or two, Mrs. Harwood said—</p>
                  <p>"Well, I suppose I must give you that for it, as it pleases me."'</p>
                  <p>And she took out her purse, and paid the price that Mrs. —— had asked. She
                     still stood musing by the side of the counter, when the young woman who had
                     awakened her interest a short time before, re-entered, and came up to Mrs. ——,
                     who was near her.</p>
                  <p>"I have a favour to ask, Mrs. ——," she overheard her say, in a half tremulous,
                     and evidently reluctant tone.</p>
                  <p>"Well, what is it?" Mrs. —— coldly asked.</p>
                  <p>"I want six dollars more than I have got, for a very particular purpose. Won't
                     you advance me the price of three capes, and I will bring you in one a week,
                     until I have made it up."</p>
                  <p>"No, miss," was the prompt and decisive answer—"I never pay any one for work
                     not done. Pay beforehand, and never pay, are the two worst kinds of pay!"</p>
                  <p>All this was distinctly heard by Mrs. Harwood, and her very heart ached, as she
                     saw the poor girl turn, with a disappointed air, away, and walk slowly out of
                     the store.</p>
                  <p>"That's just the way with these people," ejaculated Mrs. ——, in affected
                     indignation, meant to mislead Mrs. Harwood, who, she feared, had overheard what
                     the young woman had said. "They're always trying in some way or other, to get
                     the advantage of you."</p>
                  <p>"How so?" asked Mrs. Harwood, wishing to learn all she could about the stranger
                     who had interested her feelings.</p>
                  <p>"Why, you see, I pay that girl a good price for doing a certain kind of work
                     for me, and the money is always ready for her, the moment her work is done.
                     But, not satisfied with that, she wanted me, just now, to advance<pb
                        n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5627-00000105"/> her the price of three weeks' work.
                     If I had been foolish enough to have done it, it would have been the last I
                     ever should have seen of either money, work, or seamstress."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps not," Mrs. Harwood ventured to remark.</p>
                  <p>"You don't know these kind of people as well as I do, Mrs. Harwood. I've been
                     tricked too often in my time."</p>
                  <p>"Of course not," was the quiet reply. Then after a pause,</p>
                  <p>"What kind of sewing did she do for you, Mrs. ——?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing very particular; only a little fine work. I employ her, more out of
                     charity, than anything else."</p>
                  <p>"Do you know anything about her?"</p>
                  <p>"She's old Graham's daughter, I believe. I'm told he died in the Alms-house, a
                     few weeks ago."</p>
                  <p>"What old Graham?" Mrs. Harwood asked, in a quick voice.</p>
                  <p>"Why, old Graham, the rich merchant that was, a few years ago. Quite a
                     tumble-down their pride has had, I reckon! Why, I remember when nothing in my
                     store was good enough for them. But they are glad enough now to work for me at
                     any price I choose to pay them."</p>
                  <p>For a few moments, Mrs. Harwood was so shocked that she could not reply. At
                     length she asked—</p>
                  <p>"Which of the girls was it that I saw here, just now?"</p>
                  <p>"That was Mary."</p>
                  <p>"Do you know anything of Anna?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. She stands in a store in Second-street."</p>
                  <p>"And Ellen?"</p>
                  <p>"Married to a drunken, worthless fellow, who abuses and half starves her. But
                     that's the way; pride must have a fall!"</p>
                  <p>"Where do they live?" pursued Mrs. Harwood.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, and that's more than I know," Mrs. —— replied, tossing her head.</p>
                  <p>Unable to gain any further information, Mrs. Harwood left the store, well
                     convinced that the richly-wrought cape, for which she had paid Mrs. —— fifteen
                     dollars, had been worked by the hands of Mary Graham, for which she received
                     but a mere pittance.</p>
                  <p>Poor Mary returned home disappointed and deeply troubled in mind. She had about
                     three dollars in money, besides the two which Mrs. —— had paid her. If the six
                     she had asked for had only been advanced, as she fondly hoped would be the
                     case, the aggregate sum, eleven dollars, added to three which Anna had saved,
                     would have enabled them to purchase a coat and hat for their brother, who would
                     be ready in a few days to go out. They were anxious to do, this, under the
                     hope, that by providing him with clothes of a more respectable appearance than
                     he had been used to wearing, he would be led to think more of himself, seek
                     better company, and thus be further removed from danger. At her first interview
                     with Mrs. ——, Mary's heart had failed her—and it was only after she had left
                     the store and walked some squares homeward, that she could rally herself
                     sufficiently to return and make her request. It was refused, as has been
                     seen.</p>
                  <p>"Did Mrs. —— grant your request?" was almost the first question that Anna asked
                     of her sister that evening, when she returned from the store.</p>
                  <p>"No, Anna, I was positively refused," Mary replied, the tears rising and almost
                     gushing over her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Then we will only have to do the best we can with what little we have. We
                     shall not be able to get him a new coat; but we can have his old one done up,
                     with a new collar and buttons,—I priced a pair of pantaloons at one of the
                     clothing-stores, in Market-street, as I came up this evening, and the man said
                     three dollars and a half. They looked pretty well. There was a vest, too, for a
                     dollar. I heard one of the young men in the store say, two or three days ago,
                     that he had sold his old hat, which was a very good one, to the hatter, from
                     whom he had bought a new one—or rather, that the hatter had taken the old one
                     on account, valued at a dollar. I asked him a question or two, and learned that
                     many hatters do this, and sell the old hats at the same that they have allowed
                     for them. One of these I will try to get,—even if a good deal worn; it will
                     look far better than the one he has at present."</p>
                  <p>"In that case, then," Mary said, brightening up, "we can still get him fitted
                     up respectably. O, how glad I shall be! Don't you think, sister, that we have
                     good reason to hope for him?"</p>
                  <p>"I try to think so, Mary. But my heart often trembles<pb n="210-211"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000106"/> with fearful apprehensions when I think of his
                     going out among his old associates again. It will be little less than a miracle
                     if he should not fall."</p>
                  <p>"Don't give way to desponding thoughts, sister. Let us hope so strongly for the
                     best, that our very hope shall compass its own fruition. He cannot, he must
                     not, go back!"</p>
                  <p>Anna did not reply. Her own feelings were inclined to droop and despond, but
                     she did not wish to have her sister's droop and despond likewise. One reason
                     for her saddened feelings arose from the fact, that she had a painful
                     consciousness that she should not long be able to retain her present situation.
                     Her health was sinking so rapidly, that it was only by the aid of strong
                     resolutions, which lifted her mind up and sustained her in spite of bodily
                     weakness, that she was at all enabled to get through with her duties. This she
                     was conscious could not last long.</p>
                  <p>On the next morning, when she attempted to rise from her bed, she became so
                     faint and sick that she was compelled to lie down again. The feeling of alarm
                     that instantly thrilled through her bosom, lest she should no longer be able to
                     minister to the wants of her mother, and especially of her brother at this
                     important crisis in his life, acted as a stimulant to exhausted nature, and
                     endowed her with a degree of artificial strength that enabled her to make
                     another and more successful effort to resume her wearying toil.</p>
                  <p>But so weak did she feel, even after she had forced herself to take a few
                     mouthfuls of food at breakfast time, that she lingered for nearly half an hour
                     longer than her usual time of starting in order to allow her system to get a
                     little braced up, so that she could stand the long walk she had to take.</p>
                  <p>"Good by, brother," she said in a cheerful tone, coming up to the bed upon
                     which Alfred lay, and stooping down and kissing him. "You must try and sit up
                     as much as you can to-day."</p>
                  <p>"Good by, Anna. I wish you didn't have to go away and stay so long."</p>
                  <p>To this, Anna could not trust herself to reply. She only pressed tightly the
                     hand she held in her own, and then turned quickly away.</p>
                  <p>It was nearly three quarters of an hour later than the time the different
                     clerks were required to be at the store, when Anna came in, her side and head
                     both paining her badly, in consequence of having walked too fast.</p>
                  <p>"It's three quarters of an hour behind the time," the storekeeper said, with a
                     look and tone of displeasure, as he drew out his watch. "I can't have such
                     irregularity in my store, Miss Graham. This is the third time within a few
                     days, that you have come late."</p>
                  <p>A reply instantly rose to Anna's tongue, but she felt that it would be
                     useless—and would, perhaps, provoke remarks deeply wounding to her feelings.
                     She paused, therefore, only a moment, with a bowed head, to receive her rebuke,
                     and then passed quickly, and with a meek, subdued air, to her station behind
                     the counter. There were some of her fellow-clerks who felt for and pitied
                     Anna—there were others who experienced a pleasure in hearing her reproved.</p>
                  <p>All through that day, with only the respite of some ten or fifteen minutes,
                     when she retired to eat alone the frugal repast of bread and cold meat that she
                     had brought with her for her dinner, did Anna stand behind the shop-man's
                     counter, attending to his customers with a cheerful air and often a smiling
                     countenance. She spoke to no one of the pain in her breast, back, and side; and
                     none of those around her dreamed that, from extreme lassitude, she could
                     scarcely stand beside the counter.</p>
                  <p>To her, suffering as she did, the hours passed slowly and heavily away. It
                     seemed as if evening would never come—as if she would have to yield the
                     struggle, much as she strove to keep up for the sake of those she loved.</p>
                  <p>But even to the weary, the heavy laden, and the prisoner, the slow lingering
                     hours at length pass on, and the moment of respite comes. The shadows of
                     evening at last began to fall dimly around, and Anna retired from her position
                     of painful labour, and took her way homeward. But not even the anticipation of
                     speedily joining those she loved, had power so to buoy up her spirits, that her
                     body could rise above its depressed and weakened condition. Her weary steps
                     were slowly taken, and it seemed to her that she should never be able to reach
                     home. Many, very many depressing thoughts passed through her<pb n="212-213"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000107"/> mind as she proceeded slowly on her homeward
                     way. The condition of her sister Ellen troubled her exceedingly. About
                     one-third of her own and Mary's earnings were required to keep her and her
                     little ones from absolute suffering; and Mary, like herself, she too plainly
                     perceived to be rapidly sinking under her burdens.</p>
                  <p>"What is to be done when we fail, heaven only knows!" she murmured, as a vivid
                     consciousness of approaching extremity arose in her mind.</p>
                  <p>As she said this, the idea of her brother presented itself, with the hope that
                     he would now exert for them a sustaining and supporting energy—that he would be
                     to them at last a brother. But this thought, that made her heart leap in her
                     bosom, she put aside with an audible—</p>
                  <p>"No,—no,—Do not rest on such a feeble hope!"</p>
                  <p>At last her hand was upon the latch, and she lifted it and entered.</p>
                  <p>"I am glad to see you home again, Anna," Alfred said, with an expression of
                     real pleasure and affection; as she came in.</p>
                  <p>"And I am glad to see you sitting up and looking so well, brother," Anna
                     replied, her gloomy thoughts at once vanishing. "How do you feel now?"</p>
                  <p>"O, I feel much better, sister. In a few days I hope I shall be able to go out.
                     But how are you? It seems to me that you do not look well."</p>
                  <p>"I do feel very much fatigued, Alfred," Anna said, while her tone, in spite of
                     her effort to make it appear cheerful, became sad. "We are not permitted in our
                     store to sit down for a moment, and I get so tired by night that I can hardly
                     keep up."</p>
                  <p>"But surely, Anna, you do not stand up all day long."</p>
                  <p>"Yes. Since I left this morning, I have been standing every moment, with the
                     exception of the brief period I took to eat my dinner."</p>
                  <p>This simple statement smote upon the heart of the young man, and made him
                     silent and thoughtful. He felt that, but for his neglect of duty—but for his
                     abandonment of himself to sensual and besotting pleasures, this suffering, this
                     self-devotion need not be.</p>
                  <p>Anna saw that what she had said was paining the mind of her brother, and she
                     grieved that she had been betrayed ed into making any allusion to herself. To
                     restore again the pleased expression to Alfred's countenance, she dexterously
                     changed the subject to a more cheerful one, and was rewarded for her effort by
                     seeing his eye again brighten and the smile again playing about his lips.</p>
                  <p>Instead of sitting down after tea and assisting Mary with her embroidery, as
                     she usually did, Anna took a book and read aloud for the instruction and
                     amusement of all; but most for the sake of Alfred-that he might feel with them
                     a reciprocal pleasure, and thus be enabled to perceive that there was something
                     substantial to fall back upon, if he would only consent to abandon the
                     bewildering and insane delights to which he had given himself up for years. The
                     effect she so much desired was produced upon the mind of her brother. He did,
                     indeed, feel, springing up within him, a new-born pleasure,—and wondered to
                     himself how he could so long have strayed away from such springs of delight, to
                     seek bitter waters in a tangled and gloomy wilderness.</p>
                  <p>When the tender good-night was at last said, and Mary stretched her wearied
                     limbs in silent thoughtfulness beside her sister, there was a feeble hope
                     glimmering in the dark and gloomy abyss of doubt and despondency that had
                     settled upon her mind—a hope that her brother would go forth from his sick
                     chamber a changed man. On this hope, fancy conjured up scenes and images of
                     delight, upon which her mind dwelt in pleased and dreamy abstraction, until
                     sleep stole upon her, and locked up her senses.</p>
                  <p>When she awoke, it was with the same sinking sensation that she had experienced
                     on the morning previous, and, indeed, on every morning for many months past.
                     The remembrance of the rebuke she had received on the day before for being late
                     at her place of business, acted as a kind of stimulant to arouse her to
                     exertion, so as to be able to get off in time. It was, however, a few minutes
                     past the hour when she entered the store, the owner of which looked at his
                     watch, significantly, as she did so.</p>
                  <p>This day passed, as the previous one had, in pain and extreme weariness—and so
                     did the next, and the next, the poor girl's strength failing her too
                     perceptibly. During this time, Alfred's coat had been repaired, a pair of
                        pantaloons<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5627-00000108"/> loons and a vest
                     bought for him, and also a second-hand hat of very respectable appearance—all
                     ready so soon as he should be strong enough to venture out. How anxiously, and
                     yet in fear and trembling, did the sisters look forward to that period, which
                     was to strengthen their feeble hopes, or scatter them to the winds!</p>
                  <p>"I do really feel very ill," Anna said, sinking back upon her pillow, after
                     making an attempt to rise, one morning some four or five days after that on
                     which Mary has been represented as endeavouring to get an advance from Mrs.
                     ——.</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter?" Mary inquired kindly.</p>
                  <p>"My head aches most violently—and grows confused so soon as I attempt to
                     rise."</p>
                  <p>"Then I would lie still, Anna."</p>
                  <p>"No, I must be up, and getting ready to go to the store."</p>
                  <p>"I wouldn't go down to the store, if I were you, Anna. You had better rest for
                     a day."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot afford to lose a day," Anna said, again rising in bed, and sitting
                     upright, until the swimming in her head, that commenced upon the least motion,
                     had subsided. Then she got out upon the floor, and stood for a few moments,
                     while her head seemed reeling, and she every instant about to sink down. In a
                     little while this dizziness went off, but her head throbbed and ached with
                     aggravated violence.</p>
                  <p>At breakfast, she forced herself to swallow a small portion of food, although
                     her stomach loathed it; and then, with trembling limbs and a feeling of
                     faintness, she went out into the open air, and took her way to the store. The
                     fresh breeze, as it fell coolingly on her fevered forehead, revived her in a
                     degree; but long ere she had reached the store her limbs were sinking under her
                     with excessive fatigue.</p>
                  <p>"Late again, miss—" said her employer, as she came in, with a look of stern
                     reproof.</p>
                  <p>"I have not been very well, sir," Anna replied, lifting her pale, languid face,
                     and looking appealingly into the countenance of the store-keeper.</p>
                  <p>"Then you should stay at home altogether, Miss," was is cold response, as he
                     turned away, leaving her to proceed to her accustomed station at the
                     counter.</p>
                  <p>The day happening to be one of unusual activity in business, Anna was kept so
                     constantly busy, that she could not find a moment in which to relieve the
                     fatigue she felt by even leaning on the counter. Customer after customer came
                     and went, and box after box was taken from, and replaced again upon the
                     shelves, in what seemed to her an endless round. Sometimes her head ached so
                     violently, that it was with difficulty she could see to attend correctly to her
                     business. And sometimes she was compelled to steady herself by holding to the
                     counter to prevent sinking to the floor, from a feeling of faintness, suddenly
                     passing over her. Thus she held bravely on, under the feeble hope that her
                     indisposition, as she tried mentally to term it, would wear off.</p>
                  <p>It was about four o'clock in the afternoon that the fever which had been very
                     high all through the day, began to subside. This symptom she noticed with an
                     emotion of pleasure, as indicating a healthy reaction in her system.</p>
                  <p>It was but half an hour after, that she sunk, fainting, to the floor, at her
                     place beside the counter. When the fever abated, exhausted nature gave way.</p>
                  <p>For nearly an hour she remained insensible. And it was nearly two hours before
                     she had so far recovered as to be able to walk, when she was suffered to go
                     away unattended. It was seven o'clock, when, with a face almost as white as
                     ashes, and nearly sinking to the ground with weakness, she arrived at home, and
                     opening the door, slowly entered.</p>
                  <p>"O, Anna! What ails you?" exclaimed her mother.</p>
                  <p>"I feel very sick," the poor girl replied, sinking into a chair. "But where is
                     Alfred?" she asked, in a quicker tone, in which was a strong expression of
                     anxiety, as she glanced her eye about the room, in a vain search for him.</p>
                  <p>"He has walked out," Mary said.</p>
                  <p>"Has he!" ejaculated Anna. "How long has he been away?"</p>
                  <p>"It is now nearly four hours,'" Mary said, endeavouring to conceal the distress
                     she felt, in pity for her sister, who was evidently quite ill.</p>
                  <p>"Four hours!" exclaimed Anna, her face blanching to<pb n="216-217"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000109"/> still whiter hue. "Four hours! And do you not
                     know where he is?"</p>
                  <p>"Indeed we do not, Anna. He went out to take a short walk, and said he would
                     not be gone more than ten or twenty minutes."</p>
                  <p>Anna did not reply, but turned slowly away, and entering her chamber, threw
                     herself exhausted upon her bed, feeling so utterly wretched, that she breathed
                     an audible wish that she might die. In about ten minutes a carriage stopped at
                     the door; and in a moment after, amid the rattling of departing wheels, Alfred
                     entered, looking better and happier than he had looked for a long, long time. A
                     single glance told the mother and sister that all was right.</p>
                  <p>"O, brother! How could you stay away so long?" Mary said, springing to his
                     side, and grasping tightly his arm.</p>
                  <p>"I did not expect, when I walked out, that it would be so long before I
                     returned, Mary," he replied, kissing her cheek affectionately. "But I met with
                     an old, though long estranged friend, who seeing that I had been ill, and
                     needed fresh air, insisted on taking me out into the country in his carriage. I
                     could but consent. I was, however, so weak, as to be obliged to go to bed, when
                     about three miles from the city, and lie there for a couple of hours. But I
                     feel well, very well now; and have some good news to tell you. But where is
                     Anna?"</p>
                  <p>"She has just come in, and gone up to her chamber. I do not think her at all
                     well to-night," Mary said.</p>
                  <p>"Poor girl! She is sacrificing herself for the good of others," Alfred
                     remarked, with tenderness and interest.</p>
                  <p>"Shall I call her down?" Mary asked.</p>
                  <p>"O, yes,—by all means."</p>
                  <p>Mary went up and found her sister lying across the bed, with her face buried in
                     a pillow.</p>
                  <p>"Anna! Anna!" she said, taking hold of her and shaking her gently.</p>
                  <p>Anna immediately arose, and looking wildly around her, muttered something that
                     her sister could not comprehend.</p>
                  <p>"Anna, brother's come home."</p>
                  <p>But she did not seem to comprehend her meaning.</p>
                  <p>The glaring brightness of Anna's eyes, and her flushed cheeks, convinced Mary
                     that all was not right. Stepping to the head of the stairs, she called to
                     Alfred, who instantly came up.</p>
                  <p>"Here is Alfred, Anna," she said, as she re-entered the chamber, accompanied by
                     her brother.</p>
                  <p>For a moment or two, Anna looked upon him with a vacant stare, and then closing
                     her eyes, sunk back upon the bed, murmuring</p>
                  <p>"It is all over—all over."</p>
                  <p>"What is all over, Anna?" her sister asked.</p>
                  <p>"What is all over?" the sick girl responded, in a sharp, quick tone, rising
                     suddenly, and staring at Mary with a fixed look. "Why, it's all over with him!
                     Havn't I drained my heart's blood for him? Havn't I stood all day at the
                     counter for his sake, when I felt that I was dying? But it's all over now! He
                     is lost, and I shall soon be out of this troublesome world!"</p>
                  <p>And then the poor half-conscious girl, covered her face with her hands and
                     sobbed aloud.</p>
                  <p>"Don't do so, dear sister!" Alfred said, pressing up to the bedside, and
                     drawing his arm around her. "Don't give way so! You won't have to stand at the
                     counter any longer. I am Alfred—your brother—your long lost, but restored
                     brother, who will care for you and work for you as you have so long cared for
                     and worked for him. Take courage, dear sister! There are better and happier
                     days for you. Do not give up now, at the very moment when relief is at
                     hand."</p>
                  <p>Anna looked her brother in the face for a few moments, steadily, as her
                     bewildered senses gradually returned, and she began to comprehend truly what he
                     said, and that it was indeed her brother who stood thus before her, and thus
                     appealed to her with affectionate earnestness.</p>
                  <p>"O, Alfred," the almost heart-broken creature, said—as she bent forward, and
                     leaned her head upon his bosom—"Heaven be praised, if you are really and truly
                     in earnest in what you say!"</p>
                  <p>"I am most solemnly in earnest, dear sister!" the young man said, with fervency
                     and emphasis. "Since I saw you this morning, I have signed my name to the total
                     abstinence pledge, and I will die before that pledge shall be broken! And that
                     is not all. I met Charles Williams<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5627-00000110"/>
                     immediately after that act, and have had a long interview with him. He
                     confessed to me that he had often felt that he was much to blame for having
                     first introduced me into dissipated company, and that he now desired to aid me
                     in reforming and assisting my mother and sisters, if I would only try and
                     abandon my past evil courses. I responded most gladly to his generous interest,
                     and he then told me, that if I would enter his and his father's store as a
                     clerk, he would make my salary at once a thousand dollars per annum. Of course
                     I assented to the arrangement with thankfulness. Dear mother! Dear sisters!
                     There is yet, I trust, a brighter day in store for you."</p>
                  <p>"May our Heavenly Father cause these good resolutions to abide for ever, my
                     son!" Mrs. Graham, who had followed her children up stairs, said, with tearful
                     earnestness.</p>
                  <p>"He will cause them to abide, mother, I know that he, will," Alfred
                     replied.</p>
                  <p>Just at that moment some one entered below—immediately after quick feet
                     ascended the stairs, and Ellen bounded into the room.</p>
                  <p>"O, I have such good news to tell!" she exclaimed, panting for breath as she
                     entered. "My husband has joined the reformers! I felt so glad that I had to run
                     over and let you know. O, aint it good news, indeed!" And the poor creature
                     clapped her hands together in an ecstacy of delight.</p>
                  <p>"It is truly good news, my child," Mrs. Graham said, as she drew her arm about
                     the neck of Ellen. "And we too have glad tidings. Alfred has joined them also,
                     and has got a situation at a thousand dollars a year."</p>
                  <p>Ellen, who had always loved her brother, tenderly, notwithstanding his vile
                     habit of life, turned quickly towards him, and flinging her arms about his
                     neck, said while the tears gushed from her eyes,</p>
                  <p>"Dear brother! I have never wholly despaired of this hour. Truly, my cup of joy
                     is full and running over!"</p>
                  <p>It was about eleven o'clock on the next day, as Mary and her mother sat
                     conversing by the side of the bed upon which lay Anna, now too ill to sit up,
                     that a knock was heard below. Mrs. Graham went down and opened the door, when
                     an elegantly dressed lady entered, calling her by name as she did so, at the
                     same time asking for Anna and Mary.</p>
                  <p>She was shown up stairs by the mother, who did not recognise her, although both
                     voice and face seemed familiar. On entering the chamber, Mary turned to her and
                     exclaimed—</p>
                  <p>"Mary Williams! Is it possible!"</p>
                  <p>"And Mary Graham, is it indeed possible that I see you thus!"—(kissing her)"And
                     Anna—is that pale, worn face, the face of my old friend and companion, Anna
                     Graham?" And she bent down over the bed and kissed the lips and cheek of the
                     sick girl, tenderly, while her eyes grew dim with tears. "How changed in a few
                     short years!" she added, as she took a proffered chair. "Who could have
                     dreamed, seven years ago, that we should ever meet thus!"</p>
                  <p>In a short time, as the first shock and surprise of meeting passed off, Mary
                     Williams, or rather Mrs. Harwood, entered into a serious conversation with Mrs.
                     Graham, and her daughters, in reference to the past, the present, and the
                     future. After learning all that she could of their history since their father's
                     failure, which was detailed without disguise by Mary—Anna was too feeble to
                     converse—Mrs. Harwood turned to Mary and asked suddenly—</p>
                  <p>"Do you know this cape, Mary?" alluding to one she had on.</p>
                  <p>"O, yes—very well."</p>
                  <p>"You worked it, did you not?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"For what price?"</p>
                  <p>"Two dollars."</p>
                  <p>"Is it possible! I bought it of Mrs. —— for French, and paid her for it fifteen
                     dollars."</p>
                  <p>"Fifteen dollars!" ejaculated Mary, in surprise. "How shamefully that woman has
                     imposed upon me! During the last two years, I have worked at least one hundred
                     capes for her, each of which brought me in only two dollars. No doubt she has
                     regularly sold them for French goods, at from ten to fifteen dollars
                     apiece."</p>
                  <p>"No doubt of it. I, myself, have bought several from her during that time at
                     high prices, all of which may<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5627-00000111"/> have
                     been worked by you. I saw you in her store a few days ago, but did not
                     recognise you, although your appearance, as it did several times here before,
                     attracted my attention. I had my suspicions, after I had learned from Mrs. ——
                     who you were, that you had wrought this cape, and from having overheard you ask
                     her for an advance of six dollars, as the price of three capes, was pretty well
                     satisfied that two dollars was all you received for it. I at once determined to
                     seek you out, and try to aid you in your severe struggle with the world. It was
                     only last evening that I learned from my brother where you lived—and I also
                     learned, what rejoiced my heart, that there was about occurring a favourable
                     change in your circumstances. If, however, your health should permit, and your
                     inclination prompt you to do so, I will take care that you get a much better
                     price for any capes that you may hereafter work. They are richly worth ten and
                     twelve dollars apiece, and at that price, I have no doubt but that I can get
                     sales for many."</p>
                  <p>"Bless you, Mary! Bless you!" Anna said, smiling through gushing tears, as she
                     rose up in the bed, and bent over towards her old friend and companion. "Your
                     words have fallen upon my heart like a healing balsam!"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Harwood came forward, and received the head of Anna upon her bosom, while
                     she drew an arm round her waist, and bent down and pressed her with tenderness
                     and affection.</p>
                  <p>A better day had truly dawned upon this ruined and deeply afflicted family.
                     Mrs. Harwood and her brother continued to be their steady friends. For a year
                     Alfred remained in his new situation as an efficient clerk, and at the end of
                     that time had his salary advanced. During that period, Mary, and Anna, whose
                     health had become measurably restored, employed all their spare time in
                     embroidery, which, at the excellent prices which, through the aid of Mrs.
                     Harwood, they were enabled to get for their really beautiful work, brought in a
                     handsome addition to their brother's earnings, and this enabled them to live in
                     independence, comfort and respectability. As for Ellen, her husband had become
                     truly a reformed man, and provided for her comfortably.</p>
                  <p>It is now nearly two years since this happy change took place, and there is
                     every appearance that another and a still happier one is about to occur in
                     reference to Anna. Charles Williams is seen very often, of late, riding out
                     with her and attending her to public places. The reader can easily guess the
                     probable result. If there; is not a wedding-party soon, then appearances, in
                     this case at least, are very deceptive.</p>

               <head>THE RUM-SELLER'S DREAM.</head>
               <p>"HOW much have you taken in to-day, Sandy?" asked a modern rum-seller of his
                  bar-tender, after the doors and windows of his attractive establishment were
                  closed for the night.</p>
               <p>"Only about a dollar, Mr. Graves. I never saw such dull times in my life."</p>
               <p>"Only about a dollar! Too bad! too bad! I shall be ruined at this rate."</p>
               <p>"I really don't know what ails the people now. But 'spose it's these blamenation
                  temperance folks that's doin' all the mischief."</p>
               <p>"We must get up something new, Sandy;—something to draw attention to our
                  house."</p>
               <p>"So I've been a thinkin'. Can't we get George Washington Dixon to walk a plank for
                  us? That would draw crowds, you know; and then every feller almost that we got in
                  here would take a drink."</p>
               <p>"We can't get him, Sandy. He's secured over at the ——. But, any how, the people
                  are getting up to that kind of humbuggery; and I'm afraid, that, like the Indian's
                  gun, it would cost in the end more than it came to."</p>
               <p>"Couldn't we get a maremaid?"</p>
               <p>"A mermaid?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a maremaid. You know they had one in town t'other day. It would be a prime
                  move, if we could only do it. We might fix her up here, just back of where I
                  stand, so that every feller who called to see it would have to come up to the bar,
                  front-face. There'd be no backing out then, you know, without ponying up for a
                  drink. No one would be mean enough, after seeing a real maremaid for nothing, to
                  go away without shelling out a fip for a glass of liquor."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Sandy! Where are we to get a mermaid?"</p>
               <p>"Where did they get that one from?"</p>
               <p>"That was brought from Japan; and was a monkey's head and body sewed on to a
                  fish's tail,—so they say;"</p>
               <p>"Well, can't we send to Japan as well as any one? And as to its being a monkey's
                  head on a fish's tail, that's no concern. It would only make a better
                  gull-trap."</p>
               <p>"And wait some two years before it arrived? Humph! If that's the only thing that
                  will save me, I shall go to the dogs in spite of the—"</p>
               <p>"Don't swear, Mr. Graves. It's a bad habit, though I am guilty of it myself,"—the
                  bar-tender said, with vulgar familiarity. "But, why need we wait two years for a
                  maremaid?"</p>
               <p>"Did you ever study geography, Sandy?"</p>
               <p>"Jografy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"What's that?"</p>
               <p>"Why, the maps, at school."</p>
               <p>"I warn't never to school."</p>
               <p>"Then you don't know how far Japan is from here?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly. But 'spose it's some twenty or thirty miles."</p>
               <p>"Twenty or thirty miles! It's t'other side of the world!"</p>
               <p>"O, dear! Then we can't get a maremaid, after all. But 'spose we try and get a
                  live snake."</p>
               <p>"That won't do."</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"A live snake is no great curiosity."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you know we could call it some outlandish name; or say that it was dug
                  up fifty feet below the ground, out of a solid rock, and was now all alive and
                  doin' well."</p>
               <p>"It wouldn't do, Sandy."</p>
               <p>"Now I think it would, prime."</p>
               <p>"It might if these temperance folks were not so confounded thick about here,
                  interfering with a man and preventing him making an honest living. If it wasn't
                  for them, I should be clearing five or ten dollars a day, as easy as nothing."</p>
               <p>"Confound them! I say," was Sandy's hearty response; while he clenched his fist,
                  and ground his teeth together. "If I had a rope round the necks of every mother's
                     son<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5627-00000113"/> of 'em, wouldn't I serve 'em as
                  old Julus Cesar did the Hottentots? Wouldn't I though! But what could they say or
                  do about it, Mr. Graves."</p>
               <p>"They'd pretty quick put it on to us in their temperance papers about the good
                  device we had. They'd talk pretty fast about the serpent that seduced Eve, and all
                  that. No, blast 'em! A snake won't do, Sandy."</p>
               <p>"How will a monkey do?"</p>
               <p>"A monkey might answer, if he was a little cuter than common. But we can't get one
                  handy."</p>
               <p>"Try a band of music."</p>
               <p>"That would soon wear out; and then we should have to get up something else, and
                  the people would suspect us of trying to gull them."</p>
               <p>"Then what is to be done, Mr. Graves? We can never stand it at this rate."</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I don't know." And the rum-seller leaned upon his bar, and looked quite
                  sad and dejected.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what has become of Bill Riley?" he at length asked, rising up with a
                  sigh. "He hasn't been here for a week."</p>
               <p>"Dick Hilton told me to-day that he believed he had joined the teetotallers."</p>
               <p>"I feared as much. He was one of my very best customers; worth a clear dollar and
                  a half a week to me, above the cost of the liquors, the year round. And Tom Jones?
                  Where can he be?"</p>
               <p>"Gone, too."</p>
               <p>"Tom Jones?" in surprise.</p>
               <p>"It's a fact. They got him on the same night Bill Riley was caught."</p>
               <p>"Foolish fellow, to go and throw himself away in that style! Them temperance men
                  will get from him every dollar he can earn, to build Temperance Halls, and get up
                  processions, and buy clothes for lazy, loafing vagabonds, that had a great sight
                  better be sent to the poorhouse. It is too bad. My very blood boils when I think
                  what fools men are."</p>
               <p>"And there's Harry Peters,—Dick Hilton told me that he'd gone, too."</p>
               <p>"Not Harry Peters, surely!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. He hasn't been near our house for several days.</p>
               <p>"Well, something must be done to get up a new set of customers, or we are gone. We
                  must invent some new drink."</p>
               <p>"What shall it be?"</p>
               <p>"O, that's no consequence. The name must be taking."</p>
               <p>"Have you thought of one?"</p>
               <p>"No, Can't you think of something?"</p>
               <p>"Well—Let me see. But I'm sure I don't know what would do."</p>
               <p>"What do you think of 'Bank Stock?' That would attract attention."</p>
               <p>"I can't say that I like it."</p>
               <p>"Or 'Greasers?'"</p>
               <p>"Most too vulgar."</p>
               <p>"So I think myself. Suppose we call it a 'Mummy?'"</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid it wouldn't go. It ought to have 'Imperial,' or 'Nectar,' or something
                  like that about it."</p>
               <p>"O, yes, I see your notion. But they've all been used up long ago. It must be some
                  entirely new name, which, at the same time, will hit a popular idea. As 'Tariff,'
                  or 'Compromise.'"</p>
               <p>"I see now. Well, can't you hammer out something?"</p>
               <p>"I must try. Let me see. How will 'Sub-Treasury' do?"</p>
               <p>"Capital! 'Graves' Sub-Treasury' will be just the thing. You see, the
                  young-fellows will say—'Why, what kind of a new drink is this they've been getting
                  up, down at the Harmony House?'</p>
               <p>"'I don't know—What is it?'</p>
               <p>"'The Sub-Treasury, they call it.'</p>
               <p>"'Have you tried it yet?'</p>
               <p>"'No.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, come, let's give him a call. Novelty, you know, is the order of the
                  day.'</p>
               <p>"That's the way these matters work, Mr. Graves. But how are you going to make
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"I've not thought of that. But anything will do. Liquor tastes good to 'em any way
                  you choose to fix it."</p>
               <p>"True enough. You can leave that part to me. I'll hatch up something that will
                  tickle as it goes down, and<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5627-00000114"/> make 'em
                  wish their throats were a mile long, that they might taste it all the way."</p>
               <p>"Have you tried Graves' new drink yet, Joe?" asked one young man of another, a day
                  or two after the conversation just noted took place.</p>
               <p>"No.—What is it?"</p>
               <p>"Sub-Treasury."</p>
               <p>"Sub-Treasury? That must be something new. I wonder what it is?"</p>
               <p>"I've just been wondering the same thing. Suppose we go down and try it."</p>
               <p>"I was about swearing off from ever tasting another drop of liquor. But, I believe
                  I will try a 'Sub-Treasury' with you, just for the fun of the thing."</p>
               <p>"Well, come along then."</p>
               <p>And so the two started off for the Harmony House.</p>
               <p>"Give us a couple of Sub-Treasuries," said one of them as they entered; and
                  forthwith a couple of glasses filled with mixed liquors, crushed ice, lemonpeel,
                  and snow-white sugar, were prepared, and a straw placed in each, through which the
                  young men "imbibed" the new compound.</p>
               <p>"Really, this is fine, Nelson!" said the one, called Joe, smacking his lips.</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed. You'll make your fortune out of this, Graves."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so?" the pleased liquor-seller responded, with a broad smile of
                  satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"I've not the least doubt of it," Joe, or Joseph Bancroft, said,—"I had half
                  resolved to join the temperance society this day. But your 'Sub-Treasury' has
                  shaken my resolution. I shall never be able to do it now in this world, nor in the
                  next, either, if I can only get you in the same place with me to make
                  'Sub-Treasury!' Ha! ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>"A Sub-Treasury," said another young man, coming up to the bar.</p>
               <p>"Here, landlord, let us have one of your—what do you call 'em? O, Sub-Treasuries!"
                  was the request of another.</p>
               <p>"Hallo, Sandy! What new-fangled stuff is this you've got?" broke in a half-drunken
                  creature, staggering up, and holding on to the bar-railing. "Let us have one, will
                  you?"</p>
               <p>Both Sandy and Graves were now kept as busy as they could be, mixing liquors and
                  serving customers. The advertisement which had been inserted in two or three of
                  the morning papers, in the following words, had answered fully the rum-sellers'
                  expectations.</p>
               <p>"Drop in at the HARMONY HOUSE, and try a 'Sub-Treasury.' 'What is a Sub-Treasury?'
                  you ask. Come and see for yourself, and taste for yourself. Old Graves' word for
                  it, you'll never want anything else to wet your whistle with, as long as you
                  live."</p>
               <p>All through the forenoon the run was kept up steadily, dozens of new faces
                  appearing at the bar, and cheering the heart of the tavern-keeper with the
                  prospect of a fresh set of customers. About two o'clock, succeeded a pause.</p>
               <p>"That works admirably,—don't it, Sandy?" said Mr. Graves, as soon as the bar-room
                  was perfectly clear, for the first time, since morning.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, it does. They havn't given me time to blow. But aint some folks easily
                  gulled?"</p>
               <p>"Easily enough, Sandy. This Sub-Treasury they think something wonderful. But it's
                  only rum after all, by another name, and in a little different form. A 'cobbler,'
                  or a 'julep' has lost its attractions; but get up some new name for an old
                  compound, and you go all before the wind again."</p>
               <p>"I think we might tempt some of the new converts to temperance with this. Bill
                  Riley, for instance."</p>
               <p>"No doubt. I'll see if I can't come across Bill; he is too good a customer to
                  lose."</p>
               <p>And so saying, Mr. Graves retired from the bar-room, to get his dinner, feeling
                  better satisfied with himself than he had been for a long time. After eating
                  heartily, and drinking freely, he went into his handsomely furnished parlour, and
                  reclined himself upon a sofa, thinking still, and with a pleasurable emotion that
                  warmed his bosom, of the success of his expedient to draw custom. He had been
                  lying down, it seemed to him, but a few moments, when a tap at the door, to which
                  he responded with a loud "come in," was followed by the entrance of a thin, pale,
                  haggard-looking creature, her clothes soiled, and<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000115"/> hanging loosely, and in tatters about her
                  attenuated body. By the hand she held a little girl, from whose young face had
                  faded every trace of childhood's happy expression. She, too, was thin and pale,
                  and had a fixed, stony look, of hopeless suffering. They came up to where he still
                  lay upon the sofa, and stood looking down upon him in silence.</p>
               <p>"Who are you? What do you want?" the rum-seller ejaculated, raising himself up
                  with a strange feeling about his heart.</p>
               <p>"The wife and child of one of your victims! He is dying, and wishes to see
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Who is he? What is his name?" asked the tavern-keeper, while his face grew pale,
                  and his lips quivered.</p>
               <p>"William Riley," was the mournful reply.</p>
               <p>"Go home, woman! Go home! I cannot go with you! What good can I do your
                  husband?"</p>
               <p>"You must go! You shall go!" shrieked the wretched being, suddenly grasping the
                  arm of Mr. Graves, with a tight grip, while her hand seemed to burn his arm, as if
                  it were a hand of fire.</p>
               <p>A sudden and irresistible impulse to obey the call of the dying man came over him,
                  and as he arose mechanically, the mother and her child turned towards the door,
                  and he followed after them. On emerging into the street, he became conscious of a
                  great and sudden change in external nature. On retiring from his bar an hour
                  before, the sun was shining in a sky of spotless beauty. Now the heavens were
                  shrouded in dense masses of black clouds that were whirling here and there in
                  immense eddies, or careering across the sky as if driven by a fierce and mighty
                  wind. But below, all was hushed and pulseless as the grave; and the stagnant air
                  felt like the hot vapour over an immense furnace. The tavern-keeper would have
                  paused and returned so soon as he became conscious of this fearful change,
                  portending the approach of a wild storm; but his conductors seemed to know his
                  thoughts; and turning, each fixed upon him a stern and threatening look, whose
                  strange power he could neither resist nor understand.</p>
               <p>"Come," said the mother in a hollow, husky voice; and then turned and moved on
                  again, while the tavern-keeper followed impulsively. They had proceeded thus, for
                  only a few paces, when a fierce light glanced through half the sky, followed by a
                  deafening crash, under the concussion of which the earth trembled as if shaken to
                  its very centre. The tavern-keeper again paused in shrinking irresolution, and
                  again the woman's emphatic,</p>
               <p>"Come!" caused him to follow his guides mechanically.</p>
               <p>Soon the storm burst over their heads, and raged with a wild fury, such as he had
                  never before witnessed. The wind howled through the streets and alleys of the
                  city, with the roar of thunder; while the deep reverberations following every
                  broad sheet of lightning that blazed through the whole circle of the heavens, was
                  as the roar of a dissolving universe. Amid all this, the rain fell like a deluge.
                  But the rum-seller's guides paused not, and he kept steadily onwards after them,
                  shrinking now into the shelter of the houses, and now breasting the fierce storm
                  with a momentary desperate resolution.</p>
               <p>Through street after street, lined on either side with wretched tenements that
                  seemed tottering and just ready to fall, and through alley after alley, where
                  squalid misery had hid itself from the eye of general observation, did they pass,
                  in what seemed to Mr. Graves an interminable succession; At last the woman and her
                  child paused at the door of an old, wretched-looking frame house, that appeared
                  just ready to sink to the ground with decay.</p>
               <p>"This is the place, sir. Come in! Your victim would see you before he dies," the
                  woman said in a deep voice that made a chill run through every nerve, at the same
                  time that she looked him sternly and with an expression of malignant triumph in
                  the face.</p>
               <p>Unable to resist the impulse that drove him onward, the rum-seller entered the
                  house.</p>
               <p>"See there, sir! Look! Behold the work of your own hands!" exclaimed the woman
                  with startling emphasis, as he found himself in a room, with a few old rags in one
                  corner of it for a bed, upon which lay, in the last sad agonies of dissolution,
                  his old customer, Bill Riley, who, he had been that day informed by his
                  bar-keeper, had joined the temperance society.</p>
               <p>"There, sir! See there!" she continued, grasping his<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000116"/> arm, and dragging him up to where the miserable
                  wretch lay. "Look at him!—Bill—Bill!" she continued, stooping down, while she
                  still held tightly the rum-seller's arm, and shaking the dying man. "Bill—Bill!
                  Here he is. You said you wanted to see him! Now curse him, Bill! Curse him with
                  your dying breath!" And the woman's voice rose to a wild shriek.</p>
               <p>The wretch, thus rudely and suddenly called back from the brink of death into a
                  painful consciousness of existence, half rose up, and stared wildly around him for
                  a moment or two.</p>
               <p>"Here he is, Bill! Here he is!" resumed his wife, again shaking him violently.</p>
               <p>"Who? Who?" inquired the dying man.</p>
               <p>"Why, the rum-seller, who robbed you of your hard earnings, that he might roll in
                  wealth and feast daily on luxuries, while your wife and children were starving!
                  Here he is. Curse him now, with your dying breath! Curse him, I say, Bill Riley!
                  Curse him!"</p>
               <p>"Who? Who?" eagerly asked the wretched being, a thrill of new life seeming to
                  flash through his exhausted frame—"Old Graves? Where is he?"</p>
               <p>"Here he is, Bill! Here he is! Don't you see him?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes! I see him now!" And Riley fixed his eyes, that seemed, to the
                  rum-seller, to burn and flash like balls of fire, sending off vivid
                  scintillations, upon him with a long and searching stare.</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes," he continued, "this is old Graves, the rum-seller, who has sent more
                  men to hell, and more widows and orphans to the poor-house, than any other man
                  living. How do you do, sir?" rising up still more in his bed, and grasping the
                  unwilling hand of the tavern-keeper, which he clenched hard, and shook with
                  superhuman strength. "How are you, old fellow? I'm glad to see you once more in
                  this world. We shall have a jolly time in the next, though, shan't we?"</p>
               <p>A smile of malignant triumph flitted for a moment over the livid face of Riley.
                  Then its expression brightened into one of intelligence.</p>
               <p>"Look here," he said, and brought his lips close to the ear of Graves. Then in a
                  deep whisper, he breathed the words,</p>
               <p>"Sub-Treasury!"</p>
               <p>The rum-seller started, suddenly, and grew paler than ever.</p>
               <p>Instantly a loud, unearthly laugh rang through the room, causing the blood to
                  curdle about his heart.</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha! I thought that chord could be touched! Ha! ha! That was a capital
                  idea, wasn't it, old fellow? But you were too late for Bill Riley. You thought the
                  temperance men had him. But that was a little mistake."</p>
               <p>The sweat already stood in large drops on the pale face of the tavern-keeper, and
                  his limbs trembled like the quivering aspen.</p>
               <p>"Horrible!" he murmured, closing his eyes, to shut out the scene.</p>
               <p>"Not half so horrible as the place where I was, just before you came in, Mr.
                  Graves," said Riley in a calmer voice. "And where do you think that was?"</p>
               <p>"In hell, I suppose," replied the rum-seller, with the energy of desperation.</p>
               <p>"Exactly," was the calm reply. "And what do you think I heard and saw there? Let
                  me tell you. I was dead for a little while, and found myself in strange quarters,
                  as you will say, when you get there. I always thought devils had long tails, and
                  cloven feet, horns, and all that kind of thing. But that's a vulgar error. They
                  are nothing but wicked men like you, who in this world have taken delight in
                  injuring others. You will make a first-rate devil! Ha! ha! I heard 'em say so, and
                  wishing you were only there to help them work out their evil intentions.</p>
               <p>"There are a great many little hells there, all grouped into one immense hell,
                  like societies here, grouped into one larger society or nation. And there, as
                  here, every smaller society is engaged in doing some particular thing, and all are
                  in one society who love to do that thing. As for instance, all who, while here,
                  have taken delight in theft, are there associated together, and are all the while
                  busy in inventing reasons to put into the heads of thieves here to justify them in
                  stealing. Murderers, in like manner; and so rum-sellers. They have a hell all
                  filled with rum-sellers there! I was let into it for a little while to see what
                  was going on, and who do you think I saw there.<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000117"/> Why, old Adams, that died about a month ago. The
                  old fellow was as lively as a cricket, and as busy as a bee.</p>
               <p>"'How is that prime old chap, Graves?' he asked of me, as soon as he found out I
                  was there.</p>
               <p>"'I havn't seen him for a week,' I replied. 'I have been sick for that time.'</p>
               <p>"'But he's a rum 'un, though, ain't he?' chuckled Adams. 'Many a scheme he and I
                  have laid to get money out of the grog-drinkers. But he was always ahead of me. I
                  used, in my early days, to feel a little compunction when I saw a clever fellow
                  going to ruin. But it never affected him in the least. All was fish that came into
                  his net. I wish we had him with us. We want just such scheming devils as he to
                  help us devise ways and means to circumvent these temperance men. They'll ruin us,
                  if we don't look out. How were they coming on when you left?'</p>
               <p>"'Carrying everything before them,' I said. 'The rum-sellers are almost driven to
                  their wit's ends for devices to get customers.'</p>
               <p>"'Too bad! Too bad!' ejaculated old Adams. 'I'll turn hell upside down, but what
                  I'll beat them out.'</p>
               <p>"'You'll have to do your prettiest, then, let me tell you, old fellow,' I
                  rejoined, 'for the temperance cause is going with a perfect rush. It is a mighty
                  torrent whose course, neither men nor devils can stay. It moves onward with a
                  power and majesty that astonishes the world,—and onward it will move, until your
                  hell of rum-makers and rum-sellers will not be able to find a single point through
                  which to flow into the world and tempt men with your infernal devices!'</p>
               <p>"O, if you had heard the horrid yell of malignancy which arose, and echoed through
                  the black chamber of that region of wickedness and misery, it would have made you
                  shrink into nothingness with terror. They fairly gnashed on me with their teeth in
                  impotent rage. At length old Adams got upon a whiskey-still—they have such things
                  in hell—the pattern was got from there when introduced here, and made a speech to
                  his associates. From what he said, I found that he had minute information of all
                  that was going on in this region.</p>
               <p>"'Old Graves,' he said—'our very best man, has already been so reduced in his
                  business by this accursed temperance movement, that he has recently thought
                  seriously of giving up. This must not be. We cannot lose him. No mind receives our
                  suggestions more readily than his.—If he gives up, we lose a host. You all know,
                  that our influence on earth is powerless, unless we have men to carry out our
                  plans. If they will not listen to our suggestion—if they will not become our
                  agents, we can do nothing there. As spiritual existences, we cannot affect that
                  which is corporeal, except through the spiritual united with the corporeal—that
                  is, through spiritual bodies in material bodies. In other words, we can act on
                  men's minds, and they can do our works on earth for us. Now, seeing that we can do
                  nothing to stop this temperance movement, except through the self-love of the
                  rum-sellers and rum-makers, it will never do to let old Graves fall. We must help
                  him to some new scheme by which to bring back his diminished custom. Now what
                  shall it be?'</p>
               <p>"'Some device that will call attention to his bar-room, is what is wanted,'
                  remarked one.</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is plain enough,' replied old Adams, who seemed to be a kind of head
                  devil there—'but what shall it be? That's the question!'</p>
               <p>"'Suppose we put him up to getting a woman to walk a plank,' suggested one.</p>
               <p>"'No. That has been tried already; and if it is tried again so soon, these
                  temperance men will cry, humbug!'</p>
               <p>"'How would it do for him to get a pretty girl behind his bar.'</p>
               <p>"'That might do. But then, his wife is a sort of religious woman, and wouldn't let
                  him do it.'</p>
               <p>"Couldn't we induce him to poison her, and so get her out of the way?'</p>
               <p>"'No—That's out of the question. He kind of likes the woman too well for
                  that.'</p>
               <p>"'What, then, do you suggest?'</p>
               <p>"'Some new drink will be the thing. Something that will tickle the ear at the same
                  time that it tickles the palate. It will be a great thing, if, in this matter, we
                  can kill two birds with one stone. Bring back by some new<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000118"/> attraction the wavering ones, and turn the tide of
                  custom in the direction of our very particular friend Mr. Graves.'</p>
               <p>"'Have you thought of a name for it?'</p>
               <p>"'No.'</p>
               <p>"'How would Ambrosia do?' suggested one.</p>
               <p>"'Not at all,' replied old Adams. 'It aint the thing to catch gulls now-a-days.
                  And more than that, it isn't something new.'</p>
               <p>"'What do you think of Harlequinade?'</p>
               <p>"'That might answer; but it's been used, already.'</p>
               <p>"'Fiscal agent?'</p>
               <p>"'The same objection.'</p>
               <p>"'Mummy?'</p>
               <p>"'The same.'</p>
               <p>"'Cobbler?'</p>
               <p>"'Good, but stale.'</p>
               <p>"'Greaser?'</p>
               <p>"'No'—And Adams shook his head emphatically.</p>
               <p>"'Sam Weller?'</p>
               <p>"'Been used already.'</p>
               <p>"'Veto?'</p>
               <p>"'That too.'</p>
               <p>"'Hardware?'</p>
               <p>"'Likewise.'</p>
               <p>"'What do you think of Elevator?'</p>
               <p>"'That might do; but still I can't exactly say that I like it. It should be
                  something to strike the popular idea.'</p>
               <p>"'Sub-Treasury, then?'</p>
               <p>"That's it, exactly! Sub-Treasury—Sub-Treasury. Let it be called Sub-Treasury! And
                  now, as I have more power over Graves than any of you, let me have the managing of
                  him.'</p>
               <p>And so saying, Adams seemed to go away, and remain, for a day or two. When he came
                  back, all the devils gathered around him full of interest to hear of his success.
                  They greeted him, first, with three wild, infernal cheers, full of malignant
                  pleasure, and then asked,</p>
               <p>"'What news? What news from earth?'</p>
               <p>"'Glorious!' was his response. And then another wild yell of triumph went up.</p>
               <p>"'I found Graves,' he went on, 'just the same pliant fool that he has ever been.
                  He fell into my suggestions at once, and on the very next day advertised his
                  'Sub-Treasury.' It took like a charm. I could tell you of a dozen young fellows
                  just about being caught by the teetootallers, who couldn't withstand the new
                  temptation. There was one in particular. His name is Joe Bancroft. Only married
                  about three years, and almost at the bottom of the hill already. On the day before
                  'Sub-Treasury' was announced, he came home sober, for the first time in six
                  months. His wife, a beautiful young girl when he married her, but now a thin,
                  pale, heart-broken creature, sat near a window sewing when he entered. But she did
                  not look up. She heard him come in—but she could not turn her eyes towards him,
                  for her heart always grew sicker whenever she saw the sad changes that drink had
                  wrought upon him.</p>
               <p>"For a few moments Joe stood gazing at his young wife, with a tenderer interest
                  than he had felt for a long time. He saw that she did not look up, and was
                  conscious of the reason.</p>
               <p>"'Sarah,' he at last said, in a voice of affection, coming to her side.</p>
               <p>"'What do you want?' she replied, still without looking up.</p>
               <p>"'Look up at me, Sarah,' he said, in a voice that slightly trembled.</p>
               <p>"Instantly her work dropped from her hands, and she lifted her eyes to the face of
                  her husband, and murmured in a low, sad tone,</p>
               <p>"'What is it you wish, Joseph?'</p>
               <p>"'You look very pale, and very sorrowful, Sarah,' her husband said, with
                  increasing tenderness of tone and manner.</p>
               <p>"It had been so very long since he had spoken to her kindly, or since he had
                  appeared to take any interest in her, that the first tenderly uttered word melted
                  down her heart, and she burst into tears, and leaning her head against him, sobbed
                  long and passionately.</p>
               <p>"With many a kind word, and many a solemn promise of reformation did the husband
                  soothe the stricken heart of his wife, into which a new hope was infused.</p>
               <p>"'I will be a changed man, after this, Sarah,' he said—<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000119"/> 'And then it must go well with us. It seems as if I
                  had been, for the last year, the victim of insanity. I cannot realize how it is
                  possible for any one to abandon himself as I have done; to the neglect of all the
                  most sacred ties and duties that can appertain to us. How deeply—O, how deeply you
                  must have suffered!'</p>
               <p>"'Deeply, indeed, dear husband!—More than tongue can utter,' the young wife
                  replied, in a solemn tone. 'It has seemed, sometimes, as if I must die. Day after
                  day, week after week, and month after month, to see you coming in and going out,
                  as you have done, for ever intoxicated. To have no kind word or look. No rational
                  intercourse with one to whom I had yielded up my heart so confidingly. O, my
                  husband! you know not how sad a trial you have imposed upon your wife!'</p>
               <p>"'Sad—sad, indeed, I am sure it has been, Sarah! But let us try and forget the
                  past. There is bright sunshine yet for us, and it will soon, I trust, fall warmly
                  and cheeringly on our pathway.'</p>
               <p>"All that day Bancroft remained at home with his wife, renewing his assurances of
                  reformation, and laying his plans for the future. I saw all this, and began to
                  fear lest Joe would really get freed from the toils we had, through the
                  rum-sellers, thrown around him—toils, that I had felt, sure would soon cause him
                  to fall headlong down amongst us. I, of course, suggested nothing to him then; for
                  it would have been of little use. Towards night, his wife proposed that he should
                  sign the pledge. I was at his ear in a moment—</p>
               <p>"'That would be too degrading!' I whispered. 'You have not got quite so low as
                  that yet.'</p>
               <p>"'No, Sarah, I do not wish to sign the pledge,' he at once replied.</p>
               <p>"'Why not, dear?'</p>
               <p>"'Because, I have always despised this way of binding oneself down by a written
                  contract, not to do a thing. It is unmanly. My resolution is sufficient. If I say
                  that I will never drink another drop, why I won't. But if I were to bind myself by
                  a pledge not to touch liquor again, I should, never feel a moment's peace, until I
                  had broken it.'</p>
               <p>"These objections I readily infused into his mind, and he at once adopted them as
                  his own. I had power to do so, because I now perceived that his love of drink was
                  so strong, that he did not wish to cut off all chance of ever tasting it again.
                  He, therefore, wanted specious reasons for not signing the pledge, and with these
                  I promptly furnished him!</p>
               <p>"It was in vain that his wife urged him, even with tears and eager entreaties to
                  take the pledge: I was too much for her, and made him firm as a rock in his
                  determination not to sign.</p>
               <p>"On the next morning, he parted with his wife, strong in his resolution to be a
                  reformed man. The pleasant thrill of her parting kiss, the first he had received
                  for more than a year, lingered in his memory and encouraged him to abide by his
                  promise. He passed his accustomed places of resort for liquor, on his way to
                  business, but without the first desire to enter. I noted all this, and kept myself
                  busy about him to detect a moment of weakness. Our friend Graves advertised his
                  'Sub-Treasury' on that morning. I calculated largely on the novelty of the idea to
                  win him off. But, somehow or other, he did not see it. Another young man, one of
                  his companions, did, however:</p>
               <p>"'Have you tried Graves' new drink, yet?' he asked of him about eleven o'clock,
                  while he was under the influence of a pretty strong thirst.</p>
               <p>"'No, what is it?' he replied, with a feeling of lively interest.</p>
               <p>"'Sub-Treasury,' replied his friend.</p>
               <p>"'Sub-Treasury! That must be something new! I wonder what it can be?'</p>
               <p>"Into this feeling of interest in knowing what the new drink could be, I infused a
                  strong desire to taste it.</p>
               <p>"'Suppose we go and try some,' suggested his friend.</p>
               <p>"'There'll not be the least danger,' I whispered in his ear. 'You can try it, and
                  refrain from drinking to excess. The evil has been your drinking too much. There
                  is no harm in moderate drinking. This decided him, and I retired. I knew, if he
                  tasted, that he was gone.'</p>
               <p>"Down he went to the Harmony House;—I was there when he came in. It would have
                  done your hearts good to have seen with what delight he sipped the new beverage<pb
                     n="238 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5627-00000120"/> age,—and to have heard him
                  say, as I did, to Graves;—'I had half resolved to join the temperance society this
                  day,—but your Sub-Treasury has entirely shaken my resolution. I shall never be
                  able to do it now in this world, nor in the next either, if I can only get you in
                  the same place with me to make Sub-Treasury.' And then he laughed with great glee.
                  One, of course, did not satisfy him, nor two, nor three. Before dinner-time he was
                  gloriously drunk, and went staggering home as usual. I could not resist the
                  inclination to see a little of the fun when he presented himself to his wife,
                  whose fond hopes were all in the sky again. Like a bird, she had sung about the
                  house during the morning, her heart so elated that she could not prevent an
                  outward expression of the delight she felt. As the hour drew near for her
                  husband's return, a slight fear would glance through her mind, quickly dismissed,
                  however;—for she could not entertain the idea for a moment that his newly-formed
                  resolution could possibly be so soon broken.</p>
               <p>"At last the hour for his accustomed return arrived. She heard him open the
                  door—and sprung to meet him. One look sufficed to break her heart. Statue-like she
                  stood for a moment or two, and then sunk senseless to the floor.</p>
               <p>"Other matters calling me away, I staid only to see this delightful little scene,
                  and then hurried back to the Harmony House, to see if the run was kept up.
                  Customers came in a steady stream, and crowded the bar of our worthy friend, whose
                  heart was as light as a feather. I saw at least half a dozen come in and sip a
                  glass of Sub-Treasury, who I knew had not tasted liquor for months. I marked them;
                  and shall be about their path occasionally. But the best thing of all that I saw,
                  was a reformer break his pledge. He was, years ago, a noted drunkard, but had been
                  a reformed man for four years. In that time he had broken up several grog-shops,
                  by reforming all their customers, and had got, I suppose, not less than five or
                  six hundred persons to sign the pledge. I had, of course, a particular grudge
                  against him. It was an exceedingly warm day, and he was uncommonly thirsty. He was
                  reading the paper, and came across the 'Sub-Treasury' advertisement.</p>

               <p>"'Ha! ha! What is this, I wonder?' he said, laughing; some new trick of the enemy,
                  I suppose.'</p>
               <p>"'Look here, what is this Sub-Treasury stuff, that Graves advertises this
                  morning?' he said, to a young fellow, a protégé of mine, who was more than a match
                  for him.</p>
               <p>"'A kind of temperance beverage.' I put it into the fellow's head to say.</p>
               <p>"'Temperance beverage?'</p>
               <p>"'Yes. It's made of lemonpeel, and one stuff or other, mixed up with pounded ice.
                  He's got a tremendous run for it. I know half a dozen teetotallers who get it
                  regularly. I saw three or four there to-day, at one time.'</p>
               <p>"'Indeed!'</p>
               <p>"'It's a fact. Come, won't you go down and try a glass? It's delightful.'</p>
               <p>"'Are you in earnest about it?'</p>
               <p>"'Certainly I am. It's one of the most delicious drinks that has been got up this
                  season.'</p>
               <p>"'I don't like to be seen going into such a place.'</p>
               <p>"'O, as to that, there is a fine back entrance leading in from another street,
                  that no one suspects, and a private bar into the bargain. We can go in and get a
                  drink, and nobody will ever see us.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, I don't care if I do,' said the temperance man, 'for I am very dry.'</p>
               <p>"'You're a gone gozzling, my old chap,' I said, as I saw him moving off. 'I
                  thought I'd get you before long.' Sure enough, the moment he took the first
                  draught his doom was sealed. His former desire for liquor came back on him with
                  irresistible power; and before nightfall, he was so drunk that he went staggering
                  along the street, to the chagrin and consternation of the teetotallers; but to the
                  infinite delight of your humble servant.</p>
               <p>"And so saying, that malignant fiend, who, while he inhabited a material body, was
                  called old Billy Adams, stepped down from the still. Then there arose three loud
                  and long cheers, for Graves, and his 'Sub-Treasury,' that echoed and re-echoed
                  wildly through that gloomy prison-house.</p>
               <p>"You're much thought of down there, you see," continued<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000122"/> tinued Riley, with a cold grin of irony.—"Adams
                  says, that if this temperance movement aint stopped soon, they will have to get
                  you among them, and make you head devil in that department. How would you like
                  that, old chap, say? How would you like to go now?"</p>
               <p>As Riley said this, he threw himself forward, and clasped his thin, bony fingers
                  around the neck of the rum-seller, with a strong grip.</p>
               <p>"How would you like to go now, ha?" he screamed fiercely in his ear, clenching his
                  hand tighter and still tighter, while his hot breath melted over the face of
                  Graves in a suffocating vapour. The struggles of the rum-seller were vigorous and
                  terrible—but the dying man held on with a superhuman strength. Soon everything
                  around grew confused, and though still distinctly conscious, it was a
                  consciousness in the mind of the tavern-keeper of the agonies of death. This
                  became so terrible to him that he resolved on one last and more vigorous effort
                  for life. It was made, and the hands of the dying man broke loose. Instantly
                  starting to his feet, the wretched dealer in poison for both the bodies and souls
                  of men, found himself standing in the centre of his own parlour, with the sweat
                  rolling from his face in large drops.</p>
               <p>"Merciful Heaven! And is it indeed a dream?" he ejaculated, panting with terror
                  and exhaustion.</p>
               <p>"A dream—and yet not all a dream," he added, in a few moments, in a sad, low
                  tone.—"In league with hell against my fellow-men! Can it indeed be true? But away!
                  away such thoughts!"</p>
               <p>Such thoughts, however, could not be driven away. They crowded upon his mind at
                  every avenue, and pressed inward to the exclusion of every other idea.</p>
               <p>"But I am not in league with evil spirits to do harm to my fellow-men. I do not
                  wish evil to any one," he argued.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>are</emph> in such evil consociation," whispered a voice within him.
                  "There are but two great parties in the world—the evil and the good. No middle
                  ground exists. You are with one of these—working for the good of your fellow-men,
                  or for their injury. One of these great parties acts in concert with heaven, the
                  other with hell. On the side of one stand arrayed good spirits—on the side of the
                  other evil spirits. Can good spirits be on your side? Would they, for the sake of
                  gain, take the food out of the mouths of starving children? Would they put
                  allurements in a brother's way to entice him to ruin? No! Only in such deeds can
                  evil spirits take delight."</p>
               <p>"Then I am on the side of hell?"</p>
               <p>"There are but two parties. You cannot be on the side of heaven, and do evil to
                  your neighbour."</p>
               <p>"Dreadful thought! In league with infernal spirits to curse the human race! Can it
                  be possible Am I really in my senses?"</p>
               <p>For nearly half an hour did Graves pace the floor backwards and forwards, his mind
                  in a wild fever of excitement. In vain did he try, over and over again, to argue
                  the point against the clearest and strongest convictions of reason. Look at it as
                  he would, it all resolved itself into that one bold and startling position, that
                  he was in league with hell against his fellow-men.</p>
               <p>"And now, what shall I do?" was the question that arose in his mind. "Give up my
                  establishment?"</p>
               <p>At that moment, Sandy, the bar-tender, opened the parlour door, and said with a
                  broad smile—</p>
               <p>"The Sub-Treasury is working wonders again! I'm overrun, and want help."</p>
               <p>"I can't come down, just now, Sandy. I'm not very well. You will have to get along
                  the best you can," Graves replied.</p>
               <p>"I don't know what I shall do then, sir: I can't make 'em half as fast as they are
                  called for."</p>
               <p>"Let half of the people go away then," was the cold reply. "I can't help you any
                  more to-day."</p>
               <p>Sandy thought, as he withdrew, that the "old man" must have suddenly lost his
                  senses. He was confirmed in this idea before the next morning.</p>
               <p>It was past twelve o'clock when the run of custom was over, and Sandy closed up
                  for the night. As soon as this was done, Mr. Graves came in for the first time
                  since dinner.</p>
               <p>"It's been a glorious day for business," Sandy said, rubbing his hands. "I've
                  taken in more, than thirty<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5627-00000123"/> dollars.
                  Lucifer himself must have put the idea into your head."</p>
               <p>"No doubt he did," was the grave reply.</p>
               <p>Sandy stared at this.</p>
               <p>"Didn't you tell me that Bill Riley had joined the temperance society?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did," replied the bar-keeper.</p>
               <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure, I was told so by one that knew."</p>
               <p>"I only wish I was certain of it," was the reply, made half abstractedly. And then
                  the dealer leaned down upon the bar and remained in deep thought for a very long
                  time, to the still greater surprise of Sandy, who could not comprehend what had
                  come over his employer.</p>
               <p>"Aint you well, Mr. Graves," he at length asked, breaking in upon the rum-seller's
                  painful reverie.</p>
               <p>"Well!" he ejaculated, rousing up with a start. "No, I am not well."</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I'm sick," was the evasive response.</p>
               <p>"How, sick?" was Sandy's persevering inquiry.</p>
               <p>"Sick at heart! O, dear! I wish I'd been dead before I opened a grog-shop!"—And
                  the countenance of Mr. Graves changed its quiet, sad expression, to one of intense
                  agony.</p>
               <p>Sandy looked at the tavern-keeper with an air of stupid astonishment for some
                  moments, unable to comprehend his meaning. It was evident to his mind that Mr.
                  Graves had suddenly become crazed about something. This idea produced a feeling of
                  alarm, and he was about retiring for counsel and assistance, when the
                  tavern-keeper roused himself and said:</p>
               <p>"When did you see Bill Riley, Sandy?"</p>
               <p>"I saw him yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Are you certain?" in a quick, eager tone.</p>
               <p>"O yes. I saw him going along on the other side of the street with two or three
                  fellows that didn't look no how at all like rum-bruisers."</p>
               <p>"I was afraid he was dead," Mr. Graves responded to this, breathing more
                  freely.</p>
               <p>"Dead! Why should you think that?" inquired Sandy, still more <choice>
                     <sic>mistified</sic>
                     <corr>mystified</corr>
                  </choice>.</p>
               <p>"I had reason for thinking so," was the evasive reply. A pause of some, moments
                  ensued, when the bar-keeper said—</p>
               <p>"I shall have to be stirring bright and early to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>"Why so?"</p>
               <p>"We're out of sugar and lemons both. That Sub-Treasury runs on them 'ere articles
                  strong."</p>
               <p>"Confound the Sub-Treasury!" Mr. Graves ejaculated, with a strong and bitter
                  emphasis. Sandy stood again mute with astonishment, staring into the
                  tavern-keeper's face.</p>
               <p>"Sandy," Mr. Graves at length said in a calm, resolute tone, "my mind is made up
                  to quit selling liquor."</p>
               <p>"Quit selling liquor, sir!" exclaimed Sandy, more astonished than ever. "Quit
                  selling liquor just at this time, when you have made such a hit?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sandy, I'm going to quit it. I'm afraid that we rum-sellers are on the side
                  of hell."</p>
               <p>"I never once supposed that we were on the side of heaven," the bar-keeper
                  replied, half smiling.</p>
               <p>"Then what side did you suppose we were on?"</p>
               <p>"O, as to that, I never gave the matter a thought. Only, it never once entered my
                  head that we could claim much relationship with heaven. Heaven feeds the hungry
                  and clothes the naked. But we take away both food and clothing, and give only
                  drink. There is some little difference in this, now one comes to think about
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Then I am right in my notion."</p>
               <p>"I'm rather afraid you are, sir. But that's a strange way of thinking."</p>
               <p>"Aint it the true way?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so."</p>
               <p>"I am sure so, Sandy! And that's what makes me say that I'm done selling rum."</p>
               <p>The tavern-keeper did not tell all that was in his mind. He said nothing of his
                  dream, nor of that horrible idea of going to the rum-seller's hell, and becoming a
                  devil, filled with the delight of rendering mankind wretched by deluging the land
                  with drunkenness.</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do then?" asked Sandy.</p>
               <p>"Why, the first thing is to quit rum-selling."</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5627-00000124"/>
               <p>"But what then?"</p>
               <p>"I'm not decided yet;—but shall enter into some kind of business that I can follow
                  with a clear conscience."</p>
               <p>"You'll sell out this stands I suppose. The goodwill is worth three or four
                  hundred dollars."</p>
               <p>"No, Sandy, I will not!" was the tavern-keeper's positive, half indignant reply.
                  "I'll have nothing more to do with the gain of rum-selling. I have too much of
                  that sin on my conscience already."</p>
               <p>"Somebody will come right in, as soon as you move out. And I don't see why you
                  should give any one such an advantage for nothing."</p>
               <p>"I'm not going to move out, Sandy."</p>
               <p>"Then what are you going to do?"</p>
               <p>"Why, one thing—I'm going to shut up this devil's man-trap. And while I can keep
                  possession of the property, it shall never be opened as a dram-shop again."</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with your liquors, Mr. Graves? Sell 'em?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"What then?"</p>
               <p>"Burn 'em. Or let 'em run in the gutter."</p>
               <p>"That I should call a piece of folly."</p>
               <p>"You may call it what you please. But I'll do it notwithstanding. I've received my
                  last dollar for rum. Not another would I touch for all the world!"</p>
               <p>A slight shudder passed through the tavern-keeper's body, as he said this,
                  occasioned by the vivid recollection of some fearful passage in his late
                  dream.</p>
               <p>"You'd better give the liquors to me, Mr. Graves. It would be a downright sin to
                  throw 'em in the gutter, when a fellow might make a good living out of 'em."</p>
               <p>"No, Sandy. Neither you nor anybody else shall ever make a man drunk with the
                  liquor now in this house. It shall run in the gutter. That's settled!"</p>
               <p>When the sun arose next morning, Harmony House was shorn of its attractions as a
                  drinking establishment. All the signs, with their deceptive and alluring devices,
                  were taken down—the shutters closed, and everything indicating its late use
                  removed, excepting a strong smell of liquor, great quantities of which had been
                  poured into the gutters.</p>
               <p>In the course of a few weeks, the house was again re-opened as a hatter-shop, Mr.
                  Graves having resumed his former honest business, which he still follows, well
                  patronized by the temperance men, among whom are Joseph Randolph, and William
                  Riley, the former reclaimed through his active instrumentality.</p>

               <head>HOW TO CURE A TOPER.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001"
                     >*</ref></head>

               <p>I was enjoying my glass of flip, one night, at the little old "Black Horse" that
                  used to stand a mile out of S. ——, (I hadn't joined the great army of teetotallers
                  then,) when a neighboring farmer came in, whose moderation, at least in whisky
                  toddies, was not known unto all men. His name was W——. He was a quiet sort of a
                  man when sober, lively and chatty under the effect of a single glass,
                  argumentative and offensively dogmatic after the second toddy, and downright
                  insulting and quarrelsome after getting beyond that number of drinks. We liked him
                  and disliked him on these accounts.</p>
               <p>On the occasion referred too, he passed through all these changes, and finally
                  sunk off to sleep by the warm stove. Being in the way, and also in danger of
                  tumbling upon the floor, some of us removed him to an old settee, where he slept
                  soundly, entertaining us with rather an unmusical serenade. There were two or
                  three mischievous fellows about the place, and one of them suggested it would be
                  capital fun to black W——'s face, and "make a darkey of him." No sooner said than
                  done. Some lamp-black and oil were mixed together in an old tin cup, and a coat of
                  this paint laid over the face of W——, who, all unconscious of what had been done,
                  slept on as soundly and snored as loudly as ever. Full two hours passed away
                  before he awoke. Staggering up to the bar, he called for another glass of whisky
                  toddy, while we made the old bar-room ring again with our peals of laughter.</p>
               <p>"What are you all laughing at?" he said, as he became aware that he was the
                  subject of merriment, and turning his black face around upon the company as he
                  spoke.</p>
               <note xml:id="note_001">
                  <ref target="#return_001">*</ref>[THE following story, literally true in its leading particulars, was told by a reformed man, who knew W—— very well. In repeating it, I do so in the first person, in order to give it more effect.]
               </note>
               <p>"Give us Zip Coon, old fellow!" called out one of the "boys" who had helped him to
                  his beautiful mask.</p>
               <p>"No! no! Lucy Long! Give us Lucy Long!" cried another.</p>
               <p>"Can't you dance Jim Crow? Try it. I'll sing the 'wheel about and turn about, and
                  do jist so.' Now begin."</p>
               <p>And the last speaker commenced singing Jim Crow.</p>
               <p>W—— neither understood nor relished all this. But the more angry and mystified he
                  became, the louder laughed the company and the freer became their jests. At last,
                  in a passion, he swore at us lustily, and leaving the barroom, in high dudgeon,
                  took his horse from the stable and rode off.</p>
               <p>It was past eleven o'clock. The night was cold, and a ride of two miles made W——
                  sober enough to understand that he had been rather drunk, and was still a good
                  deal "in for it;" and that it wouldn't exactly do for his wife to see him just as
                  he was. So he rode a mile past his house,—and then back again, at a slow trot,
                  concluding that by this time the good woman was fast asleep. And so she was. He
                  entered the house, crept silently up stairs, and got quietly into bed, without his
                  better half being wiser therefor.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, Mrs. W—— awoke first. But what was her surprise and horror,
                  upon rising up, to see, instead of her lawful husband, what she thought a
                  strapping negro, as black as charcoal, lying at her side. Her first impulse was to
                  scream; but her presence of mind in this trying position, enabled her to keep
                  silence. You may be sure that she didn't remain long in such a close contact with
                  Sir Darkey. Not she! For, slipping out of bed quickly, but noiselessly, she glided
                  from the room, and was soon down stairs in the kitchen, where a stout, two-fisted
                  Irish girl was at work preparing breakfast.</p>
               <p>"Oh! dear! Kitty!" she exclaimed, panting for breath, and looking as pale as a
                  ghost, "have you seen any thing of Mr. W——, this morning?"</p>
               <p>"Och! no. But what ails ye? Ye're as white as a shate?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! mercy! Kitty. You wouldn't believe it, but there's a monstrous negro in my
                  room!"</p>
               <pb n="248-251" xml:id="VAC5627-00000126"/>
               <p>"Gracious me! Mrs. W——, a nager?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, Kitty!" returned Mrs. W——, trembling in every limb. "And worse and
                  worse, he's in my bed! I just 'woke up and thought it was Mr. W—— by my side But,
                  when I looked over, I saw instead of his face, one as black as the stove. Mercy on
                  me! I was frightened almost to death."</p>
               <p>"Is he aslape?" asked Kitty.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sound asleep and snoring. Oh! dear! What shall we do? Where in the world is
                  Mr. W——? I'm afraid this negro has murdered him."</p>
               <p>"Och! the blasted murtherin' thafe!" exclaimed Kitty, her organ of combativeness,
                  which was very large, becoming terribly excited. "Get into mistress's bed, and the
                  leddy there herself, the omadhoun! The black, murtherin' thafe of a villain!"</p>
               <p>And Kitty, thinking of no danger to herself, and making no calculation of
                  consequences, seized a stout hickory clothes pole that stood in one corner of the
                  kitchen, and went up stairs like a whirlwind, banging the pole against the door,
                  balusters, or whatever came in its way. The noise roused W—— from his sleep, and
                  he raised up in bed just as Kitty entered the room.</p>
               <p>"Oh! you murtherin' thafe of a villain!" shouted Kitty, as she caught sight of his
                  black face, pitching into him with her pole, and sweeping off his night-cap, at
                  the imminent risk of taking his head with it.</p>
               <p>"Hallo!" he cried, not at all liking this strange proceeding, "are you mad?"</p>
               <p>"Mad is it, ye thafe!" retorted Kitty, who did not recognize the voice, and taking
                  a surer aim this time with her pole, brought him a tremendous blow alongside of
                  the head, which knocked him senseless.</p>
               <p>Mrs. W—— who was at the bottom of the stairs, heard her husband's exclamation,
                  and, knowing his voice, came rushing up, and entered the room in time to see
                  Kitty's formidable weapon come with terrible force against his head. Before the
                  blow could be repeated, for Kitty, ejaculating her "murtherin' thafe of a
                  villain!" had lifted the pole again, Mrs. W—— threw her arms around her neck, and
                  cried, "Don't, don't, Kitty, for mercy's sake!" It's Mr. W——, and you've killed
                  him!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. W—— indade!" retorted Kitty, indignantly, struggling to free herself. "Is Mr.
                  W—— a thafe of a nager, ma'am?"</p>
               <p>But even Kitty's eyes, as soon as they took the pains to look more closely, saw
                  that it was indeed all as the mistress had said. W—— had fallen over on his face,
                  and his head and white neck were not to be mistaken.</p>
               <p>The pole dropped from Kitty's hands, and, with the exclamation, "Och! murther!"
                  she turned and shot from the room, with as good a will as she had entered it.</p>
               <p>The blow which W—— received was severe, breaking through the flesh and bruising
                  and lacerating his ear badly. He recovered very soon, however, and, as he arose
                  up, caught sight of himself in a looking glass that hung opposite. We may be sure
                  that it took all parties, in this exciting and almost tragical affair, some time
                  to understand exactly what was the matter. W——'s recollection of the loud
                  merriment that had driven him from the "Black Horse" on the previous night, when
                  it revived, as it did pretty soon, explained all to him, and set him to talking in
                  a most unchristian manner.</p>
               <p>Poor Kitty was so frightened at what she had done that she gathered up her "duds"
                  and fled instanter, and was never again seen in that neighborhood.</p>
               <p>As for W——, he was cured of his nocturnal visits to the "Black Horse," and his
                  love of whisky toddy. Some months afterwards he espoused the temperance cause, and
                  I've heard him tell the tale myself, many a time, and laugh heartily at the figure
                  he must have cut, when Kitty commenced beating him for a "thafe of a nager."</p>

               <head>THE BROKEN PLEDGE.</head>
               <p>"IT is two years, this very day, since I signed the pledge," remarked Jonas
                  Marshall, a reformed drinker, to his wife, beside whom he sat one pleasant summer
                  evening, enjoying the coolness and quiet of that calm hour.</p>
               <p>"Two years! And is it, indeed, so long?" was the reply. "How swiftly time passes,
                  when the heart is not oppressed with cape and sorrow!"</p>
               <p>"To me, they have been the happiest of my life," resumed the husband. "How much do
                  we owe to this blessed reformation!"</p>
               <p>"Blessed, indeed, may it be called!" the wife said, with feeling.</p>
               <p>"It seems scarcely possible, Jane, that one, who, like me, had become such a slave
                  to intoxication, could have been reclaimed. I often think of myself, and wonder. A
                  little over two years ago, I could no more control the intolerable desire for
                  liquor that I felt, than I could fly. Now I have not the least inclination to
                  touch, taste, or handle it."</p>
               <p>"And I pray Heaven you may never again have!"</p>
               <p>"That danger is past, Jane. Two years of total abstinence have completely changed
                  the morbid craving once felt for artificial stimulus, into a natural and healthy
                  desire for natural and healthy aliments."</p>
               <p>"It would be dangerous for you even now, Jonas, to suffer a drop of liquor to pass
                  your lips; do you not think so?"</p>
               <p>"There would be no particular danger in my tasting liquor, I presume. The danger
                  would be, as at first, in the use of it, until an appetite was formed." Marshall
                  replied, in a tone of confidence.</p>
               <p>"Then you think that old, inordinate craving for drink, has been entirely
                  eradicated?"</p>
               <p>"O yes, I am confident of it."</p>
               <p>"And heartily glad am I to hear you say so. It doubles the guarantee for our own
                  and children's happiness. The pledge to guard us on one side, and the total loss
                  of all desire on the other, is surely a safe protection. I feel, that into the
                  future I may now look, without a single painful anxiety on this account."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Jane. Into the future you may look with hope. And as to the past, let it
                  sink, with all its painful scenes,—its heart-aching trials, into oblivion."</p>
               <p>Jonas Marshall and his young wife had, many years before the period in which the
                  above conversation took place, entered upon the world with cheerful hopes, and a
                  flattering promise of happiness. They were young persons of cultivated tastes, and
                  had rather more of this world's goods than ordinarily falls to the lot of those
                  just commencing life. A few years sufficed to dash all their hopes to the ground,
                  and to fill the heart of the young wife with a sorrow that it seemed impossible
                  for her to bear. Marshall, from habitual drinking of intoxicating liquors, found
                  the taste for them fully confirmed before he dreamed of danger, and he had not the
                  strength of character at once and for ever to abandon their use. Gradually he went
                  down, down, slowly at first, but finally with a rapid movement, until he found
                  himself stripped of everything, and himself a confirmed drunkard. For nearly two
                  years longer, he surrendered himself up to drink—his wife and children suffering
                  more than my pen can describe, or any but the drunkard's wife and drunkard's
                  children realize.</p>
               <p>Then came a new era. A friend of humanity sought out the poor, degraded wretch, in
                  his misery and obscurity, and prevailed upon him to abandon his vile habits, and
                  pledge himself to total abstinence. Two years from the day that pledge was signed,
                  found him again rising in the world, with health, peace, and comfort, the cheerful
                  inmates of his dwelling. Here is the brief outline of a reformed drinker's
                  history. How many an imagination can fill in the dark shadows, and distinct,
                  mournful features of the gloomy picture!</p>
               <p>On the day succeeding the second anniversary of Jonas Marshall's reformation, he
                  was engaged to dine with a<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5627-00000128"/> few friends,
                  and met them at the appointed hour. With the dessert, wine was introduced. Among
                  the guests were one or two persons with whom Marshall had but recently become
                  acquainted. They knew little or nothing of his former life. One of them sat next
                  to him at table, and very naturally handed him the wine, with a request to drink
                  with him.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," was the courteous, but firm reply. "I do not drink wine."</p>
               <p>Another, who understood the reason of this refusal, observing it, remarked—</p>
               <p>"Our friend Marshall belongs to the tee-totallers."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed! Then we must, of course, excuse him," was the gentlemanly
                  response.</p>
               <p>"Don't you think, Marshall," remarked another, "that you temperance men are a
                  little too rigid in your entire proscription of wine?"</p>
               <p>"For the reformed drinker," was the reply, "it is thought to be the safest way to
                  cut off entirely everything that can, by possibility, inflame the appetite. Some
                  argue, that when that morbid craving, which the drunkard acquires, is once formed,
                  it never can be thoroughly eradicated."</p>
               <p>"Do you think the position a true one?" asked a member of the party.</p>
               <p>"I have my doubts of it," Marshall said. "For instance: Most of you know that for
                  some years I indulged to excess in drink. Two years ago I abandoned the use of
                  wine, brandy, and everything else of an intoxicating nature. For a time, I felt
                  the cravings of an intense desire for liquor; but my pledge of total abstinence
                  restrained me from any indulgence. Gradually, the influence of my old appetite
                  subsided, until it ceased to be felt. And it is now more than a year since I have
                  experienced the slightest inclination to touch a drop. Your wine and brandy are
                  now, gentlemen, no temptation to me."</p>
               <p>"But if that be the case," urged a friend, "why need you restrict yourself, so
                  rigidly, from joining in a social glass? Standing, as you evidently do, upon the
                  ground you occupied, before, by a too free indulgence, you passed, unfortunately,
                  the point of self-control: you may now enjoy the good things of life without
                  abusing them. Your former painful experience will guard you in that respect."</p>
               <p>"I am not free to do so," replied Marshall.</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because I have pledged myself never again to drink anything that can intoxicate,
                  and confirmed that pledge by my sign-manual—thus giving it a double force and
                  importance."</p>
               <p>"What end had you in view in making that pledge?"</p>
               <p>"The emancipation of myself from the horrible bondage in which I had been held for
                  years."</p>
               <p>"That end is accomplished."</p>
               <p>"True. But the obligations of my pledge are perpetual."</p>
               <p>"That is a mere figure of speech. You fully believed, I suppose, that perpetual
                  total-abstinence was absolutely necessary for your safety?"</p>
               <p>"I certainly did."</p>
               <p>"You do not believe so now?"</p>
               <p>"No. I have seen reason, I think, to change my views in that respect. The appetite
                  which I believed would remain throughout life, and need the force of a solemn bond
                  to restrain it, has, under the rigid discipline of two years, been destroyed. I
                  now feel myself as much above the enslaving effects of intoxicating liquors, as I
                  ever did in my life."</p>
               <p>"Then, it is clear to my mind, that all the obligations of your pledge are
                  fulfilled; and that, as a matter of course, it ceases to be binding."</p>
               <p>"I should be very unwilling to violate that pledge."</p>
               <p>"It would be, virtually, no violation."</p>
               <p>"I cannot see it in that light," Marshall said, although you may be perfectly
                  correct. At any rate, I am not now willing to act up to your interpretation of the
                  matter."</p>
               <p>This declaration closed the argument, as his friends did not feel any strong
                  desire to see him drink, and argued the matter with him as much for argument sake
                  as anything else. In this they acted with but little true wisdom; for the
                  particular form in which the subject was presented to the mind of Marshall, gave
                  him something to think about and reason about. And the more he thought and<pb
                     n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5627-00000129"/> reasoned, the more did he become
                  dissatisfied with the restrictions under which he found himself placed. Not having
                  felt, for many months, the least desire for liquor, he imagined that even the
                  latent inclination which existed, as he readily supposed, for some time, had
                  become altogether extinguished. There existed, therefore, in his estimation, now
                  that he had begun to think over the matter, no good reason why he should abstain,
                  totally, from wine, at least, on a social occasion.</p>
               <p>The daily recurrence of such thoughts, soon began to worry his mind, until the
                  pledge, that had for two years lain so lightly upon him, became a burden almost
                  too intolerable to be borne.</p>
               <p>"Why didn't I bind myself for a limited period?" he at last said, aloud, thus
                  giving a sanction and confirmation by word of the thoughts that had been gradually
                  forming themselves into a decision in his mind. No sooner had he said this, than
                  the whole subject assumed a more distinct form, and a more imposing aspect in his
                  view. He now saw clearly, what had not before seemed perfectly plain—what had been
                  till then encompassed by doubts. He was satisfied that he had acted blindly when
                  he pledged himself to total-abstinence.</p>
               <p>"Three hundred signed the pledge last night," said his wife to him, a few weeks
                  after the occurrence of the dinner-party, just mentioned.</p>
               <p>"Three hundred! We are carrying everything before us."</p>
               <p>"Who can tell," resumed the wife, "the amount of happiness involved in three
                  hundred pledges to total-abstinence? There were, doubtless, many husbands and
                  fathers among the number who signed. Now, there is joy in their dwellings. The
                  fire, that long since went out, is again kindled upon their hearths. How deeply do
                  I sympathize with the heart-stricken wives, upon whom day as again arisen, with a
                  bright sun shining down from an unclouded sky!"</p>
               <p>"It is, truly, to them, a new era—or the dawning of a new existence.—Most
                  earnestly do I wish that the day had arrived, which I am sure will come, when not
                  a single wife in the land will mourn over the wrong she suffers at the hand of a
                  drunken husband."</p>
               <p>"To that aspiration, I can utter a most devout amen," Mrs. Marshall rejoined,
                  fervently.</p>
               <p>"A few years of perseverance and well-directed energy, on our part, will effect
                  all this, I allow myself fondly to hope, if we do not create a reaction by
                  over-doing the matter."</p>
               <p>"How, over-doing it?" asked the wife.</p>
               <p>"There is a danger of over-doing it in many ways. And I am by no means sure that
                  the pledge of perpetual abstinence is not an instance of this."</p>
               <p>"The pledge of perpetual abstinence! Why, husband, what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"My remark seems to occasion surprise. But I think that I can make the truth of
                  what I say apparent to your mind. The use of the pledge, you will readily admit,
                  is to protect a man against the influence of a morbid thirst for liquor, which his
                  own resolution is not strong enough to conquer."</p>
               <p>"Well."</p>
               <p>"So soon, then, as this end is gained, the use of the pledge ceases."</p>
               <p>"Is it ever gained? Is a man who has once felt this morbid thirst, ever safe from
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly do I believe that he is. Most certainly do I believe that a few
                  years of total abstinence from everything that intoxicates, will place him on the
                  precise ground that he occupied before the first drop of liquor passed his
                  lips."</p>
               <p>"I cannot believe this, Jonas. Whatever is once confirmed by habit, it seems to
                  me, must be so incorporated into the mental and physical organization, as never to
                  be eradicated. Its effect is to change, in a degree, the whole system, and to
                  change it so thoroughly, as to give a bias to all succeeding states of mind and
                  body—thus transmitting a tendency to come under the influence of that bias."</p>
               <p>"You advance a thing, Jane, which will not hold good in practice. As, for
                  instance, it is now two years since I tasted a drop of wine, brandy, or anything
                  else of a like nature. If your theory were true, I should still feel a latent
                  desire, at times, to drink again. But this is not the case. I have not the
                  slightest inclination. The sight, or<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5627-00000130"/>
                  even the smell of wine, does not produce the old desire, which it would inevitably
                  do, if it were only quiescent—not extirpated—as I am confident that it is."</p>
               <p>"And this is the reason why you think the pledge should not be perpetual?"</p>
               <p>"It is. Why should there be an external restraint imposed upon a mere nonentity?
                  It is absurd!"</p>
               <p>"Granting, for the sake of argument, the view you take, in regard to the
                  extirpation of the morbid desire, which, however, I cannot see to be true," Mrs.
                  Marshall said, endeavouring to seem unconcerned, notwithstanding the position
                  assumed by her husband troubled her instinctively,—"it seems to me, that there
                  still exists a good reason why the pledge should be perpetual."</p>
               <p>"What is that, Jane?"</p>
               <p>"If a man has once been led off by a love of drink, when no previous habit had
                  been formed, there exists, at least, the same danger again, if liquor be used;—and
                  if it should possibly be true that the once formed desire, if subdued, is
                  latent—not eradicated—the danger is quadrupled."</p>
               <p>"I do not see the force of what you say," the husband replied. "To me, it seems,
                  that the very fact that he had once fallen, and the remembrance of its sad
                  consequences, would be a sure protection against another lapse from sobriety."</p>
               <p>"It may all be so," Mrs. Marshall said, in a voice that conveyed a slight evidence
                  of the sudden shadow that had fallen upon her heart. And then ensued a silence of
                  more than a minute. The wife then remarked in an inquiring tone—</p>
               <p>"Then, if I understand you rightly, you think that the pledge should be binding
                  only for a limited time?"</p>
               <p>"I do."</p>
               <p>"How long?"</p>
               <p>"From one to two years. Two, at the farthest, would be sufficient, I am fully
                  convinced, to restore any man, to the healthy tone of mind and body that he once
                  possessed. And then, the recollection of the past would be an all-sufficient
                  protection for the future."</p>
               <p>Seeing that the husband was confirming himself more and more in the dangerous
                  position that he had assumed, Mrs. Marshall said no more. Painfully conscious was
                  she, from a knowledge of his peculiar character, that, if the idea now floating in
                  his mind should become fixed by a rational confirmation, it would lead to evil
                  consequences. From that moment, she began eagerly to cast about in her mind for
                  the means of setting him right,—means that should fully operate, without her
                  apparent agency. But one way presented itself,—(argument, she was well aware, as
                  far as it was possible for her to enter into it with him, would only set his mind
                  the more earnestly in search of reason, to prove the correctness of his assumed
                  positions,)—and that was to induce him to attend more frequently the temperance
                  meetings, and listen to the addresses and experiences there given.</p>
               <p>"Come, dear," she said to him, after tea, a few evenings subsequent to the time
                  Marshall had begun to urge his objections to the pledge. "I want you to go with me
                  to-night to this great temperance meeting. Mr. —— is going to make an address, and
                  I wish to hear him very much."</p>
               <p>"It will be so crowded, Jane, that you will not have the least satisfaction,"
                  objected her husband—"and, besides, the evening is very warm."</p>
               <p>"But I don't mind that, Jonas. I am very anxious to hear Mr. —— speak."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, Jane," Marshall said, after the silence of a few moments. "But I
                  recollect, now, that I promised Mr. Patton to call down and see him this evening.
                  There are to be a few friends there, and he wished me, particularly, to meet
                  them."</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Marshall's countenance fell at this, and the tears gathered in her
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"So, then, you won't go with me to the temperance meeting," she said, in a
                  disappointed tone.</p>
               <p>"I should like to do so, Jane," was the prevaricating reply, "but you see that it
                  is out of my power, without breaking my promise, which you would not, of course,
                  have me do."</p>
               <p>"O, no, of course not."</p>
               <p>"You can go, Jane. I will leave you at the door, and call for you when the meeting
                  is out."</p>
               <p>"No, I do not feel like going, now I should have<pb n="260-261"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000131"/> enjoyed it with you by my side. But to go alone
                  would mar all the pleasure."</p>
               <p>"But surely that need not be, Jane. You know that I cannot be always with
                  you."</p>
               <p>"No, of course not," was uttered, mechanically; and then followed a long
                  silence.</p>
               <p>"So you will not go," Marshall at length said.</p>
               <p>"I should not enjoy the meeting, and therefore do not wish to go," his wife
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for it, but cannot help it now, for I should not feel right were I not
                  to comply with my promise."</p>
               <p>"I do not wish you to break it, of course. For a promise should ever be kept
                  sacred," Mrs. Marshall said, with a strong emphasis on the latter sentence.</p>
               <p>This emphasis did not escape the notice of her husband, who felt that it was
                  meant, as it really was, to apply to his state of mind in regard to the pledge.
                  For it was a fact, which the instinctive perception of his wife had detected, that
                  he had begun, seriously, to argue in his own mind, the question, whether, under
                  the circumstances of the case, seeing, that, in taking the pledge, the principle
                  of protection was alone considered, he was any longer bound by it. He did not,
                  however, give expression to the thoughts that he had at the time. The subject of
                  conversation was changed, and, in the course of half an hour, he left to fulfil
                  his engagement, which had not, in reality, been a positive one. As he closed the
                  door after him, Mrs. Marshall experienced a degree of loneliness, and a gloomy
                  depression of feeling, that she could not fully account for, though she could not
                  but acknowledge that, for a portion of it, there existed too certain a cause, in
                  the strange and dangerous position her husband had taken in regard to the
                  pledge.</p>
               <p>As Marshall emerged from his dwelling, and took his way towards the friend's
                  house, where he expected to meet a select company, his mind did not feel perfectly
                  at ease. He had partly deceived his wife in reference to the positive nature of
                  the engagement, and had done so in order to escape from an attendance on a
                  temperance meeting. This did not seem right. There was, also, a consciousness in
                  his mind that it would be extremely hazardous to throw off the restraints of his
                  pledge, at the same time that a resolution was already half formed to do so. The
                  agitation of mind occasioned by this conflict continued until he arrived at his
                  friend's door, and then, as he joined the pleasant company within, it all
                  subsided.</p>
               <p>"A hearty welcome, Marshall!" said the friend, grasping his hand and shaking it
                  warmly. "We were really afraid that we should not have the pleasure of your good
                  society. But right glad am I, that, with your adherence to temperance men and
                  temperance principles, you do not partake of the exclusive and unsocial character
                  that so many assume."</p>
               <p>"I regard my friends with the same warm feelings that I ever did," Marshall
                  replied,—"and love to meet them as frequently."</p>
               <p>"That is right. We are social beings, and should cultivate reciprocal
                  good-feelings. But don't you think, Marshall, that some of you temperance folks
                  carry matters too far?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do. As, for instance, I consider this binding of a man to perpetual
                  total-abstinence, as an unnecessary infringement of individual liberty. As I look
                  upon it, the use of the pledge, is to enable a man, by the power of an external
                  restraint, to gain the mastery over an appetite that has mastered him. When that
                  is accomplished, all that is wanted is obtained: of what use is the pledge after
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"Very true," was the encouraging reply.</p>
               <p>"A man," resumed Marshall, repeating the argument he had used to his wife, which
                  now seemed still more conclusive, "has only to abstain for a year or two from
                  liquor to have the morbid craving for it which over-indulgence had created,
                  entirely eradicated. Then he stands upon safe ground, and may take a social glass,
                  occasionally, with his friends, without the slightest danger. To bind himself up,
                  then, to perpetual abstinence, seems not only useless, but a real infringement of
                  individual liberty."</p>
               <p>"So it presents itself to my mind," rejoined one of the company.</p>
               <p>"I feel it to be so in my case," was the reply of the reformed man to this, thus
                  going on to invite temptation, instead of fleeing from it.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, if I were the individual concerned," remarked<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000132"/> marked one of the company, "I should not be long in
                  breaking away from such arbitrary restrictions."</p>
               <p>"How would you get over the fact of having signed the pledge?" asked Marshall,
                  with an interest that he dared not acknowledge to himself.</p>
               <p>"Easy enough," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"How?"</p>
               <p>"On the plea that I was deceived into signing such a pledge."</p>
               <p>"How deceived?"</p>
               <p>"Into a belief that it was the only remedy in my case. There is no moral law
                  binding any man to a contract entered into ignorantly. The fact of ignorance, in
                  regard to the fundamental principles of an agreement, vitiates it. Is not that
                  true?"</p>
               <p>"It certainly is," was the general reply to this question.</p>
               <p>"Then you think," said Marshall, after reflecting for a few moments, "that no
                  moral responsibility would attach to me, for instance, if I were to act
                  independently of my pledge?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly none could attach," was the general response; "provided, of course,
                  that the end of that pledge was fully attained."</p>
               <p>"Of that there can be no doubt," was the assumption of the reformed man. "The end
                  was, to save me from the influence of an appetite for drink, against which, in my
                  own strength, I could not contend. That end is now accomplished. Two years of
                  total abstinence has made me a new man. I now occupy the same ground that I
                  occupied before I lost my self-control."</p>
               <p>"Then I can see no reason why you should be denied the social privilege of a glass
                  with your friends," urged one of the company.</p>
               <p>"Nor can I see it clearly," Marshall said. "Still I feel that a solemn pledge,
                  made more solemn and binding by the subscription of my name, is not a thing to be
                  lightly broken. The thought of doing so troubles me, when I seriously reflect upon
                  it."</p>
               <p>"It seems to me that, were I in your place," gravely remarked one of the company,
                  heretofore silent, "I would not break my pledge without fully settling two
                  points—if it is possible for you, or any other man, under like circumstances, to
                  settle them."</p>
               <p>"What are they?" asked Marshall, with interest.</p>
               <p>"They are the two most prominent points in your case;—two that have already been
                  introduced here to-night. One involves the question, whether you are really free
                  from the influence of your former habits?"</p>
               <p>"I have not a single doubt in regard to that point," was the positive reply.</p>
               <p>"I do not see, Mr. Marshall, how it is possible for you to settle it beyond a
                  doubt," urged the friend. "To me, it is not philosophically true that the power of
                  habit is ever entirely destroyed. All subsequent states of body or mind, I fully
                  believe, are affected and modified by what has gone before, and never lose the
                  impression of preceding states,—and more particularly of anything like an
                  overmastering habit—or rather, I should say, in this case, of an overmastering
                  affection. The love, desire, or affection, whichever you may choose to call it,
                  which you once felt for intoxicating drinks, or for the effects produced by them,
                  never could have existed in the degree that they did, without leaving on your
                  mind—which is a something far more real and substantial than this material body,
                  which never loses the marks and scars of former abuse—ineradicable impressions.
                  The forms of old habits, if this be true, and that it so, <emph>I</emph> fully
                  believe, still remain; and these forms are in the endeavour, if I may so speak, to
                  be filled with the affections that once made them living and active. Rigidly
                  exclude everything that can excite these, and you are safe;—but, to me it seems,
                  that no experiment can be so dangerous, as one which will inevitably produce in
                  these forms a vital activity."</p>
               <p>"That, it seems to me," was the reply of one of the company, "is a little too
                  metaphysical—or rather, I should say, transcendental—for, certainly, it transcends
                  my powers of reasoning to be able to see how any permanent forms, as you call
                  them, can be produced in the mind, as in the body—the one being material, and the
                  other immaterial, and, therefore, no more susceptible of lasting impressions, than
                  the air around us."</p>
               <p>"You have not, I presume, given much thought to this subject," the previous
                  speaker said, "or you would not<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5627-00000133"/> doubt,
                  so fully, the truth of my remark. The power of habit, a fact of common observance,
                  which is nothing but a fixed form of the mind, illustrates it. And, certainly, if
                  the mind retained impressions no better than the air around us, we should remember
                  but little of what we learned in early years."</p>
               <p>"I see," was the reply to this, "that my remark was too broad. Still, the memory
                  of a thing is very different from a permanent and inordinate desire to do
                  something wrong, remaining as a latent principle in the mind, and ready to spring
                  into activity years afterwards, upon the slightest provocation."</p>
               <p>"It certainly is a different thing; and if it be really so, its establishment is a
                  matter of vital importance. In regard to reformed drinkers, there has been much
                  testimony in proof of the position. I have heard several men relate their
                  experiences; and all have said that time and again had they resolved to conquer
                  the habit that was leading them on headlong to destruction; and that they had, on
                  more than one occasion, abstained for months. But that, so soon as they again put
                  liquor to their lips, the old desire came back for it, stronger and more
                  uncontrollable than before."</p>
               <p>"That was, I presume," Marshall remarked, "because they had not abstained long
                  enough."</p>
               <p>"One man, I remember to have heard say, that he did not at one period of his life
                  use any kind of intoxicating drink for three years. He then ventured to take a
                  glass of cider, and was drunk and insensible before night! And what was worse, did
                  not again rise superior to his degradation for years."</p>
               <p>"I should call that an, extreme case," urged the infatuated man. "There must have
                  been with him a hereditary propensity. His father was, doubtless, a drunkard
                  before him."</p>
               <p>"As to that, I know nothing, and should not be willing to assume the fact as a
                  practical principle,"—the friend replied. "But there is another point that ought
                  to be fully settled."</p>
               <p>"What is that?"</p>
               <p>"No one can, without seriously injuring himself, morally, violate a solemn
                  pledge—particularly, as you have justly said, a pledge made more binding and
                  solemn, by act and deed, in the sign-manual. A man may verbally pledge himself to
                  do or not to do a thing. To violate this pledge deliberately, involves moral
                  consequences to himself that are such as almost any one would shrink from
                  incurring. But when a man gives to any pledge or contract a fulness and a
                  confirmation by the act of subscribing his name to it, and then deliberately
                  violates that pledge or contract, he necessarily separates himself still further
                  from the saving power of good principles and influences than in the other case,
                  and comes more fully under the power of evil principles and evil influences. After
                  such an act, that man's state is worse, far worse than it was before. I speak
                  strongly and earnestly on this subject, because I feel deeply its importance. And
                  I would say to our friend Marshall here, as I would say to my own brother, let
                  these two points be fully settled before you venture upon dangerous ground. Be
                  sure that the latent desire for stimulating drinks is fully eradicated—and be
                  certain that your pledge can be set aside without great moral injury to yourself,
                  before you take the first step towards its violation, which may be a step fraught
                  with the most fatal consequences to yourself and family."</p>
               <p>This unlooked-for and serious turn which the discussion assumed, had the effect to
                  make Marshall hesitate to do what he had too hastily made his mind up that he
                  might venture upon without the slightest danger. It also furnished reasons to the
                  company why they should not urge him to drink. The result was, that he escaped
                  through all the temptations of the evening, which would have overcome him,
                  inevitably, had his own inclination found a general voice of encouragement.</p>
               <p>But none of the strong arguments why he should not again run madly into the way of
                  evil, which had been so opportunely and unexpectedly urged, had the effect to keep
                  his eye off of the decanters and brim-full glasses that circulated far too
                  freely;—nor to prevent the sight of them from exciting in his mind a strong,
                  almost unconquerable desire, to join with the rest. This very desire ought to have
                  warned him—it should have caused him to tremble and flee away as if a raging wild
                  beast had stood in his path. But it did not. He deceived himself by assuming <pb
                     n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5627-00000134"/>
                  <choice>

                     <corr>that</corr>
                  </choice> the desire which he felt to drink with his friends arose from his love
                  of sociality, not of wine.</p>
               <p>The evening was lonely and long to Mrs. Marshall, and there was a shadow over her
                  feelings that she endeavoured in vain to dispel. Her husband's knock, which came
                  between ten and eleven o'clock, and for which she had been listening anxiously for
                  at least an hour, made her heart bound and tremble, producing a feeling of
                  weakness and oppression. As she opened the door for him, it was with a vague fear.
                  This was instantly dispelled by his first affectionate word uttered in steady
                  tones. He was still himself! Still as he had been for the blessed two years that
                  had just gone by!</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Jane? You look troubled," the husband remarked, after he had
                  seated himself, and observed his wife's appearance.</p>
               <p>"Do I?—If so, it is because I have felt troubled this evening."</p>
               <p>"Why were you troubled, Jane?"</p>
               <p>"That question I can hardly answer, either to your satisfaction or my own," Mrs.
                  Marshall said. "From some cause or other, my feelings have been strangely
                  depressed this evening; and I have experienced, besides, a consciousness of coming
                  misery, that has cast a shadow over my spirits, even now but half dispelled."</p>
               <p>"But why is all this, Jane? There must be some cause for such a change in your
                  feelings."</p>
               <p>"I know but one cause, dear husband!" Mrs. Marshall said, in a voice of deep
                  tenderness, laying her hand upon her husband's arm as she spoke, and looking him
                  in the face with an expression of earnest affection.</p>
               <p>"Speak out plainly, Jane. What is the cause?"</p>
               <p>"Do not be offended, Jonas, when I tell you, that I have not been so overcome by
                  such gloomy feelings since that happy day when you signed the pledge, as I have
                  been this evening. The cause of these feelings lies in the fact of your having
                  become dissatisfied with that pledge. I tremble, lest, in some unguarded moment,
                  under the assurance that old habits are conquered, you may be persuaded to cast
                  aside that impassable barrier, which has protected your home and little ones for
                  so long and happy a time."</p>
               <p>"You are weak and foolish, Jane," her husband said, in a half-offended tone.</p>
               <p>"In many things I know that I am," was Mrs. Marshall's reply, "but not in this. A
                  wife who loves her husband and children as tenderly as I do mine, cannot but
                  tremble when fears are suddenly awakened that the footsteps of a deadly enemy are
                  approaching her peaceful dwelling."</p>
               <p>"Such an enemy is not drawing nigh to your dwelling, Jane."</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant that it may not be so!" was the solemn ejaculation.</p>
               <p>"To this, Marshall felt no inclination to reply. He had already said enough in
                  regard to his pledge to awaken the fears of his wife, and to call forth from her
                  expressions of strong opposition to his views of the nature of his obligation. His
                  silence tended, in no degree, to quiet her troubled feelings.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, Marshall was thoughtful and silent. After breakfast, he went
                  out to attend to business, as usual. As he closed the door after him, his wife
                  heaved a deep sigh, lifted her eyes upwards, and prayed silently, but fervently,
                  that her husband might be kept from evil. And well might she thus pray, for he
                  needed support and sustenance in the conflict that was going on in his bosom—a
                  conflict far more vigorous than was dreamed of by the wife. He had invited
                  temptation, and now he was in the midst of a struggle, that would end in a more
                  perfect emancipation of himself from the demon-vice that had once ruled him with a
                  rod of iron, or in his being cast down to a lower depth of wretchedness and misery
                  than that out of which he had arisen. In this painful struggle he stood not alone.
                  Good spirits clustered around him, anxiously interested in his fate, and
                  endeavouring to sustain his faltering purposes; and evil spirits were also nigh,
                  infusing into his mind reasons for the abandonment of his useless pledge. It was a
                  period in his history full of painful interest. Heaven was moving forward to aid
                  and rescue him, and hell to claim another victim. But neither the one nor the
                  other could act upon him for good or for evil, except through his own volition. It
                  was for<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5627-00000135"/> him to turn himself to the one,
                  and live, or to the other, and die.</p>
               <p>So intense was this struggle, that, after he had entered his place of business, he
                  remained there for only a short time, unable to fix his mind upon anything out of
                  himself, or to bid the tempest in his mind "be still." Going out into the street,
                  he turned his steps he knew not whither. He had moved onwards but a few paces,
                  when the thought of home and his children came up in his mind, accompanied by a
                  strong desire to go back to his dwelling—a feeling that required a strong effort
                  to resist. The moment he had effectually resisted it, and resolved not to go home,
                  his eye fell upon the tempting exposure of liquors in a bar-room, near which he
                  happened to be passing. At the same instant, it seemed as if a strong hand were
                  upon him, urging him towards the open door.</p>
               <p>"No—no—no!" he said, half aloud, hurrying forward, "I am not prepared for that.
                  And yet, what a fool I am," he continued, "to suffer myself thus to be agitated!
                  Why not come to some decision, and end this uncertain, painful state at once? But
                  what shall I do? How shall I decide?"</p>
               <p>"To keep your pledge," a voice, half audible, seemed to say.</p>
               <p>"And be for ever restless under it,—for ever galled by its slavish chains,"
                  another voice urged, instantly.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he said, "that is the consequence which makes me hesitate. Fool—fool—not to
                  have taken a pledge for a limited period! I was deceived—tricked into an act that
                  my sober reason condemns! And should I now be held by that act? No!—no!—no! The
                  voice of reason says no! And I will not!"</p>
               <p>As he said this, he turned about, and walked with a firm, deliberate step, towards
                  the bar-room he had passed but a few moments before, entered it, called for a
                  glass of wine, and drank it off.</p>
               <p>"Now I am a free man!" he said, as he turned away, and proceeded towards his place
                  of business, with an erect bearing.</p>
               <p>He had not gone far, however, before he felt a strong desire for another glass of
                  wine, unaccompanied by any thought or fear of danger. From the moment he had
                  placed the forbidden draught to his lips, the struggle in his mind had ceased, and
                  a great calm succeeded to a wild conflict of opposite principles and influences.
                  He felt happy, and doubly assured that he had taken a right step. A second glass
                  of wine succeeded the first, and then a third, before he returned to his place of
                  business. These gave to the tone of his spirits a very perceptible elevation, but
                  threw over his mind a veil of confusion and obscurity, of which, however, he was
                  not conscious. An hour only had passed after his return to business, before he
                  again went out, and seeking an obscure drinking-house, where his entrance would
                  not probably be observed, he called for a glass of punch, and then retired into
                  one of the boxes, where it was handed to him. Its fragrance and flavour, as he
                  placed it to his lips, were delightful—so delightful, that it seemed to him a
                  concentration of all exquisite perceptions of the senses.</p>
               <p>Another was soon called for, and then another and another, each one stealing away
                  more and more of distinct consciousness, until at last he sunk forward on the
                  table before which he had seated himself, perfectly lost to all consciousness of
                  external things!</p>
               <p>Gladly would the writer draw a veil over all that followed that insane violation
                  of a solemn pledge, sealed as it had been by the hand-writing of confirmation. But
                  he cannot do it. The truth, and the whole truth needs to be told,—the beacon-light
                  must be raised on the gloomy shores of destruction, as a warning to the
                  thoughtless or careless navigator.</p>
               <p>Sadder and more wretched was the heart of Mrs. Marshall during the morning of that
                  day, than it had been on the evening before. There was an overwhelming sense of
                  impending danger in her mind, that she could not dissipate by any mode of
                  reasoning with herself. As her children came about her, she would look upon them
                  with an emotion of yearning tenderness, while her eyes grew dim with tears. And
                  then she would look up, and breathe a heart-felt prayer that He who tempereth the
                  winds to the shorn lamb, would regard her little ones.</p>
               <p>The failure of her husband to return at the dinner hour, filled her with trembling
                  anxiety. Not once during two years had he been absent from home without her
                     being<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5627-00000136"/> perfectly aware of the cause.
                  Its occurrence just at this crisis was a confirmation of her vague fears, and made
                  her sick at heart. Slowly did the afternoon pass away, and at last the hour came
                  for his return in the evening. But though she looked for his approaching form, and
                  listened for the well-known sound of his footsteps, he did not come.</p>
               <p>Anxiety and trembling uncertainty now gave way to an overwhelming alarm. Hurriedly
                  were her children put to bed, and then she went out to seek for him, she knew not
                  whither. To the store in which he had become a partner, she first turned her
                  steps. It was closed as she had feared. Pausing for a few moments to determine
                  where next to proceed, she concluded to go to the house of his partner, and learn
                  from him if he had been to the store that day, and at what time. On her way to his
                  dwelling, she passed down a small street, in which were several drinking-houses,
                  hid away there to catch the many who are not willing to be seen entering a
                  tavern.</p>
               <p>In approaching one of these, loud voices within, and the sound of a scuffle,
                  alarmed her. She was about springing forward to run, when the door was suddenly
                  thrown open, and a man dashed out, who fell with a violent concussion upon the
                  pavement, close by her feet. Something about his appearance, dark as it was,
                  attracted her eye. She stooped down, and laid her hand upon him. It was her
                  husband!</p>
               <p>A wild scream, that rung upon the air,—a scream which the poor heart-stricken
                  creature could not have controlled if her life had been the forfeit—brought
                  instant assistance. Marshall was taken into a neighbouring house, and a physician
                  called, who, on making an examination, said that a serious injury might, or might
                  not have taken place—he could not tell. One thing, however, was certain, the man
                  was beastly drunk.</p>
               <p>O, with what a chill did that last sentence fall upon the ear of his wife! It was
                  the death-knell to all the fond hopes she had cherished for two peaceful years.
                  For a moment she leaned her head against the wall near which she was standing, and
                  wished that she could die. But thoughts of her children, and thoughts of duty
                  roused her.</p>
               <p>A carnage was procured and her husband conveyed home, and then, after he had been
                  laid upon a bed, she was left alone with him, and her own sad reflections. It was,
                  to her, a sleepless night—but full of waking dreams, whose images of fear made her
                  heart tremble and shrink, and long for the morning.</p>
               <p>Morning at last came. How eagerly did the poor wife bend over the still
                  unconscious form of her husband, reading each line of his features, as the pale
                  light that came in at the windows gave distinctness to every object! He still
                  breathed heavily, and there was an expression of pain on his countenance. A double
                  cause for anxiety and alarm, pressed upon the heart of Mrs. Marshall. She knew not
                  how serious an injury his fall might have occasioned,—nor how utter might be his
                  abandonment of himself, now that he had broken his solemn pledge. As she bent over
                  him in doubt, pain, and anxiety, he suddenly awoke, and, without moving, looked
                  her for a moment steadily in the face, with a glance of earnest inquiry. Then came
                  a distinct recollection of his violated pledge; but all after that was only dimly
                  seen, or involved in wild confusion. His bodily sensations told him but too
                  plainly how deep had been his fall: and the intolerable desire, that seemed as if
                  it were consuming his very vitals, was to him a sad evidence that he had fallen,
                  never, he feared, to rise again. All this passed through his mind in a moment, and
                  he closed his eyes, and turned his face away from the earnest, and now tearful
                  gaze of his wife.</p>
               <p>"How do you feel, Jonas?" Mrs. Marshall inquired, tenderly, modifying her tones,
                  so as not to permit them to convey to his ear the exquisite pain that she felt.
                  But he made no reply.</p>
               <p>"Say, dear, how do you feel?" she urged, laying her hand upon him, and pausing for
                  an answer.</p>
               <p>"As if I were in hell!" he shouted, springing suddenly from the bed, and beginning
                  to dress himself, hurriedly.</p>
               <p>"O, husband, do not speak so!" Mrs. Marshall said, in a soothing tone. "All may be
                  well again. One sin need not bring utter condemnation. Let this be the last, as it
                  has been the first, violation of your pledge. Let this warn you against the
                  removal of that salutary restraint, which has been as a wall of fire around you
                  for years."</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5627-00000137"/>
               <p>"Jane!" responded the irritated man, pausing, and looking at his wife, fixedly,
                  while there sat upon his face an expression of terrible despair; "that pledge can
                  never be renewed! It would be like binding a giant with a spider's web. I am lost!
                  lost! lost! The eager, inexpressible desire that now burns within me, cannot be
                  controlled. The effort to do so would drive me mad. I must drink, or die. And you,
                  my poor wife!—and you, my children! what will become of you? Who will give you
                  sufficient strength to bear your dreadful lot?"</p>
               <p>As he said this, his voice fell to a low and mournful, despairing expression—and
                  he sunk into a chair, covering his face with his hands.</p>
               <p>"Dear husband!" urged his wife, coming to his side, and drawing her arm around his
                  neck, "do not thus give way! Let the love I have ever borne you, and which is
                  stronger and more tender at this moment than it has ever been—let the love you
                  feel for your dear little ones, give you strength to conquer. Be a man! Nerve
                  yourself, and look upwards for strength, and you must conquer."</p>
               <p>"No—no—no—Jane!" the poor wretch murmured, shaking his head, mournfully. "Do not
                  deceive your heart by false hopes, for they will all be in vain. I cannot look up.
                  The heavens have become as brass to me. I have forfeited all claim to success from
                  above. As I lifted the fatal glass to my lips, I heard a voice, whose tones were
                  as distinct as yours—'Let us go hence!' and from that moment, I have been weak and
                  unsustained in the hands of my enemies. I am a doomed man!"</p>
               <p>As he said this, a shrinking shudder passed through his frame, and he groaned
                  aloud. The silence that then reigned through the chamber was as appalling as the
                  silence of death to the heart of Mrs. Marshall. It was broken at length by her
                  husband, who looked up with an expression of tenderness in her face, as she still
                  stood with her hand upon him, and said—</p>
               <p>"Jane, my dear wife! let me say to you now, while I possess my full senses, which
                  I know not that I ever shall again, that you have been true and kind to me, and
                  that I have ever loved you with an earnest love. Bear with me in my infirmity;—if,
                  amid the grief, and wrong, and suffering, which must fall upon you and your
                  children, you <emph>can</emph> bear with the miserable cause of all your
                  wretchedness. I shall not long remain, I feel, to be a burden and a curse to you.
                  My downward course will be rapid, and its termination will soon come!"</p>
               <p>A gush of tears followed this, and then came a stern silence, that chilled the
                  heart of Mrs. Marshall. She longed to urge still further upon her husband to make
                  an effort to restrain the intense desire he felt, but could not. There seemed to
                  be a seal upon her lips. Slowly she turned away to attend to her little ones, upon
                  whom she now looked with something of that hopelessness which the widow feels, as
                  she turns from the grave of her husband, and looks upon her fatherless
                  children.</p>
               <p>With a strong effort, Marshall remained in the house until breakfast was on the
                  table. But he could only sip a little coffee, and soon arose, and lifted his hat
                  to go out. His wife was by his side, as he laid his hand on the door.</p>
               <p>"Jonas," she said, while the tears sprang to her eyes, "remember me—remember your
                  children!" She could say no more; sobs choked her utterance—and she leaned her
                  head, weak and desponding, upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Her husband made no reply, but gently placed her in a chair, kissed her cheek, and
                  then turned hastily away, and left the house.</p>
               <p>It was many minutes before Mrs. Marshall found strength to rise, and then she
                  staggered across the room, like one who had been stunned by a blow. We will not
                  attempt the vain task of describing her feelings through that terrible day;—of
                  picturing the alternate states of hope and deep despondency, that now made her
                  heart bound with a lighter emotion,—and now caused it to sink low, and almost
                  pulseless, in her bosom. It passed away at last, and brought the gloomy
                  night—fall—but not her husband's return. Eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve
                  o'clock came, and went, and still he was absent.</p>
               <p>For an hour she had been seated by the window, listening for the sound of his
                  approaching footsteps. As the clock struck twelve, she started, listened for a
                  moment still more intently, and then arose with a deep sigh, her manner indicating
                  a state of irresolution. First she went softly to the bed, and stood looking down
                  for some moments upon the faces of her little ones, sleeping calmly<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000138"/> and sweetly, all unconscious of the anguish that
                  swelled their mother's heart almost to bursting. Then she raised her head, and
                  again assumed a listening attitude. An involuntary sigh told that she had listened
                  in vain. A few moments after she was aroused from a state of deep abstraction of
                  thought, by a strong shudder passing through her frame, occasioned by some fearful
                  picture which her excited imagination had conjured up. She now went hastily to a
                  wardrobe, and took out her bonnet and shawl. One more glance at her children, told
                  her that they were sleeping soundly. In the next minute she was in the street,
                  bending her steps she knew not whither, in search of her husband.</p>
               <p>Almost involuntarily, Mrs. Marshall took her way towards that portion of the city
                  where she had, on the night previous, unexpectedly found him. It was not longer
                  before she paused by the door at the same drinking-house from which her husband
                  had been thrust, when he fell, almost lifeless, at her feet. Although it was past
                  twelve o'clock, the sound of many voices came from within, mingled with wild
                  excitement, and boisterous mirth.</p>
               <p>Now came a severe trial for her shrinking, sensitive feelings. How could she, a
                  woman, and alone, enter such a place, at such an hour, on such an errand? The
                  thought caused a sensation of faintness to pass over her, and she leaned for a
                  moment against the side of the door to keep from falling. But affection and
                  thoughts of duty quickly aroused her, and resolutely keeping down every weakness,
                  she placed her hand upon the door, which yielded readily to even her light hand,
                  and in the next moment found herself in the presence of about a dozen men, all
                  more or less intoxicated. Their loud, insane mirth was instantly checked by her
                  entrance. They were all men who were in the habit of mingling daily in good
                  society, and more than one of them knew Marshall, and instantly recognised his
                  wife. No rudeness was, of course, offered her. On the contrary, two or three came
                  forward, and kindly inquired, though they guessed too well, her errand there at
                  such an hour.</p>
               <p>"Has my husband been here to-night, Mr. ——?" she asked, in a choking voice, of one
                  whose countenance she instantly recognised.</p>
               <p>"I have not met with him, Mrs. Marshall," was the reply, in a kind, sympathizing
                  tone, "but I will inquire if any one here has seen him."</p>
               <p>These inquiries were made, and then Mr. —— came forward again, and said, in a low
                  tone,</p>
               <p>"Come with me, Mrs. Marshall."</p>
               <p>As the two emerged into the street, Mr. —— said,</p>
               <p>"I would not, if I were you, madam, attempt to look further for your husband. I
                  have just learned that he is safe and well, only a little overcome, by having,
                  accidentally, I have no doubt, drunken a little too freely. In the, morning he
                  will come home, and all will, I trust, be right again."</p>
               <p>"What you say, I know, is meant in kindness, Mr. ——," Mrs. Marshall replied, in a
                  firmer tone, the assurance that her husband was at least safe from external
                  danger, being some relief to her, "but I would rather see my husband, and have him
                  taken home. Home is the best place for him, under any circumstances—and I am the
                  most fitting one to attend to him. Will you, then, do me the favour to procure a
                  hack, and go with me to the place where he is to be found?"</p>
               <p>Mr. —— saw that in the manner and tone of Mrs. Marshall which made him at once
                  resolve to do as she wished him. The hack was procured, into which both entered.
                  Directions were given, in a low tone, to the driver, and then they rattled away
                  over the resounding pavement, for a space of time that seemed very long to the
                  anxious wife. At last the hack stopped, the door was opened, and the steps thrown
                  down. When Mrs. Marshall descended, she found herself in a narrow, dark street,
                  before a low, dirty-looking tavern, the windows and doors of which had been closed
                  for the night.</p>
               <p>While Mr. —— was knocking loudly for admission, her eyes, growing familiar with
                  the darkness, saw something lying partly upon the street and partly upon the
                  pavement a few yards from her, that grew more and more distinct, the more intently
                  she looked at it. Advancing a few steps, she saw that it was the body of a man,—a
                  few paces further, revealed to her eyes the form of her husband. An exclamation of
                  surprise and alarm brought both Mr. —— and the hack-driver to her side.</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5627-00000139"/>
               <p>In attempting to raise Marshall to his feet, he groaned heavily, and writhed with
                  a sensation of pain. Something dark upon the pavement attracted the eye of his
                  wife. She touched it with her hand, to which it adhered, with a moist, oily
                  feeling. Hurrying to the lamp in front of the hack, with a feeling of sudden
                  alarm, she lifted her hand so that the light could fall upon it. It was covered
                  with blood!</p>
               <p>With a strong effort, she kept down the sudden impulse that she felt to utter a
                  wild scream, and went back to Mr. —— and communicated to him the alarming fact she
                  had discovered. Marshall was at once laid gently down upon the pavement, and a
                  light procured, which showed that his pantaloons, above, below, and around the
                  knees, were saturated with blood.</p>
               <p>"O, Mr. ——! what can be the matter?" Mrs. Marshall said, in husky tones, looking
                  up, with a face blanched to an ashy paleness.</p>
               <p>"Some passing vehicle has, no doubt, run over him—but I trust that he is not much
                  hurt. Remain here with him, until I can procure assistance, and have him taken
                  home."</p>
               <p>"O, sir, go quickly!" the poor wife replied, in earnest tones.</p>
               <p>In a short time, four men, with a litter, were procured, upon which Marshall, now
                  groaning, as if acutely conscious of pain, was placed, and slowly conveyed home. A
                  surgeon reached the house as soon as the party accompanying the injured man. An
                  examination showed that his legs had been broken just above the knees. And one of
                  them had the flesh dreadfully torn and bruised, and both were crushed as if run
                  over by some heavy vehicle. A still further examination showed the fracture to be
                  compound, and extensive; but, fortunately, the knee joint had entirely escaped.
                  Already the limbs had swollen very considerably, exhibiting a rapidly increasing
                  inflammation. This was a natural result flowing from the large quantity of alcohol
                  which he had evidently been taking through the day and evening.</p>
               <p>Fortunately, notwithstanding the morbid condition of his body, and the nature and
                  extent of the injury he had sustained, the vital system of Marshall, unexhausted
                  by a long-continued series of physical abuse from drinking, rallied strongly
                  against the violent inflammation that followed the setting of the bones, and
                  dressing of the wounds, and threw off the too apparent tendency to mortification
                  that continued, much to the anxiety of the surgeon, for many days. During this
                  time, he suffered almost incessant pain—frequently of an excruciating character.
                  The severity of this pain entirely destroyed all desire for intoxicating drink.
                  This desire, however, gradually began to return, as the pain, which accompanied
                  the knitting of the bones, subsided. But he did not venture to ask for it, and, of
                  course, it was not offered to him.</p>
               <p>With the most earnest attentions, and the tenderest solicitude, did Mrs. Marshall
                  wait and watch by the bedside of her husband, both day and night, wearing down her
                  own strength, and neglecting her children.</p>
               <p>At the end of three weeks, he had so far recovered, as to be able to sit up, and
                  to bear a portion of his weight. As fear for the consequences of the injury her
                  husband had received, began to fade from the mind of Mrs. Marshall, another fear
                  took possession of it—a heart-sickening fear, under which her spirit grew faint.
                  There was no pledge to bind him, and his newly-awakened desire for liquor, she
                  felt sure would bear him away inevitably, notwithstanding the dreadful lesson he
                  had received.</p>
               <p>About this time, however, two or three of his temperance friends, who had heard of
                  his fall, came to see him. This encouraged her, especially as they soon began to
                  urge him again to sign the pledge;—but he would not consent.</p>
               <p>"It is useless," was his steady reply, to all importunities, and made usually, in
                  a mournful tone, "for me to sign another pledge. Having broken one, wilfully and
                  deliberately, I have no power to keep another. I am conscious of this—and,
                  therefore, am resolved not to stain my soul with another sin."</p>
               <p>"But you can keep it. I am sure you can," one friend, more importunate than the
                  rest, would repeatedly urge. "You broke your first pledge, deliberately, because
                  you believed that you were freed from the old desire, even in a latent form.
                  Satisfied, from painful experience, that this<pb n="278-279"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000140"/> is not the case, you will not again try so
                  dangerous an experiment."</p>
               <p>But Marshall would shake his head, sadly, in rejection of all arguments and
                  persuasions.</p>
               <p>"It may all seem easy enough for you," he would sometimes say, "who have never
                  broken a solemn pledge; but you know not how utter a destruction of internal moral
                  power such an act, deliberately done, effects. I am not the man I was, before I so
                  wickedly violated that solemn compact made between myself and heaven—for so I now
                  look upon it. While I kept my pledge, I had the sustaining power of heaven to bear
                  me safely up against all temptations;—but since the very moment it was broken, I
                  have had nothing but my own strength to lean upon, and that has proved to be no
                  better than a broken reed, piercing me through with many sorrows."</p>
               <p>To such declarations, in answer to arguments, and sometimes earnest entreaties
                  made by his friends to induce him to renew his pledge, Mrs. Marshall would listen
                  in silence, but with a sinking, sickening sensation of mind and body. All and more
                  than she could say, was said to him, but he resisted every appeal—and what good
                  could her weak persuasions and feeble admonitions do?</p>
               <p>Day after day passed on, and Marshall gradually gained more use of his limbs. In
                  six weeks, he could walk without the aid of his crutches.</p>
               <p>"I think I must try and get down to the store to-morrow," he said, to his wife,
                  about this time. "This is a busy season, and I can be of some use there for two or
                  three hours, every day."</p>
               <p>"I don't think I would venture out yet," Mrs. Marshall said, looking at him, with
                  an anxious, troubled expression of countenance, that she tried in vain to
                  conceal.</p>
               <p>"Why not, Jane?"</p>
               <p>"I don't think you are strong enough, dear."</p>
               <p>"O, yes, I am. And, besides, it will do me good to go out and take the fresh air.
                  You know that it is now six weeks since I have been outside of the front
                  door."</p>
               <p>"I know it has. But—"</p>
               <p>"But what, Jane?"</p>
               <p>"You know what I would say, Jonas. You know the terrible fear that rests upon my
                  heart like a night-mare."</p>
               <p>And Mrs. Marshall covered her face with her hands, and gave way to tears.</p>
               <p>A long silence followed this. At length Marshall said,</p>
               <p>"I hope, Jane, that I shall be able to restrain myself. I am, at least, resolved
                  to try."</p>
               <p>"O, husband, if you will only try!" Mrs. Marshall ejaculated eagerly, lifting her
                  tearful eyes, and looking him with an appealing expression in the face—"If you
                  will only try!"</p>
               <p>"I will try, Jane. But do not feel too much confidence in my effort. I am weak—so
                  weak that I tremble when I think of it—and remember what an almost irresistible
                  influence I have to contend with."</p>
               <p>"Why not take the pledge, again, Jonas?" said his wife, for the first time she had
                  urged that recourse upon him.</p>
               <p>"You have heard my reasons given for that, over and over again."</p>
               <p>"I know I have. But they never satisfied me."</p>
               <p>"You would not have me add the sin of a double violation of a solemn pledge to my
                  already overburdened conscience?"</p>
               <p>"No, Jonas. Heaven forbid!"</p>
               <p>"The fear of that restrains me. I dare not again take it."</p>
               <p>"Do you not deeply repent of your first violation?" the wife asked, after a few
                  moments of earnest thought. "Heaven knows how deeply."</p>
               <p>"And Heaven, that perceives and knows the depth and sincerity of that repentance,
                  accepts it according to its quality. And just so far as Heaven accepts the sincere
                  offering of a repentant heart, conscious of its own weakness, and mourning over
                  its derelictions, is strength given for combat in future temptations. The bruised
                  reed he will not break, nor quench the smoking flax. Hope, then, dear husband! you
                  are not cast off—you are not rejected by Heaven."</p>
               <p>"O, Jane, if I could feel the truth of what you. say, how happy I should be!—For
                  the idea of sinking again into that hopeless, abandoned, wretched condition, out
                  of which this severe affliction has lifted me, as by the hair<pb
                     n="280 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5627-00000141"/> of the head, is appalling!"
                  was the reply, to his wife's earnest appeal.</p>
               <p>"Trust me, dear husband,—there is truth in what I say. He who came down to man's
                  lowest, and almost lost condition, that he might raise him up, and sustain him
                  against the assaults of his worst enemies, has felt in his own body all the
                  temptations that ever can assail his children, and not only felt them, but
                  successfully resisted and conquered them; so that, there is no state, however low,
                  in which there is an earnest desire to rise out of evil, to which he does not
                  again come down, and in which he does not again successfully contend with the
                  powers of darkness. Look to Him, then, again, in a fixed resolution to put away
                  the evils into which you have fallen, and you must, you will be sustained!"</p>
               <p>"O, if I could but believe this, how eagerly would I again fly to the pledge!"
                  Marshall said, in an earnest voice.</p>
               <p>"Fly to it then, Jonas, as to a city of refuge; for it is true. You have felt the
                  power of the pledge once-try it again. It will be strength to you in your
                  weakness, as it has been before."</p>
               <p>Still Marshall hesitated. While he did so, his wife brought him pens, ink and
                  paper.</p>
               <p>"Write a pledge and sign it, dear husband!" she urged, as she placed them before
                  him. "Think of me—of the joy that it will bring to my heart—and sign."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, Jane."</p>
               <p>"Can you stand alone?"</p>
               <p>"I fear not."</p>
               <p>"Are you not sure, that the pledge will restrain you some?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes. If I ever take it again, I shall tremble under the fearful responsibility
                  that rests upon me."</p>
               <p>"Come with me, a moment," Mrs. Marshall said, after a thoughtful pause.</p>
               <p>Her husband followed, as she led the way to an adjoining room, where two or three
                  bright-eyed children were playing in the happiest mood.</p>
               <p>"For their sakes, if not for mine, Jonas, sign the pledge again," she said, while
                  her voice trembled, and then became choked, as she leaned her head upon his
                  shoulder.</p>
               <p>

               <pb n="-281" xml:id="VAC5627-00000142"/>
               <p>"You have conquered! I will sign!" he whispered in her ear.</p>
               <p>Eagerly she lifted her head, arid looked into his face with a glance of wild
                  delight.</p>
               <p>"O, how happy this poor heart will again be!" she ejaculated, clasping her hands
                  together, and looking upwards with a joyous smile.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes, a pledge of total abstinence from all kinds of intoxicating
                  drinks, was written out and signed. While her husband was engaged in doing this,
                  Mrs. Marshall stood looking down upon each letter as it was formed by his pen,
                  eager to see his name subscribed. When that was finally done; she leaned forward
                  on the table at which he wrote, swayed to and fro for a moment or two, and then
                  sank down upon the floor, lost to all consciousness of external things.</p>
               <p>From that hour to this, Jonas Marshall has been as true to his second pledge, even
                  in thought, as the needle to the pole. So dreadful seems the idea of its
                  violation, that the bare recollection of his former dereliction, makes him
                  tremble.</p>
               <p>"It was a severe remedy," he says, sometimes, in regard to his broken legs; "and
                  proved eminently successful. But for that, I should have been utterly lost."</p>

               <head>THE WANDERER'S RETURN.</head>
               <head type="sub">A THANKSGIVING STORY.</head>
               <p>A MAN, who at first sight, a casual observer would have thought at least forty or
                  fifty years of age, came creeping out of an old, miserable-looking tenement in the
                  lower part of Cincinnati, a little while after night-fall, and, with bent body and
                  shuffling gait, crossed the street an angle; and, after pausing for a few moments
                  before a mean frame building, in the windows of which decanters of liquor were
                  temptingly displayed, pushed open the door and entered.</p>
               <p>It was early in November. Already the leaves had fallen, and there was, in the
                  aspect of nature, a desolateness that mirrored itself in the feelings. Night had
                  come, hiding all this, yet by no means obliterating the impression which had been
                  made, but measurably increasing it; for, with the darkness had begun to fall a
                  misty rain, and the rising wind moaned sadly among the eaves.</p>
               <p>A short time after sundown the man, to whom we have just referred, came home to
                  the comfortless-looking house we have seen him leaving. All day he had turned a
                  wheel in a small manufactory; and when his work was done, he left, what to him was
                  a prison-house, and retired to the cheap but wretched boarding-place he had
                  chosen, where were congregated about a dozen men of the lowest class. He did not
                  feel happy. That was impossible. No one who debases himself by intemperance can be
                  happy; and this man had gone down, step by step, until he attained a depth of
                  degradation most sad to contemplate. And yet he was not thirty years old! After
                  supper he went out, as usual, to spend the evening in drinking.</p>
               <p>The man, fallen as he was, and lost to all the higher and nobler sentiments of the
                  heart, had experienced during the day a pressure upon his feelings heavier than
                  usual, that had its origin in some reviving memories of earlier times. The sound
                  of his mother's voice had been in his ears frequently through the day; and images
                  of persons, places, and scenes, the remembrance of which brought no joy to his
                  heart, had many times come up before him. At the supper-table, amid his coarse,
                  vulgar-minded companions, his laugh was not heard as usual; and, when spoken to,
                  he answered briefly and in monosyllables.</p>
               <p>The tippling-house to which the man went to spend his day's earnings and debase
                  himself with drink, was one of the lowest haunts of vice in the city. Gambling
                  with cards, dominoes, and dice, occupied the time of the greater number who made
                  it a place of resort, and little was heard there except language the most obscene
                  and profane. For his daily task at the wheel, the man was paid seventy-five cents
                  a day. His boarding and lodging cost him thirty-one and a quarter cents,—and this
                  had to be paid every night under penalty of being expelled from the house. He was
                  a degraded drunkard, and not therefore worthy of confidence nor credit beyond a
                  single day, and he received none. What remained of the pittance earned, was
                  invariably spent in drink, or gambled away before he retired from the grogshop for
                  the night; when, staggering home, he groped his way to his room, too helpless to
                  remove his clothes, and threw himself upon a straw pallet, that could scarcely be
                  dignified with the name of bed. This in outline, was the daily history of the
                  man's life; and daily the shadows of vice fell more and more darkly upon his
                  path.</p>
               <p>The drinking-house had two rooms on the first floor. In front was a narrow
                  counter, six or eight feet in length, and behind this stood a short, bloated,
                  vice-disfigured image of humanity, ready to supply the wants of customers. Two or
                  three roughly-made pine tables, and some chairs, stood around the room. The back
                  apartment contained simply chairs and tables, and was generally occupied by
                  parties engaged in games of chance, for small sums. Tobacco-smoke, the fumes of
                  liquor, and the polluted breaths of the inmates, made the atmosphere of these
                  rooms so offensive,. that none but those who had become accustomed to inhale it,
                  could have endured to remain there for a minute.</p>
               <p>The man, on entering this den of vice, went to the counter and called for whisky.
                  A decanter was set before him, and from this he poured into a glass nearly a gill
                     of<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5627-00000144"/> the vilest kind of stuff and
                  drank it off, undiluted. About half the quantity of water was sent down after the
                  burning fluid, to partially subdue its ardent qualities; and then the man turned
                  slowly from the bar. As he did so, an individual who had seen him enter, and who
                  had kept his eyes upon him from the moment he passed through the door, came
                  towards him with a smile of pleasure upon his countenance, and reaching out his
                  hand, said, in an animated voice—</p>
               <p>"How are you, Martin, my good fellow! How are you?"</p>
               <p>And he grasped the poor wretch's hand with a hearty grip and shook it warmly.
                  Something like a smile lighted up the marred and almost expressionless face of the
                  miserable creature, as he gave to the hand that had taken his a responsive
                  pressure, and replied,</p>
               <p>"Oh! very well, very well, considering all things."</p>
               <p>"Bad night out," said the man, as he sat down near a stove, that was sending forth
                  a genial heat.</p>
               <p>"Yes, bad enough," returned Martin. A thought of the damp and chilly air without
                  caused him to shiver suddenly, and draw a little nearer to the stove.</p>
               <p>"Which makes us prize a comfortable place like this, where we can spend a pleasant
                  evening among pleasant friends, so much the more."</p>
               <p>"Yes. It's very pleasant," said Martin, spreading himself out before the stove,
                  with a hand upon each knee, and looking with an absent-minded air, through the
                  opening in the door, which had once been closed by a thin plate of mica, and
                  seeing strange forms in the glowing coals.</p>
               <p>"Pleasant after a hard day's work," remarked the man, with an insinuating air.</p>
               <p>"I don't know what life would be worth, if seasons of recreation and social
                  intercourse did not come, nightly, to relieve both body and mind from their
                  wearisomeness and exhaustion."</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes. It's tiresome enough to have to sit and turn a wheel all day," said
                  Martin.</p>
               <p>"And a relief to get into a place like this at night," returned the man, rubbing
                  his hands with animation.</p>
               <p>"It's a great deal better than sitting at the wheel," sighed Martin.</p>
               <p>"I should think it was! Come! won't you liquor."</p>
               <p>"Thank you! I've just taken something."</p>
               <p>"No matter. Come along, my good fellow, and try something more." And he arose, as
                  he spoke, and moved towards the bar.</p>
               <p>Martin was not the man to refuse a drink at any time, so he followed to the
                  counter.</p>
               <p>"What'll you take? Whisky, rum, gin, brandy, or spirits? Any thing, so it's strong
                  enough to drink to old acquaintanceship. Ha! my boy?" And he leered in Martin's
                  face with a sinister expression, and slapped him familiarly on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Brandy," said Martin. "Brandy let it be! Nothing like brandy! Set out your pure
                  old Cogniac! Toby. A drink for the gods!"</p>
               <p>"Prime stuff! that. It warms you to the very soles of your feet!" added the, man
                  after he had turned off his glass. "Don't you say so, Martin?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! and through your stockings, to your very shoes!"</p>
               <p>"Hat ha! ha! He! he!" laughed the man with a forced effort. "Why, Bill Martin,
                  you're a wit!"</p>
               <p>"It ain't Bill, it's the brandy," said the bar-keeper, with more truth than
                  jest.</p>
               <p>"That brandy would put life into a grindstone!"</p>
               <p>"It's put life into our friend here, without doubt." And as the very disinterested
                  companion of Martin said this, he slapped him again upon the shoulder.</p>
               <p>The two men turned from the bar and sat down again by the stove, both getting more
                  and more familiar and chatty.</p>
               <p>"Suppose we try a game of dominoes or chequers?" at length suggested the
                  friend.</p>
               <p>"No objection," replied Martin. "Any thing to make the time pass agreeably.
                  Suppose we say chequers?"</p>
               <p>"Very well. Here's a board. We'll go into the backroom where it's more quiet."</p>
               <p>The two men retired into the little den in the rear of the bar-room, where were
                  several parties engaged at cards or dice.</p>
               <p>"Here's a cozy little corner," said the pleasant friend of Martin. "We can be as
                  quiet as kittens."</p>
               <p>"What's the stake?" he next inquired, as soon as the board was opened and the
                  pieces distributed. "Shall we say a bit?"</p>
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5627-00000145"/>
               <p>Martin received, at the close of each day, his earnings. Of his seventy-five
                  cents, he had already paid out for board thirty-one and a quarter cents; and for a
                  glass of liquor and some tobacco, six cents more. So he had but thirty-seven and a
                  half cents. This sum he drew from his pocket, and counted over with scrupulous
                  accuracy, so as to be sure of the amount. While he was doing so, his companion's
                  eyes were fixed eagerly upon the small coins in his hands, in order, likewise, to
                  ascertain their sum.</p>
               <p>"A bit let it be." And the man laid down a twelve-and-a-half-cent piece.</p>
               <p>"No! We'll start with a picayune," said Martin, selecting the smaller coin and
                  placing it on the table.</p>
               <p>"That's too trifling. Say a bit," returned the man, but half concealing the eager
                  impatience he felt to get hold of the poor wretch's money.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't care! Call it a bit, then," said Martin. And the coin was
                  staked.</p>
               <p>An observer would have been struck with the change that now came over Martin. His
                  dull eyes brightened; something like light came flashing into his almost
                  expressionless face, and his lips arched with the influx of new life and feeling.
                  He moved his pieces on the board with the promptness and skill of one accustomed
                  to the game, and, though he played with an opponent whose clearer head gave him an
                  advantage, he yet held his own with remarkable pertinacity, and was not beaten
                  until after a long and well-balanced struggle. But beaten he was; and one-third of
                  all he possessed in the world passed from his hand.</p>
               <p>Another twelve-and-a-half-cent piece was staked, and, in like manner, lost.</p>
               <p>"I can't go but a picayune this time," said Martin, when the pieces were arranged
                  for the third game. "My funds are getting too low."</p>
               <p>"Very well, a picayune let it be. Any thing just to give a little interest to the
                  game. I'm sure you'll win this time."</p>
               <p>And win Martin did. This elated him. He played another game and lost. The next was
                  no more successful. Only a single picayune now remained. For a short time he
                  hesitated about risking this. He wanted more liquor; and, if he lost, there would
                  be no means left to gratify the ever burning thirst that consumed him. Not until
                  the close of the next day would he receive any money; and, without money, he could
                  get nothing. There were unpaid scores against him in a dozen shops.</p>
               <p>"Try again. Don't be afraid. You're a better player than I am. You'll be sure to
                  win. Luck lies in the last sixpence. Don't you know that?"</p>
               <p>Thus urged, Martin put down the last small remnant of his day's earnings. The
                  interest taken in the games had nearly counteracted the effects of the liquor, and
                  he was, therefore, able to play with a skill nearly equal to that of his
                  companion. Slowly and thoughtfully he made his moves, and calculated the effect of
                  every change in the board with as much intelligence as it was possible for him to
                  summon to his aid. But luck, so called, was against him. His three last pieces,
                  kings, were swept from the board by a single play of his adversary, at a moment
                  when he believed himself sure of the game. A bitter imprecation fell from his
                  lips, as he turned from the table, and thrusting his hands nearly to his elbows in
                  his pockets, stalked into the bar-room, leaving the man who had won from him the
                  remnant of his day's earnings for the twentieth time, to enjoy the pleasures of
                  success. This man was too much occupied in kind attentions to others who were to
                  be his victims, to even see Martin again during the evening.</p>
               <p>After having lost his last farthing, the latter, feeling miserable enough, sat
                  down at a table on which were three or four newspapers, and tried to find in them
                  something to interest his mind. He was nearer to being sober than he had been for
                  many weeks. On the night before, he had gambled away his last penny, and the
                  consequence was, that he had been obliged to do without liquor all day. The
                  effects of the two glasses he had taken since nightfall had been almost entirely
                  obliterated by the excitement of the petty struggle through which he had passed,
                  and his mind was, therefore, in a more that usually disturbed state. The day had
                  been one of troubled feelings; and the night found him less happy than he had been
                  through the day.</p>
               <p>As he ran his eye over the newspaper he was trying to read, pausing now and then
                  at a paragraph, and seeking to find in it something of interest, the words,
                  "Thanksgiving in Massachusetts," arrested his attention, He read over the<pb
                     n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5627-00000146"/> few lines that followed this heading.
                  They were a simple statement of the fact, that a certain day in November had been
                  appointed as a thanksgiving day by the Governor of Massachusetts, followed by
                  these brief remarks by some editor who had recorded the fact:—"How many look
                  forward to this day as a time of joyful re-union! And such it is to thousands of
                  happy families. But, somehow, we always think of the vacant places that death or
                  absence leaves at many tables; and of the shadows that come over the feelings of
                  those who gather in the old homestead. Of the absent, how many are wanderers, like
                  the poor prodigal! And how gladly would they be received if they would only
                  return, and let all the unhappy past be forgotten and forgiven! Does, by any
                  chance, such a wanderer's eye fall upon these few sentences? If so, we do
                  earnestly and tenderly entreat him, by the love of his mother, that is still with
                  him, no matter how far he has gone from the right path, to come back on this
                  blessed day; and thus make the thanksgiving of that mother's heart complete."</p>
               <p>Every word of this appeal, which seemed as if it were addressed directly to
                  himself, touched a responsive feeling in the bosom of Martin. One after another,
                  images of other days passed before him—innocent, happy days. His mother's face,
                  his mother's voice, her very words were present with unwonted vividness. Then came
                  the recollection of blessed re-unions on the annual Thanksgiving festival. The
                  rush of returning memories was too strong for the poor, weak, depressed wanderer
                  from home and happiness. He felt the waters of repentance gathering in his eyes;
                  and he drew his hand suddenly across them, with an instinctive effort to check
                  their flow. But a fountain, long sealed, had been touched; and, ere he was more
                  than half aware of the tendency of his feelings, a tear came forth and rested on
                  his cheek. It was brushed away quickly. Another followed, and another. The man had
                  lost his self-control. Into one of the lowest haunts of vice and dissipation the
                  voice of his mother had come, speaking to him words of hope. Even here had her
                  image followed him, and he saw her with the old smile of love upon her face. And
                  he saw the smile give way to looks of sorrow, and heard the voice saying, in tones
                  of the tenderest entreaty, "William! my poor wanderer! come home! Come home!"</p>
               <p>Oh! with what deep, heart-aching sincerity did the poor wretch wish that he had
                  never turned aside into the ways of folly. "If I could but go home and die!" he
                  said, mentally.</p>
               <p>"If I could but feel my mother's hand upon my forehead, and hear her voice
                  again!"</p>
               <p>He had remained sitting at the table with the newspaper before his face, to hide
                  from other eyes all signs of emotion. But, the new feelings awakened were, in no
                  degree, congenial to the gross, depraved, and sensual sphere by which he was
                  surrounded; and, as he had no money left, and, therefore, no means of gratifying
                  his thirst for liquor, there was no inducement for him longer to breathe the
                  polluted atmosphere. Rising, therefore, he quietly retired; no one asking him to
                  stay or expressing surprise at his departure He had no money to spend at the bar,
                  nor to lose at the gaming. table; and was not, therefore, an object of the
                  slightest interest to any.</p>
               <p>As Martin stepped into the street, the cold rain struck him in the face, and the
                  chilly air penetrated his thin, tattered garments. The driving mist of the early
                  evening had changed to a heavy shower, and the street was covered with water.
                  Through this he plunged as he crossed over, and entered his boarding-house,
                  dripping from head to foot. He did not stop to speak with any one, but groped his
                  way, in the dark to the attic. Removing a portion of his wet clothing, he threw
                  himself upon his bed. He had not come to sleep, but to be alone that he might
                  think. But thought grew so painful that he would fain have found relief in
                  slumber, had that been possible.</p>
               <p>"If I had never strayed from the right path!" he murmured, as he tossed himself
                  uneasily. "Oh! if I had never strayed!"</p>
               <p>"Go back?" he said, aloud, after some minutes' silence, answering to his own
                  thoughts. "No—no! I will not blast them by my presence. Let them be happy."</p>
               <p>But the wish to return, once felt, grew every moment stronger, and he struggled
                  against it until, at last, after hours of bitter remorse and repentance, weary
                  nature yielded, and he fell off into a more quiet sleep than he had known for
                  weeks. In this sleep came many dreams, all of home, the old pleasant home, around
                  which clustered every<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5627-00000147"/> happy memory of
                  his life; and when morning came, it found him longing to return to that home with
                  an irrepressible desire.</p>
               <p>"I will go back," said he, in a firm voice, as he arose at day's dawn, his mind
                  clear and calm. "I will go home. Home—home!"</p>
               <p>This proved no mere effervescence of the mind. The idea, once fully entertained,
                  kept possession of his thoughts. His first resolution was to save his earnings
                  until he had enough to procure decent clothing and pay his passage back. A week he
                  kept to this resolution, not once tasting a drop of any intoxicating liquor. But
                  by that time he was so impatient of delay, that he changed his purpose, and
                  procured a situation as deck-hand on board a steamboat that was about leaving for
                  Pittsburg. For this service, he was to receive three dollars for the trip, besides
                  being furnished with his meals. During his week of sobriety, he had been able to
                  save two dollars. With this money he got an old pair of boots mended which his
                  employer at the manufactory had given him, and had his clothes repaired and
                  washed, all of which materially improved his appearance, and gave occasion for
                  several of his fellow-workmen to speak encouragingly, which strengthened him
                  greatly in his good purpose.</p>
               <p>During the passage up the river, Martin was subjected to many temptations, and
                  once or twice came near falling into his old ways. But thoughts of home came
                  stealing into his mind at the right moment, and saved him.</p>
               <p>With three dollars in his pocket, the wages he had received from the steamboat
                  captain, Martin started for Philadelphia on foot. He was eight days on the
                  journey. When he arrived, his boots were worn through, his money all expended, and
                  himself sick with fatigue, sad and dispirited. Luckily he met an old acquaintance,
                  who was a hand on board a schooner loading with coal for Boston. The vessel was to
                  pass through the canal, and then go by the way of Long Island Sound. Martin told
                  his story to this old crony, who had once been a hard drinker but was now
                  reformed, and he persuaded the captain to give him a passage.</p>
               <p>Just two weeks from the time of his leaving Cincinnati, Martin saw the sails
                  expand above him, and felt the onward ward movement of the vessel that was to bear
                  him homeward. His heart swelled with sad yet pleasant emotions. It was a long time
                  since he had heard from home; and longer still since he had seen the face of any
                  member of his family. For years he had been a wanderer. Now returning, a mere
                  wreck, so marred in every feature, and so changed, that even love would almost
                  fail to recognize him, the eyes of his mind were bent eagerly forward. And, as the
                  distance grew less and less, and he attempted to realize more and more perfectly
                  the meeting soon to take place, his heart would beat heavily in his bosom, and a
                  dimness come before his mental vision.</p>
               <p>Thanksgiving, that day of days in New England, had come round again. Among the
                  thousands by whom it was celebrated as a festive occasion, were the Martins, who
                  resided in a village only a few miles from Boston. Old Mr. and Mrs. Martin had
                  four children, two sons and two daughters. One of the daughters remained at home.
                  Rachel, the oldest of the daughters, was in her twenty-third year; and Martha was
                  nineteen. The former was married and lived in the village. Thomas, next older than
                  Rachel, was also married. He resided ten miles away. The oldest of them all,
                  William, was a wanderer; or, for ought they knew to the contrary, had long since
                  passed to his great account. As many as five years had gone by since there had
                  come from him any tidings; and nearly eight years since his place had been vacant
                  at the Thanksgiving re-unions.</p>
               <p>The day rose calm and bright on happy thousands. Perhaps no family in all New
                  England would have experienced a purer delight on this occasion, than that of the
                  Martins, had not the vacant place of an absent member reminded them of the
                  wandering, it might be the lost. Thomas was there with his gentle wife and three
                  bright children; Rachel with her husband and babe; and Martha with her sweet young
                  face, that was hardly ever guiltless of a smile. But William was away; and the
                  path in which he was treading, if he were yet alive, was hidden from their view by
                  clouds and darkness.</p>
               <p>Dinner, that chiefest event of every Thanksgiving day, was served immediately
                  after the return of the family from church. It had been prepared by the hands of
                     Martha,<pb n="292-295" xml:id="VAC5627-00000148"/> and she was in the act of
                  taking an enormous turkey from the oven, when a man came to the door, and, without
                  speaking a word, stood and looked at her attentively. She noticed him as she
                  turned from the oven. He was a sad looking object for a New England village on
                  Thanksgiving day. His eyes were sunken, his face thin and pale, and his old
                  tattered garments hung loosely on his meager limbs. He looked like one just from a
                  bed of sickness, and he bent, leaning upon a rough stick, like an old man yielding
                  to the weight of years. Yet, poor and weak as he seemed, his clothes were clean,
                  and his face had been recently shaven.</p>
               <p>Struck with his appearance, Martha paused and looked at him earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Will you let me rest here for a little while?" said the stranger, as soon as he
                  had attracted Martha's attention.</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes. Sit down," replied Martha, whose sympathies were instantly awakened by
                  the man's appearance. And she handed him a chair.</p>
               <p>Just then, Rachel, who had taken off her things on returning from church, came
                  into the kitchen to assist Martha with the dinner. She merely glanced at the man;
                  but he fixed upon her a most earnest look, and followed her about with his eyes as
                  she moved from one part of the room to another.</p>
               <p>"Martha!" called Mrs. Martin from the adjoining room. Neither of the sisters saw
                  the start which the man gave, nor observed the quick flush that went over his
                  face, as he turned his head in the direction from which the sound came.</p>
               <p>Martha ran in to see what her mother wanted. In a little while she came back, and,
                  as she entered the kitchen, she could not help remarking the strange earnestness
                  with which the man looked at her.</p>
               <p>Presently, Mrs. Martin herself came in. She was surprised at seeing the miserable
                  looking object who had intruded himself upon them at a time that seemed so
                  inopportune.</p>
               <p>"Who is that, Martha?" she asked in a low voice, aside.</p>
               <p>"I don't know," was answered in the same low tone—not so low, however, as to be
                  inaudible to the quick ears of the stranger.</p>
               <p>"What is he doing here?"</p>
               <p>"He asked me if I would let him rest for a little while; and I couldn't say
                  no."</p>
               <p>"He looks sick; and he must be very poor."</p>
               <p>"Yes, poor, indeed!" returned Mrs. Martin with a sigh; a thought of her own poor
                  wanderer crossing her mind. This thought caused her to turn to the man and say to
                  him,</p>
               <p>"Have you been sick, my friend?"</p>
               <p>The man who had been looking at her intently from the moment that she entered the
                  room, now turned his face partly away as he replied—</p>
               <p>"Yes. I've been sick for a number of days, but I am better now."</p>
               <p>"You look very poor."</p>
               <p>"I am poor—poor indeed!"</p>
               <p>"You do not belong to these parts?"</p>
               <p>"I do not deserve to," replied the man, low and evasively.</p>
               <p>"Where do your friends live?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know that I have any friends," said the man. There was a slight tremor in
                  his voice, that thrilled, answeringly, a chord in the heart of his questioner.</p>
               <p>"No friends!"</p>
               <p>"There still live those who were once my friends."</p>
               <p>"And why not your friends now?"</p>
               <p>The man shook his head, sadly.</p>
               <p>"I have proved myself unworthy, and, doubtless, they have long since cast me forth
                  from their regard."</p>
               <p>"Then you have no mother," said Mrs. Martin, quickly. "A mother's love cannot
                  die."</p>
               <p>"I have a mother, and I have sisters," replied the man, after a pause. "Feel
                  kindly towards me for their sakes. I have wandered long; but I am repentant; and,
                  now returning to my old home, I seek—"</p>
               <p>The voice that had been low and unsteady at the beginning, sunk sobbing into
                  silence, and the stranger's head drooped upon his bosom. At that moment, Mr.
                  Martin entered, and seeing the man, he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Who in the world is this?"</p>
               <p>"William?" fell half joyfully, half in doubting inquiry, from the mother's
                  lips.</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5627-00000149"/>
               <p>"My mother!" ejaculated the stranger, starting forward, and falling into her open
                  arms.</p>
               <p>"William—William!" said Mr. Martin. "Oh! no! It cannot be!"</p>
               <p>"It is! Yes! It is my poor, poor boy!" replied the mother, disengaging herself
                  from his clasping arms, and pushing him off so that she could get a full view of
                  his face. "Oh! William! My son! my son!" And again she hugged him wildly to her
                  bosom.</p>
               <p>How freely the tears of joy mingled on that happy Thanksgiving day, need not be
                  told. There was no longer a vacant place at the board; and thought turned not
                  away, doubtingly, in a vain search for the absent and the wandering. The long lost
                  had been found; the straying member had come home. Theirs was, indeed, a
                  Thanksgiving festival. Such joy as is felt in heaven over a sinner that repenteth,
                  made glad the mother's heart that day. And it has been glad ever since, for,
                  though Thanksgiving days have come again and again, there has been no absent
                  member since William's return.</p>

               <head>JIM BRADDOCK'S PLEDGE.</head>
               <p>"YOU'LL sign it, I'm sure," said a persevering Washingtonian, who had found his
                  way into a little village grogshop, and had there presented the pledge to some
                  three or four of its half-intoxicated inmates. The last man whom he addressed,
                  after having urged the others to no effect, was apparently about thirty years of
                  age, and had a sparkling eye, and a good-humoured countenance, that attracted
                  rather than repelled. The marks of the destroyer were, however, upon him, showing
                  themselves with melancholy distinctness.</p>
               <p>"You'll sign, I'm sure, Jim."</p>
               <p>"O, of course," replied the individual addressed, winking, as he did so to the
                  company, as much as to say—"Don't you want to see fun?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you will, I know?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I will. Where's the document?"</p>
               <p>"Here it is,"—displaying a sheet of paper with sundry appropriate devices, upon
                  which was printed in conspicuous letters,</p>
               <p>"We whose names—," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"That's very pretty, aint it, Ike?" said Jim, or James Braddock, with a mock
                  seriousness of tone and manner.</p>
               <p>"O, yes—very beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Just see here," ran on Jim, pointing to the vignette over the pledge.—"This
                  spruce chap, swelled out with cold-water until just ready to burst, and still
                  pouring in more, is our friend Malcom here, I suppose."</p>
               <p>A loud laugh followed this little hit, which seemed to the company exceedingly
                  humorous. But Malcom took it all in good part, and retorted by asking Braddock who
                  the wretched looking creature was with a bottle in his hand, and three ragged
                  children, and a pale, haggard, distressed woman, following after him.</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5627-00000150"/>
               <p>"Another cold-water man, I suppose, "Jim Braddock replied; but neither his laugh
                  nor the laugh of his cronies was so hearty as before.</p>
               <p>"O, no. That's a little mistake into which you have fallen, "Malcom said, smiling.
                  "He is one of your firewater men. Don't you see how he has been scorched with it,
                  inside and out. Now, did you ever see such a miserable looking creature? And his
                  poor children—and his wife! But I will say nothing about them. The picture speaks
                  for itself."</p>
               <p>"Here's a barrel, mount him up, and let us have a temperance speech!" cried the
                  keeper of the grog-shop, coming from behind his counter, and mingling with the
                  group.</p>
               <p>"O, yes.—Give us a temperance speech!" rejoined Jim Braddock, not at all sorry to
                  get a good excuse for giving up his examination of the pledge, which had revived
                  in his mind some associations of not the pleasantest character in the world.</p>
               <p>"No objection at all," replied the ready Washingtonian, mounting the rostrum which
                  the tavern-keeper had indicated, to the no small amusement of the company, and the
                  great relief of Jim Braddock, who began to feel that the laugh was getting on the
                  wrong side of his mouth, as he afterwards expressed it.</p>
               <p>"Now for some rare fun!" ejaculated one of the group that gathered around the
                  whiskey-barrel upon which Malcom stood.</p>
               <p>"This is grand sport!" broke in another.</p>
               <p>"Take your text, Mr. Preacher!" cried a third.</p>
               <p>"O yes, give us a text and a regular-built sermon!" added a fourth, rubbing his
                  hands with great glee.</p>
               <p>"Very well," Malcom replied, with good humour. "Now for the text."</p>
               <p>"Yes, give us the text," ran around the circle.</p>
               <p>"My text will be found in Harry Arnold's grog-shop, Main street, three doors from
                  the corner. It is in these words:—'Whiskey-barrel.' Upon this text I will now,
                  with your permission, make a few remarks."</p>
               <p>Then holding up his pledge and laying his finger upon the wretched being there
                  represented as the follower after strong drink, he went on—</p>
               <p>"You all see this poor creature here, and his wife and children—well, as my text
                  and his fall from happiness and respectability are inseparably united, I will,
                  instead of giving you a dry discourse on an empty whiskey-barrel, narrate this
                  man's history, which involves the whiskey-barrel, and describes how it became
                  empty, and finally how it came here. I will call him James Bradly—but take notice,
                  that I call him a little out of his true name, so as not to seem personal.</p>
               <p>"Well, this James Bradly was a house-carpenter—I say <emph>was</emph>—for although
                  still living, he is no longer an industrious house-carpenter, but a very
                  industrious grog-drinker,—he has changed his occupation. About five years ago, I
                  went to his house on some business. It was about dinner-time, and the table was
                  set, and the dinner on it.</p>
               <p>"'Come, take some dinner with me,' Mr. Bradly said, in such a kind earnest way,
                  that I could not resist, especially as his wife looked so happy and smiling, and
                  the dinner so neatly served, plentiful and inviting. So I sat down with Mr. and
                  Mrs. Bradly, and two fat, chubby-faced children; and I do not think I ever enjoyed
                  so pleasant a meal in my life.</p>
               <p>"After dinner was over, Mr. Bradly took me all through his house, which was new.
                  He had just built it, and furnished it with every convenience that a man in mode.
                  rate circumstances could desire. I was pleased with everything I saw, and praised
                  everything with a hearty good will. At last he took me down into the cellar, and
                  showed me a barrel of flour that he had just bought—twenty bushels of potatoes and
                  turnips laid in for the winter, five large fat hogs, and I can't remember what
                  all. Beside these, there was a barrel of something lying upon the cellar
                  floor.</p>
               <p>"'What is this?' I asked.</p>
               <p>"'O, that is a barrel of whiskey that I have laid in also.'</p>
               <p>"'A barrel of whiskey!' I said, in surprise.</p>
               <p>"'Yes. I did some work for Harry Arnold, and the best I could do was to take this
                  barrel of good old 'rye' in payment. But it is just as well. It will be a saving
                  in the end.'</p>
               <pb n="300" xml:id="VAC5627-00000151"/>
               <p>"'How so?' I asked.</p>
               <p>"'Why, because there are more than twice as many drams in this barrel of whiskey,
                  as I could get for what I paid for it. Of course, I save more than half.'</p>
               <p>"'But have you taken into your calculation the fact, that, in consequence of
                  having a barrel of whiskey so handy, you will drink about two glasses to one that
                  you would want if you had to go down to Harry Arnold's for it every time!'</p>
               <p>"'O yes, I have,' Bradly replied. 'But still I calculate on it being a saving,
                  from the fact that I shall not lose so much time as I otherwise would do. A great
                  deal of time, you know, is wasted in these dram-shops.'</p>
               <p>"'All true. But have you never considered the danger arising from the habitual
                  free use of liquor—such a free use as the constant sight of a whole barrel of
                  whiskey may induce you to make?'</p>
               <p>"'Danger!' ejaculated Mr. Bradly in surprise.</p>
               <p>"'Yes, danger,' I repeated.</p>
               <p>"'Of what?' he asked.</p>
               <p>"'Of becoming too fond of liquor,' I replied.</p>
               <p>"'I hope you do not wish to insult me in my own house, Mr. Malcom,' the carpenter
                  said, rather sternly.</p>
               <p>"'O no,' I replied. 'Of course I do not. I only took the liberty that a friend
                  feels entitled to use, to hint at what seemed to me a danger that you might be
                  running into blindly.'</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Bradly, who had gone through the house with us, enjoying my admiration of
                  all their comfortable arrangements, seemed to dwell with particular interest on
                  what I said in reference to the whiskey-barrel. She was now leaning affectionately
                  upon her husband's arm—her own drawn through his, and her hands clasped
                  together—looking up into his face with a tender and confiding regard. I could not
                  help noticing her manner, and the expression of her countenance. And yet it seemed
                  to me that something of concern was on her face, but so indistinct as to be
                  scarcely visible. Of this I was satisfied, when she said,</p>
               <p>"'I don't think there is much use in drinking liquor, do you, Mr. Malcom?'</p>
               <p>"'I cannot see that there is,' I replied, of course.</p>

               <p>"'Nor can I. Of one thing I think I am certain, and that is, that James would be
                  just as comfortable and happy without it as with it.'</p>
               <p>"'You don't know what you are talking about, Sally,' her husband replied
                  good-humouredly, for he was a man of excellent temper, and a little given to
                  jesting. 'But I suppose you thought it good for you last christmas, when you got
                  boozy on egg-nog.'</p>
               <p>"'O James, how can you talk so!' his wife exclaimed, her face reddening. 'You know
                  that you served me a shameful trick then.'</p>
               <p>"'What do you think he did, Mr. Malcom?' she added, turning to me, while her
                  husband laughed heartily at what she said. 'He begged me to let him make me a
                  little wine egg-nog, seeing that I wouldn't touch that which had brandy in it,
                  because liquor always flies to my head. To please him, I consented, though I
                  didn't want it. And then, the rogue fixed me a glass as strong again with brandy
                  as that which I had refused to take. I thought while I was drinking it, that it
                  did not taste like wine, and told him so. But he declared that it was wine, and
                  that it was so sweet that I could not clearly perceive its flavour. Of course I
                  had to go to bed, and didn't get fairly over it for two or three days. Now, wasn't
                  that too bad, Mr. Malcom!'</p>
               <p>"'Indeed it was, Mrs. Bradly,' I said in reply.</p>
               <p>"'It was a capital joke, though, wasn't it?' rejoined her husband, laughing
                  immoderately.</p>
               <p>"'I'll tell you a good way to retort on him,' I said, jestingly.</p>
               <p>"'How is that, Mr. Malcom?'</p>
               <p>"Pull the tap out of his whiskey-barrel.'</p>
               <p>"'I would, if I dared.'</p>
               <p>"'She'd better not try that, I can tell her.'</p>
               <p>"'What would you do, if I did?' she asked.</p>
               <p>"'Buy two more in its place, and make you drink one of them.'</p>
               <p>"'O dear! I must beg to be excused from that. But, indeed, James, I wish you would
                  let it run. I'm really ashamed to have it said, that my husband keeps a barrel of
                  whiskey in the house.'</p>

               <p>"'Nonsense, Sally! you don't know what you are talking about.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, perhaps I don't,' the wife said, and remained silent, for there was a
                  half-concealed rebuke in her husband's tone of voice.</p>
               <p>"I saw that I could say no more about the whiskey-barrel, and so I dropped the
                  subject, and, in a short time, after having finished my business with Mr. Bradly,
                  went away.</p>
               <p>"'Well, how comes on the whiskey-barrel?' I said to him, about a month after, as
                  we met on the road.</p>
               <p>"'First-rate,' was his reply. 'It contains a prime article of good old 'rye,' I
                  can tell you. The best I have ever tasted. Come, won't you go home with me and try
                  some?'</p>
               <p>"'No, I believe not.'"</p>
               <p>"'Do now—come along,' and he took me by the button, and pulled me gently. 'You
                  don't know how fine it is. I am sure there is not another barrel like it in the
                  town.'</p>
               <p>"'You must really excuse me, Bradly,' I replied, for I found that he was in
                  earnest, and what was more, had a watery look about the eyes, that argued badly
                  for him, I thought.</p>
               <p>"'Well, if you won't, you won't,' he said. 'But you always were an unsocial kind
                  of a fellow.'</p>
               <p>"And so we parted. Six months had not passed before it was rumoured through the
                  neighbourhood, that Bradly had begun to neglect his business; and that he spent
                  too much of his time at Harry Arnold's. I met his wife one day, about this time,
                  and, really, her distressed look gave me the heart ache. Something is wrong,
                  certainly, I said to myself. It was only a week after, that I met poor Bradly
                  intoxicated.</p>
               <p>"'Ah, Malcom—good day—How are you?' he said, reeling up to me and offering his
                  hand.—'You havn't tried that good old rye of mine yet. Come along now, it's most
                  gone.'</p>
               <p>"'You must excuse me today, Mr. Bradly,' I replied, trying to pass on.</p>
               <p>"But he said I should not get off this time—that home with him I must go, and take
                  a dram from his whiskey-barrel. Of course, I did not go. If there had been no
                  other reason, I had no desire, I can assure you, to meet his wife while her
                  husband was in so sad a condition. After awhile I got rid of him, and right glad
                  was I to do so."</p>
               <p>"Come, that'll do for one day!" broke in Harry Arnold, the grog-shop-keeper, at
                  this point, not relishing too well the allusions to himself, nor, indeed, the
                  drift of the narrative, which he very well understood.</p>
               <p>"No—no—go on! go on!" urged two or three of the group. But Jim Braddock said
                  nothing, though he looked very thoughtful.</p>
               <p>"I'll soon get through," replied the Washingtonian, showing no inclination to
                  abandon his text. "You see, I did not, of course, go home with poor Bradly, and he
                  left me with a drunken, half-angry malediction. That night he went down into his
                  cellar, late, to draw some whiskey, and forgot his candle, which had been so
                  carelessly set down, that it set fire to a shelf, and before it was discovered the
                  fire had burned through the floor above.</p>
               <p>"Nearly all their furniture was saved, whiskey-barrel and all, but the house was
                  burned to the ground. Since that time, Bradly will tell you that luck has been
                  against him. He has been going down, down, down, every year, and now does scarcely
                  anything but lounge about Harry Arnold's grog-shop and drink, while his poor wife
                  and children are in want and suffering, and have a most wretched look, as you may
                  see by this picture on the pledge. As for the whiskey-barrel, that was rolled down
                  here about a month ago, and sold for half a dollar's worth of liquor, and here I
                  now stand upon it, and make it the foundation of a temperance speech.</p>
               <p>"Now, let me ask you all seriously, if you do not think that James Bradly owes his
                  rapid downfall, in a great measure, to the fact that Harry Arnold would not pay
                  him a just debt in anything but whiskey? And against Harry Arnold really your
                  friend, that you are so willing to beggar your wives and children to put money in
                  his till? I only ask the questions. You can answer then at your leisure. So ends
                  my speech."</p>
               <p>"You are an insulting fellow, let me tell you!" the grog-shop-keeper said, as he
                  turned away, angrily, and went behind his counter.</p>
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5627-00000154"/>
               <p>The Washingtonian took no notice of this, but went to Jim Braddock, who stood in a
                  musing attitude near the door, and said—</p>
               <p>"You will sign now, won't you, Jim?"</p>
               <p>"No, I will not!" was his gruff response.</p>
               <p>"I am not going to sign away my liberty for you or anybody else. So long as I
                  live, I'll be a free man."</p>
               <p>"That's right, Jim! Huzza for liberty!" shouted his companions.</p>
               <p>"Yes, huzza for liberty! say I," responded Braddock, in the effort to rally
                  himself, and shake off the thoughts and feelings that. Malcom's narrative had
                  conjured up a narrative that proved to be too true a history of his own
                  downfall.</p>
               <p>"It was a shame for you to do what you did down at Harry Arnold's," Braddock said
                  to the Washingtonian about half an hour afterwards, meeting him on the street.</p>
               <p>"Do what, Jim!"</p>
               <p>"Why, rake up all my past history as you did, and insult Harry in his own house
                  into the bargain."</p>
               <p>"How did I insult Harry Arnold?"</p>
               <p>"By telling about that confounded whiskey-barrel that I have wished a hundred
                  times had been in the bottom of the sea, before it ever fell into my hands."</p>
               <p>"I told the truth, didn't I?"</p>
               <p>"O yes—it was all true enough, and a great deal too true."</p>
               <p>"He owed you a bill?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And you wanted your money?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"But Harry wouldn't pay you in anything but whiskey?"</p>
               <p>"No, he would not."</p>
               <p>"And so you took a barrel of whiskey, that you did not want, in payment?"</p>
               <p>"I did."</p>
               <p>"But would much rather have had the money?"</p>
               <p>"Of course, I would."</p>
               <p>"And yet, you are so exceedingly tender of Harry Arnold's feelings,
                  notwithstanding his agency in your ruin, that you would not have him reminded of
                  his original baseness—or rather his dishonesty in not paying you in money,
                  according to your understanding with him, for your work?"</p>
               <p>"I don't see any use in raking up these old things."</p>
               <p>"The use is, to enable you to see your folly so clearly as to cause you to abandon
                  it. I am sure you not only see it now, but feel it strongly."</p>
               <p>"Well, suppose I do?—what then?"</p>
               <p>"Why, sign the pledge, and become a sober man."</p>
               <p>"I've made up my mind never to sign a pledge," was the emphatic answer.</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because, I am determined to live and die a free man. I'll never sign away my
                  liberty. My father was a free man before me, and I will live and die a free
                  man!"</p>
               <p>"But you're a slave now."</p>
               <p>"It is not true! I am free.—Free to drink, or free to et it alone, as I
                  choose."</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken, Jim. You have sold yourself into slavery, and the marks of the
                  chains that still bind you, are upon your body. You are the slave of a vile
                  passion that is too strong for your reason."</p>
               <p>"I deny it. I can quit drinking if I choose."</p>
               <p>"Then why don't you quit?"</p>
               <p>"Because I love to drink."</p>
               <p>"And love to see your wife's cheek growing paler and paler every day—and your
                  children ragged and neglected?"</p>
               <p>"Malcom!"</p>
               <p>"I only asked the question, Jim."</p>
               <p>"But you know that I don't love to see them in the condition they are."</p>
               <p>"And still, you say that you can quit drinking whenever you choose, but will not
                  do so, because you love the taste, or the effect of the liquor, I don't know
                  which?"</p>
               <p>Braddock's feelings were a good deal touched, as they had been, ever since
                  Malcom's temperance speech in the grog-shop. He stood silent for some time, and
                  then said—</p>
               <p>"I know it's too bad for me to drink as I do, but I will break off."</p>
               <p>"You had better sign the pledge then."</p>
               <p>"No, I will not do that. As I have told you, I am resolved never to sign away my
                  liberty."</p>
               <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC5627-00000155"/>
               <p>"Very well. If you are fixed in your resolution, I suppose it is useless for me to
                  urge the matter. For the sake, then, of your wife and children, break away from
                  the fetters that bind you, and be really free. Now you are not only a slave, but a
                  slave in the most debasing bondage."</p>
               <p>The two then separated, and Jim Braddock—in former years it was Mr.
                  Braddock—returned to his house; a very cheerless place, to what it had once been.
                  Notwithstanding his abandonment of himself to drink and idleness, Braddock had no
                  ill-nature about him. Though he neglected his family, he was not quarrelsome at
                  home. she might, and talked hard to him, he never retorted, but always turned the
                  matter off with a laugh or a jest. With his children, he was always cheerful, and
                  frequently joined in their sports, when not too drunk to do so. All this cool
                  indifference, as it seemed to her, frequently irritated his wife, and made her
                  scold away at him with might and main. He had but one reply to make whenever this
                  occurred, and that was—</p>
               <p>"There—there—Keep cool, Sally! It will all go in your lifetime, darling!"</p>
               <p>As he came into the house after the not very pleasant occurrence that had taken
                  place at Harry Arnold's, he saw by Sally's excited face and sparkling eyes that
                  something was wrong.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, Sally?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Don't ask me what's the matter, if you please!" was her tart reply.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I want to know? Something is wrong."</p>
               <p>"Something is always wrong, of course," Sally rejoined—"and something always will
                  be wrong while you act as you do: It's a burning shame for any man to abuse his
                  family as you are abusing yours. Jim—"</p>
               <p>"There—there. Keep cool, Sally! It will all go in your lifetime, darling!" Jim
                  responded, in a mild, soothing tone.</p>
               <p>"O yes:—It's very easy to say 'keep cool!' But I'm tired of this everlasting 'keep
                  cool!' Quit drinking and go to work, and then it'll be time to talk about keeping
                  cool. Here I've been all the morning scraping up chips to make the fire burn. Not
                  a stick in the wood-pile, and you lazing it down to Harry Arnold's. I wish to
                  goodness he was hung! It's too bad! I'm out of all manner of patience!"</p>
               <p>"There—there. Keep cool, Sally! It'll all go—"</p>
               <p>"Hush, will you!" ejaculated Sally, stamping her foot, all patience having left
                  her over-tried spirit. "Keep away from Harry Arnold's! Quit drinking, and then
                  it'll be time for you to talk to me about keeping cool!"</p>
               <p>"I'm going to quit, Sally," Jim replied, altogether unexcited by her words and
                  manner.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" rejoined Sally. "You've said that fifty times."</p>
               <p>"But I'm going to do it now."</p>
               <p>"Have you signed the pledge?"</p>
               <p>"No. I'm not going to sign away my liberty, as I have often said. But I'm going to
                  quit."</p>
               <p>"Fiddle-de-de! Sign away your liberty! You've got no liberty to sign away! A
                  slave, and talk of liberty!"</p>
               <p>"Look here, Sally," her husband said, good-humouredly, for nothing that she could
                  say ever made him get angry with her—"you're a hard-mouthed animal, and it would
                  take a strong hand to hold you in. But as I like to see you go at full gallop,
                  darling, I never draw a tight rein. Aint you most out of breath yet?"</p>
               <p>"You're a fool, Jim!"</p>
               <p>"There's many a true word spoken in jest, Sally," her husband responded in a more
                  serious tone; "I have been a most egregious fool—but I'm going to try and act the
                  wise man, if I havn't forgotten how. So now, as little Vic. said to her mother— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Pray, Goody, cease and moderate</l>
                        <l>The rancour of your tongue.'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Suddenly his wife felt that he was really in earnest, and all her angry feelings
                  subsided—</p>
               <p>"O James!" she said—"if you would only be as you once were, how happy we might all
                  again be!"</p>
               <p>"I know that, Sally. And I'm going to try hard to be as I once was. There's a
                  little job to be done over at Jones', and I promised him that I would do it for
                  him today. but I got down to Harry Arnold's, and there wasted my time until I was
                  ashamed to begin a day's work. But<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5627-00000156"/>
                  to-morrow morning I'll go over, and stick at it until it's done. It'll be cash
                  down, and you shall have every cent it comes to, my old girl!" patting his wife on
                  the cheek as he said so.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Braddock, of course, felt a rekindling of hope in her bosom. Many times
                  before had her husband promised amendment, and as often had he disappointed her
                  fond expectations. But still she suffered her heart to hope again.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, James Braddock found an early breakfast ready for him when he
                  got up. His hand trembled a good deal as he lifted his cup of coffee to his lips,
                  which was insipid without the usual morning-dram to put a taste in his mouth. He
                  did not say much, for he felt an almost intolerable craving for liquor, and this
                  made him serious. But his resolution was strong to abandon his former habits.</p>
               <p>"You won't forget, James?" his wife said, laying her hand upon his arm, and
                  looking him earnestly and with moistened eyes in the face, as he was about leaving
                  the house.</p>
               <p>"No, Sally, I won't forget. Take heart, my good girl. Let what's past go for
                  nothing. It's all in our lifetime."</p>
               <p>And so saying, Braddock turned away, and strode off with a resolute bearing. His
                  wife followed with her eyes the form of her husband until it was out of sight, and
                  then closed the door with a long-drawn sigh.</p>
               <p>The way to Mr. Jones' house was past Arnold's grogshop, and as Braddock drew
                  nearer and nearer to his accustomed haunt, he felt a desire, growing stronger and
                  stronger every moment, to enter and join his old associates over a glass of
                  liquor. To this desire, he opposed every rational objection that he could find. He
                  brought up before his mind his suffering wife and neglected children, and thought
                  of his duty to them. He remembered that it was drink, and drink alone, that had
                  been the cause of his downfall. But with all these auxiliaries to aid him in
                  keeping his resolution, it seemed weak when opposed to desires, which long
                  continued indulgence had rendered inordinate. Onward he went with a steady pace,
                  fortifying his mind all the while with arguments against drinking, and yet just
                  ready at every moment to yield the contest he was waging against habit and desire.
                  At last the grog-shop was in sight, and in a few minutes he was almost at the
                  door.</p>
               <p>"Hurrah! Here's Jim Braddock, bright and early!" cried one of his old cronies,
                  from among two or three who were standing in front of the shop.</p>
               <p>"So the cold-water-men havn't got you yet!" broke in another. "I thought Jim
                  Braddock was made of better stuff."</p>
               <p>"Old birds aint caught with chaff!" added a third.</p>
               <p>"Come! Hallo! Where are you off to in such a hurry, with your tools on your back?"
                  quickly cried the first speaker, seeing that Braddock was going by without showing
                  any disposition to stop.</p>
               <p>"I've got a job to do that's in a hurry," replied Braddock, pausing—"and have no
                  time to stop. And besides, I've sworn off."</p>
               <p>"Sworn off! Ha! ha! Have you taken the pledge?"</p>
               <p>"No, I have not. I'm not going to bind myself down not to drink any thing. I'll be
                  a free man. But I won't touch another drop, see if I do."</p>
               <p>"O yes—we'll see. How long do you expect to keep sober?"</p>
               <p>"Always."</p>
               <p>"You'll be drunk by night."</p>
               <p>"Why do you say so?"</p>
               <p>"I say so—that's all; and I know so."</p>
               <p>"But why do you say so? Come, tell me that."</p>
               <p>"O, I've seen too many swear off in my time—and I've tried it too often myself.
                  It's no use. Not over one in a hundred ever sticks to it; and I'm sure, Jim
                  Braddock's not that exception."</p>
               <p>"There are said to be a hundred reformed men in this town now. I am sure, I know a
                  dozen," Braddock replied.</p>
               <p>"O yes. But they've signed the pledge."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! I don't believe a man can keep sober any the better by signing the
                  pledge, than by resolving never again to drink a drop."</p>
               <p>"Facts are stubborn things, you know. But come, Jim, as you havn't signed the
                  pledge, you might as well come<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC5627-00000157"/> in and
                  take a glass now, for you'll do it before night, take my word for it."</p>
               <p>It was a fact, that Braddock began really to debate the question with himself,
                  whether he should or not go in and take a single glass, when he became suddenly
                  conscious of his danger, turned away, and hurried on, followed by the loud,
                  jeering laugh of his old boon companions.</p>
               <p>"Up-hill work," he muttered to himself, as he strode onward.</p>
               <p>An hour's brisk walking brought him to the residence of Mr. Jones, nearly four
                  miles away from the little town in which he lived, where he entered upon his day's
                  work, resolved that, henceforth, he would be a reformed man. At first he was
                  nervous, from want of his accustomed stimulus, and handled his tools awkwardly.
                  But after awhile, as the blood began to circulate more freely, the tone of his
                  system came up to a healthier action.</p>
               <p>About eleven o'clock Mr. Jones came out to the building upon which Braddock was at
                  work, and after chatting a little, said—</p>
               <p>"This is grog time, aint it, Jim?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, I believe it is," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Well, knock off then for a little while, and come into the house and take a
                  dram."</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Jones was a very moderate drinker himself, scarcely touching liquor for
                  weeks at a time, unless in company. But he always kept it in the house, and always
                  gave it to his workmen, as a matter of course, at eleven o'clock. Had he been
                  aware of Braddock's effort to reform himself, he would as soon have thought of
                  offering him poison to drink as whiskey. But, knowing his habits, he concluded,
                  naturally, that the grog was indispensable, and tendered it to him as he had
                  always done before, on like occasions.</p>
               <p>"I've signed the pledge," were the words that instantly formed themselves in the
                  mind of Braddock—but were instantly set aside, as that reason for not drinking
                  would not have been the true one. Could he have said that, all difficulty would
                  have vanished in a moment.</p>
               <p>"No objection, Mr. Jones," was then uttered, and off he started for the house,
                  resolutely keeping down every reason that struggled in his mind to rise and be
                  heard. The image of Mr. Jones, standing before him, with a smiling invitation to
                  come and take a glass, backed by his own instantly aroused inclinations, had been
                  too strong an inducement. He felt, too, that it would have been rudeness to
                  decline the proffered hospitality.</p>
               <p>"That's not bad to take, Mr. Jones," he said, smacking his lips, after turning off
                  a stiff glass.</p>
               <p>"No, it is not, Jim. That's as fine an article of whiskey as I've ever seen," Mr.
                  Jones replied, a little flattered at Braddock's approval of his liquor. "You're a
                  good judge of such matters."</p>
               <p>"I ought to be." And as Jim said this, he turned out another glass.</p>
               <p>"That's right—help yourself," was Mr. Jones' encouraging remark, as he saw
                  this.</p>
               <p>"I never was backward at that, you know, Mr. Jones." After eating a cracker and a
                  piece of cheese, and taking a third drink, Braddock went back and resumed his
                  work, feeling quite happy.</p>
               <p>After dinner Mr. Jones handed him the bottle again, and did the same when he
                  knocked off in the evening. Of course, he was very far from being sober when he
                  started for home. As he came into town, his way was past Harry Arnold's, whose
                  shop he entered, and was received with a round of applause by his old associates,
                  who saw at a glance that Jim was "a little disguised." Their jokes were all
                  received in good part, and parried by treating all around.</p>
               <p>When her husband left in the morning, Mrs. Braddock's heart was lightened with a
                  new hope, although a fear was blended with that hope, causing them both to tremble
                  in alternate preponderance in her bosom. Still, hope would gain the ascendency,
                  and affected her spirits with a degree of cheerfulness unfelt for many months. As
                  the day began to decline towards evening, after putting everything about the house
                  in order, she took her three children, washed them clean, and dressed them up as
                  neatly as their worn and faded clothes would permit. This was in order to make
                  home present the most agreeable appearance possible to her husband when he
                  returned. Then she killed a chicken and dressed it, ready to broil for his
                  supper—made up a nice short-cake, and set the table with a clean, white
                  table-cloth. About sundown, she commenced<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC5627-00000158"
                  /> baking the cake, and cooking the chicken, and at dusk had them all ready to put
                  on the table the moment he came in.</p>
               <p>Your father is late," she remarked to one of the children, after sitting in a
                  musing attitude for about five minutes, after everything was done that she could
                  do towards getting supper ready. As she said this, she got up and went to the door
                  and looked long and intently down the street in the direction that she expected
                  him, calling each distant, dim figure, obscured by the deepening twilight, his,
                  until a nearer approach dispelled the illusion. Each disappointment like this,
                  caused her feelings to grow sadder and sadder, until at length, as evening
                  subsided into night, with its veil of thick darkness, she turned into the house
                  with a heavy oppressive sigh, and rejoined the children who were impatient for
                  their supper.</p>
               <p>"Wait a little while," was her reply to their importunities. "Father will soon be
                  here now."</p>
               <p>She was still anxious that their father should see their improved appearance.</p>
               <p>"O no"—urged one. "We want our supper now."</p>
               <p>"O yes. Give us our supper now. I'm so sleepy and hungry," whined another.</p>
               <p>And to give force to these, the youngest began to fret and cry. Mrs. Braddock
                  could delay no longer, and so she set them up to the table and gave them as much
                  as they could eat. Then she undressed each in turn, and in a little while, they
                  were fast asleep.</p>
               <p>When all was quiet, and the mother sat down to wait for her husband's return, a
                  feeling of deep despondency came over her mind. It had been dark for an hour, and
                  yet he had not come home. She could imagine no reason for this, other than the one
                  that had kept him out so often before—drinking and company. Thus she continued to
                  sit, hour after hour, the supper untasted. Usually, her evenings were spent in
                  some kind of work—in mending her children's clothes, or knitting them stockings.
                  But now she had no heart to do anything. The state of gloomy uncertainty that she
                  was in, broke down her spirits, for the time being.</p>
               <p>Bedtime came; and still Braddock was away. She waited an hour later than usual,
                  and then retired, sinking back upon her pillow as she did so, in a state of
                  hopeless exhaustion of mind and body.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, her husband had spent a merry evening at Harry Arnold's, drinking
                  with more than his accustomed freedom. He was the last to go home, the thought of
                  meeting his deceived and injured wife, causing him to linger. When he did leave,
                  it was past eleven o'clock. Though more than half-intoxicated on going from the
                  grog-shop, the cool night air, and the thought of Sally, sobered him considerably
                  before he got home. Arrived there, he paused with his hand on the door for some
                  time, reluctant to enter. At last he opened the door, and went quietly in, in the
                  hope of getting up to bed without his wife's discovering his condition. The third
                  step into the room brought his foot in contact with a chair, and over he went,
                  jarring the whole house with his fall. His wife heard this—indeed her quick ear
                  had detected the opening of the door—and it caused her heart to sink like a heavy
                  weight in her bosom.</p>
               <p>Gathering himself up, Braddock moved forward again as steadily as he could, both
                  hands extended before him. A smart blow upon the nose from an open door, that had
                  insinuated itself between his hands, brought him up again, and caused him,
                  involuntarily, to dash aside the door which shut with a heavy slam. Pausing now,
                  to recall his bewildered senses, he resolved to move forward with more caution,
                  and so succeeded in gaining the stairs, up which he went, his feet, softly as he
                  tried to put them down, falling like heavy lumps of lead, and making the house
                  echo again. He felt strongly inclined to grumble about all the lights being put
                  out, as he came into the chamber—but a distinct consciousness that he had no right
                  to grumble, kept him quiet, and so he undressed himself with as little noise as
                  possible,—which was no very small portion, for at almost every moment he stept on
                  something, or ran against something that seemed endowed for the time with sonorous
                  power of double the ordinary capacity,—and crept softly into bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Braddock said nothing, and he said nothing. But long before her eyelids
                  closed in sleep, he was loudly snoring by her side. When he awoke in the morning,
                  Sally had arisen and gone down. A burning thirst caused<pb n="316-317"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000159"/> him to get up immediately and dress himself. There
                  was no water in the room, and if there had been, he could not have touched it
                  while there was to be had below a cool draught from the well. So he descended at
                  once, feeling very badly, and resolving over again that he would never touch
                  another drop of liquor as long as he lived. Having quenched his thirst with a
                  large bowl of cool water drawn right from the bottom of the well, he went up to
                  his wife where she was stooping at the fire, and said—</p>
               <p>"Sally, look here—"</p>
               <p>"Go 'way, Jim," was her angry response.</p>
               <p>"No, but Sally, look here, I want to talk to you," persisted her husband.</p>
               <p>"Go 'way, I say—I don't care if I never see you again!"</p>
               <p>"So you've said a hundred times, but I never believed you, or I might have taken
                  you at your word."</p>
               <p>To this his wife made no reply.</p>
               <p>"I was drunk last night, Sally," Jim said, after a moment's silence.</p>
               <p>"You needn't take the trouble to tell me that."</p>
               <p>"Of course not. But an open confession, you know, is good for the soul. I was
                  drunk last night, then—drunk as a fool, after all I promised—but I'm not going to
                  get drunk again, so—"</p>
               <p>"Don't swear any more false oaths, Jim: you've sworn enough already."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but Sally, I am going to quit now, and I want you to talk to me like a good
                  wife, and advise with me."</p>
               <p>"If you don't go away and let me alone now, I'll throw these tongs at you!" the
                  wife rejoined, angrily, rising up and brandishing the article she had named. "You
                  are trying me beyond all manner of patience!"</p>
               <p>"There—there—keep cool, Sally. It'll all go into your lifetime, darlin'," Jim
                  replied, good-humouredly, taking hold of her hand, and extricating the tongs from
                  them, and then drawing his arm around her waist, and forcing her to sit down in a
                  chair, while he took one just beside her.</p>
               <p>"Now, Sally, I'm in dead earnest, if ever I was in my life," he began, "and if
                  you'll tell me any way to break off from this wretched habit into which I have
                  fallen, I'll do it."</p>
               <p>"Go and sign the pledge, then;" his wife said promptly, and somewhat sternly.</p>
               <p>"And give up my liberty?"</p>
               <p>"And regain it, rather. You're a slave now."</p>
               <p>"I'll do it, then, for your sake."</p>
               <p>"Don't trifle with me, any more, James; I can't bear it much longer, I feel that I
                  can't—" poor Mrs. Braddock said in a plaintive tone, while the tears came to her
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"I wont deceive you any more, Sally. I'll sign, and I'll keep my pledge. If I
                  could only have said—'I've signed the pledge,' yesterday, I would have been safe.
                  But I've got no pledge, and I'm afraid to go out to hunt up Malcom, for fear I
                  shall see a grog-shop."</p>
               <p>"Can't you write a pledge?"</p>
               <p>"No. I can't write anything but a bill, or a label for one of your
                  pickle-pots."</p>
               <p>"But try."</p>
               <p>"Well, give me a pen, some ink, and a piece of paper."</p>
               <p>But there was neither pen, ink, nor paper, in the house. Mrs. Braddock, however,
                  soon mustered them all in the neighbourhood, and came and put them down upon the
                  table before her husband.</p>
               <p>"There, now, write a pledge," she said.</p>
               <p>"I will." And Jim took up the pen and wrote— <q>

               <p>"But that's a queer pledge, Jim."</p>
               <p>"I don't care if it is. I'll keep it."</p>
               <p>"It's just no pledge at all."</p>
               <p>"You're an old goose! Now give me a hammer and four nails."</p>
               <p>"What do you want with a hammer and four nails?"</p>
               <p>"I want to nail my pledge up over the mantelpiece."</p>
               <p>"But it will get smoky."</p>
               <p>"So will your aunty. Give me the hammer and nails."</p>
               <p>Jim's wife brought them as desired, and he nailed his pledge up over the
                  mantelpiece, and then read it off with a proud, resolute air.</p>
               <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC5627-00000160"/>
               <p>"I can keep that pledge, Sally, my old girl! And what's more, I will keep it,
                  too!" he said, slapping his wife upon the shoulder. "And now for some breakfast in
                  double quick time, for I must be at Jones's early this morning."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Braddock's heart was very glad, for she had more faith in this pledge than
                  she had ever felt in any of his promises. There was something of confirmation in
                  the act of signing his name, that strengthened her hopes. It was not long before
                  she had a good warm breakfast on the table, of which her husband eat with a better
                  appetite than usual, and then, after reading his pledge over, Jim started off.</p>
               <p>As before, he had to go past Harry Arnold's, and early as it was, there were
                  already two or three of his cronies there for their morning dram. He saw them
                  about the door while yet at a distance, but neither the grog-shop nor his old
                  companions had now any attraction for him. He was conscious of standing on a plain
                  that lifted him above their influence. As he drew near, they observed him, and
                  awaited his approach with pleasure, for his fine flow of spirits made his company
                  always desirable. But as he showed no inclination to stop, he was hailed, just as
                  he was passing, with,</p>
               <p>"Hallo, Jim! Where are you off to in such a hurry?"</p>
               <p>"Off to my work like an honest, sober man," Jim replied, pausing to return his
                  answer. "I've taken the pledge, my hearties, and what's more, I'm going to keep
                  it. It's all down in black and white, and my name's to it in the bargain,—so
                  there's an end of the matter, you see! Good bye, boys!—I'm sorry to leave you,—but
                  you must go my way if you want my company. Good bye, Harry! You've got the old
                  whiskey-barrel, and that's the last you'll ever get of mine. I never had any good
                  luck while it was in my house, and I am most heartily glad it's out, and in your
                  whiskey-shop, where I hope it will stay. Good bye, old cronies!"</p>
               <p>And so saying, Jim turned away, and walked off with a proud, erect bearing. His
                  old companions raised a feeble shout, but according to Jim's account, the laugh
                  was so much on the wrong side of their mouths, that it didn't seem to him anything
                  like a laugh.</p>
               <p>At eleven o'clock, Mr. Jones came out as usual, and said—</p>
               <p>"Well, Jim, I suppose you begin to feel a little like it was grog-time?"'</p>
               <p>"No, sir," Jim replied. "I'm done with grog."</p>
               <p>"Done with grog!" ejaculated Mr. Jones, in pleased surprise.</p>
               <p>"Why, you didn't seem at all afraid of it, yesterday?"</p>
               <p>"I did drink pretty hard, yesterday; but that was all your fault."</p>
               <p>"My fault! How do you make that out?"</p>
               <p>"Clear enough. Yesterday morning, seeing what a poor miserable wretch I had got to
                  be, and how much my wife and children were suffering, I swore of from ever
                  touching another drop. I wouldn't sign a pledge, though, because that, I thought,
                  would be giving up my freedom. In coming here, I got past Harry Arnold's grog-shop
                  pretty well, but when you came out so pleasantly at eleven o'clock, and asked me
                  to go over to the house and take a drink, I couldn't refuse for the life of
                  me—especially as I felt as dry as a bone. So I drank pretty freely, as you' know,
                  and went home, in consequence, drunk at night, notwithstanding I had promised
                  Sally, solemnly, in the morning, never to touch another drop again as long as I
                  lived. Poor soul! Bad enough, and discouraged enough, she felt last night, I
                  know.</p>
               <p>"So you see—when I got up this morning, I felt half-determined to sign the pledge,
                  at all hazards. Still I didn't want to give up my liberty, and was arguing the
                  points over again, when Sally took me right aback so strongly that I gave up,
                  wrote a pledge, signed it, and nailed it up over the mantelpiece, where it has got
                  to stay."</p>
               <p>"I am most heartily glad to hear of your good resolution," Mr. Jones said,
                  grasping warmly the hand of Braddock—"and heartily ashamed of myself for having
                  tempted you, yesterday. Hereafter, I am resolved not to offer liquor to any man
                  who works for me. If my money is not enough for him, he must go somewhere else.
                  Well," he continued—"you have signed away your liberty, as you called it. Do you
                  feel any more a slave than you did yesterday?"</p>
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC5627-00000161"/>
               <p>"A slave? No, indeed! I'm a free man now! Yesterday I was such a slave to a
                  debased appetite, that all my good resolutions were like cobwebs. Now I can act
                  like an honest, rational man. I am in a state of freedom. You ask me to drink. I
                  say 'no'—yesterday I could not say no, because I was not a free man. But now I am
                  free to choose what is right, and to reject what is wrong. I don't care for all
                  the grog-shops and whiskey-bottles from here to sun-down! I'm not afraid to go
                  past Harry Arnold's—nor even to go in there and make a temperance speech, if
                  necessary. Hurrah for freedom!"</p>
               <p>It cannot be supposed that Jim's wife, after her many sad disappointments, could
                  feel altogether assured that he would stand by his pledge, although she had more
                  confidence in its power over him than in anything else, and believed that it was
                  the only thing that would save him, if he could be saved at all. She was far more
                  cheerful, however, for her hope was stronger than it had ever been; and went about
                  her house with a far lighter step than usual.</p>
               <p>Towards evening, as the time began to approach for his return, she proceeded, as
                  she had done on the day before, to make arrangements for his comfortable
                  reception. The little scene of preparation for supper, and dressing up the
                  children, was all acted over again, and with a feeling of stronger confidence.
                  Still, her heart would beat at times oppressively, as a doubt would steal over her
                  mind.</p>
               <p>At last, the sun was just sinking behind a distant hill. It was the hour to expect
                  him. The children were gathered around her in the door, and her eyes were afar
                  off, eagerly watching to descry his well-known form in the distance. As minute
                  after minute passed away, and the sun at length went down below the horizon, her
                  heart began to tremble. Still, though she strained her eyes, she could see nothing
                  of him,—and now the twilight began to fall, dimly around, throwing upon her
                  oppressed heart a deeper shadow than that which mantled, like a thin veil, the
                  distant hills and valleys. With a heavy sigh, she was about returning into the
                  house, when a slight noise within caused her to turn quickly, and with a
                  start.</p>
               <p>"Back again, safe and sound, old girl!" greeted her glad ear, as the form of her
                  husband caught her eye, coming in at the back door.</p>
               <p>"O, Jim!" she exclaimed, her heart bounding with a wild, happy pulsation. "How
                  glad I am to see you!"</p>
               <p>And she flung herself into his arms, giving way, as she did so, to a gush of
                  joyful tears.</p>
               <p>"And I'm glad enough to see you, too, Sally! I've thought about you and the
                  children all day, and of how much I have wronged you. But it's all over now. That
                  pledge has done it!" pointing up as he spoke to his pledge nailed over the
                  mantelpiece. "Since I signed that, I've not had the first wish to touch the
                  accursed thing that has ruined me. I'm free, now, Sally! Free to do as I please.
                  And that's what I havn't been for a long time. As I told Mr. Jones, I don't care
                  now for all the grog-shops, whiskey-bottles, and Harry Arnolds, from here to
                  sun-down."</p>
               <p>"I told you it was all nonsense, Jim, about signing away your liberty!" Sally
                  said, smiling through her tears of joy.</p>
               <p>"Of course it was. I never was free before. But now I feel as free as air. I can
                  go in and come out and care no more for the sight of a grog-shop, than for a
                  hay-stack. I can take care of my wife and children, and be just as kind to them as
                  I please. And that's what I couldn't do before. Huzza for the pledge, say I!</p>
               <p>"Blister my feathers if ever I drink another drop of Alcohol, or anything that
                  will make drunk come, sick or well, dead or alive!"</p>
               <p>That evening Jim Braddock sat down to a good supper with a smiling wife, and three
                  children, all cleanly dressed, and looking as happy as they could be. The husband
                  and father had not felt so light a heart bounding in his bosom for years. He was
                  free,—and felt that he was free to act as reason dictated,—to work for and care
                  for his household treasures.</p>
               <p>Nearly a year has passed, and Mr. James Braddock has built himself a neat little
                  frame house, which is comfortably furnished, and has attached to it a
                  well-cultivated garden. In his parlour, there hangs, over the mantelpiece, his
                  original pledge, handsomely framed. Recently in writing to a friend, he says—</p>
               <p>"You will ask, where did I get them?" (his new house,<pb n="322-323"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000162"/> furniture, &amp;c.) "I'll tell you, boy. These are
                  part payment for my <emph>liberty</emph>, that I signed away. Didn't I sell it at
                  a bargain? But this is not all. I've got my shop back again, with a good run of
                  custom—am ten years younger than I was a year ago—have got the happiest wife and
                  the smartest boy in all creation—and don't care a snap for anybody! So now, S.
                  come down here; bring your wife, and all the <emph>responsibilities</emph>, and
                  I'll tell you the whole story—but I can't write. <emph>Hurrah for slavery!</emph>

               <p>"Nonsense! Say, what will you take?"</p>
               <p>"A glass of water. I don't drink anything stronger."</p>
               <p>"Not a teetotaller? Ha! ha! ha!" rejoined the young man's companion, laughing in
                  mingled mirth and ridicule.</p>
               <p>"Yes, a teetotaller, if you please," replied the one called Haley.—"Or anything
                  else you choose to denominate me."</p>
               <p>"You're a member of a temperance society, then? ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>"No, I am not."</p>
               <p>"Don't belong to the cold-water men?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Then come along and drink with me! Here, what will you take?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing at all, unless it be a glass of water. As I have just said, I drink
                  nothing stronger."</p>
               <p>"What's the reason?"</p>
               <p>"I feel as well—indeed, a great deal better without it."</p>
               <p>"That's all nonsense! Come, take a julep, or a brandy-punch with me."</p>
               <p>"No, Loring, I cannot."</p>
               <p>"I shall take it as an offence, if you do not."</p>
               <p>"I mean no offence, and shall be sorry, if you construe into one an act not so
                  intended. Drink if you wish to drink, but leave me in freedom to decline tasting
                  liquor if I choose."</p>
               <p>"Well, you are a strange kind of a genius, Haley—, but I believe I like you too
                  well to get mad with you, although I generally take a refusal to drink with one
                     as<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC5627-00000163"/> an insult, unless I know the
                  person to have joined a temperance society,—and then I should deem the insult on
                  my part, were I to urge him to violate his pledge. But I wonder you have never
                  joined yourself to some of these ultra reformers—these teetotallers, as they call
                  themselves."</p>
               <p>"I have never done so,—and never intend doing so. It is sufficient for me to
                  decline drinking, because I do not believe that stimulating beverages are good for
                  the body or mind. I act from principle in this matter, and, therefore, want no
                  external restraints."</p>
               <p>"Then you are determined not to drink with me?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes, I will drink with you."</p>
               <p>"Cold-water?"</p>
               <p>"Of course."</p>
               <p>"One julep, and a glass of Adam's-ale," said Loring, turning to the
                  bar-keeper.</p>
               <p>They were soon presented, glasses touched, heads bobbed, and the contents of the
                  two tumblers poured down their respective gullets.</p>
               <p>"It makes a chill go over me to see you drinking that stuff," Loring said, with an
                  expression of disgust on his face.</p>
               <p>"Every one to his taste, you know," was Haley's half-indifferent response.</p>
               <p>"You'll be over to-night, I suppose?" said a young man, stepping up to him, as the
                  two emerged from the "Coffee"-house—precious little coffee was ever seen
                  there.</p>
               <p>"O, yes,—of course."</p>
               <p>"You'd better not come."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Clara's got a bottle of champaign that she says she's going to make you taste
                  this very night."</p>
               <p>A slight shade flitted quickly over the face of Haley, as the young man said this.
                  But it was as quickly gone, and he replied with a smile,</p>
               <p>"Tell Clara it's no use. I'm an incorrigible cold-water man."</p>
               <p>"She'll be too much for you."</p>
               <p>"I'm not afraid."</p>
               <p>"You'd be, if you were as well acquainted with her as I am. I never knew that girl
                  to set her head about anything in my life that she didn't accomplish it. And she
                  says that she will make you drink a glass of wine with her, in spite of all your
                  opposition."</p>
               <p>"She'll find herself foiled once in her life," was the laughing reply; "and so you
                  may as well tell her that all her efforts will be in vain, and thus save further
                  trouble."</p>
               <p>"No, I won't, though. I'll tell her to go on, while I stand off and look at the
                  fun. I'll bet on her, into the bargain, for I know she'll beat."</p>
               <p>"So will I, two to one!" broke in Loring—</p>
               <p>"Don't be so certain of that."</p>
               <p>"We'll see," was the laughing response, and then the young men separated.</p>
               <p>Manley, the individual who had met Loring and Haley at the coffee-house door, was
                  the brother of Clara, and Haley was her accepted lover. The latter had removed to
                  the city in which all the parties resided, some two years before, from the east,
                  and had commenced business for himself. Nothing was known of his previous life, or
                  connections. But the pure gold of his character soon became apparent, and
                  guarantied him a reception into good society. All who came into association with
                  him, were impressed in his favour. Steadily, however, during that time, had he
                  persisted in not tasting any kind of stimulating drinks. All kinds of stimulating
                  condiments at table, were likewise avoided. The circle of acquaintances which had
                  gradually formed around him, or into which, rather, he had been introduced, was a
                  wine and brandy-drinking set of young men, and he was frequently urged to partake
                  with them; but neither persuasion, ridicule, nor pretended anger, could, in the
                  least, move him from his fixed resolution. Such scenes as that just presented,
                  were of frequent occurrence, particularly with recent acquaintances, as was the
                  case with Loring.</p>
               <p>Within a year he had been paying attention to Clara Manley, a happy-hearted young
                  creature, over whose head scarce eighteen bright summers had yet passed. Esteem
                  and admiration of her mind and person, had gradually changed into a pure and
                  permanent affection, which was tenderly and truly reciprocated.</p>
               <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC5627-00000164"/>
               <p>Wine, in the house of Mr. Manley, was used almost as freely as water. It was, with
                  brandy, an invariable accompaniment of the dinner-table, and no evening passed
                  without its being served around. Haley's refusal to touch it, was at first thought
                  singular by Clara; but she soon ceased to observe the omission, and the servant
                  soon learned in no case to present him the decanter. George Manley, however, could
                  not tolerate Haley's temperate habits, because he thought his abstinence a mere
                  whim, and bantered him upon it whenever occasion offered. At last, he aroused
                  Clara's mind into opposition, and incited her to make an effort to induce her
                  lover to drink.</p>
               <p>"What's the use of my doing it, brother?" she asked, when he first alluded to it.
                  "His not drinking does no harm to any one."</p>
               <p>"If it don't, it makes him appear very singular. No matter who is here—no matter
                  on what occasion, he must adhere to his foolish resolution. People will begin to
                  think, after awhile, that he's some reformed drunkard, and is afraid to taste a
                  drop of any kind of liquor."</p>
               <p>"How can you talk so, George?" Clara said, with a half-offended air.</p>
               <p>"So it will appear, Clara; and you can't help it, unless you laugh him out of his
                  folly."</p>
               <p>"I don't wish to say anything to him about it."</p>
               <p>"You're afraid."</p>
               <p>"No, I am not, George."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are."</p>
               <p>"What am I afraid of?"</p>
               <p>"Why, you're afraid that you won't succeed."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, then, and I am not. A mere notion like that I could easily prevail on him
                  to give up. I should be sorry, indeed, if I had not that much influence over
                  him."</p>
               <p>"You'll find it a pretty hard notion to beat out of him, I can tell you. I've seen
                  half a dozen young men try for an hour by all kinds of means to induce him to
                  taste wine; but it was no use. He was immovable."</p>
               <p>"I don't care;—he couldn't refuse me, if I set myself about it."</p>
               <p>"He could, and he would, Clara."</p>
               <p>"I don't believe a word of it."</p>
               <p>"Try him, then."</p>
               <p>"I don't see any use in it. Let him enjoy his total-abstinence! if he wishes
                  to."</p>
               <p>"I knew you were afraid."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I am not, then."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are."</p>
               <p>"It's no such thing."</p>
               <p>"Try him, then."</p>
               <p>"I will, then, since it's come to that."</p>
               <p>"He'll be too much for you."</p>
               <p>"Don't flatter yourself. I'll manage him."</p>
               <p>"How?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I'll insist on his taking a glass of that delightful champaign with me,
                  which you sent home yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Suppose he declines?"</p>
               <p>"I won't take his refusal. He shall take a glass with me."</p>
               <p>"We'll see, little sis'. I'll bet on Haley."—And so saying, the young man turned
                  away laughing at the success of his scheme.</p>
               <p>That evening, towards nine o'clock, as Haley sat conversing with Clara, a servant
                  entered the room as usual with bottles and glasses. George Manley was promptly on
                  his feet, to cut the cork and "pop" the champaign, which he did, while the servant
                  stood just before Clara and her lover.</p>
               <p>"You must take a glass of this fine champaign with me, Mr. Haley," the young
                  tempter said, turning upon him a most winning smile.,</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Clara—"</p>
               <p>"Not a word now. I shall take no refusal."</p>
               <p>"I must be—"</p>
               <p>"Pour him out a glass, George."</p>
               <p>And George filled two glasses, one of which Clara lifted, with the sparkling
                  liquor at the height of its effervescence.</p>
               <p>"There's the other; take it quick, before it dies," she said, holding her own
                  glass near her lips.</p>
               <p>"You must excuse me, Clara. I do not drink wine," Mr. Haley said, as soon as he
                  was permitted to speak, in<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC5627-00000165"/> a tone and
                  with a manner that settled the question at once.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, it is too bad, Mr. Haley!" Clara responded, with a half-offended air,
                  putting her untasted glass of wine back upon the waiter,—"to deny me so trifling a
                  request. I must say, that your refusal is very ungallant. Whoever heard of a
                  gentleman declining to take wine with a lady?"</p>
               <p>"There certainly is an exception to the rule to-night, Clara," the young man said.
                  "Still, I can assure you, that nothing ungallant was meant. But that you know to
                  be out of the question. I could not be rude to any lady, much less to you."</p>
               <p>"O, as to that, it's easy to make fine speeches—but acts, you know, speak louder
                  than words"—Clara said, half-laughing—half-serious.</p>
               <p>The servant had, by this time, passed on with the untasted wine; and, of course,
                  no further effort could be made towards driving the young man from his position.
                  His positive refusal to drink, however, under the circumstances, very naturally
                  disappointed Clara. He observed the sudden revulsion of feeling that took place in
                  her mind, and it pained him very much.</p>
               <p>As for her, she felt herself positively offended. She had set her heart upon
                  proving to her brother her power over Haley, but had signally failed in the
                  effort. He had proved to her immovable in his singular position.</p>
               <p>From that time, for many weeks, there was a coldness between him and Clara. She
                  did not receive him with her accustomed cordiality; but seemed both hurt and
                  offended. To take a simple glass of champaign with her was so small a request,
                  involving, as she reasoned, no violation of principle, that for him to refuse to
                  do so, under all the circumstances, was almost unpardonable.</p>
               <p>Affection, however, at last triumphed over wounded pride, but not until he had
                  begun, seriously, to debate the question of proposing to her a dissolution of the
                  contract existing between them.</p>
               <p>Everything again went on smoothly enough, for there was no further effort on the
                  part of Clara to drive her lover from his resolution. But she still entertained
                  the idea of doing so—and still resolved that she would conquer him.</p>
               <p>At last the wedding-day was set, and both looked forward to its approach with
                  feelings of pure delight. Their friends, without an exception, approved the match;
                  and well they might, for he was a man of known integrity, fine intellect, and
                  cultivated tastes; and she a young woman in every way fitted to unite with him in
                  marriage bonds.</p>
               <p>Finally came the long anticipated evening. Never before was there assembled in the
                  old mansion of Mr. Manley a happier company than that which had gathered to
                  witness the marriage of his daughter, whose young heart trembled in the fulness of
                  its delight, as she uttered the sealing words of her union with one who possessed
                  all her heart.</p>
               <p>"May kind heaven bless you, my child!" murmured the mother, as she pressed her
                  lips to those of her happy child.</p>
               <p>"And make your life glide on as peacefully as a quiet stream," added the father,
                  kissing her in turn, scarcely refraining, as he did so, from taking her in his
                  arms and folding her to his bosom.</p>
               <p>Then came crowding upon her the sincere congratulations of friends. O, how happy
                  she felt Joy seemed to have reached a climax. The cup was so full, that a drop
                  more would have overflowed the brim.</p>
               <p>A few minutes sufficed to restore again the order that had reigned through the
                  rooms, and the servants appeared with the bride's cake. All eyes were upon the
                  happy couple.</p>
               <p>"You won't refuse me <emph>now</emph>, James?" the bride said, in a low tone; but
                  with an appealing look, as she reached out her hand and lifted a glass of
                  wine.</p>
               <p>There was a hesitation in the manner of Haley, and Clara saw it. She knew that all
                  eyes were upon them, and she knew that all had observed her challenge. Her pride
                  was roused, and she could not bear the thought of being refused her first request
                  after marriage.</p>
               <p>"Take it, James, for my sake, even if you only place it to your lips without
                  tasting it," she said, in a low, hurried whisper.</p>
               <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC5627-00000166"/>
               <p>The young husband could not stand this. He took the glass, while the heart of
                  Clara bounded with an exulting throb. Of course, having gone thus far, he had to
                  go through the form of drinking with her. In doing so, he sipped but a few drops.
                  These thrilled on the nerve of taste with a sensation of exquisite pleasure.
                  Involuntarily he placed the glass to his lips again, and took a slight
                  draught.</p>
               <p>Then a sudden chill passed through his frame as consciousness returned, and he
                  would fain have dashed the glass from him as a poisoning serpent that was
                  preparing to sting him, but for the company that crowded the rooms. From this
                  state he was aroused by the sweet voice of his young wife, saying, in happy
                  tones—</p>
               <p>"So it has not poisoned you, James."</p>
               <p>He smiled an answer, but did not speak. The peculiar expression of that smile,
                  Clara remembered for many years afterwards.</p>
               <p>"Come! you must empty your glass with me," she said, in a moment after. "See! you
                  have scarcely tasted it yet. Now—"</p>
               <p>And she raised her glass, and he did the same. When he withdrew his own from his
                  lips, it was empty.</p>
               <p>"Bravo!"—exclaimed Clara, in a low, triumphant tone.</p>
               <p>"Now, isn't that delightful wine?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, very."</p>
               <p>"Did you ever taste wine before, James?" the bride laughingly said—</p>
               <p>"O, yes, many a time. But none so exquisitely flavoured as this."</p>
               <p>"Long abstinence has sweetened it to your taste."</p>
               <p>"No doubt."</p>
               <p>"Clara has been too much for you to-night, Haley," George Manley said, coming up
                  at this moment, and laughing in great glee.</p>
               <p>"He couldn't refuse me on such an occasion"—the bride gaily responded. "I set my
                  heart on making him drink wine with me on our wedding-night, and I have
                  succeeded."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure he hasn't poured it slyly upon the floor?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes! I saw him take every drop. And what is more; he smacked his lips, and
                  said it was exquisitely flavoured."</p>
               <p>"Here comes the servant again," George said, at this moment. "Come, James! let me
                  fill your glass again. You must drink with me to-night. You've never given me that
                  pleasure yet. Come!—As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb." Thus importuned, Haley
                  held up his glass which George Manley filled to the brim.</p>
               <p>"Health and happiness!" the young man said, bowing.</p>
               <p>Haley bowed in return, placed the glass to his lips, and took its contents at a
                  draught.</p>
               <p>"Bravely done! Why, it seems to go down quite naturally. You were not always a
                  total-abstinence man?"</p>
               <p>"No, I was not."—While a slight shadow flitted over his face.</p>
               <p>"Welcome back again, then, to a truly social, and convivial spirit! After this,
                  don't let me ever see you refuse a generous glass."</p>
               <p>"What! An empty wine-glass in the hand of young Mr. Incorrigible! Upon my word!"
                  ejaculated old Mr. Manley, coming up at this moment.</p>
               <p>"O, yes, pa! I've conquered him to-night! He couldn't refuse to take a glass of
                  wine with me on this occasion!" the daughter said, in great glee.</p>
               <p>"He must take one with me, too, then."</p>
               <p>"You must excuse me, indeed, sir," Haley replied—rallying himself, and bracing up
                  into firmness his broken and still wavering resolutions.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, then, and I won't."</p>
               <p>"O, no. Don't excuse him at all, pa! He drank with me, and then with brother, and
                  now to refuse to drink with you would be a downright shame."</p>
               <p>"He has taken a glass with George, too, has he? And now wants to be excused when I
                  ask him. Upon my word! Here, George, tell the servant to come over this way."</p>
               <p>The servant came, of course, in a moment or two, with the wine.</p>
               <p>"Fill up his glass, George," the father said.</p>
               <p>Haley's glass was, of course, filled again.</p>
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5627-00000167"/>
               <p>"Now, my boy!—Here's a health to my children! May this night's happiness be but as
                  a drop to the ocean of delight in reserve for them." Drinking.</p>
               <p>"And here's to our father! May his children never love him less than they do now."
                  Drinking in turn.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my boy!"</p>
               <p>"And thank you in return, for your kind wishes."</p>
               <p>"That wine didn't seem to taste unpleasantly, James?"</p>
               <p>"O, no, sir. It is rich and generous."</p>
               <p>"How long is it since you tasted wine?"</p>
               <p>"About three years."</p>
               <p>"Are you not fond of it?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes. I like a good glass of wine."</p>
               <p>"Then what in the world has made you act so singularly about it?"</p>
               <p>"A mere whim of mine, I suppose you will call it. And perhaps it was. I thought I
                  was just as well without it."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! Don't let me ever again hear of this foolishness."</p>
               <p>And then the old man mingled with the happy company.</p>
               <p>"Come, James, you must drink with me, too," the mother said, a little while
                  afterward.</p>
               <p>Haley did not seem unwilling, but turned off a glass of wine with an air of real
                  pleasure.</p>
               <p>"You must drink with me, too," went through the room. Every little while some one,
                  with whom the young man had on former occasions refused to drink, finding out that
                  he had been driven from his cold-water resolutions, insisted upon taking a glass
                  with him. Such being the case, it is not to be wondered at that a remark like this
                  should be made before the passage of an hour.</p>
               <p>"See! As I live, Haley's getting lively!"</p>
               <p>"I think that 'rich and generous wine' is beginning to brighten you up a little,"
                  Mr. Manley said, about this time, slapping his son-in-law familiarly upon the
                  shoulder?</p>
               <p>"I feel very happy, sir," was Haley's reply.</p>
               <p>"That's right. This is a happy occasion."</p>
               <p>"I never was so happy in my life! I hardly know what to do with myself. Come!
                  Won't you take some wine with me. I drank with you a little while ago."</p>
               <p>"Certainly! Certainly! My boy! Or, perhaps you would try a little brandy."</p>
               <p>"No objection," said the young man. And then the two went to the side-board, and
                  each took a stiff glass of brandy.</p>
               <p>"That's capital! It makes me feel good!" ejaculated Haley, as he set his empty
                  glass down.</p>
               <p>Cotillions were now formed, and the bride and groom took the floor in the first
                  set. Clara felt very proud of her husband as she leaned upon his arm, waiting for
                  the music to begin, and glanced around upon her maiden companions with a look of
                  triumph. But she soon had cause to abate her exultation, for when the music struck
                  up, and the dancers commenced their intricate movements, she found that her
                  husband blundered so as to throw all into confusion. The reason of this instantly
                  flashed upon her mind, for she knew him to be a correct and graceful dancer.
                     <emph>He was too much intoxicated to dance!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Her woman's pride caused her to make the effort to guide him through the figures.
                  But it was of no use. The second attempt failed signally by his breaking the
                  figures, and reeling with a loud, drunken laugh, through and through, and round
                  and round the astonished group of dancers, thrown thus suddenly into
                  confusion.</p>
               <p>Poor Clara, overwhelmed with mortification, retired to a seat, while her husband
                  continued his antics, ending them finally with an Indian whoop, such as may often
                  be heard late at night in the streets, from a company of drunken revellers,—when
                  he sought her out, and came and took a seat by her side.</p>
               <p>"Aint you happy to-night, Clara! Aint you, old girl!" he said, in a loud voice,
                  striking her with his open hand upon the shoulder. "I'm so happy that I feel just
                  ready to jump out of my skin! Whoop!—Now see how beautifully I can cut a
                  pigeon's-wing."</p>
               <p>And he sprang from his seat, and commenced describing the elegant figure he had
                  named, with industrious energy, much to the amusement of one portion of the
                  company, but to the painful mortification of another. A circle was soon formed
                  around him, to witness his graceful movements, which strongly reminded those
                     present<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5627-00000168"/> who had witnessed the
                  performances, of a corn-field negro's Juba, or the double-shuffle.</p>
               <p>"Come," old Mr. Manley said, interrupting the young man in his evolutions, by
                  laying his hand upon his arm.</p>
               <p>"Come! I want you a moment."</p>
               <p>"Hel-lel-lel-lo, o-o, there! What's wanting? ha!" he said, pausing, and then
                  staggering forwards against Mr Manley. "Who are you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"For shame, sir!" the old man replied in a stern voice. "Come with me, I wish to
                  speak to you."</p>
               <p>"Speak here, then, will you? I've no se-se-secrets. I'm open and above board! Jim
                  Haley's the boy that knows what he's about! Who-o-o-oop! Clear the track
                  there!"</p>
               <p>And starting away from the old man, he ran two or three paces, and then sprang
                  clear over the head of a young lady, frightening her almost out of her wits.</p>
               <p>"There! Who'll match me that? Jim Haley's the boy what's hard to beat!
                  Whoo-oo-oop, hurrah! But where's Clara? Where's my dear little wifie? Ah!
                  there—No, that isn't her, neither. Wh-wh-where is the little jade?"</p>
               <p>The whole of this passed in a few moments, with all the drunken gestures required
                  to give it the fullest effect.</p>
               <p>Poor Clara, at first mortified, when she saw what a perfect madman her husband had
                  become, was so shocked that her feelings overcame her, and she was carried
                  fainting from the room. O, how bitter was her momentary repentance of her blind
                  folly, ere her bewildered senses forsook her.</p>
               <p>As for Haley, he grew worse and worse, until the brandy which he continued to pour
                  down, had completely stupified him, when he was carried off to bed in a state of
                  drunken insensibility; after which, the company retired in oppressive and
                  embarrassed silence.</p>
               <p>Sad and lonely was the bridal chamber that night, and the couch of the young bride
                  was wet with bitter, but unavailing tears.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, those who first entered the room where Haley had slept, found
                  it empty. Towards the middle of the day, a letter was left for Clara by an unknown
                  hand. It ran thus:</p>
               <p>"DEAR CLARA—For you are still dear to me, although you have robbed me of happiness
                  for ever, and crushed your own hopes with mine. For years before I came to this
                  place, I had been a slave to intoxication—a slave held in a fearful bondage. At
                  last, I resolved to break loose from my thraldom. One vigorous effort, and I was
                  free. There yet remained to me a small remnant of a wrecked fortune. With this I
                  abandoned my early home, and fixed my residence here, determined once more to be a
                  man. Temptations beset me on every hand; but while I touched not, tasted not,
                  handled not, I knew that I was safe. But alas for the hour when you became my
                  tempter! O, that the remembrance of it could be blotted from my memory for ever!
                  When, for your sake, I raised that fatal glass to my lips, and the single drop of
                  wine that touched them thrilled wildly through every nerve, I felt that I was
                  lost. Horrible were my sensations, but your tempting voice lured me to sip the
                  scarcely tasted poison; I did so, and my resolution was gone! All that occurred
                  after that is only dimly written on my memory. But I was a madman. That I can
                  realize. When drunk, I have always acted the madman. And now we part for ever! I
                  am a proud man, and cannot remain in the scene of my disgrace. My property I leave
                  for you, and go I know not, and care not, whither—perhaps to die, unlamented, and
                  unknown, and sink into a drunkard's grave. Farewell!"</p>
               <p>This letter bore neither name nor date. But they were not needed.</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Five years from that sorrowful morning Clara sat by a window in her father's
                  house, near the close of day, looking dreamily up into the serene and cloudless
                  sky. Her face was pale, and had a look of hopeless suffering. Five years!—It
                  seemed as if twenty must have passed over her head, each burdening her with a
                  heavy weight of affliction. O, what a wreck did she present! Five years of such a
                  life! Who can tell their history? She was alone; and sat with her head upon her
                  hand, and her eyes fixed, as if upon some object. But, evidently, no image touched
                  the nerve of vision. Presently her lips moved, and a few mournful words were
                  uttered aloud, almost involuntarily.</p>
               <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC5627-00000169"/>
               <p>"O, that I knew where he was! O, that I could but find him, if alive!"</p>
               <p>A slight noise startled her, and she turned quickly. Was it a vision? Or did her
                  long-lost husband stand before her, the shadow of what he had been?</p>
               <p>"Clara! Dear Clara!"</p>
               <p>In a moment she was clinging to him with a trembling, eager, convulsive grasp.
                  Tenderly did he fold her in his arms, and press his lips to hers fervently.</p>
               <p>"Clara! Dear Clara!"</p>
               <p>"My own dear husband!" was all she could utter, as she sank like a helpless child
                  on his bosom.</p>
               <p>For four years from the night of his wedding, Haley had been a common drunkard,
                  with no power over himself. On the brink of the grave, he was rescued, signed a
                  pledge of total abstinence, and set himself eagerly to work to elevate his
                  condition. One year had sufficed to efface many sad tokens of his degradation, but
                  time could not restore the freshness to his cheek, nor the light to his eye. Then
                  he returned and sought his bride, who still mourned him with an inconsolable
                  grief. A few months produced a happy change in both. But they cannot look back.
                  Over the past they throw a veil,—the future is theirs, and it is growing brighter
                  and brighter. May its clear sky never be darkened!</p>

               <head>THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT.</head>
               <p>"Is there a good fire in the little spare room Jane?" said Mr. Wade, a plain
                  country farmer, coming into the kitchen where his good wife was busy preparing for
                  supper.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I've made the room as comfortable as can be," replied Mrs. Wade; "but I
                  wish you would take up a good armful of wood now, so that we wont have to disturb
                  Mr. N——, by going into the room after he gets here."</p>
               <p>"If he should come this evening," remarked the husband. "But it is getting late,
                  and I am afraid he won't be here Before the morning."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I guess he will be along soon. I have felt all day as if he were coming."</p>
               <p>"They say he is a good man, and preaches most powerfully. Mr. Jones heard him
                  preach in New York at the last conference, and tells me he never heard such a
                  sermon as he gave them. It cut right and left, and his words went home to every
                  heart like arrows of conviction."</p>
               <p>"I hope he will be here this evening," remarked the wife as she put some cakes in
                  the oven.</p>
               <p>"And so do I." remarked Mr. Wade, as he turned away, and went out to the wood pile
                  for an armfull of wood for the expected minister's room.</p>
               <p>It was Saturday afternoon, and nearly sundown. Mr. N——, who was expected to
                  arrive, and for whose comfort every preparation in their power to make, had been
                  completed by the family at whose house he was to stay, was the new Presiding Elder
                  of B—— District, in the New Jersey Conference. Quarterly meeting was to be held on
                  the next day, which was Sunday, when Mr. N—— was to preach, and administer the
                  ordinances of the church. Being his first visit to that part of the District, the
                  preacher was known to but few, if any, of the members, and they all<pb n="338-339"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000170"/> looked forward to his arrival with interest, and
                  were prepared to welcome him with respect and affection.</p>
               <p>The house of Mr. Wade was known as the 'minister's home.' For years, in their
                  movements through the circuit, the preachers, as they came round to this part in
                  the field of their appointed labor, were welcomed by Brother and Sister Wade, and
                  the little spare chamber made comfort. able for their reception. It was felt by
                  these honest-hearted people, more a privilege than a duty, thus to share their
                  temporal blessings with the men of God who ministered to them in holy things. They
                  had their weaknesses, as we all have. One of their weaknesses consisted in a firm
                  belief that they were deeply imbued with the genuine religion, and regarded things
                  spiritual above all worldly considerations. They were kind, good people,
                  certainly, but not as deeply read in the lore of their own hearts, not as familiar
                  with the secret springs of their own actions, as all of us should desire to be.
                  But this was hardly to be wondered at, seeing that their position in the church
                  was rather elevated as compared with those around them, and they were the subjects
                  of little distinguishing marks flattering to the natural man.</p>
               <p>While Mr. Wade was splitting a log at the wood-pile, his thoughts on the new
                  Presiding Elder, and his feelings warm with the anticipated pleasure of meeting
                  and entertaining him, a man of common appearance approached along the road, and
                  when he came to where the farmer was, stood still and looked at him until he had
                  finished cutting the log, and was preparing to lift the cleft pieces in his
                  arms.</p>
               <p>"Rather a cold day this," said the man.</p>
               <p>"Yes, rather," returned Mr. Wade, a little indifferently, and in a voice meant to
                  repulse the stranger, whose appearance did not impress him very favorably.</p>
               <p>"How far is it to D——?" inquired the man.</p>
               <p>"Three miles," replied Mr. Wade, who having filled his arms with wood, was
                  beginning to move off towards the house.</p>
               <p>"So far!" said the man in a tone that was slightly marked with hesitation. "I
                  thought it was but a little way from this." Then with an air of hesitation, and
                  speaking in a respectful voice, he added, "I would feel obliged if you would let
                  me go in and warm myself. I have walked for two miles in the cold, an— as D—— is
                  still three miles off, I shall be chilled through before I get there."</p>
               <p>So modest and natural a request as this, Mr. Wade could not refuse, and yet, in
                  the way he said—"Oh, certainly"—there was a manner that clearly betrayed his wish
                  that the man had passed on and preferred his request somewhere else. Whether this
                  was noticed or not, is of no consequence; the wayfarer on this assent to his
                  request, followed Mr. Wade into the house.</p>
               <p>"Jane," said the farmer as he entered the house with the stranger, and his voice
                  was not as cordial as it might have been; "let this man warm himself by the
                  kitchen fire. He has to go all the way to D—— this evening and says he is
                  cold."</p>
               <p>There is a kind of magnetic intelligence in the tones of the voice. Mrs. Wade
                  understood perfectly, by the way in which this was said, that the husband did not
                  feel much sympathy for the stranger, and only yielded the favor asked because he
                  could not well refuse to grant it. Her own observation did not correct the
                  impression her husband's manner had produced. The man's dress, though neither
                  dirty nor ragged, was not calculated to impress any one very favorably. His hat
                  was much worn, and the old gray coat in which he was buttoned up to the chin, had
                  seen so much service that it was literally threadbare from collar to skirt, and
                  showed numerous patches, darns, and other evidences of needlework, applied long
                  since to its original manufacture. His cow-hide boots, though whole, had a coarse
                  look; and his long dark beard gave his face, not a very prepossessing one at best,
                  a no very attractive aspect.</p>
               <p>"You can sit down there," said Mrs. Wade, a little ungraciously, for she felt the
                  presence of the man, just at that particular juncture, as an intrusion; and she
                  pointed to an old chair that stood. near the fire-place, in front of which was a
                  large Dutch oven containing some of her best cream short cakes, prepared
                  especially for Mr. N——, the new Presiding Elder now momently expected.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Ma'am," returned the stranger, as he took<pb n="340-341"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000171"/> the chair, and drew close up to the blazing hearth,
                  and removing his thick woolen gloves, spread his hands to receive the genial
                  warmth.</p>
               <p>Nothing more was said by either the stranger or Mr. Wade, for the space of three
                  or four minutes. During this time, the good house-wife passed in and out, once or
                  twice, busy as could be in looking after supper affairs. The lid of the ample
                  Dutch oven had been raised once or twice, and both the eyes and nose of the
                  traveller greeted with a pleasant token of the good fare soon to be served up in
                  the family. He was no longer cold; but the sight and smell of the cakes and other
                  good things in preparation by the lady, awakened a sense of hunger, and made it
                  keenly felt. But, as the comfort of a little warmth had been bestowed so
                  reluctantly, he could not think of trespassing on the farmer and his wife for a
                  bite of supper, and so commenced drawing on his heavy woolen gloves, and buttoning
                  up his old gray coat. While occupied in doing this, Mr. Wade came into the
                  kitchen, and said—</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid Jane, that the minister won't be along this evening. It's after
                  sun-down, and begins to grow duskish."</p>
               <p>"He ought to have been here an hour ago," returned Mrs. W., in a tone of
                  disappointment.</p>
               <p>"It's getting late, my friend, and D——'s a good distance ahead," remarked the
                  farmer, after standing with his back to the fire, and regarding for some moments
                  the stranger, who had taken off his gloves, and was slowly unbuttoning his coat
                  again.</p>
               <p>"It's three miles you say?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, good three miles, if not more; and it will be dark in half an hour."</p>
               <p>"What direction must I take?" required the stranger.</p>
               <p>"You keep along the road until you come to the meeting house on the top of the
                  hill, half a mile beyond this, and then you strike off to the right, and keep
                  straight on."</p>
               <p>"What meeting house is it?"</p>
               <p>"The D—— Methodist Meeting House."</p>
               <p>"You are expecting the minister, I think you just now said?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Mr. N——, our new Presiding Elder, is to preach to-morrow, and he was to have
                  been here this afternoon."</p>
               <p>"He is to stay with you?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly he is. The ministers all stay at my house."</p>
               <p>The man got up, and went to the door and looked out.</p>
               <p>"Couldn't you give me a little something to eat before I go," he said, returning.
                  "I havn't tasted food since this morning, and feel a little faint."</p>
               <p>"Jane, can't you give him some cold meat and bread?" Mr. Wade turned to his wife,
                  and she answered, just a little fretfully, "Oh, yes, I suppose so;" and going to
                  the cupboard, brought out a dish containing a piece of cold fat bacon that had
                  been boiled with cabbage for dinner, and half a loaf of bread, which she placed on
                  the kitchen table and told the man to help himself. The stranger did not wait for
                  another invitation; but set to work in good earnest upon the bread and bacon,
                  while the farmer stood with his hands behind him, and his back to the fire,
                  whistling the air of "Auld Lang Syne," while he mentally repeated the words of the
                  hymn of "When I can read my title clear," and wished that his visitor would make
                  haste and get through with his supper. The latter, after eating for a short time
                  with the air of a man whose appetite was keen, began to discuss the meat and bread
                  with more deliberation, and occasionally to ask a question, or make a remark, the
                  replies to which were not very gracious, although Mr. Wade forced himself to be as
                  polite as he could be.</p>
               <p>The homely meal at length concluded, the man buttoned up his old coat and drew on
                  his coarse woolen gloves again, and thanking Mr. and Mrs. Wade for their
                  hospitality, opened the door and looked out. It was quite dark, for there was no
                  moon, and the sky was veiled in clouds. The wind rushed into his face, cold and
                  piercing. For a moment or two, he stood with his hand upon the door, and then
                  closing it he turned back into the house, and said to the farmer</p>
               <p>"You say it is still three miles to D——?"</p>
               <p>"I do," said Mr. Wade coldly.</p>
               <p>"I said so to you when you first stopped, and you ought to have pushed on<pb
                     n="342-343" xml:id="VAC5627-00000172"/> like a prudent man. You could have
                  reached there before it was quite dark."</p>
               <p>"But I was cold and hungry, and might have fainted by the way."</p>
               <p>The manner of saying this touched the farmer's feelings a little, and caused him
                  to look more narrowly into the stranger's face than he had yet done. But he saw
                  nothing more than he had already seen.</p>
               <p>"You have warmed and fed me, for which I am thankful. Will you not bestow another
                  act of kindness upon one who is in a strange place, and if he goes out in the
                  darkness may lose himself and perish in the cold?"</p>
               <p>The peculiar form in which this request was made, and the tone in which it was
                  uttered, put it almost out of the power of the farmer to say no.</p>
               <p>"Go in there and sit down," he <choice>
                     <sic>answed</sic>
                     <corr>answered</corr>
                  </choice>, pointing to the kitchen, "and I will see my wife, and hear what she has
                  to say."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Wade went into the parlor where the supper table stood, covered with a
                  snow-white cloth, and displaying his wife's set of bluesprigged china, that was
                  only brought out on special occasions. Two tall mould candles were burning
                  thereon, and on the hearth blazed a cheerful hickory fire.</p>
               <p>"Hasn't that old fellow gone yet?" asked Mrs. Wade. She had heard his voice as he
                  returned from the door.</p>
               <p>"No. And what do you suppose? He wants us to let him stay all night."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, and we'll do no such thing! We can't have the likes of him in the house,
                  no how. Where could he sleep?"</p>
               <p>"Not in the best room, even if Mr. N—— shouldn't come."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed!"</p>
               <p>"But I really don't see, Jane how we can turn him out of doors. He doesn't look
                  like a very strong man, and it's dark and cold, and full three miles to D——."</p>
               <p>"It's too much! He ought to have gone on while he had daylight, and not lingered
                  here as he did until it got dark."</p>
               <p>"We can't turn him out of doors, Jane; and it's no use to think of it. He'll have
                  to stay now."</p>
               <p>"But what can we do with him?"</p>
               <p>"He seems like a decent man, at least; and don't look as if he had anything bad
                  about him. We might make him a bed on the floor somewhere."</p>
               <p>"I wish he had been to Guinea before he came here," said Mrs. Wade, fretfully. The
                  disappointment, the conviction that Mr. N—— would not arrive, and the intrusion of
                  so unwelcome a visitor as the stranger, completely unhinged her mind.</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, Jane," replied her husband in a soothing voice, "never mind. We must
                  make the best of it. Poor man! He came to us tired and hungry, and we have warmed
                  him and fed him. He now asks shelter for the night, and we must not refuse him,
                  nor grant his request in a complaining reluctant spirit. You know what the Bible
                  says about entertaining angels unawares."</p>
               <p>"Angels! Did you ever see an angel look like him?"</p>
               <p>"Having never seen an angel," said the husband smiling, "I am unable to speak as
                  to their appearance."</p>
               <p>This had the effect to call an answering smile to the face of Mrs. Wade, and a
                  better feeling to her heart. And it was finally agreed between them, that the man,
                  as he seemed like a decent kind of a person, should be permitted to occupy the
                  minister's room, if that individual did not arrive, an event to which they both
                  now looked with but small expectancy. If he did come, why the man would have put
                  up with poorer accommodations.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Wade returned to the kitchen where the stranger had seated himself before
                  the fire, he informed him, that they had decided to let him stay all night. The
                  man expressed in a few words his grateful sense of their kindness, and then became
                  silent and thoughtful. Soon after, the farmer's wife, giving up all hopes of Mr.
                  N——'s arrival, had supper taken up, which consisted of coffee, warm cream short
                  cakes, and sweet cakes, broiled ham, and broiled chicken. After all was on the
                  table, a short conference was held, as to whether it would do not to invite the
                  stranger to take supper. It was true, they had given him as much bread and bacon
                  as he could eat; but<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC5627-00000173"/> then, as long as
                  he was going to stay all night, it looked too inhospitable to sit down to the
                  table and not ask him to join them. So, making a virtue of necessity, he was
                  kindly asked to come in to supper, an invitation which he did not decline. Grace
                  was said over the meal by Mr. Wade, and then the coffee was poured out, the bread
                  helped, and the meat served.</p>
               <p>There was a fine little boy of some five or six years old at the table, who had
                  been brightened up, and dressed in his best, in order to grace the minister's
                  reception. Charley was full of talk, and the parents felt a natural pride in
                  showing him off, even before their humble guest, who noticed him particularly,
                  although he had not much to say.</p>
               <p>"Come, Charley," said Mr. Wade, after the meal was over, and he sat leaning back
                  in his chair, "can't you repeat the pretty hymn mamma learned you last
                  Sunday?"</p>
               <p>Charley started off, without further invitation, and repeated, very accurately,
                  two or three verses of a new camp-meeting hymn, that was just then very
                  popular.</p>
               <p>"Now let us hear you say the Commandments, Charley," spoke up the mother, well
                  pleased at her child's performance. And Charley repeated them with only the aid of
                  a little prompting.</p>
               <p>"How many commandments are there?" asked the father.</p>
               <p>The child hesitated, and then looking up at the stranger, near whom he sat, said,
                  innocently,—</p>
               <p>"How many are there?"</p>
               <p>The man thought for some moments, and said, as if in doubt—</p>
               <p>"Eleven, are there not?"</p>
               <p>"Eleven!" ejaculated Mrs. Wade, looking towards the man in unfeigned surprise.</p>
               <p>"Eleven!" said her husband, with more of rebuke than astonishment in his voice.
                  "Is it possible, sir, that you do not know how many Commandments there are? How
                  many are there, Charley? Come! Tell me; you know, of course."</p>
               <p>"Ten," said the child.</p>
               <p>"Right, my son," returned Mr. Wade, with a smile of approval.</p>
               <p>"Right. Why, there isn't a child of his age within ten miles who can't tell you
                  that there are ten Commandments. "Did you never read the Bible, sir?" addressing
                  the stranger.</p>
               <p>"When I was a little boy, I used to read in it sometimes. But I'm sure I thought
                  there were eleven Commandments. Are you not mistaken about there being only
                  ten?"</p>
               <p>Sister Wade lifted her hands in unfeigned astonishment, and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Could any one believe it? Such ignorance of the Bible!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Wade did not reply, but he arose, and going to one corner of the room, where
                  the Good Book lay upon a small mahogany stand, brought it to the table, and
                  pushing away his plate, cup and saucer, laid the volume before him, and opened
                  that portion in which the Commandments are recorded.</p>
               <p>"There!" he said, placing his finger upon a proof of the man's error. "There! Look
                  for yourself!"</p>
               <p>The man came round from his side of the table, and looked over the farmer's
                  shoulder.</p>
               <p>"There! Ten;—d'ye see!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it does say ten," replied the man. "And yet it seems to me there are eleven.
                  I'm sure I have always thought so."</p>
               <p>"Doesn't it say ten, here?" inquired Mr. Wade, with marked impatience in his
                  voice.</p>
               <p>"It does certainly."</p>
               <p>"Well, what more do you want? Can't you believe the Bible?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes I believe in the Bible, and yet, somehow, it strikes me that there must
                  be eleven Commandments. Hasn't one been added somewhere else?"</p>
               <p>Now this was too much for Brother and Sister Wade to bear. Such ignorance on
                  sacred matters they felt to be unpardonable. A long lecture followed, in which the
                  man was scolded, admonished and threatened with Divine indignation. At its close,
                  he modestly asked if he might have the Bible to read for an hour or two, before
                  retiring to rest. This request was granted with more pleasure than any of the
                  preceding ones. Shortly after supper the<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC5627-00000174"
                  /> man was conducted to the little spare room accompanied by the Bible. Before
                  leaving him alone, Mr. Wade felt it his duty to exhort him on spiritual things,
                  and he did so most earnestly for ten or fifteen minutes. But he could not see that
                  his words made much impression, and he finally left his guest, lamenting his
                  ignorance and obduracy.</p>
               <p>In the morning, the man came down, and meeting Mr. Wade, asked him if he would be
                  so kind as to lend him a razor, that he might remove his beard, which did not give
                  his face a very attractive aspect. His request was complied with.</p>
               <p>"We will have family prayer in about ten minutes," said Mr. Wade, as he handed him
                  a razor and a shaving-box.</p>
               <p>In ten minutes the man appeared and behaved himself with due propriety at family
                  worship. After breakfast he thanked the farmer and his wife for their hospitality,
                  and departing, went on his journey.</p>
               <p>Ten o'clock came, and Mr. N—— had not yet arrived. So Mr. and Mrs. Wade started
                  off for the meeting house, not doubting that they would find him there. But they
                  were disappointed. A goodly number of people were inside the meeting house, and a
                  goodly number outside, but the minister had not yet arrived.</p>
               <p>"Where is Mr. N——?" inquired a dozen voices, as a little crowd gathered around the
                  farmer.</p>
               <p>"He hasn't come yet. Something has detained him. But I still look for him; indeed,
                  I fully expected to find him here."</p>
               <p>The day was cold, and Mr. Wade, after becoming thoroughly chilled, concluded to go
                  in, and keep a look-out for the minister from the window near which he usually
                  sat. Others, from the same cause, followed his example, and the little meeting
                  house was soon filled, and still one after another came dropping in. The farmer,
                  who turned towards the door each time it opened, was a little surprised to see his
                  guest of the previous night enter, and come slowly along the aisle, looking from
                  side to side as if in search of a vacant seat, very few of which were now left.
                  Still advancing, he finally passed within the little enclosed altar, and ascending
                  to the pulpit, took off his old gray overcoat and sat down.</p>
               <p>By this time Mr. Wade was by his side, and with his hand upon his arm.</p>
               <p>"You mustn't sit here. Come down, and I'll show you a seat," he said in an excited
                  tone.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," returned the man, in a composed tone. "It is very comfortable
                  here."</p>
               <p>"But you are in the pulpit! You are in the pulpit, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, never mind. It is very comfortable here." And the man remained immovable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wade, feeling much embarrassed, turned away, and went down, intending to get a
                  brother official in the church to assist him in making a forcible ejection of the
                  man from the place he was desecrating. Immediately upon his doing so, however, the
                  man arose, and standing up at the desk, opened the hymn book. His voice thrilled
                  to the very finger ends of Brother Wade, as, in a distinct and impressive manner,
                  he gave out the hymn beginning— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Help us to help each other, Lord,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Each other's cross to bear;</l>
                        <l>Let each his friendly aid afford,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And feel a brother's care."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The congregation arose after the stranger had read the entire hymn, and he then
                  repeated the two first lines for them to sing. Brother Wade usually started the
                  tune. He tried it this time, but went off on a long metre tune. Discovering his
                  mistake at the second word, he balked, and tried it again, but now he stumbled on
                  short metre. A musical brother here came to his aid, and let off with an air that
                  suited the measure in which the hymn was written. After the singing, the
                  congregation kneeled, and the minister, for no one now doubted his real character,
                  addressed the Throne of Grace with much fervor and eloquence. The reading of a
                  chapter from the Bible succeeded to these exercises. Then there was a deep pause
                  throughout the room in anticipation of the text, which the preacher prepared to
                  announce.</p>
               <p>Brother Wade looked pale, and his hands and knees trembled;—Sister Wade's face was
                  like crimson, and her<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC5627-00000175"/> heart was beating
                  so loud that she wondered whether the sound was not heard by the sister who sat
                  beside her. There was a breathless silence. The dropping of a pin might almost
                  have been heard. Then the fine, emphatic tones of the preacher filled the crowded
                  room.</p>
               <p>"<emph>A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another</emph>."</p>
               <p>Brother Wade had bent to listen, but he now sank back in his seat. This was the
                  ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT!</p>
               <p>The sermon was deeply searching, yet affectionate and impressive. The preacher
                  uttered nothing that could in the least wound, the brother and sister of whose
                  hospitality he had partaken, but he said much that smote upon their hearts, and
                  made them painfully conscious that they had not shown as much kindness to the
                  stranger as he had been entitled to receive on the broad principles of humanity.
                  But they suffered most from mortification of feeling. To think that they should
                  have treated the Presiding Elder of the District after such a fashion, was deeply
                  humiliating; and the idea of the whole affair getting abroad, interfered sadly
                  with their devotional feelings throughout the whole period of the service.</p>
               <p>At last the sermon was over, the ordinance administered, and the benediction
                  pronounced. Brother Wade did not know what it was best for him now to-do. He never
                  was more at a loss in his life. Mr. N—— descended from the pulpit, but he did not
                  step forward to meet him. How could he do that? Others gathered around and shook
                  hands with him, but he still lingered and held back.</p>
               <p>"Where is Brother Wade?" he at length heard asked. It was in the voice of the
                  minister.</p>
               <p>"Here he is," said two or three, opening the way to where the farmer stood.</p>
               <p>The preacher advanced, and extending his hand, said—</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Brother Wade? I am glad to see you. And where is Sister Wade?"</p>
               <p>Sister Wade was brought forward, and the preacher shook hands with them heartily,
                  while his face was lit up with smiles.</p>
               <p>"I believe I am to find my home with you?" he said, as if that were a matter
                  understood and settled.</p>
               <p>Before the still embarrassed brother and sister could reply, some one asked—</p>
               <p>"How came you to be detained so late? You were expected last night. And where is
                  Brother R——?"</p>
               <p>"Brother R—— is sick," replied Mr. N——, "and so I had to come alone. Five miles
                  from this my horse gave out, and I had to come the rest of the way on foot. But I
                  became so cold and weary that I found it necessary to ask a farmer not far away
                  from here to give me a night's lodging, which he was kind enough to do. I thought
                  I was still three miles off, but it happened that I was much nearer my journey's
                  end than I had supposed."</p>
               <p>This explanation was satisfactory to all parties, and in due time the congregation
                  dispersed; and the Presiding Elder went home with Brother and Sister Wade. How the
                  matter was settled between them, we do not know. One thing is certain,
                  however,—the story which we have related did not get out for some years after the
                  worthy brother and sister had rested from their labors, and it was then related by
                  Mr. N—— himself, who was rather <choice>

                  a good joke, and given to relating good stories.</p>

               <head>THE IRON WILL.</head>
               <p>"FANNY! I've but one word more to say on the subject. If you marry that fellow,
                  I'll have nothing to do with you. I've said it; and you may be assured that I'll
                  adhere to my determination."</p>
               <p>Thus spoke, with a frowning brow and a stern voice, the father of Fanny Crawford,
                  while the maiden sat with eyes bent upon the floor.</p>
               <p>"He's a worthless, good-for-nothing fellow," resumed the father; "And if you marry
                  him, you wed a life of misery. Don't come back to me, for I will disown you the
                  day you take his name. I've said it, and my decision is unalterable."</p>
               <p>Still Fanny made no answer, but sat like a statue.</p>
               <p>"Lay to heart what I have said, and make your election, girl." And with these
                  words, Mr. Crawford retired from the presence of his daughter.</p>
               <p>On that evening Fanny Crawford left her father's house, and was secretly married
                  to a young man named Logan, whom, spite of all his faults, she tenderly loved.</p>
               <p>When this fact became known to Mr. Crawford, he angrily repeated his threat of
                  utterly disowning his child; and he meant what he said—for he was a man of stern
                  purpose and unbending will. When trusting to the love she believed him to bear for
                  her, Fanny ventured home, she was rudely repulsed, and told that she no longer had
                  a father. These cruel words fell upon her heart and ever after rested there, an
                  oppressive weight.</p>
               <p>Logan was a young mechanic, with a good trade and the ability to earn a
                  comfortable living. But Mr. Crawford's objection to him was well founded, and it
                  would have been better for Fanny if she had permitted it to influence her; for the
                  young man was idle in his habits, and Mr. Crawford too clearly saw that idleness
                  would lead to dissipation. The father had hoped that his threat to disown his
                  child would have deterred her from taking the step he so strongly disapproved. He
                  had, in fact, made this threat as a last effort to save her from a union that
                  would, inevitably, lead to unhappiness. But having made it, his stubborn and
                  offended pride caused him to adhere with stern inflexibility to his word.</p>
               <p>When Fanny went from under her father's roof, the old man was left alone. The
                  mother of his only child had been many years dead. For her father's sake, as well
                  as for her own, did Fanny wish to return. She loved her parents with a most
                  earnest affection, and thought of him as sitting gloomy and companionless in that
                  home so long made light and cheerful by her voice and smile. Hours and hours would
                  she lie awake at night, thinking of her father, and weeping for the estrangement
                  of his heart from her. Still there was in her bosom an ever living hope that he
                  would relent. And to this she clung, though he passed her in the street without
                  looking at her, and steadily denied her admission, when, in the hope of some
                  change in his stern purpose, she would go to his house and seek to gain an
                  entrance.</p>
               <p>As the father had predicted, Logan added, in the course of a year or two,
                  dissipation to idle habits and neglect of his wife to both. They had gone to
                  housekeeping in a small way, when first married, and had lived comfortably enough
                  for some time. But Logan did not like work, and made every excuse he could find to
                  take a holiday, or be absent from the shop. The effect of this was, an
                  insufficient income. Debt came with its mortifying and <choice>
                     <sic>harrassing</sic>
                     <corr>harassing</corr>
                  </choice> accompaniments, and furniture had to be sold to pay those who were not
                  disposed to wait. With two little children, Fanny was removed by her husband into
                  a cheap boarding-house, after their things were taken and sold. The company into
                  which she was here thrown, was far from being agreeable; but this would have been
                  no source of unhappiness in itself. Cheerfully would she have breathed the
                  uncongenial atmosphere, if there had been nothing in the conduct of her husband to
                  awaken feelings of anxiety. But, alas! there was much to create unhappiness here.
                  Idle days were more frequent; and the consequences<pb n="352-353"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000177"/> quences of idle days more and more serious. From
                  his work, he would come home sober and cheerful; but after spending a day in idle
                  company, or in the woods gunning, a sport of which he was fond, he would meet his
                  wife with a sullen, dissatisfied aspect, and, too often, in a state little above
                  intoxication.</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid thy son-in-law is not doing very well, friend Crawford," said a
                  plain-spoken Quaker to the father of Mrs. Logan, after the young man's habits
                  began to show themselves too plainly in his appearance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Crawford knit his brows, and drew his lips closely together.</p>
               <p>"Has thee seen young Logan lately?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know the young man," replied Mr. Crawford, with an impatient motion of
                  his head.</p>
               <p>"Don't know thy own son-in-law! The husband of thy daughter!"</p>
               <p>"I have no son-in-law! No daughter!" said Crawford, with stern emphasis.</p>
               <p>"Frances was the daughter of thy wedded wife, friend Crawford."</p>
               <p>"But I have disowned her. I forewarned her of the consequences if she married that
                  young man. I told her that I would cast her off for ever; and I have done it."</p>
               <p>"But, friend Crawford, thee has done wrong."</p>
               <p>"I've said it, and I'll stick to it."</p>
               <p>"But thee has done wrong, friend Crawford," repeated the Quaker.</p>
               <p>"Right or wrong, it is done, and I will not recall the act. I gave her fair
                  warning; but she took her own course, and now she must abide the consequences.
                  When I say a thing, I mean it; I never eat my words."</p>
               <p>"Friend Crawford," said the Quaker, in a steady voice and with his calm eyes fixed
                  upon the face of the man he addressed. "Thee was wrong to say what thee did. Thee
                  had no right to cast off thy child. I saw her to-day, passing slowly along the
                  street. Her dress was thin and faded; but not so thin and faded as her pale, young
                  face. Ah! if thee could have seen the sadness of that countenance. Friend
                  Crawford! she is thy child still. Thee cannot disown her."</p>
               <p>"I never change," replied the resolute father.</p>
               <p>"She is the child of thy beloved wife, now in heaven, friend Crawford."</p>
               <p>"Good morning!" and Crawford turned and walked away.</p>
               <p>"Rash words are bad enough," said the Quaker to himself, "but how much worse is it
                  to abide by rash words, after there has been time for reflection and
                  repentance!"</p>
               <p>Crawford was troubled by what the Quaker said; but more troubled by what he saw a
                  few minutes afterwards, as he walked along the street, in the person of his
                  daughter's husband. He met the young man, supported by two others—so much
                  intoxicated that he could not stand alone. And in this state he was going home to
                  his wife—to Fanny!</p>
               <p>The father clenched his hands, set his teeth firmly together, muttered an
                  imprecation upon the head of Logan, and quickened his pace homeward. Try as he
                  would, he could not shut out from his mind the pale, faded countenance of his
                  child, as described by the Quaker, nor help feeling an inward shudder at the
                  thought of what she must suffer on meeting her husband in such a state.</p>
               <p>"She has only herself to blame," he said, as he struggled with his feelings. "I
                  forewarned her; I gave her to understand clearly what she had to expect. My word
                  is passed. I have said it; and that ends the matter. I am no childish trifler.
                  What I say, I mean."</p>
               <p>Logan had been from home all day, and, what was worse, had not been, as his wife
                  was well aware, at the shop for a week. The woman with whom they were boarding,
                  came into her room during the afternoon, and, after some hesitation and
                  embarrassment, said—</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to tell you, Mrs. Logan that I shall want you to give up your room,
                  after this week. You know I have had no money from you for nearly a month, and,
                  from the way your husband goes on, I see little prospect of being paid any thing
                  more. If I was able, for your sake, I would not say a word. But I am not, Mrs.
                  Logan, and therefore must, in justice to myself and family, require you to get
                  another boarding-house."</p>
               <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC5627-00000178"/>
               <p>Mrs. Logan answered only with tears. The woman tried to soften what she had said,
                  and then went away.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, Logan came stumbling up the stairs, and opening the door of
                  his room, staggered in and threw himself heavily upon the bed. Fanny looked at him
                  a few moments, and then crouching down, and covering her face with her hands, wept
                  long and bitterly. She felt crushed and powerless. Cast off by her father, wronged
                  by her husband, destitute and about to be thrust from the poor home into which she
                  had shrunk: faint and weary, it seemed as if hope were gone forever. While she
                  suffered thus, Logan lay in a drunken sleep. Arousing herself at last, she removed
                  his boots and coat, drew a pillow under his head, and threw a coverlet over him.
                  She then sat down and wept again. The tea bell rung, but she did not go to the
                  table. Half an hour afterwards, the landlady came to the door and kindly inquired
                  if she would not have some food sent up to her room.</p>
               <p>"Only a little bread and milk for Henry," was replied.</p>
               <p>"Let me send you a cup of tea," urged the woman.</p>
               <p>"No, thank you. I don't wish any thing to night."</p>
               <p>The woman went away, feeling troubled. From her heart she pitied the suffering
                  young creature, and it had cost her a painful struggle to do what she had done.
                  But the pressing nature of her own circumstances required her to be rigidly just.
                  Notwithstanding Mrs. Logan had declined having any thing, she sent her a cup of
                  tea and something to eat. But they remained untasted.</p>
               <p>On the next morning Logan was sober, and his wife informed him of the notice which
                  their landlady had given. He was angry, and used harsh language towards the woman.
                  Fanny defended her, and had the harsh language transferred to her own head.</p>
               <p>The young man appeared as usual at the breakfast table, but Fanny had no appetite
                  for food, and did not go down. After breakfast, Logan went to the shop, intending
                  to go to work; but found his place supplied by another journeyman, and himself
                  thrown out of employment, with but a single dollar in his pocket, a months
                  boarding due, and his family in need of almost every comfort. From the shop he
                  went to a tavern, took a glass of liquor, and sat down to look over the
                  newspapers, and think what he should do. There he met an idle journeyman, who,
                  like himself, had lost his situation. A fellow feeling made them communicative and
                  confidential.</p>
               <p>"If I was only a single man," said Logan, "I wouldn't care, I could easily shift
                  for myself."</p>
               <p>"Wife and children! Yes, there's the rub," returned the companion. "A journeyman
                  mechanic is a fool to get married."</p>
               <p>"Then you and I are both fools," said Logan.</p>
               <p>"No doubt of it. I came to that conclusion, in regard to myself, long and long
                  ago. Sick wife, hungry children, and four or five backs to cover; no wonder a poor
                  man's nose is ever on the grindstone. For my part, I am sick of it. When I was a
                  single man, I could go where I pleased, and do what I pleased; and I always had
                  money in my pocket. Now I am tied down to one place, and grumbled at eternally;
                  and if you were to shake me from here to the Navy Yard, you wouldn't get a
                  sixpence out of me. The fact is, I'm sick of it."</p>
               <p>"So am I. But what is to be done? I don't believe I can get work in town."</p>
               <p>"I know you can't. But there is plenty of work and good wages to be had in
                  Charleston or New Orleans."</p>
               <p>Logan did not reply; but looked intently into his companion's face.</p>
               <p>"I'm sure my wife would be a great deal better off if I were to clear out and
                  leave her. She has plenty of friends, and they'll not see her want."</p>
               <p>Logan still looked at his fellow journeyman.</p>
               <p>"And your wife would be taken back under her father's roof, where there is enough
                  and to spare. Of course she would be happier than she is now."</p>
               <p>"No doubt of that. The old rascal has treated her shabbily enough. But I am well
                  satisfied that if I were out of the way he would gladly receive her back
                  again."</p>
               <p>"Of this there can be no question. So, it is clear, that with our insufficient
                  incomes, our presence is a curse rather than a blessing to our families."</p>
               <p>Logan readily admitted this to be true. His companion<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000179"/> then drew a newspaper towards him, and after
                  running his eyes over it for a few moments, read:</p>
               <p>"This day, at twelve o'clock, the copper fastened brig Emily, for Charleston. For
                  freight or passage, apply on board."</p>
               <p>"There's a chance for us," he said, as he finished reading the advertisement. "Let
                  us go down and see if they won't let us work our passage out."</p>
               <p>Logan sat thoughtful a moment, and than said, as he arose to his feet.</p>
               <p>"Agreed. It'll be the best thing for us, as well as for our families."</p>
               <p>When the Emily sailed, at twelve o'clock, the two men were on board.</p>
               <p>Days came and passed, until the heart of Mrs. Logan grew sick with anxiety, fear
                  and suspense. No word was received from her absent husband. She went to his old
                  employer, and learned that he had been discharged; but she could find no one who
                  had heard of him since that time. Left thus alone, with two little children, and
                  no apparent means of support, Mrs. Logan, when she became at length clearly
                  satisfied that he for whom she had given up every thing, had heartlessly abandoned
                  her, felt as if there was no hope for her in the world.</p>
               <p>"Go to your father by all means," urged the woman with whom she was still
                  boarding. "Now that your husband has gone, he will receive you."</p>
               <p>"I cannot," was Fanny's reply.</p>
               <p>"But what will you do?" asked the woman.</p>
               <p>"Work for my children," she replied, arousing herself and speaking with some
                  resolution. "I have hands to work, and I am willing to work."</p>
               <p>"Much better go home to your father," said the woman.</p>
               <p>"That is impossible. He has disowned me. Has ceased to love me or care for me. I
                  cannot go to him again; for I could not bear, as I am now, another harsh repulse.
                  No—no—I will work with my own hands. God will help me to provide for my
                  children."</p>
               <p>In this spirit the almost heart-broken young woman for whom the boarding-house
                  keeper felt more than a common interest—an interest that would not let her thrust
                  her out from the only place she could call her home—sought for work and was
                  fortunate enough to obtain sewing from two or three families, and was thus enabled
                  to pay a light board for herself and children. But incessant toil with her needle,
                  continued late at night and resumed early in the morning, gradually undermined her
                  health, which had become delicate, and weariness and pain became the constant
                  companions of her labor.</p>
               <p>Sometimes in carrying her work home, the forsaken wife would have to pass the old
                  home of her girlhood, and twice she saw her father at the window. But either she
                  was changed so that he did not know his child; or he would not bend from his stern
                  resolution to disown her. On these two occasions she was unable, on returning, to
                  resume her work. Her fingers could not hold or guide the needle; nor could she,
                  from the blinding tears that; filled her eyes have seen to sew, even if her hands
                  had lost the tremor that ran through every nerve of her body.</p>
               <p>A year had rolled wearily by since Logan went off, and still no word had come from
                  the absent husband. Labor beyond her bodily strength, and trouble and grief that
                  were too severe for her spirit to bear, had done sad work upon the forsaken wife
                  and disowned child. She was but a shadow of her former self.</p>
               <p>Mr. Crawford had been very shy of the old Quaker, who had spoken so plainly to
                  him; but his words made some impression on him, though no one would have supposed
                  so, as there was no change in his conduct towards his daughter. He had forewarned
                  her of the consequences, if she acted in opposition to his wishes. He had told her
                  that he would disown her forever. She had taken her own way, and, painful as it
                  was to him, he had to keep his word—his word that had ever been inviolate. He
                  might forgive her; he might pity her; but she must remain a stranger. Such a
                  direct and flagrant act of disobedience to his wishes was not to be forgotten nor
                  forgiven. Thus, in stubborn pride, did his hard heart confirm itself in its cold
                  and cruel estrangement. Was he happy? No! Did he forget his child? No. He thought
                  of her and dreamed of her, day after day, and night after night. But-he had said
                  it, and he would stick to it! His pride was unbending as iron.</p>

               <p>Of the fact that the husband of Fanny had gone off and left her with two children
                  to provide for with the labor of her hands, he had been made fully aware, but it
                  did not bend him from his stern purpose.</p>
               <p>"She is nothing to me," was his impatient reply to the one who informed him of the
                  fact. This was all that could be seen. But his heart trembled at the intelligence. <choice>
                     <sic>Neverthless</sic>
                     <corr>Nevertheless</corr>
                  </choice>, he stood coldly aloof month after month, and even repulsed, angrily,
                  the kind landlady with whom Fanny boarded, who had attempted, all unknown to the
                  daughter, to awaken sympathy for her in her father's heart.</p>
               <p>One day the old Friend, whose plain words had not pleased Mr. Crawford, met that
                  gentleman near his own door. The Quaker was leading a little boy by the hand. Mr.
                  Crawford bowed, and evidently wished to pass on; but the Quaker paused, and
                  said—</p>
               <p>"I should like to have a few words with thee, friend Crawford."</p>
               <p>"Well, say on."</p>
               <p>"Thee is known as a benevolent man, friend Crawford. Thee never refuses, it is
                  said, to do a deed of charity."</p>
               <p>"I always give something when I am sure the object is deserving."</p>
               <p>"So I am aware. Do you see this little boy?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Crawford glanced down at the child the Quaker held by the hand. As he did so,
                  the child lifted to him a gentle face, with mild earnest loving eyes.</p>
               <p>"It is a sweet little fellow," said Mr. Crawford, reaching his hand to the child.
                  He spoke with some feeling, for there was a look about the boy that went to his
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"He is, indeed, a sweet child—and the image of his poor, sick, almost heart-broken
                  mother, for whom I am trying to awaken an interest. She has two children, and this
                  one is the oldest. Her husband is dead, or what may be as bad, perhaps worse, as
                  far as she is concerned, dead to her; and she does not seem to have a relative in
                  the world, at least none who thinks about or cares for her. In trying to provide
                  for her children, she has overtasked her delicate frame, and made herself sick.
                  Unless something is done for her, a worse thing must follow. She must go to the
                  Alms-house, and be separated from her children. Look into the sweet, innocent face
                  of this dear child, and let your heart say whether he ought to be taken from his
                  mother. If she have a woman's feelings, must she not love this child tenderly; and
                  can any one supply to him his mother's place?"</p>
               <p>"I will do something for her, certainly," Mr. Crawford said.</p>
               <p>"I wish thee would go with me to see her."</p>
               <p>"There is no use in that. My seeing her can do no good. Get all you can for her,
                  and then come to me. I will help in the good work cheerfully," replied Mr.
                  Crawford.</p>
               <p>"That is thy dwelling, I believe," said the Quaker, looking around at a house
                  adjoining the one before which they stood.</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is my house," returned Crawford.</p>
               <p>"Will thee take this little boy in with thee, and keep him for a few minutes,
                  while I go to see a friend some squares off?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, certainly. Come with me, dear!" And Mr. Crawford held out his hand to the
                  child, who took it without hesitation.</p>
               <p>"I will see thee in a little while," said the Quaker, as he turned away.</p>
               <p>The boy, who was plainly, but very neatly dressed, was about four years old. He
                  had a more than usually attractive face; and an earnest look out of his mild eyes,
                  that made every one who saw him his friend.</p>
               <p>"What is your name, my dear?" asked Mr. Crawford, as he sat down in his parlor,
                  and took the little fellow upon his knee.</p>
               <p>"Henry," replied the child. He spoke with distinctness; and, as he spoke, there
                  was a sweet expression of the lips and eyes, that was particularly winning.</p>
               <p>"It is Henry, is it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir,"</p>
               <p>"What else besides Henry?"</p>
               <p>The boy did not reply, for he had fixed his eyes upon a picture that hung over the
                  mantle, and was looking at it intently. The eyes of Mr. Crawford followed those
                     of<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC5627-00000181"/> the child, that rested, he found,
                  on the portrait of his daughter.</p>
               <p>"What else besides, Henry?" he repeated.</p>
               <p>"Henry Logan," replied the child, looking for a moment into the face of Mr.
                  Crawford, and then turning to gaze at the picture on the wall. Every nerve
                  quivered in the frame of that man of iron will. The falling of a bolt from a sunny
                  sky could not have startled and surprised him more. He saw in the face of the
                  child, the moment be looked at him, something strangely familiar and attractive.
                  What it was, he did not, until this instant, comprehend. But it was no longer a
                  mystery.</p>
               <p>"Do you know who I am?" he asked, in a subdued voice, after he had recovered, to
                  some extent, his feelings.</p>
               <p>The child looked again into his face, but longer and more earnestly. Then, without
                  answering, he turned and looked at the portrait on the wall.</p>
               <p>"Do you know who I am, dear?" repeated Mr. Crawford.</p>
               <p>"No, sir," replied the child; and then again turned to gaze upon the picture.</p>
               <p>"Who is that?" and Mr. Crawford pointed to the object that so fixed the little
                  boy's attention.</p>
               <p>"My mother." And as he said these words, he laid his head down upon the bosom of
                  his unknown relative, and shrunk close to him, as if half afraid because of the
                  mystery that, in his infantile mind, hung around the picture on the wall.</p>
               <p>Moved by an impulse that he could not restrain, Mr. Crawford drew his arms around
                  the child and hugged him to his bosom. Pride gave way; the iron will was bent; the
                  sternly uttered vow was forgotten. There is power for good in the presence of a
                  little child. Its sphere of innocence subdues and renders impotent the evil
                  spirits that rule in the hearts of selfish men. It was so in this case. Mr.
                  Crawford might have withstood the moving appeal of even his daughter's presence,
                  changed by grief, labor, and suffering, as she was. But his anger, upon which he
                  had suffered the sun to go down, fled before her artless, confiding, innocent
                  child. He thought not of Fanny—as the wilful woman, acting from the dictate of her
                  own passions sions or feelings; but as a little child, lying upon his bosom—as a
                  little child, singing and dancing around him—as a little child, with, to him, the
                  face of a cherub; and the sainted mother of that innocent one by her side.</p>
               <p>When the Friend came for the little boy; Mr. Crawford said to him, in a low
                  voice—made low to hide his emotion—</p>
               <p>"I will keep the child."</p>
               <p>"From its mother?"</p>
               <p>"No. Bring the mother, and the other child. I have room for them all."</p>
               <p>A sunny smile passed over the benevolent countenance of the Friend as he hastily
                  left the room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Logan, worn down by exhausting labor, had at last been forced to give up.
                  When she did give up, every long strained nerve of mind and body instantly
                  relaxed; and she became almost as weak and helpless as an infant. While in this
                  state, she was accidentally discovered by the kind-hearted old Friend, who,
                  without her being aware of what he was going to do, made his successful attack
                  upon her father's feelings. He trusted to nature and a good cause, and did not
                  trust in vain.</p>
               <p>"Come, Mrs. Logan," said the kind woman, with whom Fariny was still boarding, an
                  hour or so after little Henry had been dressed up to take a walk—where, <choice>
                     <sic>the the</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> mother did not know or think,—"the good Friend, who was here this
                  morning, says you must ride out. He has brought a carriage for you, It will do you
                  good, I know. He is very kind. Come, get yourself ready."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Logan was lying upon her bed.</p>
               <p>"I do not feel able to get up," she replied. "I do not wish to ride out."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, you must go. The pure, fresh air, and the change, will do you more good
                  than medicine. Come, Mrs. Logan; I will dress little Julia for you. She needs the
                  change as much as you do."</p>
               <p>"Where is Henry?" asked the mother.</p>
               <p>"He has not returned yet. But, come! The carriage is waiting at the door."</p>
               <p>"Won't you go with me?"</p>
               <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC5627-00000182"/>
               <p>"I would with pleasure—but I cannot leave home. I have so much to do."</p>
               <p>After a good deal of persuasion, Fanny at length made the effort to get herself
                  ready to go out. She was so weak, that she tottered about the floor like one
                  intoxicated. But the woman with whom she lived, assisted and encouraged her, until
                  she was at length ready to go. Then the Quaker came up to her room, and with the
                  tenderness and care of a father, supported her down stairs, and when she had taken
                  her place in the vehicle, entered, with her youngest child in his arms, and sat by
                  her side, speaking to her, as he did so, kind and encouraging words.</p>
               <p>The carriage was driven slowly, for a few squares, and then stopped. Scarcely had
                  the motion ceased, when the door was suddenly opened, and Mr. Crawford stood
                  before his daughter.</p>
               <p>"My poor child!" he said, in a tender, broken voice, as Fanny, overcome by his
                  unexpected appearance, sunk forward into his arms.</p>
               <p>When the suffering young creature opened her eyes again, she was upon her own bed,
                  in her own room, in her old home. Her father sat by her side, and held one of her
                  hands tightly. There were tears in his eyes, and he tried to speak; but, though
                  his lips moved, there came from them no articulate sound.</p>
               <p>"Do you forgive me, father? Do you love me, father?" said Fanny, in a tremulous
                  whisper, half rising from her pillow, and looking eagerly, almost agonizingly,
                  into her father's face.</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to forgive," murmured the father, as he drew his daughter towards
                  him, so that her head could lie against his bosom.</p>
               <p>"But do you love me, father? Do you love me as of old?" said the daughter.</p>
               <p>He bent down and kissed her; and now the tears fell from his eyes and lay warm and
                  glistening upon her face.</p>
               <p>"As of old," he murmured, laying his cheek down upon that of his child, and
                  clasping her more tightly in his arms. The long pent up waters of affection were
                  rushing over his soul and obliterating the marks of pride, anger, and the iron
                  will that sustained them in their cruel dominion. He was no longer a strong man,
                  stern and rigid in his purpose; but a child, with a loving and tender heart.</p>
               <p>There was light again in his dwelling; not the bright light of other times; for
                  now the rays were mellowed. But it was light. And there was music again; not so
                  joyful; but it was music, and its spell over his heart was deeper and its
                  influence more elevating.</p>
               <p>The man with the iron will and stern purpose was subdued, and the power that
                  subdued him, was the presence of a little child.</p>

               <head>A CURE FOR LOW SPIRITS.</head>
               <head type="sub">A HOUSEHOLD SKETCH.</head>
               <p>FROM some cause, real or imaginary, I felt low spirited. There was a cloud upon my
                  feelings, and I could not smile as usual, nor speak in a tone of cheerfulness. As
                  a natural result, the light of my countenance being gone, all things around me
                  were in shadow. My husband was sober, and had little to say; the children would
                  look strangely at me when I answered, their questions, or spoke to them for any
                  purpose, and my domestics moved about in a quiet manner, and when they addressed
                  me, did so in a tone more subdued than usual.</p>
               <p>This re-action upon my state, only made darker the clouds that veiled my spirits.
                  I was conscious of this, and was conscious that the original cause of my
                  depression was entirely inadequate, in itself, to produce the result which had
                  followed. Under this feeling, I made an effort to rally myself, but in vain; and
                  sank lower from the very struggle to rise above the gloom that overshadowed
                  me.</p>
               <p>When my husband came home at dinner time, I tried to meet him with a smile; but I
                  felt that the light upon my countenance was feeble, and of brief duration. He
                  looked at me earnestly, and, in his kind and gentle way, inquired if I felt no
                  better, affecting to believe that my ailment was one of the body instead of the
                  mind. But I scarcely answered him, and I could see that he felt hurt. How much
                  more wretched did I become at this. Could I have then retired to my chamber, and,
                  alone, give my full heart vent in a passion of tears, I might have obtained relief
                  to my feelings. But, I could not do this.</p>
               <p>While I sat at the table, forcing a little food into my mouth for appearance sake,
                  my husband said—</p>
               <p>"You remember the fine lad who has been for some time in our store?"</p>
               <p>I nodded my head, but the question did not awaken in my mind the slightest
                  interest.</p>
               <p>"He has not made his appearance for several days; and I learned this morning, on
                  sending to the house of his mother, that he was very ill."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" was my indifferent response. Had I spoken what was in my mind, I would have
                  said—"I'm sorry, but I can't help it." I did not, at the moment, feel the smallest
                  interest in the lad.</p>
               <p>"Yes," added my husband, "and the person who called to let me know about it,
                  expressed his fears that Edward would not get up again."</p>
               <p>"What ails him?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"I did not clearly understand. But he has fever of some kind. You remember his
                  mother very well?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes. You know she has worked for me. Edward is her only child, I
                  believe."</p>
               <p>"Yes. And his loss to her will be almost every thing."</p>
               <p>"Is he so dangerous?" I inquired, a feeling of interest beginning to stir in my
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"He is not expected to live."</p>
               <p>"Poor woman! How distressed she must be? I wonder what her circumstances are just
                  at this time. She seemed very poor when she worked for me."</p>
               <p>"And she is very poor still, I doubt not. She has herself been sick, and during
                  the time it is more than probable, that Edward's wages were all her income. I am
                  afraid she has suffered, and that she has not, now, the means of procuring for her
                  sick boy things necessary for his comfort. Could you not go around there this
                  afternoon, and see how they are?"</p>
               <p>I shook my head instantly, at this proposition, for sympathy for others was not
                  yet strong enough to expel my selfish despondency of mind.</p>
               <p>"Then I must step around," replied my husband, "before I go back to the store,
                  although we are very busy today, and I am much wanted there. It would not be right
                  to neglect the lad and his mother under present circumstances."</p>
               <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC5627-00000184"/>
               <p>I felt rebuked at these words; and, with a forced effort, said—</p>
               <p>"I will go."</p>
               <p>"It will be much better for you to see them than for me," returned my husband,
                  "for you can understand their wants better, and minister to them more effectually.
                  If they need any comforts, I would like you to see them supplied."</p>
               <p>It still cost me an effort to get ready; but as I had promised that I would do as
                  my husband wished, the effort. had to be made. By the time I was prepared to go
                  out, I felt something better. The exertion I was required to make, tended to
                  disperse slightly the clouds that hung over me, and, as they began gradually to
                  move, my thoughts turned, with an awakening interest, toward the object of my
                  husband's solicitude.</p>
               <p>All was silent within the humble abode to which my errand led me. I knocked
                  lightly, and in a few moments the mother of Edward opened the door. She looked
                  pale and anxious.</p>
               <p>"How is your son, Mrs. Ellis?" I inquired, as I stepped in.</p>
               <p>"He is very low, ma'am," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Not dangerous, I hope?"</p>
               <p>"The fever has left him, but he is as weak as an infant. All his strength is
                  gone."</p>
               <p>"But proper nourishment will restore him, if the disease is broken."</p>
               <p>"So the doctor says. But I'm afraid it is too late. He seems to be sinking every
                  hour. Will you walk up and see him, ma'am?'</p>
               <p>I followed Mrs. Ellis up stairs, and into the chamber where the sick boy lay. I
                  was not surprised at the fear she had expressed, when I saw Edward's pale, sunken
                  face, and hollow, almost expressionless eyes. He scarcely noticed my entrance.</p>
               <p>"Poor boy!" sighed his mother. "He has had a very sick spell." My liveliest
                  interest was at once awakened.</p>
               <p>"He has been sick indeed!" I replied, as I laid my hand upon his white forehead. I
                  found that his skin was, cold and damp. The fever had nearly burned out the vital
                  energies of his system. "Do you give him much nourishment?"</p>
               <p>"He takes a little barley water."</p>
               <p>"Has not the doctor ordered wine?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Mr. Ellis, but she spoke with an air of hesitation. "He says
                  a spoonful of good wine, three or four times a day, would be very good for
                  him."</p>
               <p>"And you have not given him any?"</p>
               <p>"No ma'am,"</p>
               <p>"We have some very pure wine, that we always keep for sickness. If you will step
                  over to our house, and tell Alice to give you a bottle of it, I will stay with
                  Edward until you return."</p>
               <p>How brightly glowed that woman's face, as my words fell upon her ears!</p>
               <p>"Oh, ma'am you are very kind!" said she. "But it will be asking too much of you to
                  stay here!"</p>
               <p>"You did'nt ask it, Mrs. Ellis," I smilingly replied. "I have offered to stay; so
                  do you go for the wine as quickly as you can, for Edward needs it very much."</p>
               <p>I was not required to say more. In a few minutes I was alone with the sick boy,
                  who lay almost as still as if death were resting upon his half closed eye-lids. To
                  some extent, in the half hour I remained thus in that hushed chamber, did I
                  realize the condition and feelings of the poor mother whose only son lay gasping
                  at the very door of death, and all my sympathies were, in consequence,
                  awakened.</p>
               <p>As soon as Mrs. Ellis returned with the wine, about a tea spoonful of it was
                  diluted, and the glass containing it placed to the sick lad's lips. The moment its
                  flavor touched his palate, a thrill seemed to pass through his frame, and he
                  swallowed eagerly.</p>
               <p>"It does him good!" said I, speaking warmly, and from an impulse of pleasure that
                  made my heart glow.</p>
               <p>We sat, and looked with silent interest upon the boy's face, and we did not look
                  in vain, for something like warmth came upon his wan cheeks, and when I placed my
                  hand again upon his forehead, the coldness and dampness was gone. The wine had
                  quickened his languid pulses. I staid an hour longer, and then another spoonful of
                  the generous wine was given. Its effect was as<pb n="368-369"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000185"/> marked as at first. I then withdrew from the humble
                  home of the widow and her only child, promising to see them again in the
                  morning.</p>
               <p>When I regained the street and my thoughts, for a moment, reverted to myself, how
                  did I find all changed. The clouds had been dispersed—the heavy hand raised from
                  my bosom, I walked with a freer step. Sympathy for others, and active efforts to
                  do others good, had expelled the evil spirits from my heart; and now serene peace
                  had there again her quiet habitation. There was light in every part of my dwelling
                  when I re-entered it, and I sung cheerfully, as I prepared, with my own hands, a
                  basket of provisions for the poor widow.</p>
               <p>When my husband returned in the evening, he found me at work, cheerfully, in my
                  family, and all bright and smiling again. The effort to do good to others had
                  driven away the darkness from my spirit, and the sunshine was again upon my
                  countenance, and reflected from every member of my household.—<title>Lady's

                  <p>"HOW much salary do they offer?" asked Mrs. Carroll of her husband, who was
                     sitting near her with a letter in his hand. He had just communicated the fact
                     that a Parish was tendered him in the Village of Y——, distant a little over a
                     hundred and fifty miles.</p>
                  <p>"The money is your first thought, Edith," said Mr. Carroll, half chidingly, yet
                     with an affectionate smile.</p>
                  <p>This remark caused a slight flush to pass over the face of Mrs. Carroll. She
                     replied, glancing, as she did so, towards a bed on which lay three
                     children.</p>
                  <p>"Is it wrong to think of the little ones whom God has given to us?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no! But we must believe that God who calls us to labor in his vineyard,
                     will feed both us and our children."</p>
                  <p>"How are we to know that HE calls us, Edward?" inquired Mrs. Carroll.</p>
                  <p>"I hold the evidence in my hand. This letter from the vestry of Y—— Parish
                     contains the call."</p>
                  <p>"It may be only the call of man."</p>
                  <p>"Edith!—Edith!—Your faith is weak; weak almost as the expiring flame."</p>
                  <p>"What do they say in that letter? Will you read it to me."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes." And Mr. Carroll read— <q>

                                 <p>"REV. AND DEAR SIR:—Our Parish has been for some months without
                                    a minister. On the recommendation of Bishop—, we have been led
                                    to make you an offer of the vacant place. The members of the
                                    church, generally, are in moderate circumstances, and we cannot,
                                       therefore,<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC5627-00000186"/> offer
                                    anything more than a moderate living. There is a neat little
                                    parsonage, to which is attached a small garden, for the use of
                                    the minister. The salary is three hundred dollars. You will find
                                    the people kind and intelligent, and likewise prepossessed in
                                    your favor. The Bishop has spoken of you warmly. We should like
                                    to hear from you as early as convenient.</p>
                                 <closer>
                                    <signed>"Very affectionately, &amp;c. &amp;c."</signed>

                  <p>"Three hundred dollars!" said Mrs. Carroll in a disappointed tone.</p>
                  <p>"And the parsonage," added Mr. Carroll, quickly.</p>
                  <p>"Equivalent to sixty or seventy more."</p>
                  <p>"Equivalent to a hundred dollars more, at least."</p>
                  <p>"We are doing much better here, Edward."</p>
                  <p>"True! But are we to look to worldly advantage alone?"</p>
                  <p>"We have a duty to discharge to our children, which, it seems to me, comes
                     before all other duties."</p>
                  <p>"God will take care of these tender lambs, Edith, do not fear. He has called me
                     to preach his everlasting Gospel, and I have heard and answered. Now He points
                     to the field of labor, and shall I hold back because the wages seem small? I
                     have not so learned my duty. Though lions stood in the way, I would walk in it
                     with a fearless heart. Be not afraid. The salvation of souls is a precious
                     work, and they who are called to the labor will not lack for bread."</p>
                  <p>"But Edward," said the wife, in a serious voice, "will it be right for us to
                     enter any path of life blindfold, as it were? God has given us reason for a
                     guide; and should we not be governed by its plain dictate?"</p>
                  <p>"We must walk by faith, Edith, and not by sight," replied Mr. Carroll, in a
                     tone that indicated some small measure of impatience.</p>
                  <p>"A true faith, dear husband!" said Mrs. Carroll tenderly, while a slight
                     suffusion appeared about her eyes.,</p>
                  <p>"A true faith is ever enlightened and guided by reason. When reason plainly
                     points the way, faith bids us walk on with unfaltering steps."</p>
                  <p>"And does not reason now point the way?" asked Mr. Carroll."</p>
                  <p>"I think not. From our school we receive nearly seven hundred dollars; and we
                     have not found that sum too large for our support. I know that I work very
                     hard, and that I find it as much as I can do to keep all things
                     comfortable."</p>
                  <p>"But remember that we have rent to pay."</p>
                  <p>"I know. Still a little over five hundred dollars remain. And the present offer
                     is only three hundred. Edward, we cannot live upon this sum. Think of our three
                     children. And my health, you know, is not good. I am not so strong as I was,
                     and cannot go through as much."</p>
                  <p>The wife's voice trembled.</p>
                  <p>"Poor, weak doubter!" said Mr. Carroll, in a tender, yet reproving voice. "Does
                     not He who calls us to this labor know our wants? And is not He able to supply
                     them? Have you forgotten that the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof?
                     Whose are the cattle upon a thousand hills? Did not God feed Elijah by ravens?
                     Did the widow's oil fail? Be not doubtful but believing, Edith! And what if we
                     do have to meet a few hardships, and endure many privations? Are these to be
                     counted against the salvation of even one precious soul? The harvest is great,
                     hut the laborers are few."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Carroll knew her husband well enough to be assured that if he believed it
                     to be his duty to accept a call from Lapland or the Indian Ocean, he would go.
                     Yet, so strongly did both reason and feeling oppose the contemplated change,
                     that she could not help speaking out what was in her mind.</p>
                  <p>"The day of miracles is past," she replied.</p>
                  <p>"We must not expect God to send us bread from heaven if we go into a
                     wilderness, nor water from the rock, if we wander away to some barren desert.
                     This Parish of Y—— cannot afford living to any but a single man, and,
                     therefore, it seems to me that none but a single man should accept their call.
                     Wait longer, Edward. We have every comfort for our children, and you are
                     engaged in a highly useful employment. When the right field for ministerial
                     labor offers, God will call you in a manner so clear that you need not feel a
                     doubt on the subject."</p>
                  <p>"I feel no doubt now," said Mr. Carroll. "I recognise<pb n="372-373"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000187"/> the voice of my Master, and must obey. And I
                     will obey without fear. Our bread will be given and our water sure. Ah! Edith.
                     If you could only see with me, eye to eye. If you could only take up your cross
                     hopefully, and walk I by my side, how light would seem all the burden I have to
                     bear?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Carroll felt the words of her husband, as a rebuke. This silenced all
                     opposition.</p>
                  <p>"I know that I am weak and fearful," she murmured, leaning her head upon her
                     husband, and concealing her face. "But I will try to have courage. If you feel
                     it to be your duty to accept this call, I will go with you; and, come what may,
                     will not vex your ears by a complaining word. It was only for our little ones
                     that I felt troubled."</p>
                  <p>"The Lord will provide, Edith. He never sends any one upon a journey at his own
                     cost. Fear not: we have the God of harvest on our side."</p>
                  <p>The will of Mr. Carroll decided in this, as in almost every thing else. He saw
                     reason to accept the call, and did not therefore, perceive any force in his
                     wife's objections.</p>
                  <p>The school, from which a comfortable living had been obtained, was given up; an
                     old home and old friends abandoned. Prompt as Mr. Carroll had been to accept
                     the call to Y——, the process of breaking up did not take place without some
                     natural feelings coming in to disturb him. How he was to support his wife and
                     children on three hundred dollars, did not exactly appear. It had cost him,
                     annually, the sum of five hundred, exclusive of rent; and no one could affirm
                     that he had lived extravagantly. But he dismissed such unpleasant thoughts by
                     saying, mentally—</p>
                  <p>"Away with these sinful doubts! I will not be faithless, but believing."</p>
                  <p>As for Mrs. Carroll, who felt, in view of the coming trials and labor, that she
                     had but little strength; the parting from the old place where she had known so
                     many happy hours, gave her deeper pain than she had ever experienced. Strive as
                     she would, she could not keep up her spirits. She could not feel any assurance
                     for the future,—could not put her entire trust in Heaven. To her the hopeful
                     spirit of her husband seemed a blind confidence, and not a rational faith. But,
                     even while she felt thus, she condemned herself for the feeling; and
                     strove—with how little effect!—to walk sustainingly by the side of her
                     husband.</p>

                  <head>THE CHANGE.</head>
                  <p>Six months have elapsed since Mr Carroll accepted the call to Y——. He has
                     preached faithfully and labored diligently. That was his part. And he has
                     received, quarterly, on the day it became due, his salary. That was according
                     to the contract on the other side. His conscience is clear on the score of
                     duty; and his parishioners are quite as well satisfied that they have done all
                     that is required of them. They offered him three hundred a year and the
                     parsonage. He accepted the offer; and, by that act, declared the living to be
                     adequate to his wants. If he was satisfied they were.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know how he gets along on three hundred dollars," some one, more
                     thoughtful about such matters, would occasionally say. "It costs me double that
                     sum, and my family is no larger than his."</p>
                  <p>"They get a great many presents," would, in all probability, be replied to
                     this. "Mr. A——, I know, sent them a load of wood some time ago; a Mr. B—— told
                     me that he had sent them a quarter of lamb and a bushel of apples. And I have,
                     two or three times, furnished one little matter and another. I'm sure what is
                     given to them will amount to half as much as Mr. Carroll's salary."</p>
                  <p>"This makes a difference, of course," is the satisfied answer. And yet, all
                     told, the presents received by the whole family, in useful articles, has not
                     reached the value of twenty-five dollars during six months. And this has been
                     more than abstracted from them by the kind ladies of the parish, who must needs
                     visit and take tea with the minister as often as convenient.</p>
                  <p>Six months had passed since the Rev. Mr. Carroll removed to Y——. It was
                     mid-winter; and a stormy day closed in with as stormy a night. The rays which
                        came<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC5627-00000188"/> through the minister's
                     little study-window grew faint in the pervading shadows, and he could no longer
                     see with sufficient clearness to continue writing. So he went down stairs to
                     the room in which were his wife and children. The oldest child was a daughter,
                     six years of age, named Edith from her mother. Edward, between three and four
                     years old, and Aggy the baby, made up the number of Mr. Carroll's household
                     treasures. They were all just of an age to require their mother's attention in
                     every thing. As her husband entered the room, Mrs. Carroll said—</p>
                  <p>"I'm glad you've come down, dear. I can't get Aggy out of my arms a minute.
                     It's nearly supper time, and I havn't been able even to put the kettle on the
                     fire. She's very fretful."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Carroll took the baby. His wife threw a shawl over her head, and taking an
                     empty bucket from the dresser, was passing to the door, when her husband
                     said—</p>
                  <p>"Stop, stop, Edith! You musn't go for water in this storm. Here, take the
                     baby."</p>
                  <p>"I can go well enough," replied Mrs. Carroll, and before her husband could
                     prevent her, she was out in the blustering air, with the snowflakes driving in
                     her face.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Edith! Edith! Why will you do so?" said her husband, as soon as she came
                     back.</p>
                  <p>"It's as easy for me to go as for you," she replied.</p>
                  <p>"No it isn't, Edith. I am strong to what you are. If you expose yourself in
                     this way, it will be the death of you."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Carroll shook the snow from her shawl and dress, and brushed it from her
                     shoes, saying as she did so—</p>
                  <p>"Oh no! a little matter like this won't hurt me."</p>
                  <p>She then filled the tea-kettle and placed it over the fire. After which she set
                     out the table, and busied herself in getting ready their evening meal.
                     Meanwhile, Mr. Carroll walked the floor with Aggy in his arms, both looking and
                     feeling serious; while the two older children amused themselves with a picture
                     book.</p>
                  <p>As the reader has probably anticipated, the "living" (?) at Y—— proved
                     altogether inadequate to the wants of Mr. Carroll's family; and faith,
                     confidence, and an abstract trust in Providence by no means sufficed for its
                     increase. At first, Mrs. Carroll had a servant girl to help her in her
                     household duties, as usual. But she soon found that this would not do. A dollar
                     and a quarter a week, and the cost of boarding the girl, took just about
                     one-third of their entire income. So, after the first three months, "help" was
                     dispensed with. The washing had to be put out; which cost half a dollar,
                     weekly. To get some one in the house to iron, would cost as much more. So Mrs.
                     Carroll took upon herself the task of ironing all the clothes, in addition to
                     the entire work of the house and care of her three children.</p>
                  <p>For three months this hard labor was performed; but not without a visible
                     effect. The face of Mrs. Carroll grew thinner; her step lost its lightness; and
                     her voice its cheerful tone. All this her husband saw, and saw with intense
                     pain. But, there was no remedy. His income was but three hundred dollars a
                     year; and out of that small sum it was impossible to pay one hundred for the
                     wages and board of a girl, and have enough left for the plainest food and
                     clothing. There was, therefore, no alternative. All that it was in his power to
                     do, was done by Mr. Carroll to lighten the heavy burdens under which his wife
                     was sinking; but it was only a little, in reality, that he could do; and he was
                     doomed to see her daily wasting away, and her strength departing from her.</p>
                  <p>At the time we have introduced them, Mrs. Carroll had begun to show some
                     symptoms of failing health, that alarmed her husband seriously. She had taken
                     cold, which was followed by a dry, fatiguing cough, and a more than usual
                     prostration of strength. On coming in with her bucket of water from the well,
                     as just mentioned, she did not take off her shoes, and brush away the snow that
                     had been pressed in around the tops against her stockings, but suffered it to
                     lie there and melt, thus wetting her feet. It was nearly an hour from the time
                     Mr. Carroll came down from his room, before supper was ready. Aggy was, by this
                     time, asleep; so that the mother could pour out the tea without having, as was
                     usually the case, to hold the baby in her arms.</p>
                  <p>"Ain't you going to eat anything?" asked Mr. Carroll,<pb n="376-377"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000189"/> seeing that his wife, whose face looked flushed,
                     only sipped a little tea.</p>
                  <p>"I don't feel any appetite," replied Mrs. Carroll.</p>
                  <p>"But you'd better try to eat something, dear."</p>
                  <p>Just then there was a knock at the door. On opening it, Mr. Carroll found a
                     messenger with a request for him to go and see a parishioner who was ill.</p>
                  <p>"You can't go away there in this storm," said his wife, as soon as the
                     messenger had retired.</p>
                  <p>"It's full a mile off."</p>
                  <p>"I must go, Edith," replied the minister. "If the distance were many miles
                     instead of one, it would be all the same. Duty calls."</p>
                  <p>And out into the driving storm the minister went, and toiled on his lonely way
                     through the deep snow to reach the bedside of a suffering fellow man, who
                     sought spiritual consolation in the hour of sickness, from one whose temporal
                     wants he had, while in health, shown but little inclination to supply. That
                     consolation offered, he turned his face homeward again, and again breasted the
                     unabated storm. He found his wife in bed—something unusual for her at ten
                     o'clock—and, on laying his hand upon her face, discovered that she was in a
                     high fever. In alarm, he went for the doctor, who declined going out, but sent
                     medicine, and promised to come over in the morning.</p>
                  <p>In the morning Mrs. Carroll was much worse, and unable to rise. To dress the
                     children and get breakfast, Mr. Carroll found to be tasks of no very easy
                     performance for him; and as soon as they were completed, he called in a
                     neighbor to stay with his wife while he went in search of some one to come and
                     take her place in the family until she was able to go about again as usual.</p>
                  <p>That time, however, did not soon come. Weeks passed before she could even sit
                     up, and then she was so susceptible of cold, that even the slightest draft of
                     air into the room affected her; and so weak, that, in attempting to mend a
                     garment for one of her children, the exertion caused her to faint away.</p>
                  <p>When Mrs. Carroll was taken sick, they had only fifteen dollars of their
                     quarter's salary left. It was but two weeks since they had received it, yet
                     nearly all was gone, for twenty-five dollars, borrowed to meet expenses during
                     the last month of the quarter, had to be paid according to promise: shoes for
                     nearly every member of the family had to be purchased, besides warmer clothing
                     for themselves and children; and several little bills unavoidably contracted,
                     had to be settled. The extra expense of sickness, added to the regular demand,
                     soon melted away the trifling balance, and Mr. Carroll found himself, with his
                     wife still unable to leave her room—in fact, scarcely able to sit up—penniless
                     and almost hopeless.—His faith had grown weak—his confidence was gone—his
                     spirits were broken. Daily he prayed for strength to bear up; for a higher
                     trust in Providence; for light upon his dark pathway.—But no strength came, no
                     confidence was created, no light shone upon his way. And for this we need not
                     wonder. It was no day of miracles, as his wife had forewarned him. He had, as
                     too many do, hoped for sustenance in a field of labor where reason could find
                     no well-grounded hope. He knew that he could not live on three hundred a year;
                     yet he had accepted the offer, in the vain hope that all would come out
                     well!</p>
                  <p>The last shilling left the hand of the unhappy minister, and at least six weeks
                     remained before another quarter's salary became due. He could not let his
                     family starve; so, after much thought, he finally determined to call the vestry
                     together, frankly state his case, and tell his brethren that it was impossible
                     for him to live on the small sum they allowed.</p>
                  <p>A graver meeting of the vestry of Y—— parish had not for a long time taken
                     place. As for an increase of salary, that was declared to be out of the
                     question entirely. They had never paid any one over three hundred dollars,
                     which, with the parsonage, had always been considered a very liberal
                     compensation. They were very sorry for Mr. Carroll, and would advance him a
                     quarter's salary. But all increase was out of the question. They knew the
                     people would not hear to it. The meeting then broke up, and the official
                     members of the church walked gravely away, while Mr. Carroll went home, feeling
                     so sad and dispirited, that he almost wished that he could die.</p>
                  <p>The Parish of Y—— was not rich; though six hundred<pb n="378-379"
                        xml:id="VAC5627-00000190"/> dollars could have been paid to a minister with
                     as little inconvenience to the members as three hundred. But the latter sum was
                     considered ample; and much surprise was manifested when it was found that the
                     new minister asked for an increase, even before the first year of his
                     engagement had expired.</p>
                  <p>The face of his wife had never looked so pale, her cheeks so thin, nor her eyes
                     so sunken, to the minister, as when he came home from this mortifying and
                     disheartening meeting of the vestry. One of those present was the very person
                     he had gone a mile to visit on the night of the snow-storm; and he had more to
                     say that hurt him than any of the rest.</p>
                  <p>"Edith," said Mr. Carroll, taking the thin hand of his wife, as he sat down by
                     her and looked sadly into her face, "we must leave here."</p>
                  <p>"Must we? Why?" she asked, without evincing very marked surprise.</p>
                  <p>"We cannot live on three hundred a year."</p>
                  <p>"Where will we go?"</p>
                  <p>"Heaven only knows! But we cannot remain here!"</p>
                  <p>And as the minister said this, he bowed his head until his face rested upon the
                     arm of his wife. He tried to hide his emotion, but Edith knew that tears were
                     upon the cheeks of her husband.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>THE SEQUEL.</head>
                  <p>JUST one year has elapsed, since Mr. Carroll accepted the call from Y——. It has
                     been a year of trouble, ending in deep affliction. When the health of Mrs.
                     Carroll yielded under her too heavy burdens, it did not come back again.
                     Steadily she continued to sink, after the first brief rallying of her system,
                     until it became hopelessly apparent that the time of her departure was near at
                     hand. She was too fragile a creature to be thrown into the position she
                     occupied. Inheriting a delicate constitution, and raised with even an unwise
                     tenderness, she was no more fitted to be a pastor's wife, with only three
                     hundred a year to live upon, than a summer flower is to take the place of a
                     hardy autumn plant. This her husband should have known and taken into the
                     account, before he decided to accept the call from Y——.</p>
                  <p>When it was found that Mrs. Carroll, after partially recovering from her first
                     severe attack, began, gradually to sink; a strong interest in her favor was
                     awakened among the ladies of the congregation, and they showed her many kind
                     attentions. But all these attentions, and all this kindness, did not touch the
                     radical disability under which she was suffering. They did not remove her too
                     heavy weight of care and labor. All the help in her family that she felt
                     justified in employing, was a girl between fourteen and fifteen years of age,
                     and this left so much for her to do in the care of her children, and in
                     necessary household duties that she suffered all the time from extreme physical
                     exhaustion.</p>
                  <p>In the just conviction of the error he had committed, and while he felt the
                     hopelessness of his condition, Mr. Carroll, as has been seen, resolved to leave
                     Y—— immediately. This design he hinted to one of the members of his church.</p>
                  <p>"You engaged with us for a year, did you not?" enquired the member.</p>
                  <p>That settled the question in the mind of the unhappy minister. He said no more
                     to any one on the subject of his income, or about leaving the parish. But his
                     mind was made up not to remain a single day, after his contract had expired. If
                     in debt at the time, as he knew he must be, he would free himself from the
                     incumbrances by selling a part of his household furniture. Meantime his
                     liveliest fears were aroused for his wife, as symptom after symptom of a rapid
                     decline, showed themselves. That he did not preach as good sermons, nor visit
                     as freely among his parishioners during the last three months of the time he
                     remained at Y——, is no matter of surprise. Some, more considerate than the
                     rest, excused him; but others complained, even to the minister himself. No
                     matter. Mr. Carroll had too much at home to fill his heart to leave room for a
                     troubled pulsation on this account. He was conscience-clear on the score of
                     obligation to his parishioners.</p>

                  <p>At last, and this before the year had come to its close, the drooping wife and
                     mother took to her bed, never again to leave it until carried forth by the
                     mourners. We will not pain the reader by any details of the affecting scenes
                     attendant upon the last few weeks of her mortal life; nor take him to the
                     bed-side of the dying one, in the hour that she passed away. To state the fact
                     that she died, is enough—and painful enough.</p>
                  <p>For all this, it did not occur to the people of Y—— that, in anything they had
                     been lacking. They had never given but three hundred a year to a minister, and,
                     as a matter of course, considered the sum as much as a reasonable man could
                     expect. As for keeping a clergyman in luxury, and permitting him to get rich;
                     they did not think it consistent with the office he held, which required
                     self-denial and a renouncing of the world. As to how he could live on so small
                     a sum, that was a question rarely asked; and when presented, was put to rest by
                     some backhanded kind of an answer, that left the matter as much in the dark as
                     ever.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the deep waters of affliction through which Mr. Carroll was
                     required to pass, his Sabbath duties were but once omitted, and that on the day
                     after he had looked for the last time upon the face of his lost one. Four
                     Sabbaths more he preached, and then, in accordance with notice a short time
                     previously given, resigned his pastoral charge. There were many to urge him
                     with great earnestness not to leave them; but a year's experience enabled him
                     to see clearer than he did before, and to act with greater decision. In the
                     hope of retaining him, the vestry strained a point, and offered to make the
                     salary three hundred and fifty dollars. But much to their surprise, the liberal
                     offer was refused.</p>
                  <p>It happened that the Bishop of the Diocese came to visit Y—— a week before Mr.
                     Carroll intended taking his departure with his motherless children, for his old
                     home, where a church had been offered him in connexion with a school. To him,
                     three or four prominent members of the church complained that the minister was
                     mercenary, and looked more to the loaves and fishes than to the duty of saving
                     souls.</p>
                  <p>"Mercenary!" said the Bishop, with a strong expression of surprise.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, mercenary," repeated his accusers.</p>
                  <p>"So far from it," said the Bishop, warmly, "he has paid more during the year,
                     for supporting the Gospel in Y——, than any five men in the parish put
                     together."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Carroll has!"</p>
                  <p>"How much do you give?" addressing one.</p>
                  <p>"I pay ten dollars pew rent, and give ten extra, besides," was the answer.</p>
                  <p>"And you," speaking to another.</p>
                  <p>"The same."</p>
                  <p>"And you?"</p>
                  <p>"Thirty dollars, in all."</p>
                  <p>"While," said the Bishop, speaking with increased warmth, "your minister gave
                     two hundred dollars."</p>
                  <p>This, of course, took them greatly by surprise, and they asked for an
                     explanation. "It is given in a few words," returned the Bishop. "It cost him,
                     though living in the most frugal manner, five hundred dollars for the year. Of
                     this, you paid three hundred, and he two hundred dollars."</p>
                  <p>"I don't understand you, Bishop," said one.</p>
                  <p>"Plainly, then; he was in debt at the end of the year, two hundred dollars, for
                     articles necessary for the health and comfort of his family, to pay which he
                     has sold a large part of his furniture. He was not working for himself, but for
                     you, and, therefore, actually paid two hundred dollars for the support of the
                     Gospel in Y——, while you paid but twenty or thirty dollars apiece. Under these
                     circumstances, my friends, be assured that the charge of being mercenary, comes
                     with an exceeding bad grace. Nor is this all that he has sacrificed. An
                     insufficient income threw upon his wife, duties beyond her strength to bear;
                     and she sunk under them. Had you stepped forward in time, and lightened these
                     duties by a simple act of justice, she night still be living to bless her
                     husband and children!—Three hundred a year for a man with a wife and three
                     children, is not enough; and you know it, my brethren! Not one of you could
                     live on less than double the sum."</p>
                  <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC5627-00000192"/>
                  <p>This rebuke came with a stunning force upon the ears of men who had expected
                     the Bishop to agree with them in their complaint, and had its effect. On the
                     day Mr. Carroll left the village, he received a kind and sympathetic letter
                     from the official members of the church enclosing the sum of two hundred
                     dollars. The first impulse of his natural feelings was to return the enclosure,
                     but reflection showed him that such an act would be wrong; and so he retained
                     it, after such acknowledgments as he deemed the occasion required.</p>
                  <p>Back to his old home the minister went, but with feelings, how different, alas!
                     from those he had experienced on leaving for Y——. The people among whom he had
                     labored for a year, felt as if they had amply paid him for all the service he
                     had rendered; in fact had overpaid him, as if money, doled out grudgingly,
                     could compensate for all he had sacrificed and suffered, in his effort to break
                     for them the Bread of Life.</p>
                  <p>Here is one of the phases of ministerial life, presented with little ornament
                     or attractiveness. There are many other phases, more pleasant to look upon, and
                     far more flattering to the good opinion we are all inclined to entertain of
                     ourselves. But it is not always best to look upon the fairest side. The cold
                     reality of things, it is needful that we should sometimes see. The parish of
                     Y——, does not, by any means, stand alone. And Mr. Carroll is not, the only man
                     who has suffered wrong from the hands of those who called him to minister in
                     spiritual things, yet neglected duly to provide for the natural and necessary
                     wants of the body.</p>

               <head>I'LL SEE ABOUT IT.</head>
               <p>MR. EASY sat alone in his counting room, one afternoon, in a most comfortable
                  frame, both as regards mind and body. A profitable speculation in the morning had
                  brought the former into a state of great complacency, and a good dinner had done
                  all that was required for the repose of the latter. He was in that delicious, half
                  asleep, half awake condition, which, occurring after dinner, is so very pleasant.
                  The newspaper, whose pages at first possessed a charm for his eye, had fallen,
                  with the hand that held—it, upon his knee. His head was gently reclined backwards
                  against the top of a high, leather cushioned chair; while his eyes, half opened,
                  saw all things around him but imperfectly. Just at this time the door was quietly
                  opened, and a lad of some fifteen or sixteen years, with a pale, thin face, high
                  forehead, and large dark eyes, entered. He approached the merchant with a
                  hesitating step, and soon stood directly before him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Easy felt disturbed at this intrusion, for so he felt it. He knew the lad to
                  be the son of a poor widow, who had once seen better circumstances than those that
                  now surrounded her. Her husband had, while living, been his intimate friend, and
                  he had promised him, at his dying hour, to be the protector and adviser of his
                  wife and children. He had meant to do all he promised, but, not being very fond of
                  trouble, except where stimulated to activity by the hope of gaining some good for
                  himself, he had not been as thoughtful in regard to Mrs. Mayberry as he ought to
                  have been. She was a modest, shrinking, sensitive woman, and had, notwithstanding
                  her need of a friend and adviser, never called upon Mr. Easy, or even sent to
                  request him to act for her in any thing, except once. Her husband had left her
                  poor. She knew little of the world. She had three quite young children, and one,
                  the oldest, about sixteen. Had Mr. Easy been true to his<pb n="384-385"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000193"/> pledge, he might have thrown many a ray upon her
                  dark path, and lightened her burdened heart of many a doubt and fear. But he had
                  permitted more than a year to pass since the death of her husband, without having
                  once called upon her. This neglect had not been intentional. His will was good but
                  never active at the present moment. "To-morrow," or "next week," or "very soon,"
                  he would call upon Mrs. Mayberry; but to-morrow, or next week, or very soon, had
                  never yet come.</p>
               <p>As for the widow, soon after her husband's death, she found that poverty was to be
                  added to affliction. A few hundred dollars made up the sum of all that she
                  received after the settlement of his business, which had never been in a very
                  prosperous condition. On this, under the exercise of extreme frugality, she had
                  been enabled to live for nearly a year. Then the paucity of her little store made
                  it apparent to her mind that individual exertion was required directed towards
                  procuring the means of support for her little family. Ignorant of the way in which
                  this was to be done, and having no one to advise her, nearly two months more
                  passed before she could determine what to do. By that time she had but a few
                  dollars left, and was in a state of great mental distress and uncertainty. She
                  then applied for work at some of the shops, and obtained common sewing, but at
                  prices that could not yield her any thing like a support.</p>
               <p>Hiram, her oldest son, had been kept at school up to this period. But now she had
                  to withdraw him. It was impossible any longer to pay his tuition fees. He was an
                  intelligent lad—active in mind, and pure in his moral principles. But like his
                  mother; sensitive, and inclined to avoid observation. Like her, too, he had a
                  proud independence of feeling, that made him shrink from asking or accepting a
                  favor, putting himself under an obligation to any one. He first became aware of
                  his mother's true condition, when she took him from school, and explained the
                  reason for so doing. At once his mind rose into the determination to do something
                  to aid his mother. He felt a glowing confidence, arising from the consciousness of
                  strength within. He felt that he had both the will and the power to act, and to
                  act efficiently.</p>
               <p>"Don't be disheartened, mother," he said, with animation. "I can and will do
                  something. I can help you. You have worked for me a great many years. Now I will
                  work for you."</p>
               <p>Where there is a will, there is a way. But it is often the case, that the will
                  lacks the kind of intelligence that enables it to find the right way at once. So
                  it proved in the case of Hiram Mayberry. He had a strong enough will, but did not
                  know how to bring it into activity. Good, without its appropriate truth, is
                  impotent. Of this the poor lad soon became conscious. To the question of his
                  mother—</p>
               <p>"What can you do, child!" an answer came not so readily.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I can do a great many things," was easily said; but, even in saying so, a
                  sense of inability followed the first thought of what he should do, that the
                  declaration awakened.</p>
               <p>The will impels, and then the understanding seeks for the means of affecting the
                  purposes of the will. In the case of young Hiram, thought followed affection. He
                  pondered for many days over the means by which he was to aid his mother. But, the
                  more he thought, the more conscious did he become, that, in the world, he was a
                  weak boy. That however strong might be his purpose, his means of action were
                  limited. His mother could aid him but little. She had but one suggestion to make,
                  and that was, that he should endeavor, to get a situation in some store, or
                  counting room. This he attempted to do. Following her direction, he called upon
                  Mr. Easy, who promised to see about looking him up a situation. It happened, the
                  day after, that a neighbor spoke to him about a lad for his store—(Mr. Easy had
                  already forgotten his promise)—Hiram was recommended, and the man called to see
                  his mother.</p>
               <p>"How much salary can you afford to give him?" asked Mrs. Mayberry, after learning
                  all about the situation, and feeling satisfied that her son should accept of
                  it.</p>
               <p>"Salary, ma'am?" returned the storekeeper, in a tone of surprise. "We never give a
                  boy any salary for the first year. The knowledge that is acquired of business
                     is<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC5627-00000194"/> always considered a full
                  compensation. After the first year, if he likes us, and we like him, we may give
                  him seventy-five or a hundred dollars."</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Mayberry's countenance fell immediately.</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't think of his going out now, if it were not in the hope of his earning
                  something," she said in a disappointed voice.</p>
               <p>"How much did you expect him to earn?" was asked by the storekeeper.</p>
               <p>"I didn't know exactly what to expect. But I supposed that he might earn four or
                  five dollars a week."</p>
               <p>"Five dollars a week is all we pay our porter, an able bodied, industrious man,"
                  was returned. "If you wish your son to become acquainted with mercantile business,
                  you must not expect him to earn much for three or four years. At a trade you may
                  receive for him barely a sufficiency to board and clothe him, but nothing
                  more."</p>
               <p>This declaration so dampened the feelings of the mother that she could not reply
                  for some moments. At length she said—</p>
               <p>"If you will take my boy with the understanding, that, in case I am not able to
                  support him, or hear of a situation where a salary can be obtained, you will let
                  him leave your employment without hard feelings, he shall go into your store at
                  once."</p>
               <p>To this the man consented, and Hiram Mayberry went with him according to
                  agreement. A few weeks passed, and the lad, liking both the business and his
                  employer, his mother felt exceedingly anxious for him to remain. But she sadly
                  feared that this could not be. Her little store was just about exhausted, and the
                  most she had yet been able to earn by working for the shops, was a dollar and a
                  half a week. This was not more than sufficient to buy the plainest food for her
                  little flock. It would not pay rent, nor get clothing. To meet the former,
                  recourse was had to the sale of her husband's small, select library. Careful
                  mending kept the younger children tolerably decent, and by altering for him the
                  clothes left by his father, she was able to keep Hiram in a suitable condition, to
                  appear at the store of his employer.</p>
               <p>Thus matters went on for several months. Mrs. Mayberry berry working late and
                  early. The natural result was, a gradual failure of strength. In the morning, when
                  she awoke, she would feel so languid and heavy, that to rise required a strong
                  effort, and even after she was up, and attempted to resume her labors, her
                  trembling frame almost refused to obey the dictates of her will. At length, nature
                  gave way. One morning she was so sick that she could not rise. Her head throbbed
                  with a dizzy, blinding pain—her whole body ached, and her skin burned with fever.
                  Hiram got something for the children to eat, and then taking the youngest, a
                  little girl about two years old, into the house of a neighbor who had showed them
                  some good will, asked her if she would take care of his sister until he returned
                  home at dinner time. This the neighbor readily consented to do—promising, also, to
                  call in frequently to see his mother.</p>
               <p>At dinner time Hiram found his mother quite ill. She was no better at night. For
                  three days the fever raged violently. Then, under the careful treatment of their
                  old family physician, it was subdued. After that she gradually recovered, but very
                  slowly. The physician said she must not attempt again to work as she had done.
                  This injunction was scarcely necessary. She had not the strength to do so.</p>
               <p>"I don't see what you will do, Mrs. Mayberry," a neighbor who had often aided her
                  by kind advice, said, in reply to the widows statement of her unhappy condition.
                  "You cannot maintain these children, certainly. And I don't see how, in your
                  present feeble state, you are going to maintain yourself. There is but one thing
                  that I can advise, and that advice I give with reluctance. It is to endeavor to
                  get two of your children into some orphan asylum. The youngest you may be able to
                  keep with you. The oldest can support himself at something or other."</p>
               <p>The pale cheek of Mrs. Mayberry grew paler at this proposition. She half sobbed,
                  caught her breath, and looked her adviser with a strange, bewildered stare in the
                  face.</p>
               <p>"O, no! I cannot do that! I cannot be separated from my dear little children. Who
                  will care for them like a mother?"</p>
               <p>"It is hard, I know, Mrs. Mayberry. But necessity is a stern ruler. You cannot
                  keep them with you—that is<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC5627-00000195"/> certain. You
                  have not the strength to provide them with even the coarsest food. In an asylum,
                  with a kind matron, they will be better off than under any other
                  circumstances."</p>
               <p>But Mrs. Mayberry shook her head.</p>
               <p>"No—no—no," she replied—"I cannot think of such a thing. I cannot be separated
                  from them. I shall soon be able to work again—better able than before."</p>
               <p>The neighbor who felt deeply for her, did not urge the matter. When Hiram returned
                  at dinner time, his face had in it a more animated expression than usual.</p>
               <p>"Mother," he said, as soon as he came in, "I heard today that a boy was wanted at
                  the Gazette office, who could write a good hand. The wages were to be four dollars
                  a week."</p>
               <p>"You did!" Mrs. Mayberry said, quickly, her weak frame trembling, although she
                  struggled hard to be composed.</p>
               <p>"Yes. And Mr. Easy is well acquainted with the publisher, and could get me the
                  place, I am sure."</p>
               <p>"Then go and see him at once, Hiram. If you can secure it, all will be well, if
                  not, your little brothers and sisters will have to be separated, perhaps sent to
                  an orphan asylum."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayberry covered her face with her hands and sobbed bitterly for some
                  moments.</p>
               <p>Hiram eat his frugal meal quickly, and returned to the store, where he had to
                  remain until his employer went home and dined. On his return he asked liberty to
                  be absent for half an hour, which was granted. He then went direct to the counting
                  room of Mr. Easy, and disturbed him as has been seen. Approaching with a timid
                  step, and a flushed brow, he said in a confused and hurried manner—</p>
               <p>"Mr Easy there is a lad wanted at the Gazette office."</p>
               <p>"Well?" returned Mr. Easy in no very cordial tone.</p>
               <p>"Mother thought you would be kind enough to speak to Mr. G—— for me."</p>
               <p>"Havn't you a place in a store?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir. But I don't get any wages. And at the Gazette office they will pay four
                  dollars a week."</p>
               <p>"But the knowledge of business to be gained where you are, will be worth a great
                  deal more than four dollars a week."</p>
               <p>"I know that, sir. But mother is not able to board and clothe me. I must earn
                  something."</p>
               <p>"Oh, aye, that's it. Very well, I'll see about it for you."</p>
               <p>"When shall I call, sir?" asked Hiram.</p>
               <p>"When? Oh, almost any time. Say to-morrow or next day."</p>
               <p>The lad departed, and Mr. Easy's head fell back upon the chair, the impression
                  which had been made upon his mind passing away almost as quickly as writing upon
                  water.</p>
               <p>With anxious trembling hearts did Mrs. Mayberry and her son wait for the afternoon
                  of the succeeding day. On the success of Mr. Easy's application, rested all their
                  hopes. Neither she nor Hiram eat over a few mouthfuls at dinner time. The latter
                  hurried away, and returned to the store, there to wait with trembling eagerness
                  until his employer should return from dinner, and he again be free to go and see
                  Mr. Easy.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Mayberry, the afternoon passed slowly. She had forgotten to tell her son
                  to return home immediately, if the application should be successful. He did not
                  come back, and she had, consequently, to remain in a state of anxious suspense
                  until dark. He came in at the usual hour. His dejected countenance told of
                  disappointment.</p>
               <p>"Did you see Mr. Easy?" Mrs. Mayberry asked, in a low troubled voice.</p>
               <p>"Yes. But he hadn't been to the Gazette office. He said he had been very busy. But
                  that he would see about it soon."</p>
               <p>Nothing more was said. The mother and son, after sitting silent and pensive during
                  the evening, retired early to bed. On the next day, urged on by his anxious desire
                  to get the situation of which he had heard, Hiram again called at the counting
                  room of Mr. Easy, his heart trembling with hope and fear. There were two or three
                  men present. Mr. Easy cast upon him rather an impatient look as he entered. His
                  appearance had evidently annoyed the merchant<pb n="390-391"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000196"/> chant. Had he consulted his feelings, he would have
                  retired at once. But that was too much at stake. Gliding to a corner of the room,
                  he stood, with his hat in his hand, and a look of anxiety upon his face, until Mr.
                  Easy was disengaged. At length the gentlemen with whom he was occupied went away,
                  and Mr. Easy turned towards the boy. Hiram looked up earnestly in his face.</p>
               <p>"I have really been so much occupied my lad," the merchant said, in a kind of
                  apologetic tone, "as to have entirely forgotten my promise to you. But I will see
                  about it. Come in again, to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Hiram made no answer, but turned with a sigh towards the door. The keen
                  disappointment expressed in the boy's face, and the touching quietness of his
                  manner, reached the feelings of Mr. Easy. He was not a hard hearted man, but
                  selfishly indifferent to others. He could feel deeply enough if he would permit
                  himself to do so. But of this latter failing he was not often guilty.</p>
               <p>"Stop a minute," he said. And then stood in a musing attitude for a moment or two.
                  "As you seem so anxious about this matter," he added, "if you will wait here a
                  little while, I will step down to see Mr. G—— at once."</p>
               <p>The boy's face brightened instantly. Mr. Easy saw the effect of what he said, and
                  it made the task he was about entering upon reluctantly, an easy one. The boy
                  waited for nearly a quarter of an hour, so eager to know the result that he could
                  not compose himself to sit down. The sound of Mr. Easy's step at the door at
                  length made his heart bound. The merchant entered. Hiram looked into his face. One
                  glance was sufficient to dash every dearly cherished hope to the ground.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry," Mr. Easy said, "but the place was filled this morning. I was a
                  little too late."</p>
               <p>The boy was unable to control his feelings. The disappointment was too great.
                  Tears gushed from his eyes, as he turned away and left the counting-room without
                  speaking.</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid I've done wrong," said Mr. Easy to himself, as he stood, in a musing
                  attitude, by his desk, about five minutes after Hiram had left. "If I had seen
                  about the situation when he first called upon me, I might have secured it for him.
                  But it's too late now."</p>
               <p>After saying this the merchant placed his thumbs in the arm-holes of his
                  waistcoat, and commenced walking the floor of his counting room backwards and
                  forwards. He could not get out of his mind the image of the boy as he turned from
                  him in tears, nor drive away thoughts of the friend's widow whom he had neglected.
                  This state of mind continued all the afternoon. Its natural effect was to cause
                  him to cast about in his mind for some way of getting employment for Hiram that
                  would yield immediate returns. But nothing presented itself.</p>
               <p>"I wonder if I couldn't make room for him here?" he at length said—"He looks like
                  a bright boy. I know Mr. —— is highly pleased with him. He spoke of getting four
                  dollars a week. That's a good deal to give to a mere lad. But, I suppose I might
                  make him worth that to me. And now I begin to think seriously about the matter, I
                  believe I cannot keep a clear conscience and any longer remain indifferent to the
                  welfare of my old friend's widow and children. I must look after them a little
                  more closely than I have heretofore done."</p>
               <p>This resolution relieved the mind of Mr. Easy a good deal.</p>
               <p>When Hiram left the counting room of the merchant, his spirits were crushed to the
                  very earth. He found his way back, how he hardly knew, to his place of business,
                  and mechanically performed the tasks allotted him, until evening.</p>
               <p>Then he returned home, reluctant to meet his mother, and yet anxious to relieve
                  her state of suspense, even, if in doing so, he should dash a last hope from her
                  heart. When he came in Mrs. Mayberry lifted her eyes to his, inquiringly; but
                  dropped them instantly—she needed no words to tell her that he had suffered a
                  bitter disappointment.</p>
               <p>"You did not get the place?" she at length said, with forced composure.</p>
               <p>"No—It was taken this morning. Mr. Easy promised to see about it. But he didn't do
                  so. When he went this afternoon, it was too late."</p>
               <p>Hiram said this with a trembling voice and lips that quivered.</p>
               <p>"Thy will be done!" murmured the widow, lifting her<pb n="392-393"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000197"/> eyes upwards. "If these tender ones are to be taken
                  from their mother's fold, oh, do thou temper for them the piercing blast, and be
                  their shelter amid the raging tempests."</p>
               <p>A tap at the door brought back the thoughts of Mrs. Mayberry. A brief struggle
                  with her feelings enabled her to overcome them in time to receive a visitor with
                  composure. It was the merchant.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Easy!" she said in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Mayberry, how do you do!" There was some restraint and embarrassment in his
                  manner. He was conscious of having neglected the widow of his friend, before he
                  came. The humble condition in which he found her, quickened that consciousness
                  into a sting.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, madam," he said after he had become seated and made a few inquiries,
                  "that I did not get the place for your son. In fact, I am to blame in the matter.
                  But, I have been thinking since that he would suit me exactly, and if you have no
                  objections, I will take him and pay him a salary of two hundred dollars for the
                  first year."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayberry tried to reply, but her feelings were too much excited by this
                  sudden and unlooked for proposal, to allow her to speak for some moments. Even
                  then her assent was made with tears glistening on her cheeks.</p>
               <p>Arrangements were quickly made for the transfer of Hiram from the store where he
                  had been engaged, to the counting room of Mr. Easy. The salary he received was
                  just enough to enable Mrs. Mayberry, with what she herself earned, to keep her
                  little together, until Hiram, who proved a valuable assistant in Mr. Easy's
                  business, could command a larger salary, and render her more important hid.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>THE FIERY TRIAL.</head>
               <p>"THE amount of that bill, if you please, sir."</p>
               <p>The man thus unceremoniously addressed, lifted his eyes from the ledger, over
                  which he had been bending for the last six hours, with scarcely the relaxation of
                  a moment, and exhibited a pale, care-worn countenance—and, though still young, a
                  head over which were thickly scattered the silver tokens of age. A sad smile
                  played over his intelligent features, a smile meant to shake the sternness of the
                  man who was troubling his peace, as he replied in a low, calm voice—</p>
               <p>"To-day, it will be impossible, sir."</p>
               <p>"And how many times have you given me the same answer. I cannot waste my time by
                  calling day after day, for so paltry a sum."</p>
               <p>A flush passed over the fine countenance of the man thus rudely addressed. But he
                  replied in the same low tone, which now slightly trembled:</p>
               <p>"I would not ask you to call, sir, if I had the money But what I have not, I
                  cannot give."</p>
               <p>"And pray when <emph>will</emph> you have the money?" The man paused for some
                  time, evidently calculating the future, and after a long-drawn sigh, as if
                  disappointed with the result, said:—</p>
               <p>"It will be two or three months, before I can pay it and even then, it will depend
                  on a contingency."</p>
               <p>"Two or three months?—a contingency? It must come quicker and surer than that,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>"That is the best I can say."</p>
               <p>"But not the best I can do, I hope.—Good-morning." After the collector had gone,
                  the man bent his head down, until his face rested even upon the ponderous volume
                  over which he had been poring for hours. He thought, and thought, but thought
                  brought no relief. The<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC5627-00000198"/> most he could
                  earn was ten dollars a week, and for his children, two sweet babes, and for the
                  comfort of a sick wife, he had to expend the full sum of his wages. The debt for
                  which he was now troubled, was a rent-bill of forty dollars, held against him by a
                  man whose annual income was twenty thousand dollars. Finally, he concluded to go
                  and see Mr. Moneylove, and try to prevail upon him to stop any proceedings that
                  the collector might institute against him. In the evening, he sought the dwelling
                  of his rich creditor, and after being ushered into his splendid parlour, waited
                  with a troubled heart for his appearance. Mr. Moneylove entered.</p>
               <p>"How do you do, sir?"</p>
               <p>"How do you do?" replied the debtor, in a low, troubled voice. The manner of Mr.
                  Moneylove changed, the moment he heard the peculiar tone of his voice, although he
                  did not know him. There was an appealing language in its cadence that whispered a
                  warning to his ear, and he closed his heart on the instant.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," were his next words, "what is your will?"</p>
               <p>"You hold a bill against me for rent."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, go to my agent."</p>
               <p>"I have seen Mr. ——."</p>
               <p>"That will do, sir. He knows all about my business, and will arrange to my entire
                  satisfaction."</p>
               <p>"But, sir, I cannot pay it now, and he threatens harsh measures."</p>
               <p>"I have entire confidence in his judgment, sir, and am willing to leave all such
                  matters to his discretion."</p>
               <p>"I am in trouble, sir, and in poverty beside, for the demands on me are greater
                  than I can meet."</p>
               <p>"Your own fault, I suppose," retorted the landlord, with a sneer. "That, any one
                  might know, who took half a glance at you."</p>
               <p>This remark caused the blood to mount suddenly to the face of the man.</p>
               <p>"Let me be judged by what I am, not by what I have been," was the meek reply,
                  after the troubled pause of a few moments. Then in a more decided tone of voice,
                  he said:—</p>
               <p>"Will you not interfere?"</p>
               <p>"Will I? <emph>No!</emph> I never interfere with my agent. He gives me entire
                  satisfaction, and while he does so, I shall not interfere." And Mr. Moneylove
                  smiled with self-satisfaction at the idea of his careful and thrifty agent, and
                  his own worldly policy.</p>
               <p>The petitioner slowly left the house—murmuring to himself: "<hi rend="i"/>Forgive
                  us our debts as we forgive our debtors." It was more than an hour before he could
                  compose his mind sufficiently to be able to meet his wife with a countenance that
                  was not too deeply shadowed with care.</p>
               <p>She was ill, and besides, under the pressure of many causes, was suffering from a
                  nervous lowness of spirits. Against this depression, her husband saw that she was
                  striving with all the mental energy she possessed, but striving almost in vain. To
                  know that she even had cause for the exercise of such an internal power, was, to
                  him, painful in the extreme; and he was bitter in his self-reproaches for being
                  the cause of suffering to one he loved with a pure and fervent love.</p>
               <p>Turning, at last, resolutely towards his dwelling, and striving with a strong
                  effort to keep down the troubles that were sweeping in rough waves over his
                  spirit; it was not long before he set his foot upon his own doorstone.</p>
               <p>To give force to this scene, and to throw around what follows its true interest,
                  it will be necessary to go back and sketch some things in the history of the
                  individual here introduced.</p>
               <p>His name was Theodore Wilmer. In earlier years, he was clerk in the large
                  mercantile house of Rensselaer, Wykoff &amp; Co., in New York. Being a young man
                  of intelligence, good address, and good principles, he was much esteemed, and
                  valued by his employers, who took some pains to introduce him into society. In
                  this way he was brought into contact with some of the first families in New York,
                  and, in this way, he became acquainted with Constance Jackson, the daughter of a
                  wealthy merchant. Constance was truly a lovely girl, and one for whom Theodore
                  soon began to entertain feelings akin to love.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson, (the father of Constance,) was the son of a man who had begun life in
                  New York, at the very bottom<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC5627-00000199"/> tom of
                  fortune's wheel. He was a native of Ireland, and came to this country very poor.
                  For some years, with his pack on his back, he gained a subsistence by vending
                  dry-goods, and unimportant trifles, through the counties and small towns in the
                  vicinity of New York. Gradually he laid up dollar after dollar, until he was able
                  to open a very small shop in Maiden Lane, a kind of thread-and-needle store.
                  Careful in his purchases, and constant in his attendance on business, he soon
                  began to find his tens counting hundreds; and but few years rolled away, before
                  his hundreds began to grow into thousands. After a while he took a larger store,
                  and suddenly became known. and respected as "a merchant." At the end of twenty
                  years from the time he carried his pack out of New York, he could write himself
                  worth fifty thousand dollars. Success continued to crown his efforts in business,
                  and when his children came on the stage of active life, they were raised to
                  consider themselves as far superior to mere mechanics, or those who had to labour
                  for their daily bread.</p>
               <p>The father of Constance was the eldest son of old Mr. Jackson, and inherited from
                  him a large share of haughty pride. His wife was out of a family with notions
                  equally aristocratic. Constance was their only child, and they had bestowed no
                  little care in endeavouring to make her the most accomplished young lady in New
                  York. They loved her tenderly, but pride divided with affection their interest in
                  her. She had already declined the hands of two young men of the first families in
                  the city, much to the displeasure of both her parents, when she met Theodore
                  Wilmer, who resided in the family of Mr. Wykoff, partner in the house that
                  employed the young man in the capacity of clerk. In this family, Constance visited
                  regularly, and the intimacy which sprung up between the young couple, had a chance
                  of maturing into a more permanent affection, before Mr. or Mrs. Jackson had the
                  slightest suspicion of such an event. Indeed, the first knowledge they had of the
                  real state of affairs was obtained through Wilmer himself, in the form of an
                  application for the hand of their daughter. It was made to Mr. Jackson, on whom it
                  fell with the unexpected suddenness of a flash from a clear sky in June.</p>
               <p>"And pray, sir, who are you?" was his hasty and excited answer.</p>
               <p>"Theodore Wilmer, clerk in the house of Rensselaer, Wykoff &amp; Co."</p>
               <p>"Are you really in earnest, young man?" said Mr. Jackson, in a calmer voice,
                  though his lips trembled with suppressed anger.</p>
               <p>"Never more so in my life, sir."</p>
               <p>"And does my daughter know of this application?"</p>
               <p>"She does."</p>
               <p>"And is it made by her consent?"</p>
               <p>"Of course."</p>
               <p>The calm, and "of course" manner of the young man was more than the patience of
                  Jackson could withstand. Hardly able to contain the indignation that swelled
                  within him, at the presumption of an unknown clerk, thus to ask the hand of his
                  daughter, he paused but a moment, and then seizing Wilmer by the shoulder, and
                  looking him steadily in the face, while he almost foamed with anger, replied thus
                  to his last admission:—</p>
               <p>"If that headstrong girl has dared to place her thoughts on you, obscure
                  underling! and dared, as you say, to consent to accept you, I will cut her off
                  this hour from fortune and affection. I will cast her loose upon the world as
                  unworthy. Go—go—and never presume to come again into my presence!"</p>
               <p>Opposition, denial, he had expected; but nothing like this. He had hoped that when
                  the parents saw a fixed resolution on the part of Constance to accept none other,
                  that gradually opposition would be worn away. Such a termination he now saw to be
                  hopeless. The father did not seek an immediate interview with his child. Before
                  meeting her, he had found time to reflect upon the real position of affairs. He
                  was well enough taught in the theory, at least, of a woman's affections. He had
                  heard of instances where opposition in a love affair had only added fuel to the
                  flame; and one or two such cases had fallen under his own eye. He, therefore,
                  decided to make no present show of opposition, and on no consideration to allow
                  her to know of the interview that had occurred between her lover and himself. Mrs.
                  Jackson, entering into her husband's view and feelings,<pb n="398-399"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000200"/> took upon herself the task of watching and silently
                  controlling all the movements of her daughter. Particular care was taken to
                  prevent her visiting the family of Mr Wykoff.</p>
               <p>"Where are you going, love?" said her mother, to her the next day after that of
                  the interview, as Constance came out of her room, dressed for a walk.</p>
               <p>"I promised to walk with Laura Wykoff, ma, and am going to call for her."</p>
               <p>"I was just going to send for you to dress for a walk with me; I want to make a
                  call to-day on Madame Boyer. And this afternoon I am to spend with Mrs. Claxton
                  and her five daughters, and you must go along, of course. So you will have to
                  postpone your walk with Laura today."</p>
               <p>If it had only been the walk with Laura Wykoff, Constance would not have hesitated
                  a moment, but her heart almost ached with suspense to know from Theodore the
                  result of his interview with her father. He had promised to leave a note for her
                  with Laura, who was their mutual confidante. The mother, of course, noticed an air
                  of regret at her disappointment, and ingeniously remarked—</p>
               <p>"So you would rather walk with Miss Wykoff, than your mother?"</p>
               <p>The tears started into the eyes of Constance, and twining her arms around the neck
                  of her mother, she murmured,</p>
               <p>"No, no, dear mother! How could you think so?"</p>
               <p>Hiding her anxious desire to know the result of that interview upon which hung her
                  fate, she passed with apparent cheerfulness through the weary day; and late at
                  night sought her pillow from which sleep had fled. On the next morning, much to
                  her distress of mind, she learned that a visit of a few weeks to a relation in
                  Albany had been suddenly determined upon, and that in company with her mother she
                  had to set off in the first boat that day. Her suspicions were at once roused as
                  to the real cause for this hasty movement, and she determined to write to Theodore
                  immediately on her arrival at Albany.</p>
               <p>The beautiful scenery of the Hudson was unappreciated by one eye of the many
                  brilliant ones that looked out from the majestic boat, that, in the language of
                  Carlyle, "travelled on fire-wings," through the looming highlands. The watchful
                  mother strove hard to divert the mind of her child, but in vain. Her heart was
                  away from the present reality; and no effort of her own could bring it back. It
                  was night when the boat arrived, and no chance offered for writing before retiring
                  to bed. It seemed, indeed, as if the mother, suspicious that some communication
                  would be made in this way, kept so about Constance all the next day, that she had
                  no chance of dropping Theodore even a line to say where she was, and that she
                  still remembered him with affection. And the next day passed in the same way; not
                  an hour, not a moment could she get for privacy or uninterrupted self-communion.
                  At last she determined to write to Laura Wykoff, to which, of course, her mother
                  could make no objection. But she dared not mention the name of Theodore, or allude
                  to her present restrained condition, except remotely, for fear that her mother
                  would ask to see the letter. This letter was given to a servant to convey to the
                  post-office, in the presence of her mother. It never reached its destination. And
                  the mother knew well the reason why. In it, she asked an immediate answer. Day
                  after day passed, and no answer came. She wrote again, and with the same success.
                  Finally, she gained a few minutes to pen a line or two to Theodore, which she
                  concealed, suspecting that there was something wrong about the transmission of the
                  letters, until a chance offered for having it certainly placed in the right
                  channel of conveyance. This note reached Theodore, and removed a mountain from his
                  feelings. He had learned of her hasty journey to Albany, but this was all he could
                  ascertain, and suspecting the cause, his mind was in a state of racking and
                  painful suspense.</p>
               <p>Day after day passed, until a month had expired, and still there was no indication
                  of a movement to return home. Once or twice a week her father would come up from
                  New York, and to the persuasions of the relatives at whose house they were
                  visiting, half-consented that Constance and her mother should stay all summer.
                  Finally, it was decided, that Albany should be their place of residence for some
                  months.</p>
               <pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC5627-00000201"/>
               <p>Things assuming this decided appearance, Constance now set herself resolutely to
                  work to circumvent her mother's careful surveillance. It was the first time in her
                  life that she had seriously determined to act towards the parent she had so long
                  and so tenderly loved, with duplicity. All at once she became more cheerful, and
                  seemed to enter with a joyful spirit into every plan proposed for spending the
                  time pleasantly. With a sprightly cousin, a young girl of her own age, she
                  cultivated a close intimacy, and finding her somewhat romantic and independent,
                  finally confided to her the secret that was wearing into her heart from
                  concealment. Readily did Ellen Raymond enter into the scheme she at last proposed,
                  which was to write to Theodore, and give the letter into her charge. It was
                  promptly conveyed to the post-office. Theodore was directed to address Ellen, and
                  in the envelope to enclose a letter for Constance. On the third day, the young
                  ladies took a walk, and in their way called at the post-office. A letter was
                  handed out to Ellen, and on breaking the seal, another appeared addressed to
                  Constance. She did not dare to open it in the street, but retired to a
                  confectioner's, and while Ellen was tasting an ice-cream, Constance was devouring,
                  with eager eyes, the first love-token she had ever received from Theodore
                  Wilmer.</p>
               <p>This was the beginning of a correspondence which was regularly kept up through the
                  summer, of all of which both father and mother remained profoundly ignorant. They
                  were delighted to see their daughter so soon recover from the first deep
                  depression of spirits which was occasioned by their sudden removal from New York,
                  but little suspected the cause. Less and less carefully did the mother watch her
                  daughter, and more frequently were the two young friends alone in their chambers,
                  even for hours together. Such times were not spent idly by Constance. Thus the
                  very means—separation—resorted to by Mr. Jackson and his wife, to wean the mind of
                  their daughter from the "low-born" Wilmer, only proved, from not having been
                  thoroughly carried out, that which bound them together in heart for ever. Give two
                  lovers, pen, ink, and paper, and their love will defy time and distance. The
                  thousand expressed fond regards, and weariness of absence, endear each to each;
                  and imagination, from affection, invests each with new and undiscovered
                  perfections. Three months had passed away since the hasty journey from New York,
                  and supposing Constance to be thoroughly weaned from her foolish preference for a
                  poor clerk, for she was now cheerful, and expressed no wish to return—the parents
                  proposed to go back to the city. Preparation was accordingly made, and in a few
                  days Constance found herself, with a yearning desire to get home again, gliding
                  swiftly along the smooth surface of the Hudson. She had not failed to inform
                  Theodore of her return, and as the boat swept up to the wharf, her quick eye
                  caught his eager face bending over towards her. A glance of glad, and yet painful
                  recognition passed between them, and in the next moment he had disappeared in the
                  living mass of human beings. For some time she was closely watched; but she
                  carefully lulled suspicion, and at last succeeded in managing to get short and
                  stolen interviews with Wilmer. Their first meeting was at a young friend's, to
                  whom she had confided her secret: this was not Laura Wykoff, for her mother had
                  managed to fall out with her family, so as to have a good plea for denying to
                  Constance the privilege of visiting her. Regularly did the lovers meet, about once
                  every week, at this friend's; and, encouraged by her, they finally took the
                  hazardous and decisive step of getting married clandestinely.</p>
               <p>Three days after this event, Wilmer entered the store of the merchants in whose
                  service he had been for years, for the purpose of resuming his regular duties
                  which had been briefly interrupted. He was met by the senior partner, with a
                  manner that chilled him to the heart.</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Wykoff in?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"No," was the cold reply.</p>
               <p>"He has not left town?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. He went to New Orleans yesterday, and will not return for two or three
                  months."</p>
               <p>"Did he leave a letter for me?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>Then came an embarrassing silence of some moments which was broken by Wilmer's
                  saying—</p>
               <pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC5627-00000202"/>
               <p>"I suppose that I can resume my duties, as usual?"</p>
               <p>"We have supplied your place," was the answer to this.</p>
               <p>Quick as thought, the young man turned away, and left the store, his mind all in
                  confusion. In marrying Constance in opposition to her parents' wishes, he did so
                  with a feeling of pride in the internal power, and external facilities, which he
                  possessed for rising rapidly in the world, and showing ere long to old Mr.
                  Jackson, that he could stand upon an equal social eminence with himself. How
                  suddenly was this feeling of proud confidence dashed to the earth! The external
                  facilities upon which he had based his anticipations were to be found in the
                  friendship and ample means of the house of Rensselaer, Wykoff &amp; Co. That
                  friendship had been suddenly withdrawn, evidently in strong disapprobation of what
                  he had done.</p>
               <p>As he turned away, and walked slowly along, he knew not and scarcely cared
                  whither, a feeling of deep despondency took possession of his mind. From a proud
                  consciousness of ability to rise rapidly in the world, and show to the friends of
                  Constance that she had not chosen one really beneath her, he sunk into that gloomy
                  and depressing state of mind in which we experience a painful inability to do
                  anything, while deeply sensible that unusual efforts are required at our hands.
                  The thought of not being able to lift his wife above the obscure condition in
                  which he must now inevitably remain, at least for a long time, seemed as if it
                  would drive him mad. Passing slowly along, wrapped thus in gloomy meditations, he
                  was suddenly aroused by a hand upon his arm, and a cheerful voice, saying—</p>
               <p>"Give us your hand, Theodore! Here's a hearty shake, and a hearty congratulation
                  at the same time! Run off with that purse—proud old curmudgeon's daughter Ha! ha!
                  I like you for that! You're a man of mettle. But, halloo! What's the matter? You
                  look as grave as a barn-door, on the shady side. Not repenting, already, I
                  hope?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Henry, I am repenting of that rash act from the very bottom of my
                  heart."</p>
               <p>"O, no! Don't talk in that way, Theodore. Constance is one of the sweetest girls
                  in the city, and will make you a lovely wife. There are hundreds who envy
                  you."</p>
               <p>"They need not; for this is the most wretched hour of my life."</p>
               <p>"Why, what in the world is the matter, Wilmer?" his friend replied to this. "You
                  look as if you had buried instead of married a wife. But come, you want a glass of
                  something to revive you. Let us step in here. I am a little dry myself."</p>
               <p>Without hesitation or reply, Wilmer entered a drinking-house, with the young man,
                  where they retired to a box, and ordered brandy and water. After this had been
                  taken in silence, the friend, whose name was Wilbert Arnold, said—</p>
               <p>"The state of mind in which I find you, Theodore, surprises and pains me greatly.
                  If it is not trespassing too far upon private matters, I should like very much to
                  know the reason. I ask, because I feel now, and always have felt, much interest in
                  you."</p>
               <p>It was some time before Wilmer replied to this. At length, he said—</p>
               <p>"The cause of my present state of mind is of such recent occurrence, and I have
                  become so bewildered in consequence of it, that I can scarcely rally my thoughts
                  sufficiently to reply to your kind inquiries. Suffice it to say, that, in
                  consequence, I presume, of my having run off with Mr. Jackson's daughter, I have
                  lost a good situation, and the best of friends. I am, therefore, thrown upon the
                  world at this very crisis, like a sailor cast upon the ocean, with but a plank to
                  sustain himself, and keep his head above the waves. When I married Miss Jackson,
                  it was with the resolution to rise rapidly, and show to the world that she had not
                  chosen thoughtlessly. Of course, I expected the aid of Rensselaer, Wykoff &amp;
                  Co. Their uniform kindness towards me seemed a sure guarantee for this aid. But
                  the result has been, not only their estrangement from me, but my dismissal from
                  their service. And now, what to do, or where to turn myself, I do not know. Really
                  I feel desperate!"</p>
               <p>"That is bad, truly," Arnold rejoined, musingly, after Wilmer had ceased speaking.
                  Then ringing a little hand-bell that stood upon the table, he ordered the waiter,
                     was<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC5627-00000203"/> obeyed the summons, to bring
                  some more brandy. Nothing further was said until the brandy was served, of which
                  both of the young men partook freely.</p>
               <p>"What do you intend doing?" Arnold at length asked, looking his friend in the
                  face.</p>
               <p>"I wish you would answer that question for me, for it's more than I can do," was
                  the gloomy response.</p>
               <p>"You must endeavour to rise in the world. It will never do to bring Constance down
                  to the comparatively mean condition in which a clerk with a small salary is
                  compelled to live."</p>
               <p>"That I know, too well. But how am I to prevent it? That is what drives me almost
                  beside myself."</p>
               <p>"You must hit upon some expedient for making money fast."</p>
               <p>"I know of no honest expedients."</p>
               <p>"I think that I do."</p>
               <p>"Name one."</p>
               <p>"Do you know Hardville?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"He came as near failure as could possibly be, last week."</p>
               <p>"He did?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And how did he get through?"</p>
               <p>"It is the answer to that question which I wish you to consider. He was saved from
                  ruin in the last extremity, and by what some would call a desperate expedient.
                  Your case is a desperate one, and, if you would save yourself, you must resort to
                  desperate expedients, likewise."</p>
               <p>"Name the expedient."</p>
               <p>"Hardville had one thousand dollars to pay, more than he could possibly raise. He
                  tried everywhere, but to no purpose. He could neither borrow nor collect that sum.
                  In a moment of desperation, he put one hundred dollars into his pocket, and went
                  to a regular establishment near here, and staked that sum at play. In two hours he
                  came away with twelve hundred dollars in his pocket, instead of one hundred. And
                  thus he was saved from ruin."</p>
               <p>When Arnold ceased speaking, Wilmer looked him in the face with a steady, stern,
                  half-angry look, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>"Try another glass of this brandy," the former said, pouring out a pretty liberal
                  supply for each. Mechanically, Wilmer put the glass to his lips, and turned off
                  the contents.</p>
               <p>"Well, what do you think of that plan?" asked the friend, after each had sat
                  musing for some time.</p>
               <p>"I am not a gambler!" was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Of course not. But your case, as I said, and as you admit, is a desperate one;
                  and requires desperate remedies. The fact of your going to a regular
                  establishment, and gaining there, in an honourable way, something, as a capital to
                  begin with, does not make you a gambler. After you have got a start, you needn't
                  go there any more. And all you want is a start. Give you that, and, my word for
                  it, you will make your way in the world with the best of them."</p>
               <p>"O, yes! Give me a start, as you say, and I'll go ahead as fast as anybody. Give
                  me that start, and I'll show old Mr. Jackson in a few years that I can count
                  dollars with him all day."</p>
               <p>"Exactly. And that start you must have. Now, how are you going to get it, unless
                  in the way that I suggest?"</p>
               <p>"I am not so sure that I can get it in that way."</p>
               <p>"I am, then. Only make the trial. You owe it to your wife to do so. For her sake,
                  then, let me urge you to act promptly and efficiently."</p>
               <p>Thus tempted, while his mind was greatly obscured by the strong potations he had
                  taken, Theodore Wilmer began to waver. It did not seem half so wrong, nor half so
                  disgraceful, to play for money, as it did at first. Finally, he agreed to meet his
                  friend that evening, and get introduced to some one of the many gambling
                  establishments that infest all large cities.</p>
               <p>A reaction in his feelings now took place. The elation of mind caused by the
                  brandy, made him confident of success. He saw before him a rapid elevation to
                  wealth and standing in society, and, consequently, a rapid restoration of
                  Constance to the circle in which she had moved.</p>
               <p>Before marriage, he had rented a handsome house, and had it furnished in very good
                  style, upon means which he<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC5627-00000204"/> had
                  prudently saved from a liberal salary. Into this, he at once introduced his young
                  wife, who had already begun to feel her heart yearning for her mother's voice, and
                  her mother's smile. One young friend had been with her all the morning, but had
                  left towards the middle of the day Alone, for the first time, since her hurried
                  marriage, her feelings became somewhat saddened in their hue. But as the hour
                  approached for her husband to come home, those feelings gate place, in a degree,
                  to an ardent desire for his return, the result of deep and fervent love for him.
                  She had sat for some moments, expecting to hear him at the door, when the bell
                  rung, and she started to her feet, and stood on the floor, ready to spring forward
                  the moment he should enter the room. No one, however, came in, and her heart sunk
                  in her bosom with the disappointment. In a moment after, the servant handed her a
                  note, the seal of which she broke hastily. It was from her husband, and ran
                  thus:—</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"DEAR CONSTANCE:—An accumulation of business in my absence so presses
                              upon me now, that I cannot possibly come so great a distance to
                              dinner, at least for this day. It may likewise keep me away until
                              eight or nine o'clock this evening. But keep a good heart, dear; our
                              meeting will be pleasanter for the long absence—Adieu,</p>
                           <closer>
                              <signed>THEODORE."</signed>
                           </closer>
                        </div>

                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>The note dropped from her hand, and she sank into a chair, overcome with a feeling
                  of strong disappointment. To wait until eight or nine o'clock in the evening,
                  before she should see him, when the morning had appeared lengthened to a day! O,
                  it seemed as if she could not endure the wearisome interval!</p>
               <p>As for Wilmer, the truth was, he found himself so much under the influence of the
                  liberal quantity of brandy which he had taken, that he dared not go home to
                  Constance. He would not have appeared before her as he was, for the world. It was
                  under the consciousness of his condition, that he wrote the billet, which his
                  young wife had received. After doing so, he went to bed at a public house, and
                  slept until towards evening. When he awoke, Arnold was sitting in the chamber.
                  Some feelings of bitter regret for the pains which his absence must have caused
                  his young wife, passed through his mind, as he aroused himself. These were soon
                  drowned by a few glasses of wine, which his friend had already ordered to be sent
                  up. That friend, let it here be remarked, was not a professed gambler—nor had he
                  any sinister designs in urging on Wilmer as he was doing. But he was a man of
                  loose morals, and, therefore, really believed that he was doing him a service in
                  urging him to make an effort to get upon his feet by means of the gambling-table.
                  Knowing the young man's high-toned feelings—and how utterly he must, from his
                  character, condemn anything like play, he had purposely sought to obscure his
                  perceptions by inducing him to drink freely. In this, he had succeeded.</p>
               <p>As soon as night had thrown her dark shadows over the city, the two young men took
                  their steps towards one of those haunts, known, too appropriately, by the name of
                  "hells." At eight o'clock, Theodore went in, with two hundred dollars in his
                  pocket—all the money he possessed;—and at ten o'clock, came out penniless.</p>
               <p>Lonely and long was the afternoon to the young bride, giving opportunity to many
                  thoughts of a sober, and even saddening nature. Evening came at last, and then
                  night with its deeper gloom. Eight o'clock arrived, and nine, but her husband did
                  not return. And then the minutes slowly passed, until the clock struck ten.</p>
               <p>"O, where can he be!" Constance ejaculated, rising to her feet, and beginning to
                  pace the room to and fro, pausing every moment to listen to the sound of passing
                  footsteps. Thus she continued for the space of something like half an hour, when
                  she sunk exhausted upon a chair. It was twelve o'clock when he at length came in.
                  As he opened the door, his young wife sprung to his side, exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"O, Theodore! Theodore! Why have you staid away so very long?"</p>
               <p>As she said this, he staggered against her, almost throwing her over, and then
                  passed on to the parlors without a word in return to her earnest and affectionate
                  greeting.</p>
               <p>Poor Constance was stunned for the moment. But she quickly recovered, her woman's
                  heart nerving itself involuntarily, and followed after her husband. He had<pb
                     n="408-409" xml:id="VAC5627-00000205"/> thrown himself upon a sofa, and sat,
                  half-reclining, with his head upon his bosom.</p>
               <p>"Are you sick, dear Theodore?" his young wife asked, in a tone of deep and earnest
                  affection, laying her hand upon him, and bending down and kissing his
                  forehead.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am sick, Constance," was the half-stupid reply—</p>
               <p>"Come, then, let me assist you up to bed. A good night's rest will do you good,"
                  she said, gently urging him to rise.</p>
               <p>She understood perfectly his condition. She knew that it was intoxication. But
                  while it pained her young heart deeply, it awoke in her bosom no feelings of
                  alarm. She felt convinced that it was the result of accident, and had no
                  expectation of ever again seeing its recurrence. She asked him if he were sick, to
                  spare him the mortification of knowing that she perceived the true nature of his
                  indisposition.</p>
               <p>Thus urged, he at once arose, and supported by the weak arm of his young wife,
                  slowly ascended the stairs, and entered his chamber. It was not many minutes
                  before his senses were locked in profound slumber.</p>
               <p>Not so, however, Constance. The earnestness with which she had looked for evening
                  to come, that she might again see the face, and hear the voice of her husband, had
                  greatly excited her mind. This excitement was increased by the condition in which
                  he had so unexpectedly returned. The effect was, to keep her awake, in spite of
                  strong efforts to sink away into sleep. Many sad and desponding thoughts forced
                  themselves upon her, as she lay, hour after hour, in a state of half-waking
                  consciousness. It was nearly day-dawn, when, from all this, she found relief in a
                  deep slumber.</p>
               <p>The next day was one of heart-aching reflections to Theodore Wilmer. In his eager,
                  but half-insane effort to elevate himself rapidly for the sake of his young wife,
                  he had sunk into actual want, and not only forfeited his own self-respect, but
                  degraded himself, he felt, in the eyes of her whose love was dearer to him than
                  life.</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The events of two years must now be passed over, with but a brief notice. There
                  will be enough in the after history of Wilmer and his young wife, to awaken the
                  reader's keenest sympathies, without unveiling the particular incidents of this
                  period.</p>
               <p>Suffice it, then, to say,—that the first night's experience at the gambling-table
                  was not enough to satisfy Wilmer, that it was neither the right way, nor the most
                  successful way of elevating himself in the world. So anxious did he feel on
                  account of Constance, that be borrowed money of his false friend Arnold, on the
                  evening of the very next day, and after drinking, freely, to nerve himself up,
                  sought again the gambling-table. At ten o'clock, he left, the winner by fifty
                  dollars. He left thus early on account of his wife, who would be, he knew,
                  anxiously looking for his return. This encouraged him to go on, and he did go on.
                  But he could never feel sanguine of success, or be able to still the troubled
                  whispers within, until he had drunken freely. Of course, he was every day more or
                  less under the influence of liquor. For a year, he managed, in this way, to keep
                  up the style of living in which he had commenced, but he could get nothing ahead.
                  None could imagine how this was done, for the young man was exceedingly cautious.
                  He looked to some good turn of fortune by which he should be enabled to abandon
                  for ever a course of life that he hated and despised. No such lucky turn, however,
                  met his anxious expectations. After the first year of this course of life, his
                  health, which had never been very good, began rapidly to fail. His cheeks became
                  hollow, and a racking cough began to show itself. Still he went on keeping late
                  hours, and drinking more and more freely, while his mind was all the time upon the
                  rack. Towards the close of the second year, he was taken down with a severe
                  illness, the result of all this abuse of mind and body. He lingered long upon the
                  brink of the grave; but the little energy which his system retained, rallied at
                  last, and he began slowly to recover. During convalescence, he had full time for
                  reflection. For full two years, he had been almost constantly so much under the
                  influence of brandy, as really to be unable to think rationally upon any subject,
                  and he had, in consequence, pursued a course of life, injurious, both to his own
                  moral and physical health, and to the happiness of her for whom he would, at any
                  moment of<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC5627-00000206"/> that time, have sacrificed
                  everything, even life itself. In rising from that bed of sickness, it was with a
                  solemn vow never again to enter a gaming-house, and never again to touch the
                  bewildering poison that had been the secondary, if not, indeed, the primary cause
                  of two years' folly—nay, madness.</p>
               <p>And Constance, what of her, all that time? the reader asks. It would be a
                  difficult task to give even a feeble idea of all she patiently endured, and of all
                  she suffered. Not once in that long period did she either see, or hear from her
                  parents. Three or four times had she written to them, but no answer was returned.
                  At last she ventured under the yearning anxiety that she felt once more to see her
                  mother, and to hear the voice that lingered in her memory like old familiar music
                  to go to her, and ask her forgiveness and her love. But she was coldly and cruelly
                  repulsed—not even being permitted to gain her mother's presence.</p>
               <p>In regard to her husband, her love was like a deep, pure stream. Its course was
                  never troubled by passion, or obstructed in its onward course. Though he would
                  come home often and often in a state of stupor from drink—though it was rarely
                  earlier than midnight when he returned to make glad with his presence her watching
                  and waiting heart, she never felt a reproaching thought. And to her, his words and
                  tones, and manner, were ever full of tenderness. Deeply did he love her—and for
                  her sake more than for his own, was he struggling thus against a powerful current
                  daily exhausting his strength, without moving onward.</p>
               <p>Thus much, briefly, of those two years of toil, and struggle, and pain. On
                  recovering, with a shattered constitution, from the serious attack of illness that
                  had resulted from the abuse of himself during that period, Wilmer felt compelled
                  to give up his fondly-cherished ideas of rising with Constance to the position
                  from which he had dragged her down, and to be content with a humbler lot. He,
                  therefore, sought, and obtained a situation as a clerk at a salary of eight
                  hundred dollars per annum. Already he had been compelled to move into a smaller
                  house than the one at first taken, and in this he was now able to remain.</p>
               <p>But seeing, with a clearer vision than before, Wilmer perceived that much of the
                  bloom had faded from his wife's young cheek, and that her heart had not ceased to
                  yearn for the home and loved ones of her earlier years.</p>
               <p>Another year passed away, and during the whole of that time not one word of
                  kindness or censure reached the ears of Constance from her parents. They seemed to
                  have not only cast her off, abut to have forgotten the fact of her existence. To a
                  mind like that of Theodore Wilmer's, any condition in which a beloved one was made
                  to suffer keenly, and as he believed, alone through him, could not be endured
                  without serious inroads upon a shattered constitution; and much to his alarm, by
                  the end of the year he found that he was less able than usual to attend through
                  the whole day to the fatiguing duties of the counting-room. Frequently he would
                  return home at night with a pain in his breast, that often continued accompanied
                  by a troublesome cough through a greater part of the night. The morning, too,
                  often found him feverish and debilitated, and with no appetite.</p>
               <p>The engrossing love of a mother for her first-born, relieved, during this year, in
                  a great degree, the aching void of Constance Wilmer's breast. The face of her
                  sweet babe often reflected a smile of deep, heart-felt happiness, lighting up, ere
                  it faded away into the sober cast of thought, a feeble ray upon the face of her
                  husband. The steady lapse of days, and weeks, and months, brought a steady
                  development of the mind and body of their little one. He was the miniature image
                  of his father, with eyes, in which Wilmer could see all the deep love which lay in
                  the dark depths of those that had won his first affections. Happy would they have
                  been but (who would not be happy were it not for that little word?) for one
                  yearning desire in the heart of Constance for the lost love of her mother—but for
                  the trembling fear of want that stared Theodore daily in the face. His salary as
                  clerk was small, and to live in New York cost them no trifle. At last, owing to
                  the failure of the house by which he was employed, the dreaded event came. He was
                  out of a situation, and found it impossible to obtain one. the failure had been a
                  very bad one, and there was a strong<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC5627-00000207"/>
                  suspicion of unfair dealing. The prejudice against the house, extended even to the
                  clerks, and several of them, finding it very difficult to get other places that
                  suited them, left New York for other cities. One of them, a friend to Wilmer, came
                  to Baltimore, and got into a large house; a vacancy soon occurring, he recommended
                  Wilmer, who was sent for. He came at once, for neither to him nor his wife was
                  there anything attractive in New York. His salary was to be five hundred
                  dollars.</p>
               <p>In removing to Baltimore, he took with him the greater part of the furniture that
                  he had at first purchased, some of which was of a superior quality. There he
                  rented a small house, and endeavoured by the closest economy to make his meagre
                  salary sufficient to meet every want. But this seemed impossible.</p>
               <p>Gradually, every year he found himself getting behind-hand, from fifty to sixty
                  dollars. The birth of a second child added to his expenses; and, the failing
                  health of his wife, increased then still more. Finally, he got in arrears with the
                  agent of Mr. Moneylove, his landlord. At this time, an apparently rapid decline
                  had become developed in the system of his wife, and on the night on which he had
                  appealed to this person's feelings of humanity, as mentioned in the opening of the
                  story, he found her, on his return, extremely ill. A high fever had set in, and
                  she was suffering. much from difficult respiration. The physician must, of course,
                  be called in, even though but the day before he had put off his collector for the
                  tenth time. Sad, from many causes, he turned again from the door of his dwelling,
                  and sought the physician.</p>
               <p>He rang the bell, and waited with a throbbing heart, for the appearance of the man
                  he earnestly desired, and yet dreaded to; see. When he heard his step upon the
                  stairs, his cheek began to burn, and he even trembled as a criminal might be
                  supposed to tremble in the presence of his judge. For a moment he thought only of
                  his unpaid bill, in the next of his suffering wife. The physician entered.
                  Theodore hesitated, and spoke in a low, timid voice, as he requested a call that
                  night upon his wife.</p>
               <p>"Is Mrs. Wilmer very ill?" inquired the physician, in a kind voice.</p>
               <p>"I fear seriously so, sir."</p>
               <p>"How long has she been sick?"</p>
               <p>"It has been several weeks since she complained of a pain in her side; and all
                  that time she has been troubled with a hard cough. For the last few days she has
                  hardly been able to move about, and to-night she is in a high fever, and finds
                  great difficulty in breathing."</p>
               <p>"Then she must be attended to, at once. Why did you not call before, Mr. Wilmer?
                  Such delays, you know, are very dangerous."</p>
               <p>"I do—I do—but"—Wilmer hesitated, and looked troubled and confused.</p>
               <p>"But what, Mr. Wilmer?" urged the physician in the kindest manner.</p>
               <p>"I—I—I have not been able to pay your last bill, much as I have desired it. My
                  salary is small, and I find it very difficult to get along."</p>
               <p>"Still, my dear sir, health and life are of great value. And besides, if you had
                  called in a physician at the earliest stage of Mrs. Wilmer's illness, you might
                  have saved much expense, as well as spared her much suffering. But cheer up, sir;
                  bright sunshine always succeeds the cloud and the storm. I shall be glad to have
                  my bill when it is convenient, and not before. Don't let it cause you an uneasy
                  moment."</p>
               <p>The kind manner of the physicians soothed his feelings, and the prompt visit, and
                  prompt relief given softened the stern anguish of his troubled spirit. The bruised
                  reed is never broken. When the stricken heart is tried, it is never beyond the
                  point of endurance.</p>
               <p>In no instance had Wilmer drawn from his employers more than his regular salary,
                  no matter how pressing were his necessities. Beyond the contract he had
                  entertained no desire to go, but strove, in everything, to keep down his expenses
                  to his slender income. Now, however, in view of the threat made by the collector
                  of rents, after having thought and thought about it until bewildered with a
                  distressing sense of his almost hopeless condition, he came to the resolution to
                  ask an advance of fifty dollars, to be kept back from his regular wages, at the
                  rate of five dollars a month. For some hours he pondered this plan in his mind,
                  and obtained much relief from the imaginary execution of it, But when the moment
                  came to<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC5627-00000208"/> ask the favour, his heart sank
                  within him, and his lips were sealed. In alternate struggles like this, the
                  morning of the first day passed, after his interview with Mr. Money. love, and
                  still he had not been able to prefer his humble request. When he went home to
                  dine, in consequence of the continued perturbation of his mind for hours, he was
                  pale and nervous, with no inclination for food. To add to his distress of mind,
                  his oldest child, now a fine boy of four summers, had been taken extremely ill
                  since morning, and the anxiety consequent upon it, had painfully excited the
                  feeble system of his wife. Another visit from the physician became necessary, and
                  was promptly made.</p>
               <p>Frequently, in consequence of pressing calls at home, he had been almost forced to
                  remain longer away from his place of business at dinner-time, than was customary
                  for the clerks. On this day, two hours had glided by when his hasty foot entered
                  the store, on his return from dinner. His fears of a distraint for rent were
                  greatly heightened in consequence of the increased illness of his family, and as
                  the only way to prevent it that had occurred to his mind, was to obtain from his
                  employers a loan of fifty dollars as just mentioned, he had fully made up his mind
                  to waive all feeling and at once name his request. Two hours we have said had
                  expired since he went home to dine. On his entering the counting-room, the senior
                  partner of the house drew out his watch, and remarked, rather angrily, that he
                  could not permit such neglect of duty in a clerk, and that unless he kept better
                  hours, he must look for another place.</p>
               <p>It was some time before the confusion of his mind, consequent upon this censure
                  and threat, subsided sufficiently to allow him to feel keenly the utter
                  prostration of the last expectation for help, that had arisen like an angel of
                  hope, in what seemed the darkest hour of his fate. And bitter indeed, were then
                  his thoughts. Those who have never felt it, cannot imagine the awful distress
                  which the mind feels, while contemplating the wants of those who are dearer than
                  all the world, without possessing the means of relieving them. At times, there is
                  a wild excitement, an imaginary consciousness of power to do all things; too
                  quickly, alas! succeeded by the chilling certainty that honestly and honourably it
                     <emph>can do nothing</emph>.</p>
               <p>Slowly and painfully passed the hours until nightfall, and then Wilmer again
                  sought with hasty steps the nest that sheltered his beloved ones. Alas! the
                  spoiler had been there. True to his threat, the agent of Mr. Moneylove had taken
                  quick means to get his own. All of his furniture had been seized, and not only
                  seized, but nearly everything, except a bed and a few chairs, removed in his
                  absence.</p>
               <p>"O, Constance, <emph>what</emph> is the meaning of this?" was his agonized
                  question, to his weeping wife, who met him ill as she was at the door, and hid her
                  face in his bosom, like a dove seeking protection.</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell, Theodore. Everything has been carried off under distraint for
                  rent, so they said, who came here. But you do not owe any rent, do you? I am sure
                  you never mentioned it."</p>
               <p>"It is too true—too true," was his only answer. Carefully had Wilmer concealed
                  from his wife all his troubles. He could not think of adding one pang more to the
                  heart that had already suffered so much on his account. Wisely he did not act in
                  this, but few can blame the weakness that shrunk from giving pain to a beloved
                  object. There are few who have not, sometime in life, found themselves in
                  situations of trial and distress, in which nothing was left them but submission.
                  In that very condition did this lonely family, strangers in a strange place, find
                  themselves on this night of strong trial. They experienced a ray of comfort, and
                  that was the apparent health re-action in the system of their sick child. With
                  this to cheer them, they gathered their two little ones with them in their only
                  bed, and slept soundly through the night.</p>
               <p>Their servant had left them the day before, and they were spared the mortification
                  of having such a witness of their humiliation. Mrs. Wilmer found it somewhat
                  difficult to prepare their food on the next morning, as even her kitchen furniture
                  had nearly all shared the fate of the rest, and she found herself very feeble.
                  Something like three hundred dollars worth had been taken for a debt of forty or
                  fifty. The slender breakfast over, with the reprimand of the day before painfully
                  fresh in his mind, Wilmer hastened away to the counting-room. He had only been a
                  few moments at the desk, when the partner who<pb n="416-417"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000209"/> had spoken to him the day before, came up with the
                  morning's paper in his hand, and pointing to an advertisement of a sale of
                  furniture seized for rent due by Theodore Wilmer, asked him if he was the person
                  named. Wilmer looked at him for some moments, vainly attempting to reply, his face
                  exhibiting the most painful emotions —finally, he laid his head upon the desk
                  without a word, and gave way to tears. It was a weakness, but he was not then
                  superior to it.</p>
               <p>"How much do you owe for rent?"</p>
               <p>"Forty dollars."</p>
               <p>"Forty dollars! And is it for this sum alone that your furniture has been
                  taken?"</p>
               <p>"That is all I owe for rent."</p>
               <p>"Then why did you not let us know your condition? You should have had more
                  consideration for your family."</p>
               <p>"Yesterday, sir," Wilmer replied, somewhat bitterly, "I came here from dinner,
                  after having been unavoidably detained with a sick child, resolved to conquer my
                  reluctance, and ask for the loan of fifty dollars, to be deducted from my salary,
                  at the rate of five dollars a month. But your reproof for remissness deterred me.
                  And when I returned home, the work had been done. They have left us but a bed, a
                  few chairs, and a common table. Oh, sir, it seems as if it would kill me!"</p>
               <p>"But, my dear sir, when I complained, you owed it to yourself, and you owed it to
                  me, to explain. How could I know your peculiar situation?"</p>
               <p>"Have you ever felt, sir, that no one cared for you? As if even Heaven had
                  forgotten you? If not, then you cannot understand my feelings. It may be wrong,
                  but always meaning to act justly towards every one, I feel so humbled by
                  accusation, that I have no heart to explain. It seems to me that others should
                  know that I would not wrong them."</p>
               <p>"It certainly is wrong, Mr. Wilmer. Suppose you had simply mentioned yesterday the
                  illness of your child; I should at once have withdrawn my censure, and probably
                  have made some kind inquiry; you would then have been more free to prefer your
                  request, which would have been at once granted. See what it would have saved your
                  family."</p>
               <p>"I see it all. Feeling always obscures the judgment."</p>
               <p>"To one in your particular situation, a right knowledge of the truth you have just
                  uttered is all-important. No matter what may be your condition, never suffer
                  feeling to become so acute as to dim your sober thoughts, and paralyze your right
                  actions. But here are a hundred dollars. Redeem your things, and get on your feet
                  again. Take them as an advance on your salary for the last year; and draw six
                  hundred instead of five, in future."</p>
               <p>A grateful look told the joy of his heart, as he hastened away. In one hour the
                  furniture which the day before had been forcibly taken away, was at his own
                  door.</p>
               <p>Relief from present embarrassment, and a fair prospect of a full support for the
                  future, gave Wilmer a lighter heart than he had carried in his bosom for many
                  months. The reaction made him for a time happy. But, while our hearts are evil, we
                  cannot be happy, except for brief periods. The disease will indicate by pain its
                  deep-rooted presence.</p>
               <p>The drooping form of his wife soon called his thoughts back to misery. Health had
                  wandered away, and the smiling truant strayed so long, that hope of her return had
                  almost forsaken them.</p>
               <p>Nearly five years had passed since Constance turned away, almost broken-hearted,
                  from the door-stone of her father's house; and during all that long, long time,
                  she had received no token of remembrance. She dared not suffer herself to think
                  even for a moment on the cruel fact. The sudden, involuntary remembrance of such a
                  change from the fondest affection to the most studied disregard, would almost
                  madden her.</p>
               <p>As for Wilmer, the recollection of the past was as a thorn in his pillow, too
                  often driving sleep from a wearied frame, that needed its health-restoring
                  influence. And often, deep and bitter were his self-reproaches. But for his fatal
                  and half-insane abandonment of himself to the vain hope of gaining a foothold by
                  which he might rapidly elevate his condition for the sake of Constance, he was now
                  conscious that, slowly, but surely, he would have risen, by the power of an
                  internal energy of character. And more deeply conscious was he, that, but for the
                  half-intoxicated condition in which he was when he consented<pb n="418-419"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000210"/> to go to a gaming-house, he never would have
                  abandoned himself to gaming and drinking as he did for two long years of excited
                  hopes, and dark, gloomy despondency. Two years, that broke down his spirits, and
                  exhausted the energies of his physical system. Two years, from whose sad effects,
                  neither mind nor body was ever again able to recover.</p>
               <p>But now let us turn from the cast-off, from the forsaken, to the parents who had
                  estranged themselves from their child.</p>
               <p>A foreign arrival had brought letters from Mr. Jackson's agent in Holland,
                  containing information of a great fall in tobacco. Large shipments had been made
                  by several houses, and especially by that of Mr. Jackson, in anticipation of high
                  prices resulting from a scarcity of the article in the German markets. But the
                  shipments had been too large, and a serious decline in price was the consequence.
                  Any interruption of trade, by which the expectation of profits entertained for
                  months is dashed to the ground in a moment, has, usually, the effect to make the
                  merchant unhappy for a brief period. It takes some time for the energies of his
                  mind, long directed in one course, to gather themselves up again, and bend to some
                  new scheme of profit. The "tobacco speculation" of 18—, had been a favourite
                  scheme of Mr. Jackson's, and he had entered into it more largely than any other
                  American house. Its failure necessarily involved him in a heavy loss.</p>
               <p>As evening came quietly down, sobering into a browner mood the feelings of Mr.
                  Jackson, the merchant turned his steps slowly towards his home. Naturally, the
                  smiling image of his daughter came up before his mind, and he quickened his pace
                  instinctively. He remembered how nearly he had lost even this darling treasure,
                  and chid himself for being troubled at the loss of a few thousand dollars, when he
                  was so rich in the love of a lovely child. He rang the bell with a firmer hand,
                  and stepped more lightly as he entered the hall, in anticipation of the sweet
                  smile of his heart's darling. He felt a little disappointed at not finding her in
                  the sitting-room, but did not ask for her, in expectation of seeing her enter each
                  moment. So much was he engrossed with her image that he almost forgot his business
                  troubles. Gradually his mind, from the over-excitement of the day, became a little
                  fretted, as he listened in vain for her light foot-fall at the door. When the bell
                  rung for tea, he started, and asked,—</p>
               <p>"Where is Constance?"</p>
               <p>"In her room, I suppose," replied Mrs. Jackson, indifferently. They seated
                  themselves at the tea-table, and waited for a few moments; but Constance did not
                  come.</p>
               <p>"John, run up and call Constance; perhaps she did not hear the bell."</p>
               <p>John returned in a moment with the intelligence that his young mistress was not
                  there.</p>
               <p>"Then, where is she?" asked both the parents at once.</p>
               <p>"Don't know," replied John, mechanically.</p>
               <p>"Call Sarah."</p>
               <p>Sarah came.</p>
               <p>"Where is Constance?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"Did she go out this afternoon?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am. She went out about two hours ago, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"That's strange," said her mother. "She always tells me where she is going."</p>
               <p>Both parents left the tea-table, each with a heavy presentiment of coming trouble
                  about the heart. They went, as by one consent, to Constance's chamber. The mother
                  proceeded to look into her drawers, and found to her grief and astonishment that
                  they were nearly all empty.</p>
               <p>For some time, neither spoke a word. The truth had flashed upon the mind of each
                  at the same moment.</p>
               <p>"It may not yet be too late," were the first words spoken, and by the mother.</p>
               <p>"<emph>It is too late,</emph>" was the brief, but meaning response.</p>
               <p>From that time her name was not mentioned, and even her portrait was taken down
                  and thrown into the lumber-room. Her few letters, after her hasty and imprudent
                  marriage, were burned up without being opened. So much for wounded family pride!
                  But think not that her image was really obliterated from their minds. No—no. It
                  was there an ever constant and living presence.—<pb n="420-421"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000211"/> Though neither of the parents spoke of, or alluded
                  to her, yet they could not drive away her spiritual presence.</p>
               <p>Year after year glided away, and though the name of Constance had never passed
                  their lips, and they knew nothing of her destiny; yet as year after year passed,
                  her image, now a sad, tearful image, grew more and more distinct before their
                  eyes. In their dreams they often saw her in suffering and nigh unto death, and
                  when they would stretch forth their hands to save her, she would be snatched out
                  of their sight. Still they mentioned not her name; and the world thought the
                  cold-hearted, unnatural parents had even forgotten their child.</p>
               <p>But what had they now to live for? To such as they, no happiness resulted from
                  doing good to others, for the love of self had extinguished all love of the
                  neighbour. The passion for accumulating, it is true, still remained with the
                  merchant; but trade had become so broken up and diverted from its old channels,
                  that he realized small profits, and frequent losses. Finally, he retired from
                  business, and from the city.</p>
               <p>After the marriage of Constance, Mrs. Jackson found herself of far less
                  consideration in company. Few in high life are altogether heartless, and all are
                  ready to censure any exhibition of family pride, which is carried so far as to
                  alienate the parent from the child. This feeling the mother of Constance found to
                  prevail wherever she went, and she never attributed the coolness of fashionable
                  acquaintances, nor the gradual falling away of more intimate friends, to any other
                  than the right cause. How could she? In her case the adage was true to the
                  letter—"A guilty conscience needs no accusation."</p>
               <p>Nearly ten years had passed away since the parents became worse than childless.
                  They were living at their country residence near Harlaem, enduring, but not
                  enjoying life. They had wealth, and every comfort and luxury that wealth could
                  bring. But the slave who toiled in the burning sun, and prepared his own coarse
                  food at night in a dirty hovel, was happier than they. Even unto this time had
                  they not spoken together of their child, since the day of her departure.</p>
               <p>One night in August, a terrible storm swept over New York and its neighbourhood.
                  Flash after flash of keen lightning blazed across the sky, and peal after peal of
                  awful thunder rent the air. It came up about midnight, and continued for more than
                  an hour. Mr. and Mrs. Jackson were roused from slumber by this terrible war of the
                  elements. Its noise had troubled their sleep ere it awoke them, and their dreams
                  were of their child. During its awful continuance, while they felt themselves more
                  intimately in the hands of the All-Powerful, their many sins passed rapidly before
                  them, but the stain that darkened the whole of the last ten years, the one crime
                  of many years, which made their hearts sick within them with a strange fear, was
                  their conduct towards their child. But neither spoke of it. Upon this subject, for
                  several years, they had been afraid of each other.</p>
               <p>The storm passed away, but they could not sleep. Wearied nature sought, but could
                  find no repose. Each tossed and turned and wished for the morning, and when the
                  morning began to dawn they closed their eyes, and almost wished the darkness had
                  continued. A troubled sleep fell upon the husband, and in it he murmured the name
                  of his child. The quick ear of the mother caught the word, and it thrilled through
                  every nerve. Tears stole down her cheeks, and her heart swelled near to bursting
                  with maternal instincts. The vision of his child that passed before him had been
                  no pleasant one, and with the murmur of her name he awoke to consciousness.
                  Lifting himself up, he saw the tearful face of his wife. He could not mistake the
                  cause. Why should she weep but for her child? He looked at her for a moment, when
                  she pronounced the name of Constance, and hid her tearful face on his breast.</p>
               <p>The fountain was now unsealed, and the feelings of the parents gushed out like the
                  flow of pent-up waters. They talked of Constance, and blamed themselves, and wept
                  for their lost one. But where was she? how could they find her?</p>
               <p>The sun had scarcely risen, when Mr. Jackson set out to seek for his child, while
                  his wife remained at home in a state of agonizing suspense. He knew not whether
                  she were alive or dead; in New York or elsewhere. The second day brought Mrs.
                  Jackson a letter, it ran as follows:—</p>
               <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC5627-00000212"/>
               <p>"I have searched in vain for our Constance. But how could it be otherwise? Who
                  should know more about her than myself? I have asked some of our old acquaintances
                  if they ever heard of her since her marriage. They shake their heads and look at
                  me as though they thought me demented. Laura Wykoff, you know, married some years
                  ago. I called upon her. She knew little or nothing; but said, she had heard that
                  her husband who had become dissipated had left her and gone off to Baltimore. She
                  thought it highly probable that she had been dead some years. She treated me
                  coldly enough. But I feel nothing for myself. Poor, dear child! where can thy lot
                  be cast? Perhaps, how dreadful the thought! she may have dragged her drooping,
                  dying form past our dwelling, once her peaceful home, and looked her last look
                  upon the door shut to her for ever, while the cold winds of winter chilled her
                  heart in its last pulsations. Oh, I fear we have murdered our poor child! Every
                  meagre-looking, shrinking female form I pass on the street, makes my heart throb.
                  'Perhaps that is Constance,' I will say, and hasten to read the countenance of the
                  forlorn one. But I turn away, and sigh; 'where, where can she be?'</p>
               <p>"Since writing this, I have seen a young man who knew her husband. He says, that
                  after the failure of a house in which Wilmer was employed, he went to Baltimore
                  and took Constance with him. He says, he knows this to be so, because he was well
                  acquainted with Wilmer, and shook hands with him on the steamboat when he went
                  away. I hinted to him what I had heard about Wilmer's leaving her. He repelled the
                  insinuation with warmth, and said, that he, Wilmer, would have died rather than
                  cause Constance a painful feeling—that she certainly did go with him, for when he
                  parted with Wilmer, Constance was leaning on his arm. He says, she looked pale and
                  troubled; and mentioned that they had with them a sweet little baby. Oh, how my
                  heart yearns after my child!</p>
               <p>"I have since learned the name of the firm in Baltimore in whose employment he
                  was, shortly after he went there. To-morrow morning I shall go to that city. You
                  shall hear from me on my arrival."</p>
               <p>Nearly a week passed before Mrs. Jackson received further intelligence from her
                  husband. I will not attempt to describe her feelings during that long time. In
                  suffering or joy we discover how relative and artificial are all our ideas of
                  time.</p>
               <p>The next letter ran thus:—</p>
               <p>"Here I am in Baltimore, but it seems no nearer finding our child than when I was
                  in New York. The firm in whose employment Wilmer was shortly after his arrival in
                  Baltimore, has been dissolved some years; and I am told that neither of the
                  partners is now in this city. I have not been able to learn the name of a single
                  clerk who was in their store. I feel disheartened, yet more eager every day to
                  find our lost one. Where can she be?</p>
               <p>"A day more has passed since my arrival here, and I have a little hope. I have
                  found one of his former fellow-clerks. He says, that he thinks Wilmer is still in
                  town. I do not want to advertise for him, if I can help it, but shall do so before
                  I leave the city, if other means fail. This young man tells me, that when he knew
                  him he had three children. He never saw our Constance. He represents Wilmer as
                  having been in bad health, and as generally appearing dejected. He says, all his
                  furniture was once seized and sold by the sheriff for rent, but that it was
                  redeemed next day by his employers, who treated him very kindly on the occasion. I
                  have heard nothing of the poor boy that has not prepossessed me in his favour. I
                  fear he has had a hard time of it. How much happiness have we lost—how much misery
                  have we occasioned!—Surely we have lived in vain all our lives! I feel more
                  humbled every day since I left home.</p>
               <p>"Since yesterday I have learned that he was in the city less than a year ago—and
                  that Constance was living. How my heart throbs! Shall I see my own dear child
                  again? Theodore, I fear, is in very bad health, if still alive. He had to give up
                  a good situation about a year ago, as book-keeper in a large establishment here,
                  where he was much esteemed, on account of his health giving way so fast under the
                  confinement. I believe he took another situation as salesman in a retail store, on
                  a very small salary. Some one told me that Constance had been under the necessity
                  of taking in sewing, to help to get a<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC5627-00000213"/>
                  living—and all this time we had abundance all around us! I call myself,
                  'wretch,'—and so I would call any other man who would cast off his child, as I
                  have done—a tender flower to meet the cold winds of autumn.</p>
               <milestone n="*    *    *    *    *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"I have seen my child! my poor dear Constance! But oh, how changed! While passing
                  along the street to-day, almost in despair of ever finding her—a slender female,
                  about the same height of Constance, passed me hastily. There was something
                  peculiar, I thought, about her, and I felt as I had never yet felt, while near a
                  stranger. I followed her, scarce knowing the reason why. She entered a
                  clothing-store, and I went in after her, and asked to look at some article, I
                  scarce knew what. Her first word startled me as would a shock of electricity. It
                  was my own child. But I could not make myself known to her there. She laid down
                  upon the counter three vests, and then presented a small book. in which to have
                  the work entered. The entry was made, and the book handed back.</p>
               <p>"'There are just three dollars due you,' said the man.</p>
               <p>"'Three-and-a-half, I believe it is, sir.'</p>
               <p>"'No, it's only three.'</p>
               <p>"'Then I have calculated wrong. I thought it was three-and-a-half.'</p>
               <p>"How mournful and disappointed was her tone!</p>
               <p>"After standing for some time looking over her book, she said in a lighter voice,
                  'well, I believe I <emph>am</emph> right. See here; I have made twenty-eight
                  vests, and at twelve-and-a-half cents each, that is three dollars and a half.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, I believe you are right,' said the man, in a changed tone, after looking
                  over the book again.</p>
               <p>"'Can you pay me to-day? I am much in want of it.'</p>
               <p>"'No, I can't. I have a thousand dollars to pay in bank, and I cannot spare
                  anything before two or three days.'</p>
               <p>"She paused a moment, and then went slowly towards the door; lingered for a short
                  time, and then turned to the man again. I then saw for the first time, for ten
                  long years, her face. How thin and pale it was! how troubled its expression!—But
                  it was the face of our dear Constance. She did not look towards me; but turned
                  again to the shop-keeper, and said,</p>
               <p>"'Be kind enough, sir, to let me have one dollar. I want it very much!'</p>
               <p>"'You give me more trouble about your money than any other workman I have,' said
                  the man roughly, as he handed her a dollar.</p>
               <p>"She took it, unheeding the cruel remark, and before I could make up my mind how
                  to act, glided quickly away. I followed as hastily, and continued to walk after
                  her, until I saw her enter a large, old-fashioned brick building. About this
                  dwelling, there was no air of comfort. In the door sat a little girl, and two
                  boys, pale, but pleasant-looking children. One of them clapped his little hands as
                  Constance passed them, and then got up and ran after her into the house. They all
                  had her own bright eyes. I would have known them for <choice>
                     <sic>her's</sic>
                     <corr>hers</corr>
                  </choice> anywhere.</p>
               <p>"Does it not seem strange that I hesitated to go in at once to my child. But I am
                  at a loss what to do. Sometimes I think that I will wait until you come on, and
                  make her heart glad with the presence of both at once. To-morrow I will write you
                  again. The mail is just closing; and I must send this."</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>After Wilmer had received the kindly proffered relief from his employers, in an
                  increase of salary, he was less troubled about the daily wants of his family. But
                  other sources of keen anxiety soon presented themselves. His own health began to
                  give way so rapidly as to awaken in his mind, fearful apprehensions of approaching
                  inability to support his family; and Constance was not strong. Too often, the pain
                  in his breast and side was so severe as to make his place at the desk little less
                  than torture. A confirmed, short, dry cough, not severe, but constant, also
                  awakened his liveliest fears.</p>
               <p>At the end of a year from the time when his employers began to feel a kind
                  interest in him, he was removed from the desk, and given more active employment as
                  salesman and out-of-door clerk. The benefit of this change was soon felt. The pain
                  in his breast and side gradually gave way, his appetite increased, and his cough
                  became less<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC5627-00000214"/> and less irritating. But
                  this improvement was only temporary. The disease had become too deeply rooted.
                  True, he suffered much less than while confined at the desk, but the morbid
                  indications were too constant to leave him much of the flattery of hope.</p>
               <p>Another year gradually rolled away, and with it came more changes, and causes of
                  concern. A little stranger had come into his family, making three the number of
                  his babes, and adding to the list of his cares and his expenses; and it must also
                  be said, to his pleasures. For what parent, with the heart of a parent, be his
                  condition what it may, but rejoices in the number of the little ones whose eyes
                  brighten at his coming? But there was a change of greater importance in his
                  prospects. The firm in whose service he was, became involved and had to wind up
                  their business. All the clerks were in a short time discharged, and Wilmer among
                  the rest. The time was one of great commercial pressure, and many long-established
                  houses were forced to yield; others were driven to great curtailment of expenses.
                  The consequence was that few were employing clerks, and many dispensing with their
                  services. Under the circumstances, Wilmer found it impossible to obtain
                  employment. Daily did he call at the various stores and counting-rooms in the hope
                  of meeting with a situation, only to return to his dwelling more depressed and
                  disheartened.</p>
               <p>By great economy, in view of approaching ill health, he had managed to lay up,
                  since the increase in his wages, nearly the amount of that increase. He had done
                  this, by living upon the same amount that he before found to be inadequate to the
                  support of his family. How this was done, they only can know who have resolutely,
                  from necessity, made the same experiment, and found that the real amount necessary
                  to live upon is much smaller than is usually supposed. This sum, about one hundred
                  dollars, he had when he was thrown out of employment scarcely enough to last for
                  three months, under their present expenses. It was with painful reluctance that
                  Wilmer trespassed upon this precious store, but he found necessity a hard
                  task-master.</p>
               <p>Amid the gloom and darkness of his condition and prospects, there was one bright
                  star shining upon him with an ever-constant light. No cloud could dim or obscure
                  it. That light, that cheerful star, was the wife of his bosom. The tie that bound
                  her to her husband was not an external one alone; she was wedded to him in spirit.
                  Her affection for him, as sorrow, and doubt, and fearful foreboding of coming
                  evils gathered about him, assumed more and more of the mother's careful and
                  earnest love for the peace of her child. She met him with an ever-cheerful
                  countenance; gently soothed his fears, and constantly referred him to the
                  overruling care of Divine Providence. Affliction had wrought its proper work upon
                  her affections, and as they became gradually separated from the world, they found
                  a higher and purer source of attraction. From a thoughtless girl, she had become a
                  reflecting woman, and with reflection had come. a right understanding of her
                  duties. An angel of comfort is such a woman to a man of keen sensibilities, who
                  finds his struggle in the world a hard and painful one.</p>
               <p>Two months passed away in the vain effort to obtain employment. Every avenue
                  seemed shut against him. The power of endurance was tried to its utmost strength,
                  when he was offered a situation in an iron-store, to handle iron, and occasionally
                  perform the duties of a clerk. Three hundred dollars was the salary. He caught at
                  it, as his last hope, with eagerness, and at once entered upon his duties. He
                  found them more toilsome than he had expected. The business was a heavy one, and
                  kept him at fatiguing labour nearly the whole day. Never having been used to do
                  hard work, he found on the morning of the second day, that the muscles of his
                  back, arms, and legs, were so strained, that he could hardly move himself. He was
                  as sore as if he had been beaten with a heavy stick. This, however, in a great
                  measure, wore off, after he began to move about; but he found his strength giving
                  way much sooner on this day than on the preceding one. At night, his head ached
                  badly, he had no appetite, and was feverish. On the next morning, however, he went
                  resolutely to work; but he felt so unfit for it, that he finally, referring in his
                  own mind to what he had suffered on a former occasion by not explaining his true
                  situation, determined to mention to his new employer how he felt. and ask a little
                  respite for a day or two, until his strength<pb n="428-429"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000215"/> should return. He, accordingly, left the large pile
                  of iron which he had commenced assorting, and entered the counting-room. He felt a
                  great degree of hesitation, but strove to keep it down, while he summoned up
                  resolution to utter distinctly and mildly his request.</p>
               <p>The man of iron was busy over his bill-book when Wilmer sought his presence, and
                  looked up with a stern aspect.</p>
               <p>"I feel quite sick," began Theodore, an older man than his employer, "from working
                  beyond my strength for the last two days, and should be very glad if you could
                  employ me at something lighter for as long a time, until I recover myself, when I
                  will be much stronger than when I began, and able to keep steadily on. I have
                  never been used to hard labour, and feel it the more severely now."</p>
               <p>Mr. —— looked at him with a slight sneer for a moment, and then replied,—</p>
               <p>"I can't have any playing about me If my work suits you, well; if not, there are a
                  plenty whom it will suit."</p>
               <p>Silently did Wilmer withdraw from the presence of the unfeeling man, and turned
                  with aching limbs to his toilsome work.</p>
               <p>At night he found himself much worse than on the preceding evening; and on the
                  ensuing morning he was unable to go to the store. It was nearly a week before he
                  could again find his way out, and then he was in a sadly debilitated state, from
                  the effects of a fever brought on by over-exertion. He went to the iron-store, and
                  formally declined his situation. No offer was made to reengage him, and as he
                  turned away from the door of the counting-room, he heard the man remark, in a
                  sneering under-tone to a person present, "a poor milk-sop!"</p>
               <p>Generally, the unfortunate are stung to the quick by any reflection upon them by
                  those in a better condition; and few were more alive to ridicule than Wilmer. Both
                  the condition and the constitutional infirmity combined, made the remark of Mr. ——
                  produce in his bosom a tempest of agitation; and for a moment he was roused from
                  his usual calm exterior; but he recovered himself as quick as thought, and hurried
                  away. He did not go directly home, but wandered listlessly about for several
                  hours. When he returned at the usual dinner hour, he found his wife busily engaged
                  in preparing dinner. Her babe was asleep in the cradle, by which sat the eldest
                  boy, touching it with his foot, while the other little one, about four years old,
                  was prattling away to her baby-doll.</p>
               <p>"Why Constance, where is Mary?"</p>
               <p>"She has gone away," was the smiling reply.</p>
               <p>"How comes that? I thought she appeared very well satisfied."</p>
               <p>"She was very well pleased with her place, I believe; but as I have taken it into
                  my head to do without her, and am a very wilful creature, as you know, why, there
                  was no remedy but to let her get another place. So I told her as much this
                  morning, and she has already found a pleasant situation—not so good, however, as
                  this, she says. Come, don't look so serious about it! Theodore can bring water for
                  me, and you can cut the wood, and among us we will do very well. It is a pity if
                  two people can't take care of themselves, and three other little bodies besides.
                  And just see what we will save?—Four dollars a month for her wages, and her
                  boarding into the bargain. And you know, Mary, though a kind, good sort of a body,
                  and very industrious and obliging, eat almost as much as all the rest of us
                  together."</p>
               <p>"Well, Constance, put as good a face upon the matter as you can, but I feel that
                  stern necessity has brought you to it."</p>
               <p>"You must not talk so much about 'stern necessity,' Theodore. It is surely no
                  great hardship for me to sweep up the house every morning, and get the little food
                  we eat. I know that our income is cut off, for I don't suppose you are going back
                  to that iron-store again. But there will be a way opened, for us. The kind Being
                  who is trying us for our good will not leave us in our last extremity. It is for
                  us to do the best we can, with what we can get. Now that our certain resources are
                  withdrawn, it is for us to limit our expenses to the smallest possible sum. We
                  have, it is true, lived quite frugally for the past year. But it is possible for
                  us to live on much less than the five hundred dollars that it has cost. Our<pb
                     n="430-431" xml:id="VAC5627-00000216"/> servant's wages and boarding were at
                  least one hundred dollars; and by the present retrenchment we save that sum, and
                  shall live just as comfortably, for now we will all help to take care of each
                  other."</p>
               <p>"So far so good, my comforter! But where will the four hundred dollars come
                  from?"</p>
               <p>"Well, let us go on. We pay one hundred and fifty dollars for this house. By going
                  out upon the suburbs of the town, we can get a pleasant little house for five
                  dollars a month."</p>
               <p>"O, no, Constance, you are too fast."</p>
               <p>"Not at all. I have seen just the little place that will suit us. The house is not
                  old, and everything around is sweet and clean. And it's plenty big enough for
                  us."</p>
               <p>"Well, Constance, suppose by so doing we reduce our expenses to three hundred and
                  ten dollars. Where is that sum to come from? I can't get any work."</p>
               <p>"Don't despair, Theodore! We shall not be forsaken. But we must do for ourselves
                  the best we can. I have been turning over a plan in my head, by which we can live
                  much cheaper and a great deal happier; for the less it takes us to live, the less
                  care we shall have about it."</p>
               <p>"Go on."</p>
               <p>"By moving into a smaller house, we can dispense with a great many things which
                  will then be of no use to us. These will bring us from two to three hundred
                  dollars, at public sale. Good furniture, you know, always brings good prices."</p>
               <p>"Well."</p>
               <p>"With this money, we can live in a smaller house, without any servant, for nearly
                  a year; and surely you will get something to do by next spring, even if you should
                  be idle all winter."</p>
               <p>Wilmer kissed the cheek of his wife, now glowing with the excitement of cheerful
                  hope, with a fervent and heartfelt affection, and murmuring in a low voice—"My
                  comforting angel!" turned with a lighter heart than had beat in his bosom for
                  months, to caress the little girl, who was clamouring for her usual kiss.</p>
               <p>That afternoon was spent in discussing the proposed retrenchment, and in going to
                  look at the little house which Mrs. Wilmer had mentioned. It was small, but neat,
                  and had a good yard, with a pump at the door. They decided at once to take it, and
                  obtained possession of the key.</p>
               <p>No time was lost in offering their superfluous furniture at public sale; and to
                  the satisfaction of both Wilmer and his wife, the auctioneer returned them, after
                  deducting his commissions, the net sum of three hundred dollars.</p>
               <p>In one week from the time of Mrs. Wilmer's proposition, they were snugly packed
                  away in their new residence.</p>
               <p>Late in the fall, Wilmer obtained a situation as collector for one of the
                  newspaper offices, on a salary of four hundred dollars. This, under the reduced
                  expense system, and with the surplus on hand, afforded them ample means. The
                  exercise in the open air which it allowed him, was greatly conducive to his
                  health, and he soon showed considerable improvement in body and mind. Things went
                  on smoothly and satisfactorily until about Christmas, when he took a violent cold,
                  on a wet day, which fell upon his lungs, and soon brought him to a very weak
                  state. From this, his recovery was so slow, and his prospect of health so
                  unpromising, that he found it a matter of necessity to decline his situation,
                  which was retained for him as long as the office could wait.</p>
               <p>During the whole of the remaining inclement weather of the winter season, he found
                  it necessary to keep within doors, as he invariably took cold whenever he ventured
                  out.</p>
               <p>Perceiving the failure of her husband's health to be certainly and rapidly
                  progressing, Mrs. Wilmer dwelt in her own mind with painful solicitude upon the
                  probable means of support for them all, when his strength should so entirely give
                  way, as to render him altogether unfitted for business. The only child of
                  over-fond parents, rich in this world's goods, she had received a thorough,
                  fashionable education, which fitted her for doing no one thing by which she could
                  earn any money. Her music had been confined to a few fashionable waltzes and
                  overtures; her French and Spanish were nearly forgotten, and her proficiency in
                  drawing and embroidery had never been very great. In her girlish days she could
                  dance gracefully, and talk fashionable nonsense with a bewitching air<pb
                     n="432-433" xml:id="VAC5627-00000217"/> when it became necessary to amuse some
                  sprig of fashion, or wield good plain common sense with common sense people, when
                  occasion called for it. But as to possessing resources in herself for getting a
                  living in the world, that was another matter altogether. But there is a creative
                  power in necessity, which acts with wonderful skill when the hour of trial comes.
                  That hour had come with Constance, and she steadily cast about her for the means
                  of earning money.</p>
               <p>Next door to where she lived was a widow woman with three grown-up daughters, who
                  were always busy working for the clothing-stores, or "slop-shops," as they were
                  called. She had made their acquaintance during the winter, and found them kind and
                  considerate of others, and ever ready with an encouraging word, or serious advice
                  when called for. The very small compensation which they received for their work,
                  encouraged her but little, when she thought of obtaining something to do in the
                  same way. But the more she thought of other means, the less she found herself
                  fitted for doing anything else, and at last determined to learn how to make common
                  pantaloons, that she might have some resource to fly to, when all others failed.
                  She found her kind neighbours ready to give her all the instruction she needed,
                  and they also kindly offered to introduce her to the shops whenever she should
                  determine to take in work. It did not take her long to learn, and soon after she
                  had acquired the art, as her husband's health still continued to decline, she
                  began, in odd times, to make common pantaloons and vests, for which she received
                  the meagre compensation of twelve-and-a-half cents each. It took her about
                  one-half of her time, actively engaged, to attend to her family.</p>
               <p>During the remaining half of each day and evening, she would make a vest or a pair
                  of pantaloons, which at the end of the week would bring her in seventy-five cents.
                  When she looked at this small sum, the aggregate of a week's labour, during
                  leisure from the concerns of her family, she felt but little encouraged in
                  prospect of having the whole of her little family dependent upon her; and for some
                  weeks she entertained, in the silence of her own heart, a sickening consciousness
                  of coming destitution, which she might in vain endeavour to prevent. Gradually ly
                  her mind reacted from this painful state, and she gave daily diligence to her
                  employments, entertaining a firm trust in Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>As the spring opened, her husband's health revived a little, and he found
                  employment at a small compensation in a retail dry-goods store. This just suited
                  his strength and the state of his health, and he continued at it for something
                  like three years. During this period nothing of material interest occurred, and we
                  pass it over in silence.</p>
               <p>The long-looked-for, long-dreaded time, when Wilmer's health should entirely give
                  way, at length came; and although through the kindness of his employers he had
                  been retained in the store long after he was able to do his full duty, yet at last
                  he had to give up.</p>
               <p>It would require a pen more skilled to portray the workings of the human heart,
                  than mine, to sketch his real feelings, when he received his last month's wages;
                  the last that he felt he would ever earn for his family, and turned his steps
                  homeward. He loved the wife who had forsaken the wealth and comfort of a father's
                  house, and had been all in all to him through sunshine and storm, with deep and
                  tearful affection; he would have sacrificed everything for her; and yet for years
                  had he been compelled to see her toil for a portion of the bread that nourished
                  her and her children. He loved his little ones, with a yearning tenderness; the
                  more fervently and passionately, now that he could no longer minister to their
                  wants. How could he meet them all on this evening, and see their dear faces
                  brighten up on his entrance, when he could no longer earn them food, or provide
                  them with comforts? It was with a strong effort that he kept down his feelings. as
                  he entered his home, now comprised in two rooms in the second story of an old
                  house in Commerce street, where they had removed, to be nearer his place of
                  business, the long walk having been too fatiguing for him, after standing behind
                  the counter all day.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wilmer's quick eye at once detected a change in the expression of her
                  husband's countenance, but she said nothing. After tea, the children were all put
                  to bed in the next room, and they were then alone. Wilmer sat in deep thought by
                  the table, shading his face with his sand<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC5627-00000218"
                  /> when his wife came in from the chamber where she had been with the children.
                  Twining her arm round his neck, she bent over him, and said, in a tone of tender
                  concern—</p>
               <p>"Why so thoughtful, Theodore?"</p>
               <p>He did not reply for some moments, nor lift his head, and Constance was about to
                  repeat her question in a more earnest voice, when a hot tear fell upon her hand.
                  She had seen him often sorely tried and painfully exercised, but had never known
                  him to shed a tear. There had always been a troubled silence in his manner when
                  difficulties pressed upon him, but tears moistened not his eyes. Well might her
                  heart sink down in her bosom at that strange token of intense suffering.</p>
               <p>"Dear Theodore!" she said, in a changed tone, "tell me what it is that troubles
                  you!"</p>
               <p>A shuddering sob was the only reply, as he leaned his head back upon her
                  bosom.</p>
               <p>"Say, dearest, what has happened?"</p>
               <p>The tears now fell from his eyes like rain, and sob after sob shook his frame
                  convulsively.</p>
               <p>Constance waited in silence until the agitation subsided, and then gently urged
                  him to tell her what it was that troubled him so painfully.</p>
               <p>"I am broken in spirits now, Constance. I am a weak child. I have received the
                  last blow, and manhood has altogether forsaken me."</p>
               <p>"Tell me! oh, tell me! Theodore, all, all! Do not distress me by further silence,
                  or mystery!"</p>
               <p>A pause of some minutes succeeded, during which Wilmer was making strong efforts
                  to overcome his feelings.</p>
               <p>"Constance," he at length said, mournfully, "I have tried long, and much beyond my
                  strength, to earn the small sum that it took to support our little ones; but
                  nature has at last given way. Here is the last dollar I shall probably ever earn,
                  and now I shall be a burden upon you, eating the bread of my children, while they,
                  poor things, will hunger for the morsel that nourishes me. I do not wonder that
                  manly feelings have passed away with my strength. Constance, what shall we
                  do?"</p>
               <p>An angel of comfort is woman to life's last extremity. Fragile as a reed, that
                  bends to the passing breeze, when the sunshine of prosperity is bright above and
                  around, she becomes the tall oak, deep-rooted and strong-branched, when the wintry
                  storms of adversity sweep over the earth. No trial subdues her, no privation
                  brings a murmur of discontent. She will hope to the last, and still have a smile
                  of assurance for those who, in their despondency, have even cast away hope.
                  Constance Wilmer was a woman, and as a woman, her worth was felt more and more, as
                  troubles came thicker and faster.</p>
               <p>"Dear husband!" she said, in a steady and cheerful voice, "you have forgotten that
                  line, so true and so comforting— <q>
                     <l>"'Despair is never quite despair'—</l>
                  </q> "I see no cause for such painful feelings. Pinching want is not upon us yet,
                  and I am sure the time will never come when our children shall ask food at our
                  hands in. vain. Trial, which is always for our good, will never reach beyond the
                  point of endurance."</p>
               <p>"The burden is all upon you, Constance. Heaven grant that you may have strength to
                  bear it!"</p>
               <p>"I fear not for the strength. That will come in due time. Now we have food and
                  raiment, and therewith let us be content. If God so clothe the grass of the field,
                  which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, will he not clothe us? He
                  that feedeth the young ravens when they cry, will not turn away from us. Are we
                  not of more value than many sparrows?"</p>
               <p>"Bless you! bless you! Constance."</p>
               <p>"Do not, then, dear husband! cast away your confidence. If the burden is to be all
                  upon me, it will be lightened by your cheerful countenance and encouraging words.
                  I shall need them both, doubtless; then do not withhold them."</p>
               <p>Her voice lost its steadiness, trembled a moment, and then she hid her face, in
                  silence and in tears, upon his bosom.</p>
               <p>As Wilmer had foreseen, the strength for further labour was gone for ever. He
                  lingered about for a few weeks, and then took to his bed. And now came the time
                  for the full trial of Mrs. Wilmer's mental and bodily strength.<pb n="436-437"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000219"/> Notwithstanding all her close application at the
                  needle, the small sum that had been saved from former earnings, slowly, but
                  steadily diminished. Daily she increased her exertions, and encroached further
                  upon the hours of rest; but still there was a steady withdrawal of the hoarded
                  treasure. At first, her confidence in the Divine Providence was measurably shaken;
                  but soon the wavering needle of her faith turned steadily to its polar star. Her
                  own health, never vigorous, began also to give way under the increased application
                  which became necessary for the support of the beloved ones, now entirely dependent
                  upon her labour for food and raiment. Her appetite, never very good, failed
                  considerably, and consequently there was a withdrawal instead of an increase of
                  strength. But none knew of her pain or weakness. Her pale face was ever a cheerful
                  one, and her voice full of tenderness.</p>
               <p>When the next spring opened, Wilmer was not only confined to the house, but unable
                  to sit up, except for a few hours at a time through the day. His wife's health had
                  suffered much, and all the hours she sat at her needle, were hours of painful
                  endurance. Spring passed away, and summer came. But the milder airs had no kind
                  effect upon the fast sinking frame of her husband. He was rapidly going down to
                  the grave, his last hours embittered by the sight of his wife and children
                  suffering before him.</p>
               <p>During the month of August, Wilmer declined so fast, and needed such constant
                  attention, that his wife could find but little time to devote to her needle. What
                  she thus lost in the day-time, she had to make up, as far as possible, by
                  encroaching upon the night hours, and often the lamp by her side would grow dim
                  before the light of day, while she still bent in weariness and pain, over the work
                  that was to give bread to her children.</p>
               <p>For some months her work had been confined to one shop, the master of which was
                  not always punctual in paying her the pittance she earned. Instead of handing her,
                  whenever she called, the trifle due her, he made her procure a little book in
                  which he would enter the work, promising to pay when it would amount to a certain
                  sum. In anxious hope would Mrs. Wilmer wait until her earnings rose to the
                  required amount; but not always then could she get her due; there would too
                  frequently be a part payment, or a request to call in a day or two.</p>
               <p>One day towards the first of September, she found that both food and money were
                  out. She was just finishing a couple of vests for the clothing-shop, and there
                  were more than three dollars due to her. While turning over in her own mind the
                  hope that Mr. —— would pay her the small sum due, when she carried in the work,
                  and troubled the While with fears lest he should deny her, as he had often done
                  before; her husband, whose bright eye had been upon her for some time, and whose
                  countenance, unseen by her, had expressed an earnest, yet hesitating desire to ask
                  for something, said—</p>
               <p>"Constance, I don't know whether you are able to get them, but if you can, I
                  should like, above all things, to have some grapes."</p>
               <p>"Then you shall have some," Constance replied, earnestly and affectionately. "I am
                  sure they will help you. Why did I not think of this for you long ago?"</p>
               <p>Resuming her needle, she plied it with double swiftness, her heart trembling lest
                  when she asked for her money at the shop, it should be refused her. At last the
                  work was done and she carried it in. It was entered, and her book handed back to
                  her. She paused a moment, then turned to go out, but she could not go home without
                  some money. Hesitatingly she asked to have her due, but it was refused on some
                  excuse of having a large payment to make on that very day. Again she turned to go,
                  but again turned to ask for only a part of what was her own. One dollar was thrown
                  her with an unkind remark. The first she seized with avidity, the last passed her
                  ear unheeded.</p>
               <p>How swiftly did she hurry home with her little treasure! more precious than a
                  hundred times the sum had ever been before. It was to meet the first expressed
                  want of her husband, to gratify which she would herself have abstained days from
                  food.</p>
               <p>The grapes were soon obtained, with some bread, and a small portion of meat, for
                  the children. They proved very grateful and refreshing to Wilmer, who, soon after
                  he had eaten a few of them, fell into a gentle sleep.</p>
               <p>The food which Mrs. Wilmer had bought would last<pb n="438-439"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000220"/> them probably about two days—not longer. Two
                  months' rent would be due in a week, amounting to eight dollars. Their landlord
                  had threatened to take some of their things to satisfy the last months' rent, and
                  she had little hope of his being put off longer than the expiration of the two
                  months. There were still two-and-a-half dollars due her by the keeper of the
                  clothing-store, which she knew it would be almost as hard to get as to earn.</p>
               <p>Not disposed, however, to sit down and brood over her difficulties, which only
                  made them worse, she went to work in the best spirit possible to overcome them.
                  She obtained more work, and bent herself again over her daily employment.</p>
               <p>She was sitting with an aching head and troubled heart at her work on the next
                  morning, having only sought a brief repose through the night, when a smart tap at
                  the door roused her from her abstraction of mind.</p>
               <p>"Does Mrs. Wilmer live here, ma'am?" asked a man.</p>
               <p>"That is my name."</p>
               <p>"Then I am directed to leave this basket,"—and the man deposited his burden on the
                  floor, and was gone before another word could be spoken.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wilmer stood for a moment in mute surprise, and then removed the covering off
                  the basket. It contained tea, coffee, sugar, rice, meat, bread, and various other
                  articles of food; and also, a letter directed to "Constance Wilmer." She broke the
                  seal with an anxious and trembling heart. It contained a fifty dollar note, and
                  these brief words:—</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Put by your work—you are cared for—there is help coming, and now
                  very nigh—be of good cheer!"</p>
               <p>The coarse garment she still held in her hand, fell to the floor. Her fingers
                  released themselves from it by an instinctive effort which she could not control.
                  Her head reeled for a moment, and she sunk into a chair, overcome by a tumult of
                  contending feelings. From this, she was aroused by the voice of her husband, who
                  anxiously inquired the contents of the letter. He read it, and saw the enclosure,
                  and the supply of food in the basket, and then clasped his hands and looked up
                  with mute thankfulness to heaven. Mrs. Wilmer obeyed, with a confidence for which
                  she could not account, the injunction of her stranger-friend, and almost hourly
                  for the first day referred to the characters of the letter, which seemed familiar
                  to her eye. That she had seen the writing before, she was certain; but where, or
                  when, she could not tell.</p>
               <p>Relieved from daily care and toil, she had more time to give to her sick husband.
                  She found him nearer the grave than she had supposed.</p>
               <p>Four days more passed away, and Wilmer had come down to the very brink of the dark
                  river of death.</p>
               <p>It was night. The two younger children were asleep, and the oldest boy, just in
                  his tenth year, with his mother, stood anxiously over the low bed, upon which lay,
                  gasping for breath, the dying husband and father. The widow, who cannot forget the
                  dear image of her departed one; the orphan, who remembers the dying agony of a
                  fond father, can realize in a great degree the sorrows which pressed upon the
                  hearts of these lone watchers by the bed of death.</p>
               <p>The last hours of Wilmer's life were hours of distinct consciousness.</p>
               <p>"Constance," he whispered, in a low difficult whisper, while his bright eyes were
                  fixed upon her face—"Constance, what will you do when I am gone? I am but a burden
                  on you now; but my presence I feel is something."</p>
               <p>His stricken-hearted wife could make no answer; but the tears rolled over her face
                  in great drops, and fell fast upon the pillow of her dying husband.</p>
               <p>"I cannot say, 'do not weep,'" continued Wilmer. "O that I could give a word of
                  comfort! but your cup is full, running over, and I cannot dash it from your
                  lips:—Dear Constance! you have been to me a wife and a mother. Let me feel your
                  warm cheek once more against mine, for it is cold, very cold. Hark! did you not
                  hear voices?" And he strained his eyes towards the door, half-lifting himself
                  up.</p>
               <p>For a few moments he looked eagerly for some one to enter, and then fell back upon
                  the bed with a heavy sigh, murmuring to himself, in a low disappointed tone—</p>
               <p>"I thought they were coming."</p>
               <p>"Who, love?" asked Mrs. Wilmer, eagerly. But her husband did not seem to hear her
                  question; but lay gasping for breath, the muscles of his neck and face distorted
                  and giving to his countenance the ghastly expression of death.</p>
               <pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC5627-00000221"/>
               <p>"Who, love?—who were coming?" eagerly asked Mrs. Wilmer again, her own heart
                  trembling with a recurrence of the vague hopes with which the mysterious letter
                  and timely supply had inspired her,—hopes that had never been hinted to her
                  husband. But it seemed that he had given the incident his own interpretation.</p>
               <p>But he heeded not her question. For some time mother and son again stood over him,
                  in troubled silence. Perhaps half an hour had passed since he had spoken, when a
                  slight bustle was heard, on the steps below, and then feet were heard quickly
                  ascending, and hastening along the passage towards their chamber door.</p>
               <p>"They come! They come!" half-shrieked the dying man, springing up in the bed, and
                  bending over towards the door, which was hastily flung open. His eyes glared upon
                  the two persons, a man and woman, both well advanced in life, as they entered.
                  That one anxious gaze was enough. Looking up into the face of Constance, against
                  whose breast his head had sunk, his countenance changed into an expression of
                  intense delight, and he whispered—</p>
               <p>"They have come, Constance! they have come. Think of me as at rest and happy. I
                  die in peace!"</p>
               <p>His eye-lids closed naturally—there was no longer any convulsive play of the
                  muscles, and as an infant sinking into slumber, so quietly did Theodore Wilmer
                  sleep the sleep of death.</p>
               <p>One month from that night of sorrow, the darkest one in the many gloomy seasons of
                  Mrs. Wilmer's life, might have been seen this child of many afflictions, with her
                  three little ones, at home in one of the most pleasant houses in the vicinity of
                  New York. There was something sad and subdued in the expression of her pale face,
                  but it was from the recollection of the past. Her mother, who ten years before had
                  cast her off as unworthy, now gazed upon her with a look of the intensest
                  affection; and the father, who had sworn never to call her his child, sat holding
                  her thin white hand in his, and listening to her first recital of all she had
                  passed through since she left the home of her childhood, while the tears fell from
                  his eyes in large drops, upon the hand that lay within his own.</p>

               <p>MR. WILLIAMS, to whom, when a boy, I was apprenticed to learn the art and mystery
                  by which he supported a pretty large family, was not rich, although, by industry
                  and economy, he had gathered together a few thousand dollars, and owned, besides,
                  two or three neat little houses, the aggregate annual rent of which was something
                  like six hundred dollars. His wife, a weak-minded woman, however, considered him
                  independent, in regard to wealth, and valued herself accordingly. Few held their
                  heads higher, or trode the pavement with a statelier step than Mrs. Williams.</p>
               <p>An elder sister, greatly her superior in every quality of mind, had been far less
                  fortunate in her marriage. She was the wife of a man, who, instead of increasing
                  his worldly goods, the fruit of some twenty years' prudence and industry, had
                  become dissipated, and at the time now referred to, was sinking rapidly, and
                  bearing his family, of course, down with him. All energy seemed lost, and though
                  his family was steadily increasing, he grew more and more careless every day.</p>
               <p>He spent much time in taverns, and wasted there a good deal of money, that his
                  family needed. Mrs. Haller, his wife, was, as has been said, in intelligence and
                  feeling, much the superior of Mrs. Williams, but appeared to little advantage in
                  her peculiar situation. She was the elder sister, by four or five years. At the
                  time of which I am now writing, Mrs. Haller had five children, two of them grown
                  up, and the rest small. Her husband had become so indolent and sottish, that all
                  her exertions were needed to keep her little flock from suffering
                  <note xml:id="note_002">

                        reminiscence of a friend, I give as if related by him from whom I received it.
                        He was, in early years, the apprentice of a tradesman, in whose family the
                        principal incidents occurred. The picture presented is one of every-day
                        life.]</p>

                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000222"/> with cold and hunger. No woman could have laboured
                  more untiringly than she did, but it was labouring against a strong current that
                  bore her little bark slowly, but surely backward. Here, then, are the two sisters;
                  one, the elder, and superior in all the endowments of head and heart—the other
                  with few claims to estimation other than those afforded by a competence of worldly
                  goods. Let us view them a little closer. Perhaps we can read a lesson in their
                  mutual conduct that will not soon be forgotten.</p>
               <p>In earlier years, I have learned, that they were much attached to each other. In
                  their father's house, they knew no cares, and when they married, which was within
                  a few years of each other, their prospects were equal for future happiness. While
                  this equality existed, their intercourse was uninterrupted and affectionate. But,
                  as Mr. Haller began to neglect his family, the cloud that settled upon the brow of
                  his poor wife was not pleasant for Mrs. Williams to look upon. Nor were the
                  complaints that a full heart too often forced to the lips, at all agreeable to her
                  ears. Naturally proud and selfish, these two feelings had been gaining strength
                  with the progress of years, and were now so confirmed, that even towards an only
                  sister in changed circumstances they remained in full activity.</p>
               <p>When I first went to live with Mr. Williams, Mrs. Haller resided in a neatly
                  furnished, small two-story brick house. Her husband had not then shown his
                  vagabond propensities very distinctly, though he spent in his family, and
                  otherwise, all that he earned each week, thus leaving nothing for a rainy day. He
                  was a little in debt, too, but not so much as to make him feel uneasy. Mrs. Haller
                  was anxious to lay up something, and to be getting ahead in the world, and was,
                  consequently, always troubled because things never got any better. She came to our
                  house every week, and Mr. Williams would visit her once in a month or two. Mrs.
                  Haller often talked of her troubles to her sister, who used then to sympathize
                  with her, and make many suggestions of means to gender things more accordant with
                  her desires. As matters gradually grew worse in the progress of time, and Mrs.
                  Haller began to make rather an indifferent appearance, the manner ner of her
                  sister became evidently constrained and unsympathizing. She began to look upon her
                  in the light of a "poor relation." Her children, cousins of course to Mrs.
                  Williams's, were not treated encouragingly when they came to our house, and if
                  company happened to be there, they were kept out of sight, or sent home. Mrs.
                  Williams rarely visited Mrs. Haller—not so often as once in six months.</p>
               <p>Long before the period of which I am now writing, Haller had become drunken and
                  very lazy. Their comfortable house and furniture had been changed for poor rooms,
                  with little in them, except what was barely necessary. The oldest child, a son,
                  about nineteen years of age, on to whose maturity the mother had often looked with
                  a lively hope, following the example of his father, had become idle and
                  dissipated; spending most of his time in low taverns and gambling-shops. Here was
                  a keen sorrow which no heart but a mother's can understand. Oh, what a darkening
                  of all the dreams of early years! When a warm-hearted girl, looking into the
                  pleasant future with a tremulous joy, she stood beside her chosen one at the
                  altar, how little did she dream of the shadows and darkness that were to fall upon
                  her path! And alas! how little does many a careless girl, who gives herself away,
                  thoughtlessly, to a young man of unformed character, dream of the sorrow too deep
                  for tears that awaits her. Surely this were anguish enough,—and surely it called
                  for the sustaining sympathy of friends. But the friend of her early years, the
                  sister in whose arms, in the days of innocent childhood, she had slept peacefully,
                  now turned from her coldly, and even repulsively.</p>
               <p>So unnatural and revolting seems the picture I am drawing, even in its dim
                  outlines, that I turn from it myself, half-resolved to leave it unfinished. But
                  many reasons, stronger than feeling, urge me to complete my task with the
                  imperfect skill I possess, and I take the pencil which I had laid down in shame
                  and disgust, and proceed to fill up more distinctly.</p>
               <p>I had observed for some time the growing coolness of Mrs. Williams towards her
                  unfortunate sister, and had noted more than once the deep dejection of Mrs.
                     Haller's<pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC5627-00000223"/> manner, whenever she went
                  away from our house. She began to come less and less frequently, and her children
                  at still more remote intervals. Things became desperate with her at length, and
                  she came, forced by necessity, to seek a little aid and comfort in her sorrow from
                  her once kind sister, and with the faint hope that some relief would be offered. I
                  was sitting in the neatly furnished breakfast-room, one evening, a little after
                  tea, reading a book, when Mrs Haller came in. She had on a dark calico dress,
                  faded, but clean, a rusty shawl that had once been black, and a bonnet that Mrs.
                  Williams's kitchen-servant would not have worn. My eye instinctively glanced to
                  the face of Mrs. Williams as she entered; it had at once contracted into a cold
                  and forbidding expression. She neither rose from her chair, nor asked Mrs. Haller
                  to take one, greeting her only with a chilling "well, Sally." The latter naturally
                  sought a chair, and waited silently, and surely with an aching heart, for a kinder
                  manifestation of sisterly regard. I immediately left the room; but learned
                  afterwards enough of the interview to make it distinct to the imagination of the
                  reader.</p>
               <p>The sisters sat silent for some moments, the one vainly trying to keep down the
                  struggling anguish of a stricken heart, and the other, half-angry at the
                  intrusion, endeavouring to fashion a form of greeting that should convey her real
                  impressions, without being verbally committed. At length the latter said,
                  half-kindly, half-repulsively:—</p>
               <p>"Why, Sally, what has brought you so far from home, after dark?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing very particular. Only I thought I would like to drop in a little while
                  and see how you all did. Besides, little Thomas is sick, and I wanted to get a few
                  herbs from you, as you always keep them."</p>
               <p>"What kind of herbs do you want?"</p>
               <p>"Only a few sprigs of balm, and some woodbitney."</p>
               <p>"Kitty"—bawled out this unfeeling woman to the servant in the kitchen—"go up into
                  the garret and bring me a handful of balm and woodbitney—and don't stay all
                  night!"</p>
               <p>"No, ma'am," said Kitty, thinking the last part of the order most requiring a
                  reply.</p>
               <p>A further pause of a few minutes ensued, when Mrs. Haller, after almost struggling
                  to keep silence, at length ventured to say, sadly, and despondingly, that she
                  should have to move again.</p>
               <p>"And what, in the name of heaven, Sally, are you going to move again for? You
                  can't be suited much better."</p>
               <p>"Nor much worse, either, Mary. But John has paid no rent, and we can't stay any
                  longer. The landlord has ordered us to leave by next Wednesday, or he will throw
                  our few things into the street."</p>
               <p>"Well, I declare, there is always something occurring with you to worry my mind.
                  Why do you constantly harass me with your troubles? I have enough at home in my
                  own family to perplex me, without being made to bear your burdens. I never trouble
                  you with my grievances, or anybody else, and do not think it kind in you to make
                  me feel bad every time you come here. I declare, I grow nervous whenever I see
                  you!"</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Haller, already bending beneath her burden, found this adding a weight
                  that made it past calm endurance, and she burst into tears, and sobbed aloud. But
                  not the slightest impression did this exhibition of sorrow make upon Mrs.
                  Williams. She even reproached her with unbecoming weakness.</p>
               <p>Although her sister had before shown indifference and great coolness, yet never
                  had she spoken thus unkindly. In a few moments Mrs. Haller regained her calmness,
                  and with it came back some of her former pride of feeling. For a moment she sat
                  with her eyes cast upon the floor, endeavouring to keep down her struggling
                  emotions; in the next she rose up, and looking her sister fixedly in the face,
                  read her this impressive lesson.</p>
               <p>"Mary, I could not have dreamed of such harshness from you! I have thought you
                  cold and indifferent, long; but I tried hard to believe that you were not unkind.
                  I have never come to see you in the last three years, that I did not go away sad
                  in spirit. There was something in your manner that seemed to say that you thought
                  my presence irksome, and as you were the only friend I had to speak to about my
                  wearying cares and anxieties, it grieved me more than I can tell to think that
                  that only friend was growing cold—and that friend a sister! As<pb n="446-447"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000224"/> things have become worse with me, your manner has
                  grown colder, and now you have spoken out distinctly, and destroyed the little
                  resting place I sometimes sought when wearied to faintness. Mary, may God who has
                  afflicted me, grant you a happier lot in the future! May you never know the
                  anguish of one who sees a once idolized husband become a brute—her children
                  growing up worthless under the dreadful example of their father, and all often
                  wanting food to sustain nature! You have everything you desire. I have not the
                  necessaries of life. We were born of the same mother, and nursed at the same
                  bosom. We played together in childhood,—once I saved your life. And now, because
                  our ways are different; yours even and flowery, and mine rough and thorny, you
                  turn from me, as from an importunate beggar. Mary, we shall meet our father and
                  mother at the bar of God!"</p>
               <p>Thus saying, Mrs. Haller turned slowly away, and left the house before her sister,
                  who was startled at this unexpected appeal, could sufficiently collect her senses
                  to reply. Her real errand, or, rather, her principal errand to the house of Mrs.
                  Williams, had been to ask for some food for her children. It was many weeks since
                  her husband had contributed a single dollar towards the daily family expenses, and
                  all the burden of their support devolved upon the wife and mother. Night and day,
                  in pain, and exhaustion of body and mind, had she toiled to get food for those who
                  looked up to her, but all her efforts were inadequate. Like thousands of others,
                  when a girl, she had acquired an education that was more ornamental than useful.
                  The consequence was, that she had no ready means of earning money. The wants of a
                  family of children, had, it is true, given her some skill with her needle, but not
                  of a kind that would enable her to earn much by sewing.</p>
               <p>She did, however, at first try what she could do by working for the cheap
                  clothing-stores. But twelve-and-a-half cents a pair for pantaloons, ten cents for
                  vests, and eight cents for shirts, yielded so little, that she was driven to
                  something else. That something else was the washtub; over which, and the
                  ironing-table, she toiled early and late, often ready to sink to the floor from
                  exhaustion. Of this, she said nothing to Mrs. Williams, who would have been
                  terribly mortified at the idea of her sister, taking in washing for a support.,
                  The labour of one pair of hands in the wash-tub, was, however, unequal to the task
                  of providing food for seven mouths, even of a very poor quality. Consequently,
                  Mrs. Haller found the wants of her family pressing, every day, harder and harder
                  upon the slender means by which they were supplied. Often, when she carried home
                  her work, there was no food in the house, and often did she work half the night,
                  so as to be able to take her clothes home early on the next day, and get the money
                  she had earned to meet that day's wants.</p>
               <p>Among those for whom she washed and ironed, was a woman in good circumstances, who
                  never paid her anything until she asked for it, and then the money came with an
                  air of reluctance. Of course, she applied to her for her hard earnings, only when
                  pressed by necessity. On the morning before the interview with her sister, just
                  detailed, Mrs. Haller found herself nearly out of everything, and with not a cent
                  in the world. The woman just alluded to, owed her two dollars, and she had nearly
                  completed another week's washing for her, which would make the amount due her two
                  dollars and a half. At dinner-time, every mouthful of food, and that a scanty
                  portion, was consumed, and there would be nothing for supper, or breakfast, on the
                  next morning, unless Mrs. Hamil should pay her. It was nearly night when she
                  finished ironing the last piece. Hurriedly putting on her things, after sending
                  two of her children with the clothes in a basket, she joined them as they were
                  about entering the dwelling of Mrs. Hamil.</p>
               <p>Her heart beat, audibly to her own ear, as she went in, and asked to see the woman
                  for whom she had been labouring. Although, heretofore, whenever she had asked for
                  her money, she had received it, sometimes with reluctance, it is true, yet her
                  extremity being now so great, she trembled lest, from some cause, she should not
                  be able to get the pittance due her.</p>
               <p>For a few moments she sat in the kitchen hesitating to ask for Mrs. Hamil, after
                  the clothes had been given to<pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC5627-00000225"/> the
                  servant. When she did do so, she was told that she was engaged and could not be
                  seen.</p>
               <p>"Ask her, then, for me, if you please," she said, to send me a dollar. I want it
                  very much."</p>
               <p>The servant went up and delivered her message, and in a few moments came back with
                  the answer, that Mrs. Hamil was engaged, and could not attend to such
                  matters;—that she could step in on the next day, and get her money.</p>
               <p>The words fell coldly upon her feelings, and oppressed her with a faint sickness.
                  Then she got up slowly from her chair, hesitated a moment, took one or two steps
                  towards the door, and then pausing, said to the servant,</p>
               <p>"Go up and tell Mrs. Hamil, that I am sorry to trouble her, but that I want the
                  money very much, and that if she will send it down to me, she will confer a very
                  great favour, indeed."</p>
               <p>"I had rather not," the servant replied. "She didn't appear pleased at my going up
                  the first time. And I am sure she will be less pleased if I go again."</p>
               <p>"But you do not know how much I am in want of this money, Jane—" and the poor
                  woman's voice quivered.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mrs. Haller, I will try again," the kind-hearted girl said, "but I can't
                  promise to be successful. Mrs. Hamil is very queer sometimes."</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Jane returned with a positive refusal. Mrs. Hamil couldn't and
                  wouldn't be troubled in that way.</p>
               <p>In a state of half-conscious, dreamy wretchedness, did Mrs. Haller turn her steps
                  slowly homewards. The shadows of evening were falling thickly around, adding a
                  deeper gloom to her feelings.</p>
               <p>"O, mother! I'm glad you've come. I'm so hungry!" cried one of her little ones,
                  springing to her side as she entered. "Won't we have supper soon, now?"</p>
               <p>This was too much for her, and she sank exhausted and almost fainting into a
                  chair. Tears soon brought temporary relief to an overburdened heart. Then she
                  soothed her hungry little ones as well as she could, promising them a good supper
                  before they went to bed.</p>
               <p>"But why can't we have it now?" urged one, more impatient, or more hungry, than
                  the rest.</p>
               <p>"Because mother hasn't got any good bread for little Henry—" she replied—"But she
                  will have some soon. So all be good children, and wait until mother goes out and
                  gets some bread and meat, and then we will all have a nice supper."</p>
               <p>After quieting the importunities of her children in this way, and soothing little
                  Thomas, who was sick and fretful, Mrs. Haller again left them, and bent her steps,
                  with a reluctant spirit, towards the comfortable dwelling of her sister, nearly a
                  mile away from where she lived. The interview with that sister has already been
                  given.</p>
               <p>When she turned away, as has been seen, empty-handed, from the door of that
                  sister, it was with feelings that few can imagine. It seemed to her as if she were
                  forsaken both of earth and heaven. How she got home, she hardly knew, but when she
                  entered that cheerless place she found her poor sick child, for whom she had no
                  money to buy medicine, burning with fever, and crying bitterly. Her brutal husband
                  was snoring on the bed the smaller children quarrelling among themselves, and her
                  oldest boy, half-intoxicated, leaning over the back of a chair, and swinging his
                  body backward and forward in the <choice>
                     <sic>idiotcy</sic>
                     <corr>idiocy</corr>
                  </choice> of drunkenness. As she entered, the children crowded round her, asking
                  fretfully for their suppers; but nothing had she to give them, for she had come
                  away empty-handed and repulsed from the door of her affluent sister, to whose
                  dwelling she had gone solely to ask for some food for her children! In the
                  momentary energy of despair she roused her husband rudely from the bed, and bade
                  him, in an excited tone, to go and get some bread for the children: The brute,
                  angered by her words and manner, struck her a blow upon the head, which brought
                  her senseless to the floor.</p>
               <p>An hour at least passed before she recovered her senses; when she opened her eyes,
                  she found herself on a bed, her sister sitting by her side, weeping, and Mr.
                  Williams standing over her. Her husband was not there, some of the children were
                  crying about the room, and others had fallen asleep on the floor. The oldest boy
                  was sitting in the position before-mentioned. Brief explanations were made, and
                  Mrs. Williams offered a faint apology for her harsh treatment. The appeal<pb
                     n="450-451" xml:id="VAC5627-00000226"/> of her sister had touched her feelings,
                  and she had proposed to Mr. Williams to go over and see her. On entering her
                  dwelling they found her senseless on the floor, and the children screaming around
                  her. The husband was not there.</p>
               <p>As soon as the mother's voice was heard by the smallest child, a little girl, she
                  climbed up the side of the bed, and simply, and earnestly, in lisping tones, asked
                  for a "piece of bread." The poor woman burst into tears, and turned her head away
                  from her child. Mrs. Williams went to the closet, saying—"Come, Emma, I will get
                  you some bread. "The little thing was at her side in a moment. But the search
                  there was in vain.</p>
               <p>"Where is the bread, Sally?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"There is none in the house," faintly murmured the almost broken-hearted
                  mother.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" said Mr. Williams—"you are not without food, surely?"</p>
               <p>"We have tasted nothing to-day," was the startling reply.</p>
               <p>"Where is Mr. Haller?"</p>
               <p>"I know not—he left the house a short time ago."</p>
               <p>"He ran out when he struck you, mother," spoke up the little child who had asked
                  for the bread.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Williams looked at each other for some moments in silence.</p>
               <p>"Get a basket and come with me, John," said Mr. Williams, to the oldest boy, who
                  was gazing on with indifference or stupidity.</p>
               <p>Mechanically he took a basket and followed his uncle. They soon returned with
                  bread, dried meat, ham, &amp;c., and in a brief space, a comfortable meal was
                  prepared for the starving family.</p>
               <p>Conscience felt about the heart of Mrs. Williams that night, with touches of pain,
                  and she repented of her cruel neglect, and unkind treatment of her sister. She
                  dreamed not of the extent of her destitution and misery—simply, because she had
                  refused to make herself acquainted with her real condition. Now that the sad
                  reality had been forced upon her almost unwilling eyes, a few returning impulses
                  of nature demanded relief for her suffering sister.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams, whose benevolent feelings were easily excited, was shocked at the
                  scene before him, and blamed himself severely for not having earlier become
                  acquainted with Mrs. Haller's condition. He immediately set about devising means
                  of relief. Haller had become so worthless that he despaired of making him do
                  anything for his family. He therefore invited his sister-in-law to come home to
                  our house, and bring her two youngest girls with her. The rest were provided with
                  places. The family had grown pretty large, and she could assist in sewing,
                  &amp;c., and thus render a service, and live comfortably. Mrs. Williams seconded
                  the proposition, though not with much cordiality; she could not, however, make any
                  objections.</p>
               <p>We look at the sisters now in a different relation. The superior in dependence on
                  the inferior. Can any for a moment question the result?</p>
               <p>It was not without a struggle that poor Mrs. Haller consented to disband her
                  little family—and virtually to divorce herself from her husband. No matter how
                  cruel the latter had been, nor how deplorable the condition of the former, her
                  heart still retained its household affections, and would not consent willingly to
                  have her little flock scattered-perhaps for ever. But stern necessity knows no
                  law. In due time, with little Emma, and Emily, Mrs. Haller was assigned a
                  comfortable room over the kitchen, and became a member of our family. All of us in
                  the shop felt for her a warm interest, but hesitated not to express among
                  ourselves a regret that she could do no better than to trust herself and little
                  ones to the tender mercies of a sister, whom we knew too well to respect.</p>
               <p>At first, Mrs. Haller was employed in needle-work, but as she was neither a very
                  fast nor neat sewer, her sister soon found it better policy to let her do the
                  chamber-work, and sometimes assist in cooking. For about three months, her
                  situation was comfortable, except that her children were required to act "just
                  so," and were driven about and scolded if they ventured to amuse themselves in the
                  yard, or anywhere in the sight or hearing of their aunt. Her own children were
                  indulged in almost everything, but her little nieces were required to be as staid
                  and circumspect as grown-up women. After about six<pb n="452-453"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000227"/> months had elapsed, Mrs. Williams began to find
                  fault with her sister for various trifles, and to be petulant and unkind in manner
                  towards her. This thing was not done right, and the other thing was neglected. If
                  she sat down for half an hour to sew for herself or children, something would be
                  said or hinted to wound her, and make her feel that she was viewed by her sister
                  in no other light than that of a hired servant.</p>
               <p>Something occurring to make the kitchen-servant leave her place, Mrs. Haller
                  cooked and attended in her situation until another could be obtained. There was,
                  however, no effort made to procure another; week after week passed away, and still
                  all the menial employments of the house and the hard duties of the kitchen fell
                  upon Mrs. Haller. From her place at the first table, where she sat for a short
                  time after she came into the house, she was assigned one with us. To all these
                  changes she was not indifferent. She felt them keenly. But what could she do?
                  Unfortunately for her, she had been so raised (as too many of our poor, proud,
                  fashionable girls are now raised) as to be almost helpless when thrown upon her
                  own resources. She was industrious, and saving; but understood nothing about
                  getting a living. Therefore, she felt that endurance was her only present course.
                  It was grievous to the heart to be trampled upon by a sister whose condition was
                  above her's; but as that sister had offered her an <choice>
                     <sic>assylum</sic>
                     <corr>asylum</corr>
                  </choice>, when in the utmost destitution, she resolved to bear patiently the
                  burden she imposed upon her.</p>
               <p>It was now tacitly understood between the sisters that Sally was to be
                  kitchen-servant to the other. And as a servant she was treated. When company were
                  at the house, she was not to know them or sit down in the parlour with them. Her
                  little ones were required to keep themselves out of the family sitting-room, and
                  Mrs. Williams's children taught, not by words, but by actions, to look upon them
                  as inferiors. From confinement, and being constantly checked in the outburst of
                  their feelings, they soon began to look much worse than they did when first taken
                  from their comfortless abode. The youngest, a quiet child, might usually be found
                  sitting on a little stool by her mother in the kitchen, playing with some trifling
                  toy; but the other was a wild little witch, who was determined to obey no
                  arbitrary laws of her aunt's enacting. There was no part of the house that she did
                  not consider neutral ground. Now she would be playing with her little cousins in
                  the breakfast-room, or in some of the chambers, and now clambering over the
                  shop-board among the boys and journeymen. All liked her but Mrs. Williams, and to
                  her she was a thorn in the flesh, because she set at defiance all her
                  restrictions. This was a cause of much trouble to Mrs. Haller, who saw that the
                  final result would be a separation from one or both of her children. The only
                  reason that weighed with her and caused her to remain in her unpleasant and
                  degraded situation, was the ardent desire she felt to keep her two youngest
                  children with her. She could not trust them to the tender mercies of strangers.
                  Deep distress and abject poverty had not blunted a single maternal feeling, and
                  her heart yearned for her babes with an increased anxiety and tenderness as the
                  chances every day appeared less in favour of her retaining them with her. One had
                  nearly grown up, and was a sorrow and an anguish to her heart. Two others, quite
                  young, were bound out, and but one of them had found a kind guardian. And now, one
                  of the two that remained she feared would have to be removed from her.</p>
               <p>One day, her sister called her into the sitting-room, where she found a lady of no
                  very prepossessing appearance.</p>
               <p>"Sally," said she, "this is Mrs. Tompkins. She has seen Emily, and would like to
                  have her very much. You, of course, have no objections to getting so good a place
                  for Emily. How soon can you get her ready to go? Mrs. Tompkins would like to have
                  her by the first of next week."</p>
               <p>Thus, without a moment's warning, the dreaded blow fell upon her. She murmured a
                  faint assent, named an early day, and retired. She could not resist the will of
                  her sister, for she was a dependant.</p>
               <p>In the disposition of other people's children, we can be governed by what we call
                  rational considerations; but when called upon to part with our own helpless
                  offspring, how differently do we estimate circumstances! Every<pb n="454-455"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000228"/> day we hear some one saying, "Why don't she put out
                  her children?"—and, "Why don't she put out her children? They will be much better
                  off." And perhaps these children are but eight, nine, and ten years old. Mother!
                  father! whoever you may be, imagine your own children, of that tender age, among
                  strangers as servants (for that is the capacity of children who are thus put out)
                  required to be, in all respects, as prudent, as industrious, as renouncing of
                  little recreations and pleasures as men and women, and subject to severe
                  punishments for all childish faults and weaknesses, such as you would have borne
                  with and gently corrected. Don't draw parallels between your own and poor people's
                  children, as if they were to be less regarded than yours. Even as your heart
                  yearns over and loves with unspeakable tenderness your offspring, does the mother,
                  no matter how poor her condition, yearn over and love her children—and when they
                  are removed from under her protecting wing, she feels as keen a sorrow as would
                  rend your heart, were the children of your tenderest care and fondest love, taken
                  from you and placed among strangers.</p>
               <p>In due time, Emily was put out to Mrs. Tompkins, a woman who had wonderful fine
                  notions about rearing up children so as to make men and women of them, (than her
                  own, there were not a more graceless set in the whole city.) She had never been
                  able to carry into full practice her admirable theories in regard to the education
                  of children among her own hopefuls; because—first: Johnny was a very delicate boy,
                  and to have governed him by strict rules, would have been to have ruined his
                  constitution. She had never dared to break him of screaming by conquering him, in
                  a single instance, because the rupture of a blood-vessel would doubtless have been
                  the consequence, or a fit in which he might have died. Once indeed she did try to
                  force him to give up his will, but he grew black in the face from passion, and she
                  had hard work to recover him—after this he was humoured in everything. And Tommy
                  was a high-spirited and generous fellow, and it would have been a pity to warp his
                  fine disposition. Years of discretion would make him a splendid specimen of
                  perfect manhood. Angelina, (a forward, pert little minx,) was, from her birth, so
                  gentle, so amiable, so affectionate, that no government was necessary—and
                  Victorine was so naturally high-tempered, that her mother guarded against the
                  developement of anger by never allowing her to be crossed in anything.</p>
               <p>In Emily, Mrs. Tompkins supposed she had found a fine subject on which to
                  demonstrate her theories. A wilful, spoiled child, she was, eleven years of age,
                  and needed curbing, and in a few days Mrs. Tompkins found it necessary to exercise
                  her prerogative. Emily was, of course, put right to work, so soon as she came into
                  the house. Her first employment was to sweep up the breakfast-room, after the maid
                  had removed the breakfast-things and placed back the table. She had never handled
                  a broom, and was, of course, very awkward. With this awkwardness, Mrs. Tompkins
                  had no patience, and once or twice took the broom from her hand, and directed her
                  how to hold and use it, in a high tone, and half-angry manner. In due course she
                  got through this duty; and then was directed to rock the cradle, while Mrs.
                  Tompkins went through her chamber and made herself look a little tidy. Sitting
                  still a whole hour was a terrible trial to Emily's patience, but she made out to
                  stick at her post until Mrs. Tompkins re-appeared. She was then sent into the
                  cellar to bring up three or four armfuls of wood, and immediately after to the
                  grocer's for a pound of soap, then to the milliner's with a band-box. When she
                  returned, it was about eleven o'clock, and she was set to help one of the servants
                  wash the windows, which were taken out of the frames and washed in the yard. This
                  occupied until twelve. Then she must rock the cradle again, which she did until
                  one o'clock, when it waked, and she had to sit on a little chair and hold it,
                  while the family dined. Her own dinner was afterwards put on a plate, and she made
                  to stand by the kitchen-table and eat it. All the afternoon was taken up in some
                  employment or other, and as soon as supper was over (which she eat, as before,
                  standing at the kitchen-table) she was sent to bed—and glad she was to get there,
                  for she was so tired she could hardly stand up.</p>
               <p>The next day passed in the same unrelaxing round of duties, and the third
                  commenced in a similar way. The little thing had by this time become almost sick
                  from such<pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC5627-00000229"/> constant confinement and
                  extra labour for one of her strength. She was set, on this day, to scrub down a
                  pair of back stairs, a task to which she was unequal. Before she had got down to
                  the third step, she accidentally upset the basin and flooded the whole
                  stair-case—dashing the dirty-water in the face of Mrs. Tompkins who was just
                  coming up. She was a good deal frightened, for Mrs. Tompkins had shown so much
                  anger towards her on different occasions in the last three days, and had once
                  threatened to correct her, that she feared punishment would follow the accident. A
                  slight box on the ear was indeed administered. Trembling from head to foot with
                  fear, and weakness, for the child was by no means well, she brought up another
                  basin of water, and commenced scouring the steps again. By some strange fatality,
                  the basin was again upset, and unfortunately fell in the face of Mrs. Tompkins
                  again. A cruel chastisement followed, with a set of leather thongs, upon the poor
                  child's bare back and shoulders.</p>
               <p>That night the child came home to her mother, and gave a history of her treatment.
                  Her lacerated back was sufficient evidence how cruelly she had been punished. The
                  little thing was in a high fever, and moaned and talked in her sleep all
                  night.</p>
               <p>Finding that the child was not sent back in the morning, Mrs. Williams wished to
                  know the reason, and was told the real condition of Emily.</p>
               <p>"She's a bad child, Sally, and has no doubt deserved a whipping! You have spoiled
                  your older children by mistaken kindness, and will spoil the rest. But I can tell
                  you very distinctly that I am not going to be a party in this matter, and will not
                  consent that Emily stay here any longer. So, if you don't send her back to Mrs.
                  Tompkins, you may get her a place somewhere else, for after this week she shall
                  not stay here. She has almost ruined my Clara, now!"</p>
               <p>To this, poor Mrs. Haller made no reply. Her home at our house had only been
                  endured because there she thought she could keep her babes with her. She left the
                  presence of her unfeeling sister, and began to study how she could manage to
                  support herself and two children by her own unaided exertions. Many plans were
                  suggested to her mind, but none seemed to promise success. At length she resolved
                  to rent a small room, and put into it a bed, a table, and a few chairs, with some
                  other necessary articles which she still had, and then buy some kind of vegetables
                  with about five dollars that were due her, and go to market as a huckster! Let not
                  the sentimental and romantic turn away in disgust. When humanity is reduced to a
                  last resource, be it what it may, the heart endures pains, and doubts, and fears
                  of a like character, whether the resource be that offered to a noble lady, or a
                  lonely widow.</p>
               <p>Before Saturday night, Mrs. Haller had found a room near the market that just
                  suited her, which she rented at two dollars a month with the use of the cellar.
                  When she made known to Mrs. Williams her intention of leaving her house, and told
                  her how she intended to make a living, the latter was almost speechless with
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"Surely, Sally," said she, "you cannot be in earnest?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I am in earnest, though?"</p>
               <p>"But consider the disgrace it will be to your family."</p>
               <p>"Nothing is disgraceful that is honest."</p>
               <p>"I never will consent to your being a huckster:—Sally! if you do so disgrace
                  yourself as to stand in the market and sell potatoes and cabbages, I will disown
                  you! You have a comfortable home here, and where then is the use of your exposing
                  yourself in the market-house?"</p>
               <p>"You will not let Emily stay here with me, and I cannot part with my poor babes."
                  A flood of tears burst forth, even though she struggled hard to conceal them.</p>
               <p>"You are very weak and foolish, Sally. Emily will be much better off, away from
                  you. She is growing up a spoiled child, and needs other care than yours. You are
                  too indulgent."</p>
               <p>"In any case, Mary, I am determined to keep these children with me. I know that it
                  is not pleasant for you to have them here, and I don't want to have them in your
                  way. The best thing I can do is that which I have determined on."</p>
               <p>"If you will go, why not take in sewing, or washing and ironing?"</p>
               <p>"Simply, because I cannot make a living with my needle, and my health will not
                  permit me to stand over the<pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC5627-00000230"/> wash-tub
                  from morning till night. There is no resource left me but the market-house,
                  reluctantly as I go there."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sally, you can do as you please. But let me tell you, that if you do turn
                  huckster, I will never own you as my sister again."</p>
               <p>"Any such foolish and rash resolution on your part, I should regret very much;
                  for, unkindly and unfeelingly as you have acted towards me, I have no wish to
                  dissolve the tie of nature."</p>
               <p>"It shall be dissolved, you may rely upon it, if you do so disgraceful a
                  thing."</p>
               <p>On Saturday she got what was due to her, and on Monday removed to her new abode.
                  Of all this, Mr. Williams had not the slightest knowledge. After getting her room
                  fixed up, she went down to the wharf and bought a few bushels of potatoes, and
                  some apples: with these she went to the market. Her feelings in thus exposing
                  herself, can only be imagined by such as have had to resort to a similar method of
                  obtaining a livelihood, when they first appeared in the market-house. She had not
                  been long at her stand, when Mr. Williams, who generally went to market, came
                  unexpectedly upon her.</p>
               <p>"Why, Sally, what in the world are you doing here?" was his surprised
                  salutation.</p>
               <p>"Why, didn't you know that I had left your house for the market-house?"</p>
               <p>"No! How should I know You never told me that you were going.</p>
               <p>"But surely sister did?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed she did not."</p>
               <p>"She knew last week that I was going, and that I had determined to make a living
                  for myself and children in this way."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry you left our house, Sally! You should have had a home there as long as
                  I lived. You must not stay here, anyhow. Something better can be done for you.
                  Surely you and Mary have not quarrelled?"</p>
               <p>"She has renounced me for ever!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams was a good deal shocked by this unexpected interview, and when he
                  went home inquired into the state of affairs. He censured his wife severely for
                  her part in the matter, upon her own statement; and told her plainly that she had
                  not treated Sally as a sister should have been treated. He went to see Mrs. Haller
                  that day, and used many arguments to induce her to come back, or at least to give
                  up her newly-adopted calling.</p>
               <p>"Put me in a better and more comfortable way of making a living, Mr. Williams,"
                  was her answer—"and I will most gladly adopt it. I know of no other that will suit
                  me. I cannot longer remain dependent. In your house I was dependent, and daily and
                  hourly I was made to feel that dependence, in the most galling manner.</p>
               <p>By her first day's efforts in the market-house, Mrs. Haller earned three-quarters
                  of a dollar, with which she bought food for herself and children, and re-invested
                  the original amount. On the next day, as on the first, she disposed of her whole
                  stock, and was so fortunate in her sales as to clear one dollar. On the next day
                  she did not sell more than half of her little stock, and cleared only
                  thirty-seven-and-a-half cents on that. Greatly discouraged she went home at twelve
                  o'clock, and was still further cast down at finding her husband there, come to
                  take up his lodgings, and eat up her meagre earnings from her children. She
                  remonstrated against his coming back, but with drunken oath and cruel threats he
                  let her know that he should stay there in spite of her. Before night, her oldest
                  son, a worthless vagabond, also made his appearance, and between them swept off
                  all the food, that she had bought with the profits on her five dollars, which she
                  had resolved from the first not to break. On the next morning she cleared a full
                  dollar, and on Saturday, another. But her increased family prevented her adding a
                  cent of the profits to her original capital. After the market on Saturday morning,
                  she went out and bought about three dollars worth of eggs, at ten cents a dozen,
                  which, before night, she sold at twelve-and-a-half cents, thus clearing
                  twenty-five cents on the dollar, or three-quarters of a dollar in all. With a
                  dollar and three-quarters that she had made that day, she laid in a supply of
                  common and substantial food.</p>
               <p>On Sunday she went, as was her custom, to church, and took her two little girls
                  with her. Her husband and son remained at home. When she returned from service
                  they were gone; instinctively turning to where she had concealed her little
                  treasure, of five dollars, she found that it had also disappeared! She knew well
                  how to<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC5627-00000231"/> account for its loss. Her
                  husband and son had robbed her! The little hope that had animated her breast for
                  the last few days, gave way, and she sunk down into a condition of mind that was
                  almost despair. Towards evening, her husband and son came home drunk, and lay all
                  night stupid. In the morning, they stole off by day-light, and she was left alone
                  with her little ones, to brood over her melancholy prospect. She could not, of
                  course, go to market, for she had nothing to sell, nor anything with which to
                  purchase a little stock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams, who felt a lively interest in her case, especially on account of the
                  unkind treatment she had received from his wife, used to stop and inquire into her
                  prospects whenever he saw her in the market, and had been looking round for
                  something better for her to do. Missing her this morning, he went to her house,
                  and there found her in a state of complete despondency. He encouraged her in the
                  best way he could, but did not advance her another little capital, which he would
                  willingly have done under other circumstances, and then went away, determined to
                  get her some situation which would be more suitable for one of her habits and
                  feelings.</p>
               <p>Not an hour after he learned that a head nurse was much wanted at the alms-house.
                  He made immediate application for her, and was happy in securing the place. It was
                  at once offered to her, and she accepted it with gladness, especially as she would
                  be allowed to bring her two children with her. In due time, she removed to her new
                  abode, and soon won the good-will and kind consideration of the Board of Trustees,
                  and the affectionate regards of those to whose afflictions she was called to
                  minister. Her two little girls were educated at the alms-house school, and grew up
                  amiable, intelligent, and industrious. Of her other children, I never knew
                  much.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Williams seemed to think the situation of her sister at the alms-house,
                  almost as disgraceful as her place in the market. She never renewed a
                  communication with her. Even up to the hour when Mrs. Haller was called to her
                  final account, which was many years after, her sister neither saw nor spoke to
                  her.</p>

               <head>THE MAIDEN'S ERROR.</head>
               <p>THE story of Julia Forrester is but a revelation of what occurs every day. I draw
                  aside the veil for a moment, would that some one might gaze with trembling on the
                  picture, and be saved!</p>
               <p>The father of Julia had served an apprenticeship to the tanning and currying
                  business. He had been taken when an orphan boy of twelve years old, by a man in
                  this trade, and raised by him, without any of the benefits of education. At
                  twenty-one he could read and write a little, but had no taste for improving his
                  mind. His master, being well pleased with him for his industry and sobriety,
                  offered him a small interest in his business, shortly after he was free, which
                  soon enabled him to marry, and settle himself in life.</p>
               <p>His new companion was the daughter of a reduced tradesman; she had high notions of
                  gentility, but possessed more vanity and love of admiration than good sense.
                  Neither of them could comprehend the true relation of parents. If they fed their
                  children well, clothed them well, and sent them to the most reputable schools,
                  they imagined that they had, in part, discharged their duty; and, wholly, when
                  they had obtained good-looking and well-dressed husbands for their daughters. This
                  may be a little exaggerated; but such an inference might readily have been drawn
                  by one who attentively considered their actions.</p>
               <p>I shall not spend further time in considering their characters. Their counterpart
                  may be found in every street, and in every neighbourhood. The curious student of
                  human nature can study them at will. Julia Forrester was the child of such
                  parents. When she was fifteen, they were in easy circumstances. But at that
                  critical period of their daughter's life, they were ignorant of human nature, and
                  entirely unskilled in the means of detecting false pretension, or discovering true
                     merit.<pb n="462-463" xml:id="VAC5627-00000232"/> Indeed, they were much more
                  ready to consider the former as true, and the latter as false. The unpretending
                  modesty of real worth they generally mistook for imbecility, or a consciousness of
                  questionable points of character; while bold-faced assurance was thought to be an
                  open exhibition of manliness—the free, undisguised manner of those who had nothing
                  to conceal.</p>
               <p>It is rarely that a girl of Julia's age, but little over fifteen, possesses much
                  insight into character. It was enough for her that her parents invited young men
                  to the house, or permitted them to visit her. Her favour, or dislike, was founded
                  upon mere impulse, or the caprice of first impressions. Among her earliest
                  visitors, was a young man of twenty-two, clerk in a dry-goods' store. He had an
                  open, prepossessing manner, but had indulged in vicious habits for many years, and
                  was thoroughly unprincipled. His name I will call Warburton. Another visitor was a
                  modest, sensible young man, also clerk in another dry-goods' store. He was correct
                  in all his habits, and inclined to be religious. He had no particular end in view
                  in visiting at Forrester's, more than to mingle in society. Still, as he continued
                  his visits, he began to grow fond of Julia, notwithstanding her extreme youth. The
                  fact was, she had shot up suddenly into a graceful woman; and her manners were
                  really attractive. Little could be gleaned, however, in her society, or in that of
                  but few who visited her, from the current chit-chat. It was all chaffy stuff,—mere
                  small-talk. Let me introduce the reader to their more particular acquaintance.
                  There is assembled at Mr. Forrester's a gay social party, such as met there almost
                  every week. It is in the summer time. The windows are thrown open, and the
                  passers-by can look in upon the light-hearted group, at will. Warburton and Julia
                  are trifling in conversation, and the others are wasting. the moments as
                  frivolously as possible. We will join them without ceremony.</p>
               <p>"A more beautiful ring than this on your finger, I have never seen. Do you know
                  why a ring is used in marriage?"</p>
               <p>"La! no, Mr. Warburton. Do tell me."</p>
               <p>"Why, because it is an emblem of love, which has neither beginning nor end."</p>
               <p>"And how will you make that out, Sir Oracle? ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>"Why as plain as a pike-staff. True love has no beginning; for those who are to be
                  married love each other before they meet. And it cannot have an end. So you see
                  that a ring is the emblem of love."</p>
               <p>"That's an odd notion; where did you pick it up?"</p>
               <p>"I picked it up nowhere. It is a cherished opinion of my own, and I believe in it
                  as firmly as some of the Jews of old did in the transmigration of souls."</p>
               <p>"You are a queer body."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I <emph>have</emph> got some queer notions; so people say: but I think I am
                  right, and those who don't agree with me, wrong. A mere difference of opinion,
                  however. All things are matters of opinion. Aint it so, Perkins?" addressing the
                  young man before alluded to.</p>
               <p>"What were you talking about?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I was just saying to Julia that all different ideas entertained by different
                  persons, were differences of opinion merely."</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say, that there is no such thing as truth, or error?"</p>
               <p>"I do—in the abstract."</p>
               <p>"Then we differ, of course—and as it would be, according to your estimation, a
                  mere difference of opinion, no argument on the subject would be in place
                  here."</p>
               <p>"Of course not," replied Warburton, rather coolly, and dropped the subject. Julia
                     <emph>almost</emph> saw that Warburton had made himself appear foolish in the
                  eyes of the dull, insipid Perkins—but her mental vision was closed up as firmly as
                  ever, in a moment.</p>
               <p>A loud burst of laughter from a group at the other end of the room, drew the
                  attention of the company, who flocked to the scene of mirth, and soon all were
                  chattering and laughing in a wild and incoherent manner, so loud as to attract the
                  notice of persons in the street.</p>
               <p>"Ha! he! he!" laughed a young lady, hysterically, sinking into a chair, with her
                  handkerchief to her mouth—"what a droll body!"</p>
               <p>"He-a, he-a, he-o-o-o," more boisterously roared out a fun-loving chap, who knew
                  more about good living than<pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC5627-00000233"/> good
                  manners. And so the laugh passed round. The cause of all this uproar, was a merry
                  fellow, who had made a rabbit out of one of the girl's handkerchiefs, and was
                  springing it from his hand against the wall. He seemed to have a fair appreciation
                  of the character of his associates for the evening; and though himself perfectly
                  competent to behave well in the best society, chose to act the clown in this.</p>
               <p>In due course, order was restored, more from the appearance of a waiter with nuts
                  and raisins, than from an natural reaction.</p>
               <p>"Name my apple, Mr. Perkins,"—(don't smile, reader—it's a true picture)—whispered
                  a young lady to the young man sitting next her.</p>
               <p>"It is named."</p>
               <p>"Name my apple, Mr. Collins," said Julia, with a nod and a smile.</p>
               <p>"It is named."</p>
               <p>"And mine, Mr. Collins"—"And mine, Mr. Warburton"—"And mine, Mr. Jones."</p>
               <p>The apples being eaten, the important business of counting seed came next in
                  order.</p>
               <p>"How many have you got, Julia?"</p>
               <p>"Six."</p>
               <p>"She loves!"</p>
               <p>"Who is it, Mr. Collins?" asked two or three voices.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Warburton," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"I thought so, I thought so,—see how she blushes."</p>
               <p>And in fact the red blood was mounting fast to Julia's face.</p>
               <p>The incident escaped neither the eye of Warburton nor of Perkins. To go through
                  the whole insipid scene would not interest any reader, and so we will omit it.</p>
               <p>After the apples were eaten, "hull-gull,"—"nuts in my hand," &amp;c., were played,
                  and then music was called for</p>
               <p>"Miss Simmons, give us an air, if you please."</p>
               <p>"Indeed you must excuse me, I am out of practice."</p>
               <p>"No excuse can be taken. We all know that you can play, and we must hear you this
                  evening."</p>
               <p>"I would willingly oblige the company, but I have not touched the piano for two
                  months, and cannot play fit to be heard."</p>
               <p>"O, never mind, we'll be the judges of that."</p>
               <p>"Come, Miss Simmons, do play for us now, that's a good soul!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed you must excuse me!"</p>
               <p>But no excuse would be taken. And in spite of protestations, she was forced to
                  take a seat at the piano.</p>
               <p>"Well, since I must, I suppose I must. What will you have."</p>
               <p>"Give us 'Bonny Doon'— it is so sweet and melancholy," said an interesting-looking
                  young man.</p>
               <p>"'Charlie over the Water,' is beautiful—I dote on that pong; do sing it, Miss
                  Simmons!"</p>
               <p>"Give us Auld Lang Syne.'"</p>
               <p>"Yes, or Burns's Farewell.'"</p>
               <p>"'Oft in the Stilly Night,' Miss Simmons—you can sing that."</p>
               <p>"Yes, 'Oft in the Stilly Night,'—Miss Simmons," said half-a-dozen voices, and so
                  that was finally chosen. After running her fingers over the keys for a few
                  moments, Miss Simmons started off.</p>
               <p>Before she had half finished the first verse, the hum of voices, which had
                  commenced as soon as she began to sing, rose to such a pitch as almost to drown
                  the sound of the instrument. She laboured on through about a verse and a half of
                  the song, when she rose from the piano, and was proceeding to her vacant seat.</p>
               <p>"O no!—no!—no!" said half-a-dozen voices at once.</p>
               <p>"That will never do-we must have another song."</p>
               <p>"Indeed I can't sing to-night, and <emph>must</emph> be excused," said the lady
                  warmly, and so she <emph>was</emph> excused. But soon another was chosen to be
                  victimized at the piano, and "will-ye-nill-ye," sing she must. Simultaneous with
                  the sound of the instrument rose the hum of voices, which grew louder and louder,
                  until the performer stopped, discouraged and chagrined.</p>
               <p>"That's beautiful! How well you play, Miss Emma!" and Miss Emma was forced to
                  resume the seat she had left half in mortification. All was again still for a
                  moment.</p>
               <p>"Can you play the 'Harp and Lute,' Miss Emma?"</p>
               <p>"No sir."</p>
               <p>"Yes you can, though, for I've heard you many a<pb n="466-467"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000234"/> time," said a smart young lady sitting on the
                  opposite side of the room.</p>
               <p>The blood mounted to the performer's cheeks. "Indeed you're mistaken though," half
                  pettishly replied Miss Emma.</p>
               <p>"But you <emph>can</emph> play 'Yankee Doodle,'" retorted the first speaker. Miss
                  Emma left the instrument in anger.</p>
               <p>"I'll never speak to the pert minx again as long as I live," whispered Miss Emma
                  in the ear of a friend.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the musical exhibition for that evening. As the spirit of wine grew
                  more active, the men became less formal in their attentions, and the young ladies
                  less reserved. Before the company broke up, I almost blush to say, that there was
                  scarcely a lady present who had not suffered her red-ripe lips to be touched by
                  those of every young man in the room. And on all these proceedings, the parents of
                  Julia looked on with keen satisfaction! They liked to see the young people
                  enjoying themselves!</p>
               <p>Then there were rambles by moonlight, during which soft things were whispered in
                  the ears of the young ladies. These were the occasions on which Warburton loved
                  most to steal away the fond confidence of Julia; and, by degrees, he succeeded in
                  fixing her regard upon himself. Consent was asked of the parents, and given; and
                  soon Julia Forrester was Mrs. Warburton. It was only six months after the marriage
                  that a commercial crisis arrived; one of those reactions from prosperity which
                  occur in this country with singular regularity, every ten or fifteen years, and
                  swept from Julia's father the whole of his property. This sudden revulsion so
                  preyed upon his mind, that a serious illness came on, which hurried him in a brief
                  period to the grave. The mother of Julia soon followed him. Warburton, ere this,
                  had neglected his wife, and wrung from her many a secret tear. He had married her
                  for the prospect of worldly gain which the connection held out, and not from any
                  genuine regard. And when all hope of a fortune was suddenly cut off, he as
                  suddenly appeared in his real character of a heartless and unprincipled man.</p>
               <p>He held the situation of clerk, at the time, in the same store where he had been
                  for years. But immediately upon the death of his father-in-law, a flood of demands
                  for debts due here and there came in upon him, and not having where with to meet
                  them, he was thrown into jail, and obtained his freedom only by availing himself
                  of the law made and provided for the benefit of Insolvent Debtors.</p>
               <p>His poor wife knew nothing of the proceedings against him, until he was lodged in
                  the jail. Hour after hour had passed since the time for his return to dinner, and
                  yet she listened in vain for his well-known footsteps. She felt strangely
                  oppressed in feeling when the dim twilight came stealing sadly on, and still he
                  came not home. But when the clock struck nine, ten, eleven,—her distress of mind
                  became heightened to agony. The question, so often asked of herself, "Where
                     <emph>can</emph> he be?" could find no answer. All night long she sat listening
                  at the window, and sunk into a heavy slumber, just as the grey light of morning
                  stole into the window and paled the expiring lamp. From this slumber, which had
                  continued for nearly two hours, she was aroused by the entrance of a servant, who
                  handed her a note, addressed in the well-known hand of her husband. Tremblingly
                  she tore open the seal; at the first words: <q>
                     <p>Jail.</p>
                     <p>DEAR JULIA:</p>
                  </q> the note fell from her hand, and she pressed her aching head for a moment, as
                  if she feared that her senses would leave her. Then snatching up the paper, she
                  read:— <q>
                     <floatingText>
                        <body>
                           <div type="letter">
                              <p>"Yesterday I was sent here for debt. I owe more than I can possibly
                                 pay, and I see no chance of getting out but by availing myself of
                                 the Insolvent Law, which I am determined to do. Don't let it
                                 trouble you, Julia; I shall not be here long. To-morrow I shall
                                 probably be at liberty. Good-bye, and keep a brave heart,</p>

               </p>
               <p>For some time after reading this letter, a stupor came over her senses. Utterly
                  unprepared for such a distressing event, she knew not how to act. The idea of a
                  jail had ever been associated in her mind with disgrace and crime, and to think
                  that her own husband was in jail almost bereft her of rational thought. Slowly,
                  however, she at length rallied, and found herself able to appreciate her
                  situation, and to think more clearly on her course of action.<pb n="468-469"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000235"/> Her first determination was to go to her husband.
                  This she immediately did. When admitted, she fell senseless in his arms, and it
                  was a long time before she recovered her consciousness. Her presence seemed to
                  move his feelings less than it annoyed him. There was nothing about his manner
                  that sought affectionately her sympathy and confidence—that which gives woman, in
                  situations no matter how distressing, something so much like happiness to bestow.
                  He gave her but little satisfaction as to the manner in which he became involved,
                  and when, after several hours, she prepared to go home, at his suggestion, he told
                  her that she must not come there again, as it was not a fit place for her.</p>
               <p>"If you are here, Henry," was her reply, the tears starting freshly to her
                  eyes—"it is a fit place for me."</p>
               <p>"That's all nonsense and sentiment, Julia! This is no place for you, and you must
                  not come again. I shall be out in a day or two."</p>
               <p>"A day or two is a long—long time,"—and the poor wife's voice trembled as she
                  spoke.</p>
               <p>"It will soon pass away."</p>
               <p>"It will seem ages to me, and you in this dreadful place. I must come tomorrow,
                  Henry. Tell me who has imprisoned you, and I will go to him, and come to-morrow
                  with his answer. He cannot stand the pleadings of a wife for her husband."</p>
               <p>"It's no use, at all, Julia. He is a hard-faced villain, and will insult you if
                  you see him."</p>
               <p>"He cannot—he dare not!"</p>
               <p>"He dare do anything."</p>
               <p>"Dear Henry, tell me his name."</p>
               <p>"No!—no!—no!—It's no use to ask me."</p>
               <p>She had many times before suffered from his petulance and coldness; but under
                  present circumstances, when she sought to bring him sympathy and relief, to be
                  repulsed, seemed as though it would break her heart. Slowly and in tears did she
                  leave the dreadful place that confined her husband, and sought her home. There she
                  endeavoured to rally her scattered thoughts, and devise some means of relief. Her
                  first movement was to go to the employers of her husband. They received her
                  coldly, and after she had stated the condition of her husband, told her that they
                  could offer no relief, and hinted that his conduct had been such as to forfeit
                  their confidence. This was a double blow; and she returned home with but strength
                  enough to seek her chamber and throw herself, almost fainting, upon her bed.</p>
               <p>For hours she lay in a kind of nervous stupor, the most fantastic and troubled
                  images floating through her brain. Sometimes she would start up, at the imagined
                  sound of her husband's voice, and spring to the chamber-door to meet him. But the
                  chilling reality would drive her back in tears. Where now were the crowds of
                  friends that but a short time since had hovered round her? They were but
                  fashionable, soulless insects—the cold winds of adversity had swept them away.
                  Since the failure and death of her father, not one of the many who had called her
                  friend had come near her lonely dwelling. But she could not complain. More than
                  one friend had she deserted, when misfortune came suddenly upon them.</p>
               <p>She took no food through the whole of that dreadful day, and could find no
                  oblivious sleep during the night of agony that followed. On the next day, just as
                  she had determined to go again to the prison, her quick ear recognised the
                  foot-fall of her husband. She sprang to meet him, with a gladder heart than she
                  had known for many weeks—but his cold manner and brief words threw back upon her
                  feelings a sickening chill.</p>
               <p>"We must move from here, Julia," said he, after a few silent moments, and looked
                  at her as though he expected objection as a matter of course.</p>
               <p>"I am willing, if it is necessary, Henry. I will go anywhere with
                  <emph>you</emph>."</p>
               <p>Her manner softened his feelings, and he said more tenderly,</p>
               <p>"Things are changed with me, Julia. In expectation of something handsome from your
                  father, I have been imprudent, and am now largely in debt. The Messrs. R. &amp; L.
                  will not, I am sure, take me back into their store, and it will be hard, I am
                  afraid, for me to get a situation in town. Our furniture, which I have secured to
                  you, is all we have, except about money enough to pay our quarter's rent now due.
                  I see no wiser plan for us than to sell this furniture, except enough for one
                  chamber, and then go to<pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC5627-00000236"/> boarding. It
                  will bring a sum sufficient to pay our board and other expenses for at least one
                  year, if we manage prudently; and, surely, I can get something to do in the mean
                  time."</p>
               <p>"I am willing for anything, dear Henry!" said his wife, twining her arms about his
                  neck, and laying her pale cheek to his. The furniture was accordingly sold, and
                  the reduced and humbled couple removed to a boardinghouse.</p>
               <p>As he had expected, Warburton found it hard to get employment. Finally, after
                  doing nothing for two months, he accepted the situation of bar-keeper at one of
                  the city hotels. Julia pleaded hard with him not to go there, for she feared the
                  influence of such a place upon him, but he would listen to no argument.</p>
               <p>His wife soon began to observe indications of a change for the worse in his
                  character. He grew more pettish and dissatisfied, and frequently acted towards her
                  with great unkindness. He was rarely, if ever, at home before midnight, and then
                  repulsed every affectionate act or word. Several times he came in intoxicated, and
                  once, while in that state, he struck her a severe blow on the head, which caused
                  an illness of several weeks.</p>
               <p>At the end of a year, Warburton had not only become dissipated in his habits, but
                  had connected himself with a set of gamblers, who, as he proved to be a skilful
                  hand, and not at all squeamish, resolved to send him on a trip down the Ohio and
                  Mississippi, to New Orleans, for mutual benefit. To this he had not the slightest
                  objection. He told his wife that he was going to New Orleans on business for the
                  Stage Office, and would probably be gone all winter. Unkind as he had grown, it
                  was hard parting. Gladly would she have taken all the risk of fatigue, to have
                  accompanied him with her babe but four months old, but he would listen to no such
                  proposal. When he did go, she felt sick at heart, and, as the thought flashed
                  across her mind that he might probably desert her, helpless and friendless as she
                  was, it seemed as if the fever of her mind would end in madness.</p>
               <p>Regularly, however, for several months, she heard from him, and each time he
                  enclosed her money; but little more than was sufficient to meet expenses. In the
                  last letter she received, he hinted that he might return home in a few weeks. At
                  the usual time of receiving a letter, she waited day after day, hoping and almost
                  fearing to receive one—anxious to hear from him, and yet fearing that he might
                  have changed his mind as to his contemplated return.</p>
               <p>Week after week passed, and there were no tidings. Day after day she went to the
                  post-office with an anxious heart, which throbbed quicker and quicker as the clerk
                  mechanically and carelessly turned over letter after letter, and at last
                  pronounced the word "none," with professional indifference. Then it would seem to
                  stop, and lie like a motionless weight in her bosom, and she would steal away
                  paler and sicker than when she came. At last, her distress of mind became so
                  great, that she went, reluctantly, to the stage-office, to inquire if they had
                  heard from him recently. To her hesitating, anxious inquiry, she received the
                  brief reply that they knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>"But is he not in the employment of this office?"</p>
               <p>"I hope not," was the short, sneering reply of one of the clerks.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, sir?" she asked, in an excited tone—"he is my husband."</p>
               <p>The manner of the man instantly changed. "Nothing, ma'am.—It was only a
                  thoughtless reply. He is not, however, in our employment, and never has been."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Warburton turned pale as ashes. A chair was instantly handed to her, and a
                  glass of water, and every kind attention offered.</p>
               <p>At this moment a man entered, who eyed Mrs. W. with a vulgar stare. The person who
                  had first spoken to Mrs. W. took him aside, and after conversing in whispers for a
                  few moments, turned to her and said that he had just learned that her husband had
                  joined a band of traders, and was now on his way to Mexico.</p>
               <p>"How do you know?" was the quick reply.</p>
               <p>"This gentleman has just told me."</p>
               <p>"And how do you know, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I received a letter from him three weeks ago, in which he stated the fact to me.
                  He has been in my employment<pb n="472-473" xml:id="VAC5627-00000237"/> ever since
                  he has been away, but has left it and gone to Mexico."</p>
               <p>"When did he say he would return?" she asked, in a calm voice.</p>
               <p>"That is uncertain, madam."</p>
               <p>She tottered out of the office, and stole home with an enfeebled step.
                  "Forsaken!—forsaken!"—was all the form her thoughts would take, until she met the
                  sweet face of her babe, and then her heart felt warmer, and not all forsaken.</p>
               <p>"Poor thing! how I pity her," said the clerk in the stage-office, when Mrs. W. had
                  retired. "Her husband is a scoundrel, that's all I know about it," responded the
                  gentleman-gambler, who had sent Warburton out on a swindling expedition.</p>
               <p>"The more the pity for his poor wife."</p>
               <p>"I wonder if she has any property of his in her hands?" queried the gambler.</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Why?—Why because I'll have my own out of it if she has. I have his note, payable
                  in a week, for money lent; and if he has got a dollar here, I'll have it."</p>
               <p>"You'll not turn his wife out of doors, will you?"</p>
               <p>"Will I?"—and his face grew dark with evil thoughts. —"Will I?—yes!—what care I
                  for the whining wench! I'll see her to-morrow, and know what we have both to
                  expect."</p>
               <p>"Coulson!" said the clerk, in an excited but firm voice—"You shall not trouble
                  that helpless, unfortunate woman!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Shall not?</emph> ha! Pray, Mr. Sympathy, and how can you hinder me?"</p>
               <p>"Look you to that, sir. I <emph>act</emph>, you know, not threaten."</p>
               <p>The gambler's face grew darker, but the clerk turned away with a look of contempt,
                  and resumed his employment.</p>
               <p>That night he sought the dwelling of Mrs. Warburton. He found her boarding at a
                  respectable house on —— street. He named his business at once, and warned her not
                  to allow herself to get in the power of Coulson, who was a gambler, and an
                  abandoned villain.</p>
               <p>When he understood her real situation—that she was in debt for board, and without
                  a dollar, forsaken of her husband band, and among strangers, his heart ached for
                  her. Himself but on the salary of a clerk, he could give little or no assistance.
                  But advice and sympathy he tendered, and requested her to call on him at any time,
                  if she thought that he could aid her. A kind word, a sympathising tone, is, to one
                  in such a sad condition, like gentle dews to the parched ground.</p>
               <p>"Above all," was his parting admonition, "beware of Coulson! He will injure your
                  character if he can. Do not see him. Forbid the servants to admit him. He will, if
                  he fixes his heart upon seeing you, leave no stone unturned to accomplish it. But
                  waver not in your determination. And be sure to let me know if he persecutes you
                  too closely. Be resolute, and fear not. I know the man, and have crossed his path
                  ere this. And he knows me."</p>
               <p>Early on the next day, Coulson called, and with the most insinuating address,
                  asked to see Mrs. Warburton.</p>
               <p>"Ask him to send up his name," was Mrs. W.'s reply to the information of the
                  servant, that a gentleman wished to speak to her.</p>
               <p>"Coulson," was returned.</p>
               <p>"Tell him that I cannot see him."</p>
               <p>To this answer he sent back word that his business was important and urgent.</p>
               <p>"Tell him that I cannot see him," was the firm reply.</p>
               <p>Coulson left the house, baffled for once. The next day he called, and sent up
                  another name.</p>
               <p>"He is the same person who called himself 'Coulson' yesterday," said the servant
                  to Mrs. W.</p>
               <p>"Tell him that I cannot be seen."</p>
               <p>"I'll match the huzzy yet!" he muttered to himself as he left the house.</p>
               <p>It now became necessary for Mrs. Warburton to rally all the energies of her
                  nature, feeble though they were, and yet untried. The rate of boarding which she
                  was required to pay, was much beyond what she could now afford. At first she
                  nearly gave up to despair. Thus far in life, she had never earned a single dollar,
                  and, from her earliest recollection, the thought of working for money seemed to
                  imply degradation. But necessity soon destroys false pride. Her greatest concern
                  now was, what she should do for a living. She had learned to play on the<pb
                     n="474-475" xml:id="VAC5627-00000238"/> piano, to draw and paint, and had
                  practised embroidery. But in all these she had sought only amusement. In not a
                  single one of them was she proficient enough to teach. Fine sewing she could not
                  do. Her dresses had all been made by the mantua-maker, and her fine sewing by the
                  family sempstress. She had been raised in idle pleasure— had spent her time in
                  thrumming on the piano, making calls, tripping about the streets, and entertaining
                  company.</p>
               <p>But wherever there is the will, there is a way. Through the kind interference of a
                  stranger, she was enabled to act decisively. Two rooms were procured, and after
                  selling various articles of costly chamber furniture which still remained, she was
                  enabled to furnish them plainly and comfortably, and have about fifty dollars
                  left. Through the kind advice of this same stranger, (where were all her former
                  friends?) employment was had, by which she was soon able to earn from four to five
                  dollars a week.</p>
               <p>Her employment was making cigars. At first, the tobacco made her so sick that she
                  was unable to hold her head up, or work more than half her time. But after awhile
                  she became used to it, and could work steadily all day; though she often suffered
                  with a distressing headache. Mrs. Warburton was perhaps the first woman who made
                  cigars in ———. Through the application of a third person, to a manufacturer, the
                  work was obtained, and given, from motives of charity.</p>
               <p>She had been thus employed for about three months, and was beginning to work
                  skilfully enough to earn four dollars a week, and give all necessary attention to
                  herself and child, when Mr. ——, the manufacturer, received a note signed by all
                  the journeymen in his shop, demanding of him the withdrawal of all work from Mrs.
                  Warburton, on pain of their refusal to work a day longer. It was an infringement,
                  they said, upon their rights. Women could afford to work cheaper than men, and
                  would ruin the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. —— was well off, and, withal, a man who could brook no dictation, in his
                  business. His journeymen were paid their regular wages, and had, he knew, no right
                  to say whom he should employ; and for any such interference he promptly resolved
                  to teach them a lesson. He was, moreover, indignant that a parcel of men, many of
                  whom spent more money at the taverns and in foolish expenses, in the week, than
                  the poor forsaken mother of a young babe could earn in that time, should
                  heartlessly endeavour to rob the more than widow of her hard-earned mite.</p>
               <p>"I will sacrifice half that I am worth, before I will yield to such dictation,"
                  was his only answer to the demand. The foolish men "struck," and turned out to
                  lounge idly in taverns and other places, until their employer should come to
                  terms. They were, however, soon convinced of their folly; for but a few weeks
                  elapsed before Mr. had employed females to make his cigars, who could afford to
                  work for one-third less than the journeymen had been receiving, and make good
                  wages at that. The consequence was, that the men who had, from motives of
                  selfishness, endeavoured to deprive Mrs. W. of her only chance of support, were
                  unable to obtain work at any price. Several of them fell into idle and dissolute
                  habits, and became vagabonds. Other manufacturers of cigars followed the example
                  of Mr. ——, and lessened the demand for journeymen; and the result in this instance
                  was but a similar one to that which always follows combinations against
                  employers—viz: to injure the interests of journeymen.</p>
               <p>It was not long before Coulson found out the retreat of Mrs. Warburton, and
                  commenced his persecutions. The note of her husband had fallen due, and his first
                  movement was to demand the payment. Perceiving, however, at once, that to make the
                  money out of any property in her possession was impossible, he changed his manner,
                  and offered to befriend her in any way that lay in his power. For a moment she was
                  thrown off her guard; but remembering the caution she had received, she assumed a
                  manner of the most rigid coldness towards him, and told him that she already had
                  friends who would care for her. The next day she managed to apprize the clerk in
                  the Stage Office of the visit of Coulson, who promptly took measures to alarm his
                  fears, for he was a coward at heart, and effectually prevent his again troubling
                  her.</p>
               <p>Little of an interesting nature occurred for about a year, when she received a
                  letter from her husband at Cincinnati. He stated that having despaired of getting
                     along<pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC5627-00000239"/> in the business he had entered
                  into on leaving— which had involved him in debt, he had left with a company of
                  traders for Mexico, and had just returned with a little money, with which he
                  wished to go into business. But that if he returned to—, he would be troubled, and
                  all he had taken from him. He enclosed her a hundred dollar note, and wished her
                  to come to him immediately, and to leave—without letting any one know her
                  destination. He professed much sorrow for having left her in so destitute a
                  condition, but pleaded stern necessity for the act.</p>
               <p>Mrs. W. did not hesitate a moment. In four days from the time she received the
                  letter, she was on the way to Cincinnati. Arrived there, she was met by her
                  husband with some show of affection. He was greatly changed since she had seen
                  him, and showed many indications of irregular habits. He appeared to have plenty
                  of money, and took rooms for his wife in a respectable boardinghouse. The
                  improvement in his child pleased him much. When he went away it was only about
                  five months old—now it was a bright little boy, and could run about and chatter
                  like a bird. After some hesitation in regard to the kind of business he should
                  select, he at last determined to go into the river-trade. To this Mrs. Warburton
                  gently objected; because it would keep him away from home for months together. But
                  his capital was small, and he at length made his first purchase of produce, and
                  started in a flat-boat for New Orleans. Poor Mrs. W. felt as if deserted again
                  when he left her. But at the end of three months he returned, having cleared four
                  hundred dollars by the trip. He remained at home this time for two months,
                  drinking and gambling; and at the expiration of that period had barely enough left
                  to make a small purchase and start again.</p>
               <p>Her troubles, she plainly saw, were just beginning again, and Mrs. Warburton
                  almost wished herself back again in the city, for which, though there she had no
                  friends, her heart yearned.</p>
               <p>Her husband did not return, this time, from his river-voyage, for three months;
                  nor did he send his wife during that time any money. The amount left her was
                  entirely exhausted before the end of the second month, and having heard nothing of
                  him since he went away, she feared to get in debt, and, therefore, two weeks
                  before her money was out, applied for work at a cigar-factory. Here she was
                  fortunate enough to obtain employment, and thus keep herself above absolute
                  want.</p>
               <p>Long before her husband returned, her heart had fearful forebodings of a second
                  blighting of all its dearest hopes. Not the less painful, were those
                  anticipations, because she had once suffered.</p>
               <p>One evening in June, just three months from the time her husband left, she had
                  paused from her almost unremitted employment, during the violence of a tremendous
                  storm, that was raging without. The thunder rattled around in startling peals, and
                  the lightning blazed from cloud to cloud, without a moment's intermission. She
                  could not work while she felt that the bolt of death hung over her. For half an
                  hour had the storm raged, when in one of the pauses which indicated its passing
                  away, she started at the sound of a voice that seemed like that of her husband. In
                  the next moment another voice mingled with it, and both were loud and angry.
                  Fearfully she flung open the door, and just on the pavement, drenched with the
                  rain, and unregardful of the storm, for one more terrible raged within, stood two
                  men, contending with each other in mortal strife, while horrible oaths and
                  imprecations rolled from their lips. One of these, from his distorted face,
                  rendered momently visible in the vivid flashes of the lightning, and from his
                  voice, though loud and disguised by passion, she at once knew to be her husband.
                  His antagonist was not so strong a man, but he was more active, and seemed much
                  cooler. Each had in his hand an open Spanish knife, and both were striking,
                  plunging, and parrying thrusts with the most malignant fury. It was an awful sight
                  to look upon. Two human beings striving for each other's lives amid the fury of a
                  terrible storm, the lightnings of which glanced sharply upon their glittering
                  knives, revealing their fiend-like countenances for an instant, and then leaving
                  them in black darkness.</p>
               <p>For a few moments, Mrs. Warburton stood fixed to the spot, but, recalling her
                  scattered senses, she rushed towards the combatants, calling upon them to pause,
                  and repeating<pb n="478-479" xml:id="VAC5627-00000240"/> the name of her husband
                  in a voice of agony. The result of the strife was delayed but an instant longer,
                  for with a loud cry her husband fell bleeding at her feet. His antagonist passed
                  out of sight in a moment.</p>
               <p>Lifting the apparently lifeless form of her husband in her arms, Mrs. Warburton
                  carried or rather dragged him into the house, and placed him upon the bed, where
                  lay their sleeping boy. She then hurried off for the nearest physician, who was
                  soon in attendance.</p>
               <p>The first sound that met the ear of Mrs. Warburton, on her return, was the voice
                  of her dear child, eagerly calling, "Pa! pa! wake up, pa!"—And there was the
                  little fellow pulling at the insensible body of his father, in an <choice>
                     <sic>extacy</sic>
                     <corr>ecstasy</corr>
                  </choice> of infantile joy at his return.</p>
               <p>"Pa come home!—Pa come home, mamma!" And the little fellow clapped his hands, and
                  shook the body of his father in the effort to wake him.</p>
               <p>The mother gently lifted her child from the bed. His little face instantly changed
                  its expression into one of fear, when he looked into his mother's countenance.
                  "Pa's very sick, and little Charles must keep still," she whispered to the child,
                  and sat him down in the next room.</p>
               <p>When the physician arrived, he found that the knife had entered the left breast
                  just above the heart, but had not penetrated far enough to destroy life. There
                  were also several bad cuts, in different parts of his body, all of which required
                  attention. After dressing them, he left the still insensible man in the care of
                  his wife and one of his assistants, with directions to have him called should any
                  alarming symptom occur. It was not until the next morning that there was any
                  apparent return of consciousness on the part of the wounded man. Then he asked in
                  a feeble voice for his wife. She had left the bed but a moment before, and hearing
                  him speak, was by his side in an instant.</p>
               <p>"Julia, how came I here? What is the matter?" said he, rousing up, and looking
                  anxiously around. But overcome with weakness from the loss of blood, he sank back
                  upon the bed, and remained apparently insensible for some time. But he soon showed
                  evidence of painful recollection having returned. For his breathing became more
                  laboured, under agitated feelings, and he glanced his eyes about the room with an
                  eager expression. After a few minutes he buried his face in the bed-clothes and
                  sighed heavily. Distinct, painful consciousness had returned.</p>
               <p>In a few days he began to grow stronger, and was able to sit up; and with the
                  return of bodily vigour came back the deadly passions that had agitated him on the
                  night of his return home. The man, he said, had literally robbed him of his money,
                  (in fact, won it); had cheated him out of every dollar of his hard-earned gains,
                  and he would have his life.</p>
               <p>When hardly well enough to walk about, Warburton felt the evil influence of his
                  desire for revenge so strong, as to cause him to seek out the individual who, he
                  conceived, had wronged him, by winning from him, or cheating him out of his money.
                  They met in one of the vile places in Cincinnati, where vice loves to do her dark
                  work in secret. Truly are they called hells, for there the love of evil and hatred
                  of the neighbour prompt to action. Every malignant passion in the heart of
                  Warburton was roused into full vigour, when his eyes fell upon the face of his
                  former associate. Instantly he grasped his knife, and with a yell of fiendish
                  exultation sprang towards him, like some savage beast eager for his prey. The
                  other gambler was a cool man, and hard to throw off of his guard. His first
                  movement was to knock Warburton down, then drawing his Spanish knife, he waited
                  calmly and firmly for his enemy to rise. Blind with passion, Warburton sprang to
                  his feet and rushed upon the other, who received him upon the point of his knife,
                  which entered deep into the abdomen. At the same instant, Warburton's knife was
                  plunged into the heart of his adversary, who staggered off from its point, reeled
                  for a few seconds about the room, and then fell heavily upon the floor. He was
                  dead before the cool spectators of the horrid scene could raise him up.</p>
               <p>From loss of blood Warburton soon fainted, and when he came to himself, he found
                  that he had been conveyed to his home, and that his weeping wife stood over him.
                  There were also others in the room, and he soon learned that he was to be
                  conveyed, even in the condition he was then in, to prison, to await his trial for
                  murder.</p>
               <p>In vain did his poor heart-stricken wife plead that he<pb n="480-481"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000241"/> might be left there until he recovered, or even
                  until his wound was dressed; but she pleaded in vain. On a litter, faint from loss
                  of blood, and groaning with pain, he was carried off to prison. By his side walked
                  her whom no ill treatment or neglect could estrange.</p>
               <p>Three months he was kept in jail, attended daily by his uncomplaining wife, who
                  supported herself and little boy, with her own hands, sparing much for her
                  husband's comfort. The wound had not proved very dangerous, and long before his
                  trial came on, he was as well as ever.</p>
               <p>The day of trial at length came, and Mrs. Warburton found that it required her
                  strongest efforts to keep sufficiently composed to comprehend the true nature and
                  bearing of all the legal proceedings. Never in her life before had she been in a
                  court of justice, and the bare idea of being in that, to her awful, place, stunned
                  at first all her perceptions; especially as she was there under circumstances of
                  such deep and peculiar interest.</p>
               <p>Next to her husband, in the bar, did this suffering woman take her place: and that
                  husband arraigned before. his country's tribunal for the highest crime—murder! How
                  little did she dream of such an awful situation, years before, when a gay,
                  thoughtless, innocent girl, she gave up in maiden confidence, and with deep joy,
                  her affections to that husband. Passing on step by step, in misery's paths, she
                  had at last reached a point, the bare idea of which, had it been entertained as
                  possible for a moment, would have almost extinguished life. Now, her deep interest
                  in that husband who had abused her confidence, and almost extinguished hope in her
                  bosom, kept her up, and enabled her to watch with unwavering attention every
                  minute proceeding.</p>
               <p>After the indictment was read, and the State's Attorney, in a comprehensive
                  manner, had stated the distinct features of the case, which he pledged himself to
                  prove by competent witnesses, poor Mrs. Warburton became sick and faint. A clearer
                  case of deliberate murder could not, it seemed to her, be made out. Still, she was
                  sure there must be palliating circumstances, and longed to be permitted to rise
                  and state her impressions of the case. Once she did start to her feet, but a right
                  consciousness returned before she had uttered a word. Shrinking into her seat
                  again, she watched with a pale face and eager look, the course of the
                  proceedings.</p>
               <p>Witness after witness was called on the part of the state, each testifying
                  distinctly the fact of Warburton's attack upon the murdered man, and his threat to
                  take his life. Hope seemed utterly to fail from the heart of the poor wife, when
                  the testimony on the part of the prosecution closed. But now came the time for the
                  examination of witnesses in favour of the prisoner. Soon Mrs. Warburton was seen
                  upon her feet, bending over towards the witness' stand, and eagerly devouring each
                  word. Rapid changes would pass over her countenance, as she comprehended, with a
                  woman's quickness of perception, rendered acute by strong interest, the bearing
                  which the evidence would have upon the case. Now her eye would flash with interest
                  and her face become flushed—and now her cheek would pale, and her form seem to
                  shrink into half its dimensions. Oh! who can imagine one thousandth part of all
                  her sufferings on that awful occasion? When, finally, the case was given to the
                  jury, and after waiting hour after hour at the court-house, to hear the decision,
                  she had to go home long after dark, in despair of knowing the result before
                  morning, it seemed hardly possible that she could pass through that night and
                  retain her senses. She did not sleep through the night's long watches—how could
                  she sleep? Hours before the court assembled, she was at the court-house, waiting
                  to know the fate of one, who now, in his fearful extremity, seemed dearer to her
                  than ever. Slowly passed the lingering minutes, and at length ten o'clock came.
                  The court-room was filled to suffocation, but through the dense crowd she made her
                  way, and took her place beside her anxious husband. The court opened, and the
                  foreman of the jury came forward to read the verdict. Many an eye sought with
                  eager curiosity, or strong interest, the face of the wife. Its calmness was
                  strange and awful. All anxiety, all deep interest had left it, and as she turned
                  her eye upon the foreman, none could read the slightest exhibition of emotion.
                  "GUILTY OF MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE!" Quick as thought a hundred eyes again
                  sought the face of Mrs. Warburton. It was pale as ashes, and her insensible
                     form<pb n="482-483" xml:id="VAC5627-00000242"/> was gently reclining upon the
                  arm of her husband, which had been extended to save her from falling.</p>
               <p>When recollection returned, she was lying upon her own bed, in her own chamber,
                  with her little boy crying by her side. Those who had, from humane feelings,
                  conveyed her home, suffered the dictates of humanity to die in their bosoms ere
                  her consciousness returned; and thus she was left, insensible, with no companion
                  but her child.</p>
               <p>In due course, Warburton was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, the first
                  three years to be passed in solitary confinement. During the first term, no person
                  was to be allowed to visit him. The knowledge of such a sentence was a dreadful
                  blow to Mrs. Warburton. She parted from him in the court-room, on the day of his
                  sentence, and for three long, weary years, her eyes saw him not again.</p>
               <p>But a short time after the imprisonment of Warburton, another babe came into the
                  world to share the misery of her whose happiness he had, in all his actions, so
                  little regarded. When able again to go about, and count up her store, Mrs.
                  Warburton found that she had little left her beyond a willing heart to labour for
                  her children. It would have been some comfort to her if she had been permitted to
                  visit her husband, but this the law forbade.</p>
               <p>"Despair is never quite despair," and once more in her life did Mrs. Warburton
                  prove this. The certainty that there could be no further dependence upon her
                  husband, led her to repose more confidently in her own resources, for a living,
                  and they did not fail her. She had long since found out that our necessities cost
                  much less than our superfluities, and therefore she did not sit down in idle
                  despondency. Early in the morning and late at night was she found diligently
                  employed, and though her compensation was not great, it was enough to supply her
                  real wants.</p>
               <p>For two years had she supported thus with her own hands herself and children. The
                  oldest was now a smart little fellow of five years, and the youngest a fair-haired
                  girl of some two summers. Thus far had she kept them around her; but sickness at
                  last came. Nature could not always sustain the heavy demands made upon her, and at
                  last sunk under them.</p>
               <p>There are many more cases of extreme suffering in this country than persons are
                  generally willing to believe. These extreme cases are among those whose peculiar
                  feelings will not allow of their making known their real condition. They are such
                  as were once members of some social circle, far removed indeed from the apparent
                  chances of poverty. Their shrinking pride, their yearning desire for independence
                  clings closer and closer to them, and operates more and more powerfully, as they
                  sink lower and lower, from uncontrollable causes, into the vale of want and
                  destitution. Beggars with no feelings, and no claims beyond those of idleness and
                  intemperance, thrust themselves forward, and consume the bread of charity, that
                  should go to nourish the widow and the orphan, who suffer daily and nightly,
                  rather than ask for aid.</p>
               <p>One to whom the idea of eating the bread of charity had ever been a painful and
                  revolting one, was Mrs. Warburton. So long as she was able, she had earned with
                  untiring industry, the food that nourished her children. But close confinement,
                  insufficient nourishment, labour beyond her strength, and above all, a wounded
                  spirit, at last completed the undermining work, which threw down the tottering and
                  feeble health that had long kept her at her duties.</p>
               <p>It was mid-winter when she was severely attacked by a bilious-pleurisy. For some
                  weeks she had drooped about, hardly able to perform half her wonted labour—most of
                  that time suffering from a hard cough and distressing pain in the side, which was
                  augmented almost to agony while bending steadily, and for hours over her work.
                  Taking, as it did, all that she could earn to keep herself and children in comfort
                  during the winter, she had nothing laid up for a time of more pressing need; and,
                  as for the last few weeks, she had earned so little as to have barely enough for
                  necessaries, when helplessness came, she was in utter destitution, Her wood was
                  just out, except a few hard, knotted logs; her flour was out, and her money gone.
                  When she could no longer sit up, she sent her little boy for a physician, who bled
                  her, and left her some powerful medicines. The first gave temporary relief, and
                  the latter reduced her to a state of great bodily and mental weakness. He did not
                  call in again until the<pb n="484-485" xml:id="VAC5627-00000243"/> second day,
                  when he found the children both in bed with their mother, who was suffering
                  greatly from a return of the pain in her side. The room was chilly, for there was
                  no fire, and it was intensely cold without, and the ground covered with a deep
                  snow. He again bled her, which produced immediate relief, and learning that she
                  had no wood, called in at the next door, where lived a wealthy family, and stated
                  the condition of their poor neighbour A child of six years old stood by his mother
                  while the physician was speaking. The lady seemed much affected when told of the
                  sufferings of the, poor woman, politely thanked the physician for making her
                  acquainted with the fact, and promised immediate attention.</p>
               <p>That evening there was to be at this house a large party. Extra servants had been
                  employed that day, and all was bustle and preparation.</p>
               <p>"Sarah," called the lady, a few minutes after, to her housekeeper—"Sarah, Dr. H——
                  was here just now, and said that the poor woman who lives next door is sick and
                  out of fuel. Tell John to take her in an armful of wood, and do you just step in
                  and see what more she is in want of."</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am," responds Sarah, and muttering to herself some dissatisfaction at the
                  order, descends to the kitchen, and addresses a sable man-servant, and kind of
                  doer-of-all-work-in-general, in doors and out,</p>
               <p>"John, Mrs. —— says you must take an armful of wood in to Mrs. Warrington; I
                  believe that is the woman's name who lives next door."</p>
               <p>"Who? de woman whose husband in de <choice>

                  </choice>?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that's the one, John."</p>
               <p>"Don't love to meddle wid dem guess sort of folks, Miss Sarah. 'Druder not be
                  gwine in dere," responds the black, with a broad grin at his own humour.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't care whether you do or not," responds Sarah, and glides swiftly
                  away, satisfied to do one part of her order and forget the other, which related to
                  her going in to see the poor woman herself. Mrs. —— shifted off the duty on her
                  housekeeper, and she contented herself by forgetting it.</p>
               <p>Little William, who was present with his mother when the doctor called, was, like
                  all children, a true republican, and had often played with the child of the sick
                  woman. He had seen his little playmate but a few times since the cold weather set
                  in; but had all his sympathies aroused, at the doctor's recital. Being rather more
                  suspicious of the housekeeper than his mother, and no doubt for good reasons best
                  known to himself, he followed on to the kitchen, and was an ear-witness to what
                  passed between John and the sub-mistress of the mansion.</p>
               <p>"Come, John, now that's a good fellow," said he to the negro, after the
                  housekeeper had retired, "take in some wood to poor Mrs. Warburton."</p>
               <p>"'Fraid, Massa Billy, 'deed. 'Fraid of <choice>
                     <sic>penetentiary</sic>
                     <corr>penitentiary</corr>
                  </choice>—ha! ha!! ha!!!"</p>
               <p>"She can't help that, though, John. So come along, and take the wood in."</p>
               <p>"'Fraid, i'deed, Massa Billy."</p>
               <p>"Well, if you don't, I'll take it in myself, and dirty all my clothes, and then
                  somebody will find it out, without my turning tell-tale."</p>
               <p>John grinned a broad smile, and forthwith, finding himself outwitted, carried in
                  the wood, and left it in the middle of the floor, without saying a word.</p>
               <p>Towards evening, just before the company assembled, little William, not at all
                  disposed to forget, as every one else had done, the poor sufferers next door, went
                  to the housekeeper's room, where she was busy as a bee with preparations for the
                  party, and stationed himself in the door, accosted her with—</p>
               <p>"Miss Sarah, have you been in to see Mrs. Warburton, as ma told you, to-day?"</p>
               <p>"That's no concern of yours, Mr. Inquisitive."</p>
               <p>"But I'd just like to know, Miss Sarah; 'cause I'm going in myself, if you hav'nt
                  been."</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose that I have not paid attention to what your ma said? I know my own
                  business, without instruction from you."</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't believe you've been in, so I don't, that's all; and if you don't
                  say yes or no at once, why, you see, I'll go right in myself."</p>
               <p>"Well (coaxingly) never mind, Billy, I haint been in, I've been so busy; but just
                  wait a little bit, and I'll go There's no use of your going; you can't do
                  nothing."</p>
               <pb n="486-487" xml:id="VAC5627-00000244"/>
               <p>"I know that, Miss Sarah, and that's why I want you to go in. But if you don't go
                  in, I will, so there, now!"</p>
               <p>"Well, just wait a little bit, and I'll go."</p>
               <p>The child, but half satisfied, slowly went away, but lingered about the passages
                  to watch the housekeeper. Night, however, came on, and he had not seen her going.
                  All were now busy lighting up, and making the more immediate and active
                  preparations for the reception of company, when he met her in the hall, and to
                  his, "Look here, I say, Miss Sarah," she hurried past him unheeding.</p>
               <p>The company at last assembled, and the hours had passed away until it was nine
                  o'clock. Without, all was cold, bleak, and cheerless. Within, there was the
                  perfection of comfort.</p>
               <p>Little William had been absent for some time, but no one missed him. Just as a
                  large company were engaged in the various ways of passing time, dancing, chatting,
                  and partaking of refreshments, the room door opened, and in came Master Billy,
                  dragging in by the hand, a little barefoot fellow about his own age, with nothing
                  on but a clean, well-patched shirt, and a pair of linen trowsers. Without heeding
                  the company, he pulled him up to the glowing grate, and in the fulness of his
                  young benevolent heart, cried out,</p>
               <p>"Here's fire, Charley! Warm yourself, old fellow! Hurrah! I guess I've fixed Miss
                  Sarah now." And the little fellow clapped his hands as innocently and as
                  gracefully, as if there had been no one in the room but himself and Charley.</p>
               <p>All was agreeable and curious confusion in a few minutes, and scores crowded
                  around the poor child with a lively interest, who, an hour before would have
                  passed him in the street unnoticed.</p>
               <p>"Why, Willy! what does all this mean?" exclaimed the father, after something like
                  order had been restored.</p>
               <p>"Why, pa, you see, this is Charley Warburton," began the little fellow, holding
                  the astonished Charley by the hand, and presenting him quite ceremoniously to his
                  father. "Doctor H—— came here to-day, and told ma that his mother was sick next
                  door, and that they had no wood. So ma tells Sarah to send John in with some wood,
                  and to go in herself and see if they wanted anything. So Sarah goes and tells John
                  to go and take some wood in. But John he wa'nt going to go, till I told him that
                  if he didn't go I would, and if I went to carrying in wood, I'd dirty all my
                  clothes, and then somebody would want to know the reason. So John he carried in
                  some wood. Then I watched Sarah, but she didn't go in. So I told her about it. And
                  then she promised, but didn't go. I told her again, and she promised, but didn't
                  go. I waited and waited until night, and still Sarah didn't go in. Then you see,
                  awhile ago I slipped out the front door, and tried to go in to Mrs. Warburton's.
                  But it was all so dark there, that I couldn't see anybody; and when I called
                  'Charley,' here, his mother said, softly, 'who's there,' and I said 'it's only
                  little Willy. Ma wants to know if you don't want nothing.' 'Oh, it's little
                  Willy—it's little Willy!' says Charley, and he jumps on the floor, and then we
                  both came in here. O! it's so dark and cold in there—do pa go in, and make John
                  build them a fire."</p>
               <p>During the child's innocent but feeling recital, more than one eye filled with
                  tears. Mrs. —— hung down her head for a moment, in silent upbraidings of heart,
                  for having consigned a work of charity to neglectful and unfeeling servants. Then
                  taking her child in her arms, she hugged him to her bosom, and said,</p>
               <p>"Bless you, bless you, my boy! That innocent heart has taught your mother a lesson
                  she will not soon forget." The father felt prouder of his son than he had ever
                  felt, and there were few present who did not almost wish him their own. Little
                  Charley was asked by Mr. —— if he was hungry, on observing him wistfully eyeing a
                  piece of cake.</p>
               <p>"We haint had nothin' to eat all day, sir, none of us."</p>
               <p>"And why not, my little man?" asked Mr. —— in a voice of assumed calmness.</p>
               <p>"'Cause, sir, we haint got nothin' to eat in the house. Mother always had good
                  things for us till she got sick, and now we are all hungry, and haint got nothin'
                  to eat."</p>
               <p>"Here, Sarah, (to the housekeeper, who came in at the moment)—no, not you,
                  either—do you, Emma, (to his wife,) give this hungry child some nourishing food
                  with your own hands. He has a claim on you, for the sake of our little Willy."</p>
               <pb n="488-489" xml:id="VAC5627-00000245"/>
               <p>Mrs. —— was not slow in relieving Charley's wants and then, after excusing herself
                  to the company, she visited, with John and Sarah, the humble, uncomplaining child
                  of humanity, who had been suffering, so painfully, in the next house to her
                  comfortable dwelling.</p>
               <p>The light carried by John revealed, in the middle of the floor, the armful of
                  wood, in large logs, almost impossible to kindle, which the servant had thrown
                  down there without a word, or an offer to make a fire. Mrs. ——'s heart smote her
                  when she saw this evidence of her neglect of true charity. Enveloped in the
                  bed-clothes, she found Mrs. Warburton and her little child, the former suffering
                  from pain and fever, and the latter asleep, with tears glistening on her
                  eyelashes. The room was so cold that it sent chills all over her, as she had come
                  in without throwing a shawl around her shoulders.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to find you so sick, and everything around you so cold and
                  comfortless," she said, addressing Mrs. Warburton.</p>
               <p>"I don't feel so very sick, ma'am, only when I try to sit up, I grow so faint, and
                  have to lie down again. If my little things had anything to eat, I wouldn't mind
                  it much."</p>
               <p>Just then, aroused by the voice of her mother, the little girl awoke, and began
                  moaning and crying. She could not speak plain, and her "bed and mik, mamma"—"O,
                  mamma, bed and mik," thrilled every heart-string of Mrs. ——, who had never before
                  in her life witnessed the keen distress of a mother while her child asked in vain
                  for bread. She drew the child out of bed, and kissing it, handed it to Sarah,
                  whose feelings were also touched, and told her to take the little thing into her
                  house, and give it to the nurse, with directions to feed it, and then come
                  back.</p>
               <p>By this time, John, rather more active than usual, had kindled a fire, the genial
                  warmth of which began already to soften the keen air of the room. Some warm drinks
                  were prepared for Mrs. Warburton; and Mrs. —— had the satisfaction to see her, in
                  the course of half an hour, sink away into a sweet and refreshing slumber. On
                  glancing around the room, she was gratified, and somewhat surprised, to see
                  everything, though plain and scanty, exhibiting the utmost order and cleanliness.
                  The uncarpeted floor was spotless, and the single pine table as white as hands
                  could make it. "How much am I to blame," was her inward thought, "for having so
                  neglected this poor woman in her distress and in her poverty!"</p>
               <p>On returning to her company, and giving a history of the scene she had just
                  witnessed, the general feeling of sympathy prompted immediate measures for relief,
                  and a very handsome sum was placed in the hands of Mrs. ——, by the gentlemen and
                  ladies present, for the use of Mrs. Warburton. Rarely does a social company retire
                  with each individual of it so satisfied in heart as did the company assembled at
                  Mrs. ——'s, on that evening. Truly could they say, "It is more blessed to give than
                  to receive."</p>
               <p>The incident just related, possessing a kind of romantic interest, soon became
                  noised about from family to family, and for awhile it was fashionable to minister
                  to the wants of Mrs. Warburton—whose health continued very delicate—and to her
                  young family. But a few months passed away, and then one after another ceased to
                  remember or care for her. Even Mrs. ——, the mother of little Billy, began to grow
                  weary of charity long continued, and to feel that it was a burdensome task to be
                  every day or two obliged to call in or inquire after the poor invalid. Finally,
                  she dismissed the subject from her mind, and left Mrs. Warburton to the tender
                  mercies of Sarah, the housekeeper.</p>
               <p>From a state of deep despondence to one of hope, had Mrs. Warburton been raised,
                  by the timely aid afforded through the persevering interference of the little
                  playmate of her son. But she soon began to perceive, after a time, that the
                  charity was only spasmodic, and entered into without a real consideration of her
                  peculiar case. The money given her was the best assistance that could have been
                  rendered, for with this she obtained a supply of wood, flour, meal, potatoes, and
                  some warm clothing for her little ones. But this would not last always, and the
                  multitude of little nice things sent from this one and that, were of but little
                  service.</p>
               <p>The month of March, so trying to a weak and shattered constitution, found her just
                  well enough to venture out to<pb n="490-491" xml:id="VAC5627-00000246"/> seek for
                  employment at her old business of cigar-making. She readily obtained work, and
                  again sat down to earn for herself and children, the bread that should nourish
                  them. But she was soon made to feel keenly that her health was not as it had been.
                  A severe pain in the side was her daily companion, and she had to toil on, often
                  sick and faint, from daylight until long after others had sought the grateful
                  repose of their pillows. Painfully alive to a sense of dependence, she was ready
                  at any time to work beyond her strength rather than to eat the bread of charity.
                  This kept her steadily bending over her work until nature again became exhausted,
                  and she was forced, from direct debility, to suspend her labours for at least the
                  half of every day. As April came in, with an occasional warm day, her appetite
                  gradually left her, and she began to experience a loathing of food. Weakness,
                  headaches, and other painful warnings of nature, were the consequences. Her
                  earnings were now so small, that she with difficulty procured enough of food for
                  her children. She knew that if she would let Mrs. —— know her pressing
                  destitution, food and other necessaries would be supplied; but she shrank from
                  telling her wants. Finding, however, that her strength continued to fail, until
                  she was unable to sit up but for a few hours at a time, and that, in consequence
                  of her extreme weakness, the nausea produced by the tobacco was so great, as to
                  render it almost impossible for her to work in it, she made up her mind to let her
                  boy go in to Mrs. ——, with a request to send her some little thing that she could
                  eat, in hopes that something from her table might provoke an appetite.</p>
               <p>Mrs. —— was sitting at her dinner-table, which was covered with the luxuries of
                  the season, when little Charley came into the room and handed in his poor mother's
                  request.</p>
               <p>"Please, ma'am, mother says will you be so good as to send her some little thing
                  that she could eat. She has no appetite, and not eatin' makes her so weak."</p>
               <p>"Here's some pie, Charley," struck in little Billy. "It's good, I tell you! Eat it
                  now; and ma, do send in Charley's mother a piece, too: I know she'll like it."</p>
               <p>But Billy and his mother did not agree in this. The latter thought a little sago
                  would be much better. So she gave Charley a paper in which were a few spoonfuls of
                  sago.</p>
               <p>"Here is some sago, mother," said Charley, on his return, "Mrs. —— says it will do
                  you good."</p>
               <p>Now it so happened that, from a child, she had never liked sago. There was
                  something in it so insipid to her, that she had never felt an inclination to more
                  than taste it. Particularly now did her stomach loathe it. But, even if she had
                  felt an inclination to taste the sago, she had not, at the time, any way to
                  prepare it so as to make it palatable. She did not, however, at the time, send for
                  anything else. She still had some flour and potatoes, and a little change to buy
                  milk, and on these her children fared very well. Healthy food does not cost a
                  great deal in this country, and Mrs. Warburton had long before learned to husband
                  well her resources.</p>
               <p>On the next morning she tried to get up, but fainted away on the floor. Her
                  children were still asleep, and were not even awakened by her fall. It was some
                  time before she recovered sufficiently to crawl upon the bed; and there she lay;
                  almost incapable of thought or motion, for hours. As feeble nature reacted again,
                  and she was able to think over her situation, she made up her mind to send in her
                  little boy again to Mrs. ——, with an apology for not using the sago, and request
                  her to give her some little thing from her table—anything at all that would be
                  likely, as she said, "to put a taste in her mouth," and induce an appetite for
                  food. The child delivered the message in the best way he knew how, but some how or
                  other it offended the ear of Mrs. ——, who had begun to be tired of what she was
                  pleased to call the importunities of Mrs. Warburton; though, in fact, she had
                  never before even hinted that she was in want of anything. The truth was, Sarah,
                  the housekeeper, had heard something from somebody, about Mrs. Warburton, and had
                  been relating the puerile scandal to Mrs. ——, who, instead of opposing the
                  tattling propensity in her servant, encouraged it, by lending to her silly stories
                  an attentive ear. But the story was false, from beginning to end, as are nearly
                  all the idle rumours which are constantly circulating from one family to another,
                  through the medium of servants.</p>
               <p>"How did she do," she had just been saying to Sarah,<pb n="492-493"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000247"/> "before I befriended her? It is a downright
                  imposition upon my good-nature, and I have no notion of encouraging idleness."</p>
               <p>"The fact is, ma'am," chimed in the maid, "these here poor people, when you once
                  help 'em, think you must be a'ways at it; they find it so much easier to beg than
                  work."</p>
               <p>Just at this stage of conversation, the child timidly preferred the humble and
                  moderate request of his sick mother; a request that should have thrilled the heart
                  of any one possessing a single human sympathy. But it came at the wrong moment.
                  The evil of self-love was active in the heart of Mrs. ——, and all love of the
                  neighbour was for the time extinguished. She cast upon the child a look so
                  forbidding that the little fellow turned involuntarily to go.</p>
               <p>"Here, Sarah," said she, in a half-angry tone, "send Mrs. Warburton a dried
                  herring. Perhaps that will 'put a taste in her mouth.'"</p>
               <p>And a herring was sent!</p>
               <p>"It's a pretty pass, indeed," said Miss Sarah, as the child closed the door, "when
                  beggars become choosers!"</p>
               <p>Only half satisfied with herself, Mrs. —— turned away and made no reply. How
                  differently did she feel on the night, when, with her own hands, she ministered to
                  the wants of this same suffering child of humanity! Then her heart, though melted
                  even to tears, felt a bounding gladness, from the consciousness of having relieved
                  the suffering. Now it was heavy and sad in her bosom, and she could not hush the
                  whispers of an accusing conscience.</p>
               <p>Little Charley carried home the herring, and laid it on the bed before his sick
                  mother. His own little heart was full, for he could not mistake the manner of Mrs.
                  —— for kindness. Mrs. Warburton looked at the uninviting food, and turned her head
                  away. After awhile, it did seem to her as if the fish would taste good to her, and
                  she raised herself up with an effort, and breaking off a small piece, put it
                  languidly to her lips. The morsel thrilled upon the nerve of taste, and she ate
                  the greater part of it with a relish she had not known for many weeks.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the heart of Mrs. —— smote her so severely, when all at once she
                  remembered having lost her appetite after a spell of sickness, and the difficulty
                  with which she regained it;—how during the day, nothing could tempt her to eat,
                  while all night long she would dream of rich banquets, of which she eagerly
                  desired to partake, but which changed to tasteless morsels, when she lifted the
                  inviting food to her lips. For a time she strove against her feelings, but at last
                  gave up, and ringing for the cook, directed her to broil a couple of thin slices
                  of ham very nicely, make a good cup of tea, and a slice or two of toast. When this
                  was ready, it was sent in to Mrs. Warburton. It came just in time, and met the
                  excited appetite of the faint-hearted invalid. It was like manna in the
                  wilderness, and revived and refreshed her drooping frame.</p>
               <p>From this time she gradually regained her appetite and strength; and had the
                  gratification of being able to earn with her own hands enough for the support of
                  her children.</p>
               <p>This she continued to do until the expiration of the solitary confinement term of
                  her husband. How wearily passed the long, long days and nights, as the time
                  approached for her again to look upon the face that had been hid from her sight
                  for three sorrowful years! The long absence had only excited her affection for
                  him. Not as the dead had she thought of him, but as of the living, and of the
                  suffering. Her own deep poverty, sickness, and anxious concern for her children
                  she counted as nothing to his lonely endurance of life.</p>
               <p>Some weeks before the expiration of the first term of imprisonment, she gathered
                  together all her little store, and having sold many heavy articles, packed the
                  rest, and had them started for Columbus, the capital of the state. She then took a
                  deck-passage for herself and children in a steamboat for Portsmouth, from which
                  place she determined to walk, carrying her youngest child, a little girl of nearly
                  three years, in her arms. I will not linger with her, nor trace her toilsome and
                  lonely journey through strange places, continued without a day's intermission,
                  until she at last came in sight of the long-looked-for place. After the time-worn
                  state-house, the next building that met her eye, was the old, dark-looking prison,
                  in which was confined her husband. How gladly did her eyes greet its sombre walls!
                  It was the dwelling-place of one, for whom, in all his wanderings, her heart
                  retained its warm emotions<pb n="494-495" xml:id="VAC5627-00000248"/> tions of
                  love. Suddenly, like a parching wind of the desert, came upon her the thought that
                  he might be dead. For three long years she had not been permitted to receive
                  tidings from him, and who could tell, if in that time, the wing of death had not
                  o'ershadowed him? Trembling, weary, and sick at heart, she made her way first to
                  the prison-gate, and there, to her unspeakable joy, she learned that he still
                  lived.</p>
               <p>For many nights previous to the day on which permission would be granted her to
                  see him, sleep had parted from her eyelids; and when the time did come, she was in
                  a high state of mental excitement. Morning slowly dawned upon her anxious eyes,
                  but seemed as if it would never give place to the broad daylight. At last the sun
                  came slowly up from his bright chambers in the east. It was the day on which she
                  should again see her husband; the long-looked-for, the long-hoped-for. Tremblingly
                  she stole out, ere the day was an hour old, and ran, not walked, to the gloomy
                  dwelling-place of her husband.</p>
               <p>For several days previous she had not been able to keep away from the prison, and
                  the keeper, who knew her errand, had become much interested in her case. He
                  received her kindly, and made instant preparation for the desired interview.</p>
               <p>For three years Warburton had not heard the music of a human voice. Far away from
                  the sight or sound of his fellow-prisoners, he had dwelt alone, visited only by
                  the mute keeper who had brought his daily food, or otherwise ministered to his
                  wants. To his earnest and oft-repeated inquiries if nothing was known of his wife
                  and children, for whose welfare a yearning anxiety had sprung up in his breast, he
                  was answered only by a gloomy silence. He did not know, even on the morning of his
                  release from solitary confinement, that the all-enduring companion of his better
                  days had come to cheer his anxious eyes with her presence. Soon after daylight of
                  this morning the door of his cell turned heavily on its hinges, and he was brought
                  out among his fellows, and heard again the sweetest music that had ever fallen
                  upon his ear, the music of the human voice. A stronger thrill of pleasure had
                  never passed through his frame. He felt as though he could remain thus shut out
                  from the rest of the world for ever, so that he could see and talk with his
                  fellow-men. He did not then think of the keen delight that awaited him, for in the
                  first impulse of selfish gratification he had forgotten the being who loved him
                  better than life.</p>
               <p>An hour had not passed when he was again called for. The door of a private
                  apartment in the keeper's house was thrown open, and he entered alone. There was
                  but one being present: a pale, haggard woman, poorly clad, who tottered towards
                  him with extended arms. At that moment both hearts were too full, and their lips
                  were sealed in silence. But oh! how eagerly did each bind the other in a long,
                  long embrace! It seemed as if their arms would never be unlocked. For one hour
                  were they left, thus alone. But how were years crowded into that hour; years of
                  endurance—terrible endurance!</p>
               <p>It seemed scarcely one-tenth of that short time, when Mrs. Warburton was summoned
                  away, but with the kind permission to visit her husband at the same hour every
                  day. Slowly she passed beneath the ponderous gate, and still more slowly moved
                  away, thinking how long it would be before another day had passed, bringing
                  another blessed interview.</p>
               <p>The case of Warburton and his faithful wife soon came to the ears of the governor,
                  and he having expressed considerable sympathy for them, the fact was soon made
                  known to Mrs. Warburton, who was recommended to petition him in person for a
                  remission of the sentence. The hint was no sooner given than acted upon, and after
                  a delay of several months of hope and fear, to the joy of her heart, she found her
                  husband at liberty.</p>
               <p>In some of his former business or gambling transactions he had become possessed of
                  a clear title to three hundred acres of land, upon which was a log-cabin, situated
                  about thirty miles eastward from the capital of the state, and nearly upon the
                  national road. Searching among his papers, still preserved by his wife, he found
                  the deed, and as nothing better offered, he started with his family and but ten
                  dollars, to begin the world anew as a backwoods farmer. The few articles of
                  furniture which his wife had preserved, served to render the dilapidated cabin, in
                  which was not a single pane of glass, sash, or shutter, barely<pb n="496-497"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000249"/> comfortable. It was early in the spring when they
                  re-moved, and though the right time for planting corn and the ordinary table
                  vegetables, yet it would be months before they would be fit to use. In the mean
                  time, a subsistence must be had. The quickest way to obtain food Warburton found
                  in the use of his rifle, for wild turkeys and deer abounded in the forest. He also
                  managed to take a few dozen turkeys now and then to a neighbouring town, and
                  dispose of them for corn-meal, flour, and groceries. In about a month he was
                  enabled to sell one hundred acres of his land for three hundred dollars, one
                  hundred in money, and the balance in necessary things for stocking a farm. He was
                  now fairly started again, with a cow, a horse, and all requisite agricultural
                  implements.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Warburton did not feel satisfied in her own mind that this sudden relief from
                  daily pressing want would be a real benefit to them. She had learned to suspect
                  the reformation which was effected by the force of external circumstances, while
                  no salutary change in the will was going on. For some time, however, she had every
                  reason to be encouraged. Her husband was industrious, and careful to make the best
                  he possibly could out of his farm, and was kind and attentive to her and his
                  children. Their garden, as the summer wore away, presented a rich supply of
                  vegetables, and their corn and potatoes in the fall yielded enough for their use
                  during the winter, besides several bushels for sale.</p>
               <p>The winter, however, did not pass away without several indications on the part of
                  Warburton of a disposition to indulge in the pleasures of the bottle. There had
                  been, in the course of the summer, a tavern erected, about a mile from his
                  dwelling, on the national road; and here, during the dull winter months, he too
                  frequently resorted, to pass away the hours, with such persons as are usually to
                  be found at these haunts of idleness.</p>
               <p>The income of this house, as a place of accommodation for travellers, was very
                  small, for within four miles of it stood a tavern and stage-house, kept in a style
                  that had made it known to the travelling public. It was simply a receptacle for
                  the odd change of the neighbours, at times when they had an hour or two to spare
                  from business. Gradually, its business increased, and as gradually the farms of
                  one or two individuals in the neighbourhood, who were, more frequently than
                  others, to be found at the tavern, evinced a corresponding decrease in their
                  flourishing condition. Fences that never wanted a panel were now broken in many
                  places; and barns that never admitted a drop of rain, now leaked at a hundred
                  pores. Once, there was an air of cheerfulness and plenty around their dwellings;
                  now, wives and children looked, the former troubled and broken in spirits, the
                  latter dirty and neglected. Where once reigned peace and quietness, existed
                  wrangling and strife.</p>
               <p>During the succeeding farming season, Warburton gave considerable
                  attention—cultivating his ground, which in the fall yielded him an abundant
                  return. Still, during the summer, he visited the "White Hall Tavern" too
                  frequently, and was too often under the bewildering and exciting influence of
                  liquor. The next winter tended greatly to complete the work of dissipation, which
                  had been commenced a year before. Frequently he would come home so much
                  intoxicated as to be lost to all reason. At such times he was not the stupid,
                  good-natured, drunken fool that is often met with; he was then a cruel,
                  unreasonable and exacting tyrant. His poor wife and children did not only suffer
                  from his wordy ill temper, but had to endure in silence his blows, and often
                  tremble even for their lives. When sober, an indistinct remembrance of his
                  cruelties and other bad conduct, instead of softening his feelings towards his
                  family, made him moodily silent, or cross and snappish if a word were said to
                  him.</p>
               <p>The constant and almost daily drain of small change for liquor, had nearly
                  exhausted all the money in the house long before the winter was over. The
                  accommodating landlord seemed to discover, as by instinct, this condition of
                  things, and encouraged Warburton to run up a score. He well knew that at any time
                  it was easy to get the payment out of a man who had a good farm, well stocked. Not
                  so much for the money to be made at the business, as for the purpose of attracting
                  more persons to his tavern, the landlord of the "White Hall" kept a small store.
                  At this store, Warburton, long before the winter was over, had also made a pretty
                  large bill. As if to atone for his unkindness to, and neglect of his family, he
                  would rarely<pb n="498-499" xml:id="VAC5627-00000250"/> return from his voluntary
                  visits at the tavern, without bringing home something. A few pounds of sugar
                  to-day, some cheese or fish to-morrow, or some dried fruit on the day after. The
                  excuse, that such and such a thing was wanted, was often made to get away to the
                  public house, and thus scarcely a day passed without a dollar or two being entered
                  against him on the books of the smiling landlord.</p>
               <p>When the spring opened, and his bill was made out, much to his surprise, he found
                  his account to be one hundred and fifty dollars! After some two or three weeks'
                  pondering on the matter, during which time he was cross and sulky at home, two
                  fine cows and one of his best horses were quietly transferred from his pasture to
                  the more capacious one of the landlord of the "White Hall;" and thus his account
                  was squared with Boniface.</p>
               <p>The discouragement consequent upon such a reduction of his stock, tended to make
                  him less industrious and less pleasant. He was constantly grumbling about his
                  expensive family, and could not afford to send his two oldest children to a school
                  just opened in the neighbourhood, although the master offered to take them both
                  for five dollars a quarter. His wife, he said, could teach them at home. And in
                  this she was not neglectful, as far as her time allowed.</p>
               <p>How rarely does the drunkard, when once fairly started, stop in his downward
                  course! How similar is the history of each one! Neglect of business—neglect of
                  family—confirmed idleness—abuse of family—waste of property—and finally, abject
                  poverty.</p>
               <p>In less than three years from the day on which he breathed the air again as a free
                  man—free, through the untiring assiduity of his neglected but faithful wife, he
                  struck her to the ground, and unregardful of all the ties of nature, left her
                  alone with her children, in the wilds of the west, after having made over house
                  and farm to the land lord of the "White Hall," for fifty dollars and his bill at
                  the bar.</p>
               <p>Day after day did his poor wife wait and look for him to return, until even hope
                  failed, and she at last, with a heavy heart, commenced the task of recalling her
                  own energies in aid of the little ones around her.</p>
               <p>But she soon found her condition to be far worse than she had imagined. But a few
                  days passed after her husband had left her before the hard-hearted tavern-keeper
                  came, and removed everything but the house in which she lived from off the place,
                  and then gave her notice that she must also remove, and in three weeks, as he had
                  rented the farm to a man who wished to take immediate possession.</p>
               <p>Hope, the kind and ever attendant angel of the distressed, for more than a week
                  seemed ready to depart; but at the end of that time, a faint desire to return to
                  her native city began to grow into a resolution, and by the time a second week had
                  passed away, she had fully resolved to set out upon the journey.</p>
               <p>But she had only twenty dollars, after disposing of the few things their rapacious
                  creditor had left them, and with this she had to go a journey of nearly five
                  hundred miles, with three children, the oldest about twelve years of age. But when
                  once her mind is made up, there are few things a resolute mother will not
                  undertake for her children.</p>
               <p>By persevering in her applications, day after day, to the wagoners on the national
                  road, she at length so far prevailed on one of them as to let her and her children
                  ride as far as Zanesville, for the trifle of a dollar or two, in his wagon.</p>
               <p>In the true spirit of success, she looked only at the present difficulty,
                  reserving thought and attention for all succeeding difficulties, whenever they
                  might come. In this spirit she cut herself loose from her place in the west, and
                  started for —— utterly unable to say how she should ever reach the desired
                  spot.</p>
               <p>For the first day or two, the wagoner held no conversation with her; he had been
                  unable to resist the promptings of his kind feelings in favour of one who had
                  asked him for aid, although he had much rather not have given her a place in his
                  wagon. By degrees, however, his temper changed, and he occasionally asked a
                  question, or made a passing remark; and by the time he had reached Zanesville, he
                  had become so interested in her case, that he refused to take the stipulated
                  price, and kindly offered to carry her as far as Wheeling, and to ——, if he found
                  it to his interest to go there.</p>
               <pb n="500-501" xml:id="VAC5627-00000251"/>
               <p>The way thus providentially opened for her, few obstacles remained, and in the
                  course of a few weeks she found herself again in the home of her childhood, the
                  dear spot that had lived in her memory, green and inviting, for years.</p>
               <p>But how changed was the poor sufferer! But a very few dollars of her money was
                  left. The fatigue of travel. ling so long and in so uncomfortable a manner, had
                  gradually shaken the props of a feeble body; and by the time she looked again upon
                  the old, familiar places, her form was drooping with sickness.</p>
               <p>Slowly she descended from the wagon, received her children, one by one, from the
                  hands of the wagoner, thanked him with a tearful look, and tottered away. But
                  where could she go? She had neither home, nor money, nor friends—was sick and
                  faint. Years before, she had tripped lightly along the very street through which
                  she now dragged her weary limbs. She even passed by the same house, and heard the
                  light laughter of thoughtless voices, from the same window from which she had once
                  looked forth in earlier years, a joyful and light-hearted creature. How familiar
                  did that dear spot seem! but how agonizing the contrast that forced itself upon
                  her! Little did the merry maiden who looked out upon the pale mother, with
                  drooping form and soiled garments, who gazed up so earnestly towards her, imagine,
                  that but a few years before, that poor creature looked forth from that same
                  window, a glad-hearted girl.</p>
               <p>Scarcely able to act or decide rationally, for her head ached intensely, and she
                  was burning with fever, Mrs. Warburton wandered about the streets with her three
                  children, one a boy about twelve years old, the other a little girl about nine,
                  and the third, a little one tottering by her side, scarce two years old. All at
                  once, as she turned her steps into —— street, her eye caught sight of the tall
                  poplars that indicated the home of the homeless. "I have no home but this," she
                  murmured to herself, and turned her steps instinctively towards the dark mass of
                  buildings that stood near the present intersection of —— and —— streets.</p>
               <p>"Where is your permit?" said the keeper, as she falteringly asked for
                  admission.</p>
               <p>"I have none," was the faint reply.</p>
               <p>"We cannot take you, unless you bring a permit from one of the commissioners."</p>
               <p>"I don't know any commissioner."</p>
               <p>"Where are you from?"</p>
               <p>"I have just come to town from the west, and am too sick to do anything. I feel
                  faint, and unable to go farther. Can you not admit me, and let application be made
                  to the commissioners for me?"</p>
               <p>The appearance of Mrs. Warburton too plainly indicated her sick condition, and the
                  keeper thought it best to admit her for the present. A meeting of the
                  commissioners was held on the same afternoon, and a formal admission given.</p>
               <p>The first indication that Mrs. W. had, that she was no longer at liberty to choose
                  or think for herself, was the entire separation of her children from her. True,
                  she was soon too ill to attend to them, but that would have made no difference.
                  After a dangerous illness of many weeks, during most of which time she was
                  insensible to everything around her, she was again able to droop about a little.
                  Her first questions, after the healthy reaction of body and mind, were about her
                  children; her first request, to see them. But this was denied. "They are doing
                  well enough," was all the answer she could get.</p>
               <p>"But cannot I see Emma, my little one? Do let me see her!"</p>
               <p>"It is contrary to the rules of the institution. You cannot see her now."</p>
               <p>"When can I see her?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know,"—and the nurse of the sick woman left her and went to attend
                  somewhere else, utterly insensible to the keen agony of the mother's heart. Was
                  she not a pauper? What right had she to human feelings? But a mother's love is not
                  to be chained down to rules, or circumscribed by the narrow policy of chartered
                  expediency. As Mrs. Warburton slowly gained strength, a quicker perception of her
                  situation grew upon her, and she soon determined to know all about her children.
                  In vain had she asked to see them; but each denial only increased the desire, and
                  confirmed her resolutions to see them and know all about them.</p>
               <pb n="502-503" xml:id="VAC5627-00000252"/>
               <p>One day, when she could walk about a little, a day on which she knew the board of
                  commissioners were in session, she watched her opportunity, and when the nurse was
                  attending in another part of the room, stole quietly out, and soon made her way to
                  the commissioners' room.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, a mother asks your indulgence," was her appeal, as the keeper checked
                  her entrance.</p>
               <p>"Let her enter, Mr. ——," said one of them.</p>
               <p>"What is your wish, good woman?" continued the first speaker.</p>
               <p>"I want to see my children."</p>
               <p>Her voice was so low and mournful, and her pale face, which still retained many
                  traces of former beauty, expressed so strongly her maternal anxiety, that the
                  hearts of all were touched.</p>
               <p>They looked at each other for a few moments, and after some whispered words,
                  directed that she should be allowed to see her children for half an hour each
                  day.</p>
               <p>The keeper now called their attention to certain of their proceedings, some weeks
                  past, and they found that places had been obtained for two of them, the oldest
                  boy, and the little girl, scarce ten years old.</p>
               <p>"We have obtained good places for two of your children, madam; the other, aged two
                  years, you can have under your own care, while here."</p>
               <p>"And all without allowing me one word, as to who should take them, or where they
                  should go! My poor little Mary, what can you do as a servant?"</p>
               <p>"They are well provided for, madam. You can now retire."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Warburton did retire, and with a bleeding heart. Her little Emma was restored
                  to her, and was constantly by her side. She had been two months in the alms-house,
                  when she was strong enough to work, and by a rule of he place, she had to work two
                  months, to pay for her keeping while sick, before she would be allowed to go out,
                  and maintain herself.</p>
               <p>Slowly and heavily passed the hours for two weary months, when she presented
                  herself for a release from imprisonment.</p>
               <p>"Where can I find my children?" she asked of the keeper, as she was about to
                  leave.</p>
               <p>"It is against the rule to give any such information in regard to pauper children.
                  And in this particular instance, it was the request of both persons taking your
                  children, that you should not be told where they were, as they wished to raise
                  them without being troubled by foreign influence."</p>
               <p>The mother attempted no remonstrance, but turned away, and homeless, and almost
                  penniless, leading her little one by the hand, again entered the city where her
                  happiest years had been spent.</p>
               <p>As she passed down a street, she saw on the door of an old brick house, the words
                  "A room to let." She made application, and engaged it, at two dollars a month. A
                  pine table, and an old chair, she bought at a second-hand furniture store for a
                  dollar; and with the other dollar she had left, the pittance saved from the twenty
                  dollars she had when she left Ohio, she bought some bread, dried meat, milk,
                  &amp;c. She had no bed, and was for some time compelled to sleep with her child on
                  the hard floor.</p>
               <p>The art of making cigars, which she had learned years before, and which had more
                  than once stood between her and want, was again brought into use. She applied at a
                  tobacconist's, and obtained work. Giving all diligence, day and night, she was
                  able to make five or six dollars every week, with which, in a short time, she
                  gathered a few comfortable things about her, among which was a bed.</p>
               <p>Two months had passed since she left the alms-house, and still she could gain no
                  tidings of her children. Daily, for an hour or two, had she made search for them,
                  but in the only way she could devise, that of wandering about the streets, in
                  hopes of finding them out on some errand. As the winter drew on, she became more
                  and more anxious and concerned. If her little girl, who was always a delicate
                  child, should be in unkind hands, she sickened at heart to think how much she
                  would suffer. Night after night would she dream of the dear child; and always saw
                  her in some condition of extreme hardship.</p>
               <p>One night she thought she saw little Mary sitting on the curb-stone. She went up
                  to her, and dreaming that it was very cold, found her bare-foot, thinly clad, and
                  almost perishing. The child threw her little arms, naked<pb n="504-505"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000253"/> and icy cold about her neck, and as her well-known
                  voice sounded in her ears, she awoke.</p>
               <p>She slept no more through that night, and soon after breakfast, started out, being
                  unable, through the uneasiness of her mind, to work. Without questioning the
                  reason why, she naturally wandered in the direction indicated in her dream. When
                  near the place, she was startled by the piercing screams of a child that seemed in
                  great agony, and there was entreaty and supplication mingled in the tones. The
                  voice was like the voice of her own child. She knew it was her own child; a
                  mother's ear is never deceived. Darting towards the spot, she found a bucket of
                  hot water spilled upon the pavement, from which the vapour was rising in a cloud,
                  and glancing her eye down the alley, she saw her little one half-dragged,
                  half-carried, by the arm, by a tall, masculine woman, who seemed in a violent
                  rage. Following like the wind, she reached the dwelling of the virago as she
                  entered and dashed the child upon the floor. Just as Mrs. Warburton came up, and
                  was lifting it, the woman had obtained a stout cow-hide, and was turning to
                  lacerate the back of the little one, as she had often done before, her face red
                  and expressing the most wicked passions.</p>
               <p>At once Mrs. Warburton felt that only in retreat was their safety, and catching up
                  the child in her arms, she darted out as quickly as she had entered. Not more
                  swiftly, however, did she go, than followed the enraged woman to whom this child
                  of nine years old had been bound to do the work of a woman. Finding herself gained
                  upon by the person in pursuit, she looked about for a place of retreat, and seeing
                  "Magistrate's Office" on a sign, she darted into that lower court of justice. Here
                  she was safe from molestation, until some decision was made in the case, by those
                  deputed to act. A crowd soon gathered about, attracted by the strange sight of a
                  woman flying with a child in her arms, and another in hot pursuit. The magistrate,
                  who was a humane man, and held his office in a part of his dwelling, instinctively
                  perceived that the mother and her child needed kindness and consideration, and had
                  them, after examination, removed back into his dwelling, and placed under the care
                  of his wife, while he entered more fully into the merits of the case.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Warburton was sufficiently at ease to examine her child, she found her a
                  pitiable object indeed. Her face, neck, and body were dreadfully scalded, and her
                  back was in scars and welts all over, and in some places with the skin broken and
                  festering. It appeared, from the statement of the child, that the woman she lived
                  with had placed on her head a bucket of scalding water for her to carry to a
                  store, which she was going to scrub out. The heavy weight on her head caused her
                  to lose her balance and fall, when the whole contents of the bucket were spilled
                  over her face and neck, and penetrated through her clothes to the skin, in all
                  directions.</p>
               <p>Of course, she was suffering the most excruciating pain. Medical aid was called in
                  by the magistrate, and every attention extended to the little sufferer, who seemed
                  to forget her pain in the consciousness of her mother's presence. The inhuman
                  wretch who had thus brutally maltreated a mere child, enraged to a state of
                  insanity in finding herself thwarted in obtaining the child, made an appeal to the
                  city court, then in session, and had all the parties present. It needed but this
                  to give Mrs. W. uncontrolled possession of little Mary. The condition in which the
                  court found the child, added to the touching story of her mother, caused an
                  instant cancelling of the indenture by which the unfeeling woman claimed
                  possession of her.</p>
               <p>In a few days after, Mrs. Warburton found her boy, who, much to her satisfaction,
                  had a good place, with which he was pleased, and was learning a good trade. She
                  was now fairly started again, and as her spirits revived, her health became much
                  improved. Month after month passed away, and brought with it new sources of
                  comfort, new causes for satisfaction. Of her husband, she now thought with no
                  affection. It is true, earlier feelings would sometimes return, but with no force,
                  and after moving the waters of her quiet spirit for a moment, would tremble into
                  rest.</p>
               <p>When a man once extinguishes his own self-respect, he is a burden to society. But
                  when a husband and father descends so low, he becomes a curse to his family. After
                  abusing them, and making their condition so wretched<pb n="506-507"
                     xml:id="VAC5627-00000254"/> that even he cannot share it, he will forsake the
                  wife of his bosom and the children of his early love, and leave them to the tender
                  mercies of strangers. But let the mother gather her little ones around her, and by
                  toiling early and late, make their condition comfortable, and the brutalized
                  wretch will return and consume the food of his children, and abuse them if they
                  complain.</p>
               <p>A year had passed away, when early one evening in the fall of the year, a man
                  pushed open the door of the room she occupied, and with a "well Julia," took a
                  chair, and made himself at home without further ceremony. Though dirty and ragged,
                  with a beard of a week's growth, and half drunk, Mrs. Warburton could not mistake
                  the form of her wretched husband.</p>
               <p>"O, husband! can this be you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Julia, this is me. I've come back at last. I've tried hard to make something
                  for you and the children, but it is no use, fate is against me; so here I am
                  again, poor as ever. But give me something to eat, for I'm hungry as a
                  badger."</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Six years had passed away since Warburton had returned, and the wretchedness which
                  had been with him in his absence, he brought as an abiding guest to the dwelling
                  of his wife. During that time, she had endured sickness, hunger, abuse, and been
                  nigh unto death; but through it all she had come with a heart still unsubdued,
                  though almost broken. For her children's sakes, two more of whom had been added in
                  that time, she had stood up and breasted the storm.</p>
               <p>At last, her miserable husband, sunk in the lowest depths of drunkenness and
                  degradation, died, as he had lived. It was the dawn of a brighter day for Mrs.
                  Warburton when the spirit of her husband took its flight to the world of spirits.
                  Her son was nearly free from his trade, and her oldest girl could assist her
                  greatly in the house, as well as by earning something for their support.</p>
               <p>Content and health having taken up their abode with her, we will leave her to fill
                  up her allotted space in life unobtrusively and peacefully. The story of Mrs.
                  Warburton has been introduced as another illustration of the ill effects which so
                  often arise from the want of watchfulness on the part of parents, in regard to the
                  characters of the young men who are allowed to visit and play upon the affections
                  of their daughters. It also shows how unconquerable is a mother's love. Here a
                  weak, foolish girl, by strong trial, becomes a woman with a strength of mind that
                  nothing can subdue, and, as a mother, overcomes difficulties from which most men
                  would shrink in despair.</p>

               <head>NOTICES OF THE PRESS.</head>
               <item>The present volume, containing more than four hundred finely printed octavo
                  pages, is illustrated by spirited engravings, and made particularly valuable to
                  those who like to "see the face of him they talk withal," by a correct likeness of
                  the author, finely engraved on steel.—<title>Neal's Gazette</title>.</item>
               <item>In the princely mansions of the Atlantic merchants, and in the rude log cabins
                  of the backwoodsman, the name of Arthur is equally known and cherished as the
                  friend of virtue.—<title>Graham's Magazine</title>.</item>
               <item>We would not exchange our copy of these sketches, with its story of "The
                  Methodist Preacher," for any one of the gilt-edged and embossed annuals which we
                  have yet seen.—<title>Lady's National Magazine</title>.</item>
               <item>The first story in the volume, entitled "The Methodist Preacher, or Lights and
                  Shadows in the Life of an Itinerant," is alone worth the price of the
                     work.—<title>Evening Bulletin</title>.</item>
               <item>It is emphatically a splendid work.—<title>Middletown Whig</title>.</item>
               <item>Its worth and cheapness should place it in every person's hands who desire to
                  read an interesting book.—<title>Odd Fellow, Boonsboro</title>.</item>
               <item>"The Methodist Preacher," "Seed Time and Harvest," "Dyed in the Wool," are full
                  of truth, as well as instruction, and any one of them is worth the whole price of
                  the volume.—<title>Lowell Daystar, Rev. D. C. Eddy, Editor</title>.</item>
               <item>There is a fascination about these sketches which so powerfully interests the
                  reader, that few who commence one of them will part with it till it is concluded;
                  and they will bear reading repeatedly.—<title>Norfolk and Portsmouth
                     Herald</title>.</item>
               <item>Those who have not perused these model stories have a rich feast in waiting,
                  and we shall be happy if we can be instrumental in pointing them to
                     it.—<title>Family Visitor, Madison, Geo.</title>
               </item>
               <item>No library for family reading should be considered complete without this
                  volume, which is as lively and entertaining in its character as it is salutary in
                  its influence.—<title>N. Y. Tribune</title>.</item>
               <item>The work is beautifully illustrated. Those who are at all acquainted with
                  Arthur's writings need hardly be told that the present work is a prize to whoever
                  possess it.—<title>New York Sun</title>.</item>

                  neat exterior or valuable contents.—<title>Vox Populi, Low</title>.</item>
               <item>The name of the author is in itself a sufficient recommendation of the
                     work.—<title>Lawrence Sentinel</title>.</item>

                     Circleville, Ohio</title>.</item>
               <item>The name alone of the author is a sufficient guaranty to the reading public of
                  its surpassing merit.—<title>The Argus Gallatin, Miss</title>.</item>

            <p>NOTICES OF THE PRESS.</p>
            <p>It is not too much to say, that the Golden Grains here presented to the reader, are
               such as will be productive of a far greater amount of human happiness than those in
               search of which so many are willing to risk domestic peace, health, and even life
               itself, in a distant and inhospitable region.</p>
            <p>These narratives, like all of those which proceed from the same able pen, are
               remarkable not only for their entertaining and lively pictures of actual life, but
               for their admirable moral tendency.</p>

            <div type="advertisement">
               <head>GREAT EVENTS IN MODERN HISTORY.</head>
               <p>Comprising the MOST REMARKABLE DISCOVERIES, CONQUESTS, REVOLUTIONS, GREAT BATTLES,
                  and other Thrilling Incidents, chiefly in Europe and America, from the
                  commencement of the Sixteenth Century to the present time. Embellished with over
                  500 Engravings by W. CROOME, and other eminent artists. The following are extracts
                  from notices of the press received by the Publisher.</p>
               <p>NOTICES OF THE PRESS.</p>
               <p>"We have here, within the compass of eight hundred pages, the history of those
                  events of modern history, which have been 'big with mighty consequences,' and with
                  which, therefore, all men should become acquainted. Beginning with the discovery
                  of America, by Columbus—that new starting-point of civilization—the work proceeds
                  through the history of the various European nations, culling those great periods
                  when, either by wars or revolutions, each nation began to occupy a conspicuous
                  place in the general estimation of men, and to make its influence felt by those
                  without its limits. The late revolutions in Europe, the Mexican war, and the gold
                  discoveries in California, are rapidly and vividly sketched. The illustrations,
                  principally from designs by Croome, are numerous, well executed, serving to
                  impress the striking scenes and characters of history upon the tablet of memory.
                  The whole work, in design and execution, reflects great credit upon all concerned
                  in its production."</p>

               <head>Thrilling Adventures among the Indians.</head>
               <p>Comprising the most remarkable Personal Narratives of events in the early INDIAN
                  WARS, as well as of Incidents in the recent Indian Hostilities in Mexico and
                  Texas. Illustrated with over 300 Engravings, from designs by W, CROOME, and other
                  distinguished Artists.</p>
               <p>NOTICES OF THE PRESS.</p>
               <p>"The matter contained in this handsome volume is as well calculated to give a
                  correct idea of the character of the Indians and their modes of life, as that of
                  any book ever published. All that gives a charm to romance may be found in the
                  narrative contained in this work, but all of them possess the never-failing
                  attractions of truth. The sufferings of numerous captives are also detailed,
                  together with their contrivances of escape from. their savage captors. The
                  illustrations by the well-known W. Croome, are excellent in design and execution,
                  and the printing and binding of the work are fine specimens of each art."</p>
