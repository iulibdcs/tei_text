Preface! ,The very sound calls to memory feelings mingled with emotions of pleasure and pain,which alter- natcly filled my mind, while under my pen lines turned into pages, pages into chapters, and chaplters into a book. It was a pleasure to know that truth was attaillable, for the light had revealed it; but it was painful to know that it was but little understood, and less regarded. These pages did not emanate from a thirst for gain, or the love of fame; but from a dcsire that some whlo may chance to read them, and follow the writer in these investigations, migiht be enabled to perceive the truth with greater clear- ness, and cmbrace it more fervently. Should this prove true ill any instance, and one, cxvri one, be inlduced to de- part from- error and turn to the truth as it is in Jesus, the writer will deem herself fully rewarded for all her trou- ble, and feel to rejoice, and give thanks to Hin who led her to devise the plan, and gave her strenlgtl to complete its execution as it is now preselnted to the reader. As the body needs rest after seasons of toil, so ,does the mind need relief after periods of continued andt active thougltt. To afford, to tlose wlho may clhance fo accom- pany me through this toil of investigation, this much needed repose, I ]iave prepared them resting places and refreshments, ill the more alluring fields of fancy. This; is my apology to the reader for the thread of romance woven into the web of this volume. Ald now, dear reader, I pray you, if" ye haye received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him; for thus it be- cometh us to fulfill all righteousness." A ,.   CHLAPTER I. THE BAPTIST. "As concerning this sect, we know that everywhere, it is spoken against.' ACTS xxviii. 22. "WE are to have some new neighbors, Annie," said Mr. Bacon, as he passed his cuD tio be refilled with the aromatic  decoction of the real Juva coffee,-llhich tempteld th lfactory nerves with its irresistible odor, as it steamed from the glittering urn. "( Which?-'Teiants of Mrs. Wilson's house, father!" "Yes, and rather an unpleasant affair. too, tlat is, I had rather for some other character to be so ;lose b)y." This was said in such a tone, that it elicited fuitlhr in-  quiry of the daughter.               - "What character, father?" she asked, as she return- ed tie cup replenished with the esculent drink.  "A Baptist preacher of the strictest sect, and an advo-  cate of close communion, too, I suppose." "A Baptist preacher?-llas he any family?" "I should judge so," lie responded, helpingl himself to the second piece of -steak, "the residence he has taken warrants that inference."  "Where did le come from? who is he? is he much?" asked the daughter, in one breath. "It is not probable that he is much, though he has taken a very good house. Where lie camefrom, I camnnot tell. I guess though, from some hole of poverty, for you know as a class, they live from hand to mouth. I can't imagine why he has come here."  ,The conversation just related, passed between Mr. Bacon and his daughter, an only child.  The father was a wealthy stockltolder, living in the  little town of M--, situated on tjOho river. His house, which stood in the subuts;rtnatndiig n t fine view of the river, was the most hauti-me, and u )ique  in the -place. Indeed, its massive walis aud i-eavy pan-  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8270-00000006"/> OB 5       LEALNDEER HALL. neleod doors, colossal columns, and perforated cresset, whch lifted up1 its hlead, as the never-failingl beacon, tob tile telmpest t)osscd-nlariner, waVs oni the 1whole, a striking figule r, well calculattld to carry one's minid back to tile gliimplss of atitiqiatcd rutihs, as handed us by the twilight glimmer of the historian's pen. The country' around tad giveil it the nane of Leander Hall, because attached tlhereto, was a splendfid library, thie selections of which "were t le bestt plroductions fromt the annals of history. And it lent a glowing light to the students of tlat vicinity, ilnsonmucll t)hat anlly mad- it a hlappy resort, there to gratify their thirst for kuowlcdge amidst records of human wisdom,. Mr. Bacon had but one clild,-Anthe, before referred to. Of her-fitthler's nlaturo, she shared largely i deter- niination, which since growing I uip,bcgan to display itself in divers xvaIys. The mtother, who had long since gone to rest, I:ad left but teiw lillcanienits of herself in tihe daugltcr,for perpetuation. One radical feature however, still survived, to exemplify in after diys tic clharacter of the deceased, ad that was, principle before policy, a com- modity now-a-day almost obsolete. Mr. Bacon was a strong advocate of mixed communion. As to religion, le boasted of but little, prejudices and ultraism being the chief comDonents of his zeal. lie was a staucllh uncompromising Methodist. So engrossed was lie, thlat as far as the advancement of the cause, and fivor e at his hands were concerned, lhe sanctioned the betrotlhment of his daughlter to the Methodist circuit rider, whom we will call Mr. Sumner. Hence the tenor of the conversation between the fiather and daughter. But-to return to the subjects as we left them. As Mr. Bacon passed out of the dining room to his study, Annie followed him, it being a conceded preroga- tive to lher to exercise whsetever she chose. ;  "What is the name of that Baptist preacher, father, of whomn you were speaking?" she asked, taking a seat near his own.      ,    . "- Weston, I believe, and I wish him much western from here. B(t this is always the way; if you lose a good ^ n: ieighlblr a bad one comes il his place. I suppose lie hlas come here to collect the scattered- sheep of his fold, which if I am not mistaken, aeed a new organization ill   THE BAPTIST.           7 !o to. There is Mr. Norman, who drinks as much at any worldly man in M---, and professes to belong to the IBaptists--blJt the Baptists, you know, are proverbial for loving whIisky. In fact, tlere are but three members in the whole ilace, worth a cent to a Church. Most of the mlde mrembers have gone to the Reformers, or Methodists, because they could not'stand close communion. This close comnlunion is a schente which the world won't tol- erate nmlch longer-it will breakdown the Baptists some day, I Ipredict." rll. B1acon made this speech with so much- warmth, that Alnie became more interested, consequently she urgedl hinit further. "The Bapltists never have meeting here now,' she re- markfed, anxious to continue the conversation. "Oil well, that's no reason why he'll not try to plaster over tleir tifults, and build up a selfish class, which I've no (dolbt, in time, will become so extreme, that they will forbid miembnrs o of other denominationscominq to their ClurchP' "Oh 1n, fitlIer, not so radical as that!" pleaded Annie, who was disposed to be more lenient to the followers of the " despised Nazarene." ;Well, you'll see. Mark what I tell you: that man Weston will have a fuss with some citizen before he is here two weeks, about this very thing!" During the conversation, a servant announced a visitor, wlherullpon, Annie left her fither's study to go to the parlor, to meet Mr. Sumner, who was there waiting. "I've just called a few moments, Annie," he said, hand- ing her a chair. "I'n in great haste, but wished to in- form you of the coming of somevery distinguished neigh- bors to the vacant house over the way."-  "Father has just been telling me about tlem." "Btut you havn't heard all. The funniest of it is, he (Mr. Sumner had reference to the Baptist preacher,) is going to try to gather the fragments of the Church which  preacher Sampson split asunder when he went to the Reformers, because he did not believe in Close commu- nion. They certainly can't expect to do much in this  place; the people are too intelligent at this day, forthat! ' he added'" witl emphasis of voice, accompanied with an expressive gesticulation. "Father has just prophesied what you've told me."  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8270-00000007"/> 8       LEANDER HALL. "Then I have notliing new for you; but I was going to say, that all-the people in M--- will go to hear him next Sabbath, as there wiill be no other meeting. It will be a real monkey show to themn,it has been so long since a Baptist has preached here. It is a pity I have to go out in the country to one of my stations; if not, 1'd just hold a meeting, to keep my congregation away. It will do them too much good to have their Church full. Old man Cheevers, Dr. Goodwin, and Mr. Logan, are about al! the j male members in the place, except Mr. Norman, and you know he is drunk half of his time. I wonder what they will do with him? they can't turn him out, for there'll be no quorum, unlesathey take the darkies in their couucil." "Mr. Norman, I'm told, requested the brethren to take his name off of the Church book, some time ago. This I heard from one of our house servants, who attended their prayer meetings, but I had almost forgotten it," said ' Annie. ( Then it will be a trio-Church," laughingly remarked Mr. Sumier. "But I must go," he said, rising to his feet. "Do you wish to go out to Mt. Zion next Sabbath? Several of the brethren are going, to my certain kinowl- edge, and if I mistake not, sister Young and daughter intend :going."' Mr. Sumner wished them all to go, rather than stay and hear that Baptist preacher.: HO knew that the citi- zens of M--  were a Church-going people. and he felt instindtively that something was to be feared therefrom. N"o, I thank yOe, I cannot go. I saw Mrs. Young yesterday. She expressed a great desire to go, but said that the weather Was so warm, and it was so far, that sle could not. I'll go out with you to Pea Ridge, your next appointment." -"And that will be Sunday after next, the third Sab. :  batha, remember. Good morning." " ' .. 'GoOdil morni ng." '-  ;    . When .the sound of his footsteps died away, Annie -   soughtl her room, sat down, and began to reflect. A :-  Bapltist preacher was coming to M-- , to preach, as was conjetuired, close communion! The very biidtd 'seermed ;   to-be promonitory of sombthilg startling1, whse refection, though faint, was sufficient to warnl insitinetively, thoso who yielded to such tmonitors. "Why did the ,apitits ;..'   .     .  , i S-5    T E  APT i.'. ,I sS I' *             .** "**X'.  cling so tenaciously to the ill-famed dogma, close commu- nion? .Wlly so selfish and uncharitable?" shc-wondered. In the town of M-   there were tlree Chlurches-the Methodist, the Reformer, and the Baptist. Thle Re- form Church was greatly in the ascendenlcy, numerically. When the great current Reformation swept (over this 'State, in its palmiest days, it spared not the illabitants ot M---. Many yielded to its fiacinating waves, until the mrelstrom had added to the mount of Bethany,fifty souls, rejoicing in the new found plan of redlempltion-Baptism for the remission of sims!. The Baptists suffered much in consequence thereof, for close communion had long been an unpopnlar doctrine with the world, and at that time had its effect. Methodism too, was slightly scathed by the flames, but they freely quenched the lapping waves with the cries of "free communnion " which saved many. Mr. Sumner told the truth, when he said there were but three male members in the Church, and tlese liad'- waited patiently the visitation of the lord, "choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of popularity for a season; esteem- ing the reproach of Christ greater riches, than the treasures of Bethany, for tley lhald relsp:ect unto the re- compense of reward, . . -. --knowing thlat chastening for the present was unpleasant, nevertheless, afterward it yielded the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby." Mr. Weston mo\ed to Mk-- the week designated, and took the vacant thouse close by Mr. Bacon. Ilis family consisted of his wife, two daughter^s, and sevcral servants. There were no outward pretensions of ostentation about the family. Their furniture wast plait and nice, their servants well trained, and plenty for the sizeoof the fimily. Mr. Weston was a staid, dignified looking man, about fifty years of age. Mrs. Weston was ldain i appearance, and possessed quite an intelligent look, strongly!l gled witl benevolence. Mollie-the eldest daugit-L(irtess- ed a face, on which the eye Wvould love to gaze 'ut"iiter- ruptedly fir hoturs. Slhe was not so pretty, lbut there 'was something so interestinmg-so a rbing about ler  countenance, that one look thereon, only generated tle wish for another. The youngest daughter, Eva, .was a  sweet-faced girl, of about ten sunimmers, of which we will Ibave more to say in time to come,  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8270-00000008"/> ,[                         i 10       LEANDER HALL. ;-  - Sabbath morning dawned! A day in the history of IC,  tthe'Baptists in Kentucky. The old bell }ffixed to the dilapidated steeple of the Baptist Cllurclh began its chim- ing. Long yealrs had intervenCed since its music had called together God's people for worship. Thl'l belfry trenmbled, as if surprised at the unusual vibration of his sacredl clarge. ' "There's the bell!-signal I suppose, for the three mem- bers! Are you going Annie?" asked Mr. Bacon, as they sat at the brealkast table. "I don't-really I hadn't thonghlt much about it. Are you, father? I expect the people will turn out generally," she answered, hesitatingly. Mr. Bacon saw that Annie wanted to go, and only awaited his sanction, so he said: If you wish to go, go, as for my part, I don't wish to be Caught with suchl a selfish set. "But father, all our brethren will be there," she plead- ed, as an inducement. "Let them go. It' they wish to turn simpletons, that's no reason why Ishould! This was said in such a tone that Annie was inclilled to sacrifice her wishes, and remain at home; and just as she was about to act upon this 'resolution, M1r. Weston and family passed by, on tleir way hitler, iwhichl strongly prevailed against her predeterminatioin, anld wlhich caused her to risk the consequences, and venturejust tiis one time. She went, and so did many otlers. The Chricll was full to excess. The sermon was concise and to the point. The text being-"Fear not little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdomn"(Luke, :xii: 32.) We do not clain super-eloquence forthe lpreach- er in question, but he certainly spoke with irresistibll   reason and force.. The little flock ;was comforted wit}) the promise that, the Church of God should vet 1iprosP(ir in their hands.,!, At the conclusion of the discourse, the door of th Church was opened. A colored woman was the i ni! 'accession. Baptism was announced for three ocloi!.  Then came the Lord's Supper. A breathless silence i: the congregation prevailed!         ' "Would he invite all Christians?"   - TIt BAPTIST.         I The sncrea element was before the audience. lMust any go away without particilatioll? Those wlio professed to love Christ-who were Christians [proifessedly,]-wlho had partaken of the Lord's Supper, in joillt ltarticirpatiol, must they go away " hungry"? or " tarry cue fo)r another," and( "have all things in common "? The nintister arose, a blessing invoked, and- "Come ye that are indeed the followers of Christ- have beenl 'born from above'-submitted to his; rcquire: ments, and are in nmembership with I is Church--come let us celebrate tills sacred ordirance togetlher. ' Let a man examine himself, and so let him cat,' says the apostle." The die was cast! The seats allottc d for the com- raunlicants were only occuplied by the little lhaDdfill of Baptists that were present. Who was to blalne? Whel'e are thine accusers? conscience! conscience!! conscience forbade!!! Were they baptized " into Christ's deatl?" or "for the remission of sins?"Were they baptized at all? I speak of the several denoninations that were present. Baptism if error, makes no difference of what mode, is no baptism at all, as the twdve disciples at Ehllesus. Annie returned home puzzled. She was pleased with the preacher, but the close cummunion! what was to be done with that? She was also strongly prelossesseil with the sweet face of Mollie Weston, and determined to make her acquaintance the earliest olprportulity. Well my daughter," addressed Mr. Bacon, as they seated themselves at the dinner table, "I suppose you went to hear that 'one-sighted' man preach to-day?"' You will join them by next Sabbath-lie? ".Not at all, father! I was-I confess-much pleased with his appearance, and his daughter's, but the doctrine that he preaches, don't suit me. I can't take their close communion." "What!-did they have close communion to-day? began it already? Just as I told you!" "But father, I know they are honest in their convictions." "Ionest the mischief!-tut, tut, all but honest! Well, why do they practice it?" "Ignorancel! ignorance is at the bottom of it.", "Then wlhy don't some one try to enlightenl them? I'm sure it is the duty of all Christians to .make the cffort."  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8270-00000009"/> 12       LEANDER HALL. "No; it's no use. They are as bigoted and selfish  [  - they can be! Convin'ce?-why you mnight'as well tl to soften a rock with water!" "But yo*ull like the preachler so well that you'll fe D    sorry fori his ignorance, and I'm sure will try to elighte 1   lhim. Dr. Boon walked home with me; you know h tW r is a staunch Reformer; he says that he thinks it our d,t f cto talk witl M r. Weston on the subhiect. lie thinks M i:  Weston is a good man, and ought to be warned of tl evil consequences of cloie communion." "Dr. Boon is a man of fine sense. Id like to see 1im or Bro. Surnner get hold of Mr. Weston! How he iwoul :  ^writhe!" and the old man rubbed his hands in deligl: ;  at the idea. Early Monday morning, the excitement began to sprea }  aamong the female population. / ,; Mrs. Standford's parlor was crowded with lady visitor paying mornffiq calls. The preacher and family, and clos I    conmmunion, were the topics of the day.  "I do think," said Miss Matilda Lankinston, a spin ster, (whlo was nlear despairing of ever'mnarrying, an niakiing the best of her disappointment in the free use o her tolnue,) it is the most unheard of, and uncalled fo thing, I ever knew in my life!

I thought the all looked very self conceited, as though they were doini God's righteous will." "Well, 1 woulldn't have been them, for the world,' c'himed in agawRi, Miss Lankinston. :    ' L"I wish 11ro)ther Alexander Campbell were here', p.: in a Sist e Refformer, il a very sentirmntal tone.

And thus the town was astir on the question. Annie Bacon lost no time in making the acquaintance of Mr. Weston's family. She called early on the fiolow- ilg morning, in company with several ladi'es, to pay ler devoirs to the beautiful Miss Weston, whose expressive falce had won so many learts, on the day previoW ly. 'Dr. Boon, lwho was also fscinated with Miss \V estol, calledl at Mr. Bacon's that evecting after tea. The ar- 1raigenenit was, fir Annie to call first, and then introduce hilm. To this effect was the latter's visit. It may he here necessary to give a slight insight into Dr. Boon's chlaracter. e was one of the practitioners of --, a physician of good standing, and with a tine field of labor before him. He was la man in every way worthy of respect, as far as worldly alifirs went. lHe was an ideal otf manliness; not to bc classed with a man built up of scufflings, toils, alnd dits of econlomv, but was endowed freely ith the compllosition of .nobler qualities. i There was ever a spirit of effervescing liberality about him. It he were wrong in any tiling, it was friom igno- rance, though not for the want of ability; but the result of neglect. iHe knew nothing of policy. As I have be. fore told you, he was an open commum}ionist in toto. Close communion was the most re:,ugnant of all principles ad- vocated by the religious world, to his knowledge. "Why, Miss Annie," said he, as they were conversing on the subject that evening,. "if I had led my bride to the altar, ready to consunmmate our vows, and she were to tell me then, that she could not commune with my Church-that is, if she belonged to any other Church than nine-I would  -"  Dr. Booi h(sitatcd. The words on his lips which were about to be uttered, were too hard. "W What could you do, Doctor, but marry her?" asked Annie, smiling at his excitement. "I must tell you, if I did, I would have to change from what I am now," he answered significantly. "Oh, well, that's of no importance, any way; tell me when you wish to visit our friend over the way?" "Just as soon as it suits your convenience."  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8270-00000010"/> "        LEAn'DEH nAtL. -   -9 "Which w-ill bo at any time. But I forgot to tell y, the news."

Dr. Boon became very thoughtful. They walked on in silenc e until they reached the veranda. s aw "Won't you colme in, Doctor?" asked Annie, when she saw 1him hesitate. ' No, I thank you, Miss Annie. I promised to be at the shop by ten," lie replied, taking ont his watch. "You'll be present when they begin the investigation, won't yout?" "Most assmledly, if business don't prevent." "And you nmust call to niiind all your theological lore, for you may have to encounter more than you think," she laughingly slggested. . "No da:iiger of that, Miss Annie; no danger to be ap- prehended at all. There is not a passage in the whole Bible that would go, to prove the consistency of close com- nlunion. Good night." "Good night, Doctor; call often, in order that you may keep posted about the matter." "Thank you, I will." Mr. Sumnler returned from the country on the ensuing Wednesday.

He looked around upon nature's cha rms, as she breathed her evening requiem to the monuments of "Time. He saw the darkling forest robed in 'the shades of twilight, drinking thl, cooling breezes as if to satiate the thirst which th day-god had made ere he withdrew his pungent rays to other climes. "' Ah, these as well as the animate creation, display the attributes of Deity 1" he exclaimed in a strain of happy feeling. "How nluch they teach us that we should love and serve God. The silent things of eartl are most elo-. quent in vindicati ng the wisdom of our Creator." In this blissatl humor he rcacled Leander Hall, just as the lights were brought into the parlor.

I had really forgntten the pavauro of the thing. In fact, I know hbut little about tle Baptists' usages or creeds, any way.  , You lknow that they are all close communionists,  don't you, Mr. Sumner?" asked Annie, who had hitherto ,  remained silent. "1h, yes, I know they are at grievous fault in that res- pect; (ewcuse me, Miss Weston,) but I suppose they are honest in their convictions. I cannot say that it is igno- rance,- rb:ather a too striqt adherence to tradition. ' "' mnp fitfcr with you there, Mr. sumnier. As to our strictl adh .p to tradition, it is true, but pot to that of u: ninspir: men. We take it as handed to us through the: Apostles. We take the Bible as our only "   fallible guide. We advocate no principle, no doctrine it wihat is taught in it. WeVacknowledge no founder r our Church but Christ our Lord and Saviour, as rati- ing the ministrations of Jolln the Baptist." "You certainly don't intend to say tlat close commnu- on is taulht in the Bible, Miss Weston?" h There is but one communion taulht therein, and that,  withl and of the visible Cllhurch of Christ." "But l'ial almost, or a1 good as says, we must all corm- une, if   do disagrlee on some points.

Thie ,Lt-,t r two bear the same relation to each other as the former."   ,i  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8270-00000012"/> Mr. Sumner'saw the force of the argument, and so did Annie. The grand basis on which he predicated his plea  for mixed communion, was disposed of with such cool avidity, that it vexed him sorely. lIe knew not what reply to make to it. To cha-nge the subject was the only recourse,;resolving in the future to never introduce such sandy argument again. "Oh, wh, Miss Weston, we wont dispute on this any fur- ther to-night; let us have some music from you and Miss Alnie hore, wlich ill be far more agreeable than dis- cussion.,'"le quickly suggested. The request was comllied with. The evening passedl off pleasantly, there being no more references nlade to the point in question. Annie took occasion to inform Mr. Sumner of the ar- rangements that had been made, while he was gone, while Mollie was performing some entertaining piece on the piano.  - What do you think of it," she asked in an under tone. "Of course it is a duty; I must attend to it."  "Don't you think you can settle the matter forever?" "Certainly; the argument on our side is clear and in- vincible," he replied, in great confidence.  "And then, you know, you have the concurrence of all the denominations in the world, nearly," she suggested hopefully. Yes, that is a consideration." Wasn't there a great Baptist man who believed in open-communion?" she asked. "Yes, one of their greatest men, Robert Hall." This little conversation was put an end to, by the ceas- ing of the music.  The next morning Mr. Sumner called on Mr. Bacon, in his study. The matter was there arranged. Mr. West- on should meet Mr. Sumner at Mr. Bacon's house on the following morning, where they could have the use of the extensive library belonging to Leander Hall. "Come early, Bro. Sumner-come out to breakfast," he insisted, as he bade him good-by at the gate; "my library has every work in it that you could possibly need; come and look over the most important theological works." "So will, Bro, Bacon, I thank you."   Mr. Sumner hurried towards his home. There was vork for him to do!-a new field was open-recourse to he accomplishment of his darling project-the putting own forever of a creed, ruinous to the cause of Christi- nity, and fruitful of all the discord and strife in the reli- ious world.  "O Lord, am I to be the humble instrument in this ause?" he would exclaim half aloud to himself, as he ,ended his way home. In his infatuation and zeal, he ,st cognizance of every point except the one in view, the ppurtenacices of which he was entirely oblivious. "(Good morning, Mr. Bacon! Iow are you?" exclaim- 1 preacher Sampson, as a servant ushered him into Mr. aecon's study.  "Well, I thank you; how do you come on? Any news?" "Any news? I should think you have all the news up ere, from what I can learn!" he exclaimed, accepting ie proffered seat.        - "Indeed, we are about to have stirring times up this ay; what do you think of it?" "Oh, I approve the plan. It's what I've wished for  tany years."  "Will you be in attendance?" "Well, now, I tell you, I'd: like to be, but my affairs are arranged that I can't be even in the place."  '"Why, where are you going.?"-  ' Business over in Indiana, sir--the settlement of a de- sased uncle's estate."  "This is unfortunate, Mr. Sampson; can't it be avoid- 1?" "Impossible! impossible!" '"-But what will we do?" "You have Dr. Boon with you.'  "{ Stre enough, sure enough." Mr. Bacon was for adopting the philosopher's theory: ! Seize upon knowledge wherever it is found;" the sanme pplied to help. Hie was willing to be saved by an invet- rate enemy; hence the currency of this conversation. "' ow stands our young preacher on this point?" asked . Ir. Sampson. (It was our now, since they were col-  agued.)  ,' Whom? Bro.

I cautioned him about resus- citating his memory, though, I apprehend no danger. *Can't you stay longer " seeing Mr. Sampson was rising to go. "I would, but I have an engagement. Myi time is out already," 'said he, looking at his watch. "I wish you much success. I hope the thing may be put an end to forever, for nearly all the controversy, and dissimulation (he mistook the meaning of the word), between the reli- gions people of onr day, grow out of that question. I call it a scheme of sanctified hypocrisy! Strong words, these!  "Dear, dear, dear me!" exclaimed Mr. Bacoll, when he was left alone. "Can it survive so many rebuffs? Thlere are so many opposed to it! I really feel sorry for Mr. "Weston, for I' believe he is a good mant at heart, but is enveloped in a mist of error."  "So many opposed to it," numerically, but we must re- member that the Bible weighs more than number. Skep- ticism, with its supernumerary attendants, aided by the world-wars, bloodshed, schisms, monarchism, and the brightest inteliucts in the annals of history-all, all have crumbled in the vortex of fallibility, which Christianity in its rooted soundness withstood. 'Then to quote number as strength,outside of the Bible, is a flaming absurdity- a mis-seem, addicted to policy, and'd calculated to deceive the unsuspecting and fickle class of peoplq It is so often the case with partizans, to philosophize in seemly logic until their subjects are carried captive to their will, when biblical proof is looked for, the structure is found to be a fabrication of grossest inconsistencies. Yet suclr arc the constituents of man.  The morrow Was looked forward to, with grcat anxiety. Mr. Sumner felt confident; Dr. Boon more so.  Mr. Weston was also affected by the mania, but his calcula- tions were not of his own strength. He did not fail to commit the matter into the hands of Him who waatches Iis truth, amidst the flames, and under the chilly pangs of the sword. He knew that God had ever dope it, and would still do it. Ah, yes, in the dark ages, when Truth - was bleeding at every pore, from the thralldom of perse- cution, God did not suffer it to die, but nianumittec it from? its intolerable bondage, and gave his Church, against which - (, X   the gates of hell sho2uld not prevai., liberty; for wLich it panted over sixteen hundred years! Mr. Weston knew  this, (and was reliant. Mrs. Standftord's lparlo r again held a grrolp of ladies. It wast the evenling Ipreceding the cormmencemlent of the investigation. The news had gone out. Nor had it lost anytlhiig. "It is really a shame, Sister Stanford!" exclaimed a lady, wlho had been listenring to lher narrative. "Are you  certain that there is no nistake about it?"' "Yes, just as certain as that I am living." , "Oh, as to doubting it," sp(oke ill the third, S"yOu had as well doubt that the su sn hiiies." "Yes," said another, "for Mr. Sumner told my hus- band so this morillng."  "Well, I think it is a great piece of insolence," chimed in Miss Lankinston, who was also present. "As for my part anld lhare, said Mrs. Stanford, "1 would not listent to his qlibbling'."  "Nor would I," said I, another.  "I am surprised at Mr. Bacon's suffering such a thing  in his house. Come in, Sister Crow. Iland'mne your bonnet. Are you well?" "Quite well, I thank you. Good morning, ladies. I hope I am not intruding."  "Not at all. We were just talking about that 'tight- laced' fellow, which has corm in here to fuss with us." "You have reference to Mr. Weston." "Yes, the same. He has presumed to debate with  Bro. Sumner on the very question, about which, of all others, he should keep silent." "We   wh! wel may he reap his reward! I hope he will be repaid for not inviting. me to te Lord's Supper on last Sabbath. I never wish to be present on suchl another oc- casion, as long as I live. I liave lot telt right since!!" and she began to rock herself violently, alfter she had  vented her anger in a shower of words and gestures. "Oh, well, ladies," spoke in a more senisiblc wonmnl, who had been quiet till then, " let every maii have his own opinion about these things. Mr. Weston las only taken  a coupd'ocl view of the mnatter. I hope Bro. SunIer will  convince him of the fallacy of such unoioIn.. If ho don't,  we'll have to lot him go."

They are proverbial for stubbornness and perverseness. I'd like to know where they ever started, any how." (Perhaps we will give the lady some information on that subject before we are through. However, if we fail, we advise her to read Baptist History, for instance, Or-  chard's History of the Baptists.) The drift of the above conversation shows that the  ultraism of now-a-day, is more the result of ignorance than party spirit, but the latter has its share. Both are  to be deplored. This speaks volumes to each' Baptist.. Are you acquainted with your History? The Metlhodists  are with theirs, for who does not know that John Wesley  set up that -Curch near the middle of the eiyshtecth century?  Some are now living wlo can almost remember its days  of infanlcy!' Campbellites are acquainted with theirs,  for the memory of many now living, takes in its scope, its birth!  Baptists, are you? How often have you traced in mnem- ory, from the crepusculine glimmer of partial History, that class who watered the Alpine valleys witl their blood  for successive ages? Do you ever go back to the days when "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Pre- o pare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straiglt"?  Do you remember the order who sprang from thence? For, "as concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against." (Acts xxviii: 22.) But oh! let not that influence you to turn away from it, but rather let it knit the brethren more closely together in the bonds  of love, and teach them to endure with patience the trials incumbent therein, though they be bufFeting, scorn, per  secution and death; -"for even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps."

"Neither shall they say lo here! or lo there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you."-- Mark i: 1,2; Lukexvii: 21. NE1VER did the sun fling its charming rays on the west- ern hills in more beauty and grace, than it did on the morning appointed for the beginning of-the investigation of-Truth. The radiant skies laughed in almost visible smiles, as the sun-light played iis fancy pencilings on the coarctated masses that lay in graceful folds along the deep concave of heaven. This sub-stratum of heaven's   - arch, stretched its heavy veil over the western crags, as If to screen them from the solstitial heat of mid-sulmmer, and to environ the valley-indented land with its shadowy protection, which added shade to shade, and made the forest to resemble some sequestered glade where the sun could never pierce. The orient folds of amber clouds drifted aside without resistance, when the Sun first stept  upon this theittre of action. The dark brown hue of the Oho, seemed for a moment to yield to a silvery sheeting, bespangled with the horizontal light of his morning glory. All, all was joy as appertains to Nature's smiles. And as a thousand birds "awoke their praise,'? a busy hum start-  ed up, announcing the fact, that the inmates of M - were alive to time's great changes.  Mr. Bacon anxiously awaited Mr. Sumner's arrival for  breakfast, but as he did not come by eight o'clock, he ordered it to be served without delay, hoping in the mean- - time, the expected guest would arrive.   &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8270-00000015"/> -24       LEANDER   HALL. Though a man of indomitable principles, the delay ot Mr. Sumner frustrated him considerably, in somuch that the hot rolls remained on his plate untasted, and the steaming coffee, barely sipped. Every thing was arranged in Mr. Bacon's mind, as to how the coming discussion should be conducted. lie would not spare Mr. Weston, for he had no right to pro. paugate such unwhollesome doctrine. He had even imagin- ed tihe style in which the investigation should terminate. Iis fruitful reverie had pictured a very ini[,rsing para- Iphernalia in which his cause was to remain clothed, while on-the other hand, lie saw Mr. Weston uprooted, defeated -and without pity! Wh y!" lie would exclaim, as he walked his study, looking anxiously for Mr. Sumner, "the very nature of the CIhristian cries out against such a polisy!" (They would have it policy instead of principle.)"What.?"-monopolize that iinstitution, which before all others should lnite Christians?! Why should we be exhorted to unity of sspirit and brotlherly love, if we cannot partake together of the Lord's Supper?"  (He folrgt that Paul was speaking to one Church.)           ? So-sanguine was our friend, that he allowed no shadow of doubt to come athwart the sunshine of his reflections.-- Had he suffered a whisper from Future's reader to inter- cept hs pleasant strain, his response no doubt would have been like the philosopher to Alexander the Great,- "Keep out of ny sunshile." In such wild dreams, lie drew up a conipendium thus:- "Mr. Sumner was invincible- "Tile subject so clearly elucidated by the Bible- "The groundless position of the opponent, and- "The world at large believed in open comrmunion." And thus did he entertain himself, until the arrival of  Dr. Boon, which put an end to his pleasant reflections. 'A fine morning, Mr, Bacon. I hdpJe it portends good to us." "Yes quite pleasant indeed. Did you see anything oi JBro. Slmlner down in town?" he asked quickly, belore his guest was seated. ' No; $ waited for him, but he did not come by.

Annie stood ready to receive them. She conducted Mr. Weston- into the study, and Mollie to her room, to  take her bonnet, and readjust the recreant curls that had yielded to the breezes on the way. "Has Mr. Sumner arrived?" was the first question. "N o; we are looking for him."' "Why, it is late; papa told,me to hurry or you would be waiting." "I know it is time that he had come, but the days are long, o we will have plenty of time. Come; let us go down and see what they are doing," said Annie, stealing her arm affectionately around her companion's waist.  They descended to the library, where Mr. Bacon had taken his guest. Mr. Sumner came not.  What could be the matter? was the general inquiry; whereupon Mr. Bacon sent a servant to learn the cause of his non-appearance. He walked the floor impatiently, watching the front avenue, and the servant's entry gate. A cloud passed over his countenance. "There must be something the matter," suggested Dr.  -  Boon, perceiving the old man's restlessness." "I hope he is only delayed by some trivial circumstance. He will be in directly. It may ndt be as late as we think,"  said Mr. Weston, looking at his watch.  "No; there is something the matter!" exclaimedMr. Bacon; his face coloring withagitation. "Yonder is tlih  servant .coming without him! Go, Dr. Boon, and see what is the matter. The boy has a note," said Mr. Bacon, his excitement not at all palliated by the arrival of the servant.-  The note was handed to the Doctor. He read-      - "GENTLBMEN.:  "Dea Sirs8:--It-is impossible for me to be present to-day, on aecount of-illness. .

During the suspense, Annie's heart felt a most painful sentation, but she was silent. She was fearful that some serious accident had happened. Perhaps he was suffering in his room, unable to make it knownl! Such were her conjectures when the note was received, which served to dispel her apprehensions .  "What shall we do, gentlemen?" said Mr. Weston, after Mr. Bacon had recovered from his disappointment. "Proceed with the investigation," replied Mr. Bacon. "That is my wish; though you know I am a nominal voter," said Mollie Weston. "You shall have the right of suffrage in this, Miss Weston," said Dr. Boon. "Oh yes, let the ladies have a say-so. And, Miss Bacon, I wish you to point out every objectionable thing I say; also, let me know when you agree with me," said Mr. Weston, turning to Annie. "I thank you, Mr. Weston, I would be gratified to have you agree with us in every thing." "Which, you know, I cannot, though I hope to gain your concurrence in many things that you now repudiate." "Not in close communion, surely." "Yes, Miss Bacon, I think you will finally admit that close communion is a consistent doctrine." "No, no," said Annie, shaking her head, "I am firm in my belief, I cannot think that close communion is the result of any thing but selfishness." "You are very hard on us, Miss Bacon, though I hope ,to mitigate silch obdurate feelings." "Never, never, Mr. Weston. It is a part of my nature to be liberal." "Perhaps it is with things that belong to you, but I will convince you, I hope, that the Lord's Supper does not belong to you, and that you have no right to cele. brate it."  "Mr. Weston!" "Yes, Miss Bacon, you will make that concession be- fore we are through." "Never, never, I tell you. You are the people that claim the Lord's Supper as your prerogative only." "No, Miss Bacon, we only contend that it )longs to the Church of Christ, and none but that Church has a right- to celebrate it."   THB INVESTIGATION.       27 "Well, woe think it belongs to the Church too, but you know there are branches of the Church." "Perhaps you may find yourself mistaken as we ad- vance. You do not believe that God set up the Metho- dist Church do youup the Metho No, not by himself, but he used instruments, such as Wesley, Whitefield, Coke, Asbury, and others." "Nevermind about that,"interrupted Mr Bacon. "Dr. Boon here, is a strong advocate of the right principle, he must take up the gauntlet, you know I am no theologian." "Nor am!" said Mr. Weston, ( but I know the truth as taught in this blessed book, (the Bible,) and I feel constrained to advocate it while civil liberty is granted Hie." "But you do not mean to say that close communion is tauht by precept or example in' the Bible, do yo?" ". do most emphatically, was the frm response. Then said Dr. Boon, "prove what you assert." "I will, in m'humble way; but the investigation must proceed with system." 'Oh well, any way you please; but I predict that you will find it an up-hill business." Mr. .Weston" began:--  "As we have agreed to this investigation, I hope no  unpleasant feelings may ensue. You are aware that our  sentiments on religion are liable to attacks irrespective of personal feelings--that man's character may be unimu- peached, while his opinions are'subjected to public criti- cism--to the rebuffs and assaults of all classes. I hope this consideration may serve as a safeguard against any outhurst of angel; which is natural in such cases. Dr. Boon, you have asked me to prove that close communion is orthodox; now, I would ask you, if you consider com- munion a New Testament ordinance?" "I do, most assuredly sir," replied Dr. Boon, readily. "And so do I," put in Mr. Bacon. "Furthermore, I believe it is a Christian ordinance; that is, every Christi ^.- A has a right to commune, regardless of external ordinari.: ces.

LEANDER HALL. "But we know they are not Christians." "Yet, according to your theory, we have no right to judge. But this is not to the point. You both admit that the iord's Supper is a New Testament ordinance?" They bowed in assent. "And also a Church ordinance?" Of course," they replied simultaneously. Then, my friends," he continued, "if it is a Church ordinance,let us find where that Church began; that is, at what period in sacred history a visible Church was established in which this Institution was first recognized. "That can be easily done," said Dr. Boon. "We all know that the first visible Church we. have any notice of, was on the day of Pentecost."  There you affirm, Dr. Boon, and it behooves you to prove your position." "That I can do easily. There could be no Church un- til after the resurrection. The scherie of salvation until then was incomplete-baptismi before that period was not valid, or the same in significence as that adminilstered afterwards." ".But how do you make that, Doctor? What scriptural proof have you for such an assertion?" "Why, John's Baptism was only the baptism of repen- tance, administered according to a command; but after Christ's resurrection, as many 'as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death.' Of this im- portant fact, John was wholly ignorant. The apostle con- tinues in this significant language, Therefoe, we are buried with him by baptism into death, that, like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walkin newness of life. Did John teach this? Most positively he did not. Now, it the bap- tism before the death and resurrection of Christ is not Christian, then there could be no Church, for baptism is undeniably admitted by all denominations, as the in-  itiatory act into the Church, or a separating ordinance from the world. 'For,' says Paul, 'as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. We have no notice of a visible Church until the Pentecostal day. There could be no Church until after the plan of salvati6n was complete, and the great Commission given. It was Christ's mission here on earth to set up a    AL J, . a J. .A - - D V A1 * 41 Church, that is, the principles;-one element was his death, another his burial, another his resurrection, and then comes baptism, as a figure embracing the whole. John's baptism was only a manifesto of mode, and a substitute for Christian baptism, submitted to by Christ merely for the adoption of the mode!" Mr. Bacon, though differing with Dr. Boon, thought the argument good, and did not forbear to manifest it. His only wish was to see Mr. Weston's "plan defeated," as he termed it. Not that he had any confidence in the Campbellite doctrine, but the dogma, close communion, was a target he wished despoiled forever. The Campbell- ites, as a Christian people, were wanting in Mr. Bacon's estimation. He saw them without a toundation, but like the Jewish historian, he was willing to receive help from the hands of his enemy, rather than death. It was for the forwarding of his plans, not the unsophisticated prin- ciples of truth, that he was laboring. Mr. Sumner's in- ability of being present was a great source of disappoint- ment, but after all, he began to think he had some reasons for congratulating himself upon securing such a champion in the defence of his position, in the person of Dr. Boon. As Mr. Weston did not interrupt him, Dr. Boon con- tinued. "We mnst conclude that John, the Harbinger, was a prophet of the Israelitish dispensation-belonging to the Mosaic or Jewish, not the Christian dispensation.. His mission was a preparation for the Christian dispensation, not the beginning, for Christ was not yet sacrificed for the sins of the world, consequently the offerings of sacri- ficial blood was yet in uqe. As evidence of my posi-  tion, I cite the disciples whom Paul found atEphesus; The defect in their baptism must inevitably prove that John's baptism was no dividing mark between the world  and the Church, for when they told the nature of their  baptism, Paul took them and baptized them in the name of the crucified and risen Saviour." He paused a moment, for he had taken bold grounds. and quite a dangerous stand. "Now sir," he continued, "the whole epitome is, that the commission embraced the unly true and Christian baptism ever administered as an initiatory rite into the   &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8270-00000018"/> 80        LEANDER   HALL. Church of God, consequently, prior to that, no Church existed, for there was no dividing line between the Church and world, until this lustration as given by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, 'for the remission of sins.'" There was a long pause. Mr. Bacon changed his posi- tion in his chair, in his satisfaction; not that he endorsed the doetrine advanced, but he saw that a way was being opened for Mr. Weston's defeat and discomfiture; this was the source of his elation. Dr. Boon was well satisfied with his "elucidation" of the subject, as he thought, and felt confident that his argument was irrefragable. "But," said he, "I [cnnot for my life see, Mr. Weston, what relevancy there is o the question of close commun- ion, in establishing the-Church at any definite time in sacred history." "Let the plan develope itself, Doctor," replied Mr. Weston. "This is a point of dispute between us any way, so there can be no loss in settling it now." Certainly not. There is only a shadow of difference between the Baptists and the Reformers, any how, and this has grown out of a misunderstanding, which I prophesy will be cleared away in time to come.* Only your schism, close communion." "But to -the investigation," interrupted Mr. Weston. First let me take you where you started. You affirmed that there could be no Church until after the resurrection, as the scheme of salvation, until theh, was incomplete. I say there was a Church, or why did Christ say: 'And if he (the offender) shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the'Church? This was said before thl!e Pentecostal feast, and was a command to be obeyed forthwith.'"- "The first allusion to the 'Church,' was in the conver- '"ation between our Lord and Peter. It reads thus: 'Thou art Peter, (that is a stone,) and upon this rock, I will' build MY ChuRcH, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.' This is the first instance of its being termed 'Church,' though long-before this, John, the harbinger, proclaimed that the 'kingdom of heaven was at hand,' the This language was uttered in our presence once, by a Baptist: We re- marked, that he did not comprehend the depth of that shadow, or he would not thus speak. We are fearful that he was too deep in the "naturalman," to perceive the things of the Spirit.   THE  INVESTIGATION.        81 term being synonyiious with the kingdom of God, which means, the Church  of God. Christ calls this 'MY CHURCH,' and declares himself the builder, that is, no part of the structure is unauthorized by himself. For further light on this pait, turn to Eph. i: 22,23." Mr. Bacon took the Testament and found the place lesignated, and handed it to Mr. Weston, who read as follows : "'And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.' Here he is described as the head of the Church, it being the body. Paul again- says: 'For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church.' Now it i., evident that the Church could not exist visibly without the head; on the other hand, if the Church did not exist- during Christ's incarnation, then the head existed-without the body! Sir, I leave this point, which takes, in one scope, the refutation of your whole argument; but for your satisfaction, I will go with you through, though if I have proven the Church to have existed before the day of Pentecost, that event tears down your fabrication at one swoop. Yet I will proceed tothe next point." Dr. Boon ran his fingers through his hair, with an air of discomfiture, for he saw that Mr. Weston had, without the plastic hand of polite literature, torn down his imagin- - ary wall of defence, at one blow. Mr. Bacon changed his position in his cliair, but not in satisfaction, for he felt that a blow was aimed at him, (he being an advocate of identity of Churches with the Old and New dispensations,) but he was not prepared to con- tend, so he forebore-this discretion being the better part of valor, he thought. "You say," continued Mr. Weston, "'that John's bap- tism was only a baptism of repentance, administered accord-  ing to a command; but, after Christ's resurrection, as many as  were baptized unto Jesus Christ, were baptized unto his death.' Well, I ask you if the baptism administered after Christ's ascension, was not the baptism of repentance? Peter said on the day of Pentecost, REPENT and be baptized,' etc. Both baptisms (as you make them plural by speak- ing of them as two, so will I), were of repentance; both of faith in the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, If the "*.                 ,  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8270-00000019"/> 82        LEANDEB   H ALL. formula used when administering, were different, that cannot change essentially the orthodoxy, or validity of John's baptism; if so, Abraham's faith in the Messiah, is no model of the faith taught in the Bible. (See Rom. iv.) Nor could his faith be the same essentially, as those 'that believe now-a-day. A multiplicity of facts cannot change the nature of belief. "If you make a difference in the baptism administered before, and that after the death of Christ, you must make a difterence in the Lord's Supper partaken of before his death and that after! for the significancy of both, (that is, baptism and the Supper,) pertains to his death. If you will have two baptisms, you must have two Lord's Suppers! -I would ask, can anything come from Divine revelation that is not valid? God had as much right to command, as Christ to commission. John was sent by a special command of God-so says Luke (ix: 28) and John (v: 33.) His mission was to prepare a people:for Christ. How? A visible collection from the world, for Christ calls them BRETHREN, in several places. John was to pre- pare a people that would receive him, and believe in him, as those after his death." All saw the force of the argument, but no one felt wil- ling to join issue with Mr. Weston. He continued: The next point in question is, ' John the Harbinger was a prophet of the Israelitish, dispensation-belonging- to the Mosaic, or Jewish, and not Christian dispensation. His mission was, a preparation for the Christian dispensation, not the beginning,for Christ was not yet sacrificed for the sins of 'the world; consequently, the offering of sacrificial blood was yet in use.' I think it is a pity to spoil such a beautiful superstructure as this, which you have reared." "You cannot deny, sir, that John belonged to the Is- raelitish dispensation." "By descent he did, but not deputation. His ministry was the 'beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,the Son of God.' In proof of this, allow me to read from Mark-' The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of .God; as it is written in'the prophets,behold 1 send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,. make :his paths straight. John did baptize in the wilderness, and +  .               . .   THE INVESTIGATION.        33 preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of ins.' Now here is the beginning of the Gospel, and the establishment of the visible Church; if not, the head existed without the body! The beginning of a thing is a part of itself, The year eighteen hundred and sixty began on New-year's day. That day, in chronology, will-be computed as part of that year. But let us see how Mat- thew reads: 'And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force; for all the prophets and the law were until John! How could the kingdom of heaven suffer violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law were until John. How  could the kingdom of heaven suffer violence before it ex- isted? then it existed from the days of John! the term 'kingdom of heaven,' being used to distinguish it from the kingdoms of this world." A pause of some moments ensued, but Mr. Weston  soon proceeded! "A question arises here, what is meant by the phrase 'from the days of: John ' To explain, suffer me to read passages that will throw some light on the subject.  ^ "'4:Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffer- d  ed you to lput away your wives; butfrom the beginning it was not so.' ' From the beginning,' here evidently means the beginning. "'Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.' This is so plain and simple, that no one can fail to see what the apostle meant-that Jesus knew from the first, who should betray him. ;If from the beginning includes the beginning,from the  days of John,includes the days of John; sqhere the gos-  pel, we are told even by Christ, began, then of course must the: Church, or the head existed without the body.  '"Again allow me to read:-  ": A1ll the;prophets and the law prophesied until John.' Now here is the termination of the Israelitish dispensa- tion; from that began the gospel, for Luke says, The law and the prophets were until John, since that time  the kingdom; of God is preached, and every man presseth  into it.' Who first preached the kingdom of heaven?  Let us see. 'In those days came John the Baptist, preach- ing in the wilderness of Judea. And saying, Repent ye:  ; .  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8270-00000020"/> 34       LEANDAU HALL. for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' (The kingdom of God and kingdom af heaven are synonymouo terms.") "But Mr. Weston, what do you do with the case of the disciples at'Ephesus?-they were twice baptized. First by John's baptism, and then of Christ's. Now, I don't believe you can clear that away so easily," said Dr. Boon, 'who was becoming somewhat used to being defeated., Mr. Bacon also hoped this was an obstacle, and gave Mr' Weston a look to that, effect, but the latter seemed nothing daunted. He soon proceeded. , *"I intended to notice that point in due time, and as it comes next, and last, I will take it up now. Some con- tend, from the grammar of the sentence, beginning, 'Then said Paul,' etc., that they were not baptized, but I have come tothe conclusion that they were. " "Then you invalidate John's baptism." "Not at all. Allow me to proceed. If they were bap- tized, Iask by whom? It could not have been John, for it was the fifty-eighth year of our Lord, and John had been martyred about thirty years, (see a chronological table.) It is not probable, nor hardly possible, for them to have lived through this great period, so near the great theatre of such important events, to-wit: the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and never 'heard whether there be any Holy Ghost!', Paul was at Ephesus about a year before that, on his way from Corinth to Je- rusalem. He brought to Ephesus, Priscilla and Aquila, and left them there. "We have no account of these disciples coming from any other place, therefore we must conclude that they were then young converts, or Paul would havedetected them while passing through Ephesus, for we are told that he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews. Indeed, the manner in which he questioned them corroborates this view, for he asks them,' Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? Now, in no instance did any length of time intervene between belief and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.  "Another thing that gives strength to this view is, if they had been baptized by John, then all the rest of the disciples should have submitted to a repetition of this ordinance.  "Then by whom were they baptized? We are not lef  .       .   THE INVESTIGATIN.        35. here to conjecture, for by reading the 18th chapter we can gain some light: 'And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus--(this was after Paul had' been there the first time and left.) This man was in- structed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, lie spoke and taught diligently the tlings of the Lord, knowing only the: baptism of John. And lhe began to speak boldly in the synagogue, (prior to this his teachings must have been in private,) whom, when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, (it seems that they were the only church members there,) they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.' In his teachings previous to entering the syn- agogue, he must have made some converts, for 'he taught diligently.' "'And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Cor- inth, (he left Ephesus, it appears, immediately, and the brethren wrote letters of recommendation to the brethren of Achaia, 'exhorting the disciples to receive him') Paul, having passed through the upper coast, came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples,' etc. (Chap. xix. 1.) "Here we have the connection of circumstances so clearly laid down that there can scarcely be any doubt entertained as to who baptized them.  "Paul found no such disciples in his first visit to Ephe- Sus, but after ]is departure Apollos came, and 'taught diligently, knowing only the baptism of John'-in private we muslt cotnclude, since when he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue, Aquila and Priscilla 'took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of the Lord more perfectly." "When Apollos passes on to Corinth, Paul comes and  finds these disciples. "Now from these circumstances we all must conclude that Apollos baptized them. But some of you will ask, why was it not as valid for Apollos to baptize them as John? I answer, because at that period Christ had come,  had been made nlanifest, had died, risen, and amcended. John's baptism was into the faith of his coming, which was as valid when administered under the circumstances that-he baptized, as was the baptism Paul administered unto the twelve. John first required two things-that  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8270-00000021"/> S6       LEAN-DEK HALL. they bring forth fruits meet for repentance-that they ' believe on him who should come after him. Now, every one that was baptized by John, to all appearances, was truly penitent, and embraced the Messiah as soon as he was pointed out to him, as did Andrew, and John, and Peter, and others, who carried out the stipulations of their baptism, and had no need of being re-baptized. "It was well enough for John, or any of his disciples. to baptize with the-baptism of repentance, requiring the people to believe on him that should come; but after Christ had come, and John had said, 'Behold the Lamb of God ' ' This is he of whom I spake ;' and after he had re- corded his testimony and retired; and after Christ had prosecuted his work on earth, and suffered and died for the sin of the world, arose from the dead, and ascended, then for any one to baptize in the faith of his coming. would be to ignore the testimony of all that had passed during thirty years that had elapsed. In fact, the gross inconsistency of such a thing precludes the necessity of further remarks on thesubject; only let us look into the grammar, that so many have taken refuge under. "There is a rule in grammar requiring that the noun next to the pronoun, be taken for its antecedent, unless the context forbids. Now the noun 'people' answers to the antecedent, in case the context don't forbid. Let us see: I Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the bap- tism of repentance, sayingsunto the people, that they (the people) should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they (the people) heard this, they (the people) were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul laid his hands on them, (the people).' Here the context forbids, for Paul did not lay his hands on the people, but on the disciples, so the noun 'people' cannot be taken for the antecedent of the pro- noun 'they.' But let us try it with the noun disciples,' which comes as a matter of course, if the noun 'people' , cannot serve as antecedent. 'Then said Paul (to these disciples), John verily baptized with the baptism of re- pentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they (the disciples) heard this, they (the disciples) were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul laid his hands on them, (the disciples,) the Holy Ghost came on them.'    THEiINVESTIGATION. ,        37 '"Then the grammar is with me., "In concluding that they were re-baptized, we dono  violence, to truth, for this; example will not admit of ob- jection. There are yet a few items that I might adduce in the establiehment of this view-that John did not bap- time these disciples. "1st. John told of the Ioly Ghost; they knew noth- ing of it. (Matt. iii: 11; ark i: 8; Luke iii: 16; John t: 33.) Why so ignorant,? They certainly never heard John preach. "2d. 'Unto what theln were eyou baptized?' Their answer was, 'Unto John's li)ttisnm,' that into its require- ments, or into its belief. 'Ieilee thd Apostle Paul says, 'John verily baptized witl -tlch baptism of repentance, saying to the people that thev tilhmld believe on him who should come after him." Of course the Apostle instructed' them, beginning, with the Gospel as preached by John, up to Christ's ascension, so their being baptized again only canceled their obligation of believing on the Saviour to come.  "Bilt this, Doctor, affords no grounds for the belief that John's and Christian baptism are not the same; it only shows that a moral fitness is requisite, and so in John's baptism. This requisition consists in a proper conception of the great truths of the Gospel, and proper reception Of them; hence, when there is a defect in the subject, it in- validates the baptism, such as infant baptism, seeker's baptism, and baptism for the remission of sins, neither can serve the purpose of this sacred ordinance." Dr. Boon slightly cleared his throat. Mr. Weston continued. "A few more sentences, and I shall close, having proven the validity of John's baptism from the sacred Scriptures, and not from reason. If any of you are not satisfied, speak, and I will take you farther in the investigation." He paused for some time, but no one demurred, so he resumed:  "From gur discussion and investigation, we find the va- lidity of John's baptism established, which founds the Church with his preaching, and the ratification of which, by Christ's submitting to his ministrations. If there still  be any doubt entertained on this, I can yet produce more  evidence. Please turn to the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke.

J  "Neither shall they say, lo here'! or lo there! for be- hold, the kifigdom of God is within you.' "Well, I declare," said Dr. Boon, after a moment's thought, ' I never saw that passage before." "Preacher Sampson never quoted it, does he?" asked Mr. Weston, provokingly. "No, not that I remember." "No wonder. Men always forget to make a citation of any text that goes against them. Now for the appli- cation of that passage. "' 1. The Church certainly existed before Pentecost, or how could the kingdom of God (the Church) be in exist- ence previouslytothatperiod,as spoken of by Christ? "2. The baptism of John is repeatedly referred to as being 'from heaven.' (Mark xi: 30; see corresponding references by other Evangelists.) "3. Paul refers to the. brethren previously toPentecosty as being the constituents of the Church. 'After that, he Was:seen of above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain u'ito this present, but some are fallen asleep.' (1 Cor. xv: 6.) "If there were five hundred brethren, and they were called brethren prior to Pentecost, they must have consti- tuted;sorhe sort of a society, which is clearly identified with the Church after Pentecost, as Paul: terms them ibrethren.' Are you satisfied with my explanation?" "AS to me, it does not matter when or where the Church began, but I know that close communion was not practiced in it," said Dr. Bool. "We will attend to that in time, Doctor. I am for convincing you all, that the Church was established when the Light of Zion came, which was in the days of John the Baptist. If any disagree with me further, just let me know."' It is very plain to me, Mr. Weston," said Annie Ba- con. "I have heard Mr. Sampson several times on that yery point, but I noticed that he did not bring up any Scriptural proof.- Yet it cannot be a matter of much im- portance any way, can it?"

Now let us look at the assailed point under consideration, which is 'close communion.'  "But it is nearly twelve o'clock, Mr. Weston. I move that the investigation be suspended for the day, as Bro. Sumner is absent," interrupted Mr. Bacon; who was not at all delighted with the result. "Certainly, certainly, gentlemen-any way you choose to have it," he replied graciously. Mr. Weston soon took his hat and left. Mollie re- mained with Annie, which, when Dr. Boon found out, he willingly accepted Mr. Bacon's invitation to remain also. The young physician was not as well pleased with the finale of the morning's exercise as he anticipated. Mr. Sampson had preached the doctrine which he embraced,   until his hearers had been forced to believe that it was true, whether so or not. He (Mr. Sampson) had occupied a wide field, having no opponent--as the Methodists and Reformers agreed in 'open communion. He knew that his audience would never take the trouble to investigate  hi opinions, so his latitude was bounded only by his in- clinations. Dr. Boon had been his attentive listener from "'time to time, hearing only one side of the question, there- fore his faith in their religion was strong.  But when he heard something from the other side which he could not refute, he was not easy about the matter, though he wore an external appearance ofinidif- ference. Dr. Boon was honest in his opinions, but (u this occasion, the transition from his former views, was so sudden and unexpected, that he hardly could make a self-acknowledgment, much less to another.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8270-00000023"/> CHAPTER     IIi.

The evening was before our trio, to choose any entertainment which their tastes might suggest. Evenings in July are long, and sometimes tedious; in consideration of which, Annie began -to de- vise plans of pastime immediately after they entered the parlor from the dining room. As a hostess, she felt it her duty to frame measures of entertainment; but the weath- er being warm and sultry, it was quite difficult to light on tny feasible employment. "Shall we spend the evening in boat riding?-which by- the-way, will be very warm-or shall wedive in tne dusty tomes of commentaries?-or Carson on baptism? To lay aside all moral ethics, shall we hunt up the far-famed Blackstone-and regale ourselves on his chaste solidity?' or further, suppose we hunt up the book which treats of Olympic Games, and read their rubric citations, and antic pleadings on the rostrums before their altars? Speak quick- ly; how do you propose spending the evening?" she asked, seating herself on a comfortably cushioned chair. "Really Miss Annie," responded Dr. Boon, "there are so many alternatives, that one can hardly decide." ")Then some one propose something that will not admit of an alternative, for I have exhausted my catalogue in the fruitless effort." j "Not fruitless at all," interrupted Mollie Weston. "You have made the very propositions most desired; I second the suggestionof ' books,' the character just mentioned, or any other which the company admires."

"Very little; which is doubly compensated by the em- ploymentof your time at other things more,useful. Now I am a strong advocate of reading a great deal, but let that reading be a selection worth storing the mind with, or you gather nothing but dross at the expense of time." "Those are my sentiments, too," said Annie, who had remained a listener for some time. "But, Miss Annie, I am told that you often burn the 'midnight oil;' now do you confine yourself to solid feasts, to the exclusion of light literature?"          i "I do not burn the 'midnight oil, Doctor, and, more-  over, I deem it a culpable error, which has elicited more ! notice than due. Morning is the proper time to study." ' "That is what I think," said Mollie; " my reading is somewhat restricted, I acknowledge, but what I do read or study,I find it is better attended to when my mind has not been oppressed to fatigue with the cares of the day." "I believe you Baptists are restricted in everything," Dr. Boon laughingly said,/as he moved his chair nearer a table of books.  "Perhaps, Doctor, not as restricted as one might sup- pose. I don't know anything about the fashionable nov- els of the day, which our city belles make so many demon- strations over, and of which a thorough acquaintance is essential to what is termed 'an accomplished lady;' but my ignorance in that respect I can hardly think is to be censured. As I do not belong to the fashionable world, an education in that line is not needed. The trash that ainually emerges from New York and other large cities is enough to pervert a nation. The French style of writing has truly obscured our literary world with a mist of fiction. There is hardly an author or authoress now-a- day's but deals in fiction, to the exdusioaWi f all truth, sci-  eace, or solid writing.

The French --to them are we in- debted for the perversion of so many young and suscep- tible minds. If I cannot be fashionable without reading such, let me dwell in the unpretending world," responded Mollie, warmly.        , "Your sentiments are good, Miss Weston, and I fully indorse them"- Hero the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a servant for a physician. "Who wants me?-where must I go?" asked Dr. Boon, who could gain but little information from the agitated boy. "Mrs. Kent is dyinig, and her son tole me to run over here arter you, beings yofi might do something for her," replied the boy, frightened half out of his wits. "Who is Mrs. Kent?" asked Mollie. "She is a poor woman, living down on the bank of the river, nevertheless, she is a very intelligent woman. She has a son living with her." "' Hadn't we better go, too?" suggested Annie. "The very thing, Miss Annie; she may be alone and dying," replied the Doctor.  He emphasized the word dying, as if horrible beyond conception. Indeed, it is a period to which we all look as solemn arid melancholy; but the Christian does not shudder at the thon;lght of finding eternal rest; if so, then "Christ is delad ii vain "-his resurrection of no  avail. Annie called her so, .;, girl to go with them, in the event of her assistance being needed. The party hurried to the little domicil of Mrs. Kent, but when they arrived there, true to what the boy who had summoned them said, she was struggling in the arms of death! - Dr. Boon soon saw that it was futile to administer any- thing but some strengthening cordial. By request, the patient was raised up and props sta- tioned at her back. She began to talkin a falteringvoice, scarcely audible. "I am dying; I know it, and feel it, but I cannot say with many regrets. This life with me has been attended with man:y trying vicissitudes. I've seen my last friend on earth,-except my darling boy, close his eyes in death.   A DEATH-BED SCENE.         43 This served to wreck me, and at ftimes I have felt like rebelling against God's will; but lie hath chosen these trials to purify rny nature of some of its dloss, for out of deep afflictions came perfect resignation to his divine appointments; and now I feel that God has dealt better with me than I have merited. "Oh! when my little angel daughter was taken5, I almost felt like cursing God; but, thanks to his mercy, he has given me strength to bear up amidst afflictions lar deeper, and I have been led by his holy influence to the feet of Jesus. Yes, God has forgiven my crime of sare revolt at his will, and to-day, while- submitting to the ravages of death, my only ' re is consequent on leav- ing my darling boy alone, unprotected, uncared and un- provided for. Yet, in this trouble there is a consolation. God is watching with an all-speing eye over his fate. Hee who feeds the little ravens will not suffer my boy to needor to fall into temptations beyond his strength. I grieve for him, because he will borrow for nme. It is but natural that he should feel the deepest pangs of bereave- ment at the loss of' a mother, his only parent; and oh! if"-and here the sufferer ceased for a moment, to gather strength. Another potiol of cordial was administered, which had its effect, and she resumed: "When I am (goe, there will be no church bell to toll the knell of my departure, for I have never identified myself with any of God's people. I might have done this, but no opportunity offered itself, so it has been neg- lected. I ha^e never been baptized; ,but that does not disrobe me of the prospect of entering that rest which is  held in reservation Ior those that die in the Lord.

When I am gone"-her voice failed her again. In a moment she had passed from this life. Annie dispatched her servant for some of the near neighbors.  The orphan boy stood by the bed-side until he saw the loved object breathe no longer; then, in the depths of his  grief, he sought some quiet place of solitude, to pour out  his heart to God in prayer, an-event which spoke well of  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8270-00000025"/> "       L E 1 A i J. the-mother's teachings.

The scene had had its effect. lie walked homeward in adeep melancholy mood. Molhe was' the first to break the silence. tIt is a blessed consolation to see the dying trust in the Lord. Oh! what a dreadful scene it would have been, had not the poor creature which we have just left been preparedt for death  cnot see, Miss  eston, how  e old have been so resigned. D eath is suh an awful thing to contem- plate, and so mucah Worse to realize," responued Dr. Boon, in a tone of surprise. "Death is indeed awful to those that cannot see the merits of the blood of Christ, but to the Christian it has no sting,' replied Mollie. They walked on inr silence again for a few moments, and then Dr. Boon interrupted: ", Ter boy (that is, Mrs. Kent's boy)-there must some- thing be done for him." "Yes, he is a noble-looking youth, and oh! he looked like .he loved his mother so much. "I will attend to tht," said he, half to himself, as they walked into Mr. Bacon's parlor. After seeing the ladies home, Dr. Boon was too much exercised by sad feelings to entertain them further, so he excused himself, thinking that that day, of all 6thers, had been fruitful of much food for the mind. Let us look into his thoughts after he finds himself alonie. "Well, thanks to kind fortune, I am here in my little office once more and secure from any more unpleasant Ievents. What has happened to-day? Everything! I have been drifted by every opposing wind, and now I have the consolation of knowing that my bark is on a r sand bar,' or I am laboring, under a hallucination of the   brain. But pshaw! it's all stuff! Let me try the virtue of a good Havana." So saying, he sprang to his feet, as  if to elude, by physical action, the unpleasant thought that was clinging to him,  As the smoke from his cigarette curled; around his head, he looked up and began to think again: "Somebody is wrong, but Hhope it is not me. I think I am right; yet Jit is possible that I am at fault-but pshaw! it's all a: farce-mental illusions; they go hand in hand. The day, how has it gone, and where has it gone? Who has been the loser and who the gainer? I have been the latter, apparently. Pshaw! pshaw! there it is again. A notion, if fed right, will turn out to be a mountain of facts from a mole-hill of fiction. ' Feed the flame with fuel, if you wish hot coals.' Let me profit by this maxim. So here goes all skepticism, illusions, and spectres of the brain." And he tossed his nearly-spent cigar in the grate, and took a book for pastime. lie tried to read, but in spiteof his efforts and resolur  tions, his mind would revert to the scene in the little log cabin. It seemed that it was laid down on every page of the book which he was' reading, and a dirk word now and then glided before his eyes, a reflection written death! That brow, with its resignation beaming through the devs of death; that smile, through the dreadful accom- panying sufferings; all loomed up to his mental view, and he lost sight of the literal pages before him. "It is all foolishness," he exclaimed, half aloud. "I'll sit here no longer a prey to such aberrations, strung to the greatest acme of the fruitful imagination."  He got up and left his -office and sought the street, where a group of men were congregated. Perceiving that preacher Sampson was main speaker, he' forgot his melancholy thoughts for a monlent, and drew near to get a benefit. When the preacher saw him he ceased his  oration, to talk with him.  "Why! how are you, Doctor? What's the news over  at the Hall? I'd have been there to-day, but was not certain but what I'd get off. Sumner gave- it to him- c!? Certainly, certainly, it could not have been other-  "Mr. Sumlner was not there, as ill fortune would have ;.   is ill, qu ite so, I s: ppose, but thinks he'll -be in ttteudanuce to-irl orow ." .  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8270-00000026"/>        1 tJi Jt &amp;U Ui J it A JJ . To be sure! Well, it is a pity I have to go away; if not, that man Weston's principles wouldn't survive him! But you havn't told me how you came out. Of course you lashed him well for his selfishness." "He did not give me a chance. The fact is, heis going to have his own way iii this matter." This caused a slight cloud to pass over preacher Samp- son's face, but seeing that there was a Baptist present, he knew it would not do to-manifest any discomfiture, so he rallied by saying:  "Oh, well, that's the way with the whole sect. They will have their way, and think no one has a right to believe any other but theirs. 'A bad beginning makes a good ending,"' he concluded, inu an under tone, taking Dr. Boon's arm and leading him off from the crowd. Dr. Boon related the particulars of the discussion, and asked the preacher if there were no further argument to sustain that point-the establishment of the Church on. Pentecost. "Well, did he refute the argument you brought up?" "He did most conclusively, I am sorry to say. "Oh, well, that has no relevancy to the main point, so it won'tmake much difference, only don't say anything about it. If you and Mr. Sumner can succeed in convin- cing him of the sinfulness of close communion, that will satisfy M--.  The excitement all comes from that source. Now be particular that you don't say anything about to-day's exercise, for he won't tell it, so it need not get out." Dr. Boon thought it good advice, at least practicable for the present, but he did not relish the fact of his Church advocating a groundless position. However, he silenced his conscience, as there was no other apparent alternative.  The next step he took, was to go down and see Mr. Sumner. He found him sitting up, but looking quite feeble. "Come in,'Doctor; you are the very one whom I want to see. I suppose you conducted the investigation to your satisfaction to-day?" "Not exactly so, Mr. Sumner. I had some little trou- ble. Mr. Weston exceeded my anticipation, be replied, honestly.   -  D iis-5 bI; S^AfCENE.    47     'But he did not beat you on close communion, I hope, did he?" "We did not treat that subject exactly." "What then?"  "We were disputing about the period of the establish- ment of the Church--whether before or after Pentecost." "And did he contend that it was set up before the Pentecostal day?" "Yes, and I think he proved his position very well, too. But understand, I'll use, him up when we get to discus.- ing the orthodoxy of close communion, for I can't see any other chance for him, but defeat. I want you to make haste and get well, as you are a better theologianl than I am." "Oh, any one can use the Baptists up, on that point." "Don't be too sanguine, Mr. Sumner, for Mr - Westo l understands the subject." "But you know, Doctor, that he has not the argunieit on his side, that we have. Every pne but the Baptists, condemns it; and,I might say with correctness, that ma- ny of them are silently opposed to it. Here, feel of inv pulse, and see if I have much fever. I could hardly con- tent myself at home to-day. I concluded to go once, anyhow, but I had not the strength to walk." "You had not, indeed, if you have had as much fever all day as you have now," said the Doctor, after noting the time of his pulsations. 'You ought to be taking some palliating medicine, to cool your fever down. You must not think too much about this investigation; the constant excitement of such thought, might leave you liable to a spell of brain fever." "Oh no, Doctor, I am not sick much. I will be with you all to-morrow, I think." "Then you will have to take medicine." "I have already taken some. 'Who was at the Hall  to-day?" he asked, thinking more about what was going on there, than of himself. "Nb one besides Mr. Weston and his daughter." Did the ladies take any interest in the a[air?" Yes, both seemed very much interested. I wish you had been there, to have heard Annie Bacon give it to Mr. Weston, about how she viewed close communion; it would have done you good."  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8270-00000027"/> 48       LEANDE]R HALL. "She is sound in the doctrine, is she?' "Yes indeed, that she is." "Well, who could be otherwise, but those who have suffered themselves to become ultra by the influence of prejudice? I think it is the most untenable doctrine for which I ever heard of'any sensible people contending." "So do T. It looks like they think that the Lord's Supper belongs to them alone. Indeed, they act like they were the only people in the world good enough, to celebrate it. As for my part, as Mr. Bacon said to-day, I want all Christians to partake of it, let them be of what denomination they may, The doctrine savours so strong- ly of bigotry, that it almost makes me hate the Baptists." "I hope, Doctor, we will be able to wipe this heresy out, in this effort." "But you know, Mr. Sumner, Baptists are so hard to convince." -"Yes, I know, you might talk to them always, and even persecute them, but you can never make anything out of them but dippers and close communionists. One had better spend his time in addressing a stone." "That's true, Mr. Sumner, yet we may effect some good, for you know there are so few in M-  that be- lieve in close communion.-f "That is a consideratio :' We must do our best." "Yes, we must, for much idpends on our exertions." Dr. Boon did not tarry long; but he turned -fromn the bed-side to be a prey again to the melancholy spirits which accompanied him before, and from which he had so precipitately fled. His shop was his only resort again, and in vain did he- try to keep the gloomy picture out of his mind. "For we are all the children of God, by FAITH in Christ Jesus," would haunt him in silent whisperings, in spite of efforts to the contrary. "It strikes me," he found himself thinking, before he was aware of it, "that if baptism is for the remission of sins, faith would not be termed the ligament. But pshaw, pshaw, there it is again! I know Peter did say, be bap- tized for the remission of sins, and so I'll be content with it," he consoled himself. ' -   CHAPTER IV. T HE INVESTIGATION. THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, IN WHCH IT IS AGOPIn THAT THE LORD'S SUPPER IS A CHURCH ORDINANCE EXCLUSIVELY,  AND PROVEN THAT THERE IS BUT ONE CHURCH, AS THERE Ib "-One Lord, onefatAh, o02e baptis2m."

"Wherefore, my brethren, then ye cohme together to eat, tarry one for anoth'rc. --Eph. iv: 5; Cor. xii: 12;xi: 33. THaE second morning of the investigation dawned. Old Sol struggled for a while with a light blue bank that spread itself in defiance, across the disc of his fiery visage. Dr. Boon looked out, and hoped it would rain! But soon the golden rays of'the sun rifted the cloid-barrier and burst forth in dazzling glory; to call up the " sleepers nito day." The grand Ohio flowed on in her banks, fretted by the uneven path, and ruffled by the gentle breeze, while the many tribes of birds, true to their impulses of instinct, came early to chant their choral praise, and dip tleir plumage in the silvery bosom of the placid stream; and ever and anon, a gentle cooing of the dove, the shrill note from the clarion songster, the voice of the bugle, the sighs from. the. heaving river, as in' pulsation, she beat her limpid waves against the confines of her course, all, all harmonizing with the music of Nature, like a thou- sand-stringed instrument.  Leander Hall lifted up its majestic head, as if to catch the first rays of the sun, as he pursued his onward course over the western world. The tall' peaks of the gigantic hills, on the opposite side of the Ohio, that seemed col- lateral with the swimming incense of the deep blue sky, formed a picture of grandeur, fascinating in an unlimited- degree to the eye of the artistic observer. Mr. Sumner was early to pay his devoirs at Leander Hall, for before the people of M-- were thoroughly  eetoogl  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8270-00000028"/> astir, he was wending his way thitherward, no doubt from an invitation of-its owner, for Mr. Bacon stood in the door, ready to receive him, with a welcome smile. "Glad to see you this morning, Bro. Summer," said he, as he led the way into his study. "I had begun to get downright uneasy about you," he added, as he handted him a chair.  "I thank you for your interest, Bro. Bacon, but it was only an attack of chills. I don't feel entirely stout this morning, yet I think I can go through the day's service without suffering any inconvenience.. How did you conle  out yesterday?" "Well, now, to tell the truth, not quite as well as I hoped; but you know Weston is bound to quibble to get along."  "Yes, I know he can't meet us on open grounds. 1 ssaw Dr. Boon last evening; he told me that Mr. Weston was faster than you had calculated. But you know lie did not treat close communion." "No, he has got to prove everything, before he can prove close communion." In a moment, Annie came in, which put an end to the conversation on that topic. She was solicitous about his health.  "I didn't really expect to see you, this morning, Mr. Sumner," she remarked as she seated herself. "I believe, Miss Annie, it is by Divine Providence that I am permitted to be here this morning." Annie thought so too. Breakfast was soon announced.  ZEight o'clock found the little group assembled in the library again, preparatory to the investigation of the great truths of Jesus. Mr. Bacon walked uneasily across the floor several times, but fearing that his anxiety might be noticed, he took a seat, and began thumping a tune on the table with his fingers, every now and then, glancing at Mr. Weston. There was a painful silence, which no one felt at liberty to break, or had the courage. Mr. Weston was busy looking over a book. He finish- ed reading, and then laid it down. "Gentlemen," he said, "there is no necessity for delay now, but there certainly is a necessity for expediency, ' f   the:subjeft which we have before us, is long and tedious; let us begin at once." Then Mr. Sumner, thinking it his place to speak, be- gan an apology for his absence- "I regret sincerely at having to be absent on yesterday, but I hope to-day will be equally propitious for the in- vestigation of this momentous subject, and that it may he the day when the untrammeled Truth will tear asuin- 'ler this schism, close communion, and destroy every lin- eamlent of its existence, so that in time to come, it will be obliterated from memory orihistory." This was a bold speech; he gathered strength from it. and proceeded: "It is conceded, Mr. Weston, by every religious class in the known world, that this institution, i. e. the Raptist formula, is unchristian-like, uncharitable, bigoted, selfish, and intolerable in the extreme." (Here his catalogue of- epithets became exhausted-the old routine of words ap- plied to the Baptists.) "Their practices are in direct antagonism to the liberal principles which should char-  acterize the Christian's life. This error, Mr. Weston, is discernable everywhere." "And yet, my dear Mr. Sumner, your asserlting it, and the world's sanction, cannot make it irnfallible. The Bible  must prove it, or your position must )e accounted as unl-  orthodox. If from this boolk you cannot prove me wronig, then I am right, for what it does not prove against me, it proves for me. It is the grand witness of Truth, and jus- ' tice, and it is the 'Light that shineth into darkness.' It is a witness either for you and against me, or folr me and against you. If it bears witness of my incorrectness, then it bears witness of your correctness; on the other hand, if it bears witness of my correctness, then it testifies of your incorrectness; forl we are wholly antagonistic inl sentiment, as far as the ordinances go, and in many other: doctrines." "But sir, your own man, Robert Hall, one of the great- est men that ever belonged to your Church, contended against close communion. -He says that it is calculated to make the Christian narrow-minded-"  "I beg your pardon, Mr. Sumner, we are not examin- ing Robert Hall, or any other great man, but the Bible- the law and the testimony." I  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8270-00000029"/> 5ys       LI a a ^A' " "BI*'e1 -  - h me "Don't you lay any stress on the opinions of such mon as Robert 'iIall?" ' I must tell you again, we lay no stress on any great man's opinion, when trying to prove a point in Theology. Here, take this Bible, instead of Robert Hall, and if with-. in its sacred lids you can prove us at grievOUS fault, I'll recant my preconceived views before the world." "Sir, your fault as a denomination is so evident, that the world, in its wickedness, points the finger of reproof at it. In practicing, close communion, you say by that act, that you are better than other Chstans. Now is not this sufficient to stigmatize your nane? Further- more, you rebaptize persons coming from other Churches, who have been lawfully baptized, and you declare by that act, that no one has a right to baptize but you; what speak these facts?" "They speak that we are following after Christ, to the exclusion of worldly opinions. We hold to close com- munion, because we believe that no other Church can scripturally or genealogically claim to be the true Church. WTe do not believe that every society of this age, which claims the term church,can be found of lawful birth. We know that no .one has a right to establish a Church but God, and we know also, that he has never set up but one Church, and to that visible organization, he certinly left some pattern, for its members to follow after, and that example was himself! Jesus walked, as he wished all Christians to walk. EIe commanded what he wished to be obeyed, and nothing more, and the disciples were obligated to teach converts to observe ALL THNGS,' what- soever our Saviour commanded, and nothing else. It may be urged that the Holy Spirit taught the Apostles what instructions to give to the Church, but I remark, that it should only ' teach all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, wrhatsoever 1 have said unto you;' evi- dently showing that TPaul's writings, together with the instructions given by other Apostles, were all in Christ's day, taught. Christ left nothing unsaid, no stone un- turned, Zo gap in the building, which the Church needed. He ratified the ordinance of baptism, he institued the Supper-in short, he saw his Church, a fitly framed habi- tation, the- workmanship of his own hands, ere he did the expiatory deed, on the cross."    "Yet, sir, that is no evidence of close communion, as 1 can see. It only goes to prove thlat Christ instituted the Supper, that it belonged to Him, iand not to you Baptists, and it is for Him to say wlho shall participate, not the Baptists."                  ' "Just so. We do not claim the prerogative of saying who shall participate. The institultion certainly belongs to Christ exclusively, and ll I has given a law by which the communicants are to know of their right, and ' Who- soever shall keep the wihole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.' (James ii: 10.) Or he that knowingly violates any given, law, does violence to, or sets at naught the Law-,'iver. Then to observe the Lord's Supper in any other wa tIhaln e has prescribed, or with- out observing first, all o(f 'his commandnments that were given prior to this, is a flagrant violation of-the law, and a sin against:tlhe Law-giver." "We can admit what you say, Mr. Weston, and then invite all Christians to the table. We profess to abide by the law--to obseirve the commandments, before partici- pating in this holy ordinance." "You mlay prof'ess it, but certainly do not practice it- nor do you prol'-esse to observe all; you set at naught the command of )baptism, for one thing, and substitute a con- venient and unmeaning mode to suit yourself." "Why, Mr. Weston!" exclaimed Mr. Bacon, who had remained silent for sonie time, " do you dare to presume to assert that our mode of baptism is not valid?" "I do, sir, indeed; but that is not the question under dispute now. Let us first examine this hobby which youi Methodist friends term 'ciose Co'irunion.' On yesterday, Dr. Boon here (turning to him) and myself, looked into the establishment of the visible Church of Christ. (Dr. Boon did not wish to be reminded of it.) , He granted that the Supper was an institution belonging to the Church. This, I presume, you will also."  "Certainly, it belongs to the Church."  "And also. a Ncew Testament ordinance?" "Of course." "Then we find its first observance in the Church." "That is nlot at all objectionable, Mr. Weston. We - don't send it out of the Church. We all agree that that  would be an illegal process."               *,  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8270-00000030"/> 54       LEANDER HALL. "S much you profess, but before we are' through, I think I can prove to your satisfaction that you do cause its celebration outside of the Church." "How?" asked Mr. Bacon, somewhat agitated. "By proving that the Methodist Church is not the Church of Christ, but is only a religious society set up - by men, uninspired, UNRE ENERATED, and unconverted.  "' Mr. Weston, what do you mean?" thundered out 'MLr. Bacon again. "I mean what I say. In time, I promise to prove this, by the evidence of John Wesley himself." Annie was astonished at what she thought his impu- dence. Mr. Bacon was confounded. Mr. Sumner had read Wesley's journals, and knew that Mr. Weston hinted at the truth, so he said nothing. "The Lord's Supper, we find, was throughout the New Testament confined to the Church; but let us notice its observance, and the references made to it. First comes the "Institution. "' And as they were eating, (that is, the Passover,) Jesus took bread and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said: Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it, for this is my blood of the Newe Testamenlt, whc-} is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto von that I will not drink hence- forth of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with yon ill my Father's kingdom.' (Matt. xxvi: 26-'29.) "'A nd as they did eat, Jests took bread, and blessed and lrake it, and gave it to them, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them; and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for mauy.. Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of'the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.' (Mark xiv: 22-25.) "' And he took-- bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you; this do in remembrance of me. Likewise   THE INVESTrOATION.         55 also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood, which is shed for you.' (Luke xxii:' 19, 20. "'For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you. That the Lord-Jesus, the same night in which-he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had riven thanks, he brake it and said, Take, eat; thisis my body which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner, also, he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the New Testa- ment in my blood; this do ye as oft as ye drink it, in re- melnbrance of me.' (1 Cor. xi: 23-25.) "Her we have the institution," continued Mr. Wes- ton, as lie closed the Bible. "Let us draw observations fI'utm what we have read: "1st. That the Apostles only, partook of this institu- tion. "2d. They waere all baptized believers, or rather mem- bers of that Clurch which Christ promised by their tes- timony to build up, and against which, he declared, the gates of hell should not prevail.

Christ did not extend the sacrament to the own- er of the house in which they tarried, this proving that it was designed in a restricted sense-for those who had  complied with the requirements of the Chlurch-repent-  ance, faith in Christ, and baptism for, or because of, the the remission of sins," concluded Mr. Weston.  Annie Bacon was so intensely interested, that she did not-observe the furtive glances which the young preacher 8s often involuntarily cast at her, evidently watching the effects of Mr. Weston's remarks. He was fearful lest that would not be good. Mr. Weston resumed the investigation, as he was unin- terrupted-Mr. Sumner knowing nothing to say, and Mr. Bacon being somewhat puzzled. "Now, for the furtherance of this scheme, let us see more particularly the "Design and meaning of this ceremony: 'For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ve do show the Lord's death till he come.' (1 Cor. xi: 26.) The cup A 2r                 i  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8270-00000031"/> 56       LEANDER HALL. of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we be- ing many are one bread, and one body, for we are all par- takers of that one bread.' (1 Cor x: 16.) "Allow me to interrupt you there, Mr. Weston," put in Mr. Sumner. "That passage, or those two-passages go to prove our position exactly. It says, 'For we being' many,' that is, there are many followers of Christ, some devout in one thing, and some in another: though we are many, we can be the same as one bread, and drink of the same cup." This slight show of argument, though no argument at all, caused a little brightness to lighten up Mr. Bacon's face.          ' "That's right,-Brother Sumner!" he exclaimed, rub- bing his hands. "That's right:-Christ did mean for us all to commune together, and it will tell itself, in spite of all the theology that Mr. Weston can bring up to the con- trary." "Not so fast, my dear sir!-if there was any evidence of there being more than one Church, we might agree with you; we'll come to that point directly-that is, the 'plu- rality of churches.' Now let us calculate from the pass- ages just cited. 1. The Lord gave the command to none but the bap- tized and regenerated, consequently, those to whom Paul had reference, were the baptized-those who had really, in spirit and truth, felt the value of the blood of Christ- his burial already figured in the ordinance of baptism, he himself having submitted to it before partaking of the Supper, because 'it becometh us to fulfill all righteous- ness. Right here, a thought of importance, generated by the example before us, comes up to remind poor fall- en man of the spirit which characterized our Saviour in his obedience to the Father, and it should startle our hearts from the lethargy in which we are enveloped on this point. If Christ in his perfection, was so particular as to fulfill every appearance of righteousness, in the act of submit- ting to the ordinance of baptism, should not the sinner be more so? Ah, how can he, with such impunity, set aside our Saviou's commands, when he himself was so particu- lar to observe them in the spirit and letter? Men talk   TEE INVESTIGATION.        a5 obot .baptism as being nonessential, but our Saviour did pot view it thus; it was a righteousness which becom- eth the Christian to fulfil. But to proceed with the sub- ject.' 2. Unless we have embraced the same doctrine and have been baptized like our Saviour, we have no right to commune, as it was a church ordinance, and as Christ died for that Church, and gave a pattern of rules, for'the sin- ner to observe first." "But, Mr. Weston, if we love Christ, where is the sin in commluning?" asked Annie. "Loving Christ is not an admissible plea for commu- nion, as we all concede that it is exclusively a Church or- dinance. The ' good man of the house' in wnmch the Sup- per was institute, aai not participate. He certainly loved Carist, and believed that he was the Master, but we have no evidence that he belonged to the Church, nor did he partake of the-Supper. We will proceed to examine the "Reproofs and Directions concerning its Observance." "'For, first of all, when ye come together in the Church, I hear that there be divisions among you, and I partly believe it When ye come together, therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper: for in eating, every one taketh before other, his own supper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken, (filled). What? have ye not houses to eat and drink in? dispise ye the Church of God and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup: for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. Wherefore my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condem- nation.' (1 Cor. xi: 18-34.) '"Paul in this reproof, clearly sets forth the flact that the Supper belongs exclusively to the Church, for he en- joines that they 'tarry one for another' and not to cele- brate our Lord's death as an individual feast, but as a   &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8270-00000032"/> "EANDER HALL.:- Chturih. Signifying, that a misconception of itrim:pOrt, and improper manner of its celebration would lead unto condemnation. Now let us notice the "Allusions to its Observance."                 i "'And they (the: converts of Jerusalem,) continued in breaking of bread,' (Acts ii: 42). "And they continned ilil.,, with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread t'ro)l house to house,"'(verse 46).  '- And upon the-first day of the week, then the deci- pies came together to break bread,' (x: 7). 'When he theret'ore, was come up again, and- ad broken bread,' (verse 11). Here we find it referred to as commemorated ini a body, several times, and confined strictly to the Chirbch. If to the-Church, then there is a law prescribing the requirements before church membership. If other- wise, it would have been left to the varying.tastes of mankind to judge for themselves, who would have chang- ed the ordinances and laws, to suit their inclinations and  conveniences. Hence we find that.rigthful membership with that Church, a prerequisite to the right'of commu- nion, as it is exclusively a Church ordinance. ' We have no right to send the sacred elements out of the Church,' says the late Dr. Griffin. And, Dr. Wall, (the celebrated Pedo-babtist historian) says, that none ever held forth the absurd idea of giving the eucharist to any but the babtized, or church members.. "There wasno plurality of the Church,forChrist speaks of it as one Church, and the Apostle Paul says it has .OnB LORD, ONE FAITH, oNE BAPTISM.'" "But you will admit that there were branches, Mr. Weston, for Christ speaks of branches-he the vine,' having branches." "-He ,spake of himself as being the head, and :his die.: ciples as the members of the body. You cannot make anything else of that passage. Sir, to contend for a plun rality of Churches, you must have a plurality of Church- regulations, such as. baptisms, faiths, etc., etc., which" would be equal to the. 'rending of the seamless garment of our Saviour.' 'Also, it would constitute a: departure from the divine model! Will yqu allow me to ask you a question here, Mr. Sumner? which course will throw some light on the subject.                              i   THE INVESTIGATION.   " Crtainly," was the brief reply. "But the 'branch system' Brother Sumner! stick to it. The 'vine' and ' the branches' can't be gotten oyer so easily, Mr. Weston. It must be read out here for our benefit. - I know Christ did mean more than one Church, or why does he speak of "branches?'" exclaimed Mr. Bacon, in one breath. "You shall be gratified," said Mr. Weston, handing him the Bible. "Read the passage out, so we all can hear it." Mr. Bacon took the book and read-""'I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, etc.'" He kept silent, ftor it did not sound like he had been accustomed to think. Perhaps there was some. mistake, so he looked at it again, but rio, he had read it correctly, so he laid down the Bible. "You hiave read it Mr. Bacon," interrupted Mr. Wes- ton, "I presume by your silence, you understand it, and you find nothing in it to justify the conclusion that Christ had any reference to a plurality of Churches, do you ?" Mr. Bacon did not , xactly know, so he made no reply. "Allow mne,,' continued Mr. Weston, "to answer for you. Youv ID NOT!' Christ was only speaking to indi- viduals as constituting one body, himself being the head. 'If a imani, (not a C!hurch) abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branchl, the L b'ranlies' evidently meaning the indi- vidual mana insteadl of Churchles.  That is all that-can be made of tlhat passage; let mnen construe it as they will. I ha\ e heard Methodist preachers open the doors of their Church saying, 'Come on my friends, ceme on now, and join this branch of the Great Church of God. We are one of the branches of the great vine which is Christ, come go with us to glory !' evidently taking :their conclu- sions from that very same passage, which, if looked at right- ly, goes in direct reverson to their construction." Mr. Bacon was sorry enough that the " branch" sub- ject was brought up. Mr. Sumner could not sit exactly easy in his chair: he cast several imploring glances- at Mr. Bacon, but the dye was cast.       - "So much for that," continued Mr. Weston seeing- that he was uninterrupted. "This 'branch' subject4, Mr. Sumner, has. given birth to several questions instead -of   &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8270-00000033"/> "EANDER HALL. one. I presume that you are a strong advocate of the identity of the old Jewish, and the Christian Church, are you not?" I am." "Then there is an inconsistency in the onset. If you wish to make the two Churches in question one and the same Church, why do you wisli to cut it up into so many divisions, at the same time contending for one and the only Church from the Abrahamic covenant? This is a gross inconsistency, and we must conclude, founded on a necessity, growing out of policy." All present saw the force of the argument, and. some felt it in no pleasant perception. Annie was surprised. Light was dispersing the cloud of incomprehension under which she had labored. "But to the next question. Do you, Mr. Sumner, as a Church, claim to be of the divine model, as given in the Scriptures?" " Certainly we do, or what title could we have to claim to be a Church at all?"  "None whatever. Now do you believe that Christ es- tablished the Baptist Church, the Methodist and the Episcopal Churches, and every other denomination that now exists, and claim to be the Chuich?" " Of their names, I cannot think that he did." " Nor of their creeds, do you ?" " Of such a multiplicity of creeds, differing so much, I cannot think that he did."  " Since you have answered these questions, now I am ready for another class. Why did the Episcopal Church withdraw from the Pope's supremacy, and institute a new Church ?-what did it declare by that act?" "It signified that the Pope's supremacy wastan error, and the Roman Church a schism." "'And furthermore, that the Roman Church was un- scriptural, and it wished to establish a scriptural Church. You can but admit this." "Of course, I meant as much, if I did not say it." "Now why does this Church still continue since the rise of other orders'?" " Because it still avows that all other orders of Churches are unscriptural, and it, only, right." " Now I'll ask another simple question and we'll leave   THE IN-VEflT-IGATION.           -   61   that Church. Since it withdrew  from  the Roman, placing itself antagonistic to that Church, differing fun- damentally-since it will not be recognized by the world, as belonging to that Church, because of itsunscriptural- ness, I ask you, can it, with any consistency of principles, affiliate with that which it has declared to the world as being unworthy of its membership, its prayers and influence, and as being no Church at all ?"    ' "Aye, there's the rub!" Mr. Sumner could not answer this question candidly, without renouncing his position. He saw it and hesi- tated. Mr. Bacon's chair was not in the right place. Dr. Boon looked puzzled and surprised. The thing had never appeared to him in such a light before. But it would not do to yield his ground by open confession, so he kept silence. Close communion was not popular, and he did not care to embrace it. Mr. Weston again urged au answer, but to no purpose, as to refutation. "I shall expect some definite reply to this question, Mr. Sumner, or it will have to pass for an acknowledged inconsistelncy." "Well, sir, I must say that they did not disagree as to the Lord's Supper, so they still could commune without any violation of their principles."  - "But supposing that they had disagreed in this only,. holding the same views on all creeds, yet having a sepa- rate organization, could they affiliate in baptism and other things in which they' did agree?!! We must think, however, that they disagreed essentially, funda- mentally, and to the exclusion of all fellowship, or joint participation, as their blood, by fountains, attested their antagonism. But enough of this argument, for you have no parallel. I only add, if ihere is sufficient necessity to sustain a separate and distinct Church in baptism, opinions and creeds of any kind, then there is sufficient -reason for'sustaining a separate Church in communion." Mr. Bacon evidently wished twelve o'clock would come, for he glanced at his watch several times very anxiously. Mr. Weston continued: "The same may be said of the ecclesiastical order-in 'which comes the Presbyterian Church, whose founder was Calvin.

Why do they still per- petuate this order since the rise of other Chuliches, if they do inot still believe it the only scriptural one in existence? Can they affiliate with the Cilurches which they have renounced, and do still renolldce when they acknowledge that the Supplller belongs to the Church only? Tell me plailly, Mr Snneller, it thelre would be anty consistency inl such a thing? I think not. If I am wrong, convince me; if not, 1)e convinced yourself, as we disagree on this point." * ,There must be some answer to this appeal. Mr. Bacon cast a look of almost despair at lhis colleague, but he saw but little hope there. Dr. Boon began to reconcile hinmelf to the evidence instead of trying to refuite it. ItH was besoming some- what willing to be convinced, as le saw no other chalnce. The eelaireisseme;nt was a feast to Aunie, for close com- munion was the greatest objection she urged against the Baptists. "Oh, well, Mr. Weston," replied Mr. Sunller, after so long a time, "its not a matter of much importance any- way; (it wOas before the discussion )began) so it is not worth while to dwell on this point." "Nor will we, since you cannot adduce a single reason of refutation. Let us to another point. Your own Church comes .iext."

(two distinct denominations) are the true and only true Church of Christ!" Mr. Sumner saw -the inconsistency, and denoted it, un- intentionally, by a dolorous look. Mr. Weston con- tinued: "Again: Why did Barton Stone and others secede from the Presbyterianl Clhurch and set up another order-' Bap- tism for the remission of sins '-if they did not think that all other classes were unscr ltural? And why did Alex- ander Campbell withldraw from the Baptist Church and embrace that ordei; if lie did not think that the doe- triPe taught by the Baptists was heresy? Could he, after that act, commune with them, or any other denomination, since he declared that -none were the true Church? and admitting also that the Supper belongs to the true Church of Christ alohe. I say, how could he, with consistency of principle, or even without perjury-how could he com- mune with another denomination which he has declared s' a scthism, while admitting that the eucharist belongs only to the Church of Christ?.- But allow me to draw up theconclusions deduced, in which we agree: "1. There is but one Church of God.  "2. 'One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism.' "3. The Lord's Supper. "4. These are the elements of that Church. "Si ce every Church claims to be that divine model, and since but one Church can be it, let us examine into the Church, or Churches, with which you ask me to com- mune, having the Bible as our standard, and not the tra- ditions of men. If we find that true Church, then let us; all comlmune with it, whenwe have attained membership in it, irrespective of our former views. As the Meth- odist E. Church is before us, and is older than the Camp- bellite Church, let us first examine its creeds, and keep the Bille as a talisman by which to measure and com- pare."

Dr. Boon did not have the courage to attend. The scene of the day previous had givel him much food for melancholy thought. True to his promise, he had offered assistance to George Kent, which had been accepted. It was arranged that the youth should live on a farm, and receive, as remuneration, his board, schooling, &amp;c., a part of the year for working the other. It must be remem- bered that Dr. Boou was not wealthy, consequently this was the best he could do for his young friend. Mr. Sumner went by to accompany Annie to the burial, and as they walked from l ence ta conversation occurred between them, which we will here relate. It must be held in mind that Annie was becoming very thoughtful on the turn ot the investigation, but had not 4 as yet made any revelation of that fitel. As they were returning, something cm'l1  , under their observation which attracted attention, and reverted their memory, accidentally and simultaneously, to, the morning exercise, and called to Annie's nind the circumstances connected therewith. "Oh! I had almost forgotten, Mr. Sumner, to ask you how you like Mr. Weston. Don't you think he is a good looking man ? "Well, as to comeliness of person, I think he'll do very well." "But you know that is not what I meant. I mean be- nevolence and benignuncy of countenance. Now say, is he not prepossessing in appearance ? "Well, he is a man whom , if you can agree with in sentiment, I suppose you could get'along with very well." " Still, that's an evasive answer, Mr. Sumner." "What would you have me to say, then ?" he asked in rather a petulent tone. Annie saw that the subject did not please him.

"In that I believe he is right, if ile can prove from thic Bible that the Baptist is the oully Church.

"Then you are a close corrmuniollst !" "I am, though I do not know yet but that our Church is right, hence I am foir having communion restricted to our Church." "You certainly h ave too much intelligence, Annie, to let that man's quibbling persuade you into such a notion." Why! I don't think he quibbled at all, Mr. Sumner." Mr. Sumner, lby -saying this, wislhed to reach her by flattery, but liot soi, for Annie saw il a. moment the de- sign and repudiated it. "Furthermore," she continued, "if it is owing to the want of undertttanding that he has converted me to his belief, why did ulot you refute the argument, and make me believe otherwlise? It was your part to convince Mr. Weston of his error, not for him to convince me rof mine!" "But, Annie," lie expostulated, branching on another limb, "what wo uld the people of M-     think if they knew that you hlad yielded to that abomlinable dogma?"

I think he advocates the correct doctrine of the Bible in that respect." "Well, here we are at your father's house; think what a conversation we have held, coming from a burial," in- terrupted Mr. Sumner.

Annie promised to. accompany Mr. Sumner to Church, out in the country, the next day which was Sabbath. Early in the morning, he might have been seen draw- ing up his reins before Mr. Bacon's premises. for Annie. The Church being some distance, they started as soon as she was ready. "There are some infants to be baptized," he remarked as he stepped into the buggy. "It will take considerable time to attend to that matter," he added, as he gave his horse the signal for traveling.  The drive was very pleasant, as the day was not as warm as usual for the season, and the roads fine. A turnpike ran from M-- out tg the town of B--, on which pike was the Church. The people of that Parish were plain and unpretending, there being sufficient wealth   THE BURIAL.          69 dent livers. There were some pretty farms spread along on the road, lying almost as level as a table, but gen- erally the country was broken. The road wound its way through a mass of hills. in a narrow defile, which, on either side,' presented quite a picturesque scene. As it might, in the language of the country be said, the hills were so closely jammed that an individual might stand on the pinnacle of one, and hoe corn on another, being inter- sected by a mere chastm (f a valley. This rugged scene, however, did not extend throughout the country; though the hills seemed interminable, they found a broken link in the course of three miles, the rest of the country be- ing level and tillable. It was a happy day to Mr. Sumner. All nature seemed carolling an offering to lis lhappiness, and when he drove up; several of the most influential brethren stood ready for his reception. His betrotlhmnt was generally known and approved by the Churches.  - When the sermon was over, and a few desultory re- marks made, apropriate to the ordinance about to be performed, Mr. Sunmier then requested the parents to seat themselves with their infants on a bench convenient, while the congregation rose to their feet and sang a hymn. There were iour or five infants as applicants for baptism! As each little babe felt the cool water sprinkled in its face, a consequent scream, or catching of the breath told "  plainly of the folly of pronouncing the Father, Son and 1Holy Ghost over such unconscious objects. I ask, candidi, whloever 1my  lerformn this, does your conscience approve pf  such an act?  I stand aghast at the idea of man's daring' to introduce an unau- thorized institution in God's Church, and in-his name! Surely they know not what they do! but in vain do- men serve God, tmeachig for doctrines the commandments of men. There was no lack for invitations to dine among the brotherhood. Indeed they beseiged Mrl. Simner so with insistings, that he uhardly knew where to go, but of a 1e- cessity must dine on the road leading back to M -.

"It is this: If infants are depraved, (and you say they are,) t thentheir depravity must be brought up under the similitude of 'dogs,' or ' swine,' for human depravity is so represented, as we are commanded to give not that which is holy to the dogs, we cannot give baptism to infants." "Why so?" he quickly interrogated, becoming uneasy. "Because, baptism is holy, and should not be given to anything brought under the similitude of 'dosa or 'swine,' lest the recipient, like the 'dogs' ald ' swine.' fail to appreciate the gift, and turn again and ( rend' iil." "Wiy, Annie, where did you imbibe such notiotas? From Mr. Weston, I'warrant." "No, I did not. They were natural thoughts, formed while reflecting on the subject." Mr. Sumner, seeing the force of the argtment, and not knowing exactly what reply to make, remained silent. They returned to M--  just as the sun was inaking its exit from this Hemisphere. The straggling raiys played a crimson hue on the knotty clouds that encirclerl heaven's vault, like a gorgeous belt. The gloriouis sun- set?

BY THE RULE GIVEN, WHICH IS, "By their fruits ye shall know them.'-Matt. vii: 20. SABBATH was a day of respite to the disputants, and Particularly appreciated by Mr. Sumner and Dr. Boon. ro the former it was rest from a laborious task; to Lhe latter, it afforded a chance to reconsider the evidences Lbought up in favor of close-communion, and to become reconciled to views hitherto held in antagonism, re- arded- as ill-founded and repugnant to the Christian feeligfs, or ideas of love, ,, " Anid so you did not get off, Bro. Sampson ? "No, the miischief on it! The clerk didn't get the matter fixed up in time. But a truce to such things. How did you come out, over at the Hall yesterday ?" "Bad enough !" " Why, what's Sumner about ?" I believe. he felt several times like he was about the Old Boy, or the Old Boy was about him, one  ' Ile was used up, then ?" Yes, coinpletely  Weston led" us through in good order." This conversation took place between preacher Samp- son and Dr. Boon. Upon this communication, the preacher stood several moments in reflection. Here was a perplexity.  What induction now?. ,oWell, I can't see, Doctor, what will or could be done next. If I could only be there; but things are so ar- ranged that I am bound to leave M--  in the morning. Perhaps nowP've lost a thousand dollars by delay." ' But, Bro. Sampson, couldn't you employ an agent? 'his is a matter of great importance, both to us and to our cause. If we give the thing up now, the whole toAwn of M' - will cry out," pleaded Dr. Boon, almost des pairingly.    "Impossible! I am bound to be there in Derson. What point are you at now ?"  i f1  ~Dr. Boon told him. " Oh, well, it's left with Sumner now; let him attend to it. If I were there, I could do nothing at this period,' consolingly said Mr. Sampson. l    -~ The conversation was interrupted by the ringing of the Church bell, calling together the followers of the Oracle of Bethany. Preacher Sampson always had a good congregation to hear him. The Church members were the most respect- able people in the whole country around, and the great i-|     number of woi'shippers resulted from the fact, that it ti      sounded so grand to have one's name spoken in connec- tion with the Refor'med Church. It was the monied Church, and a religious doing Church. The sermons delivered there regularly, were the pro- duction of classifiction, and were concise enough to suit the most fastidious. Every particle of solecism was abol- ished, even in the minutest degree. In fact; their faultless arrangement, and strict adherence to grammar, formed principally the basis';of the reputation, which they won. A peep in the Church, if you please, ere we leave the rostrum of this sanctuary. As we enter, our passport seems to be silently demand- ed which is, Formality! As we seat ourself, a mental prayer is involuntarily ejaculated, which proves to be a contagion of the atmosphere, and that emits the voiceless sound of lFormality!  We look at the sisterhood, and what it is that meets our eye, but Formality! We cast our eye around at the brotherhood, and what do we see there, beaming through blank abstinence, but Formality? The very walls seem painted in hieroglyphics, whose in- terpretation is, Formality ! The sound emitted from the tabernacle, is lollow ! hollow ! And-the sermons of meta- physical lore, are but re-reforms from the formal missals of-Rome! (Baptism for the remission of sins, is a spe- cies of Catholicism, generated by infant Baptism.) From the Church, let us wend our way to the ball- room. Who there mingle in the dance, more than the sis- ters of Bethany? Clear the halls of Terpsichore, and the merchandise will be that of The Current Reforma- tion of 1804!

Who stands behind the counter, vending the poisonous alcohol to the susceptible ones of our country'? A mem- ber, it may be, of the great mount of Bethany!"Where- fore, by their fruits ye shall know them," again comes up in the mental vision. This is the religion of the head, introduced by metaphysical reasoning! IMy God! is this the religion of Jesus? Is there nothing but reason and philosophy to bind our hearts to him? Let reason build her temple of Philosophy, and let vascillating man worship therein, but the Spirit will finally tear down this edifice, which in time will be accounted among the ruins of the "abominations of the earth," which found their birth within the gates of mystic Babylon. Their "fruits" already indicate this. Trace the rise of all false doctrines of the earth, and we find its source in "THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH!" viz: the Roman Catholic Church! (Rev. xvii: 5.) Then I beseech you, my Chris- tiani friends, "Come out of her-that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." But why write thus? Men's hearts are hardened, and set in them to doevil. Look at the Church at M--. The members are in'the Church, and yet in the world! Some are engaged as Satan's emissaries, and still Church mem- bers! Can a man serve two masters? Reader, judge. I would pray, yea, I would throw myself on my knees and implore every Campbellite in the land, to reflect, and take a thorough self-examination, as he or she reads these lines. What are your fruits? How are you living? To which of your masters do you give the most attention? You cannot serve God and mammon. The town of AM-- was rife with excitement. It was rumored that Mr. Sumner was used up-that the Baptist preacher had the decided advantage on Saturday morn- ing, when the investigation was suspended. Mrs. Crow gathered around her a phalanx of friends to lamnent the sad catastrophe. But how had it gotten out? Dr. Boon had intimated it to several friends, and they happened to have curious wives, and so, to spread the news, required no telegraph of modern invention. "I didn't call, Sister Crow, because I'm in the habit of visiting on the Sabbath, but I couldn't stay at home and   -THE INVESTIGATION.       75 have the thing working on my mind the whole evening." "Why, Sister Blewett, what do you mean?" asked Mrs. Crow, as she handed her visitor a chair. "I mean Bro. Sumner's failure yesterday, to hush forev- er that whim of the Baptists."  "4Oh, yes; Sister Garth and I have just been talking about it. :Do you know, Sister Blewett, where Bro. Sum- ner is to-day?" "I suppose he has gone out in the country. Hasn't he an appointment out there somewhere to-day?" "Yes, sure enough; I had forgotten; this is his day in course out there. :It is a great pity Sister Blewett, that the thing was ever started, as there is no telling where it will end." "Yes it is, but this is always the way. I've known it- to he the case all my life; whenever there is a stir among the Baptists, by strategy, and cunning, some way they always manage to carry the day." "They had better have let the thing rested," said Mrs. Bunch, helping herself to a pinch of snuff "But how could they, when that babbler forced it on them?" asked Mrs. Crow, (She forgot that Mr. Bacon urged the matter on Mr. Weston). "Oh, well," consoled another, "there can be nothing done, only don't let us forsake Brother Sumner, no mat- ter what comes up." "Good!" exclaimed Mrs. Blewett. "The right principle!" exclaimed the third. "I know this much," said another, "the Methodists are as good as the Baptists, with all their sanctimonious scruples." This was a great concession, A few days back, there was no comparison.    " ("Oh, well, it will turn out just as the thing did seve- ral years ago. Let the Reformers hold a protracted meet- ing here, and I warrant Mr. Weston will join them," chimed in Mrs. Crow, who in the event of such a thing, would have been delighted, so great was her antipathy for the Baptists. j   "What, another Mr. Sampson case?" asked one. ' Just such." "Oh, he is too sanctimonious for that."

Such, dear reader, is a faithful record of the substance discussed by many classes. This is no fan)cy sketch, but the writer has often been subjected to the painful task of listening to the like currency. We find, without scarcely an exception, the great masses of the Methodist society, taking refuge under just such arguments. Ask them where, in the Bible, infant baptism is taught, and the answer will be: "Oh, well, it does no harm." But then, we-contend that it is a perversion of our Saviour's teachings, and it corrupts the Church. "Oh, well, the Methodists are as good as the Baptists." And this is the consolation men court, when conscience stings them for not obeying all things whatsocver our "Saviour has com- manded, and as he commanded them! Can this excuse be considered as commensurate to the offence of this willing and wilful sacriligious introduction of human supererogation? How dare vile man to trespass on the rights of Deity thus.? Grant him the right of changing or instituting one ordinance, and there will be no limit to his fancies. From immersion he drifts to sprinkling, be- cause "it wzill do; and from believer's baptism he slides into infant baptism, because " it does no harm," yet thereby, filling the Church (so called) with the corruptions of earth, forgetting that our Saviour has commanded, "If you love me, keep MY commandments." Mrs. Crow was what was termed, a "burning and shi- ning light," "the exemplary sister," etc. She looked on "Great Father Wesley," as being greater than Christ! for she acknowledged him the founder of the. Methodist Church, rather than Christ, and that with pride!! At this saying, Methodists need not start, for it is true! The thundering voice of history, together with Wesley's own testimony, proclaim this fact, and the members of the Methodist society receive it without repudiation and with approbation! But Baptists are bigoted because they will not acknowledge the lawfulness of such authority, by refusing to recognisge the Methodists as a Church! in the affiliating act of communing. Though Sabbath was a day of rest to Mr. ,Sumner, it was not so with Mr. Bacon, for he was rather uneasy throughout its long hours. Also, there was a morose- ness of mein, together with an irritable temper, accompa- nying him during that time. Nor-could any please him, though they should strive ever so hard. Once or twice, he   Lt       -  THE INVESTIGATION.      " was on the eve of prohibiting the continuation of the in- vestigation in his house, but he thought such might be ac- knowledging a defeat on Mr. Sumner's part, as he endured with great malevolence, what he termed an "ungodly, and unpropitious pursuance." Pride, pride, pride! now, was the propeller to such charters. No matter how inconsistent the theory, pride could not yield. He would have barred his head to the guillotine, rather than to have apostatized from his cher- ished sentiments. Oh, if such principle weregiven to the right cause, there would be but one Church-one com mon cause, and that would be the support of our Saviour's authority. But like the Crusader, men are led by fanat- icism to the perpetration of blood-shed and carnage; un- der the false banner of human heresy. How zealous were the cross-bearers, who engaged in such an internecine warfare against the Baptists of tie 12th and 13th centu- ries. Were they justifiable in their misguided zeal, be- cause they professed to have been conscientious in it? Ab, me! history is so replete with suchevents of depravi- ty, that we shudder, as we contemplate the tragic scenes discribed therein? i,  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8270-00000042"/> CHAPTER VII THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, IN WHCH IT IS PROVEN THAT THE CHURCH IS A BODY "CALLED OUT," AS CONCERNING IT WE ARE TOLD : "Ye are the light of the earth." "A chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath CALLED YOU OUT of darkness into his marvelous light."-Matt. v: 13; 1 Pet. ": 9. MONDAY morning came, attended with no unusual oc- currence. Mr. Sumner, when he arose that morning, felt no little degree of lassitude, nevertheless, that must pre- sent no obstacle to the investigation, for the case was im- perative and brooked no delay. As soon as he was suf- ficiently aroused to think, he began a routine of precogi- tations, as an expedient to shake off the unwelcome vis- itations of melancholy thoughts, but at last he gave up the contest, and his will became subservient to his feelings. After early breakfast, he repaired to the Hall, feeling more like he was going to a funeral than the vindication of Truth. Dr. Boon, unluckily, had a call in the colntry, in the family of one of his patrons, consequently he could not be present. He felt himself highly favored by kind Providence, as he rode through the dense forest, intlaling the salubrious air of the "glorious wilds," instead of be- ing compelled to gulp down "Mr. Weston's Theology, which, to him, was becoming so fulsome and 'nauseou,. He did not wish the patient any serious harm, but he did secretly hope that his illness might be of a protracted nature. Mollie Weston could not be in attendance either, as she was occupied in lelping her little sister off to school to the city of H--.. As usual, the company met at 8 o'clock, to prosecute the investigation. There were a few desultory remarks made prior to the   THE INVESTIGATION.         f7 commencement by Mr. Weston, who was the first to in- troduce the theme: "In the conclusion on last week I was about to men- tion a preliminary to the examination of the Methodist Church; it will do as well now to notice it, if I have the concurrence of you all."           What was that 'preliminary' you propose noticing?" asked Mr. Sumner, who now felt like it behooved him to be on the alert. "The meaning of the word 'Church."' 'But, Mr. Weston," he urged, "the simple word 'Church' don't involve much, so-suppose we proceed to some more cardinal point; and should a necessity arise for the definition of that word during the investigation, then we can notice it." "Let us mend up the gaps as we go, is my motto; it won't take us long, and we have plenty of time." Mr. Sumner assented, but could not see the point. "Why, what good can come of this tedious mode of getting along? Here we have to swing to every little reek particle, every little out-of-the-way notion, every little turn of the imagination, for hours, and all irrelevant to the point. Why not proceed to the cardinal points, as Bro. Sumner suggested, and let mere words alone?" put in Mr. Bacon, who was already out of patience and was looking very austere. "You cry vociferously for cardinal points; I say the word Church is an important point. Perhaps you'll find this out befoie you desire it," said Mr. Weston, who was determined not to leave the word undefined. "Then, if you persist, go on; I know, however, that it cannot effect the tenor of this investigation," said Mr. Sumner, very reluctantly. e \     TMr. Weston obeyed. "To be as brief as possible, let us first determine the meaning of the word 'Church' from its derivations. I  "Church' is used to translate the Greek word-ekklesia into English. Ekklesia is formed of two particles-ek, out of-kales, to call; hence, the compound signifies the' called out, or to call out. Primarily, it means an assembly  called out by the civil authorities. In this sense it is so applied in Acts xix: 39. It also means an assembled congregation of the Jewish people, as in Acts vii:38.  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8270-00000043"/> 'V       aJDA J^UiD  A J n ,. Most generally, in the 1ew Testament, it means a spirit. ual assembly called out of the world to serve God, ' called to be saints;' ' the salt of the earth;' ' the' light of the world;  holding fovh the lamp of life;' 'a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should show forth -the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light." "This is a short compendium of the meaning of the word Church. The Bible itself defines it as applied to a Christian society. 'Called you out,' that is fron the world. Hence a Church is "1. A collection of people, called out, or taken from the general mass, and signalized by some conformity, or dis- tinguishing difference or differences from the residue. "As defineld by all lexicographers, and by sacred in- spiration itself. "2. Individuals capable of transacting affairs, or parti- cipating in the object of the meeting. "In this brief compilation-for I have been brief, gen- tlemen, for your -benefit-we find none are called but those who are capable of responding. None are called but those who are responsible should they not respond. Here, infant baptism finds a death-blow in the simple meaning of the word Church, as derived from ek and :ales, and defined by the sacred writings of inspiration." Mr. Sumner started when Mr. Weston concluded, and Mr. Bacon sighed audibly. Though they had regarded the simple word "Church" as not at all effective in any way to the investigation, yet its significance, together with the rightful application, sounded like anything but mu- sic to their sensitive ears. Mr. Bacon was the first to speak, having more assump- tion than prudence. "Would you exclude infants from the holy influence of the Church, by refusing them baptism?" "If the Church could have any influence on them, or if we had the slightest intimation of such an institution ever being in practice in the apostolic age, we would not hesitate one moment in giving them this sacrament; but as we are commanded to give this ordinance to none but believers, then we must, of a necessity, exclude all un- converted persons. ,!But, Mr. Weston, we have apostolic examples to that effect," pleaded Annie. *     *?'   ,Ti INVESTIGATION.        81' "As regards that, Miss Annie, we'll see to it in due time, that is, as the investigation progresses. I will prove to you, before we are through with this, that in- fant baptism is an institution of man, and that it is a sin to practice it, as no one has a right to introduce into the Church any change or rule; if so, men have a right to take the ordinances of the Bible and change them to suit themselves, which many have already done." "Gentlemen," interrupted Mr. Sumner, rising to his feet, "I cannot assist you in this investigation any farther this morning. I feel quite ill; will you excuse me for the present?" Certainly, certainly," said Mr. Weston, arising and approaching him. "You look very pale; be seated. Is there no stimulant convenient, Mr. Bacon?" , :  The latter was quick to give all possible relief, and in a few moments Mr. Sumncr was comfortably enveloped in blankets, with artificial heat applied to deaden the unpleasant sensation of a chill. Mr. Weston deplored the interruption of the investi- gation, but it could not be remedied. The day dragged away slowly, and evening found Mr. Sumner able to sit up, an event over which he did not experience much joy. Night slowly made its advent, bringing the, moon, which "rode high in the heavens," in grandeur of her solemn loveliness; no cloud dared to intercept her grace- ful rays as she swept the broad concave of the upper deepand motly panorama of the shadow indented earth. Hers was a mission to soothe, as were the stars, the :  vacillating little gems of heaven's expanse, which sparkled in their untented cavettoes, in mocking laugh- ter, and sportive twinkles, as the happy children of the dignified moon. Embedded were they so comfortably in the warm ether down, that as the eye was cast hither- ward, the scene but, brought to mind the nestling flock of some fond mother, reposing in the warm rays of her benignant smiles. Annie, as she threw aside the crimson curtain that shaded her sanctuary, could but lose all thought of self while gazing on "fair Cynthia's" form as she walked the heavens in such majestic silence. There is an influence-thrown only on those whose hearts are burthened-that steals its gentle way from the pla-  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8270-00000044"/> 82       L EANDER HALL. cid contour ot celestial bodies, down in the shades of earth, to the seething souls like oil on wounds fretted with fevers and crudy juts. It subdtqes the heat of pas- sion, quiets the turbulent fountain of the heart, and often tears unconsciously flow in holy unison with that lesson of patience, that the inanimate Creation bespeaks for its fellow handiwork of Nature. Lost in the contemplation of Deity's omnicience, Annie forgot for a moment the weighty thought that was wont to engage her mind, and yielded to the calling praisers aroi nd her, which drew forth a prayer of thankfulness instead of anguish appeals. Oh who can think of self, while all nature is so elo- quently praising the author of its existence? The in- sect, the bird, the waters, the land the forest, and "the Heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handi-work Day unto day uttereth speech, and night untonight showeth knowledge!" But to the scene. As before stated, the definition of the word "Church" had given rise to many thoughts in her hitherto unchal- lenged heart- Hear her reflections.  "It is all mystery to me. The Bible has defined it, (Church) the called out, as well as Greek Lexicograph- ers who have given us its derivation. But how can infants be called? Peter says: 'But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should show forth the praises of them who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.' Can children be called? called out of darkness into marvelous light? Call- ed to be saints? can children answer to that call? And if they are baptized and grow up in their sins, what right have they to be with the people that are'called to be" saints?I for Paul was certainly addressing the Church at Rome. 'Ye are the light of the world.' What light can children give to the world in their unconsciousness? There's a great mystery in it, and yet I'll let it alone, per- haps Mr. Sumner can straighten it to-morrow, or next day, Oh I long so much for an entire elucidation of this mystified subject!

By the next morning he was able to be up, and in the libraryto the furtherance of the investigation.  For his benefit only a few hours were appropriated to the cause, instead of half the day. Dr. Boon, who had realized his great wish, was again summoned out in the country. Mr. Bacon held a long talk with Mr. Sumner, prior to the assemblage of the amateurs, who gave a promise that nothing for the vindication of the cause espoused, should be left undone. Mr. Bacon was more hopeful, after this air-castle of promises was given him. It will be remembered, that at the commencement of the investigation, his policy was aggressive; but now, de- fense was as much as he dared think f.

The subject was "The examination of the Methodist Episcopal Church." There was no definite point in view, so he did not know what expediency to consider. Mr.- Weston, as usual, bore the burthen of opening the exercise. "Owing to the interruption on yesterday, there was no point brought up for to-day's employment, though, pre- viously, we concluded to look into the Methodist Church, and examine its creeds, which I presume, my friends, you still have in view. Am I right in coneluding thus?" "Of course," said Mr . Sumn er 'm er-willing for the creeds, articles of faith, or anything else pertaining to our blessed Church, to be subject to criticism." "But we are to examine your Church, having the Bi- ble as a key." "I have no fears, Mr. Weston. Many great and good men have approved of our system, and lived and died within the pate of our Church." . "Still, in this matter, that can have no bearing. We must take you as we find you, irrespective of men's opin- ions. The Bible must govern, and not great men. What subject is best to examine first, we must determine from this: "1st. We have found a Church in the New Testament, dating back to the days of JohnL the Baptist. "2d. We have found the Lord's Supper instituted in that Church, and practiced in that alone. "3d. We have found but ONE Church., "4th. Hence, no one has a right to commune, but a member of that one and true Church of Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, who is the head of that Church. "Now, what was a prerequisite to membership in that Church, as we first found it, Mr. Sumner? Your answer must decide our next point." Rest assured, reader, he did not make a reply without reflection, for he was becoming very suspicious. Mr. Bacon, seeing Mr. Sumier's hesitancy in answer- ing, presumed, one without thought. himself.   I     ^  THE INVESTIGATION.         86 "Why, Bro. Sumner, it's as clear as daylight. Can't yon see? Baptism, baptism was the first step towards the Church! And was certainly thefirst institution of the Church." "Excuse me, gentlemen. I was reflecting on the most feasible plan. I acknowledge that baptism was the initia. tory rite into that Church, and the first rite proclaimed by John." "Then," said Mr. Weston, " that must be the first sub: ject before us, to be' examined." "I very readily agree to this, Mr. Weston. Yea, Im more than willing, for it is a subject that I've often won- deied, why you Baptists and Reformers ould possibly take such notions of, when there are so many plain facts in the Bible, in direct contradiction to your avowed senti- ments."  ;  "Well, I'll give you my reasons in time. The word Baptize now comes as a preliminary. We must first de- termine the meaning of it before we can proceed." "Oh, well, that can be easily done. Here are several Greek Lexicons; you can decide for yourself. Take Don- egan first, which is among the most ancient." - And get- ting up, he handed Mr. Weston the book.  Mr. Weston ran his eyes over the pages until he came to the word disignated.  R "' Baptizo-to immerse repeatedly into a liquid, to sub- merge, to soak thoroughly, to saturate.'" "Don't he say 'to dye, to tinge, to pour?' asked Mr. Sumner, who had been under- the impression that the word was a generic term. "No, sir. Will you hand me Scapula, the great foreign i  lexicographer?" :  "Certainly; here is the book." I   '" ' Bapto, or Baptizo-to dip, to immerse; also, to dye.'" "I . Well, how do you dye but by applying the dye to the subject? . You can color by sprinkling or spnging in ap- !.  plication." "But you know that is not the mode of dyeing or col. oring. But allow me to read another, Henricus Stephan- us:'Bapto and Baptio--to dip or immerse, as we dip things for the purpose of dyeing them, or to immerse them in water.' He explains the manner of dyeing quite : j different from you. It is useless, however, to be quoting  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8270-00000046"/> 86       LEANDER HALL. a host of lexicographers who agree substantially in the same; but better determine the meaning from the Bible, since we resorted to it for the meaning of the word Church." "That's what I say. The Bible certainly tells us how to baptize. It's so plain that you can't mistake it. Bro. Sumner, get the New Testament. It is worth more than all the Donegans and Scapulas in the world. It tells us just how to baptize, and that is to ' sprinkle with clean water!'" and the old man manifested no little delight at resorting to what he imagined his invulnerable strong- hold. Nor did he like the sound of the definition given of the Greek word Baptizo. "Yes," said Mr. Sumner, "we can learn more fionm this book, (holding the New Testament in his hand,) as to modes, than from any other source." "I am quite willing to go with you there, Mr. Sumner, but you must take some definite grounds. You must either say sprinkling is the mode, or immersion. You practice both, but cannot doit with any consistency-for remem- ber, 'ONE LORD, ONE FAITH, ONE BAPTISM.' Or you may acknowledge as many baptisms as you please; but only prove that sprinkling or pouring was taught by Christ, or the Apostles." "That can be done easily, Bro. Sumner. Just show some of the many instances where immersion was impos- sible," spoke in Mr. Bacon quickly, in his perfect confi- dence. . Mr. Sumner began--the following being his first proposition: "' That tall the washings of the Old Testament, the modes oJ which were prescribed, were required to be performd by sprink- ling. The only possible exception was in regard to ves- sels.' * This, Mr. Weston, cannot be denied. In Levit. xiv, we find directions concerning the ceremonial cleans- ing of lepers. They are required to be sprinkled seven times, to wash their clothes, and thei wash themselves in water; but the mode of washing is not prescribed; noth- ing is said of immersion. Again: 'And for an unclean person, they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification from sin,.and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: and a clean person shall take hysop, * See Debate between Campbell and Rice, pp. 214.   THE  INVESTIGATION.       87 and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or a grave: and the cletin person shall -prinkle upon the un- clean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on ;i  the seventh day he shall purify himself in water, and shall e beclean at even.' (Num. xix 17-19.) Now it is evident, Mr. Weston, that if baptism by immersion,weiee practiced then, it would have been mentioned. So we must con- clude that sprinkling was the universal prescription throughout the Old Testament. Now all these washings were emblematical of spiritual cleansings-of sanctifica- tion. This is evident from the language of David i'I Ps. li: 7-' Purge me with hysop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.' What could you, Mr. Weston, or any other Baptist, do with this evidence, which is a mere beginning of the nmay yet in store?" I Mr. Bacon was elated with the young preacher's impregnable position. He rubbed his hands in ecstacy. Ad  How could  ir. Weston get around this point? And what would lie do if he failed? In his delight he forgot himself, gave his chair an tnceremonious 'whirl, stamped his foot, and then to indemnify 'Bro. Sumner' for his defense of truth and unresisted assault on Mr. Weston, he confronted him with a look of gratitude, plainly Qx- pressive of satisfaction. Annie wondered how Mr. Weston would extricate himself. She was a firm believer in sprinkling. She had often heard that, brought up as an evidence of sprink- ling, but had never heard it confuted. There had been previously in M---solme little dispute about modes be- tween the Campbellites and Methodists, but were of short duration as they both agreed in open communion. ,She could but feel sorry for Mr. Weston, yet truth must be vindicated at all hazards and sacrifices. So she thought. Mr. Sumner urged a reply, thinking Mr. Weston's hesitancy portended inability. "I was only giving your figure time to make a duo impression, Mr. Sumner, and then I intend making it applicable to my position." "You make it applicable?" exclaimed Mr. Sumner, who was surprised to think that Mr. Weston had so f                '   &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8270-00000047"/> 88       LtANDER HALL. much presumption as to take an unanswerable argument in favor of sprinkling and make it applicable to immersion! The idea was preposterous. "Yes sir, I'll make it applicable to immersion. It is a beautiful prefiguration of the sinner purified by the blood of Christ. The ashes of the burned heifer, and running water, are but types of the slain Savior, from whose side ran blood and water. These are the sources of man's purification from sin. The bath commanded was but the type of baptism. We all know that the Jews were in the habit of washing their whole bodies often. We also know that it is not customary to. wash anything by sprinkling, so we take the command there, to the unclean person as strongly prefigurative of the total immersion of the body in baptism. We know that the cleansing of hysop is a type of the cleansing of the blood of Christ, let it be sprinkled or poured, for, says David, 'Purge me with hysop, and I shall be clean.' If the purging of hysop is a type of the blood of Christ, then 'Wash mie, and I shall be whiter than snow,' must bi a type of the baptism which was commanded by our Lord Jesus Christ, and which is a representation of 'being buried with him"-a figure of his death, burial and resurrection. Draw your own conclusions my friends. We find that sprinkling or pouring of blood may do for the cleansing of the soul, but the type, the representation of the death, burial and resurrection, must be something else. 'Therefore we are buried with him (Christ) by baptism into death: that like as Clhist was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in nenewless of life.' This is incontro- vertible." Mr. Bacon wore deep wrinkles in his forehead, which, a few moments before, was Wreathed in smiles. His great sprinkllina foundation was about to give way. Wasn't there some other resort? He thought and bethought himself. Why didn't Mr. Sumner make some effort to redeem their ground? Perhaps he would. Annie broke the silence. "Oh well, Mr. Sumner, there are so many other proofs, this can be dispensed with very easily. Let it go for what it is worth." "So I think, Miss Annie. I will give the gentleman   THR INVESTIGATION.        89 another, which I predict he won't get around so readily. Now this:  That the inspired writers never, in a solitary nlstance, represent sanctification' by dipping a person. into water, either literally or figuratively.' " "That's so, Bro. Sumner. He can't get around that!" j  exclaimed Mr. Bacon, who had begun to revive a little. !   Annie felt re-established.. True, the rebutting of the first proposition did enmbarrass her a little, but the bring- ing forth of this re-instated her. ' The very point, Mr. Sumner, on which I desire to meet you. Since the word baptize has been determined on, I can prove the fallacy of your proposition very easily. 'And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be bap- 'i tized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.' 'Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life,' which is undoubtedly' to be dead j  indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord;' is not sanctification represented in the above by immersion or dipping?" "But sir, how do you make the sprinkling of hysop, (or the ashes from a heifer mixed with water,) a type of the blood of Christ, purifying the soul, and baptism by immersion a type of purification " "Well listen, and I hope it can be made plain. There are two dispensations. The types and shadows of the former, point to the latter. The cleansing of an unclean person possesses two distinct types, one the purification of the body by sprinkling, or the representation of blood. This first one is a prefigurement of the sprinkling of the blood of our Savior, which really purifies. The other type, which is the last, is represented as washing, or bathing, and is a prefigurement of baptism which the purified are commanded to receive. As to what that baptism is, let my quotations from Rom. 6: 4. prove. Now baptism in the, New Dispensation has had a type pointing to it, nevertheless it is a type itself of death, burial and resurrection, and-' newness of life.' ". "That explanation, Mr. Weston is plain enough to be understood by any one. I must confess, I never saw it in *8ee Debate between Campbelland hicee pp. 215. 8  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8270-00000048"/> 90       LEANDER HALL. that light before," spoke up Annie, who had been an at- tentive listener. Mr. Bacon gave his daulghter a hard look, and she re- lapsed into silence. A change came over the spirit of Mr. Sumner's dream.  A light was burning througll the scheme of Mr. Rice, fettered hitherto by darkness. But still there were other arguments he clung to. The' greatest morti- fication he experienced, was from the impression it had made on Annie's mind. He began to be fearful that the , whole scheme tinight thus be sifted and found lacking. However, he hoped for the better. "Is there no other evidence, Bro. Sumner, that you could bring up?" asked Mr. Bacon now, in a mournful tone..' "Oh yes, plenty, Bro. Bacon; just wait, here is a pass- age I think the gentleman will find more difficulty in getting clear of. This certainly haq reference to Christ's kingdom here on earth." "Read it quickly, Mr.'Sumner, I nm so anxious to hear it." said Annie who was still hopeful that hbr viws might be authenticated. "' Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you ;' (Ezekiel xxxvi- 25.) Now sir, if you undertake to explain this away, you had as well un- dertake to explaih the Bible away; the one is as easily done as the other. But let me read more. 'A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.' (26.) Here is the emblem, and the thing signified. The thing signi- fied is a new heart a new spirit-sanctification. Chris- tian baptism is designed to be an emblem of spirtual cleansing, and Ezekiel was right in representing sanctifi- casion by sprinkling." Mr. Bacon in the ecstacy of his joy, sprang to his feet and confronted Mr. Sumner the second time, this time giving his hand an expressive shake, in manifestation of his approval. The Doint was gained, so he thought. Yes there it is!-Sprinkle!-not dip as you indecent Baptists do! It's sprinkle!!--do you hear it, Mr. Wes- ton?" he exclaimed,stamping his foot. "What can you say to it? why, nothing but that Christ did sprinkler'   THE INVESTIGATION.        91 Yes, he plainly says, that in the day of setting up his Church, that-' Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you?' added Mr. Sumnet "Do you thilnk that has reference to setting up his kingdom, or Church here on earth, Mr. Sumner?" "Certainly it does!" "I differ with you. As you have the book, read the perceding verse, and those following." Mr. Sumner obeyed, not dreaming that any refutation  r was lurking beneath the exterior. "' For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into :-  your own land.' j  "Hold on one moment; Mr. Sumner. Whom do you I  suppose that God meant, by this address?" interrupt- ed Mr. Weston, Mr. Sumner ran his eyes over the pages rapidly, and then said- "The Jews, I suppose." !   "Then read on, holding that in remembrance." "' Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleans'e you. A new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. I will also save you from your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. And I will mul- tiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall recieve no more reproach of famine among the heathen. Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities, and for your abominations.'" "That will do Mr. Sumner. Yon have read enough to explain the nature of those promises. Now you admit that God was then addressing the Jews." "Yes, sir, he certainly was referring to-their dispersed condition."     .  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8270-00000049"/> 92       LEAND:ERa HALL.  "And you know, hehas never gathered them  from  among the heathen, and 'out of all countries' as yet."  No, I must suppose that, that promise is yet to be ful- filled."  -"S then, no reference whatever was made to the Church as set up in the days of the CQesars, as you are bound to acknowledge." Mr. Sumner looked blank! "Instead," continued Mr. Weston, "of referring to the establishment of the Church, it only had reference to the restoration of the Jews, which is another thing alto-  gether. Many have confounded this with the setting up  of Christ's Kingdom in his day, but there is not the least resemblance, neither can it be made to synchronize; for when that Kingdom was set up, the Jews were soon dis- persed to the four parts of the globe, and-have never been recalled to this day, for the indignation or the wrath of God, is not yet fulfilled. In time to come, God promis- es to recall them to their native land and -to his favor, for his 'Holy name's sake,' and then he promises -that they shall receive no more reproach of famine among the he- then, and shall dwell in the land of their fathers unmo- lested." i "(uGone, gone, gone. echoed the explanation oftthat passage. Methodists, Presbyterians, and all contenders for rantism have clung to it for ages as the great founda- tion of the -Pope's innovated mode, but now, since it is proven to belong to a period yet future, the dying spirit of its past existence,- reverbeiates the sound--"Gone!  golne! gone?" It is impossible to describe the wretched look depicted :  on Mr. Bacon's countenance. Mr Sumner changed his position in his chair thrice be- fore being" well seated." Who could wonder at the excruciated workings Of his countenance, when- the death-throes of this, great mam- moth of strength, was sounded? How often have we heard our Methodist friends proclaim that'"Christ fore- told by-the mouth of Ezekiel, that his people he would 'sprinkle clean water upon," but they never hinted that, that prophecy, had reference to the restoration of the Jews alone!                    . The light thrown upon this perverted text, by giving   THE INVESTIGATION.        93 its full connection, will expose that falacy for which so many have so long contended, and will sink it into the fossillated remains of time, as blazed like the burning me- teor, and died awaty without a sound. Mr. Sumner glanced -hopelessly at the chapter fromn which he had been reading, to Annie and then at Mr. Bacon, but he saw no rescue there. Mr. Weston was silent for a time, to give the applica- tioi a legitimate effect, and then spoke: "Since that passage ias reference to the restoration ot the Jews, then it has nothing to do with Christ's Church, nlo more than it has with the Mosque of Omar; then that 'sprinkling' has nothing to (1 with our baptism, for our baptism belongs exclusively to the Church of Christ, which found its origin in the far off wilderness of Judea, where Christ first said ' Sitffer it to be so now, for thus it beconleth us to fulfil all righteousness,' which was done, and our Saviour went strai ghtway out of the water, where God attested by his Spirit the Son's Worthiness." Mr. Bacon became desperate. "One more question," plead Mr. Weston, after a time of silence. "You believe, Mr. Sumner, that baptism is a New Testament ordinlance, don't you?" "Certainly I do," was the faint answer.  "Then why do you resort to the Old Testament for proof, to establish its mlode?"  "Because it is repeatedly prophesied of there." "You are mistakei. I know you have been accustom- ed to think that it was, but since It have removed the passage just discussed, you can find nothing thalt has the remotest resemblance to baptism. The visible Church, designated by baptism was something novel to the Jews,  for they claimed membership from their descent,- which was repudiated by John." IOh well, Bro. Sumner can afford to give that pas- age up, and proceed to another more incontestible," inter- rupted Annie, who w as becoming more-and more -interest- ed; and wished the advancement to become acelerated. "No I don't give it up, but I perceive it will do no good to argue that point with Mr. Weston.; he'll have his way any how, so I think, (he was getting very doubtful.) : I can bring up one now that will confound him."

What could he do?) We had better suspend the affair until in the morning. What say you to it gentlemen?" interposed the host. "It may be too great a test for Mr. Sumner's health so I judge you are right, Mr. Bacon," said Mr.- Weston. Mr. Siumner assented willingly to the plan, consequently the little group was scattered in a few moments. An- nie to her room, Mr. Sumner home, Mr. Weston also, and Mr. Bacon to his gloomy study, there to repose his head in his hands for the remainder of the day. Reader, a word to you now. The points brought up by Mr. Sumner, are the identical ones of Dr. Rice, the great Presbyterian (oracle, we might almost say) champi- on. In answering them, we. have not pretended to follow in Mr. Alexander Campbell's tracks, for they are deemed inadequate in many respects, but have made a thorough investigation of those points for ourself, hence the expo- sition given by Mr. Weston. The unfounded contexture of Mr. Rice, will be seen-the confounding of the "clean water" with baptism, by distorting passages, in separa- ting them from the elucidating connectiou, and in making them subservient to foreign theories. If to judge you by ourself, we presume, dear reader, that you are somewhat tired of theological discussion, so let us give you a page in life-a conversation which occur- red between Annie Bacon and her father, while at the supper table on the evening of that same day, in which the events just related, transpired. "I wish the thing was over with! it is a great source of annoyance to me!" exclaimed the old man, as he seated himself to his sumptuously supplied table. Annie sat mute for a moment. She knew that her father, was very bitter on the subject, therefore felt some- what unwilling to express herself. At length she ventur- ed to speak. "I too, am very anxious for it to terminate; don't you  think, father, that Mr. Weston is getting the best of it? -"No; I am not like you-I do not suffer myself to be gulled by every seeming show of argument. I have more f irmness than that. Weston, I tell you isquibbling!" was the old man's rough response. "Well, why does Mr. Sumner let him quibble? Why don't he keep him to the point?'   THE INVESTI-GATION.    -   95 "It's this much, Weston is so persistent that he will have his own way." "Not without your consent, has he chosen, or taken any course, that I know of, has he?" she asked, rather asserting the question. "Well, he has managed by some trickery to get around us. But this is the way with that sect, they always want to, and will rule:" replied the father with energy. "Yet I cannot see when, or where, he has used any de- viee that I could perccive of; if he bhas, I think I would have detected it at some time" pleaded Annie. "You detect, the mischief! You don't see through it like I do. It's an up-hill business, (perhaps it had been to him.) I thought it would have been done with, long ago; but you see Weston has to go round the world, to prove that close communion is right, and he won't do it then, you mark it!" "But don't you think, father, he proved satisfactorily that it, (the Lord's Supper,) was exclusively a Church or- dinance, and that none but members of the Church had a right to commune?" Well, I'd like to know who ever said that it was not a Church ordinance?" "But he proved that there was but one Church." "And I reckon that Mr. Presumption will have the as- surance to say before the thing is done with, that that Church is the Baptist?" he almost hissed, as he cast a 'frowning look on his daughter, the first she had received for many a day. "I don't know " said Annie, who was afraid to venture much farther, "I think perhaps Bro. Sumner may be able to bring our Church out clear." '8 "If he don't, it will be his fault, for I know the proof is in the Biblej" and the old man came down on the table  with such a violent blow with his fist that the transpa- rent china started up a cry and the table gave signs of spiritual rappings, or something that approximated very closely to that mystery. "Well," said Annie, "if our (ihurch does not stand the test of the Bible fairly, I shall forthwith leave it and seek membership in that Church which does, wherever it may be,"  "And if you go at any such foolishness, you leave my ,   &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8270-00000051"/> )6       LEANDER HALL.  house, for I will never have any one about me, who takes yp for these bigoted Baptists, and their forbidding Dreeds." he exclaimed, as he whirled his chair around. "But, father,-" Not another word about it. If the Methodist Church is not good enough for y6u to live in, then ]et all Church- es alone." "But if the Baptist Church is the true Church of Christ,  must I remain where I am and-"  "I'll hear no more about this, I tell you! Thousands  of as good people as you, have lived and died in the  Methodist Church. I tell you, lo daughter of mine shall ever be dipped into close communion, while I live! If you choose this, you must choose a home elsewhere, for-" There were still harsher words lingering on his lips; but he paused ere their expression. Annie's meal was cut short. She arose and left the table, vainly endeavoring to check the tears that were coursing down her cheeks. She stole quietly to her room, which was already sha- ded by the progressing twilight, and threw herself on her knees. Her humility could not command prayer, how- ever, for the fountain of her heart was so completely stir- red, that thoughts of devotion were overwhelmed with sudden grief. 'Such harsh words had never fallen on her ears before, nor had such talons ever been clutched in her heart as on this occasion.   CHAPTER tX.  THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, IN WHCH IT IS PROVEN THAT "We are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been PLANTED together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection." Rom. vi: 4. 5.  -      ' MORN in her blooming robes, sings of night. Joy, in her effervescing bliss, whispers of sorrow, and life, es- cutcheoned with the mark of time, even dreams of  death. Then security knows nothing but an evanescent being, and that cotemporary with forebodings of some- thing worse to come.  One might say that Annie Bacon was happy-one who glanced ,at the exterior, he who measures happiness by the comforts of life-but let the metaphysician trace the shaded lines of the disrobed countenance, reflecting the innate feelings, and what the result? Ah! though   - life had showered her clustered boons of wealth, of lux- ury and fortune, there was an unvoiced impress of future sorrow, so slight that the resolute heart might have ban- ished it without a thought; but not so with Annie. She yided to the fact that "Joy in her effervescing bliss, whispers of sorrow." There was a cloud that shaded her soul in spite of the sunshine bought by circum- stances of fortune. Such shadows invaded her i:nmost sanctuary when she arose the next morning, after spend- ing a restless night. As the day began to throw into ler room a fountain of light, Annie began to recall the incidents of the former day. The turn of the -investigation, the conver- sation with her father, and an indefinable something, she could not tell what, but oh! a cloud, a dark cloud, was gathering, that caused a gloomy feeling to succeed the first consciousness of the glorious morn. 9                          .  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8270-00000052"/> 98       LEANDEB   HALL. Ieader, did you ever yield yourself to the forgetful atrs of Morpheus, with an inseparable companion of mystical repres&amp;etation enshriniing your helpless heart? And on the morn, the type still haunting the soul that courted obliviousness of this unwelcome visitor? Did you ever try to shake those feelings off' by a recapitula- tion of what gave them birth, all the while essaying an effort to find a plea against such intruders, but feel worse than before? If so, then your experience gives credence to my unpleasant recital, and demands a listening ear of patience to this digression. Annie, as she descended to the dining room that morn- ing, wondered what prodigy had invaded her once happy natural to bar out the sunlight from her soul. Her usual vivacity, the dancing smile and, buoyant demeanor had been obscured by some invisible portcullis, shutting out her wonted spirit of joyousness. Her father had preceded her to the breakfast table. A cold "good morning" without raising his eyes, was the only salutation or welcome she received. An invol- untary shudder passed through her frame. She seated herself and bent her eyes on her plate in melancholy si- lence. Would be not make some remark?  Would he breakfast without' noticing her presence more than a cold gooed morning?"  The coffee was handed, yes, and drulik, and no word uttered yet. Breakfast was late; a few moments and the amateurs' would arrive to prosecute  the investigation. The father still silent and austere; what a miserable day opened itself before her! Annie Bacon had never known such. Indulged in every wish frQm her earliest recollection, petted and carressed,n- shackled by parsimony or subjection, this trial, thrice told its weight, on the susceptible tablets oi her heart. Breakfast was soon over, and yet no recognition came, nlly the formal " good morning." Tears began to swim in the soft blue eyes like liquid diamonds. This emotion, however, must, be overcome, or what would be the con- jecture of the little party when assembled? Mr. Suttnncr would'trace the troubled look to the real cause, for he had already some misgivings. When Mr. Bacon left the dining-room, Annlie immedi- ately repaired to the sanctuary to indulge in the only so- lace that many a poor woman can only possess--tears   THE I NVISTIG ATION. Yes tears, the heart's relief, tears, the drowner of many troubles; tears the cooling draught of the thirsty soul- the inheritance of the softer sex-consequent to for- tune's frowns, they soothed that restless spirit of poor Annie, wohen she wept her content. "But such a plight for company!" was the exclamation called up by the colorless cheeks and swollen eyelids, as she glanced at herself in an opposite mirror, before start- ing down to the library to meet the already congregated "searchers of Truth." A slight hesitancy, a short and fervent prayer, and a ! nlment's reflection, completed her preparation for ap- pearance in company. Messrs. Sumner, Weston and Dr. Boon, had arrived. Though the usual members of the group were present, no one had as yet, ventured to introduce the subject. Mr. Weston was awaiting " the other ingontestible points" with which Mr. Sumner was to favor them, and which Mr. Bacon imagined would make the Baptist preacher a mendicant for mercy, before the "thing was through with." Previous to the convocation, Mr. Bacon had inquired into the argument which Mr. Sumner was to bring up, and pronounced it "gool." Tie, like many other mem- bers of the Methodist Church, did not know why or wherefore they taught this or that, but left the matter with their preachers, or itinerants, they to the Bishops and Presiding Elders, and so on, until the highest authority holds the will of men subservient to its notions. When a move was made for a beginning, Mr. Bacon showed evident signs of satisfaction. He was indeed hopeful. Mr. Sumnner broke the silence, in which there hadl been many ahems and much hitching of chairs. "You remember (he cast a sly glance at Mr. Weston) my friends, that wre left off at a very important point y es- terday morning. I was about to introduce it, but the conclusion of you all was that it was best to suspend until this morning. By the way, I think a very provi- dential notion, for we have now Dr. Boon (turning to hiin) as an additional witness of the evidence which I shall bring up in defence of my position. I hope also to convert him to my side, for I am going to bring up a point, or proposition, that no one has ever dared to 'I  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8270-00000053"/> 100      LEiANDER HALL. answer in my presence. Mr. Campbell, .in his debate with the celebrated Dr. Rice, failed to answer this with any due satisfaction. I presume sir, it is acknowledged as an incontrovertible point, and if you fail to answer, you must give up your vulgai notion of dipping, for it does away with that entirely. If this remains unanswer- ed-which I presume it will-it will establish my position without any recourse to the many other points that are in store for your benefit. However, when you fail to answer this, if you will give up your traditional notion of baptism, I will agree to let the question pass for what it is worth. If, on the other hand, you still persist,I will not spare you." Mr. Sumner delivered his oration with much confi- dence. The company were on the apex of anxiety. Dr. Boon had never .heard of that great "incontro- vertible point"' so, as a matter of course, he was on the qui vice to hear it." "I think," said he, "if I mistake not, gentlemen, your subject now is baptism. You knowI I was unfortunately (inwardly, fortunately,) called off yesterday, and on Mon- day also; therefore I am not posted as to the advance- ment of this investigation, (he began to think strongly that it was a discussion,) so you can excuse me for my ignorance." "Yes sir, the subject is baptism, and we regret that you were not here on yesterday and the day before, to hear the points discussed," said Mr. Weston, who knew that calling attention to the fact didl not bring up any pleasant recollections to Mr. Sumner and Mr. Bacon. "But the 'great point,' let Bro. Suniter bring it up gentlemen. I want you all to be convinced and have it over with," persisted Mr. Bacon, who was fearful that delay might cause the interest in the "great point" to die out. Mr. Sumner cleared his throat preparatory to reading, holding the while the New Testament in one hand with his thumb inserted at the General Epistles of John. There was a silence so profound that the breathing of -'each individual in the room was audible.  Mr. Sumner read:  "7he work of the Holy Spirit, of which the baptismal t water is an emblem, is called a BAPTISM. Paul to the .   T " Jli 1 N V ES TIG 1 A T I U N .  LVL Corinthians says: 'For by one spirit arc we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether  we be bond or free.' From this, the evident conclusion must be that baptism of water represents that of the Spirit, which we are told, is'shed forth' and 'poured out,' then the figure must be carried out by sprinkling or pouring of water, or the former cannot represent the latter. John says: 'I indeed baptize you with water; He (Christ) shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.' Both are baptisms; now how were the Apostles on the day of Pentecost baptized? Were they immersed in the Holy Ghost, or was it 'poured out' on them? You must answer this, Mr. Weston, or you fail altogether." Dr. Boon was astonished. He had never heard of such argument before in favor of sprinkling. There was a gleam of hope that shot across his brain-a hope that Mr. Sumner would be too much for the Baptist preacher. His darling wish was that close communion might in some way be put down, and thought that this argument might help to stop the mouth of the heretical  preacher. Men's prejudices and fanaticisms will at times lead them from truth and justice, a course, which at other times, would be revolting. Dr. Boon thong. an immersionist, hailed the apparent triump hof Mr. Sumner with joy. Should we wonder at this,when the avowed object of the anti-close communionist was the putting down of the anti-Christian principle, as they called close communion? When Mr. Sumner read his " incontrovertible point," he laid the scrap of paper down which he held in his hand, and awaited an answer with no little degree of composure. Mr. Bacon, who had learned not to be too sanguine over seeming proofs, only manifested his delight by a joyous twinkle of the eye, and a confident shake of the head toward Mr.'Weston, as much as to say: "Answer that if you can!" Mr. Weston seeing that an answer was expected from him, betook himself to the task. "To answer your proposition, Mr. Sumner, I must first  ask y6u some questions. Do you believe that the Holy  Spirit was designed for, the body, or the heart?" " "[  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8270-00000054"/> 102      LEANDER HALL. "For the heart! Why who could doubt that?" "From the application you have been trying to make, [ should judge that you doubted it! However, I will make the matter plainer directly. As the Holy Spirit is designed for the soul, is it impossible that the heart be immersed in it, though it be. poured out from heaven? The heart is thoroughly changed by the Spirit, an effect which sprinkling cannot represent. When John said that 'I indeed baptize you with water, that fact pre- cluded the necessity of Christ's baptizing the body any more; but the heart--with what? The Spirit. Although  the Apostles had been regenerated, had' been taught to love and confess Christ; yet after his departure, a sup- plemental degree of the Holy (Ghost was needed to com- fort and to endow them with the power of proclaiming the Gospel with different tongues, or inl many languages. And this was given them on the day of Pentecost. Whether it was sprinkled or poured on them, we will  not say, but this we do know, that each onei was so com- pletely metamorphosed that his native speech was eradicated, insomuch that they spake with other tongues, losing consciousness of their Jewish descent. If sprink- ling can represent this effect, we have no more to say." "Bu you will admit that it was poured," persisted Mr. Suliner. "And so was water from heaven, of which rivers were formed- in which John, the, Baptist, baptized! The Spirit, which is not material, is represented as changing the whole heart. Sprinkling could never do this. We know that the Spirit of God so filled the disciples on the day of Pentecost, that their inner man was spiritualized so completely, that they became miracles in the sight of the populace, when this renewing of the Holy Ghost was received. Now what is the object of .God's Spirit? It is to the sinner to bury in oblivion his former sins, by the radical change of the heart, and which is like the figure,' buried with him in baptism,' and raised with him (that is, from sin,) through the faith of the operation of God! Then if this spirit is. designed for the heart, can any one but agree with Paul-'Ye are not in the-flesh, but in the spirit'? If in the spirit, then the heart must be considered as immersed in this holy influence." "And yet Mr. Weston, you will acknowledge that the   TUE INVESTIGATION.       103 blood is poured out, the spirit is also poured, and baptism, their type, should correspond?" "I make no such acknowledgment. The shedding of the blood is never represented as a baptism! It was poured literally in a conceivable stream, but the design of the blood, and the design of the spirit are two very different things. The blood was an atonement-a liqui- dation of debt, a reconcilement of God to man, not a re- concilement of man to God, for it was not God that transgressed but man, hence the debt was to God. Now X  since the blood has appeased the wrath of God, and as man is still in the bonds of iniquity, and the gall of bit- terness, there is something yet lacking to draw him unto God-there is something lacking to change that vile heart. What is it that God has provided?  The Spirit of God which immerses the heart-changes the heart radically, wholly, totally and thoroughly: ' or by one Spirit are we all baptized (not sprinkled into, nor poured into, for the verb musthe followed by the sub- stance, which is the one that is baptized, so you cannot say sprinkled,for you cannot sprinkle a man into anything nor can you pour him into anything; but you can nim: merse him into the Spirit .or into Water,) into one body,' (that is, one Church.) The people ot Jerusalem and Ju- dea and round about Jordan, could they have been sprinkledin Jordan?!!! What! sprinkle a man into any- thing? They could have been immersed into Jordan. Hence when John said that: 'he shalf baptize you with (or into) the Holy Ghost,' he must have meant that Christ would baptize the heart into the Spirit." The exposition cast rather a gloom over the high ex- pectations of Mr. Sumner, but he had another resort for the establishment of his proposition.- "Indeed Mr. Weston, you have given a very faithful expose, were it not for another infallible and unanswera- ble argument which I have." "I am ready to hear that argument at any time, Mr. Sumner, and any other that you may have on this point. Be quick in your delivery, for there is yet a great deal to be learned about this matter."'            i "To corroborate the proposition which I brought forth a while ago, allow me to read from- John v: 8. ' And there are three that bear witness in earth,.the spirit, and ]]]  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8270-00000055"/> 104       LEANDER  HALL. the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.' Now, as the blood is represented as thqe' blood of sprink- ling,' and the spirit represented as ' shed forth,' or poured, and ia water baptism is an emblem of the spirit baptism, then the agreement is strikingly exhibited-' agree in one." "But Mr. Sumner, you cannot possibly mean that the three are represented as agreeing in modes." "Well, what else?" I am aware that that is a point which has'caused many to stumble-many who are ignorant, and do not under- stand the design of the Apostle. When that proposition was first brought into notice, thousands of sprinklers, or pourers, sought it as a refuge; many, very ignorantly thinking that the agreement consisted in modes, but few, very few understanding the agreement to consist in TESTI- MONY. In answering the previous proposition, I answered that. The argument of the first is the same as the last. "As the blood is represented as poured, and the Spirit also, you make a necessity follow, that the water must be poured, to agree in form with the pouring of the Spirit, which is a representation of baptism. I have answered 'that proposition in the one preceding. "1st. By proving that the Spirit was designed for a radical change of the heart, which mere sprinkling could not represent! "2d. That we are described as being in the Spirit; that is, our hearts immersed in its influence. Sprinkling or pouring could not do this! "d. Man can be baptized or immersed into anything, but cannot be sprinkled or poured into anything! Hence, if Spiritual baptism must agree with water baptism. it must be that of immersion; the blood being unnecessa y in any such consistency, as it is never represented as a baptism! "But to your last, proposition, more fully. The three that bear record in heaven-the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost;' they only testify of him 'that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ.' Also the witnesses in earth-'the Spirit, the water, and the blood'-they only agreein one testimony, viz: That Jesus is theChrist, the Son of the living God, the Saviour of the world. No referenee is made to modes, but to the agreement in testi-    TEE  INVESTIGATION.       105 m6ny! Now it reads: ' If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness 6f God, (the things just mentioned,) which he hath testified of his Son;' that is, they all testify that Jesus is the Christ." "Well, it's no use to argue with him on that point, Bro.. Sumner. Quote some plainer passage in the Scriptures, which proves that sprinkling or pouring were unquestion- ably the modes practiced by the Apostles," said Mr. Ba- con, mournfully, for he saw that nothing was to be gained by protracting the one under consideration. "I am hot done with this, Mr. Sumner," interrupted Mr. Weston. "You must acknowledge that sprinkling and pouring are not synonymous terms. I know they are often used alternately, but they are of a different character in the application; the simple fact is, one is sprinkling, and the other is pouring. If I tell a servant to sprinkle clothes, must -he understand me to pour water on them? Most assuredly not; hence the difference."' "Even admitting your theory, I cannot see, Mr. Wes- ton, what it can do for you in argument."  "It does this much. If the blood is represented' as sprinkled, so must the water and the Spirit! though we know the Spirit is never represented as sprinkled, so we find a gross inconsistency in your two modes. If you carry out an agreement of figures, the latter must be the same as the first; in this it will not agree, since the Spirit is never sprinkled. A lack in one principle portends heavi- ly of a lack in another. Even according to your own opinion, the two modes cannot be used alternately, tor in the former you cannot, carry out the figure; so much you say in your own argument; in the latter mode I con- tend the figure is not correct. "One word about the Spirit being poured, and I air done. When God, through the prophet Joel, used the term pour in connection with His Spirit, it was not to de- signate application, but a 'season of refreshing'! that is, a time of abundant mercy. Hence, the significance oi 'pour' as used in the Acts, was the time when God by  His Spirit chose to gall many to repentance! The phra- seology was designed to denote something strong; that is, a time when grace was more abundant. If you have any more argument, bring it up, Mr. Sumner."  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC8270-00000056"/> 106       L'EANDER HALL. Mr. Bacon, being uneasy, pleaded Mr. Sumner's ill- liealth as an excuse for a suspension, which was consid- ciied, though Dr. Boon demurred, alleging that he might oft have the pleasure of being present on another occa- sion, soon. CHAPTER X. THE BOAT RIDE, AND THE INCIDENTS CONNECTED THEREWITH, IN WHCH DR. BOON BECOMES STRONGLY EXERCISED, BE- CAUSE "Perfect love cast th outfear."-1 John iv: 18. ANNIE Bacon stood on the front balcony, viewing the river, and watching the bright sunset as it traced a ricl design in gold and crinlson, on the gorgeous drapery of the west. It was, indeed, a glorious sight; the beauty of the landscape-enhanced by the tints of the slanting sun- beams, seemed in happy concord with the radiant splen- dor of the celestial world; for as the sun charily with- drew his rays, heaven, lit up with this borrowed bright- ness, appeared to grasp for a moment, double adornments, and bind them to her brow.  The young girl' stood there contemplating the attri- butes of Deity, while a sad look stole softly over her lovely countenance, when in the train of unpleasant recol- lections of the past events, circumscribed to the last few days, loomed up the father's austere mein, the lover's fur- tive glances, together with other sad circumstances, all helping to give shade to the picture. "Oh that my thoughts could be as bright as yolnder sunset!" she exclaimed, casting a'wistful look at the de- parting king.   TIIE INVESTIGATION.       107 "They were once, but Annie, after sunset, shades began to gather," interrupted a sweet voice at her side. She quickly turn ed about, and Mollie Weston, with a deeply sympathetic countenanlcc, stood by her. Aonie's mind had been so absorbed that she did not hear the light footstep as it tripped up the ungraveled path. A tear glistened on her cheek, gilded by the bright reflection of the departing sun. Mollie bent her eyes on hei, full of pity. "What! in tears, dear Annie?" she exclaimed, throwing her arms around the weeping girl. "Oh it's a weakness, dear Mollie, to which I yielded. Come, don't let us think of it; it only makes us sad-;" A  and she brushed that crystal intruder from her face, and made a strong effort to choke back the rising emotions that swelled lher bosom. -When she saw such deep com- miseration in Mollie's eyes, the flood in her heart heaved until it was about to rend the bounds, but its cause-the unpleasant recollections attached, prompted her to stifle her feelings, and she hushed the passion without utter- ance. When our hearts are bursting with grief, unused to compassion, then should some angel come to weep with us, to share our sorrows, what an alleviation it would be! But Annie did not realize this boon. Although she saw in Mollie a friend, yet she dared not utter her confi- dence, for the nature of her grief was such as to forbear revelation. "Whlt is it, Annie? Tell me, and perhaps I can be of service to you," pleaded Mollie, in deepest pity. "It is nothing, Mollie, but weakness. Please don't talk about it. -Tell me why you did not come over to- day? and why you haven't been to see me before this?" she asked rapidly, wishing. to draw her attention to some- thing else. "I have been very busy, Annie, helping sister Eva off to school. Pa has kept me posted as to the progress of the investigation." "But you haven't been here since the day on which he made it appear that-" "I know where they were when I left them," she in- terrupted. "What do you think of the ground that they have traveled over since I left?"  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC8270-00000057"/> t08  '    LEANDER HALL. "Indeed, Mollie, I am undecided-that is, there is some light thrown on points which I could not discern before; still there is mystery." ( Well, I want to say, Annie, I hope you may be made to see the matter in a proper light. It is a thing of vast- ly more consequence than many imagine. Weas a de- nomination, have been unmercifully assailed, and even persecuted from the days of the Apostles, all because we have adhered strictly to the teachings of out Saviour. It seems that every missile that could be gathered, has been directed at us, and all for conscience-sake. Oh I do hope the day may speedily come, when we can shine forth in our true light. Yet in recounting these misfortunes, An- nie, I can rejoice when I remember that our Saviour- has said: ' Blessed are they which are persecuted for right- eousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."' "True, very true Mollie. And yet I am not wholly convinced. I still have hope that the Methodist Church is the only true Church in existence. I cannot believe that there are a plurality of true Churches, nor do I be- lieve that any Church has a right to the ordinance of the Supper, or that of baptism, but that true Church which Christ saw complete before he left this world. He cer- tainly -left one visible form of government, and that con- sisted of his commandments; then when he said,' If you love me, keep my commandments,' it was .equivalent to 'If you do not love me, do not keep my commandments. I have no claims on you. Certainly, every Christian will try to do as he has commanded, that is if he is properly instructed; if not, he does not love Christ, consequently ia no true Christian. Is it ppssible to suppose that one : who loves our Saviour with all the heart,would willfully set at naught his commandments'? or let prejudice or ties, of consanguinity influence him from his duty? Ah, :it is collateral with the betrayal of our Lord and Master! and let every Christian examine himself thus: ' Lord, is it I?" "Your philosophy is good, Annie. I'm glad to see you untrammeled with the principle that has debarred so many from doing their duty." "And yet, Mollie, I have done what I've conceived to be my duty." Have you no doubts, Annie?"   aI     THE INVESTIGATION.        109 "I must confess I have sometimes, but I hope they are ill-founded." A crimson hue mantled her cheeks. That was the source of her trouble-the doubts expressed to her father, which met such a reception, of which the reader is al- ready apprised. "But can you believe, Annie, that our Saviour was baptized by immersion, and then commanded baptism by sprinkling or pouring?" "Do we know that he was immersed?" she asked with some surprise. "We know this much, Annie, that he was 'baptized of. John IN Jordan,' and when 'le was baptized, went straightiway OUT of the water,' and we know that the prim- itive meaning of the word baptizo is to immerse, so we must conclude that Christ was immersed in the river Jor- dan; and if he commanded baptism, it was in the same form he received it; so let the blame rest on those that disobey, and not ile. I do not mean to say that bap- tism is essential to the soul's salvation, but is essential to make an obedient Christian, for how can any one be called a Christian if he does not follow Christ? It is a com- mand of our Saviour, that is sufficient for me to know. Then it is not the Christian's principle to obey from fear, or in order to escape punishment; nor to elicit the encomi- ums of men, but. because he loves Christ, and wants to act in obedience to his commands. "I agree with you in the latter clause of your argu- ment, but the first notion advanced, I cannot say that I concur with you altogether. Were there not so many improbabilities of baptism being immersion in the Apos- tolic acts, I might more easily embrace your theory. However, when a full elucidation is made, I can then con- clude.. While I can give you my hand in love, dearest Mollie, yet I believe that you are in error, and hope, you will be convinced, before many days.' Now, I want you to promise me that you will attend, our investigation, for the points to which I had reference, will be brought up and discussed. Will you be here, Mollie? I am so anxious for those that are in error to be convinced now. You will come, won't you, Mollie?" she pleaded. "Yes, Annie, but I am fully established in my faith. I have read the Bible for myself, without commentaries  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8270-00000058"/> "O       LE ANDER  cALL. or instructors, thinking if it testified of Christ, it must be plain enough for me to understand, if not, I could not be responsible for error." Annie blushed, for she remembered that she had read the Bible in connection with Clark's commentaries alto; gether, and had trained her minid to a concurrence with his. She also remembered that several passages attract- ed her attention as being inconsistent with his theory and she had gone to Mr. Sumner for an explanation, but he had put her off with the excuse that Dr. Clark under- stood it better than he or she ever could, which struck her then as being a system very nearly allied to vlcege- rency. She did not make any comment on'the lastre- mark of Mollie's, but thought none the less. Just then the supper-bell rang, and the subject was abandoned. Mr. Bacon had already taken his seat at the table when the girls entered the dining room. He deigned a very slight rise from his seat, in acknowiledgement of Mollie's presence, but gave no further signs of civility. A cloud was very apparent on his brow. Annie saw and felt the effect. Supper was taken in silence.    ' Dr. Boon and MAr. Sumner called to pay a short eve- ning's visit, after tea. They did not know Molhe was over at Mr. Bacon's, but had made an agreement to either go over after her, or spend the evening with her, provided Annie should acquiesce. It was indeed very opportune that she happened there, for Dr. Boon, like most of young men, felt a slight repugnance in visiting the house of a preacher, especiallyone as old and dignified as Mr. Wes- ton, and characterized by such peculiarities. Mollie Weston's beauty was enrapturing. Her's was not beauty that consisted of sameness or symmetry, but a source of alternate admiration, and of intoxication to the lover who is moved by impulse or feeling. Dr. Boon drank in the captivating spirit which was emitted like the elect'ric spark from her lively counte- nance. he was no sycrophant, but his eyes, and even his actions betrayed how deeply his heart was fascinated, and how her image was deified in his soul. Ah, love! what an irresistible charm! and yet the stoic tramples it under his feet as a mere whim. Are we ceitain that it is not?   THE INVESTIGATION.      .  ll Time answers. Moments may calculate, but the hour sums up the aggregate. But to return to the story. A few moments and the group was divided into two companies. Annie and Mr. Sumner had sought the cool air of night, and the soft smiles of the full moon, while Dr. Boon and Mollie occupied the parlor, engaged in an ani- mated conversation.  "This cloud, Annie, what is it? There is something the matter. The last few days your countenance has been so sad, that one might imagine you had lost every friend on earth. Tell me, is it anything thatI've said or done? If an offence of mine, I am willing to make every repara- tion, or concession necessary. Now confide in me, I beg you: From what source is this melancholy look?" he beseechingly asked, as the pale rays of the moon display- ed the sadness of her countenance; and fell in sparkling mockery upon recreant, tears which had gushed from the fountain of her heart, touched by the unpleasant remi- niscence. Annie was silent. "Is silence all I deserve, Annie? Then'I must con- elude it is something that I've done," he added in a mournful tone, "Oh, no, not at all, but you myrst excuse me, Mr. Sum- ner from an answer. If I know the cause myself, it is as much. You have not said or done anything to offend me. We all have our shadows in life to contend with; I sup- pose this is one of mine." "Then it is a mere ' shadow, which has never been known to harm any one, though it is said, 'Coming events cast their shadows before them,'" he-remarked smilingly, dropping some of the melancholy of his voice. "It is indeed a true saying) though I hope it won't hold, good in this case. But to change the subject, isn't it a beautiful night?" It is, indeed, and one well suited for boat-riding. How Wvould it do to gather up our company and enjoy a sail in the little barque of Mr. Stevens?"  "It would indeed, be delightful, if Mr. Stevens is at his post," exclaimed Annie, glad of the refuge. The thing was decided with Dr. Boon's and Mollie's approbation. Dr. Boon was sent in advance, to notify, Mr. Stevens of their coming.  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8270-00000059"/> " .     LEANDER Hatl. A few moments more anld the little boat was travers- ing the limpid waves that fretted the surface of the beau- t iful Ohio. Each tiny ruffle, reflecting the moonlight, seemed a glittering jewel on the fairbosom of the stream. "What if some huge packet should upset us with its monster waves, before we-could get out of the way?" sug- gested Annie, who before, had had some experience on that score. Such unwelcome predictions Miss Annie, are out of place," said Dr. Boon, gaily. And yet, Dr. boon, I could predicate my fears on ex- perience." ," And fulfilment too, I am afraid, for I see the smoke of the Merrygold, round on the bend yonder, approach- ig this way. We will either have to pull up to the shore, or move in double quick across, to reach a safety in time, observed Mr. Stevens, hurriedly. "Which shall I do, gentlemen?" Oh, let us cross, we may have to wait here an hour! persisted Mollie without awaiting the gentlemens de- chion. "I say so too. It will take the river so long to get quiet, or still enough for boating," joined in Annie. . Our judges have laid the decision before you, .Mr. Stevens let us try at least, we may make a clear chevi- sance of it yet. Pull hard on that side and keep the oars to the left! Lay to there, Mr. Sumner, it is all for life!"And Dr. Boon cutthe waves as vigorously asan ex- perienced hand. Now this happened to be one of the wide points of the river, so before the skiff was half way across, the uncooth waves of the Merrygoldwere felt sen- sibly, for she was already driving, like a mammoth, the furious waves, threateningly in the face of our little crew. It is generally known, that riding the waves left by a large boat is a dangerous enterprise, and seldom done only by those who are adepts at swimming, for life is liable to be forfeited at any moment. Our little pleasuring party soon became cognizant of their critical situation, resulting from this. Their cries might attract attention from the boat, but in all proba- bility, before assistance could be had, it would: be too late. The hazard was becoming more and more immi- ,nent, which manifested itself in the countenances of   THE INVESTIGATION.         113 those who were called to experience such frightful con- sciousness. Cannot the skiff be pulled back?" asked Dr. Boon imploringy , after' perceivi!.ng their (dan er. "Impossille! inTpossible, ilr! We cnr do nothing but trust to PrIovidence," answered XIr. Stevens in a despon- dent tone.  "I sa we   m'.s! do something else, or we will perish. Wlhat? b'o dtrifited aboutl h]ere on the henavinig waves which threateni to swallow us, like mere automatons, with- out making an .ffort to save ourselves?" "You must lpereive Doctor, that our strength is already expendled to no effect. If it is the will of him who rules the storm, and pours the flood, as it were, , 'from the hollow of his hand,' if it is his will that we should perish, we ought praycrfully to submit, remem- bering that he loves his chldren, and our love in return should be so perfect as to cast out all fear. This is the kind of love the Christian ieels--te 'perfect love' which' casteth out fear. And why do we dread death, wlhen He chooses to send it? Have we not given ourselves to Him? He who watches the little sparrow will not neg- lect hi, children in time of. peril, if it is not His will that they should perish. Though we may be swallowed in these waves, Christ can call us up at the resurrection   morn, as well as if yonder cemetery held our bodies in some decayless coffin," pleaded Mr. Sumner in solemn tones. "Mr. Sumner, this is tantalizing! I say we must ise the oars or we are gone! What? die here in sight of oull homes?" he exclaimed with his whole body envel- oped in a tremor. He seized an oar which had been abandoned, and began a struggle for life. : Mr. Stevens begged, yea pleaded with him, but to no ef'fet. At last he caught the tearful and pleading eye of Mollie Weston, and quickly yielded to its controlling power.

We can do nothing but trust to Providence. "And die here!" he ejaculated mournfully.. "Let us pray," ro e the voice of Mr. Sumncr above the roar of the splashing waves.  Dr. Boon bowed mechanically. A mystery-an inex-    i plicable event! He could not account for the resigned  I reliance that characterized the whole party but him- self.  In pleading tones which none but those chastened of God, Mr. Sumner approached the throne of mercy, oily0 beseeching resignation to His will. Oh, the Spirit of  God!-where is the place He cannot visit? Can storms,  can dangers, can death or power, ard Him, off? No: for He has visited the "seven times heated furnace, and has wrenched open the jaws of death, and snatched'its vie-  tim fronm hence. And so did He visit the lapping waves  of peril and afforded a consolation to those who looked death in the face as their inevitable doonm. Mr. Tnm- ner's prayer ascended, and God 1hea(trd the supllication and came to their rescue. The little bark was at last enabled to gain the shore in safety, after riding each surge of the turbulent water  which the plowiug steamer had caused.  The company hastily returned home, each one breath-.  ing a prayer of thankfulness for the timely and miracu- lous deliverance from the gaping jaws of death. Mr. Sumner sought Mr. Bacon's room immediately, and gave- him- a deseription of the adventure, but the old man was too morose to take any interest in the affair. -Nor could -he be aroused until tie events of the morning were referred to, and then he rallied, but not il a spirit of pleasantry.  4"I tell you sir," said he risilg to his feet and confront- ing Mr.- Sumner, ' if there is not somethng done more efdectually to-morrow, we had as well give up the thing. You must bring up more conclusive proof, or that quib- bling fellow will just have the matter his own way." "But what can I do, Bro. Bacon? I havebrought up as strong argument as we have in the Bible; can I do more?" l tThat is none of my look out, it is your place to de. fend the cause," he replied, petulently.  rt           THE INVESTIGATION.        115 Mr. Sumner, seeing that further conversation on the subject would do no good, took his hat and left, upon making a few courteous remarks which were not at all appreciated. Dr. Boon, after seeing Mollie Weston home, hastily sought his little office, there to be a prey again to the in- trusions of doubt, which-kept him company in times be- fore. In spite of an effort to banish these thoughts, the sen- tence "perfect ove casteth outfear," would haunt him witl fears of his probable error. A thousand times he thought the Christian should not dread death, as Christ had died for him, but to himself he could not draw such feel- ings, for the spirit of misgiving would envelope his heart, shutting out all resignation. Oh, if "'perfect love cast- eth out fear," what kind of love did he feel, when in im- minent danger, he could not rely on God's will and promises? Reader reflect. Do you possess such love? If not, oh tire not until you do! for this love beto- kens the new birth! (1 John, iv: 7.) CHAPTER XI;.

Mr. Bacon still wore his cluster of frowns. He had giveun the youngp preacher to understand 'if he did not do better the day vrwas gone. ivMr. Bac6in was certainly expecting more than was in thecBible. In short, his cont-mentaries bad assured himl, and not the word of God. Mr.' Sumner opened the exercise by saying: "A   hen we suspeuded on' yesterday, I was about intro- ducing somnie very etrong proofs of my position--prcce- dents of the Apostles. No1w, Mr. Weston, were it not for these fiacts., ou might establish immersion, but these are obstacles around whhich you cannot get.

"That is the first account we have of it?" "Do you believe that Jolhn baptized with one baptism, and the Apostles with another?" 'I cannot-say that I do. We do not know that they all baptized with the same baptism, but must think that they did." "Certainly: 'One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism.' We cannlot suppose that the term baptize applied to but one mode, or why was Paul so xc plicit in saying; 'one bap- tism'? But now to aniwer your questio). You say that no minister or Christian is ever represented as going after  water. I say there was. John, we are told, baptized at IEuon, near to Salimn, because there was MUCH WATER  there '-equivalent to goingl i search of water!' "But it is doubted whether that is Christian baptism or 1not."  "It might be by a Camnpbellito, but you who contend so strenuously for identit of Churches, it strikes me as being a very gross il'consistency. The Campbellite con- tends there -was no Church established until on the day  of Pentecost, but you do not; so you will admit that those whom John lbaptized, were baptized into the Church, or your scheme of Clhurch identity must be hopelessly  abandoned." .  Mr. Sumner could say nothing to this.  "Even grantinOg you that Christian baptism did not begin until after the resuirection,yol must allow that of John's to be the sanme as to mode, or how would the Apos- tles ha ve Understood Christ when he said, 'Go teach' uand 'baptize'?

Mr. Sumner felt that his proposition was wholly wrest-  ed from him, with all of its echoes of false impressions. The same dark cloud enveloped Mr. Bacon's brow. He  i seemed so provoked at the young preacher, that he would not look at him. "I have answered your point," continued Mr. Weston.  "I have proven that a ' minister' is represented as going  after water, because there was much water there.!fitwer- sprinkling, why would not a mere bucket or basin full do? But no: John goes where there is much water, in order to immerse, we must inevitably conclude. But we've  said enough on this. Bring in some more evidence of sprinkling or pouring. "I will, sir. There is yet, more incontrovertible evi-  dence to bring up. On the day of Pentecost it would have been impossiblefor the Apostls (being only twelve), to have  dmmersed the ' three thousand souls' that wlere added unto them on that day, as it requires some time to immerse an indi- vidual, while to sprinkle, or pour, would or could be done in half the time." "That's so, Bro. Sumner! I knew there were proofs, but could not think of them,",exclaimed Mr. Bacon, de- lighted to hear something that he imagined incontestible. "Not so fast, Mr. Bacon. Let us examine into that more closely. We read of other Apostles being there, besides the twelve. It is said that there were an hundred and twenty disciples present; so we must conclude that the seventy were there, which Christ ordained and sent out during his ministrations on earth. The twelve added, would make eighty-two, allowing thirty-six applicants to each administrator, with -thirty-eight the remainder. Even allowing themr only two hours, they could easily  have baptized that number, for I have seen one preacher baptize over thirty in half of an hour. But 'we must conclude that there was more time than that, as Peter began his sermon about the ninth hour, and it could not fiave taken him more than two hours for delivery, which brings us to 11 o'clock in the morning, which would have left over half of the day for the transaction. But laying all this argument aside, the twelve Apostles could have done it in that time themselves, as we all know; for when the preliminaries to this ordinance are over, a great many can be baptized by one man in a few minutes."   THE INVESTIGATION.        119 Mr. Sumner did not object to this elucidation, for he perceived at once its reason. He only proceeded to an- other point-equivalent to an acknowledgement that the one just cited could not be counted for him.  "There are yet instances which go to prove that some other mode of baptism than immersion, .was practiced by the Apostles." "You have only to cite them, Mr. Sumner," said Mr.  Weston. "Paul, we are told, was only commanded to 'ar',w' when he was baptized! Could he have been baptized by  immersion?"  "TNo no, Bro. Sumner, that he could not, but lie ws-v sprinkled or poured on, as a great many. now-a-day arc, who prefer rising to their feet,"'chuckled Mr. Bacon, ini perfect delight at the contemplation of this new hople. "From the-premises you present, sir. I argue that ifi Ananias had intended to sprinkle or to pour water MoI Paul, or if it had been customary, why the necessity of: arising to the feet? The water could have been brought to him, for cither, but to immerse, it was necessary tfor limn to ARrsE. Allow me to read it with your velsionl: 'And now why tarriest thou? Arise and be sprinkled, and wash away thy sins,' or 'arise and be poured, and wash away thy sins.' As I have before told you, the sub- stance must follow the verb, which in this case would have been Paul. What, sprinkle Paul! Can a man be separated into particles, so as to be sprinkled!! Or could sprinkling or pouring represent washing away sins? But if' we read it thus: ' And now why tarriest thou? Arise alnd be immersed, and wash away thy sins ;' then the sense is good. Arise, does not denote the termination of actionl. If I say to a servaht, 'arise and attend to your business,' must I be understood that he must merely stand up to 'obey me? Most assuredly not. He is under an obliga- tion to act after arising, and so was Paul. The simple action of standing on his feet did not terminate his duty. any- more than the servant who, in order to obey nme must arise and attend to each calling of his business, if it be that he go ten miles for the accomplishment thereof.  Though Paul was merely commanded to 'arise and be  baptized,' yet he was necessitated, as was the servant, to - go any distance, or any where, to perform any amount of ? *i  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8270-00000063"/> 120      LEANDER HALL.  labor, if he obeyed the command. I hope this explana- tion is satisfactory. If not, and if any one wishes to urge any objection to it, I am still willing to discuss the point." 'I am certain, Mr. vWeston, no inprejudiced mind could find an objection to the view you have taken," re- marked Annie, before she bethought herself. For this concession she received a stern and reproving look from her father, and one of pain and surprise from Mr. Sumner.. To mollify the case she quickly added: "If that were the only instance proving that immerslion was impossible, we might come over to your views, but there are yet pas- sages which you cannot controvert. Are there not Mr.. Suniner? This has been my impression, any how." "Oh yes, Miss Annie, we are not near done with Mr. Weston yet. He has forgotten about the jailor who was baptized the 'same hour,' which wtas at night. Now how could he have been immersed at night, and in the house, and a jail too? Would Mr. Westotn hve tat a fountainh of water gushed out in the jail as from the rock ETebronfbor that purpose? I have heard such fancied notions advanced," saidjthe young preacher with rid- icule. "I think, Mr. Sumner, upon a more careful reading than you certainly have been in the habit of giving, that we will come to a different conclusion." "Why, Mr. Weston, I've read the chapter more than an hundred times, and carefully too, and I have never been able to see anything but that the jailor and his fam- ily were baptized, then and right there." "Well, allow me to read it and note changes as we go. Please hand me the New Testament. There it lies under Orchard's History of the Baptists.,' Mr. Sumner took the book and found the place, and handed it to Mr. Weston. 'And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword and would have killed limself, supposing that the prisoners had fled. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we 'are all here. Then he called for a light, and sprang in, (so he was not sleep- ignin the cell,) lnd came trembling, and fell down be- fore Paul s4 iilas, and brought them out, (they are   THE INVESTIGATION.        121 brought out: to where? let us see,) and said: Sirs what must I do to be saved? And they said: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. And they spake unto him, the word of the Lord, and to all that were in the-house. (Then he brought them out of the prison into his /ouse.) And hle took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; (he takes them somewhere,) and was Iaptized, he and all his straightway. And when he h had brought them    into his house," etc. So when the 'took them' he must have taken them from    his house, to wash their stripes and to be baptized, or he could not have brotqght them back. If sprinkling were in vogue, or pouring, why did he not call fori abasin of water and a vessel in which to wash their stripes . We find that the facilities for baptism were not in his house, so they were taken from it; wherej-ve cannot say, though many suppositions have been advanced. However, it does not necessitate me to prove where they were bap- tized, but only that I should prove immersion not impos- sible, which I have done; I have proven that they were brought out of jail to the jailors house, and then taken from there to have their stripes washed, and to bap- tize the jailor's family. You have the matter before-you, my friends. You cannot prove that they were baptized m the jail, for the jailor 'brought them -out.' You cannot prove that they were baptized in .the jailors house, for he 'took them' (that is from his house, where he had brought them,) to some place to wash their stripes and to be baptized, and then he ' brought them into his house' again, and 'rejoiced' we are told. As to where they were baptized, letit be conjectured; I have only to prove that immersion was not impossible. More than that, I've clearly shown that it was more than probable, since the baptism was not performed in the house, nor can we say that it was in the jail. I leave it with you Mr. Sum- ner to contradict, if you can prove otherwise, but it can- not be done from this sacred bodk." Annie looked astonished. This to her had always been represented as one of the strongest proofs in the Bible, of immersion being impossible. Old Mr. Bacon's chair was not at all comfortable, for no position seemed to suit him.

He had learned a lesson from this experience, which was, to be silent, the best policy. He gave a footstool, on which he had been resting one of his feet, a nervous shove,:;breathing the while a very deep sigh, and mandu- ating his jaws, either in unrest, or to be re-assured of the quid that was in the mouth. Mr. Sumner felt like there was only one step more to take when his faith would be either confirmed or greatly shaken. One more passage to establish his position, if that should fail, his scheme would be left without sup- port. Mr. Weston anticipated him. "You have one more reference to make Mr. Sumner, and you are through. And that is: Moreover, breth- ren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the soa: And were baptized unto Moses in the cloud, and in the sea,' this is your last resort, make what of it you can." "I can make this much of it Mr. Weston, that the baptism here spoken of could not have been immersion, since they were riot made wet bye their passage through the sea. We are told that they passed through'dry shod. Now how could that have been immersion?" "Impossible! impossible, Bro. Sumner! Mr. Weston had as well let that go, for no one will believe that they were immersed, though baptized," said Mr. Bacon some- what revived at this last hope. "But I say, gentlemen, it was not impossible that im- mersion was referred to." "Well I'd like to know how you could twist that pas- sage in accordance with your theory. If you do, Ill give up," said Mr. Sumner, very confidently. Well let us see if we cant make it a figure. It strikes me that a wall of water on each side of a person, and a cloud over him, could not represent sprinkling very forcibly, nor could it any more represent pouring: now I would ask what else than immersion it would represent? I think the figure is so plain I need not enlarge on it. What do you think about it, Mr. Sumner? Could it rep- resent sprinkling?"  "I cannot say that it could," was the crusty reply.          . -a  ,'!   W j JO  A i V .1 3  A IS A .  A V ,  d(Lq "Could it represent pouring!" "Well-it does not look like it much," he stammered.  "Then I ask you candidly, what does it represent, if it refers to baptism at all?" Mr. Sumner hesitated. He was confused. "I want you to tell me, Mr. Sumner, right here, what you think of it, whether you will concede that it repre- sents immersion or not?" I must say, Mr. Weston, if we regard it as a baptism at all, it must be that of immersion, for if it had rained on them, as some contend, they could not have gone through 'dry shod' as the case was. Neither would the 'sea' have been quoted as constituting a part of the bap- tism," responded Mr. Sumner, honestly. , Yes, and let that answer serve henceforth and forever as a concession against sprinkling and pouring."- "But'Mr. Weston, while I admit that much, it does not follow that sprinkling or pouring are not valid. It's of no consequence any; way. It is not essential to salvation." "I'll notice that point directly. Allow me to bring up some infallible evidences of baptism by immersion. "John the Baptist baptized nw the river Jordan. Christ was baptized IN Jordon, and came STRAHTWAY OUT OF THH WATER." "But he might have been sprinkled, nevertheless," per- sisted old Mr. Bacon. "He might have gone down in the water and John sprinkled water on him." "Oh well, Mr. Bacon, if we go into 'mights' he might have had his feet sprinkled instead of his head. What authority have you for pouring water on the head, any more than the feet? The precept is as clear for one as the other. Who told you to sprinkle the head? Is the head the seat of affection? Where did you get the prac- tice."' "It was handed to us by our fathers," replied Mr. Ba- con, with some pride. Which is nothing more than 'tradition of men' against which we are warned. However, 11ll tell you in time to come, where the practice started. Let me first look into the evidences of baptism by immersion. We will merely cite those instances which positively say that - baptism was IN water. 'Then went out to him Jerusa- will'rnerely cite those instances which positively say that,  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8270-00000065"/> 124       LEANDER  HALL. lem and all Judea, and all the region round about Jor- dan, and were baptized of him (John,) IN Jordan.' 'And Jesus when he was baptized, went up STRAIGHTWAY OUT O THE WATER.' 'And there went out unto him (John,) all the land of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him IN the river Jordon.' 'And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John IN Jordan, and straight- way coming UP OUT OP THE WATER. 'And John also was baptizing in XEnon, near to Salim, because THERE WAS MUCH WATER THERE.' Next reference to the mode, we have the case of Philip and the Eunuch, 'And they went down both into the water, both Philip and the Eu- nich, and he baptized him. And when they WERE COME UP OUT OF THE WATER, &amp;c.' We find that though Luke was silent as to -the modes in the evangelical history, he re- deems the testimony of the other evangelists in his Acts. These are the references as to mode by the four writers of the history of Christ. Let us look further. Paul is very explicit as to mode. 'Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus, (that is into. the faith,) were baptized into his death'? (the consequent of death being a burial.) Therefore. we are BURIED (the consequent of death,) with him by baptism into death, that like as-Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father, even so we also should walk in new- -ness of life. For if we have been PLANTED together in the likeness of his death,'-which by the way must have been immersion-' we shall also in the likeness of his resurrection.'-Rom. vi: 4, 5. Again: 'Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operations of God, who hath  raised him from the dead.--Col. xi: 12. (The passages referred to, prove conclusively that im- mersion was the proper mode. But allow me to substi- tute sprinkling in a few instances, and I'll give you, Mr. Sumner, the privilege of substitutimg immersion in any passage throughout the scriptures, that has reference to baptism, and if the sense is not good, I will give the thing tip. Here, you take the book first, and find the places, and read them all and change baptize, or baptism to immersion, in any passage, and if the figure is nol -good I will suspend." ;      '"    .  -    THE INVESTIGATION.       125' Mr. Sumner hesitated. He had seen that tried before, hence he did not like the experiment; so Mr. Bacon took it into his hands. "I'll take you there, Mr. Weston, if Bro. Sumner won't. Listen: 'I indeed immerse you with water. He shall im- merse you with the Holy Ghost.' Now the idea of using 'with' to denote that mode is very ludicrous to me." "And yet Mr. Bacon, if John did immerse, do you believe it was with water or sand?" "Why, Mr. Weston, what an irrelevant question. Of course he baptized with water." "Just so. John used the term with to denote-the dif- ference between water baptism and the baptism of the Holy qhost. The with could not mean mode. If I tell a servant to wash my clothes with water instead of ley, what would the preposition with mean? Simply to de- fine the kind of fluid in which I wanted my clothes washed. He is not to un'derstand me to apply water to them by pouring or sprinkling, but to immerse them in the fluid designated, instead of the ley. Hence the use of the 'wit.'; so it was as proper for John to say'I in- deed immerse you with water,' as it was to say 'I indeed baptize you with water." Every instance in which the preposition with is used, it is employed to designate a difference between water baptism and the Holy Ghost, and in no instance has it the slightest reference to mode. But we must hurry on or twelve o'clock will be here be- fore we are through." "It is near twelve now," interrupted Mr. Bacon, eager- ly, for he was anxious that it should close. "I know, but I must take the privilege which was granted you just now, viz: The substituting of different modes instead of the word baptize. 'Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan and were sprinkled (dr poured) of him in Jordan.' 'Johhf did sprinkle (or pour) in the wilderness, and preached the sprinkling (or pouring) of repentance for the remission of sins' ' And there went out unto him all the land of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all sprinkled (or poured) of him in the river of Jordan.' 'And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazereth of Galilee, and was sprinkled (or poured) of John in Jordan, and straightway coming up out of the  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8270-00000066"/> 126      LEANDBR HALL. water, c.' 'And John also was sprinkling in .Anon, near t6 $alini, because there was mtuch water there.' 'And they went dowi both into thewc'tter, both Philip and the eunuch, and he sprinkled (or poured) nim.. And when they were come up out of the water, .e'. 'Know ye not that so many of us as were sprinkled (or poured) into Christ Jesus (!!) were sprinkled (or poured) into his death?(!) There- fore, we are buried with him by sprinkling (or pouring) into death (!!) that like as Christ was raised up trom the dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.' 'Buried with him in sprinkling or pouring)!!) wherein ye also are risen up with Him.' o be brief, I have only selected a few passages, for it is getting late. The word baptize is not used throughout the New Testament but what immecrse could be substi- tuted without any incongruity or solecism. But on the other hand, sprinkling can be used with sense but seldom, while all references to mode are in favor of immersion. I have not time to enlarge on these points, nor do I pre- sume that it would make the matter more compre- hensible." Mr. Bacon looked like he had lost every friend he had on earth. He kept silent, only now and then slightly clearing his throat, which somewhat relieved his embar- rassment. Mr. Weston awaited some comment, but hear- ing none he spoke again. "Shall we dismiss the subject for the present, my friends?" "Yes sir, and for this week, (he would have liked to have said forever,) as to-morrow is Friday preceding our quarterly meeting, consequently a fast day,3' said Mr. Surnner, who previously, had been so engrossed apparent- ly with his own thoughts, that he had not remarked or. Mr. Weston's last arguments. "Then," suggested Mr. Weston, " as we have not found sprinkling or pouring as baptism in the Bible, let us next week find out where, and when it started." This was provoking, but 'the young preacher had to assent, for he did not want it to appear before Annie that he was afraid to investigate the matter.   CHAPTER XII.

Mrs. Stantord, Mrs. Grover, Miss Matilda Lankinston and the first-men- tioned, formed the notorious phalanx, by which the de- merits of M--. were discussed.

Don't you think so sister Stanford?" asked Mrs. Crow turning from Miss Lankiston to the lady addressed. "What is it Sister Crow? I failed to hear it. Sister Grover and I were engaged on another subject," quickly asked Mrs. Stanford, with the real essence of curiosity vibrating the nasal twaug of each tone of her voice. "Why, Miss Matilda is going to join our Church next Sabbath! Won't it make a certain Baptist family in this town feel badly? I am so glad of it," she rejoiced. "Andso am I Sister Crow. It is the very time she ought to attend to that duty. Since they say (but I doll't believe it) that Bro. Sumner was used up this last week, in his private dispute with that Baptist preach- er; I think the members of the Church ought to rally around him, and let the Baptists of this town know that Mr. Weston is not an oracle for us at least.

I am going to get Bro. Sumner to open the doors of the Church before the congregation has time to break up, and I'm going to request baptism right there, so as to let the Baptists know that I don't like them." -  "Capital idea Miss Matilda!"And Mrs. Crow began to rock herself violently, while the chair groaned under the weight of corpulency imposed.

It is a wonder that you have not joined before pow, Miss Matilda; what has detained you?" "I verily believe Sister Crow that it was Providential, for 've never thought about joining until now. Bro.

"Well! well!-did you ever? What? Annie Bacon that simple child, disagree with her superiors in knowl- edge and understanding? Well, what will the world come to next?" "I think sheis very presumptuous. Why, who is bet- ter. qualified to understand the matter than Bro. Sumner? He does nothing but study. We pay him to investigate the subject, what business is it of ours to be dictating to preachers what is right, and what is wrong?"And Miss Matilda gave her head a toss of gratification, incident to her when pleased with anything. ( Look at the clock, Sister Crow, and see if it is not twelve?" said Mrs. Standford, who was tired of fasting. "No, it lacks thirteen minutes. Shall I order some- thing to eat now?" "Oh no; let us wait the expiration of the time allotted. When we assemble at love-feast, I want my conscience clear. I want to tell our brethren that I've fasted and prayed according to custom and the Discipline. Don't you, Sister Crow?" "Oh yes, Sister Standford.

Church! Set apart for prayer. How did our friends spend it? This is a lamentably true sketch. According to promise, Mr. Sumner called to see Miss Matilda Lankinston. Shall we attempt to describe Miss Matilda's feelings, as she shook hands with what might be denominated a beau? Her hair elaborately arranged with additional braids-her teeth in perfection of white- ness, that reflected much credit to the dentist's art, cor- responded well with the artistic fairness of her youthful complexion, while graces in abundance were assumed for the occasion. Miss Matilda wished to be as impressive as possible. We don't'blame her. "Bro. Sumner," she began, "I have at last conceived it to be my duty to unite with the much-loved Methodist Church. (A sigh.) I want to live in a more active and useful sphere. The world lieth yet in wickedness. I would like to be instrumental in helping (oh how she dwelt-on the word 'helping'.) to convelt it. I can do a nothing while I'm in the world; that is, identified with those who serve mammon. I want to unite with the Church, Bro. Sumner, and then have some useful occupa- tion pointed out to me. Can you assist me?" She cast her eyes modestly to the floor, and suffered a bright tinge to suffuse her cheek. "Well, Sister Matilda, I'm glad to see so much interest manifested in the cause. I hope the Lord may abun.. , dantly bless your. labors. As to joining the Church, I re- joice, more especially, it being at the time it is. I hope you may prove faithful to the end." "Thank you, thank y9u, Bro. Sumner. My greatest prayer is to be useful." And she cast a furtive glance at him of some significance, which the young preacher failed to notice. Mr. Sumner did not tarry long. "I hope to see you at Church on Sabbath next, Miss Matilda," said he, as he took his hat to leave. Shei fol- lowed him to the. door, with a "D o come, Bro. Sumner, often. I:wish to be advised. You know I have no one in whom I can put implicit confidence." And she cast her eyes on the floor again, very meaningly. When Mr. Sumner bowed himself out of Miss Matilda's company, he bent his steps towards Leander Hall, as was   THE INVESTIGATION.       181 hi; wont.. There had not been any disagreement, between him and Annie, as was reported, only the conversation coming from the burying, the week previously; but do not,. deull reader, understand that Annie had endorsed Mr. i  Sumner's argument. No. When she saw it sifted, she counted it but chaff, yet she did not venture her opinion since the reproof given by her father. i    .ltc walked in unannounced, for he saw Annie sitting at a window inl the parlor, occupied with a book. "What, reading?-I warrant Madame Southworth's latest novel. No, as I live, it is the Bible!-and without a Commentary! Why, Annie, you can't understand it without assistance! You should not puzzle your brains at such vain attempts." And he attenpted to take the book, but she only held it the inore firmly. a   " "Well, let me see, at least, what portion you are read- ing. Why have you marked that place?" ( "Oh, I was but considering the importance of obeying our. Saviour's commands," she answered, blushing deeply. "Well, read the verse." "'Ifye love me, keep my commandments.' Don't ! -  you think that every one that loves Christ will keep his commandments?" "Most assuredly. They are at least under a strong ob- ligation to do so. Now I've just been to see a lady who has neglected to obey Christ for several years, that is, of identifying herself with the people of God. She seems truly penitent for her error, and'I am happy to say, that she will unite with us on next Lord's day." ?   Annie looked at him in astonishment. A change had come over her since they held a private conversation. Must she speak? or must she keep silent? She decided to do her duty. She looked him fth in the face, and asked: "Mr. Sumner, can you believe that she is doing right in joining the Methodist Church?" "Miss Annie, what do you mean?" "Do you believe that the Methodist Church is the true Church of Christ? Do the Methodist obey the Scrip- tures?" "Well, Annie, I must confess, this is unexpected. You'll go hand in hand with Mr. Weston before long, if you travel at the ratio which you have been doing the last three or four days."  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8270-00000069"/> 182       LEANDEBr HALL. "But you have-not answered my question. Don't you confess that there is a great defect in the Methodist Church?  i As to defects, Annie, all Churches have them, but as to great defects, that might be termed a mooted question yet to be decided. As I've said, all Churches have their defects, as far as the imitation of the Divine model goes. Allow me to amplify. The Baptist Church professes to be a model of the Divine original, but you see it ignores some of the practices of the primitive Church, such as infant baptism.- It cannot be disputed, (though some have presumed to do so,) authentically, but that infants were baptized in the first days, and ever since, though you know the Baptists don't practice it now (did they ever?) at all. This is a defect of their Church. Now as to the Methodists, they admit that baptism by immersion is valid, but since sprinkling can be traced back almost to the Apostolic age, and since there are so many prece- dents in the Bible that bring us to the inevitable conclu-, sion that sprinkling, or some other mode of baptism be- sides immersion, was practiced, they (the Methodists) practice different kinds of baptism, just as the recipient chooses. Some may call this a defect, but I think it is well grounded." "But, Mr. ,Sumner, I think Mr. Weston has proven conclusively, that but one mode of baptism is taught in the Bible, and that is immersion." "Well, we could grant him that, and then present a Church as clear of defects as the Baptist. Did I not just mention one prevailing lack on their part?" "If infant baptism is taught in the Bible, then they do commit a sin in not practicinjg it," she conceded. "You must 'know, Annie, that it is taught in the Bi- ble, or why have so many of our learned fathers contend- ed for it, and believed that it was an institution of the Bible?" ",I can't say, Mr. Sumner, but it might be possible that they were mistaken too. Dont you think so?" "No. Men that have studied the Scriptures all their lives, have a better right to judge of these things than we." ' And yet I think, Mr. Sumner, if the Bible were de- eigzed for the human race--and if they be culpable if ,   *          THE INVESTIGATION.       188 they don't obey its commands-I think it must be plain enough for them to understand and obey, as far as the re- quisition goes, without the aid of great men." "There's where you are mistaken, Annie. Christ left expounders of Scriptures--those to whom he intrusted the oracles, and it follows that through successive ages there must still be those who understand the word of God, in order to enlighten others-those who are not capable of understanding for themselves." Annie reflected deeply,  "I want you to give this matter deep thought," said he, seeing that she was becoming very much engaged. Well there is some plausibility in what you have been saying, and yet I wish you would practice the mode of baptism that is taught so plainly in the Bible, and let sprinkling or pouring alone," she said. . By that, Annie, we would be giving countenance to an anti-republican sentiment; that is, denying people their choice in these things. Now the Baptists have a prescribed pattern, by which their members are all meas- ured, prohibiting the right of conscience, for which our forefathers have struggled so hard. Every man has an inherent right to choose in these matters for himself." "It seems to me, Mr. Sumner, that the commandments of the Bible have nothing to do with civil liberty, or re- publicanism, as far as the rights of men go, in the choice of modes, or the manner of worship. God has laid down a rule in his book, by which we are all to be governed, and we have no right, in the sight of God, to choose any other form of government in his Church, in modes or in anything else; hence the grants of civil liberty have noth- ing to do with the manner in which God's people wore     ship." "Then, Annie, according to your theory, you would prohibit men from worshipping God according to the dictates of their consciences."  "Not at all. -You misapprehend me altogether. The Church and State have nothing to do with each other. As the State rules its affairs, so let the Church. The Church has no right to compel men into its government, but those that belong to the true Church of Christ, have no right in the sight of God, (they may be granted that right by State government,) to choose any other form-of  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8270-00000070"/> 134       LEANDER  HAALL. government, or mode of worship, than that prescribed by God; or else the commandments of Christ are all generic, and subject to the whims and schisms of men to change as they please. Every man that professes to have been 'born again,' is obligated by a command of Christ, to obey the rules laid down in the Bible; he has no right, in the sight of God, to say how he will obey, since there is but one plan. This is my conviction, Mr. Sumner; one in which I am established and firm. If Christ says we must baptize infants, we have no right, in the. sight of God to exclude them, though our civil government may grant us the privilege of doing as we please; but we must remember that that is not a right granted by God. If Tbaptism by immersion is the proper mode, then we have no right, in the sight of God, to substitute any other, though civil authority may grant it. If we have, th]en we have a right to substitute any formula for-baptism. There would be no prohibition or end to the extent of innova- tions. In short, we might have-as many modes as subjects, If we grant each subject the privilege of choosing modes." "Well Annie, 1 declare!-you are as close and as un- charitable in your notions as Mr.--Weston himself could be, Where did you get that'doctrine from?" "-ot from Mr. Weston, I assure you. It has'always been my honest opinion. If it is Baptist-ology, I did not knowr it. I think it could but commend itself to every one's judgment, if the mind is untrammeled by prejudi- ces or fanat i cisms." "I hardly know on what grounds to meet you, Annie. Are you a Methodist or a Baptist?" "I am neither, Mr. Sumner, if you represent the two Churches aright. You show a very striking defect in both; I know that the Church which Christ saw com- plete before he ascended -on high, had no defects in it; I want to- find that Church. It cannot be the Methodist Church, for you acknowledge' that it does not strictly regard baptism as to modes, and I cannot think that Christ commanded but one mode. It cannot be the Bap- tist Church, for you say it neglects to admit infants in the Church, which if a divine institution, its violatioh, is sacrilege, or worse if possible, so I do not know where to find that Church. It cannot be the Episcopal order, for that Church like the Methodist branch, baptizes by   !/*      THE INVESTIGATION.        185 sprinkling or pouring. And so is sprinkling acharacter- istie of many other factions, of that order. I cannot think it is the Reform Church, for it is in practice the same as the Baptist, so I'd like to know where that Church is." "Well, Annie, let me advise you as a friend, and one who feels as deeply interested in your welfare as any body could, (he attested as much, by a look he gave her just then,) give yourself no further uneasiness on this subject, for I tell you, iniformed, you will never find that true Church of which you speak. All are more or less affected with some schisms." "Why, Mr. Sumner, you don't mean to say that that Church is extinct? "The original model is, certainly. That is, there is pervertion in every branch of the great family of Christ, more or less, and now it is for you to choose the least evil. Remember, I don't mean to'say that the schisms that have grown up in the Church preclude salvation N o; not at all. Now, just so our salvation is sure, why should -we care for externals!" "If I remember aright," responded Annie, "Christ has said that the gates of hell should not prevail against his Church, so I must conclude that it is not extinct and never has been. I want to find that Church, for 1 am sure it is in existence, or I must doubt Christ's words. I cannot concur with you that just so our salvation is sure we should care not for externals. No, never! I tell you that it is not the principle of a Christian. If we love Christ, we ought to obey him, in every precept, command or example.  Not to escape perdition, but because we love him, for 'Charity doth not behave itself unseemly.' Love to Christ will lead any one to true obedience of his command, regardless of policy. Don't you think so, Mr. Sumner?" "Its no use to argue with you, Annie," he answered evasively. Seeing that she would not be satisfied with that reply, he added quickly: "you are not posted on this subject, therefore you should not meddle with it." She took the reproof silently, but did not cease to philosophise, at every opportunity she received. -The Sabbath morning of the Quarterly-meeting rolled around in the fullness of time.

Not as warm as was wont,,but the atmosl phere was as heavily ladened with the rich perfume ( blooming vegitation, and the skies as radient with th gorgeous robes of the guilding sun,as ever. Each breez seemed to bear a wealth of sunshine, blended well wit the aroma of flowers. The day was so glorious that the. whole population o M--was tempted out to Church-white and black. Th Methodist Church was full to excess, as there was n( other preaching, in the town, Reformer- Sampson beinl away on business, and Mr. Weston having had a call t, the pastoral care of a Church in the country. Miss Matilda Lankinston, true to her declaration, wa found near the "amen" corner paying the strictest atten tion to the sermon, (or the young preacher, for he was it close proximity to the presiding Elder, who filled the "sacred desk" on this occasion.) 'Every word wa gulped down .with satisfaction. Mr. Taylor, (the Presi ding Elder,) seemed to have participated in the late con ciliatory measures, to which Mr. Weston had causec several of a certain denomination in M- to submit. A first the Baptists were wrong in every iota, and shouli not be tolerated, but now the cry was let us "agree t( disagree." Annie began to think before he was through, that cer tainly the sermon was preached for her benefit. Who knows? Indeed, the preacher dwelt so long on its being the Christian's duty to bear with one another's weakness and faults, and differences of opinions, for unity sake, that she almost began to think that it was wrong to burthen any brother or sister with her complaints. The discourse was entirely too lengthy for report, but allow us to give a short sketch of it here. "Why not agree my friends to disagree? Paul says, he became all things for Christ's sake. His object was to win souls to Christ. When with the Jews,. he became as a Jew, and when with the Gentiles, he became as the Gentiles. Though he disagreed, in some particulars, yet he sacrificed those sentiments in order to win souls to Christ. And this, my friends, is your duty. What if we all have not been baptized alike?-is that essential to. salvation? Should such a minor instance prevent a unity of spirit P   .         TEHE INVESTIGATION.       187 i .  Most assuredly not, my Christian friends. In the lan- guage of the inspired Apostle: 'Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.' Again: 'To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak. I am made a1ll tlings to all men, that I might by all nmans save some.' Though we differ, my Christian friends, circumstantially, let us become our- selves to all mnen-let us agree to disagree, in order that we may gain the more. What are nonessentials? Is the soul's salvation in jeopardy by them? Nay, verily! Then, whether we be Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians or what not, let us all agree to disagree, I   and, 'become to them that are under the law, as under the law, that we may gain them that are under thelaw; To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without the law of God, but under the law of Christ,) that we may gain them that are without law.' j   "Since the kingdom of heaven, my friends, is not ' meat and drink,' but of Spiritual things, what should we care for externals? Since we live in the Spirit why should we not walk in the Spirit, and not ordinances? Is the kingdom of heaven composed of ordinances? Verily Xi  not! Then 'let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the i race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faiti; who for the joy that was set before him endured the Cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.' Bi  "My Baptist friends, we will agree to disagree with you in non-essentials, but in the mean time, let us 'be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another,' endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.' There is but one Spirit, 'even as ye are called into one hope of your calling.' O   "My Reformer friends, the same exhortation I make to you. Remember that the Kingdom of God is not 'meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.' Hence let us not walk in ordinances, to the exclusion of unity of spirit, but let us endeavor to jib  keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace.  :;  "To all other denominations present I would entreat ; the same.

Then why not agree to disagree in nonessentials, in order to the ac- complishment of this great work? The world must be converted before the millennium can come, and the great family of God must be made the instrument in doing it. "Christians, don't you long 'and pray for that hour? It is with you-your unity of Spirit as. to when itsshall come. Therefore, 'be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, livein peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.' I leave the subject for your reflection. It there has been anything said worthy of your acceptance, may God bless it to your-good." As soon as the Elder seated himself, Mr. Sumner suc- ceeded him, and opened the door of the Church. The people were requested to rise to their feet and sing a hymn. A bench was designatted for the applicants. The first stanza was scarcely through, bcforie Miss Matilda Lankinston came up and asked Church-membership! Mr. Sumner was quick to seize her hand and give it a hearty shake for her' zeal in lthe cause. Baptism was demanded. Though it was a violation of the Discipline, it was granted, for effect was the main object. "You see, my friends," spoke Mr. Sumner, "although our mode has been assailed, (he forgot that he or Mr. Bacon was the cause of it,) and presumed to be disputed by the immersionists, there is one yet, who places no essentiality on modes, and is not bought over by every schism that might, 'have been introduced by men. (Oh such words'to come from a Bible reading man!) Our Sister tells us by this act, that she loves the Methodists, and our cause, and that she believes our baptism is valid, for she has chosen to be baptized by sprinkling." * Miss Matilda Lankinston was baptized by aspersion, (may the Lord forgive her ignorance, or willful sin,) and openly made choice of it in preference to the command *Dear reader, believe us, this sketch is true; ii came under our observa- tion not many years since.

After Mr. Sumner had rejoiced sufficiently over the new accession, the Lord's Supper was introduced and Baptists were invited!!! What an insult! The Church of Christ, against which a great blaze of phosphorescent- light, had just been cast was now in the face of such "offences," invited to go and commune with avowed enemies of Truth! That would indeed be a "unity of Spirit!" But we are told to " mark them which cause divisions and oflences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and AVOID them."-For, " if there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed; for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds." With these injunctions held in remembrance, the Baptists could not without violation, commune with those who were committing sacrilege, oir vainly " teaching for doe- trines the commandments of men;" so on this occasion they still adhered to their old principles, and did not ac- cept the invitation, given in the face of such "offences."

ANNIE BACON went home from Church very thoughtful. A suspicion flashed across her mind once, but she ban- ished itattributing it to the whisperings of the evil one. She bent her steps homeward slowly; not taking time to stop to exchange words with Mrs. Crow, but the signifi- cant leer upon that lady's countenance told that she could "tell Annie a thing or two, if she was a mind to." She had placed herself at the little gate of her yard, in ad- vance of Annie to insure a recognition, but it was only given by a bow, very reserved. Mrs. Crow was a little vexed, so she slammed the gate after her as she went in, puffing'and perspiring, quite overcome with the fatigue of walking.  "Well I declare, if Miss Matilda Lankistonl did'nt make me feel the gladdest to-day of my recollec- tion. I saw several Baptists look as if they could crawl in an'auger-hole, had there been one convenient;  Bro. Sumner looked at her with such admiration. Who knows?-but I wont say," and she tumbled into a large rocking chair, out of breath, consoling her disappoint- ment in probabilities. Oh the weakness of human nature! Here is a speci- men! "But they didn't commune with us to-day, even after that great sermon by Bro. Taylor. Well, we might as well give them up to hardness of heart, and reprobacy of mind. It's no use for Bro.

The whole Bible- might be preached to them and they would not be con- vinced; a self-conceited and obstinate sect," she conclu- ded as she began to rock herself again violently, in vent- ing her anger in anathema's on that polyonomous class. Dr. Boon was not out at Church. He had had a call professionally in the country. He had been querulous - and morose ever since the adventure on the river; so he was not anxious to be thrown into society. Necessity compelled him to appear the next morning at Leander Hall, but the subject had assutmed a different aspect from what he had expected, so it was not with any degree of pleasure that he made his appearance there, but more from a sense of obligation. ,Mr. Sumner's ill-luck in sustaining himself the week previously,had been thetown-talk both of the Campbell- ites and Methodist, though both gave him their undivi- ded sympathy. It is a great consolation, it is true, but we prefer an orthodox position to any latitudinarian, with the whole world as abettors. What say you reader? As usual, eight o'clock found our amateurs indulging in the only panacea for the discontented mind on that subject.  Mr. Sumner seemed a little uneasy. Mr. Bacon though he haa read history some, had never confined bjh mind to religious history, so he might have read Moshiem, Neandor, -Tertullian, and many others, but not having an eye to any special thing, lie did not receive any par- ticular impressions. When Mr. Weston proposed look- ing into the origin of sprinkling, he was quite willing. "The point at issue now," began Mr. Weston, (who seeing if he did not no one else would,) "is to settle the beginning of sprinkling.           "  "I think Mr. Weston, you had better settle immersion or its beginning with the I Mad Men of Munster,' first,"  spoke Mr. Sumner ironically, wishing to call attention even by device, from the one under consideration.  "We are not looking into the history of immersion  now, Mr. Sumner, and if we were, we find it practiced  by the Church from the days of John the Baptist.  Since we have found that sprinkling was not prac-  ticed by either the Apostles, ;or previous to the death of  Christ, we are for finding its origin."  g it       :r or  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8270-00000074"/> "2       LEANDER  HALL. -"Well you'l find that the greatest fathers contended 'for it," said Mr. *Bacon triumphantly, thinking that fact suffic:ent to establish its validity. "Allow me to read, Mr. Bacon, what some of your 'greatest fathers' have said on this subject. Hear Dey- lingius a Pedobaptist, and ancient histrian: 'So long as the Apostles lived, as many believe immersion only was used: to which afterwards perhaps, they added a kind of affusion, such as the Greeks practices at this day, after having performed the trine immersion. At length 'fter the Apostles were dead, the baptism of clinics was known; when disease or extreme necessity in any other respect forbade immersion, sprinkling and pouring began to be introduced, which in course of time was retained, plunging being neglected.' So much for him, let us look further. Salmasius, also a Pedo, says: 'The clinics, only because they were confined to their beds, were baptized in a manner of which they were capable: not in the en- tire laver, as those who plunge the head under the water, but the whole body had water poured on it. Thus No- vatus, when sick, received baptism; being besprinkled, not baptized.  "Hear again what a learned Pedobaptist historian says. He was a professor in a Pedobaptist Theological Seminary at Mercersburg, Pennsylvania-Dr. Philip Schaff. In his 'History of the Apostolic Church,' page 568, he says: 'Immersion, and not sprinkling, was un- questionably the original normal form, (of baptism,)' &amp;c. This acknowledgement of course proves that sprink- ling found its birth afterwards. "What does Justin Martyr say? he was one, of the earliest. fathers. In writing to the Emperor an ac- count of his Church in his day, about an hundred and fifty years after Christ, he says: 'I shall now lay before you the manner of dedicating ourselves to God, through Christ, upon our conversion; for, should I omit this, I might not seem to deal sincerely in this account of our religion.- As many as are persuaded and believe that those things which are taught by us are true, and do promise to live according to them, are directed first to pray, and ask God with fasting the forgiveness of their sins; and we also pray and fast together with them. Then we bring them to a plaee where there is water apd   THE INVETrIGATION.        1 4 they are regenerated in the same way that we are regen- erated, for they are washed in the name of the Father, &amp;c., a proof that neither sprinkling nor pouring was the mode of baptism. But let us read further. "Tertullian, who lived somewhat later, writes: ' When we are ready to enter into the water, (and even before,) we make our protestations before the minister, and in the Church that we denounce the devil and all his pomrls and vanities-afterwards we are plunged in the watcr.'" *"Mr. Richard Baxter, with whom you are all acquaint- ed as a writer, says: 'We grant that baptism then (i) primitive times) was by washing the whole body; and did not the difference ot our cold country as torthat hot olle teach us to remember,' I will have mercy and not sacri- fice,' it should be so here.' Paraphrase on the New l7es- tamnent at Matt. iii: 6. "Sir John Floyer, one who studied the compendiunl of cold bathing, and gathered scraps of history from all ancient writers and himself being a Pedobaptirt andl sprinkler, as he lived after the age in which it became customary,-hear him: 'The Church of Rome hatl drawn short compendiums of both sacraments. In the cucharist they use only the wafer, and instead of immer- sion they introduced aspersion. * *  I have now given what testimony I coqld find in our English authors, to. prove the practice of immersion from the time the Britons and Saxons were baptized till King James' days; when the people grew peevish with all ancient ceremo- nies, and through the love of novelty, and the niceness of parents, and the pretence of modesty, they laid aside immersion; WIICIl NEVER WAS ABROGATED BY ANY CANON, but is still recommended by the present rubric of our Church, which orders the child to be dipped discreetly and warily.'-Hist. of Cold Bathinyg, p. 15? 61. "One more witness, and I'll stop. I'll now bring in Dr. Wall, a noted historian, and one on which your Pedobap- tist rely: 'In the case of sickness, weakness, haste, want of quantity of water, or such like extraordinary occas- ions, baptism by allusion of water on the face, was by ancients counted sufficient baptism.

Cornelius does in a letter to Fabius, Bishop of Ahtioch, vindicate his bright, showing that Novation came -not canonically to his orders of priesthood, much less was capable of being chosen Bishop; for that all the clergy and a great many of the laity were against his being ordained presbyter, because it was not lawful (they said,) for a man that had been' baptized in his bed in times of sickness, as he had been, to be admitted to any office of the clergy.' "Much more could be cited from Dr. Wall, but it is not necessary. I presume,. Mr. Sumner, you hold his * as a standard work amongst you, do you not?" "He is, I acknowledge, a very noted historian, and gives a most satisfactory history of infant baptism." "Now," continued Mr. Weston, "I have introduced authors of your own order, proving that immersion was the most ancient mode of baptism, that sprinkling was not known until the third century, the first instance of it being in the case of one Novation who fell sick, and thought would die, it being then performed by pouring' water all around him the best that it could be done in the bed. Furthermore we find that it was repudiated by the priesthood and laity, a proof that it was not -counted as valid. Now I would ask, in consideration of the many proofs which I have introduced, would you, Mr. Sumner, dare say that immersion was originated by the Mad Men of Munster?" Mr. Sumner was silent, for a reply would only make bad, worse. He was very sorry that he had introduced that point." Mr. Bacon was extremely uncomfortable, for he changed chairs several times. Dr. Boon, though he was given to open-communion, could but be pleased to find his choice of modes authen- ticated by history. "But I am not done," continued Mr. Weston, upon inding it was useless to await any comment.

HB INvESTIGATION.       145 "In the Edinburg Encyclopcedia, edited by the learned and celebrated Sir David Brewtser, the history is given. He was an an advocate of sprinkling, and he tells its origin without any equivocation. 'The firsj law for sprink- ling was obtainied in the following manner: Pbpe Steph- en II, being driven from Rome by Astolphus, King of the Lombards, in 753, fled to Pepin, who a short time before had usurped the crown of France. While he remained there, the Monks of Cressy, in Britanny consulted him whether in case of necessity, baptism performed by pour- ing water on the head of infants (here is your authority, Mr. Bacon, for sprinkling the head instead of any other part of the body,) would be lawful? Stephen replied that it 'Would. But though the truth of this fact should be allowed, which, howevcr some Catholics deny, yet pouring or sprinkling was admitted ONLY IN CASES OF NE- CESSITY. It was not until the- year 1311 that the legisla- ture in council held at Ravenia, declared immersion or sprinkling to be indifferent. In this country, (Scotland,) however, sDrinking was never practiced in ordinary cases, till after the Reformation; and in England even in the reign of Edward VI., immersion was commonly observed. But during the persecution of Maryr many'persons, most of whom were Scotchmenl, fled from England to Geneva, t  and there greedily imbibed the opinions of that Church. In 1556 a book was published at that place, containing the forms of prayers and ministration of sacraments, ap- proved by the famous and Godly learned man, John Cal- vin, in which the adlministrator is enjoined to take water in his hand, and-lay it on the child's forehead. These Scottish exiles who. had renounced the authority of the Pope, implicitly acknowledged the authority of Calvin; and returning to their country, -with John Knox at their head, in 1559, established sprinkling in Scotland. From Scotland this practice made its way into England in the reign of Elizabeth, but was not authorized by the estab- lished Church.'" "You do not mean to say, Mr. Weston, that David Brewster was an advocate of sprinkling, do you?" asked Mr. Bacon.    '  "Whether he advocated or believed in it or not, we find that he was a member of the 'Church that practised  13            -   ji  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC8270-00000076"/> "6   -   LEANDfR HALL. it; if giving ones consent by influence is not advocating, I cannot tell what it would be, could you, Dr. Boon??" "I must say this much, Mr. Weston, Sir David Brews- ter could set aside the word of God with more compla- cency than I could. It does seem to me if I were a Methodist, and such facts should be proven in my face, I would make it my duty to join some other Church imme- -diately, and then I'd spend the remnant of my days in exposing the imposition. How do you reconcile your- self to it, Mr. Sumner?" asked the Doctor. Mr. Sumner made no reply. Mr. Bacon hurried to his rescue. "Don't von see into it Doctor? What the learned fathers could do, we can. Are we any better than they? If they have done this and have gone to Heaven, we can do the same. Just so we make 6ur election sure, why Ahould we care?"  Mr. Weston had compassion. He forebore any re- mark on Mr. Bacon's speech. "But I am not quite through, gentlemen. Let me bring in some little corroborating evidence of the cor- rectness of these statements made by Mr. Brewster. You know it will do to take a passage from the Bible to prove anything; but an isolated passage from profane history, without any other testimony, will not stand. I have occasion now, to cite you to Dr. Wall again. His name itself will command any given view to Psedos, and sprinklers, without the evidence of any other testimony. Hear him again: 'France seems to have been the first country in the world where baptism by affusion was used ordinarily to persons in health, and in the public way of administering it. ... It being allowed to weak chil- dren [in the reign of Queen Elizabeth] to be baptized by as- persion, many fond ladies and gentlewomen first, and then by degrees the common people would obtain the favor of the priest to have their children pass for weak chil- dren, too tender to endure dipping in the water.

".Dr. Wall's evidence and Sir David Brewster's go very well together. They show  that sprinkling was of Popish origin, and the Episcopals got it from there, and I say the Methodists got it from the Episcopal Church. Hence, Mr. Bacon, the origin of your loved institution. Perhaps I ought to have introduced Calvin here, but I refer any of you to him who may doubt that his testimo- goes with what I have been trying to prove. Sprinkling is not only Popish but-of heathenish origin. Justin Martyr says that it was 'an invention of de- mons, in imitation of true baptism signified by the Propk- ets, that their votaries might also have their pretended  puriification by water.' See Middletons letters from Rome.* Tertullian in his book on baptism, says: 'The heathens did adopt a religious right, particularly in the mysteries of Apollo and Ceres, where persons were bap- ltized for their regeneration and pardon (take no offence Dr. Boon,) of their perjuries.' 'Here we see,' he contin. ues further, 'the aim of the devil, imitating the things of (God- -Wall's Hist." "And can it be possible that in this century, that thou- sands will suffer themselves to be bound to Popish prin- ciples, by a mark of a few drops of water on the fore- head? Certainly Mr. Weston, it is not known-the origin of sprinkling, I mean," exclaimed Dr. Boon. "Inown?-ask Mr. Sumner here."  "Though Mr. Sumner should give me his word for it, I don't know as I could be credulous enough to believe," remarked Dr. Boon, smilingly. Be it remembered that it was not practiced in the Church in his age.  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC8270-00000077"/> "$8      BEANDBR HALL "But I would like to hear you on it, Mr. Sumner. Do you believe it is generally known?-or did you know it yourself?" asked Mr. Weston. "I've always known that sprinkling found its origin in- the third century, but there are so many evidences in the New Testament of its being in vogue in the apostolic days, I must think it went out of practice for about two centuries, and then introduced perhaps by some one that had a knowledge of it, or it might 'have always been in practice and no mention made of it, the necessity for such a thing being seldom." "And yet you must acknowledge, Mr. Sumlner, that on last week we examined every passage in the Scriptures that could lead any one to believe that it was practiced, and in no case did we find immersion impossible. Do you regard immersion valid, Mr. Sumner?" "I do sir, but that does not necessitate us to invalidate sprinkling or pouring."  "It certainly does. Paul says; 'ONE LORD, ONE FAITH, ONE BAPTISM!!' the consequent being, if you have two baptisms, you must have two LonDs and two FAITHS!! You do away with omnipotence. Now, we come to close communion. Would you, Mr. Sumner, commune with a Roman Catholic?"  "Of course not." "Youi' answer for it sir, and yet the separating ordi- nance, which you practice has been proven to be of Popish and of heathenish origin. You still hold their abomina- ble innovations, to the exclusion of Christs command, and yet you refuse to commune with them! But we, the Baptists, who profess to follow Christ, regardless of every man-made creed, because. we refuse to commune with the unbaptized, and with. those who acknowledge Popery the origin of the ordinance which separates the Church from the world, (in that you recognize the Pope's athority) we are censured, scorned, abused, nicknalmed, and held up to the world as a target of shame, for the combined missiles of Popedom and its many descend- ants! or schisms springing from its authority!! You re- fuse to-commune with the Roman Catholics. I am doing no more in refusing to commune with those who ac- knowledge an institution of theirs as coming from the Pope. If you refuse to commune with a Church from   THE INVESTIGATION.        149 which sprang your cherished ordinance, your retaining it, being an acknowledgement of authority from whence it sprang-then if you refuse to commune with it, am I not' justifiable at least, in refusing to commune with those who acknowledge such authority, when I profess and de- clare by actions and sentiment, that I hate the Pope, his papal power, and the path of blood in which history traces his career,? I leave the fairness of the case with Dr. Boon here, though he is an avowed open-commun- onist. What'say you Doctor?" "I must acknowledge, Mr. Weston, that there is a plausibilitv iin your doctrine, and I confess that I never looked on it, in that light before. It is even more fair in your refusing to commune with a sect that recog- nizes the Pope's authority, than for that sect to refuse to commune with the Church whose authority it recognizes, in changing ordinances, &amp;c." " ellsaid Doctor. I think this single reason itself is suf- ficient excuse for my close communion. But there is another attached just here. I have proven that sprinkling (your ordinance, Mr. Samner,) is not valid. In the beginning of this subject, we started to examine the Methodist Church, to see if it was the true Church of Christ. Since its ordinance of separation from the world the first visi- ble feature of the' Church, is unlawful, therefore the Metlodist Church cannot be the true Church of Christ. We 1have found but one Church in the New Testament, we have found the ordinance oi comullnion belonging to that Church exclusively, practised in, and by, that Church only, and represented by Paul as being a Church ordi- nance, not an individual. fiauily, or worldly privilege, but belonging to the Church. "As the Methodist society is not thItt Church, would you have me to commune with it?-tiereD recognizing it as the true Church when it is not? By- my afftiliating with a class that acknowledges the Pope's authority to change ordinances, this class, virtually doing this by still retain- ing those ordinances to the exclusion of Christ's com- mands-thus would I be also assenting to such authority which I know at heart I do not, so I will not make it ap. pear in this light outwardly. The- Methodist Church is not the true Cliurch of Christ, for it is lacking in the first principle, thenretre I cannot commune with it. Yet We  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8270-00000078"/> 150       LEANDE-R HALL. will not stop here in the examination. let us see before we leave it, the extent of its defects. Tliough we know that-it has not. been baptized into the 'one body,' let us look at it in every light, and per/haps there may be some redeeming poininit it yet." Annie Bacon all the while had been giving her undivi- ded attention to the proceedings. The developments were strange to her. She felt a little ashamed of herself when she remembered how she insisted on Mollie Weston's presence in order that she might be convinced of the Baptists' great error, in relation to modes. , "One more thought on this point," continued Mr. Weston, "and I am  done. As a doctrine, you teach sprinkling in preference to immersion. Now you must concede that it is a man-made-creed and born within the gates of mystic Babylon, and propagated under the fostering care of the Pope. In short, it is one of the 'abominations' of the 'mother of harlots,' and a false doctrine, and an 'offence' to the Church. Now since we are commanded to mark them ihich cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which we have learned, and AVOID them, hence we can hold no fellowship with you, for you know that you do teach false doctrines."  Baptists, reflect on what Mr. Weston has said, and the quotation from the Bible, whenever you have a disposi- tion to bid God speed to those who are disseminating false doctrine, and that knowingly! You must AVOID such! Dr. Boon was astonished at the ,argument adduced in favor of close communion, but he was' not quite willing to yield, yet. Suffer me to ask a question here, Mr. Weston," he said after a moment's pause. "Certainly, certainly, Doctor." "With that passage of scripture before you, how can you even go to Methodists meetings., r to the other de- nominationsathat you believe, teach false doctrine?" "It is wrong, I know Doctor, to encourage any class that teaches false doctrine, but Baptists will do it some times. This ought not to be, for we are positively-- co - manded to the contrary, but many who seek popularity at the sacrifice of principle, will thus compromise the teachings of the Bible. Now I believe it ie wrong to en.   THE INVESTIGATION.       oi. gage with other denominations in protracted meetings, though some may urge that they are striving to convert sinners, if so let them come where' they ought to be, and then we can co-operate, and without doing viblenco to the commandments. We are willing to hold fellowship with all denominations, but let them get where they ought to be first. And before we can join in their efforts, we would enjoin on them-'Brother, cast the beam from thine own eye; or right thyself first, and then we will help you to labor in the conversion of sinners, Otherwise, we are told to AVOID you.'" Mr. Sumner glanced at his watch, whereupon Dr. Boon I made the following move: "As our time is out, gentlemen, I propose that we sus- pend for the present." "And take up the subject of Infant Baptism next, if it accords with system," interrupted Annie. "Very well," said Mr. Weston. "It suits me, also." said Mr. Sumner. I  "Well," spoke in Mr. Bacon, who had been silent for some time, "do as you please about this thing, only, I beg you to hurry and get through with it: I think we can prove easily and quickly that infant baptism was practiced in the Apostolic age, if sprinkling were not. I hope there won't be a long fuss about it." i "We must indeed be as brief about it, as we possibly can, for we have been on one question for nearly two weeks, though you know we have not been engaged more than two or three hours at the time, and tnen the trouble of hunting up evidences, has detained us," said Mr. Wes- ton, concurring with Mr. Bacon, as to the question of time if in nothing else. "Well, suppose we suspend for the present, and I will arrange to-night, a concise compendium of argument, composed of the greatest importance, so to-morrow, there will not be as much time consumed in examining points in order to discriminate between the major and minor." Very well, Mr. Sumner. It is getting late now, and no doubt all would like a little recreation. Do you think you will be with us Doctor?" Y"It depends on circumstances, though I want to stick to you all as much as possible, so when you come to try  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8270-00000079"/> 162       LEANDER  HALL, my Church, I'll know how to meet you," he responded, smiling, though we cannot think without some silent misgivings, concerning the event of such a thing. The company broke up.        t  Annie sought her room immnediately after this disper- sion to think. What strange and startling facts had pre- sented themselves within the last few days. She looked on Miss Matilda Lankinston's conduct with disgust. She began to divine the motive and in spite of her own an- noyances, she could but smile. But she hushed her sus- picions, as soon as they rose, for she did not like to yield to such reflections, neither in an ill-omen sense, nor of con- tempt. Once, she almost caught a glimpse of future reality, and oh what a rush of deep, dark, sad, and gloomy feelings, found their way to her heart! She sought to rest before dinner, but her spirit was in the seething wa- ters of trouble, so her body was kept iin subjection. She essayed a fervent prayer, but the mind would revert to the troup of strange incidents thgt had imposed them- selves on her within the last two weeks.-- It seemed that the coming of the Weston family was fraught with a contrariety of vicitudes undreampt of before, and pre- cocious in the extreme. 'She began to recapitulate, but her astonishment at the weighty reality which spread its surprising panorama before her, was so great, that she abandoned the attempt, and suffered her mind to wander from subject to subject,. comprising a train of excruciating reflections. At length the dinner-bell rang, which was music far sweeter than the mournful -cadence of -melancholy thoughts. It was indeed a welcome herald to call her away from such emotions of sadness She brushed her hair quickly, and adjusted the fluted ruffle that fell so gracefully and temptingly on her bosom, and hurried down to the dining-room. But no'betterpicture awaited her there, for a gloom had settled on Leander Iall. Mr. Bacon never noticed his daughter now, who, a short time ago, was his pride-his hope-his idol. And what had wrought this change? simply her disagreement with him as to rights of the communicant. Mr. Bacon, instead o - dealing with forbearance and expostulations, dealt in bitter reproof and unfeeling treatment. Annie might have re tracted,and obtained forgiveness, but when the father is   THEI INVESTIGATION.        158 unyielding,the child is apt to inherit alike disposition. So the story runs in the same old channel. Dr. Boon, on his way home, met with. tl o veritable Mr. Sampson, who had just returned from a long jour- ney. As usual a conference was held, in which Mr. Sampson was the colloquist, presuming much speculation. "'Well, Doctor, I've been anxious to hear all about it, but hav'nt met any one yet, so you happen to be the right man in the right place. What's up now? Weston-I hople has given it up--eh? Well, I thought he would; how could- any body stick to such a principle? I am glad, glad to hear that you all have come out so well; I hope now Weston will join us, I don't see anything else he can do if he stays here. Does he look much down-cast? It( a great- pity for him that lie undertook it, though good may yet come of it." Dr. Boon suffered the preacher to rattle away to his satisfaction, then answered him, by putting an end to his many conjectures. "You are too fast- my dear sir, if you'll reverse your surmisesyou will come nearer the facts in the case, than you have." "What?-you don't mean to insinnate.-Oh its a trick Doctor, you are for playing off on me! I see through it." "Not at all, Mr. Sanmpson. I would it were, though understand, I have not been touched yet; in fact I hav'nt been in but a little while, I've had other business, though I've seen enough to know that Weston has led Mr. Sum- ner, orthodoxly and historically, according to his inclina- tion, and much against Mr. Sumner's views." "You don't tell me so! Well, I know Sumner has no' the weight of argument on his side in some points, but ] thought any one could manage Weston. I venture to say, he quibbles around you all no little, don't hie?"' "I cannot, with justice to him, say that he does, but I remark here, that some one else will have to combat with him beside me, for to: tell the truth, I don't feel compe- tent." ' "Tut, tut, tut. What, one of my hearers to say that? You know there is nothing for him to contend with you about, but this old, ignorant, -and superstitious notion about the miraculous operations of the Spirit, and seeing ghosts and hobgoblins. You know any man with two   &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8270-00000080"/> 154      LEANDER HALL. grains of sense could refute a compilation of such notions as long as the moral law, without half trying. Why, haven't I preached to you, time and again, on this subject, and shown the folly of such a thing, in a thousand in- Btances?" He had often attempted to derogate the office of the Holy Ghost, yet the Spirit still "-bears witness" in earth. "1 know, Bro. Sampson, you have kept your cngre- g:tion pretty well posted, but I cannot think myseli com- petent to the task, of contending with Mr. Weston.' Dr. Boon was secretly doubting the reality of his reli- gion, therefore he did not feel like contending for what he did not fully embrace.  "You know, Doctor, as much about the subject as I do." Perhaps he did, when Mr. Sampson had made it his point to select a certain collection of passages to preach from, and preached from no 'others. Who could not understand him-? A lawyer may state a thing, and tre- peat it over again till the jury will believe him, and yet it may be unauthenticated, or upheld by mere circumstan- tial evidence. Dr. Boon stood a moment in reflection. He bethought himself. "Cannot you arrange it, Bro. Sampson, so as to be present." "Impossible, sir! impossible! Business calls me from M--- this week, (very opportune, we conclude,) and perhaps I may be gone for several months." Mr. Sampson was no votary to the cause. He was very brave when no danger was about, but when he saw the lion coming, his cry was ," Let me alone, and 'll let you alone!" though he would swallow his adversary, if he could be assured of no struggle. Some how, settling nu an estate, and cashing bonds,weremore consistent with ?Mr. Sampson's temper of mind than striving in theology. Perhaps it was owing to this state of the case, as con- ceived of, in the existing light. Dr. Boon lid not like the way "Bro. Sampson" was clearing himself of trouble, though his ingenuity in get- ting out of it was rather laughable. He reminded him of the man "who was everywhere, but-here!"  Ho stood a moment eyeing the preacher, and then he bade   THE INVESTIGATION.        155 him good day, hoping mentally that he might not find any business to attend to, so that he would be com pelled to return to M-- .

Though he had promiscc( Elder Taylor to keep him post-  ed daily, yet he could not bear to chronicle the ill-luck to himself and cause, so he declined for the present, hoping the morrow would be better. Immediately after dinner, he sought his study, to ar- range a get-at-ible (a home-made word), form of docu- ment for the coming day. He began his cogitations with some little hope, for he felt that he was posted now, better than before. Let us leave him in his " inner sanctuary" of thought, and hasten to attend to bther calls, for he must seek a palladium for himself, from the scraps of Perin, Neander, Wall, Brewster, Braxster, together with many other Pedobaptist writers.

But early Wednesday morning, he might have been seen wending his way to Leander Hall, with a pack of heavy volumes under his arm. Though the morn was- delightful, and though the salubrious atmosphere seemed bracing against any contingency of decay, his thoughts were too much engrossed with the plan of his discussion, to enjoy one moment of felicity, from the present con- tributors. All Nature appeared to be breathing a fragrance unu- sual, only in the brightest scintillations of its culminated glory, but nothing seemed so attractive as the all-absorb- ing subject, of which he was in contemplation. The sombre forest of the opposite bank of the Ohio, formed a concatenated wall, impregnable to the sweeping rays of the sun, )lut it glided before his view without disturbing his optical nerves, which-were evidently in subordination to his mental vision. Under the shades of this solemn and grand fortification, the incessant. river rolled on, in its meandering course, as an additional strength to its co- temporaries of Beauty and Sublimity; but Mr. Sumner, in his deep sanctuary of revery, was oblivious of such surroundings. The plebian, the prince, the king, the subject, are all alike blessed with Nature's wealth of glo- ry; but the soul, so often contracted by self-interest, turns awry, and the scene moves on with time, and passes the thoughts of men. Mr. Bacon stood ready to meet his expected guest, and led him into his study, as was his custom. There was no breach in the party on this morning. All seemed buoyant and hopeful but Mr. Bacon, who, it ap- peared, had settled down into an austere, morose, and querulous mood, irrevocably. No effort at pleasantry could draw forth a smile, but every remark caused a frown. Mr. Sumner introduced the subject. "There has been much written and said on this very  important subject.. I hope, however, we may succeed, Mr. Weston, in coming to a clear understanding of all imaortant points connected therewith, and in a manner as concise as possible," he said with some confidence. I join with you, Mr. Sumner, in that hope. What division do ybu propose investigating first?" "I must first prove the identity of what is denominated   THE INVSXTIGATIroi.       157 the Jewish and Christian Churches. In the former, you know, children were members. In proving the identity, it follows, of course, that children must be memners of the latter, as there was no law for excluding them. I will begin with the great covenant made with A braham. Here is the covenant upon which the Church was organ- ized: 'And. when he was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God: walk before me and be thou perfect. And 1 will make my covenant (one covenant only) be- tween me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him saying, As for me, behold my covenant is with thee, and  thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram; but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you, and thy seed after thee. Every man child among you shall be circumcised.'--Gen. xvii: 1-10.          -           ! "This covenant contains three distinct promises. 1:  promise of numerous natural descent, which we know has been fulfilled. 2: That his natural seed should inherit the land of Canaan, which also has been fulfilled. 8: That he should be the father of many nations; that in his seed all the families of earth should be blessed. The latter is the great promise of this covenant-the promise of spir- itual blessings, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Now this covenant is sealed and ratified by the sign of ercumeision. In this covenant children are included; hence the orgamn-  zation of the Church of God. When was 'it disorgain- ized? At what period, Mr. Weston, were children exclu- ded from the promises of God? I want you to answer  this proposition."                  '  A real smile presumed to illuminate Mr. Bacon's coun.   &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8270-00000082"/> 168       L EANDER HALL. tenance, the first time for several days. He was all hope. "You won't try to do it, will you, Mr. Weston? 've never seen a place in the whole Bible, where it says chil- dren must not come into the Church. It is not there, either!"And to make his assertion more impressive, he ,stamped the floor with his foot violently, almost mena- cingly. "You have found what you denominate the Church, Mr. Sumner?" proceeded Mr. Weston, not noticing Mr. Bacon's demonstrations of gymnastieal exercise. "Yes, sir. and you will grant that it is the Church of God, if I can prove, that piety was a prerequisite to cir- cumcision? "Certainly, certainly. You know that baptism does require piety, and is the separating ordinance of the Church, of this dispensation, if circumcisionwerethe se- parating ordinance of. the Church of the old dispensation, then it follows, as a matter of course, that it must have required piety. If not, then the body that subscribed to that ordinance was not the Church." "Just so, Mr. Weston. But we know that circumci- sion did require piety. Now, allow me to read some proof of it. 'Thou shalt keep my- covenant, therefore thou and thy seed after thee, in their generations.' So it appears that, not only Abraham, but his posterity, were embraced in the, covenant, and were all required, as truly as was Abrahanmi to keep the covenant with God. Could they do this without piety? This is not all. The Apos- tle Paul in his epistle to the Romans has forever settled this question. He not only declares, as I have proved, that without true piety circumcision is worthless, but he farther says, ' For he is not a Jek, which is one outward- ly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly: and cir- cumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and .not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.' If Judaism were nothing but a national affair, and circumci- sion only a national mark, how could Paul say, he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly? Could a Jew possess that circumcision of the spirit, really, whose praise is not of men, but of God, and yet have no piety? Until this is set aside, and not till then will I give this up." Mr. Sumner had grown confident.   TnHE INViSSTIGATION.      159 "Answer that argument, sir, answer it!" exclaimed Mr. Bacon springing from his chair, and confronting Mr. Weston, assuming an air of incredulity, as much as to say: "You dare not try." "Allow me time, if you please," suggested Mr. Weston reprovingly. Mr. Bacon took the hint, and resumed his seat. "It is but right that I should notice your first point Mr. Sumner, which was, because God promised to be a God unto Abraham and his seed, circumcision must be a mark of piety. Who denies but God promised a special pro- tection to the seed of Abraham according to the flesh? Does it follow that circumcision was a sign of piety? Is there any such a requisition made in the covenant? Does he tell them they must do this or that because they were circumcised? No! His only request in that covenant, was, that they should keep the covenant, be circumcised,? or that soul should be cut off from his people. So much' for that. But the next point, 'circumcision of the heart.' Allow me here to ask a few questions. When Paul said, ' For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly,' you cannot think that he meant it literally, can you?".   "Oh no, of course not." "And when he said, 'Neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,' you cannot think he meant literally, that cutting off the foreskin was not circumci- sion-a Jewish mark, can you? "No sir, I do not," he replied uneasily, with a slight hitch of his chair. "And when he said, 'But he is a Jew which is one. inwardly,' you cannot think that he meant, literally, that the seed of Abraham according to the flesh were not Jews; or that the tribe that carried that fleshy mark, were not Jews, can you? In short do you take thisa-in a literal sense?" '"No, I Ido not," he again responded, but more cau- tiously. "Then the whole thing is a figure and you cannot make anything else of it; or rather, an antitype of the fleshy circumcision, not taken, in a material sense at, all. It is a strong proof that circumcision of the flesh was not a mark of spiritual blessings-it had nothing to do with the heart; but that, 'Christians are the true circumci-  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8270-00000083"/> sion,' as Paul expressly says: that is, circumcision of the flesh was thte type, and circumcision of the heart, the anti- type. If circumcision of the flesh werea mark of spirit- ual blessingswhy the necessity of Paul's resorting to the circumcision of the heart, when the mark was already manifest? But on the contrary, he wishes to impress us ,that the fleshy mark was no signl, of spiritual blessings- in a spiritual sense, it was uncircumcision, but as to flesh, it was yet good. To explain this more clearly, Paul in referring to the circumcision of the flesh, had in view its virtueless effect as regards the Christianl Jew. ie did not aim to invalidate it as far as the national sign went, but the truly circumcised-those who had been born again, should as the antitype of the flesh marked Jew, in- herit the heavenly Canaan, which was the antitype of the earthly Canaan. To take that passage in a literal sense, we must conclude, that none were Jews but those who were Christians, and that' the outward mark did no more distinguish the Jew, than anything else. But we know this is not so, therefore, some other construction must be placed on that passage. Your verdict gentlemen? Shall we continue on this, or shall we pass on? As for my part, I am willing to go to the extent of its controversy. If cir- cumcision required piety, I cannot see wherein the requi- sition is made. Circumcision of the heart, and circumci- sion of the flesh are two things. The former is immate- rial,while-the latter, material-the former of the Spirit, the Christian prerogative or the inwardJew, the antitype of the fleshy Jew, according to the sign in theflesh; and the latter of the letter, and of the flesh only. But we will give further proof of this in time to come. What do you say, Mr. Sumner, shall we continue on this point or proceed to others belonging to this discussion?" "I don't presume it is worth while to argue on this any longer. There are other more incontrovertible proofs of my proposition. I will bring them forward." "Well do," consented Mr. Weston. "Paul, writing to the Galatians, says; 'I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law,' chap. v. 3. Could any one keep the whole law, which was given to the Jewish Church, with- out possessing piety? That law required them to love God, with the whole heart. Could they do this without t    piety? Why, Paul teaches us, that circumcision, without true piety, was absolutely worthless. 'For circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumci- sion.' Rom. ii. 25. Now, can any man keep the law, the moral law, of which, as the connection shows, he is speaking, without piety? You must perceive Mr. Wes- ton the inmpoisibility without further examination. Cir- cumcision did require piety, and no one can doubt it un- less he will, against reason." ".Not so fast. Mr. Sumner. I will ask you to favor me in one thing before your proposition passage is set aside." "What is it?" asked Mr. Sumner, not comprehending the significant tone of Mr. Weston's voice. "That you read the preceding verses of that chapter. Here is the book-and there is the place marked, the number of verses I want read. Now I ask you all to pay particular attention," "'Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith. Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.' Mr. Sumner stopped a moment for reflection. The passage was strange in its significance. "Read on Mr. Sumner-the two verses following." "'For I testify again to every man thatis circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.' " Mr. Sumner began to wish he had not headed his pro-  position with the verse from that chapter. But'an en- couraging idea struck him, with such force, as to make  hinl almost leave his chair. "You cannot think Mr. Weston that the Apostle meant that circumcision was a sin, to be punished with death, do you t'" he asked with some hope of confounding the meaning. No, I do not."  "r or can you think that circumcision prohibited the effect of Grace do you?" "No, not at all. Many that were circumcised were  born unto Christ afterwards."  "Then what can you mean? What, construction do you place on that passage?" 14 !3  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC8270-00000084"/> 162    .  LEANDER  HALL.  "'One moment, and I will tell you: even by your own acknowledgements. First let me ask you a feW ques- tions. I like this question system, for it is the most conclusive wav of settling a point at issue. I would ask you: In fulfillment of the promise, that the seed of the womnn shouldbruise the Serpent's head, what has redeemed man  "Of course the Grace of God, and the ofering of the blood of the 'Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.'" "Just so. The idea that Paul wished to convey was, that justification was of faith aiid not of the law. A proof that the whole law could be obeyed and yet avail nothing, as concerning redemption,-for whosoever was circum- cised was a' debtor to do the whole law,' yet that could not save him. One great failing of the Jews, was to rest in the law, hence Paul does away with the idea that it was of salvation. As circumcision was a prerogative of the law, and one that required total obedience to the whole law, then whosoever was circumcised and 'steed on it as a spiritual seal, to hinm 'is Christ become of nlo effect.' But this does not exclude the Jew. -Ie can beP circumcised and yet be justified, though by faith. In this we find a strong reproof to those who might mistake cir- cumcision for a seal of spiritual blessings, and rest in it, instead of the blood of Christ. But, as you have said that no one can keep the whole laRw without piety, I would now ask you, what such piety is worth if there is no salvation in it? It cannot make circumcision a seal, or sign of spiritual blessings, what is its value? You have agreed witht Paul that we are saved by Grace. He has told you. that the whole law niight be obeyed, and yet you not justified by it. Then what is asuch piety worth? Can it be a spiritual blessing? I leave it with you Mr. Sumner. If circumcision had been a sign of spiritual blessings, then he that rested in the law attached, and had been circumcised would have'been justified." Mr. Bacon was shocked, and provoked beyond endu- rance. Once he cast an imploring look at Mr. Sumner, but seeing no hope there, he gave a petulent grunt and turned his head in dispair. What was Mr. Sumner to do now? he had failed sig. nally to establish his point on which he relied in proving the identity of Church. The Pentateuch, his hope foi   infant baptism was trembling 'and crumbling rapidly under his feet, and soon, if matters progressed thus, he  would be standing on the bare foundation of the New Testament-the very place he ought to have been from the first. "Have you any more testimony, Mr. Sumner, to bring forward?" ;' asked Mr. Weston, after a moment's silence. "Yes Bro. Sumner bring it forward now.  You must spur up, or you will lose your grounds. Bring up such proof as Mr. Weston dare not touch. I kn6w there must be sorme in the Bible. We all know that the Jews were God's people, therefore they must have been pious. God promised to be a God unto them, and he did take them under his special care. Think; can't you call to mind some place where he requires piety? Did'nt he tell them to ' walk holy,' before him?" ,Even if he did," said Mr. Weston, "it had no con- nection with circumcision, Mr. Bacon, so such argument is a mere figment, and entirely useless." "But I know-it is not'! Whoever heard of anythinga so absurd, as God's people not being pious? I know there is proof in ths Bible, in mine at least. Annie go bring me Clark's Commentaries out of my study. Ill prove it to the gentleman." "Oh no, Bro. Bacon, let it pass; I will be able to prove my point without this help. I am going to show that God promised spiritual blessings in his covenant with Abraham, and I guess the gentleman will give it up then," said Mr. Sumner, ,for he had a strong presentiment that his friend would be mistaken, and made to appear more ridiculous if Be attempted such a thing as examining the Bible in connexion with commentaries. This somewhat pacified Mr. Bacon, so60 he resumed his seat and said no more. "Before you go on to the next point Mr. Sumner, al. lows me to bring up more proof of my position. By way of enquiry, what piety was there in the servants and wgarriors of Abaham's family, that entitler them to cir- cumcision?"  "We do not know that they were not pious." "Yet'we have not the slightest intimation of such a thiug. But leaving them, what piety was there in the Shechemites, as detailed in Gen. xxxiv.? Certainly you jhchmts as vc     r m   &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8270-00000085"/> 164       LANDERS HALL. must admit that no faith or piety was propounded or pro- fessed in that case." Mr. Sumner could say nothing to this. Dr. Boon came to his relief. Not in the way of argu- ment, but an interruption. ' It appears to me Mr. Sumner, this ground you have taken is very untenable. You reriember when God commanded the passover, he commanded cilrcmcision before its observance, now if faith or piety jhad beel. called for in this institution why was there not some mern- tion made of such requirements? When he commandedl Abraham to circumcise his slaves, why did he not say something about their. coidition moiall y? It strikes me, very forcibly that such a thing never was thought of, or- some mention of it would I :ve been made, especially a matter of so much importance; or Moses was exceedingly lax in his style of communicating such momentous items." Mr. Bacon muttered some unintelligible, phraseology, ending with, " he thought one was enough on Bro. Sum- ner at a time." Dr. Boon seeing that it was a source of annoyance, kept silent, promising himself to be a mere listenerni the flture unless called on, especially. Mr. Sumner-was evidently at a loss to -know what to say. He began to turn over the leaves of a book absent- ly, but the noise of the rattling paper, recalled his mind, even to a renewed consciousne;.s of his painful situation. Mr. Weston broke the silence. "I have given you a good opportunity Mr. Sumner, of proving Church identity by not mentioning but one -cove- nant, but you have failed; am I to blame? If circunlci- sionwerenot a mark of piety, then it could not be the separating ordinance of the Church from the world, as you said; so the old Jewish organization which held that mark, was not the Church of God, en masse.' Yet, I will bear with you farther. I will grant you immunities, before unheard of, -You may still keep the single covenant, and if you nan find any spiritual blessings in it for Abra. ham's seed, promised directly to them, I will yet give you the advantage of Church identity, in order to prove in- fant baptism. I know, this is an unlimited .charter, but the cause is dcsparate, and something unqst be done, :or. you are lost."   THE INVESTIGATION,        16S "If you acquiesce in that Mr. Weston, -can surely prove that spiritual blessings were promised in the cove- nant of circumcision, expressly, and directly to Abra- ham's seed according to the flesh." "I promise, and I will stand to the bargain. Dr. Boon here must be a witness. But there ought to be other provisions. On the other hand, if you fail in your pur- pose, you ought to give up your grounds in the Penta- teuch. -Will you do this.?" "Of course I will," he answered readily. Mr. Bacon again became hopeful. "Gentlemen," said Dr. Boon, rising to his feet, " it is now eleven. We have spent nearly three hours this morning, but you know debating is a slow business, as there are so many passages to be hunted out. If you intend introducing another point in the subject, suppose you put it off until to-morrow, as an interruption to- day would lessen the interest?" "I think it a very good plan," said Mr. Weston. "And so do I," said Mr. Sumner. The proposition was readily agreed to, in order that time "ght not break into a subject, as they had in the begin- ning of the investigation allotted only four hours of each day to its prosecution. Dr. Boon took his leave immediately, as some patients in the country were anxionsly expecting him. Mr. Weston and Mr. Sumner staid until after noon (something singular,) and chatted on miscellaneous topics. Then-Mr. Sumner left. Annie sat in herroom wrapt in melancholy thought, in- cident to the influence of the investigation, when a servant entered unnoticed. She began to arrange some scattered books on a table before Annie observed her presence. "Has Mr. Sumner gone Maria?" she asked, when she discoverved her presence. "No, Miss Annie, he is in de parlor lookin' bery lone- some, and I believe he is waitin' for you," and the girl began to' dust violently the pile of books which she had placed, as she imagined, in a very imposing style. "Waiting for me?" repeated Annie in some little sur- prise. "Yes Miss, he aint readin', nor nothin, he is jes settin dar lookin' straight at de door and thinkin'  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC8270-00000086"/> "How do you know then, that he wants to see me?" "Oh, Miss Annie, you know he allers wants to see you ebry day." "Where is father?" "He's in his study lookin' at some books. He aint ben in dar, not at all sense Mr. Westin leff." Annie sat a moment reflecting, She did not know whether it would be expedient to go down or not. She was equally afraid of intrusion and inhospitality. What was Mr. Sumner doing in the parlor alone? If he want- ed to see her, why did he not send her word? She re- volved these thoughts in her mind rapidly, and once concluded not to go down, but something whispered: "You had better go. He is your guest." She waited not for the second suggestion from this warning monitor, but immediately went to the parlor. Mr. Sumner left his seat upon her entrance, and advanced towards her. "Excuse me Mr. Sumner. I did not know that you were in here until a moment ago. I thought you had gone nome. Why did you not send for me? or did you wish to enjoy a little solitude?" "Tot at all Annie, I thought you would be in directly, and I suddenly became enveloped in a 'brown study,'" he added smilingly. "And I've interrupted you," she said, self-reprovingly. "Oh no. I am glad you have come; I want to have a talk with you.", "Me?-about what?" she asked in a puzzled tone.  Annie had her presentiment. It was a foreboding of dark import. Nor were her-suspicions unfounded. Mr. Sumner saw the shadow as it swept across her face. He could not misapprehend. "N'othing Annie to make you look so seriously. Don't be frightened,/ he hastily interposed. "But what is it? Your looks imply more than youi words. Tell me I beseech you. Is it anything I have said or done?" I don't know that it can be termed either exactly, but you have not missed it far. It has become a common talk Annie, and I am going to ask a favor of you; one which necessity requires." "Why keep me in this painful suspense, Mr, Sumner.?   Have you no regard for my feelings? 'Why torture me th is? Let it be what it may, I must hear, and that fo:thwith," she added, imperatively. "Listen Annie. You know it is generally understood throughout my circuit, that we are betrothed." "Yes; I am sorry it is so public. But what has that to do with this revelation, which you are about to make?" "It is this Anniej The membership are very Strict as regards my principles. Our discipline is no less stringent. As I. am received into the bosom of the Church, so must be my wife. You know it would not be deemed right for me to marry a dissenter from our Church-" "Mr. Sumner what do you mean? It cannot be possible -no I will not think it! I hardly understand you!" ejaculated the excited girl, partially comprehending his meaning. "Go on," she added after a moment's pause. It has become a common talk Annie; that you,"-and he hesitated, for it was very repugnant to utter such painful Words as were on his lips. "Me-what?" she demanded, looking him in the face, as the light began to stream athwart her agitated brain, ip double violence. "I have been told that you have said, you would not commune with our Church; and yet a member of it too. Is this true Annie? Why have you been so careless in your expression?" he asked mournfully, and in a touching tone, hoping to draw forth an acknowledgement of her error, and a promise to cease in the future. Annie confronted him undauntedly, and replied: ', Mr. Sumner, if I ever uttered such sentiments, I have no recollection of it; but allow me to tell you plainlly now, and once for all, that I cannot commune with your Church, (I do not consider it mine now,) unless you can, in the' future, prove from the Bible, that it has a surer foundation than' mere tradition of men. -I have been kept in astonishment for-the last few weeks, at the strange developments that have been made in such rapid succession, and all antagonistic to the Church and its creeds, which-I have been taught to reverence and eca brace, as though they were of Divine origin. Mr. Sunm. ner hear me. I would not again suffer the sprinkling ol a-few drops of water on my head, in the name of the Holy Trinity, for ten thousand worlds like this globe upon  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC8270-00000087"/> which I stand! It is sacrilege! antichristian!! and a pa- pal decree!! From whence is its origin? Ask your own fathers. They all testify of its Popish birth. What? institute an ordinance in Christ's Church? The magni- tude of such a crime, I aver is not half comprehended! We differ on this-point widely Mr. Sumner. Please do not ask me to give up my sentiments, I never can, un- less otherwise convinced from the Bible!" "Is this decisive Annie? May I not hope that you will change? Consider the consequences of such heresy," he pleaded.  "HERESY? You certainly do not mean what you say. If this is heresy, then the BIBLE Is HERESY!" 'But Annie, you, can entertain* your opinions on this, and yet do no harm. Only don't express them. Give me the privilege of contradicting the reports and all will be righted," he pleaded persuasively. "Mr. Sumner would you do it since I made the decla- ration which I have? Could you wish me to be silent against my conscience? Compunction would corrode on my restless spirit until peace wonld be a stranger. Be- lieve me, I am not accustomed to such work. My honest convictions are always made public, if necessity requires it, and I must conclude that it does in this case." "But Annie, you do not look at this thingin its proper light. You are so very peculiar (he meant obstinate,) in your notions. Such a thing as you have contemplated would inevitably bring down a load of grief on both of ds, which would be hard to bear. However, make me ONE promise Annie, and we will drop this unpleasant subject." "What is it?" she faintly asked. "That you forbear expressions in the future." "I cannot say," she quickly replied. "But you must Annie. At least until you are better convinced, and more thoroughly acquainted with this affair." "I cunnot give you an unequivocal promise to that, Mr. Sumner," she answered after a moment. "You must Annie, you must! Think, I am beseiged on all sides by the sad tidings of your disaffection. You cannot imagine what a source of grief it is to me. And when the 8ubjot is montiond, I am appealed to in such  ,    ,   a significant manner that I cannot fail to understand. Annie promise me that you will be silent for a while at least, and when you will speak out, let it be to me. jrr  Promise this Annie, for my sake. Will you Annie?" and in the earnestness of his feelings, he bent his form close to her, as if his eternal happiness depended on her answer, and his life hung on her decision. :I    Annie was mortal. She could not withstand such im- :J  portunities. She remained silent one minute, and then gave the verdict. I   "Mr. Sumner, I give you a promise of indefinite silence; this is all I can do now. Excuse me, I will see you again some other time. Good evening." In a second she was gone;. Her form flitted from the room like a vision, and Mr. Sumner was left alone. 1'4' CHAPTER XV. TE INVESTIGATIOG N CONTINUE, IN WHCH IT IS PROVEN THAT CIRCUMCISION SEALED NO SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS TO ANY ONE BUT ABRAHAM, BECAUSE:  "And HE (Abrathan) received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of the faith ohich HE had, being yet uncircumcised, that HE ntqght be the father of all them that be- lieve, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be impited to themn also."-Rom. iv: 11. RAIN, rain; oh murky clouds, rain on! Your ceaseless hum of dismal note adds a heavier shade of gloom to the soul oppressed with grief, and laved in deep calligation. Like the bruised heart that repeats its ills to feel the sting of remorse afresh, your continual and uneven roar, serves I    '^15  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC8270-00000088"/> to feed the longings for darker melancholy, instead of generating desires for sunshine. Rain, rain! Perhaps the gore of piercing thought may be washed from its pointed steel, which, dyed in tle heart's blood of happiness, is drawn forth crimsoned with this quivering vitality. The splashing water, as it beat its requiem on the window panes, gave congenial company to the solemn thoughts of Alnnie Bacon, as she sat the next morning in her room, awaiting the announcement of breakfast. Clouds'thick and dark, hung threatningly over the little town of M  ---; and the tall cliffs of the western barks of the Ohio, seemed for a moment to be mingling with their impenetrable bodies, which slowly drew themselves over the craggy. steeps, fretting the arched hills with a mourning hbue. The thunder appeared to choose its the- atre amidst the deep-echoing vales, and the lightning, as if to illuminate the caverns thereof, played its zigzag course, alternately among them, and on the pinnacles of the towering peaks above. Such scenes, Annie rather craved than otherwise, though they did not near mete with the extent of her sadness. She looked out on this panorama, and began to think strongly, that no convocation would be held at the Hall that day, for every sign gave promise of a rainy day. In this she was mistaken. Soon the -clouds began to clear away, and the sun burst forth in its usual efihlgence, the thousand rain-drops which lingered on the leaflets to sparkle like diamonds bathed in mid-day brilliancy. What a world of glory and beauty is revealed in the smiles of Nature! Even when she looks less propitious, there is wealth in her works for man to admire and utilize to his good, but it is seldom appreciated. The breakfast bell called Annie from her study. The meal was partaken of in silence. Mr. Bacon did not deign a remark. He was extremely sullen and unyield- ing in his nature, and now was the time for displaying such characteristics. He thought his daughter had erred, but could not deem it his duty to advise her, but would force her ifito right by silent treatment. This was indeed a very ineXpedient course; so it told, itself in after days. The hour of eight arrived, bringing a tolerably fair ap- pearance, as regarded weather. - I   Our disputants met at the Hall almost as early as com- moll. Mr. Sumner occupied a very imposing seat near a table, which was loaded with books. The task before him, he was impressed, was one of little trouble, so he did not  give himself much uneasiness. Dr. Boon sat facing him, in high expectation, for thise was a new subject to him, comparatively. "If I mistake not, gentlemen," said Mr. Sumner, "Mr. Weston has said that I cannot find any spiritual blessings in the great Abrahamic covenant. I think such an asser- tion has never been ventured before. What! no spiritual blessings in the covenant from which we recognize our Church as springing? The idea is preposterous!" "If it is so preposterous, Mr. Sumner, it can soon be righted. If-there were any spiritual blessings in that covenant for Abraham's seed, you must prove it before you dwell so long on the inaccuracy of my assertion. You must prove that they were to his seed according to flesh, directly." "Well, just let me read. It will speak for itself: "'And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to him, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God: walk before me and be thou perfect. And 1 will make my covenant (on6 covenant only) be-.  tween me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him saying, As for me, behold my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram; but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made  thee. And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and-to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will : be- their God. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you, and thy seed after thee. Every man child among you shall be circumcised.'--Gen. xvii: 1-10.   &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC8270-00000089"/> 17 22.    LEAND-ER HALL. "Here is the covenant, Mr. Weston, with all its preo cious promises, and sealed by the rite of circumcision. What could be plainer? It contains three distinct prom- ises. 1: A promise of a numerous natural seed, which has been fulfilled. 2: That his natural seed should pos- sess the land of Canaan, which has also been fulfilled. 3: That he should be a father of many nations; that in his - seed all the families of the earth should be blessed. This is the great promise of the covenant-the promise of spir- itual blessings to' all nations, through Jesus Christ, the promised seed, and is now being fulfilled. Circumcision sealed these blessings.' Then circumcision is a seal of spiritual blessings, and so is baptism. Hence the identity of Church."' "Didn't I say so? I knew it could be proeed! v  Why, Mr. Weston, your whole scheme is not worth a straw. Who. ever heard of such a thing as there being no spiiit- ual blessings in the Abrahamic covenant? I am surprised at you, sir. Here is the Saviour promised, and the prom- ise sealed by circumcision. What is that but a spiritual blessing? Do pray, Mr. Weston, don't make such a bare assertion again. You can't authenticate it, and you only appear the more ridiculous," addressed Mr. Bacon, hope- fully. "You will give up this 'point, won't you Mr. Weston? I can't see how you can help it," said Mr. Sumner. "(No 8ir, I do not. I admit that in the covenant was promised a numerous natural seed, but'I would ask you, was that promise to Abraham or to his seed?" "It was to Abraham. Many of Abraham's seed never w: had any descendants at all. To him only was the prom- ise of a numerous natural seed. No one can doubt this," replied Mr. Sumner, unsuspectingly. "Well, I'm glad you've answered it thus. That part is settled. That his natural seed should possess the land of Canaan. We agree on this point. Now the next: 'That he should be the father of many nations.' This, Mr. Sumner, you will admit, is the promise of spiritual bless- ings." "Yes sir, just so." "Well, God promised Abraham that HE should be the father of many nations. Did he promise his seed that they should be the fathers of many nations?"   THE INVESTIGATION.        178 "Oh no, no, Mr. Weston, Abraham is the father of the faithful, and Abraham only." "Then you admit that this spiritual blessing was to Abraham only?" "Yes, as far as being the father of many nations goes, it was to him only. No one can say that God promised Abraham's children, according to flesh or spirit, that they should be the fathers of many nations." Well, we have agreed so far. There is another fea- ture I must notice. I want to know wherein the cove- nant iust set before us, is the promise to Abraham that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed ()?" Oh Mr. Sumner, you were too fast!  "Tell me, sir, where in the covenant,God promised a seed to Abraham to bless the nations of the earth with'" He reflected a moment, puzzled beyond an answer. Then he summoned courage enough to reply; whether to the point ar not, hear: "He promised Abraham that he should be the father of many nations, and Paul says: 'Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end, the promise might be sure to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, -who is the father of us all, (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,)' &amp;c. Here it is evident the Apostle was referring to the promise which God made to Abraham, a promise that the Gentiles might come, as well as the Jews, in the covenant." "So I admit," said Mr. Weston, " but where do you get your authority for saying that God plronised Abraham in that covenant, that in his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed?' "Whiat is the difference between the promise that he should be the father of many nations, and in his seed should all the families of the earth be blessed? Are they not equivalent?  "No. The former is to Abraham perkonally, for his benefit only; the latter is for the benefit of the world. Now I admit that there were spiritual blessings in that. covenant, but they were only to Abraham. Thley were given him because. of his faith. Are all his seed faithful? The promise that ill his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed, is not in this covenant, but in one made  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC8270-00000090"/> 174       LEANDER' HALL. previously! (See Gen. xii: 3.) Hear what Paul has. to say on this sealing of spiritual blessings to Abraham on- ly: ' Ald he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that right- eousness might be imputed unto them also: and the fath- er of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcis- ion only, (that is, though they belong to the circumcised, they cannot claim spiritual parentage of Abraham on those grounds, for circumcision was no seal or sign of spiritual blessings to them,) but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had, 'being yet uncircumcised. For, the promise that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham or his seed through the law, (circumcision is of the law,) but through the righteousness of faith.' "What shall we deduce from this which I have just read?. First that the sign of circumcision was given to Abraham as a seal. Of what? A seal of righteousness, and the promise that he should become the father of the faithful. Here are two distinct blessings sealed by this sign, to Abraham only. It could not seal spiritual bless- ings to his seed, for it did not promise that they should be the fathers of many nations. It does not say it could seal any righteousness, for they are represented as being circumcised, and yet having no claims on Abraham as a spiritual father, only as they walked like others not cir- cumcised,' in the steps of that faith of our father Abra- ham, which he had, being yet uncircumcised. ' Furthermore, it is said' the promise was not through the law,' (circum- cision is of the lawr.) Now since it does not promise any spiritual blessings to his heirs according to the flesh, let us turn to the giving of that covenant, and see what good there is in it, for Abrahan's seed: ' And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession.' Here it is. Here is what is promised to the seed, according to the flesh, and to Abraham also. Here is another blessing sealed, or its promise, by circumcisioi, to Abraham. To Abraham alone does it seal the prom- ise. ' The sign' and' a seal' are two distinct applications. To Abraham it was a seal of spiritual and temporal bless.   THE INVESTIGATION.        17 ings-- a scal of his righteousness-a seal of the promise  that he sihould, be the father of many nations. A SEAL is a term denoting a special occurrence. Now pertaining to his seed, circumcision was THE SIrG that they shduld possess the land of Canaan. Mark it. There is no bless- ing in this covenant promised to Abraham's seed, but this temporal blessing. They had no more right to claim spiritual descent upon the plea of circumcision, than the Gentiles who had not been circumcised. Their right and that of all others claiming Abraham as their spiritual fath- er, must come from a 'walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had, being yet uncircumcised. For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void.' "As evidence of this, God in reminding the Jews of his covenant with Abraham, as concerning them, speaks 'of it thus: 'I have established my covenant with Abra- ham, Isaac and Jacob, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.  I have also heard the groanings of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have re- membered my' covenant. ' Wherefore say unto the chil. dren of Israel, I am the Lord, and will bring you out from  -under the bondage of the Egyptialns-and I will take you unto me for a people, and I will be unto you a God-and I will bring you unto the land concerning which I sware to give it to' Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you for a heritage.' WThis is the ex- tent of the promise to Abraham's seed in that covenant,  or in speaking of it, why was not the other blessings mentioned?  "Again: Isaac in blessing Jacob, speaks in this single style too, which is strange, if there had been other bless-  ings. 'God Almighty bless thee, and give the blessing  of Ablraham to thee-and to thy seed with thee, that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.' All this is very peculiar in  style, if there had been other blessings connected with the promise of land. The above passages speak very much like that, in that covenant, the land was all that  the Jews claimed. Strange .that in speaking of the cov- enant made with Abraham, God did not repeat some oth-. er promise to the Jews, if in that qovenant he designed any- Yii  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC8270-00000091"/> 176       LEANDER HALL. thing but land inheritance. He repeats that he would give them Canaan for a possession, but makes no intimation of any spiritual blessing. . Isaac, in blessing Jacob; why did he not invoke some spiritual gift when he made men- tion of the promise, on which they predicated their hope t of restoration? Because he knew that it contained none for them. Hence what it contained for Abraham was not-for them. There was but one promise to Abraham in connection with his seed, and that was the land of Ca. naan. So clearly did the Jews understand it this way, '+- that upon entering the land of Calnaan after Moses' death, Joshua circumcised all the male children that were born during their sojourn in the wilderness, before they would enter the promised land. Now the number had become very numerous, and the task a painful one indeed, one to be revolted at by the mind uninfluenced by God's com- mands, but they knew that it was the sign of their inherit- ance, consequently not a murmur was heard. But I am taking too much, time. One more thought and I am done. Since circumcision is not a sign of spiritual bless- ings, it cannot -be the predecessor of baptism, nor can it be termed a door to the Church, while baptism is; hence the impossibility of identity of Chti&amp;dc." Mr. Sumner remained silent. Mr. Weston availed him- self of his siletce, and proceeded. "Allow me to violate my promise so far as to read an- other passage from the Scriptures to prove that circum- cision was no sign of spiritual blessings to Abraham's seed. Perhaps, Mr. Sumner, you have heard it before: 'Stand fast therefore in the lilerty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. For I tes- tify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is A debtor to do the whole law. Christ is become of no ef- feet unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. "It strikes me very forcibly, had circumcision been a sign of spiritual blessings, or had there been any spirit- ual blessings to Abraham's seed in the. covenant sealed by circumcision, the Apostle, would not have spoken of it in this manner. The covenant is before us, my friends. We have not been able to find one single spiritual bless:   THE INVESTIOATION.        1" ing to Abraham's seed, of the flesh. It promised noth- ing to us. It promised much to Abraham, so much so that his name was changed. There are but three prom- ises in the whole covenant, directly or indirectly, and all of them are to Abraham. Only one in connection with his seed, either of the spirit or flesh, and that is to the seed according to the flesh. And of temporal blessings only. Not that all are excluded from spiritual blessings, but there were none in that covenant for them, as sealed by circumcision." "Right here Mr. Weston, I would ask you a question. In reading from Paul Rom. iv: 11-14, you made it ap- pear that circumcision was a law to the Jews, and then you said it was a seal of promises to Abraham; now how can you make it thus, with any consistency? How could it become a law of nationality, (which I presume  you meant, as you would not sufier it to be a sign of spiritual blessings,) and a seal of spiritual blessings to  Abraham? Ii this intelligent company such a theory  will not take."  "No, Bro. Sumner, it would not," exclaimed -,Mr. Ba- con; ," I thought the gentleman certainly would see his error. What, circumcission a law of carnalities to one, and a seal of spiritual blessing to another? Such a gross inconsistency does away entirely with your theory,' - and  the old man's eye twinkled with delight. Mr. Bacon \'as old and somewhat childish in his notions and ways; he did not fail to crow over every little advantage gained. You must answer that question Mr. Weston, .or your scheme falls through. You love consistencies, now prac- tice them," said M r. Sumner again, half ironically. "I intend answering before we proceed further sir. As I have' proven, circumcision meant one thing to Abra- ham, and another to his seed, you want to know why it should do this?"  'Yes sir, that is the point I cannot understand."  "Well allow me to ask you a few questions. What was the sign of the circumcission given to Abraham in the first place for?"  "Because, as he had believed in God,- against many seeming improbabilities, it was given to insure a recome n pense.," t  "Then it was a sign of the reward, you admit. You'll  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8270-00000092"/> 178      LEAN D TER UAIL L. agree that- it sealed the promise that nHE should be the father of many nations?" "Certainly I will; it sealed that promise, because ho "ad been so faithful to God." "Now I'd ask you, -could it seal a like promise to his children?" Mr. Sumner did not know. Mr. Weston proceeded. "This is the reason why it sealed one thing to Abra- ham, and was the sign of another to his children. They had done nothing to deserve such a blessing as the for- mer, therefore it was not. given to them. Abraham had, and moreover in addition to this, a promise was given hiim that his seed should possess the land of Caanan, and circumcission bacame the siqn. and a law unto the Jews because to them it consisted of temporalities alone. God says: 'And the unoircumcised mian child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from among his people, he hath broken my .covenant,'- he hath no part-in the promise. We find then that cir- cumcission was n6t a voluntary duty, but a command-a law. Right here comes up an infallible argument in favor of the theory that circumcision was a sign of tem- poral blessings only, to the seed of Abraham. 'And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circum- cised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one born in the land; for no .uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. ' "Allow a few reflections here. You will admit, Mr. Sumner, that the passover was a commemoration of tem- poral blessing?" "Of course sir." "The temporal blessing was a passing over the first born of the Jews, and the slaying of the first born of the Egyptians, which caused Pharoah to let the Hebrews go that self-same night, out of bondage, towards the lan'd of promise. This you must admit, Mr. Sumner?" '*'Of course sir." "'Then the passover was a fulfillment of the promise: (And I will give unto. thee, and to thy seed. after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession,' &amp;c., whichi we see could not be celebrated without circumncision, and which   THE INVESTIGATION.        179 goes to prove inevitably that it was the sign of this tem- poral blessing." When Mr. Weston paused, Mr. Sumner knew not what to say. He was non plus now as well as ne plus. Mr. Bacon moved near a window and threw up the sash. The weather was very warm. Perhaps theology had increased the temperature in heat. Mr. Sumner rallied. "But sir, you did not notice the point I made in quo- ting the 16th and 17th verses from the 4th chapter of Romans. 'Therefore, it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations.') Here you observe the Apostle refers to the covenant of circumcision as containing the promise of spiritual blessings to the Gentiles as well as the Jews." "I think Mr. Sumner you have overlooked the point. Now, what was this promise?  Was it that any one should be the father of many nations but Abraham? Most assuredly not. Now  to the end, the promise, might be sure to all the seed; that is tosay, wheth- er under the law  or not; he should be, the father of all that believed. The promise was not to the chil- dren but to Abraham. 'As it is written, I have made thee a father of 'many nations.' So much for that. The promise is still to Abraham! - Now I ask you again, Mr. Sumner, to show me in that covenant one spiritual blessing for any one but Abraham?" "Why sir, the promise that we'shall be the children of Abraham is enough." "But that is not promised to us in the covenant. Abra- ham is promised by God that he shall be the father of all that believe, but you have acknowledged that the prom- ise was to Abraham personally. Where is the promise of spiritual blessings to any one in that covenant but to Abraham, .again I ask? It will never be found. Cir- cnmcision has never sealed aimy spiritual blessings to any one but Abraham. It sealed the righteousness, of faith which HE had before being uncircumcised. Could it seal'the right- eousness of what others did not possess? It sealed the promise that HE shouldbe the father. of manyl natiQos,  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC8270-00000093"/> 180       LEANDER HALL. Could it seal that promise to others, when it never was made to others?- Lastly the sign of the promise was that he and his seed according to the flesh should possess the land of Canaan, which is typical of his spiritual seed's possession of the Heavenly Canaan. Hence the incon- gruity of the theory of baptism coming in the place of circumcision. Baptism is a sign of spiritual blessings, it is the door of the Christian Church. Circunicission is no sigmnof spiritual blessings to the - Seed; yot say it' was the door of the Jewish Church. So here identity is done away with. Infants may have belonged to the Jewish Church and yet have no claims to the Christian Church since they are not identical." Mr. Sumner did not feel very well from his looks. He was certainly much perplexed or indisposed. "It was very fortunate sir," continued Mr., Weston, seeing that he kept silent, "that you did not prove the identity of the Abrahamic covenant and Christian Church, since in that covenant there is no promise of a Messiah. Men may construe it as they will, but what was promised to Abraham was done by virtue of his faith, and to him only. There is no intimation of a Mes- siah in that covenant. He was promised before that. Abraham had believed against improbabilities, and God in remuneration for that faithfulness, promised him per- sonal and spiritual blessings first, and then promised tem- poral blessings to himself and his natural seed. In the cov- enant no requisition at all is made of his seed,only that they be circumcised. Of Abraham there was made the requi- sition,-'Walk before me -and be thou perfect.' Men may make of this covenant whiat they will, but it is before us in its simplicity." Mr. Sumner felt the force of argument. He put him- self to study. Could there be no reply made? He picked up a book and began to whirl the leaves over rapidly to divert attention from his confusion and lack of argu- ment. "Have you anything more to say, Mr. Sumner, on this point  If not we will close," said-Mr. Weston. "I might say a great deal Mr. Weston, but you would misconstrue it." :"Misconstrue it? I cannot understand! You must ex- plain yourelf Mr. Sumner. If you bring up any scriptu-   THE INVESTIGATION.        181 ral proof, I dare not touch it. I would not for the world take a passage of scripture and misconstrue its meaning. -Ihave no right to do it; neither have you, nor any one else. God's word is too precious for us to tamper with." "Oh I did not mean that Mr. Weston, but you have your way of thinking about this matter, and so have I. We Ought, I think to enjoy our opinions in peace." !   "I was enjoying mine quietly until called out on this very important subject. But according to the theory ad- vanced by yourself, we ought to let the- heathen enjoy his false notions about worshiping God. The theory stands as good in one case as the other. It is my motto to discountenance heresy wherever I find it, though I do not carry it out practically. I only fight against it when I am attacked, which you all know was the case in this instance." Dr. Boon fearing some unpleasant feeling might spring up from this channel of conversation, interrupted them. "Gentlemen it is late. The time is wearing out. If there is anything more to be said, you had better hurry, or the subject will be separated for the want of time." "Mr. Sumner, I presume has nothing more to say now, have you?" asked Mr. Weston turning to him. "No sir, let the subject pass. If I cannot establish in- fant baptism on this plan, I know I can find it in the New Testament, in so many clear instances that you cannot dispute it." "But I do not want to leave this subject entirely yet. It would indeed be leaving a very incomplete arrange- ment. I want the privilege in our next meeting, of in- troducing some argument in favor of my position. Do you grant it gentlemen?" "Of course," said Dr. Boon, seeing that Mr. Sumner did not intend makingo any reply. That is, so far as I am concerned. What do you say to it Mr. Sumner? Do you give your consent?" "Yes, I have no objections," was the very week acqui- escence. It was agreed that Mr. Weston might introduce any amount of argument to prove a non-identity of Churches, he might see proper. He had too much feeling to ask Mr. Sumner to give up his grounds (though he did,) in fulfillment of previous stipulations.  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC8270-00000094"/> Mr. Sumner-had failed signally. He knew it and felt it keenly. His only hope now was the New Testament, and of that he could but entertain an indefinable pre- sentiment of its shortcoming, as to his expectations. CHAPTER XVI. ELDER TAYOR'S VISIT TO M-. HE MAKES AN APPEAL TO ANNIE BACON'S FEELINGS IN WHCH SHE IS SEVERELY TRIED, BUT IS DECIDED BY. -"If ye love me, keep MY commandments." St. John xiv. 5. THE bright summer sunset, had just played its charms in golden hues, on the western horizon. Each little frag- ment of cloud had bathed itself in the flood Of glory, flung from the receding sun. It was Saturday evening, preceding Mr. Sumner's day in M---. Annie stood in the front veranda, enjoying the beauty of the evening. The busy hubbub of the town aroseever and anon,sometimes in tones of galliardness-the hue from some throng of truant boys, and hallooing of some personage, whose lungs perhaps, were his strongest or- gans. The prosecution of the investigation had been sus- pended until the next week. In hope of, ameliorating the fatal impressions which the existence of a few weeks had made. Mr. Sumner had written a letter to the Pre- siding Elder of C--, begging him to come to M-- and talk with his betrothed, for signs were becoming, in- dicative of troublesome times. It was underst9od that his visit should be made one of accident. He arrived on   Saturday evening, late in the day. Mr. Sumner hastened to pay his respects to the Brother, and urged on him the immediate necessity for action. Nor were his fears un- founded. So while Annie stood musing on the sunset glories, Bro. Taylor walked in through the gate, in his stiff white-neck tie, and starched collar. His Wteps. kept time with his gold-headed cane, which glittered as it brought the strag- gling rays of the departing sun, to a bright focus, on the  terminus of its length.  "Ahem," he cleared his throat, as he walked slowly up the pavement, for he had seen Annie and began to dread the task. He adjusted his hat nervously, and planted his cane unnecessarily hard, in absentmindedness, as the subject before him engrossed his whole mind. ' He reached the portico.  How do you do, Mr. Taylor?" said she, rising and of- fering her hand. ("It ought to have been Bro. Taylor," thought he, but said nothing.) "Why how do you do, Sister Annie? You are look- ing pensive and serious, what were you contemplating? No doubt a love dream," he laughingly added as he took his seat.  Annie blushed.  "I will tell father you are here," she said rising from her seat. One moment for decision. Must; he now approach her on the subject or wait?"Now, now," suggested the  spirit. "Stay, Sister Annie. I would talk with you awhile.  Be seated; your father will come. out directly." There was a slight agitation in his tone. A perceptible  tremor ran through Annie's frame. She seated herself, but could not command courage, for the object of his visit flashed over her mind, and then the suspjcion was cor- roberated by his tell-tale manners.  It had required a bold effort of Mr. Taylor to intro-  duce, or make known the purpose of his visit, though she werebut a young girl. "Sister Annie," he began, first casting a glance at her,  and then towards the river, "I have been pained by some Very sad intelligence here of late. (He gathered cour-   &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8270-00000095"/> atim'      JD' A x v J K - -." a age.) I am told that you have become very much dissat- isfied, with-(he hated to say the Methodist Church) your religious principles; is it so." "As to my principles," she replied without hesitation, "they are the instigation of my disaffection, with the Methodist Church. I will state them Bro. Taylor (he hailed the Brother as a good sign,) so we may understand each other. I know Mr. Sumner is the' cause of your present visit-I may thank him for this honor," she added pausing a moment. Mr. aylor colored up. He knew it too. 4' Go on and let me hear the source of your trouble. -I have alwaya been taught Bro. Taylor, to look on close-comlmunion as one of the most abhorrent principles, that any Christian Church could practice, until very re- cently, my mind has undergone a change on the subject. I now believe itto be a consistent principle and com- metidable in any denomination, which claims to be the true Church of Christ. At first Mr. Taylor, (she did not Brother him now, she had begun to think,) was confi- dent in my ignorance that the Methodist Church was the Church of Christ. Since then, things have developed themselves to me, of which before I was totally ignorant. And now I must say in your presence, Mr. Taylor--in the presence of one of her Elders, that I think she (the Methodist Church) is much deficient t-And worse, she is clinging to a hateful institution of the Pope! What must think of her?"  Mr. Taylor was not prepared for this. It was too pointed. He sprang from his seat. and walked across the portico several times in perplexity. At last he spoke. ( Sister, you have fallen ilito a grievous error about this. Some one has been instructing you (he meant Mr. Wes- ton no doubt,) who is entirely ignorant of the matter. You ought to have heard the testimony of both sides. "I did Mr. Taylor. Mr. Sumner and Mr. Weston have disputedthat matter in my presence, very thoroughly. Mr. Weston proved from your own men, that sprinkling was instituted by the Pope, and first recognized as valid by his will and authority." "Oh well, Mr. Weston bropght up some old Baptist's testimony to that effect. You ought not to suffer your- self to be blinded by such evidence. I warrant you, he , .      b   TH E, IN VE 8 T GAT-I ON.     t read from Andrew Fuller and Carson half of his time." He tried by his nonchalant tone, to affect something-in the absence of truth. Annie was astonished at this cool audacity. For onlesecond she felt the greatest antipathy to him, but she considered the desperation of his cause and made allowances. She looked him in the face and replied:  "I think Mr. Taylor you are priesuming much on Mr. Sumner's ignorance by saying what you have. He cer-  tainly ought to have known whether Fuller or Carson, were quoted to prove that sprinkling was of popish ori- gin." "Excuse me Sister Annie," he addressed her in a-very conciliatory tone. "I had forgotten that you said Bro. Sumner waspresent, and I had also overlooked the fact that ladies are very jealous of their lovers' name." By making this referencehe hoped to call her attention from the point they were discoursing, and to force a smile. In both he failed.  "Besides," said Annie, determined to pursue the sub- ject, "It was proven to my satisfaction from the Bible- the infallible guide, that immersion is the proper mode. I no longer consider sprinkling or pouring valid. There- fore the Methodist Church has no right to commune, nor have I. It is not. the true Church of Christ. I do not belong to the true Church of Christ, hence the sum of my irreconciliation. I want to find that true Church Mr.  Taylor. I want to find a pattern of the divine model. Wherever it is, and whatever it is. I will join it at all hazards. But perhaps I've said too much. I intended to have remained silent for a length of time, but you have called me out. Will you excuse me now? I will send father out." *"NTo, n, stay," he pleaded, for he had effected nothing as yet, and he did not feel like going back to Mr. Sumner without better tidings.

"You know Sister Annie, the wife of an itinerant is subjected to many deprivations, but I know you are fully competent to such a task. Bro.

Should you execute your threat, his heart Would be broken, and the prospective usefulness of yourself in connection with him, forever blighted. I know this, Sister Annie. I know his feelings, and the depth of his love. Will you not sacrifice your undue scruples for his sake, and for the sake of the cause, which he has espoused? He would do as much for you. Do you love him less? I want you to think of this and weigh the subject wcll, for it is indeed of serious import," he pleaded with the combined earnest- ness and eloquence of his nature. "Oh Bro. Taylor, I have never before thought of this in- the light which you have portrayed. I am not capa- ble of considering as I ought," she replied, in tea.:s. "But I want you to promise me one thing. Will you do it?" "What is it?" "As he loves you so devotedly and would make any sacrifice for you, that you promise to make one for him.

"I will, send father out," and she was gone ere lie knew of her intention. Mr. Taylor was elated with his success, but was not as well satisfied, as if she had made a definite promise. !   IIowever, lie thought he had made an impression which could not be eradicated.  I  -Just then Mr. Bacon accidentally passed through the hall; hearing his voice, he stept out. Mr. Taylor received a hearty greeting. Of all persons he was most welcome.. '"When did you arrive at M-  Bro. Taylor?" asked Mr. Bacon, as they walked in the library together. "Not an hour ago. I staid down in town only a few moments. "Are you on your way to the Quarterly, or did you make this visit your only object in coming down? Asked Mr. Bacon eagerly.  "I have some business down here. I thought I would come down to your meeting, as I, had to come to the place any how? Ilow is your health here of late?" he asked, clhanging the subject.-  "My health is very good, I thank you." Mr. Taylor wanted to call attention from the circum- stance of his visit, so to change the subject was the only expedient. There was a silence of a few mor/ments, in which the Eider was very anxious, to hear how the discussion was progressing, but was afraid to ask. Mr. Bacon seemed to have anticipated him. "Ias brother Sumner kept you posted this week?" "No, he promised to do so, but he has been very negli- gent ol that score'." "What's the prospect?'  "Not as bright as it might be.

More than that; I thank you deeply for what you have done. I cannot ex- press my gratitude," he said rising and taking his hand. "But tell me, do you think she will be hushed in the fu- ture? She is very, very persistent in her notions." "I have reasons to believe that she repents bitterly,  that is, if tears are any sig, for she shed a very copious shower before I was half done talking' to her. -At first she got the upperhand of me, but at last I talked her into penitence. I think her repentance is deep and pungent. Only leave her to herself and I predict she will not fall away again." Here the coiversation was interrupted, by the en- trance of a boy with the mail. There was nothing for Mr. Bacon but the "Christian Advocate," a periodical published in defence of tie great Methodist Discipline. In the meantime Annie sought her room, and in the paroxysml of her grief, tlirew ferself on her bed, sobbing violently. The fountain was touched; thl flowing of the deep waters, thereof was a relief. Tears sufficed for awhile; but at last thought began to work, in essaying an egress from the intricuat mass of perplexities, which had so unexpectedly surrounded her, Within the last few mo- ments. Once she imagined that Mr. Taylor was right, but the words of our Savior, just at that point, came to  her mind-"He that lovethl father or mother more thanl  me, is not wortly of me," so the whole plan, fabricated of animal sympathies, was reduced to a mere heap of apocryphal dogmas, and she resolved that since Cnrist- had said, If you love me, keep MY commandments," to brave the opposition and obey him before mein. Where is the individual that has come to this conclu- sion, who has not achieved victory over the enemies of the Savior's injunctions, 'and triumphed over the heart's struggles of false delicacy? Observations are for us, and experience also throws in her mite to corroborate this  theory.  Annie Bacon did not look like the same being when she went down after candlelight.

MYlr. Taylor and Mr. Bacon -observed this change and at- tributed it to a resolution to abandon the disturbiingdere- lictions which brooded so much discontent, and resume her old path of duty and rectitude. Mr. Taylor was sanguine; Mr. Bacon was no lens, pleased. Both cngaged unreservedly in a lively conver- sation, enforcing rejoinders on Annie. She saw and com- prehended the mistake. Once she was on the eve of cor- recting their misconceived impressions, but Mr. Taylor's volubility hindered her. In fact he monopolized the con- versation completely. Mr. Bacon in his delight, being satisfied in responding occasionally in monosylables, or seconding a notion -now and then by a " thats so, or "the fact,' or that's just my way of thinking, Bro Tay- lor." The Presiding Elder made himself extremely agreeable that evening jHis mission was of conciliation, and well did he act his part. At ten he took out his watch and announced his intention of leaving. Mr. Bacon demurred persistently, but the Brother had promised Mr. Sumner to stay with him that night, so must be excused. He was anxious also to get back to communicate his unparalleled success (as he thought,) to the interested lover. He did not say as much, but Annie read his thoughts in too legible actions, to be mistaken. She must undeceive; but how? Revolving such thoughts in her mind, she was in the act of interrupting the traiP of conversation, when he arose abruptly, as if recollect- ing the tidings which he was to bear back, and left with- out giving her time to intimate such a thing. She could but feel some compunction that night when sie retiredeto her room, it -having suffered such impres- sions to go uncorrected-but kept her council, having no one to whom she could reveal the secret. She could not approach her father on that subject-she dared not. The only chance was to await further devel- opments, of the investigation, and shape her course, by its turn,  Sabbath morning came, as productive of the usual preaching day of the Methodists, in M--. The rumor of Mr. Taylor's arrival had called out all the noncombatants, and most of the members fromother   T    If VR 8 Tr AT1ioi. 0T191      denominations, so the house was full. Mr. Taylor wasan ffible man, and by this, he had gained favorwith^ many, autside of the influence of his religious -roYensities,'--n' fict it had been, the main propeller of his popularity ;- the lever powelr, by which he had turned the world, over to his favo r. Miss Matilda Lankinston was there, inrthe ostentation of her religious show, occupying a very conspicuous seat in the "amen cornel"She was rejoicing in her mere- bership!-.-with the society set up by unconverted men!!t and, peferred this over Christ's Church, which was formed  by the unerring Vwisdom. of Diety!ed She was stabbingTruth by her influences and loried in the occupation! The commandments of our Savior iwere ringing in her ears, in plainest language, but she chose those of men! Yes, pawning the jewels .of the Church, for the dross of earth! I stand amazed at such abominations! How hushed she the voice of our Savior, when he cried at every struggle on the cross in strems of atoning blood, "If You love me keep My command- ment?"And can it be remembered td6 often?. iNdh Me thinksit should be caught up by each advocate, and proclaimed, until every nonconformist of this globe heeds this heavenly admonition. Mr. Taylor called his whole powers into requisition that day. He dwelt long on the saints--the fathers of the Methodist polity, and the mothers of her intfncy, as how they were shouting their alleluias around the thronfe f glory. They were saved, they were happy, what more could be asked?--was there any more promised  ie preached up the dead, instead of a resu'rected Christ, as though salvation was of our departed firiends, instead of Jesus the Savior. Where is the heart that is i so hard, that will not weep when the recollection of a dead mother, or a near friend, is called up, in the habilia- ments of nmourning with heartrending appeals? But is this preaching Christ? Is the praying to the holv Virgi!n Mary, or any ther saints much worse? Did Christ in Rivilig ris commission say, "Go preach, the departed saintS to the people, call up the ondemnd depict the horrors of their suffering, in order that men may be a ved.

All what innovations have been made in the practice of this commission! Scar.,ely a semblance of its former self, is to be recognized, in some of its pro- tended advocates. ' The congregation was in tears. At what? At the body of Christ, portrayed, hanging and bleeding on the  cursed tree? No; but at an imaginative picture of de- parted friends. That was preaching the Gospel in true anglican style. (!) After the services were over, Miss Matilda placed herself in the way of the door to intercept Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sumner. She was determined that they slould dine with her that day. Resistance wasuseless. She had prepared dinner and go they must. Of course the preachers could not withstand such importunate requisitions; so they went. Miss Matilda lived with an aunt who had no more use for religion, than she imagined a wagon would for five wheels; and I venture to say, less for preachers. How- ever, it dil not devolve on the aunt to entertain them, but Miss Matilda was called out" on this occasion. During the evening the conversation fell on close corm- munion. Mr. Sumner was sick of the subject and left it with the Elder and Miss Matilda, while he amused him- self with a book. "I want to hear you talk on that subject Bro. Taylor," said she, as her chair was accidently moved towards him. You know how unpleasant It is to have our friends dif- fering with us on this point. Indeed I cannot' imagine how two could get along at all, who differed in this par- ticular." She meant this for Mr. Sumner's ears. Her object was to suggest the impossibility of his and Annie's happiness when such was in the way. "Indeed Sister, I think the case is manifest without any elucidation. Every body, yes the world, all know and feel the unchristianlike spirit of such a thing, but the Baptists, and they appear to think, no one can be right but them. Where they ever got such notions I cannot think. I know that such are not taught in the Bible.-  And so do I. .Tht flkes it ten times worse.

"I think, said Mr. Taylor, after a moment's pause, "we had better go home, and leave her to herself for a while, at least." But what good can come of it? If she is decided neither time or anything elsewillchange her. Do you think she is?"           that showed it "Yes; I dent think I ever saw any one that showed it plainer than she did. She looked resigned too."   -'Then I am glad, for I did not want her to acquiesce unless she was entirely willing. I did not want it from -her lips merely, but from her heart. Must we go?  Mr. Taylor reflected a moment. He had some vague presentiment. He could not account for his reluctance  of feeling to going there, so he did not decide to go - "Isuggest Bro. Sumner, that we leave her to herself.  If you insist I will go, but I think wehad better stay away  this evening. You will see her to-morrow, then you can talk with her." "Well, just as you say. However there is one conso- lation ahead of me."  "What is it?" "I won't feel so uneasy about the impressions this dis- cussion might make." "But you must not let that fact make you less vigilent in defending our cause."  "Oh no, no, not at all!" he replied blushing at his mis.' take. "I meant, even if I don't come .out as well as 8 might, I have not so much at stake."  "But you have the cause of Christ at stake," suggested Mr. Taylor again, reprovingly.  Mr. Sumner took care to profit by the hint given by his Brother. We are sorry to say the main object of his efforts were to sustain his cause sufficiently to save  Annie. Mr. Taylor preached in M-- that night. The net    7 morning he left bright and early for C----. Many were the conjectures as to the object of his visit, but it was such a secret that the town failed that time to get hold of .the facts. Defeat a place the size of M---- in such a purpose and it may be counted a greater battle than that of Thermopylhe. Suspicions of course ran swiftly, but nothing well  founded was determined.  Things grew better at Leander Hall since Mr. Bacon had imbibed the impression that Annie was reconciled. That evening at tea he treated her with more respect than he had done for several weeks.           i Annie had scruples about allowing these impressions  to remain, but she dared not approach her father on the  subject, for she felt like it would be certain excitement,  or something equivalent.

She was at all ieeided as to which was the true Church of el  a rist. Mr. Sumner had told her that the Baptist Church s deficient: she was not posted. She felt like corn- anion belonged to the true Church of Christ, and that one had a right to commune who did not belong to at Church. She knew that baptism by immersion was e initiatory act of that Church, but she was not certain at it was the Baptist, since she had been told that in- at baptism was of that Church by one in whom she put e utmost confidence, so she thought that difficulty was lough to depose that Church of the title.

For in Isaac shall thy seed be called."-Gen. xvii: 21, xxi; 12. EALry Monday morning Leander Hall was again. a place of convocation. There had gone out such an in- terest in the town of M---, that several of the citizens had determined to be present at the furtherance of the discussion. Although it was a private affair, they man- aged to gain admittance, or rather invitations from some one of the party concerned, which was very readily done. Many more might have been added had-not their pride and party spirit been a draw back. But this is always  the way; men will crush natural anxiety for prudence and policy, aind smother truth for pride. Several of the Reformation, and one Methodist corn- posed the new addition. On some of the, points at issue i the Campbellites agreed with Mr. Weston, though they did not offer any assistance.  To-day he was to introduce evidences of the non-iden- tity of the old Jewish organization, with the Christian Church.  Be it remembered that Mr. Sumner had given this point ip, but Mr. Weston was desirous of making his theory more apparent.  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC8270-00000102"/> Mr. Sumner did not seat himself near tne taoie or oks for he felt that he had no use for them, since he d signally failed with their assistance. Mr. Stuart, Mr., Senms, and Mr. Rowlin (the new ad- ions,) gathered closely around, in order to hear every )rd. Mr. Weston began: "Mr. Sumner, I wish you to state once more the skel- rn of the Jewish organization, so that these gentlemen So have just come in may understand the force of my gument. Will you do it" Certainly, sir. The great Abrahamic covenant, we d, is sealed by circumcision, a Jewish miark. All that ere ever admitted into the Jewish Church, were circum- 3ed. Children were circumcised into that Church, which identical with the Christian Church-so children must ; brought into the Christian." "But," interrupted Dr. Boon, "H thought, Mr. Sumner, at you gave up that doctrine last week, and concluded go to the New Testament for your next argument.  "Well, so I did. I'm now complying with Mr. Wes- n's request. I must say here, I do not believe the round advocated, and relied on by our brethren to estab-  sh infant baptism. I know, however, that it was prac-  ced by the Apostles; that is sufficient evidence for me."  Mr. Weston said nothing to this, as it was not in  lacee.                - "Your theory was, that all that were circumcised, were F that Church, if I mistake not, Mr.,Sumner." "Yes sir." . Well, now let me see. I think you teach that bap- sm comes in the room of circumcision; that is, as cir- umcision was the door of the Jewish Church, baptism, which is the door of the Christian Church, must come in s. place. This is the doctrine, I believe, as near as 1 an come at it. Is it not?" "- something equivalent," was the brief reply. ," Now let us look into the particular differences: "1. Circumcision was designed only for males. Then 'fitwerethe door to the Jewish Church, feniales were ex- uaded. Both males and females are baptized. "' 2. There were no spiritual blessings sealed by circum-    it was a national mark to the seed, and as men had gov- ernments and nationalities in their hands, circumcision was only for them. Women did not rule in Israel. ". Adults circumcised themselves at any age, or when- ; ever they determined to ally themselves to the Jewish nation. Persons wishing to unite with the Christian Church, do not baptize themselves-another non-identical feature. "4. It was the law for infant males to be circumcised on the eighth day. Are children baptized on the eighth day? "5. Tnfants were circumcised by their parents, as in the case of Zipporah. Do parents who are not ministers, baptize their children? Does a mother ever baptize her infant? "6. Circumcision was an obligation of property. A Jew was compelled to circumcise his servants. Abraham circumcised his warriors which were at one time three hundred and eighteen. Do Pedobaptists baptize their servants, and do Pedobaptist Generals baptize their troops? Certainly not. Hence another obstacle in ident- ity. "7. The qualification for circumcision was flesh. Is . the qualification for baptism flesh? Is that the requisi- tion for Christ's Church? None can enter that Church without being 'born again,' and born from above,' not 'of the will of the ftesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.' Did circumcision require this? Is there any ident- ity here    . "8. Circumcision was not used as a dedicatory rite. With Pedobaptists, baptism is. Under the law, only the first born, if itwerea male, was dedicated, and not by cir- cumcision either. Pedobaptist dedicate both male and female, and by baptism!  "9. Christ was, circumcised the eighth day, dedicated the fortieth, and baptized in the river Jordan when thirty years old! Strange identity!  "10. Circumcision was a visible mark; Is sprinkling or immersion visible marks? Are they to be seen after administration??! "11. Circumcision was not a mark binding on children,  but on parents. On whom is baptism binding        -a  j!  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC8270-00000103"/> 4V"V      - "12. Circumcision was not dependent on the piety or faith of the parent. Pedobaptist say that baptism is. The infant of the most impious Jew had as much right to be circumcised as the children of Moses, Daniel, David,  or Abraham himself. "13. Circumcision, so say the Pedobaptists, guaranteed certain spiritual blessings to the Jews. If so, what spir- itual blessings does baptism promise infants? Are all saved that are baptized? And are anysaved by virtue of their baptism!? "14. Circumcision was not performed in any name. Why then baptize or sprinkle in any name, if the latter fills the former? "15. He that was circumcised was a debtor to do the whole law: 'Whosoever among you is circumcised, is a debtor to do the whole law' of which circumcision was  part. Are infants baptized, debtors to observe the ordi nances  "16. If circumcision were a sign of spiritual blessing,  why was the circumcised Jew baptized? Or why was Christ baptized? He had committed no sin to be repent-  ed of, and he had been circumcised!  "17. If circumcision were the door of the Church be- fore Christ, and baptism came in its place, why was Timotheus circumcised after having been baptized into the Church of Christ? 'Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him, because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew that his father was a Greek.' What! two doors into the Church of Christ? Two initiatory acts! Circumcis- ion may have been a door into the Jewish Church, but Christ's Church, never! Hence the impossibility of ident- ity. The Jews were circumcised. Why initiate them into the Church by baptism, if they had been already circumcised into the Church? Why two doors to the same Church? They were not the same Church, I af- firm, and will ever so affirm. "18. Since the two Churches differ in so many partic- ulars, and since we can find none in which they agree, we must conclude that they were no more identical than the land of Canaan, was identical with the heavenly, Canaan, or the Jerusalem of earth, identical with the heavenly Jerusalem.   "19. To say that the Jewish organization-with its   E circumcision, altars, priests, sacrifices, oblations, taberna- cles, festivals, holidays, new-moons, tithes, lents, temples, timbrels, harps, cornets, vestments, views, fedlings, pray- ers, praises, divers washings and cleansings, sacrifices, or  burnt offerings, and a thousand of other burdensome cer-  emonies-to say that that organization is identical with the Christian, would be equal to saying that the blood of bulls and goats is the same as Christ's blood? Or the Paschal Supper identical with the Lord's Supper! "20. That they differ in these respects, is evident; then baptism and circumcisiondiffer in their design, manner, operation, subjects and nature, fundanenntally. Hence sim- . ilarity is not identity. "' 21. If the old Jewish organization were the same as the Christian Church, what became of the Ishmaelites? They were circumcised. Did they belong to the'prom- ise 'In Isaac shall thy seed be called.' They might have had a right to the immunities belonging to circum- cision, but to the promise of a Saviour through the flesh, they had none. "22. Lastly, if circumcision were the door of the Jew- ish Church, and if that and the Christian are identical, why did not the Jews who had been circumcised into the Church, commune on the day of Pentecost, with the Christian Church?!! I leave the named impossibilities with you, my friends," concluded Mr. Weston. The evidence brought up was overwhelming, and equal- ly unanswerable. Mr. Sumner, though he had surrendered that point, could not enjoy its death-knell as others might. - Mr. Bacon was never willing to give up. He could not sit still in his chair. The whole affair had grown to be a misery to him, but he could not answer the argument brought up, so he reconciled himselfwith the promise that it would be better when they came to the New Test- ament. That was their only hope now, and by rights it should have been their only hope at first. This way of going to the Old Testament for ordinances andLcreeds be- longing wholly and exclusively to the New, is like going to monarchical governments for testimony in favor of re- publicanism. But Pedobaptists will do it, for they ima- gine that the Christian Church, which was first set up .   : '  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC8270-00000104"/> visibly in the days of John, was the same old Jewish or- ganization of rites and ceremonies! They forget /that the command to circumcise has never been countermand- ed! CAN BAPTISM COME IN ITS ROOM? Two dispensations, but the same Church! Circumcision the door in the first, baptism the door in {he second!! Yet circumcision has not been countermanded, and is in vogue with the Jews to this day!!! At breathless silence prevailed for a moment, but it was soon interrupted. "Now," continued Mr. Westoun "since I have proven that the old Jewish organization cannot be identical with the Christian Church, let us look for one that is. For evidently there was a Church before' Christ. We cannot think there-was a visible organization before Christ, but a mysticdal body of believers in his coming; and that body was of the Jews only. "The first promise of our Savior wa 'And I will put enmity between thee and the womain, aid between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy lead; and thou shalt bruise his heel. Here is the first reference to our Savior. This was a consolation to Adam and Eve, and to as many of their seed as accepted the promise. But in time the world forgot that there was a God. For this, He determined to destroy them from the face of the earth. te sends the flood. Only eight souls were saved. God is not left without a witness on earth however. There is one that yet believes in him, and his promise. The flood is' over. In time Noah's family became nume- rous. Wickedness again reigns. The tower of Babel is built. 'We all know its object. The, tongue of the nation is 'confounded. Their plans are thivarted. Ten genera' tions pass away, and then God visits the Gentiles, 'to take out of them a people for his name.' 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father'  house, unt o a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of' thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, anld make thy name ,great ;  and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him thal u ,!rseth thee: AD IN THEE SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTII BE BLESSED.' Here is the covenant taken from the Gentiles, and made with Abraham, The Gentiles' have no right to this promise now.   "God has visited the Gentiles and has taken him a people, in Abraham, and has given this covenant to  him, and through him, in after days the nations of the earth shall be blessed. That this is the Gospel covenant it  cannot be doubted. Paul says it is, in so many words- 'And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would (in time to i come,) justify the heathen through faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all na- tions be blessed.' "Then this is the Gospel covenant, the very identical words. Were such words used in the covenant of cir- cumcision? This is the first covenant with Abraham in which his seed first, and then the Gentiles were to look for Spiritual blessings. Can anything be more explicit? The Apostles were correct in their quotations always, and understood their meanings. "Stephen, in speaking. of the covenant of circumci- sion, only connects with it the land inheritance. Hear him. 'And Godi spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years. And the nation to whom they shall be in bon- dage, will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. And he gave him (Abraham) the covenant of circumcision: (not the' cove- nant of the GospeD and so Abraham begat Isaac, and cir- cumcised him the eighth day;- and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs. And the patriarchs moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him, And delivered him out of afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharoah king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.' Now comes the bondage. Jacob and his; family are carried into Egypt. I a short time they are made servants. 'But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, till another king arose, which knew not Joseph. The same dealt subtilely with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.' Then Moses was born. He was nourished by Pharoah's daughter. The time came when God revealed to him that he was to be instrumental in releasing his people.         c i1  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC8270-00000105"/> oyn4      X  .I  n **  He (God) brings them out of Egypt' in the fulness of time, in remembrance of his covenant of circumcision with Abraham. Does this look like the Gospel cove- nant?.  "I would ask you a question there Mr. Weston. If circumcision were the sign that the Iarealites should in- herit Canaan, why did not all inherit that land, that were circumcised?" Notwithstanding it was now impossible to retrieve Pedobaptists' grounds, Mr. Sumner was for doing Mr. Weston all the harm he could, by trying to puzzle him with knotty questions. "Circumcision was designed as a pledge to Abraham only, that his seed should inherit the land of Canaan. No generation was specified. The covenant was given to Abraham alone, and to be perpetuated through his race, as a strict obligation to remember it, and that they had an interest i it. God never'designed that all should possess the land, but that it should be -a mark, insuring deliverance from their bondage of different periods. The Jew in his exilement ever relies on that sign. To this day, he looks forward to the end of that time, which will bring on the Promise of $verlasting Possession! "N Now for a plurality of covenants; I allowed you the advantage Mr. Sumner, of one covenant, but you could not establish your position, even with that unlimited ad- vantage-so I will take the favor away, and prove what I desire, by a 'plurality of covenants.' The covenant of Spir- ,itual blessings through the Jews to the Gentiles, at the ex- piration of the Jewish dispensation,was,'The covenant con- firmed by God, concerning Christ, four hundred and thir- ty years before the law,' which if chronologically consi- dered, dates back to the seventy-fifth year of Abraham's age. That concerning circumcision, (and called by Stekphen the 'covenant of circumcision,' pertaining to land inheritance) was given in the ninety-ninth year of Abraham. -The covenant at Sinai was ratified immediate- ly after the Exodus, or rather, four hundred and thirty years after the covenant of Grace. "Now we have found the covenant of the Church, be- ginning from the time, when God said, the seed of the wo- man should bruise the serpent's head.. This promise goes on for the whole human race, until their wickednesp   '. a 1  A. IX v a p A JL u U A A L JX . lYwVU causes God to visit them, and take out a people (in Abra- ham) to serve him. No longer does he /now look com- passionately on the degenerate race, but out of theim, he selects a people, on whom lie can bestow his mercies. And now there is no antidote for the dire transgression of Adam and his consort, for from their descendants en masse, God takes the promise of that boon, and gives, it to an isolated people, whom, he chose to serve him, and on whom he mercifully bestows such rich blessings, and of whom is to spring the one who is to liquidate the debt of sin committed within the bowers of Eden. "To this people, and to this people alone, for a space of indefinite time, he gives the promise of the Saviour, and through this people's seed, the nations of the earth were to be blessed, in time to come. Prior to the coming of Christ no one, circumcised, or, uncircumcised, had any right to expect his coming-to belong to that mystical body, but those from whose flesh he should spring: or as in Isaac shall thy seed be called.' Christ was to spring up from the seed of Abraham. The Ishmealites though of that seed, were not the seed of the promise as was Isaac, so they were cast out though circumcised, which evidently goes to prove, that circumcision was no sign of spiritual blessings. Ishmeal though circumcised, was not the seed, of; which the promised Savior was to come, so he had no more right to expect, or trust in) the coming Savior than the Gentiles. Those only, had a right to look fdr his coming, who belonged to the seed through which the promise was to come. That is, Isaac. ' Can we believe that the Ishmealites, the Edmonites and the Shechemites, all belonged to the Church of God? They were circumcised No! 'In Isaac shall thy seed be called.' Let as many, like the above (and other na. tions which were circumcised) be circumcised into the old Jewish organization as they choose, but none had a right to expect a Saviour, or to be of that mystic body, but those who belonged to the seed out of which the Saviour was to come.  s "By saying this I do not mean that all of Isaac's seed were saved. No. Only those who looked for the coming of Christ in a proper manner. Paul tells that blindness in part 'happened' unto Isreal, which was prophe. sied, would be before the grafting in of the Gentiles, when /  .       -   &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC8270-00000106"/> 8206     L- EAN DER H A LL . the whole covenant was fulfilled, 'In thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.' This happened when the time came, when God fulfilled the promise of building up the tabernacle of David, which was 'fallen' in a fig- urative sense. But how? not the walls literally tumbled, but by a long space between prophecy and the coming of Christ, so only a few souls, such as Anna, the prophetess, and good old Simeon were informed as to the nature of Christ. Hence agrees the sayings: "Simon hath de- clared how God at the first; did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this will I return, and build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down;-and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, (before then none be- longed to it, but the seed of Isaac;) upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.' And, 'For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree. wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and the fatness of the olive tree: Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off; that I might be grafted in. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be hot high- minded, but fear. For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which-fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is ableto graffthemin again. For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, whichbe the natural branches, be graffed into theirown olive tree? For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits, that blitidness in part is happened to Isreal, until the fulness of the Gentiles-be come in.'--Rom. xi. 16.-25. /   THE INVESTIGATION.        ZVUT 4'Does the Church spoken of by these passages look like the old Jewish organization into which the Gentiles were circumcised at their will, and whose policy threw its arms around thousands outside of the seed of Abraham? When and where in sacred history was circumcision re- fused a Gentile who wished to come into the Jewish poli- ty? Nations were circumcised who were no more Abra- ham's seed according to the flesh, than you or I. Again I repeat, the promise of a Savior was to come from the seed of Isaac, and none but Isaac's seed prior to his (the Saviour's) coming, had a right to look for him or rely on him as their Saviour. To this agrees the Allegory: "'My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, I desire to be present with you now, and to change imy voice: for I stand in doubt of you. Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free womari. But he who was of the bond-maid was born of the flesh - but he of the free woman was, by promise. Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and Answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.' But the other covenant is the covenant of promise, it has nothing to do with the covenant from mount Sinai, which you acknow- ledge was appended to the covenant of circumcision. 'But Jerusalem which is above, is free, which is the mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that barest not, break forth and cry, thou that travailest not.: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath a husband. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the chil- dren of the promise,' (Gal. iv. 19-28,) since God hath called the Gentiles.  That Isaac was the child of promise, and of his seed should come the Messiah, no one can doubt, and that the Churc in its mystical state was confined to his seed is no less manifest. "When the Kingdom of God was at hand, when John the Baptist was preaching Christ, the seed of Isaac (who rightfullylshould have received him, but had departed from the faith,) they came with the plea of being Abra-  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC8270-00000107"/> 208       LEANDER HALL. ham's children, (of the promise no doubt,) but John tells them, that they are a generation of vipers, that they can not receive Christ without repentance' He was not come, as they thought to be a king literally over Isreal; but his was a spiritual kingdom, hence to enter it, they must be born again. 'He came unto his own, (his people accord- ing to the flesh of the promise,) and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name; Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.' (John:I. 11, 12.) Few of the Jews, at his coming under- stood his mission as being of this nature therefore, few received hinm. "Much more could be said on this subject but I pre- sume, it is unnecessary. However, if any one present is still unsatisfied, I will not leave it. What do you say Mr. Sumner? I believe you are more immediately inter- ested." "As I said before Mr. Weston, I am willing to let it go. Infant baptism cannot be proven from that source I am sure, but I do not feel the least uneasy, for I am certain the New Testament is so clear and legible on that point that, there could be no doubt entertained as to the authenticity of infant-church-membership." "Well, Mr. Sumner, if you even prove it from there, I will give .p the point. True, that is the place you ought to have gone at first, but you would not." "Had I known as much as I do now, I would. The thing has always beenmystified by spiritual blessings in the Abrahamic covenant to his seed. That is the source from which I imbibed my erroneous notions. But when we come to the New Testament, then I can vindicate the csuse, and with othodoxical assistance too." "If it were not for my honest convictions Mr. Sumner, I might second that assertion, but believing as I do, that infant baptism is an institution of men, and sprang up with other innovations of the Pope, I cannot say God speed you." "But you do not mean to say, Mr. Weston,' interrupt- ed Mr. Bacon quickly, "that infant baptism has neither precept nor example in the New Testament, do you " "I do sir: and can prove it."   THE INVBgt fAfATIO.       209 - You are jesting, Mr. Weston! You have lost sight of the thing entirely. You certainly never read the Sew Testament through! You are not in earnest, are you?" "I am sir," was the firm reply. "Mr. Weston," said Annie, after her father had ceased speaking, " do you really think what yon say? Can it be possible that any one who has 'read the New Testament through, can think that infant baptism was not prac- ticed by the Apostles?" "Yes, Miss Annie, it is possible, and probable. I can show you that there is neither precept nor example in the New Testament for infant baptism." "Well I always thought it useless, Mr. Weston, but thought, and think yet it was a command, or practiced by the Apostles, that is sufficient reason for its perpetua- tion." "It would be, indeed, Miss Annie, if such were the case, but on the contrary, it was neither commanded nor practiced." "Well, do you believe that Christians could do it if there were neither precept, nor example in the Bible for it? Is  it possible that you think any one who loves Christ would - ddare add such a supererogation?" "That question con only be answered by the termina- tion of further discussion on this point. If I can prove that it is an institution of men, then you will see what Christians have presumed on the Church of God. I will not say that they have done this without Bible testimony accompanying me." "Which I feel confident, sir, you will not have, for I firmly believe that it was practiced in the Apostolic age. At least it is a concession by all great men." N"Not at all Miss Annie. By all Pedobaptist you should have said; and not by all of them either." "Well, have it any way you please, I think some of them would have found out the error, I mean some one of the great Peodobaptist men. For instance, Adam Clark, the great expounder of the Scriptures; he cer- tainly would not have written such a commentary and not found out the error had there been any; having ex- amined every verse in the Bible, and written on each one, I can't see how it is possible for him to have overlooked such an error, had there been any.

I hope Miss Bacno, you won't consider yourself so' well fortified by having 'great men' on your side, that you will not be open to conviction." "Oh no sir, I'll take Bible evidence any time against the opinions of every great man in the world. Am I not justifiable in doing this?"  Certainly, certainly Miss Annie. I cannot suppose that any one would deny you that right, or dissuade you from such a commendable course." "Then don't experience any uneasiness, Mr. Weston, on my account. I will not fail to see and appreciate all the argument you may adduce. I feel confident that I am right and you are wrong," she added smilingly -Mr. Sumner listened to the above conversation with marked attention. Somehow he did not exactly like the tenor of Annie's answers, but reassured himself by re- verting to Mr. Taylor's discription of her perfect subju- gation. And then, she was on his side, that was certain, for,;she had averred several times her strong belief in 'the orthodoxy of infant baptism. His task now was to sustain his position, and she would be saved. Poor man! little did he know how averse were her feelings to such enslavement of prejudices and of fear, subsidiary to the formation of unwarranted principles. Mr. Sumner was -entirely ignorant of the true state of Annie's mind. He had buildedhis castle of hope, on Mr. Taylor's version. But on his own knowledge soon would the superstructure be torn down in the twinkling of an eye; and the rearei left to contemplate its ruin without hope. But let us. not anticipate. As it was near twelve, the party concluded to break up, so in a few moments they were interspersed over the town, each man to his avocation, all but Mr. Sumner, who staid in order to have a conversation with Annie, to -be-reassured in his hope. 'They were seated in the parlor looking through a large -bay-window, out on the ruffled bed of the Ohio, as she -whirled; her waters over her bosom on to their destination. Water is still when on a level, but otherwise it is the :raustiest ress of all inanimate creation, a striking type of :the' spirit of man.   THE INVESTI GATtNO.      2" Annie was gazing on the scene before her vacantly. Mr. Sumner had been turning the leaves of a book, try- ing to think all the while of some easy way of intro- ducing the subject that laid so heavily on his mind. Once or twice he essayed to introduce it, but some objection to the plan would rise up and deter him until hesitation be- gan, so the effort was lost altogether. He was not without his foreboding, or why was he so reluctant to broach the theme surfeited by so much in- apposite sustenance? He could but know that it would have no pleasant sound on Annie's ear, let it be clothed in greatest suavity. He sat listening to the palpitations of his heart, set in motion by dread, and wondered if Annie could not hear its beating too. He cast a look at her face, seeking in vain an index to her feelings, but there was nothing stamped there. It was blank. Annie was listless, and wrapt in such thought of other things that she did not note his agitations and restlessness He got up and began to pace the floor. His thoughts , kept time with the regular soundings of his feet. After being engaged in this occupation until he found that things were growing no better as to courage, he stopped abruptly before her! She looked up in surprise. "Annie I must speak now!" were the first words he uttered. "Speak what Mr. Sumner?"' she asked, not compre- hending his peculiar emotions. "I wish to tell you how glad-yet I don't know whether I am right or not, I have had no"- Here he stoppedl short. "What do you mean Mr. Sumner? What in the world is it that excites you so?" she asked in her bewil- derment. "Am I excited?" he asked in- as calm a voice as he could command. "Yes very much, or your looks deceive your feelings. But what is it that you wish to tell me? Is it anything that I have done?" "Nothing dreadful Annie, I assure you. You cannot imagine my delight when Bro. Taylor returned last Sat- urday night with such glorious news." 1     } . .                 .--  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC8270-00000109"/> ,212      LEAD'ER HALL. "What glorious news?" she asked eagerly, forgetting the circumstance. "Is it possible that you have forgotten? I have not,  I give my;word for-it. Oh when he told me that you saw things in their proper light"- "Oh Mi..Sumner!" "You do not half know Annie," he continued, not giv- ing hier time to finish her sentence, "how happy Ifelt that night." "Mr. Sumner do listen "- Oh no, Annie, no apology is necessary. Don't men- tion the past. I can forget it easily and readily. Persons will fall into such??errors occasionally. Now that it is all over with, I feel twice as happy as I did before. Perhaps it makes me iappreciate you the more." "But Mr. Sumner "- "No, no, Annie, I tell you not to mention. it. Let it be forgotten. I know you are penitent and that is suffi- cient remuneration for the past." "You must hear me Mr.2-- "I tell you Annie, you shall not trouble yourself with it any longer. I want to talkl about something else. I don't care a straw now, since you have become recon- ciled."  "Oh Mr. Sumner, you are so"- "Not at all Annie. It is everybody's duty to forgive when asked. You must think I have a hard heart if you think I' am going to let you plead mercy here in tears, for no greater crime than the one you have com- mitted. I say let the subject alone. Here comes your father so let us talk about something else. Come in Mr. Bacon, come near the window here, we h ave such al'fine view of the river!" Thus Mr. Sumner rattled on, not giving Annie a chanlce to undeceive him, in spite of her efforts; he, mistaking her object, thinking it was to ask pardon, when it was to reveal to him a, melancholy fact, one that would have stamped gloom on thje bright hdrizon of his future.  Tears-large diamond drops had gathered in her eyes. To hide her emotion, she excused herself from the room immediately, and sought her own sanctuary, there to pour out this flood of 'grief in silence that hadl issued from the recent stirring of the fount of her heart.   THE INVESTIGA TION.        Z1a Mr. Sumner and Mr. Bacon chatted away the evening very pleasantly, neither knowing the true state of-things, yet, "If ignorance is bliss, then it is folly to be wise." I            "  CHAPTER XVIII. i     ,.THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED INFANT BAPTISM NOT TAUGHT IN THE BIBLE, BECAUSE THE COM- MSSION READS: Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that BEIEVETH and is baptized shal be saved." Matt. xvi: 15,16. Mr. BACO and Mr. Sumner rejoiced in the hope of vic- tory in the coming theological division. Both had read I   commentaries more than the Bible, so they had thorough- ly imbibed the commentator's notions, who always hap- pened to be Pedobaptists. Mr. Sumner was as happy that morning as he could ask, now that Annie was settled, and the task before them was so easy. He did not anticipate anything but perfect success. He was well fortified with incontrovertible ar- gument, for previous to leaving home he had made out a. flattering palladium of his day's travels, with every point (ashe thought,) well authenticated. So they were, by Pedobaptist versions.

Mrs. Jones' savory coffee and " delightful rolls" were unceremoniously despatched, the only compliment given was the readiness of participation, and apparent satisfaction of the countenance as the esculencies were r  undergoing a rapid mastication. A thought suggests itself. Were the scriptures with their obstinate teach- ings as easily to be disposed of as Mrs. Jones' edibles, Mr. Sumner Would have no difficulty in clearing the whole Bible of anti-Pedobaptistical doctrine. But there are blocks in the way, which cannot be moved only by a command from Heaven. Breakfast over, a book under his arm, Mr. Sumner sallied from his domicile to meet the fortunes of the day. He had barricaded all doubt or foreboding from his mind, by the impregnable fortress of Hope--with her guilded walls impervious to evil anticipations. Yet who can read the future?  Who can turn the leaves of " what is:to be," and trace the developments of time in all her curious freaks? Were it possible for an individual to do this perhaps more sadness of the present would befelt. It is best as it is, though as the pen glides atong these lines it can but touch in imagination of what may be. Oh could the whole secret: be revealed to Mr. Sumner, what changes the revelation would make! But we must desist, as, "Anticipation is the potion of present joys." Mr. Bacon and Mr. Sumner were in caucus when the other constituents of the party arrived. Mr. Bacon was a great deal more affable than he had been for some time. It looked like he was exerting himself to make the con- vocation more pleasant than before. The extent of the influence of interest, few can tell. We have seen it bpe- rating like a charm, when true principle was as far dis- tant as the east is from the west. But to the subject. When the assembly was complete, Mr. Sumner took a pencil and marked a place in the New Testament over Clark's Commentaries.- Then he laid that book aside and began a rapid search for something in another. This lasted only a few moments, during which there was no interruption made. At last his purpose seemed to have Ieen accomplished, and he looked up as much as to say;   '?t      THE INVES TIr    TION.215 "I am ready." But feeling that it devolved on him to introduce the subject, he cleared his throat and gave his chair a slight hitch and began: "Ahem. Gentlemen you all know what grounds my opponent has taken on this point. He said yesterday il your presence that there was neither precept, nor exam- ple in the New Testament for infant Church membership. Well, 1 think this is saying much upon such a hazard. Certainly, Mr. Weston; you could not have been positive in such a declaration when the whole New Testament abounds with examples of infant baptism?" "I was certainly in earnest Mr. Sumner.. If you will show me one command to baptize infants, or one that chuld be so construed with the proper elipsis, I am cer- tainly willing to give up this point, as'far as my individ- :  .ual self is concerned. I do not dispute this division for controversy sake, but because I am honestly convicted. If I did not believe this, I would not teach it for the world-I would not presume on Christ's Church, to prop- agate any doctrine that is not inculcated in the Scripture ^ I would feel like I was robbing Christ of his. authority, by the changing of his commands. Could I ever look for the 'Blessed are they that do his commandments,' as being applied to me? With this Great Monitor (the Bi- ble,) before me, sounding in my ears its teachings, and commands, and all positive too, can you suppose thatI or any one who professes to. be a Christian, would willfully contend for a principle not taught therein, because it is a creed of a Church? Why sir, were I to be convinced to-day that infant baptism was taught or practiced in the apostolic age, I would leave the Baptist Church before to-morrow morning! What, stay with a sect that dares to set aside any of the precepts of this precious book? I'd sooner have my head cut off' than live on earth to pervert Christ's Church!" " I Mr. Weston spoke with some feeling. Oh! that every one could see like he did  If the Bible only and not tra- ditivoal creeds, werethe guide to lovers of Christ, dissen- tion and strife could find no existence. How much is closed between its sacred lids that is rejected!--shut out from men's hearts and practices! And why? -  Ask the j  eqcho of history with his bloody vissage!

' But to return. Mr. Weston's reply had elicited much attention. If any were doubtful of his honesty previously, they would have felt ashamed afterwards to have expressed it. Mr. Sumner was a little surprised to hear such deter- minate sentiments. Somehow he could not feel so com- fortably afterwards. But he continued: "I am afraid Mr. Westofh, you are too determined in your feelings to be liberal in this discussion. .Ihope, however, that my proof may be so irresistible, that such sentiments may be supplanted immediately." "Only produce your proof Mr. Sumner, and I promise to be an attentive listener." 4 Well now, the first incontestible evidence that I will bring forward is the grand eomnissidn itself. This is one of our strongest arguments in favor of infant baptism. Indeed, no one would dare set it aside." "Read it Mr. Sumner; I have never been, able to see anything in it that would justify infant baptism, or could possibly be construed in its favor. Read it, perhaps I have overlooked the main point. Read and explain its significance on this division." "So 1 will. 'Go ye therefore' and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Fath-er, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you :' &amp;c. 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believ,eth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.' This is the whole of the commission from the two Evangelists." "And what is in it to warrant infant baptism? It   roads: ' He that BELIEVETH and is baptized shall be saved:' Can infants believe? "But sir, by that you teach the doctrine of damnation to infants! You say: 'He thathelieveth and is baptized shall be saved,' of course it follows, according to your theory, that he that does not believe, let him be an infant or what, and is not baptized, shall be damned- - Now sir, that is your own doctrine.' If you place. such a lim- ited construction on the commission, you exclude infants from Heaven, for you virtually say, 'he that does not be- lieve (infants and all,) shall be damned.'  "You are nistaken, Mr. Sumner. That is not a fair grammatical reading at all. Now let me read it and sup- ply the proper elipsis. 'Preach the gospel to every creature. He that hears the gospel, believes the gospel, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that hears the gospel andtdisbelieves the gospel, and is not consequent- ly baptized shall be condemned ' That is the true read- \ ing; therefore, the Bible threatens damnation in the com- mission, to those who hear the gospel, disbelieve and re- ject it. This a true exegetical exposition. Infants who are not capable of ecaring at all with any. understanding, the commission does not reach or include them on any construction. Now no one can deny or dispute that matheteusate in the first part of the commission, means to make disciples. How do you make disciples? By teach, ing them-converting them. Can infants at the mother's breast be taught? No what is a disciple? Hear what Christ said. . 'If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and sister, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my, dis- ciple.' Can infants do this? 'And whosoeer doth not bear his'cross and .come after me cannot be my disciple. So likewise, whosoever he be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath hv cannot be my disciple.' Is it possible, for infants to be made such? Are infants capable of any such a duty? and is it ever expected of them? Would any body but great men think of such an absurd thing? You VIr. Sumne', do not nretend to baptize intfints on these grounds." "So, of churse not, we baptize them on the faith of their parents, like Abraham's children were circumcised." ' "His Fservtnt 9w ere ;rre I Meised too on his faith Yon    19  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC8270-00000112"/> 218       LEANYDER HALL. do not carry out the theory., But show me something in this commission that favors infant baptism?" "Itis this Mr. Weston: 'Baptize all nations.' Are not children included? Was there ever a nation in which there were no children? The command is so clear that everybody who does not bear a prejudiced heart catn see it. Baptize the nations. The command is not limited." "I hope you will not try to urge any objection to that, Mr. Weston, it is so plain,"interrupted Mr. Bacon, some- what satisfied with the young minister's last effort. "Yes sir, I do urge objections to that. If Christ meant for 'all nations' to include every member of those na- tions, there musthave been children of unbelievers bap- tized as well as of believing parents! It meant that they were to go to all nations, (not to the Jews only, as it had formerly been done,) and teach them, and as many as did believe and were baptized, should be saved. Do you be- lieve that God meant for all the infidels, idolators, prof- ligates and murderers with the infant children of unbe- lievers, all to be baptized into his Church?" "No we: don't contend for any but children of be- lievers." "Then where is your ground for their baptism in the commission? Mr Sumner was puzzled. He did not know what to say for several minutes. When he found that silence was only becoming more embarrassing, he rallied him- self. "If infant baptism is not taught in the commission, it is in other places, so we can just cite other instances to corroborate it. Christ rebuked his Apostles for forbid- ding little children to come to him, 'for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.' Now by the kingdom of Heaven is meant his church. This Church is composed of disci-  ples, then children in their purity and innocence, are like disciples, so even in, the commission they can claim baptism*."-   ,. *.  "But Christ commanded baptism to only such as were made disciples, and not disciples by nature. The gospel was to be preached to those capable of hearing and be. lieving. As infants are incapable of instruction, or inca- pable of having faith, then they were not included in this commission; nor the last passage just cited either.'   -  -   THE  INVESTIGATION.      2 1 Well we can give up the commission and then pro our position, there are so many other proofs." "Bring up some proof Bro. Sumner that cannot disputed," said. Mr. Bacon, becoming a little uneaf He had begun to apprehend'the case would turn out li the others preceding. A change was gently coming ov the spirit of his dreams. "But I will not give up the saying of Christ, ' Suf little children,' &amp;c. He tells that the kingdom of Heave (His Church,) is composed 'of such.' Now you will a mit that all who belonged to His Church were commandi to be baptized, then if children are of the kingdom,  Heaven, (the Church,) they must have beer. baptizi too." "Yes, Bro. Sumner, they must. Who can overloc that fact? Christ said it himself, and we have no right- i     change it! He virtually said: 'Sufler little children come unto me, for my church is composed of them, wl not let them come to me? they are in my Church. A I not the head of the Church?' This evidence M Xi    Weston, I think is clear and conclusive. I venture  say it is incontrovertable." 1t   "It is strange Mr. Bacon, how people will constrt passages of Scripture to suit their doctrine." "But there is no other construction to be placed on the tam} , It is as clear in its meaning as noon-day. It explains itsel j,   You can make nothing else of it. You know yc t   cannot."        ; t!  Mr. Bacon assumed great emphasis, hoping thereby I allure Mr. Weston from a reply, butnot so. I would ask you a question, Mr. Bacon. Suppoi yon had a family of small children, all docile and. , gentle as lambs, and innocent as doves. Suppose some or I  brings you a pair of captive doves but your friends rebuk      him for bringing such trouble on your hands. You i aI .  your compassion look around at your family of childre X ,   which remind you forcibly of the two little captiv jE   [5which standobefore you, and exclaim: 'Suffer them to I brought to me, I will give them succor, for of such is m Ia  ffamily ' Would any one suppose that you meant by th that your family was composed literally of doves?" "Oh no; but what has that to do with this case?" ! H     "It is an illustration of it. Christ had oft repeatei  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC8270-00000113"/> /=TiV,     .J ajpe A nJ Ji L U I j Jl  Jj . that unless persons became as little children-humble and submissive-they 'could not enter his kingdom. He com- pares the children of his kingdom to infants, like you would your family to doves; so when the real infants were brought,to him, and his Apostles seeing that they were not proper subjects, and thinking it a useless trou- ble, demurred- with the parents, as your friend did with the person who brought the doves. But the infants now remind him of what he had said about his kingdom- that it was composed of the innocents, such as docile, sub- missive, and gentle children. So he exclaimed: 'Suffer little children to come unto me, for of such is the king- dom of heaven. Not composed literally of little chil- dren, or there would not have been any use for adult re- pentance, but 'of such'-like dnlto little children, in their manners. And then what is there said about baptism in this passage? Not a word. You must prove, Mr. Sum- ner, that it was there, or we can not take the passage as any proof at all. We must take nothing for granted." "Yet, Mr. Weston, the inference is irresistible." Indeed I cannot see why. If they had been baptized, it certainly would have been mentioned. The Apostles did not do it, for they are represented as being opposed to the children coming; :We are told that Christ never baptized, himself. Neither is it said that they were brought to be baptized, but that Christ should lay his hands on them, and bless them, and pray for them. Whatever was donefor them, was done by Christ. As he never baptized any, we must conclude that he did not baptize, but only 'laid his hands on them, and departed,' Here it suggests anidea. -If the Apostles had been in the habit of baptiz- ing infants, they would not have forbidden them to be- brought to Christ; but as they had never received any in - the kingdom, and as Christ'came to call the wicked to re- pentance, and not the righteous, they thought it useless that his time should be taken up with little children, when the Gospel did not reach them." "Well, you will have it your way anyhpw^ so it is no use to dispute on- that' any longer. We can prove our position without that passage," said Mr. Sumner reproach- fully.  "Then you relinquish it?" "Yes, you may have it for what it is'worth. Wo must   T H I V Tij D u A L v A . -- - not fool away our time on such minor points. I will you other evidences which are not so easily set aside. "Do, Bro. Sumner! Bring up something that will I tie the point at once-something that has a direct be Ii ng on infant baptism," pleaded Mr. Bacon, clespondent Mr. Sumner glanced at a little paper he held betw4 his finger and thumb,-and then turned to Acts ii: 38, He moved his chair nearer the table, so that the be might rest on it. And then he cast a furtive look at i nie, but her countenance betokened nothing unusual, he was assured, and proceeded. " "' Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be bapti every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the H Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and your childd and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord God shall call.'" "But what is in that. to prove that infants were b tized?" asked Mr. Weston, provokingly. "( Why, is it possible that you cannot see it?" "Indeed I cannot sir. Will you please point it oul "It seems to me it is plain enough for any one to ' who is not blinded by prejudices. Peter here tells th that' every one' of them must be baptized." -    " e  "But that is not saying infants must be baptized, is j2+   Mr. Sumner was so vexed with the " cool impudence' I  l*  his opponent, that he resolved once to throw down book, and have no more to do with it, but just then ' '  esaw Annie contemplating him with such attention, 1 i     he suddenly became conscious of his responsibility, :   continued: I       ("I am surprised, Mr. Weston, that you cannot see point.

I hopehe won't try to turn that to his advantage. But this is the way with the Baptists, they are greedy and selfish In their notions, not willing that any other denomination shall have a single passage of the Scriptures but them,. selves. Every body must see like they do, or they are not right. As for my part, I am willing that every man shall worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience." ' Mr. Bacon had changed then, since the first of the in- vestigation. No wonder. I presume Mr. Weston, you will let this pass on as ;  ncontegtible proof, as you keep silent. Well, I am glad of that, I hope by the time we are through you will be thoroughly convinced." "You mistake my silence, sir. I was only giving the beautiful arrangement time for effect. No doubt but Dr. Boon here acquiesces, the plan is fixed up, seemingly so plausibly."  "You do not mean to insinute, sir, that it has no foun- dation, do you?" asked Mr. Sumner, excitedly, and rising from his chair. "I do not only insinuate, but affirm-- " "'Mere affirmations are nothing,"-was the hurried in- terruption. "No, without proof, they are not. I would ask you here a question. Was the ' promise,' here spoken ofthe Holy Ghost, or baptism?', "Holy Ghost. Why, did you suppose that I was so ignorant as to think it was baptism?  Pardon me. I cannot say it was ignorance, or a wil- ful misapplication, but you certainly spoke of the promise to the children as being baptism. Perhaps you lost sight of that fact in your eagerness to establish infant, baptism. Now, that you have admitted that the promise was thle -Holy Ghost, I would ask you what was the requisition made, before that promise was insured?" "Repentance, and baptism of course." "Well, since you have admitted that much, point to an instance where infants have believed been baptized, and   THE INVESTIGATION.        22: have received the Holy Ghost, or the argument is wort] no more to you than the instance of the eunuch's bap tism." "You know that I cannot do it, sir, nor do we teacl that they do. Infants here are to be baptized on the faitl of their parents." "But it expressly says, Repent, and be baptized, befor: e    they can expect the Holy Ghost. Can infants repent?' "It did not say that infants were to repent, but the promise to them through the parents." "Strange idea, that! -Where, in the record of history, as concerning this, have infants received the Holy Ghost? It did not mean that the promise spoken of, was baptism as you have admitted, but that it was the Holy Ghost, so even according to your own theory, infants were not bap- tized, for it was not baptism that was promised. Nor was baptism commanded for the children. To carry out this figure, the Apostle tells them, this is something good that has come, that they had a share in it if they would repent, and even their children and their children's chil- dren who were to come after them, if they would repent, yea, 'to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.' "Now, the term children cannot be applied to infants as I have clearly proven, since they cannot repent, nor have any, as we have record of, ever received the Holy Ghost. It could only mean their descendants. In the next chapter Peter says to the same people who were all grown up men and women: Ye are the children of the pro- phets.' Nothing is more common than to speak of the Jews as the children of Israel: must we mean by this that they are babies?-a baby nation? "Even granting that they were infants, what does that prove for you? Nothing, but much against you, for to take the promise as being baptism instead of the Holy Ghost, then those that were afar off, proselytes, idolators, thie*s, robbers, and every class of men were all to be baptized whether grown up, or small, whether children of believing parents, or of infidels, they must all be baptized, to carry- out your theory, and then receive the Holy Ghost."    ,' But we do not think that," he persisted. "Oh no.

The wlhole chapter is a repudiation of infant baptism." "How can you make that, Mr. Weston? I don't think I ever heard such an assumption." "It is not an assumption at all, Mr. Sumner. I have proven that the verses which you have just cited, are an- tagonistic to your theory; and afterwards it goes on to say 'Then they that gladly received his word (could infants re- ceive his word?) were baptized: (atnd only those that receiv- ed his word,) and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued steadfastly 'm the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.' Calld infalts have done this? ' And all that believed (itfants.! were together,' &amp;c. Now a very striking inference (your logic) comes up here. If 'there had been infants baptized it would have been men- tioned. Thatsome infants were present we must con- clude, or that there were many families without any chil- dren if married, or else Ill old maids and bachelors. The chapter goes on further in its repudiation of infant bap- tism, butIwontnotice it here, as we have no time to lose. What have you made of this isolated reference, which, if I mistake not, is one of your strongest proofs of infant baptism? Do you still count. on it as infallible?" "I acknowledge, Mr. Weston, that it will not do to risk infant baptism on that passage, nor isjt necessary, since there is so much more evidence 'ahead. Such instances as I have brought up mtay- be considered as indirect in- stances, which lead us to believe that it was practiced, but the whole new Testament is full of examples, precepts, and references, which are almost incalculable in their weight." "Then bring up one instance, or only one example, of its practice. Or just one reference that can possibly be so construed, aud I will surrender my position." "Paul makes a reference to it that, cannot be repudia- ted; the Acts abounds with its practice." "Please mention the reference that Paul makes to it. I do not remember of ever reading anything fronl him on that subject, directly, or indirectly."

I don't think there iA a word said about baptism in it, or even the slightest reference." "You don't understand it, Mr. Weston." "I understand that I can see nothing about infant bap-  tism. Perhaps you can explain it to me. Please try. "It means that if the parent is holy, the children are holy, and also fit subjects for baptism. It is an infallible proof thatchildren should be baptized on the faith of their parents."  "I cannot concur withyou, Mr. Sumner. I think you have iisconstrued the passage in otot. There is nothing in it to justify your conclusion. The word sanctify and holy are used by the Jews in a physical, or mnoral sense. A man was said to be sanctified or cleansed, or holy, when cleansed of the leper which was a physical disease. Nor does any one believe that the Apostle meant that the 4 children of believers were to be saved -on the faith of teir parents? Did David's faith save Absalom? Do you suppose Mr. Bacon's faith here could save his daughter, even if she were an infant? N3o, you do not think that, hece ' now are they (children) holy,' callot be taken in a moral sense at all. Dr. McKJiight, one of your best commentators, and one who never forgot to speak in favor of infant baptism, gives a better elucida- tiou of this than I can. .Allow me to read from himl: "'I think, therefore, with Elsner, that the words in this verse have neither a federal nor a moral meaning, :i  but are used in .the idiom of the Hebrew s, who-by sancti- fled understood what was fitted for a particular use, and by unchawn what was unfit for use, and therefore was- to be cast away. In that sense the Apostle, speaking of meat, says, I Tim. 4: 5. It is sanclitfied (that is fitted for your use,) by the wordd of God and praye Vr. 4. .very creature' of God (fit for God) is good, and nothing fit for food is to be' east way as unclean.

LEAN DE   HALL. married to them; because their affections to the Christian larty will insure to that party the faithful performance of every duty; and that if the marriages of Christians and infidels were dissolved, they would cast away their children as unclean-that is, by losing their affection for them, they would expose them after the barbarous custom of the Greeks, or at least neglect their education; but by continuing their marriages, their children are holy, they are preserved as sacred pledges of their mutual love, 1and educated with care. - "I think the proper idea is set forth clearly. Dr. Mc- Knight though a member of the Presbyterian Church, and one of its most learned men; left not a stone unturned in aiding infant baptism. You have heard hisYversion, now let me read how he paraphrases the text: 'For the infi- del husband is sanctified--is fit:ed to remain married to the believing wife by his affection for her; and the infidel wife is sanctified to the believing husband by her affec- tion for him; othewise certainly your children would be by you neglected 'as unclean, whereas indeed they are clean, they are the objects of your affections and care."' "If. Dr. McKnight has said that, remember sir, that we are proving things by the Bible and not Doctors of Di- vinity. I say the idea is clearly set forthl, if parents are sanctified then their children are clean."  "Well, sir, granting that for argument, then if children are clean so must be the infidel husband or wife, and ac- cording to your theory, they must be baptized too!! Do you do this? Paul says the unbelieving husband is sanc- tified by the wife, he must be baptized and even saved, on her faith!" Mr. Sumner could make no reply to this. Mr. Bacon. saw his embarrassment and aimed assistance, in his way. "But w've do not baptize the wife or husband on the faith of each other. Who ever heard of such a thing? We only baptize children." "I know you do not, sir, yet, if you take the privilege, to do that from that text, you should, to carry out its meaning. (your constructior) baptize the infidel bus- band or wife either', as the case nmay be, for they are as mtuch sanctified as the children. You see, Mr. Bacon, if- you tak, this passage to prove the authenticity of infant (baptism, it will prove too much, so I advise you to let it elide." ,   THE INVESTIGATION.        .227 "We can do that and then prove our position, for we  have many instances of the practice of infant baptism in the Acts which we have not touched on yet," said Mr. Sumner, rather dryly. "' All you have to do, Mr. Sumner, is to cite them." "And you will set them all aside just to suit your fancy," interrupted Mr. Baconl in a crusty tone. "You do me an in justice by saying that, Mr. Bacon. Indeed, I would shrink from such an act as quickly as I wouldfrom murder. I can conceive of no difference in the magnitude of the two sins, unless the former exceeds the latter. One would be taking a great load of sin on his shoulders to attempt such a task. I leave it to Mr. Semms here, one of your strongest Methodists; if I have dealt unfairly to-day in vindicating my cause which I conceive to be collateral with Christ's. Say, Mr. Semms, do you think I have taken too much latitude?" "I think Mr. Weston you have sustained yourself very well, and without presuming on the Scriptures either. I think Bro. Sumner you certainly have overlooked the mair grounds for infant baptism,or there are none at all." I'm saving them, Bro. Semms, for the last.' "-But did you not admit," said Mr. Weston, " that those just cited were considered the strongest proofs?" I must acknowledge, 1 had been accustomed to think so, but since closer reflection, we have others yet more conclusive." "If we have not, Bro. Sumner, I must say, it is a des- 'perate case," remarked Mr. Semms. "You yield too easily, Bro. Semms. We cannot count on Mr. Weston's theories as being entirely orthodox." "But if he shows that we have no room for infant baptism, then we must give it up. Of course in the event of such a thing, we would have to consider it a human creed of supererogation, and abandon it." "He has not proved that yet." "And I sincerely hope he may not. However, don't let us bandy words here on probabilities or possibilities, but proceed, Bro. Sumner, with the investigation, for I am very anxious for its termination.' Mr. Bacon was provoked with Mr.. Semms. He hear- tily wished he had staid at home. "I will first cite you, Mr. Weston, to Corneliaus ad  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC8270-00000117"/> 228       LEANDER HALL. his household, I know there has been some doubt - pressed as to this passage aiding- us, even by our o men, but it looks to me like there must have been so infants in that family. I won't say positively that th were, but it seems very likely." "And yet it reads: 'While Peter yet spake th words, the Holy Ghost fell on allthem which heard 1 word.' And also 'Peter commanded them that had ceived the Holy Ghost to be baptized' (none other There might have been infants, for aught I know, b none were commanded to be baptized but those who h received the Holy Ghost! And those that received t Holy Ghost spoke with tontgues and magnified God. TI * instance does nothing for you, Mr. SSumner,you had b( ter go on to some other that will help you, unless you cl find where infants have received the Holy Ghost!" "Oh well, I did not rely on that. I only said I thoug it was an instance in which infants might have been bal tized, but asyou say, it seems that Peter commanded thol to be baptized who had to use his language, 'received ti Holy Ghost as well as we."' "So you will relinquish that passage, Mr. Sumner?" "Yes sir. It can do me no good. But there-is Lydi and her household, which has always been considered a example of infant baptism." "Why so, Mr. Sumner. There was no mention of it fants in that case, was there?" "No, but the inevitable conclusion is, that there were One thing is certain, if infants or adults, they were al baptized on her faith, for she is the only one mentioncs whose heart was opened. There is nothing said abou their hearing or believing either. Let me read it. 'And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira. which worshipped God, heard us:. whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the thing which were spoken of Paul. And when she was bap tized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there.' Now if her household had been adults there would have been something said about their believing or hearing, so whoever were baptized they must have been infants. This I consider the strongest proof in the New Testament Scriptures'for infant baptism.'   T BHB INVESTIGATION.        229 "And yet, sir, you will acknowledge that there is not a single word said about infants. If this is a sample, I : consider your case hopeless. You were to prove that in- fant baptism was practiced, but you are only citing pro- bable cases. You can't prove that Lydia was married; if married you cannot prove that she had any children. G Grown persons might have been baptized and nothing said about their faith, for the Evangelist knew that it was always considered, whether mentioned or not. Paul speaks of baptizing the household of Stephanus, yet says nothing about their having faith. It was not a necessity that their hearing or believing should be mentioned." "And yet you cannot prove that there were not infants there." "Nor is it my place. You must prove that there were, oryour position is not sustained. The term household might have meant only the responsibles, or nearly all of the family. It is said that Ellanah and his house went up to Shiloh to offer-unto the Lord the yearly sacri- fice, and yet we learn from what follows, that Hannah, l and the young Samnel staid at home. So it might have g been with Lydia's household. You must show Mr. Sum- 1 ner that infants were in her house, or you have not proven h that infants were baptized."  I: "I know I cannot prove that there were, but you can ! not prove that her household was composed of adults." (7 "But I can." And where on earth would you get them from? I am : certain there is not a word said about them here!" he ? exclaimed, running his eyes down the pages of the open  book which he held in his hand. "If you will read the last verse in the chapter you will see that those of Lydia's house were brethren." Mr. Sumner glanced over the chapter until he came to the last verse. Yes, there it was! He had never seen it before! "Please read, Mr. Sumner, as you have the book." "' (And they went out of the prison, and entered into  the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed.' "How do you know, Mr. Weston, but that these were other converts which they had made?" "Lydia is the first convert mentioned, and then her  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8270-00000118"/> 280:      L ANDTB  HALL. household. -Immediately after that, the Apostles wer, cast into prison. Then the jailor is converted, and his fam ily. The next morning the Apostles are released fron prison; they leave prison and go immediately to Lydia' house to see the- brethren there. Then her house must have been composed of men, grown as they were termec brethren. Whether they were her natural brothers, uncles or what, I cannot tell, only I know they were not infants and furthermore, they were all the converts at Phillipp at that time except the jailor's family. They could not have been the jailor's family, for they (the Apostles) went to Lydia's house to see them; they had left the prison. It appears that they were in a hurry to leave the place, as they only tarried long enough to comfort the brethren, and as the magistrates had besought them to leave. Now, Mr Sumner, what is there in this instance to prove that in- fants were baptized?" "The cause is not dependent on that entirely, Mr. Wes- ton. There are others yet more conclusive." "But, tell me, do you give this up? If not, you must find more evidence, or 'Lydia and her household' is for- ever wrested from you, with all its tendencies to corrupt the Church." "Oh yes I can easily dispense with that, and then au- thenticate our loved principle." "Well do, Mr. Sumner, cite just one instance which can be relied on." "There is the jailor's house. I consider that substan- ciating, and to be relied on." s"Read the circumstance., You will find it in the same chapter, and I predict will prove fatal to your cause." "'And theyspake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized-, he and all his, straightway." Now it is not probable that a man of the discription of the jailor, ap- parently young and stout, to have a family without in- fants in it." "But you know it expressly, says, the word of God was preached to'all that were in his house. Now it strikes me, it would have been useless to have preached to infants. Also it says the jailor believed in 'the Lord with all his house.-. If there were infants there, I suppose they be- lieved too, don't you, Mr. Sumner?"   THE  INVESTIGATION.      2a. ", You know no one thinks that infants can believe," he replied petulently.  "And yet you sayinfants were there. W   are told they all believed, then if infants were there, they must have believed too with the house." ' "I said it was very probable that infants were there."   "But is that proving infant baptism? I have proven i  that there were not, or they were extraordinary infants, that could exercise faith. Such an instance certainly would have been nientioned. But this is apocryphal. You must give up that passage, Mr. Sumner, and go on to some other."  "Mr. Sumner looked very grum, and impatiently said: "And you would have me to give them all up just to suit your plan." "Not at all, Mr. Sumner. If you can make anything out of the jailor's family but persons old enough to hear and believe, you have the privilege of continuing your efforts as long as you please. Now take your time and construe that proof-text if you can to suit your cause. Remember you must find infants in it, or it is no proof at all." "You know as well as I do that there is nothing said about infants expressly " "Nor, I would suggest, indirectly, as they heard the word and believed." "Oh well, we won't quarrel about that one text. I can afford to let it go." "Before you do, I would ask you one question. Do you really believe that any infants were, baptized in that family." "I--don't know-that is, I cannot positively say that  there were, as they all believed." But, Bro. Sumner," interrupted Mr. Semms, "I re- member of hearing you, about six months ago, bringing up that very instance as incontestible proof of infant bap- tism. Surely you are overlooking some important point in it. Read it over again before you pass it by." Mr. Sumner obeyed, but he could find nothing to start on afresh, sol-he closed the book slowly, and with an un- comfortable air. The basis of infant baptism was sliding from under his feet. Mr. Sumner saw it. He remembered Annie, but  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8270-00000119"/> -.    282^      LEAnSDr   HALL. ap8dared not think what effect it mighthave on her. Ther was yet another very slight hope, eh must cling to that. "We must proceed; our time is already getting short Make your next reference'" said Mr. Weston. "I believe the next is the instance of Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue. But stop---I reckon I am-miS taken. Let me read it: 'And Crispus, the chief ruler oi the synogogue, believed on the Lord, with all his house. And many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized. This will not do. We will pass this by, as it reads that they all believed. The next s Stephanus and his house as given in I Cor. 1: 16.-' I baptized also the household of Stephanns.' - Now this instanceis not re- corded at all in the Acts, which goes to prove that many households might have been baptized without being mentioted, which facts, if related, perhaps, would hate embraced infants, or driven us to that conclusion." "Yet, that is not proving infant baptism, lr. Sumner. Give me a case where there was just one infant baptized?" "Why, sir, is not the house of Stephanus plain enough for any body? You cannot prove this time thIat there were any adults in it. There is nothing said about their hearing or believinq either What can you make of it? Let me answer for you. Nothing but that Stephanus was a believer, and his household was baptized on his faith." "Whether I can make anything of it ort not, there is one thing certain, you cannot prove that there was a sin- gle infant there, which if you do not, your proof-text is not worth a straw to your cause, since it is your duty to show me infant baptism." "But the inference is so plain." "Inferences were never taken as testimony, according to my knoNledge. You must show the fact." "1 cannot do that, I admit, but I'll leave the matter with the gentlemen present, whether this text can be set aside or not. Speak, gentlemen, all of you, and let Mr. Weston know what impression this is calculated to make on an unbiased mind." Ir. Semms was the first to speak. "s My honest opinion, Bro. Sumner, is; that the evidence is most conclusive." "No doubt but what you think so, Mr. Semms, but it - must be remembered that you are a Pedo, of which fact   - * .   THE INVESTTGTITO.      .. 233 arises a very natural conclusion that some partiality must be felt.. However, your verdict may be taken in. Let-Mr. Bacon,-and then the rest speak." All of them gave substantially the same opinion. "Then my cause is established!" exclaimed Mr. Sum- ner, rising to his feet. "Gentlemen," he continued, "although Mr. Weston has apparently set aside the in- stances of household baptism which I have brought up, this last one I think is fatal to the assumptions which he has made." "Pardon me, Mr. Sumner, but I cannot see how you can say that my argumentatioqs were assumptions when you yourself acceded to all the expositions I made." "Nevertheless, Mr. Weston, my last proof-text of In- fant baptism, proves conclusively that it was practiced in those instances. You know you cannot set this last aside, which you have as good as acknoledged." g   '"Nor would I set that passage aside for a world. You cannot prove thai infants were in that family. I can prove that there were not!" "How Mr. Weston? How do you dare presume to tamper with God's word in that manner? You know that there is not a word said about their believing or hear- ing.  "nWell, only hear your Pedobaptist, Dr. McnKmght speak about it: 'The family of Stephanus seems all to have been adults when they were baptized; for they are said, to have devoted themselves to the ministry of the Saints." I would like to know where Dr. McKnight got such notions fromv, He was no Methodist either, so I won't pin my faith to his sleeve." "I'll tell you where he got his testimony or notion from. 1 Cor. xvi: 15-' I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achai, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,') &amp;c.

"No, no; I am ashamed of myself for ever thinking so. I wonder that any one who can read the Bible. should imbibe such an impression. To tell the truth, I have never read anything but commentaries, and they were always by men who contended for sprinkling, so you can account for the impressions I have had.

THE INVESTIGATION     CONTINUED. THE RISE OF INFANT BAPTISM NOTHNG UNCOMMON, FOR PAl SAID: "After my departing shall grievous wolves enter in amor you, not sparing theflock."-Acts xx: 29. WEDNESDAY morning dawned in a sonibre, undisturbe cast. August had come with her dark green robe, as i contemplating mourning for autumn. The summer sn had ripened the hue from pea green to,a graver colo] worn in less perfunctory habit. Days had gone int weeks, and weeks into almost months, since the beginnin of this investigation, but the reader must remember tha only a little time was consumed each day, and many day passed without any progress. Mr. Bacon did not go to the library until all of th usual guests were assembled. And then he bent his step thither with much reluctance. The examination had in deed become a thorn in his pillow. His conscience wa never at rest, and had he known how his daughter had been operated on, his dreams would have been even more gloomy. The truth is, he would have forthwith caused i suspension of progressing affairs. Mr. Weston was to hold the laboring oar to-day, ae usual. Mr. Sumner knew that historians could not save bin now. His case was desperate. "You remember, gentlemen," began Mr. Weston "that there was no evidence of infant baptism in the eBi- ble. Now my friend here must prove that it began or that it was practiced from the Apostles' door, or the scheme is forever gone from his hands." "You know, Mr. Weston, that it cannot be traced tc the Apostolic age, or the end of this era, but I think sc   THE INVESTIGATION.        241 near, that no candid man, can but believe that it was prac- ticed by the Apostles." "Well, let us hear your historians, and then judge from their tenor, about it." "That infant baptism was practiced very near the Apos- tolic age, cannot be disputed. Ireneus, one of the most ancient writers, and Christians too, writes as follows: 'Therefore, as le was a Master, he had also the age of a Master. Not disdaining, nor going in a way above hu- man nature, nor breaking in his own person, the law which he had set for mankind; but sanctifying every sev- eral age by the likeness that it has to him. For he ce e to save all persons by himself: all, I mean, who by him are regenerated unto God, infants and little ones, and children and youths, and elder persons. Therefore, he went through the several ages: for infants, being made I   an infancify    infants: to little ones, he was made   a little one, sanctifying those of that age: and also giving them an example of godliness, justice, and dutifulness: - to youths, he was a youth,' &amp;c. "j Now to ascertain the strength of this, we must know what he meant by regeneration. You will admit that it ;:   was baptism, Mr. Weston?" "I'll make no such admiission, but go on." ;   "Polycarp, you know, wasla disciple of John; Ireneus was a disciple of Polycarp. Now we see that there was but a single individual between Ireneus and the Apos- tles. Not more than a century!  Could infant bap- tism have sprung up in that short time?-almost in the ]    i asight of the Apostolic age?" asked Mr. Sumner, with a glow of satisfaction. ' We do not know that Ireneus meant baptism by the term regeneration, or 'regenerated unto God.' If he did, we must conclude that he was a very illogical reasoner, if he represents Christ's different periods of life, regener- ating different ages of persons, by baptism, when Christ himself was baptized only at one age! But he does not , {  say that sanctification of infants came by baptism, but by Christ's being made an infant, sanctifying infants'! l He doei not say that regeneration came by baptism to little ones,' but that Christ was 'made a little one, sanc- tifying those of-that age' by that act. The same is said of youths and older persons. Ireneus does not make 're-. 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC8270-00000124"/> S242     -LZEAD EER   ALL.- generated unto God' dependent on baptism, but on the several ages which Christ went through. So, Mr. Sum- ner, that is no proof of infant baptism yet, for no one can think that Ireneus meant baptism, by the term 're. generated unto God.' I will now anticipate you. All historians agree that there is no proof of infant baptism before the latter part of the second century, or the first of the third. Ireneus was not cotemporary with any one who spoke directly on infant baptism. The writers of the second century, which were Justin Martyr, Athenagaras, Theophilus of Antioch, Titian, Minucius Felix, Ireneus, and Clement of Alexandria, never, once mention infant baptism. Though it was not impossible that such an in- novation should spring up in that time, yet there is no evidence that it did, or we must conclude the above Chris- tian writers were very lax as to details of such an impor- tant thing, as it would have been ternid.1 "But when did it begin? Hear the voice of historians, as they agree in dates, and then let us find its beginning. "C" rcellaus: ' The baptism of infants, in the two first -centuries after Christ, was altogether unknown; but in the third and fourth, was allowed by few. In the fifth and following ages, it began to obtain in divers places. The custom of baptizing infants did not begin before the third age after Christ.' "Chambers: 'It appears that-in the primitive times, none were baptized but adults.' "Bishop Barlow: 'I do believe and know: that there is neither precept, nor example in the Scripture for Pedo- baptism, nor any just evidence for it for about two hun- dred years after Christ.' "Walafriduts Strabo: 'In the primitive times the ordi- - nance of baptism was administered only to those who, through perfection of body and mind, understood what profit they received by baptism; what was to be profes- sed, what to be believed; and lastly, what was to be ob- served by those that were born again in Christ.' "There are many others that might be quoted here, but we have not time. We see that it is generally con- ceded that it began in the latter part of the second, or first of the third century. Now let us learn what kind of infants they were, and- where it began. Robinson, a celebrated historian, writes: 'Few writers have been so   TIE trNV-sTIGATIoN.       -24 often quoted in controversy concerning infant baptism-as Tertullian, and yet the subject is not so much as men- tioned by this father. They are boys and not babes, of whose baptism he (Tertullian) writes.' "Bishop Victor's account of the Church at Carthage, agrees with this distinguished writer. He says: 'There were in the Church at Carthage, when Engenius was bishop, a great many little infant readers, who rejoiced in the Lord, and suffered persecution with the rest of their  brethren.' 'i  t' II another plade he says, 'There was in the Church at Carthage a man named Thencarius, who used to'read, -i   and was master of the singers-twelve df these were little -::iA infants. There were also little infants, who in times of persecution, ran up and down the streets crying: 'We are Christians; iWe are          Christians,' and as they repeated this three times, both catholics and arians thought they held the doctrine of Trinity: the latter knocked them on the head, and the former regis- tered them for martyrs. There were seven monks put to death; Maximus a little infant, was one. The officer pitied his youth, and tried to persuade him to recant. No, said he, nobody shall persuade me to leave my father Ab- ot, and my brethren. Do you think you can seduce me because I am young? If I deny Christ before men, he will deny me before his father in heaven.' "Cardinal Bellarmine, observes: 'Thus we were led into the mistake by applyinog to natural infants what Origen had said only of youths and adults. Origen's in- fants were capable of repentance and martyrdom: but infants of the reformers were incapable of either.' "Now what is this we have before us? That the in- fants, so called, who were baptized anciently were not babes, but large enough to understand what they were about. "The great Alexandrian school which was set up about the latter part of the second century, was the beginning of this innovation. Pantaneus first kept this school; he was succeeded by Clement, and Clement by Origen. Here minor baptism begsra by young men under age, such as were capable of reading and singing. It stood thus in the heirarchies for centuries.* In Tertullian's time, the question *Rob.

But Tertullian advises the deference of infant bap- tism, or the baptism of little children who could ask for bap- tism but were to have sponsors, because they were under age. He advises this delay, because he thought such un- certainties of fulfilment of duty, should not be depended on. This was a neworder of infants, younger than the first admitted into the Church, consequently not as capa- ble of discerning the body of Christ. Tertullian was a man who sought for the purity of the cause, and objected to Christ's Church being filled with the world. Neander, a Pedobaptist, gives his opinion, about Ter- tullian, thus: -" t'But immediately after Ireneus, in the latter years of the second century, Tertullian appeared as a zealous op- ponent of infant baptism, a proof that it was not then usually considered as an apostolic ordinance, for in that case he would hardly have ventured to speak so strongly against it.' "The infants which Clement received into the-Church were capable of reading and singing--school boys. Ori- gen's infants were some martyrs, none considered babes but his pupils. The infant baptism, which Tertullian op- posed, were of those that were capable of askinq for bap. tism. Bishop Victor speaks of infants of those days as being boys large enough to know what they were doing, to be martyred for their cause. Cardinal Bellarumine tells that Origen's infants were subject to martyrdom. We also have an account of numerous individuals, born of Christian, parents of those days, after becoming grown, of being baptized -- Cprian, Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome. 'Nectariis, -and many others were horn, some about the first of the third century and others shortly af- terwards; all were of Christian parents, yet their bap- tism was deferred until they became grown. Why, if in- fant baptism was universal and uninterrupted, as Dr. Wall says it was, why I ask, were there so many born of Christian parents whose baptism was deferred until man- hood? I think with Dr. Neander, that it was not an apostolic ordinance, and not a universal practice, or such would not have been the case.   THE INVESTIGATION.        245 "'History tells us that infants of those days, (that is of the last-of the second century, and afterwards,) who were admittedinto the Church were boys or girls (perhaps) large euough to be trained in choirs, and reading classes. Origen is said to have written a book, calling Christ the PEDAGOGUE, and his disciples little children, and infants; and that he represents hinself and school. Where now is the first of babe baptism? (as we have to term it by way of contradistinction.) ": Hear the historian Robinson: ' The baptism of babes first appeared in the most ignorant and impure part of the catholic world, Africa. It was not the ofspring of critical learning or sound philosophy, for it sprang up among men destitute of both; nor did any one ever take the Afiican fathers for philosophers or critical investiga- tors of the sacred oracle of God; and if they all be taken for moral men, they are overprized, for in spite of their vain boast of an orthodox faith, they were pagans and blasphemers, who worshipped idols in secret, and dedica- ted their children to demons. There was no crime that they did not practice; perjury, debauchery of every spe- cies, oppression, tyranny and wickedness .of every kind, so that the people groaned for a revolution. When, in the time of Augustine, the vandals surrounded Carthage to beseige it, the members of the Church were lyin ing i x- ury at the play, or at some public amusement, and the poor were more wretched and more wicked than they had ever been under the Romans. 'There was a ferocity in the manners of the old Car- thagenians, and their history is full of examples of the- cruel inseisibility, with which they shed the blood of citi- zens as well as foreigners. This felrocity they carried into their religion. When Agathocles was upon the point of beseigiug Carthage, the inhabitants imputed their misfor- tune to the anger of Saturn, because instead of children of the first quality, which they used to sacrifice to him, they had fraudulently substituted the children of slaves and strangers. To make amends for this pretended crime, they sacraficed twio hundred children of the best families of Carthage to that God! A brazen statue was set up, its two arms, brought' almost together, were -extended downwards over a fierce fire. The mothers kissed and decoyed their children into mirth, lest the god should be  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8270-00000126"/> /*v v      Xi J^ / I . i 1 Ui A ..L al * offended with the ungracefulness of his worshippers. The priests were habited in scarlet, and the victims in a purple vest. The children were laid upon the arms of the statue, and rolled from thence into the fire, and a rou'gh music drowned their shrieks lest mothers should hear and re- lent'!!! "Writes Mr. Westlake: 'Amobng such a people as is above described, lived Fidus, the first on records who pro- posed the baptism of infants, (babes.) And though, as Wall intimates, he was but an indifferent man for a bish-- op, yet he might be shocked at such horrid abominations. It is more than probable that Fidus bethhought himself of baptizing these little ones, asan expedient to save them from the arms of the brazen statue, and from the devour- ing flame. "Here Mr. Wall makes a distinction between the bap- tism of infants in the early days, that is of the first of the third century; other authors mostly agree, that the in- fants then were young men under age." "Well, I cant see why that helps the cause, Mr. Wes- ton. If anything I should think it made the matter worse. If as you say, those who were called infants first baptized into the Church at the Alexandrian school, were young men, orboys large' enouglb to read, I think it makes :he matter worse, for they were not as innocent as babes." "Yet, the baptism of babes and the baptism of infants liffer in this. The baptism of mere minors found its )rigin in the midst of philosophy and learning, and the )aptism of the latter with- the Pope, and in a bed of ig- lorance and superstition. No wonder Pedo-baptists set Oo 1 ick value oi this institution, since it was the means if preserving infants from the brazen statue of destruc- ion. The idea of utility never came from the Bible, but lrom the heathen!"  "With all your citations of history, Mr. Weston, I lon't see now but that infant baptism bordered very near n the Apoltolic days." - "I admit that it did. I admit the Alexandrian school re- sognized infant baptism, or baptism of persons under age, )ut you-must remember, Mr.: Sumner, that was not what  l rouiterm infant baptism. You are-looking for the bap  ism of babes, these were only minors. Bnt grantiug  hat-it was all the same, (though it was not) and that you   can trace infant baptism to the days of Ireneus, what does that prove for you?"                i "Very much. First that it was so near the apostolic age that such innovations could not have crept into the Church, so infant baptism was not an innovation, but a practice of the Apostles." a "Yet, I have proven that they baptized none, only on a confession of faith. There is not a single case in the Bible, where any one was baptized, who was not capable of believing.' "But you forget the short space of time that intervened between that age and the account of infant, or minor baptism." "No, I do not. I know, however, that that infant baptism was not the kind you practice, nor did yours take its origin from that age, but arose afterwards, as I have told you, from the midst of wickedness and super- stition and born in the arms of Catholicism! Even if they were the same, even if you could trace babe-baptism back to the beginning of the third century, what does that matter? Iow long, I would ask, has it been since the revolution out of which sprang our great Republic?" "Not a century yet." "And look what changes? Who would have thought a hundred years ago that such a nation, and such a re- public would have grown up in the coming century? And more still. Look at the lapse of three short years, and what changes time has wrought George Washing- ton is almost forgotten! Yea, the Republic with its cul- minated glory has changed! In three years!!

Suchis the tenor of our writers, and such are the changes of time. Even in the Apostolic days here- sies began to creep into the Church. Are not the Apos- tles' writings fall of reproofe and warnlings? Paul was phophetic he-foretold these innovations, and of early coming. Hear him as with a )predictive vision he looks forward: "'Take heed, therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Ioly Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath pur- chased with his own blood. For I knoz this, that aftermy depvrtinq shall grierous w-olves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.'-Acts xx: 28, 29. "'These things would come immediately, then is it im- probable that after the apostles were dead and gone, that men should, of the Church 'arise, speak perverse things, to draw away disciples after theit"?  That the Republic of the United States should rise and fluctuate to its pres- ent crisis in less than a century, is somethint to wonder at, but the introduction of this single innovation in God's Chiurch, entrsted with men, in a century is nothing to compare in magnitude to the former il, regard to wonder.

He did not tnst himself to look at Annie, for he felt instinctively that she was lost to him,   T11 INVESTIGATION.       249 "I am not jesting Mr. Sumner, about this. I do want to know whether you have any more imaginary help ahead or not," persisted Mr. Weston. "If I were to bring up the whole Bible in support of my position you would not believe it. You are certainly the most unreasonable man I ever saw, on this point. Out of all the argument I brought up yesterday, you would not grant one bit of it to pass, but just explained away every passage to suit yourself." ( Pardon me, Mr. Sumner, but I do think you do me great injustice by saying that. In the onset I asked you for your proof of infant baptism, and you took me to the Old Testament to find an ordinance that exclusively be- longs to the New! You went to the covenant of Abra- ham to find infant baptism! Now I would suppose if we are responsible creatures, and to be judged by the Bible, I should think it is plain enough for any one to under- stand who can read, as far as his duty goes. The New Testament tells us plainly that every individual who be- *lieves in God, ought to be baptized, but to learn from the covenant that it is our duty to baptize our children, 'it would take a man of common sense almost his life time to find it out! even if it were so. A man can learn in five minutes from the Bible, that. it is his duty to be baptized as soon as he is pardoned, but his children can be born and grow up to manhood, before he can learn  from the covenant of circumcision that it is his duty to have them baptized! "But to return to this recapitulation. "You pointed me to the covenant of circumcision, we  examined it closely, and both concluded that there were  no spiritual blessings sealed thereby to any body^ but Abraham, so we concluded that that could not be the  Church. We read of a covenant of grace in the New Testament made with Abraham. We looked and found  it given to him when in Urr of Chaldea, in his seventy-  fifth year, twenty-four years before the-covenant of cir- cumcision, and four hundred and thirty years before theI giving of the law, which when chronologically computa- ted, carries us back to Abraham in Urr of Chaldea, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. Well, we concluded  this the Church, but found that it was not visible until    .      .    1  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC8270-00000128"/> 250       L E ANDEB HALL.  the coming of Christ. Then we were brought to the New Testament, where we ought to have been at first, as an invisible Church could h'ave no ordinantces. I asked for your grounds'there for infant baptism, and you point- ed me to the commission, which I found applied onlyto belierers. Then you pointed me to Christ 'blessing little children, yet I saw nothing of i-nfant baptism, and which yot yourself acknowledged that it had no reference to it. ' Afterwards you carried me to a place where Paul used the word holy and sanctified in a physical sense, you concluding that infants were fit subjects for baptism by that, but as there was not the most distant reference to baptism of any kind, and as it proves if the child was sanctified in a moral sense, so must the unbelieving wife or husband! therefore you found that it .would prove too much for you and you gave that up. "I still insisted for some grounds of infant baptism, and you carried me to the Acts of the Apostles, to the household baptisms, but I found no instanceof this ordi- nance being administered to any but tlose who believed,' as you yourself acknowledged. "Still I thirsted for some evidence, and you took me to the ancient historian Ireneus, but in the end he could prove nothing, since he was not an inspired writer, and lived near- ly a century after the Apostle's day, giving the Church time to become corrupted with any device of man, unless it dis- sented from the mass of bogus worshipers. Still I thirst for grounds, or the institution is deposed, and ought to be abandoned forever by those who love God's Church, and wish to keep it pure from the world." "But Mr. Weston what harm can there be in just sprinkling a few drops of water on little innocent babes?" asked Mr. Semms who had been a silent listener. "I would ask you what good does it do?" "None whatever Iknow, but since it is in the Church and so many hold with it, I should think they ought to  have their way about it, as it does no harm." "Then you think they have a right to do this?" "Certainly, certainly, our civil liberty grants us that.' "And it has ever been granted and enforced through- out all ages, on the people., Inftnt baptism has never been persecuted. Man neer perstes his own devices. The devil never suffers his institutions to be persecuted   TIE INVESTIGATION.        Oi: by tyranny, or blood. He stands between them and the world, but the Bible lie will not bar himself agailnst." '",You are too hard, Mr. Weston. You must not say that infiant baptism is an institution of the devil! You are taking too much latitude!"'exclaimed Mr. Sumner.  "I do say and contend that all institutions outside of the Church of Christ are of the devil! and will, in time, fall!"   ' "Why, Mr. Weston, what grounds have you for such a notion?"  This; the devil offered to give our Saviour all the kingdoms of'the earth if he would only relinquish his  kingdom and worship him. Had they not been of the devil, that is, mixed with his suggestions and cunning de- vices, then the Saviour would have rebuked him, for boasting of posse5ssi)ns that did not belong to him. "But lhe may have done it for aught we know." "Then it would have been recorded, for, believe me, God left nothing out of inspiration that should have been chronicled. God's Church is sufficient government for any man. All outside allegiances are unneedful to the purity and government of a Christian." "Then you would dispense with civil government, to Carry out that theory." "No, not at all. You must remember that all are not Christians. The world at large needs some restrictions, or violence' would take it by force. As sinners are not of Christ, it does not matter if they are held in check by institutions, in which the devil is concerned. Christians live under those institutions too, but that does not stand that they are necessary to their orderly behavior, nor should they be the incentive of duty. But to return. I. think you said that infant baptism does no harm. Look at Europe! every body belongs to the qChurch, sinners and all. Look at Alexander Carson's first congregation  That poor pious soulwas grieved sorely at the wicked- ness of his charge. His members attended Church in  the morning and went to the race track in the evening, on the Sabbath! He saw that there must be a change, and so there was.

You are not Christ's Church in ordinances, hi visible Church is distinguished by its ordinances, so tc whait Paul says, I agree: ' Now I BESEECH YOU, BRETHREN MARK THEM WHCH CAUSE DIVISIONS AND OFFENCES CONTRARY TO THE DOCTRINE WHCH YE HAVE LEARNED, AND AVOID THEM.' Rom. xvi. 11." "Yet, Mr. Weston, it is a right guaranteed by our civil laws, and not at all antagonistic to a Christian feeling, and as we have the right, why not let all who believe in it, practice it?" "It is indeed a right guaranteed by civil liberty, but sir, in the sight of God and his laws, you have no right to practice it! Did 'Christ ever command the baptism of any one who did not believe in him? Then would you, knowing this, in his name, baptize an unregenerated per. son?" "But little infants are so innocent." 'I know they are innocent, as far as present knowl- edge is concerned, but Christ said, all must be born again' to enter his Church, not' of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.' David says: 'Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother con- ceive me;' is the kingdom of heaven to be composed of such? Nay verily. Christ says we must be 'born again,' to enter his Church. As infants are incapable of exer- cising faith, or appreciating- the blood of Christ in their natural state, and as that state is of depravity, then they have no right to Church membership; nor of baptism, unless you make it a regenerating process, as our Reformer friends do." "Oh no; we do not pretend to do that." "And yet the idea of baptizing infants sprang from such a notion. I might quote a hundred of your fathers to that efect." "They might have been in error in thinking thus." "And so in introducing the practice. Now, Mr. Semms, I ask you candidly, do you think the practice of infant   THE  IXVEBTIGATION.       258 baptism accords with the teachings of Holy Writ?- Have you any plea therein, justifying a shadow of such a thing?" "I cannot say that we have, Mr. Weston. I have of- fered every excuse in the world, that I could think of; but it seems when looked into, were of no strength at all. Perhaps, Bro. Sumner here, is saving something for the last. Speak, Bro. Sumner, and don't let our cause appear so desperate," he said, turning to Mr. Sumner with an anxious look. "It is altogether useless, Bro. Semms, for me to make any further eflort: Mr. Weston will have his way about it. He is welcome to his opinion. I hope he will grant me the same liberty." (That was not the way ie talked at first, the reader will remembet. "But a change had come over the spirit of his dreams.") "As to granting you the liberty of having any. opinion that you wish, I have nothing to do with that personally, but this sacred volume, the Bible, has. You have no right to practice anything in the Church, which it does not teach. You may presume that right from civil au- thority, but from inspiration, never. To do such a thing, would be trespassing on God's authority. It would be equal to an assertion, that his Church as regards gov- erumnent and ordinances was incomplete. Such is sacri- lege. or worse, if conceivable. It is my duty as a mem- ber of the Church of Christ, for its cause, to expose all heresies,or innov;ttionu that conie under my observation, because I do not now belong to myself, but to God. Though I may meet with doctrine of seemingly plausible appearance, it makes lno difference, if it does not accord with the teachings of the Bible, it is my duty and obliga- tion to fight it with orthodox argument to the last. I know this is a very unpopular position for any one to take, nevertheless, it is no less obligatory. on me as a ser- vant of God, dedicated to his cause. But this is monop- oly. I want to ask you one question, and we will leave this subject. Do you now dare to continue this practice, since we have found it wholly unauthenticated by com- mand, precept, or example in our Standard Book? An- swer me this, Mr. Sumner, and I ask no more questions at piesent." Mr. Sumner screwed about in his chair for several mo-  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC8270-00000130"/> ments, not knowing what reply to make. But-he must speak. He saw it. He cast a searching look at Annie; her countenance revealed nothing but interest. The ihought suggested itself that perhaps her decision would turn on his response. Thus prompted he made one more struggle.'  "You know, Mr. Weston, that the wisest and best men have differed on this subject. Men who have had better opportunities of judging than we, have clupg to this in. stitution, and men too, who we must know were influen. ced by purest motives. It is somewhat of a compl:icated affhir, any way, but if those- who made the Bible their study-all their days, still conceded its practice, certainly we muist think they saw reasons for it which we cannot see. Therefore,I rather trust them, than those who know  comparatively but little about these things." "That is indeed a poor excuse, Mr. Sumner! How can you, professing to be a minister of the. gospel, have the face to teach such doctrine? Popes were wise men! is that a pleaffor their innovations, commensurate with  the Bible's, against infant baptism?J! Those who perse- cuted the Wadenses, the Albigenses, the Vaudois, and others of these classes, they were wise men, and practiced infant baptism to the destruction and death of many of these pious souls; arethose facts to be accounted as ortho- dox? Why, sir, one half of the blood of the saints, which was spilled by the Pope and his cohorts, was in consequence of the nonconformity to infant baptism by the martyrs! All these facts, according to yo r notion, must go to prove that infant baptism was commanded by Christ, and taught by the Apostles, as wise men enforced this law!!! You charge me with being selfish because I do not commune with you. You ask me for my rea- sons. Here are some. You have not been baptized. Your society is-composed partly of the world.

Will you not grant now that I am justifiable -in holding to close communion? Paul jnstifies me even in more, viz: of keeping away from yote altogether. What if yotur Popes, Prolates, or Bishops of  first, second and tird order, do contend for such false re- ligion-? hath not God chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise? And hath he not chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty? Do you longer urge that untenable plea for infant baptism? And can you still persecute me for close communion? If you do, you persecute me for that wich the Bible tells me to do, therefore, reason and Christian spirit are not your incentives, but an inheritance of p relatic and popish sirit, which naturally descends to the branches of the Chbrch of Rome.!" Mr. Sumner did not demur, for he felt too sensibly the truth of this accusation. Let every Methodist read-their history, and the truth of this assertion will establish itself. Dr. Boon, in his compassion, proposed a suspension for the day, for lhe Saw that the young preacher was badly used up, and should such another current sweep over, he was fearful that the chances for his friend's safety would be gone. "I suppose we will meet. again to-morrow, gentlemen," said Mr. Weston, rising to start.  "Yes, we must meet again, for I am very anxious to hear the finale of this subject," said Mr. Semms, also rising to start. "s As to that," said Mr. Weston, "you have the finale, or about it, of infant baptism, but the Church, the Meth- odist Church is to be more minutely investigated, so that I may allege reasons for not communing with it, in a corn- plete style. Though, in further investigations, we may find the Methodist Discipline a paragon, of perfection as to rule, so I will not anticipate.

THE CONVERSATION, WRBERBY, DR. BOON IS EXERCISED, BECAUSE, "Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission."-- Heb. ix.- 22. IN taking up the train of events, we must not fail to notice -one in connection with Mollie Weston and Dr. Boon, as it is so nearly allied to the sequel of this book. We have before given the reader a hint of his predilec- tion for the preacher's daughter, but as it was so repug- nant to his feelings to visit a Baptist preacher's house, he had only made one or two calls on the girl whom he ad- mired more than any other. Time had sped on. It had been his fortune to-meet with her several times at Mr. Ba- con's house, but alwaysin company. Such accidental meet. ings only enhanced his adrairation, so as he became more intimately acquainted witl Mr. Weston, his peculiar sen- sations wore away, and he determined to visit Mollie, even at the sacrifice of some indefinable notions of reluctance, or something, he could not tell what.  Dr. Boon's prejudices against close communion, had been in a degree removed. He liad-begun to see matters as they stood, without false embellishments of "Christian Spirit," liberality," &amp;c. But he wondered why the Bap- tists could refuse to commune with his Church, as it was so near like, in form and ordinances. He gave himself up to the cogitation ofrthe subject, as he wended his way to the preacher's house that night after tea. So deeply was his mind impressed with such thought, that he had hardly exchanged civilities of salutations with Mollie Weston, before hle introduced his foremost  theme.

I can't see why-he refuses to commune with the Reformers, they are so near lilke the Baptists. In fact the difference is a mere shadow.' "Allow me to correct you there, Doctor. You are greatftmistaken! There is a vast difference! You deny the influence of the Holy Spirit-" "stop, Miss Weston! I hope you are not going off into such humbuggery!

We have the testimony of the four Evangelists to- that effect, besides evidences from the Apostles. What mlore have you?" "The conviction is here, Doctor, (aying her hasnd on: her heart) stronger than the impressiofns received 'from  the Bible, by reading. I read the Bible, and doubted not its testimony, but hear me, I never knew whvat the tHoly Spirit was, until my heart, with all of its doubts and mere assents to the truths, were changed to belief and reliance  I have never doubted the religion of Christ. I have al- ways given an assent to its reality, but to say that I felt or knew that it was a reality, I did not, prior to my con- vertion. Did you ever doubt that Jesus was the son 'of God?" "No; but I never felt it my duty to be baptized until.. Bro. Sampson made it so plain one night during a pro . tracted meeting, that all the world could not have made me believe otherwise."  "And why did you not conceive it your duty before?" "Ohr-ell, as to that I always felt it a duty and privi- lege too, but never felt it so incumbent on me for imme- diate action." "And can you think, Dr. Boon, that one born in ini- quity, and living in iniquity, could be a fit subject for Christ's Church, without the regenerating influence of the Holy Spirit?" But baptism-you forget it. The Holy Spirit is an accompaniment of baptism."

"Then it follows that we are to be baptized every tim we sin.' 4-Oh no, Miss Weston, you mistake me altogether." "Well, explain yourself." "It is this: When we are baptized, our sils are all for given because we have' followed Christ, or to use th popular expression, we ,have'put on Christ,' and shoulk follow him afterwards," "And yet you teach doctrine fatal to that theory. Youo members fall away, or apostatize, you receive them back into your Church without rebaptizing them, how I woulc ask you, are their last sins to be forgiven, if baptism ii for the remission of sins? If sins are to be forgiven on( way in one case, they are to be the same way in all cases N'owI know, to my certain knowledge, that some of youl members have committed enormous sins, and have beer received back into the bosom of the Church without bap tisn, how were those sins, forgiven?-or were they taker back with the guilt resting on their hearts." But, you must admit Miss Westonl that we are com. manded to be baptized for the remission of sins," said the Doctor, essaying to bring attention from the poini they were discussing. 4' 1 do indeed, Dr. Boon."- '- Then why do you argue against me?" 'I do not take the expression: 'Repent and be bap- tized for the remission of sins,' as you do. I believe il means, 'Repent since Clrist has died for your sins--his ,   . blood is for the remissionu of your sins if you will repent and turn to himn. Now since your sins are forgiven, you must be baptized because of this remission.' I would askyou a question here: If baptism is fir the remission of sins in the sense you take it, what is the office of the blood of Christ? Whyt the necessity of its being spilled?" Dr. Boon could not answer this.. Can any Campbell- ite:? We trow-not. "Oh, weli, let us talk about something else," he said after seeing that there was nothing to be gained. "Allow me to make one more point here Doctor, and then I will engage in any other theme of conversation - you wish. Do you renmember Mrs. Kent, who died about three weeks ago?

What is essential to salvation in one case, is in another. If baptism is for remission in one, it must be alike in allcases; for we are not told of a plurality of plans of redemption. If the blood of Christ, applied by the Holy Spirit, is essential to salvation in one case, the same process must be in all, nor. have we any right to believe that it has an alternate, or that it has ever been supercded by baptism.

In vain afterwards, did he court the favors of "balmy rest," but he as was wont, paid his visits where least desired. Annie Bacon found herst. tf alone immediately after the breaking up of the company that morning. There was nmuch for her to ponder, and worse she had no mother with whotn to advise. Her only resort was to send for  Mollie Weston, and make known her intentions and ask her counsel. Mollie came over directly hfter dinner. She saw at once that some tearful resolution was in the beart of her friend. She seated herself close by her, and stole her ai'm gently around her waist in a consoling manner. "I have sent for you," said Annie, taking Mollies hand in her own, and looking in her face, "to ask your as- sistanlce." "In what?" "About that matter which we talked of the other day. I have come to a determinate resolution. I cannot for- bear to do my duty any longer. Sunday morning, if the Church deems me wortlhy, I intend tob-e baptized into Christ's only and true. Church. I know it willcost a fearful effort, and perhaps a great sacrifice, but I hope to be equal to the task by the grace of God. I know when I leave my father's house to walk in the ranks of God's people, I must relinquish my right and welcome to that shelter. But it must be d(one. Now I want to know what I am to do afterwards? I must have sonme employ- ment, and it is time that - was looking it out. I have sent for you to gain your information about it. Do you know any vacancy, which I could fill? I can teach mu- sic or the solid branches either, only I want -to know where to direct my attention." "Annie," said Mollie, after a moment of silence, "have you considered thoroughly the cost of what you are con- templating?" "I have, Mollie, and I know the fiture looks impervi- ous to any source of happiness, but I will trust to Prov- idence."  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC8270-00000134"/> "I will not dissuade you Annie from your duty, though in the performance thereof, your prospect would be an unvaried scene of sorrow, yet I cannot anticipate it thus, for He who watches the fall of the little sparrow, will not overlook his people. Since Christ has died for us, we ought to be willing to live to his honor if in Our power." "But you have not told me Mollie, of any prospect for future sustenance. Do you know of any?" "I believe I do. Madame Morris has a school in B-, in which I think are several vacancies. But Annie you D need not do that. Come and live with me. Pa has plenty for us all, and I know yon would be welcomb." 4-I thank you Mollie, bat I cannot do that. I cannot stay so near my home,"-and she burst into tears as-the thought of leaving rushed into her mind with its con- nectionLs. "But your father may relent." "No, no, no, never! He is as obdurate as a rock. I know him better than you. I must write to Madame Morris immediately." "But stay arith me awhile," pleaded Mollie. "It would be too painful Mollie, to stay here in sight of my home. I will leave M-- on Monday morning early, by the first packet. I will go to B--- at any rate and see what I a-ando." "Wien will you write?" "Now. The letter can leave town this evening. I shall not expect an answer." "You will be going on a great uncertainty." "I know I will, but I cannot stay in M-- longer than Monday. I know my father's anger will be impla- cable; it would be useless for any one to try to effect a reconciliation, so the sooner I go, the better." "Well, Annie, I can do no more for you now. I will see you again before next Sabbath. Have courage, and I feel assured it will all come rightin time." Annie was left alone again. Who can visit the sanc- tuary of that troubled heart, and record its emotions? She sat one moment in reflection, with her hands cov- ering her face. Then she arose and wrote to Madame Morris. Oh the anguish of that young heart, as for the tirst time it was begging the cpagrties of tin cold an4 lt    'feeling world! She had been raised in opulence--not a wish ungratified, nor a want unsupplied-but a period was at halld when her maintenance was to come from her own hands! She trembled as she penned a hasty epistle to the Madame, asking employment. The letter written, and sealed, she directed it, and dis- patched a servant with it to the post office, without de- lay. And then she sat down and wept bitterly. There was another dreadful task before Annie. This de- terminatioln must bc lliade knoiWn to Mr. Sumner! She! had not thought of the fact of its being a barrier to their union, until while reflecting after the writing of that fear- ful epistle to Madame Morris, wnen the words-of r. Taylor came to her mind, and oh! the depth of her sor- row, who can tell? True, she had on the evening she re- ceived the lecture, resolved to do her duty, but she had lost -siglt of the warningl he gave her during thie liutcr- vening time, but now her cup was full to overfiowinzi. This new revelation, as it burst on her mental vision, (did not falter her resolution howe ver, thoughl we must know, it added excess of sorrow to her already pent up grief. How was she to communicate this to Mr. Sumner? It would not do to write, ftr she could not tell half what she desired. She must see him alone, and give her rea- sons. But when? Only three days were to elapse before Sunday; in that time the task must be done. She re- colved to make the communication the next day, after the hours of discussion were over. We will note her success in due tinme.  But what has become of our friend Mrs. Crow, and her allies? Let us take a peep into her parlor on Wednesday evening, when the news went out that Mr. Sumner had made a signal failure. Mrs. Standford, Mrs. Glover, Mrs. Brown, and Miss Matilda Lankinston were there, with a new addition, as polite parlance termed, Mrs. Dr. Moore. There was not as great a degree' of hilarity afloat as usu- al, since the sad tidings of Mr. Sumner's ill luck had beent circulated, but our heroines felt a high degree of impor- tance, as they engaged joiutly in prognostication, and plans of future aid.. r No, we will no t stand agog, with hands folded, when our cause is in need of assistance!" exclaimed Mrs. Crow, accompanying her sentences with a terrible motion;, by: a - .. ..  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC8270-00000135"/> 264       LBANDER  HALL.  forcible swinging to and fro of her chair, suited to the vehemence of her tone. The subject had been introduced by some one of the amateur sisters, and that was the consequent reply. "But how are we to help him?. I know I amr willing to do anything in my power," put in the veritable Miss Lankinston. "And-you did help him once," suggested Mrs. Stand- ford, with a smile of approval, at the recollection of what consternation she imagined it pread through the Baptist community, when Miss Matilda Laukinston joined the Methodists. "Oh I have it-yes, I have it!" exclaimed Mrs. Crow, giving a strong physical motion as an accompaniment to er words.  '   What, Sister Crow?" was a simultaneous inquiry made, as a half dozen voices arose in eager expectation. "It is the best plan that can be hit on-" - "But what is it?" "It will fix up things about right." "Do tell us what it is, Mrs. Crow?" asked Mrs. Dr. Moore, as she drew nearer the speaker with an anxious air. "It is this. Let us all show the Baptists that we do not care for Mr. Weston's raid on infant baptism, by having all the children in our families nprinkled!" 'But I am afraid none of the members have any but' whathave been baptized. Do you know of any, Mrs. Crow?" :"Well no, I believe I do not. Bro. Sumner has always been very strict about that," responded Mrs. Crow, with an air of perplexity. "Such a pity you are not a member of the Church, Mrs. Moore. You could have your children baptized now. I know you like the Methodists best, for your pa- rents were Methodists," said Miss Lankinston, in a dep- recating tone. - "Yes, I do like them best," was a ready rejoinder. "They are not so selfish as the Baptists," she'continued, "and don't make so much fuss about the quantity of wa- ter for salvation, like the Reformers." "But can't you have your children baptized anyhow?" skd  r 4rs,- Qlover.   THE INVESTIGATION.        265 I don't know. Can I, Mrs. Crow?" "Well, really, Mrs. Moore, I can't say. I believe we baptized children on the faith of their parents, though I reckon one exception wouldn't hurt. Let's ask Bro. Sumner."                      ; "Yes, that will be the very thing. He certainly won't object to transgressing the rules a little, when so much good will come ofit. I just want the Baptists to see that we don't care a fig for Mr. Weston's great bughear of objections to infant baptism. So we will ask Bro. Sumner," and Miss Matilda gave her head a toss of grat- ification at the idea.  "When will any of you get to see Mr. Sumner?" "I'll see him 00soon," responded Miss Lankinston quick- ly, fearing some one else might choose that mission. H' ow soon, Miss Matilda?" "Between now and next Snuldv." .L' "And if he. consent, when ;will there be an opportu-  nity of baptizing?" "I don't know. Those bigoted Baptists have meeting here next Sunday. Such a pity it is not Bro. Sumner's day, so there might not be any delay about it." "Oh, I have it!" exclaimed Mrs. Crow, rocking as usual. "What?-do tell, Sister Crow!"' r  "You remember that Bro. Sumner preaches here next Sunday night, don't you?"J "Yes."        -  "Well, won't that do as well as any other time?"  "Yes, unless the Baptists hold a meeting here too at the same time. I want all of them to see it. You know  'if Mr. Weston preaches, they will all go to hear hiin." , "But Mr. Weston never preaches but once a day,; he. pretends like he is too feeble 'What a blessed thing for us!-they will all be out to see it, and how badly it will make them feel! Well, the Baptists will find out, I hope, that there is nothing to be made off of us." "I think they have found that out already.-" "Yes, so do I, but I want to give them a good dose  . before the thing is done with. Do you know, Sister Crow, t Whether Bro. Sumner intends protracting the meetingt next week or not? You know there was some talk of it at our last Church meeting. 23                 .   &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC8270-00000136"/> 266       L E A NDER f B HALL. "Yes, I think that's the calculation, if Bro. Taylor comes down." ,' I hope he will come then," and Miss Matilda whirled out of the,door, after giving a downright "curchee," aim- ed for a splendid French bend. She was to have another talk with Bro. Sumner now. Oh what a delightful task! Vishnu, the chief deity of the Trimurti, never had such a nectared cup before his lips, though all the gods might have contributed thereto. No wonder she tossed her chesnut ringlets, with so much assumed grace, as she tinkled her "keeler boots" on the pavement, hurrying homeward. She pursued her way rapidly, and so intent was,she on the task before her, that she rubbed against a haber-dasher, and sent part of his wares overboard, with destructive velocity. She did not stop to apologize. No; he was nothing but a peddler, so Miss Matilda had no notion of such condescension. But how was she to see Mr. Sumner? In a case like this, she deemed her business sufficient excuse to send for him, so she did not hesitate-to drop a sweet scented billet- deux in the post office that evening, as a summons. He would get it before night, as the mail always came in just before sun-set, and Mr. Sumner would be sure to go to the office. She began, before dusk, to make preparations for his reception. The lamp in the parlor was arranged so as the light would fall on her in a becoming reflection. Chairs, sofas, and divans, placed to suit her, she then sought -her room (mirror) to arrange those '"ecreant curls," (disobedient, no doubt, because she had not been their trainer in their growth,) and to put a little chalk on her face, "because she had been in the wind." Miss Lankinston was not disappointed on this occasion. Mr. Sumner, thinking that something importapt was on hand, hurried down to see her, after early tea. She had not been able to divine the cause of Mr. Tay- lor's visit to M-- on the previous week, so she was not conscious of the: bogus reconciliation of Annie Bacon. Had she known these facts, (or Mr. Sumner's impressions rather) perhaps she would not have evinced'so much zeal in the cause. Miss Matilda sat almost buried in the soft cushion of a divan, while her feet rested on a cluster of roses covering   THE INVESTIGATION'.       267 an ottoman. There was as much grace about her attitude as was possible for her to assume. She also held a book in her hand, deeply engaged in its pages; but the gentle knock of the young preacher' did not fail to attract her attention. "Is that you, Bro. Sumner? Come in. Have this chair, it is more comfortable than the rest. How is your health?" "Very good, I thank you. But am I not depriving you by taking this chair? "Oh o, not at all I prefer a seat here." She did not broach the subject until late. Mr. Sum ler demurred a while, for his conscience did not approve of it. At length the thought struck him that Mr. Taylor would be at M-- on the next Sabbath evening, and he could administer the ordinance. Also he remembered that he had promised to preach out in the country that evening late, so he could not possibly get to M--- that night. He was glad of this. "Why do you hesitate?" asked Miss Tankinston, fear- ing that he would oppose it. "  "I was only thinking. Bro. Taylor will be here. He will do as well as me." "But why not you?" "I will not be in M-- n next Sabbath. I have an appointnient in the country, which I allowed to be made when I found out that Bro. Taylor could fill the one here." "Will he be willing, under the circumstances?-that is, you know it's a little violation of our rules-will he consent to it?" "I presume he will. Such has been done, and I think it is of no very unfrequent occurrence. At least I've known it to have been done several times." So it was arranged that Mrs. Dr. Moore's children should be baptized into the Methodist Church on the coming Sabbath evening, regardless of the plea of infant baptism, viz: "Parents' faith." By this act, every body would recognize Mrs. Moore as sidingt with the Methodists. How the Baptists would grieve! It was conjectured that they were counting on Dr. Moore and his wifg, but now the " fat would be in the fire," in the future life of such a hope. The Scribes and the Pharisees, the Sadceees, and the Ebionites, even  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC8270-00000137"/> 268       LEANDER HALL. all the anti-Christs of ancient days, would not presume on such an act in Christ's Church as was in contemplation by the parties just mentioned! If this was only an imagination of the writer, it might be passed over, but since it is a real event of the past, methinks we would be justifiable in laying down our pen, and standing aghast at the enormi- ty of the sin, perpetrated in a country, where the Bible is untrammeled!  But to pass on. Mr: Sumner had not found time during the whole week, or since the day after Mr. Taylor left, to call on Annie, his time had been so employed in the investigation. You remember, reader, how he took her endeavors of expos- tulation on that evening; how he left with the impression that all was right. This had been his hope through the whole time of his adversity. Indeed it had been a sup- port. Once he resolved to spend the evening with her, but as he thought that everything was going well, he concluded to spend his time in study, for he had found thatan ex- temporaneous defense was not altogether to be relied on. He was somewhat consoled by the Sisters' sympathy. His only wish now was the finishing of affairs. He knew he had failed to give close communion a death blow, but he mollified his disappointments by the fact of his being so well sustained by his Church members. All to a man except Mr. Semms had come up personally and expressed their regrets, in conjunction with vehement avowals of undying support., Well, we all know that it is natural to cling to some hope, so no one can blame our hero in ac- cepting this the last comfort, and yet of the two we would choose the Bible. Mr. Bacon at heart wished Mr. Semms, and Mr. Weston, a thousand miles away from M-- . No doubt, had he had it in his power, his wish would have been realized. He was so provoked with the former, for the last remarks he had made, that he would scarcely deign to speak to 'him, in a respectable tone.           . We may already judge that Mr. Semmswas an honest, just, upright, and conscientious man, who, for the ebul- liency of those principles was termed by our worthy host a , heretic, and worse than the Baptists." But all such epithets were lost on him, as he took no cognizance of   THE INVESTIGATION.        269 any unusual ebullitions, as he was so engrossed with the theme before him. We must leave Mr. Semms now, and follow the further developments of affairs. CHAPTER XXI. THE AOE OF THE METHODIST CHURCH. ITS POPISH ORIGEN, AND ITS HERARCHAL NATURE; "Call no man your Father upon earth, Jor one is your father uwho is in heaven-Neither be ye called masters for one is your master, even Christ."--Math. xxiii. 9, 10. MR. SUMNER went home from Miss Lankinston's house  that night, and began a close perusal of the Methodist Discipline. He read, and re-read, but could not see why Mr. Weston wanted to dispute, such wholesome doctrine. The finger of the immortal Wesley was traced through- out its pages. Was it possible for such a great and good man to err? There is but one infallible guide in Chris- tendom, to be recognized by man, and that is the Bible! but Mr. Sumner was oblivious of this fact. Let men plan forms of government as often as they will, and as many kinds as they please, but all, all will crumble in the dust, but the one laid down in the Sacred Oracles. Mr. Sum- ner forgot this in his fascination with Methodism. But we will not anticipate. "Your Church has already been found lacking in two very important principles, Mr. Sumner," said Mr. Weston, as they gathered around the table the next morning to pursue the investigation. "But to give you a good  chance," he continued, "we will not suppose them a nulli- fying process unless other inconsistencies come up." "thought we had disposed of all the points at issue, Mr. Weston," interrupted the young preacher. !S  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC8270-00000138"/> 870      LEAtD ER HALL. "Not at all. Your Discipline is your acknowledged book of creeds, so we must look into it." "I am perfectly willing for it to undergo an examina- tion, for I have such great confidence in the ability and goodness of its planners that I apprehend no danger." "Let the authors be as perfect and upright as they may be, or may have been; that cannot establish the ortho- doxy of the doctrine inculcated therein. The Bible, you know, is to be our only guide." "Well, I must say, Mr. Weston, you Baptists are the most ultra in sentiment, of any people I ever saw, and the greatest sticklers for Bible othodoxy of-minor matters that can be found in this round world. Now all this is foolishness. Such a theory prohibits the possibility of any improvement, on rules laid down for men who could not, under the circumstances, form such unexceptionable doctrine, as men of latter days of enlightenment and learning." "I hope you do not mean to insinuate, Mr. Sumner, that the Church government of the Bible is susceptible of being improved by man, do you?!" "Why not?" "Because such a doctrine would be a presumption on God's competency. Rest assured sir, Balvin's, Baxter's, Stuart's, and even Wesley's revisions, all put together, could not add one iota of perfection to the government of the Church as laid down in the Bible. Sir, Christ left his Church complete, and through the mouths of his Apostles, he brought to mind by the Holy Spirit, every principle inculcated by himself, during his. peregrinations on earth. All the ingenuity of man combined cannot make the rules thereof any more perfect."' "Yet, that does not prove, Mr. Weston, that the Meth- odist Discipline is unauthenticated by the Bible. We all know that John Wesley was a Bible reader, and a man of strict principles enough to have repudiated any un- scriptural doctrine that might have been introduced. The Discipline, we learn, was published under his direction, hence I am satisfied with its correctness." "As you acknowledge him your founder?" "Yes, the founder of the Methodist Church." "That must be kept in view. Now for the principles taught therein. But we will begin with the Church fst.   THE INVESTIGAT-ION   .    271 The Discipline will be brought in occasionally, as needed.  We have examined the Church on two points and found it lacking; enough to prove that the Methodist Church is not the true- (hurch, yet we must go farther. You mustadmit, Mr. Sumner, that the Church of Christ was set up, over eighteen hundred years ago." . "- c Yes sir." "And that Christ said 'upon this rock, I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it,' which proves that there must have been a perpetuation of his Church throughout the dark ages of the world, for the gates of hell were not to prevail against it. Now, sir, unless the genealogy of your Church can be traced back  to the Apostolic days, you have no claims to the Church o' Christ, or you falsify his declaration! You must now answer for yourself. When was such an organization first manifest?".  "You know without asking," replied Mr. Sumner, gruffly, and turning in his chair uneasily.  "But that is not the thing. You must answer for your Church and give it all the defense you can. Please an-  swer for your own benefit. Again I ask, at what period, was your Society first visible?" "In seventeen and twenty-nine Anno Domini, John Wesley, first conceived the idea of such a Society. I shall answer no more. If you want it done you must do it yourself."  "Then I will. You may take the privilege of refuting  anything I say. I will, carry on a dialogue now between the Church and Methodism. "Church.-' Did you ever hear or read in your history of any others by your name, class, or order, previous to 1729?' "Methodism.--' I have never heard of any of my name, but I sprang from, a large family, the Church of Eng-  land, who we all know, sprang from the Holy Catholic  Church of Rome! '  "Church.- Then you are the legitimate grand-daugh-  ter of the Church of Rome?'  "M ethodism.-' Yes, my lineage is thus established by the most satisfactory and irrefragable proofs. My grand mrother is a Scriptural Church undoubtedly, since she is referred to in the Bible! (See Rev. xviii.) So if she was ' for                 .  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC8270-00000139"/> -272 .  -  L- -'ANDER HALL'. a legitimate wife, her daughter, the Church of England, must have been a legitimate child, of which I ama daughlter.' " 4"That is unjust, Mr. West6n. You 'know we abhor the Roman Catholic Church as much as you do." "And a legitimate descendant too!! You cannot deny, but that John Wesley was of the Church of Eng- land! You know the Church of England sprang from the Roman Church, then why do you hate. the Roman Catholics so? You still maintain their doctrine in part, which I have already proven, and which has no claims on the Bible."  Mr. Sumner said nothing, but cast a nervous look " around at the listeners, to note the effect of Mr. Weston's speech.' "The Methodist Church," continued Mr. Weston, "is not the Church of Christ, according to its own history, because it lacks over 1700 years of being old enough. It being conceived-in 1729, and born in 1789, christened by its present name in America in 1784, beiig only 135 years of age? - "Instead of being of the descent of the martyred 'sains,' or of the witnesses of the ' primitive truth,' it is of the reverse in features and descent. I would ask you a few questiois here, Mr. Sumner, which you cannot re- fuse to answer, unless you 'declare that you will have nothing more to do with this investigation." "Ask as many as you wish," was the reluctant grant. "Thank you, Mr. Sumner;, for your kindness. Now for the questions. As I have given the birth and age of the Methodist Church, tell me, from whence it sprang?" "We all know, Mr. Weston, that it was reformed from the Episcopal Church:- so we are told by one of its great founders-John -Wesley." "Very well, Mr. Sumner; now tell me from whence sprang the Episcopal Church?" "It was a reformation from the Roman C. Church." "That's all true. Now is not the Roman Catholic Church termed by all Protpstants, the 'MOTHER OF HAR- "OTS'? or ' MYSTIC BABYON'? or the WOMAN IN SCARLET'? Are not these epithets applied to her?"  "Certainly, Mr. Weston, we all think that the woman arrayed in scarlet and pui-ple, is the Roman Catholic        '  '- .   .'   TH I!NVBSTIGATIoN.       278 Church, in pontifical garb, and dyed in the blood of saints." 4"And still you acknowledge your Church as a re-refor- mation from her!!"  Mr. Sumner was speechless. "Instead of being the Church of Christ,"' continued Mr. Weston, " you are the grand-daughter of the 'Mother of Harlots,' and closely resemble her in many features! Am I to blame for not communing with you? "That there was a Church before Christ's ascention, and that it was a people 'called out,' I have proven; but- it matters not whether it was set up in Adam's, Noah's, or Abraham's family, for it cann9t be the Methodist Church, since it is too youthful, and since there was no manifesto of any such occurrence in ancient days. There was no proclamation of its coming in the days of mira- cles: only the mystic family of Babylon; that was the only new religion prophiesied of, so, unless Methodism be- longs there, it has no claims whatever in the sacred Ora- cles. "In the 18th chapter of Rev., a woman arrayed in pur- ple and scarlet, is described---a Church in .kingly, and bloody apparel. This woman, M-r. Sunlner, you say, is the Roman Catholic Church. We are told that this wo- man was drunken with the blood of saints, and with the mar- tyrs of Jesus, whoever those saints were, tley could not have been of the Methodist Church, that's one thing cer- tain, for it has never shed one drop of blood, from the power of the Roman Catholic Church, since its birth. But Baptists have been made to crimsoned rivers, by her per- secutions." "The woman arrayed in scarlet and purple, is denomi- nated the 'MOTHER OF HARLOTS, and ABOMNATION OF THE EARTH!' now, I would ask you, who are her daughters? Who but the various sects of Pedo-baptists? The Lu- theran,thePresbyterian, and the Episcopal,areall branches ornatural off-shoots of the Roman Catholic Church, and Methodism was a reform, or natural daughter of one of these, then are we not compelled to term the Churches those harlots, of which we were just speaking?" "You are very unjust, Mr. Weston, to hold us up in that lioht, for you know we hate the Roman Catholic Quarch, just as much as you do," interrupted Mr. Sum-  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC8270-00000140"/> 274       LEANDE R HALL. ner, somewhat ruffled by the application, which he knew would be impossible to remove. lThen why do you retain hter features? and why still remain of that descent?" "Can we help our parentage?" he asked reproachfully, and almost sadly. You could disclaim fellowship with those that cing to popish doctrine; and seek fellowship in the Church of- God!  , "But to proceed: Who has helped the Roman Catho- lics to spill the blood of saints? It was not the Baptists, for history gives them a record clear from bloHd! You cannot say this much of Pedo-baptists; ifyou do, I would ask you to go back to ;the early history of our Church, and even on America's shores, we find your ac- count book crimsoned with blood, and blackened with persecution!! Then as you are a legitimate descenidant of the Roman Catholic Church, and since you embrace the doctrine from whose altar, tyranny and persecution have ever issued, how can .you clear yourself of this charge? Are Pedo-baptists clear of blood? ' Say Mr. Sumner, are they?" "I know Mr. Weston," said Mr. Sumner, "that in the early history of our country and even before, some Pedo- baptists did persecute the Baptists and other heretics, by committing excesses, such as putting a few to death, and imprisoning some, but this was dene in misguided zeal, so. now when there is peace and amity amongst qs, it should be forgotten.". "And you term the Baptists ' heretics,' Mr. Sumner?" exclaimed Mr. Weston. " our acknowledgemeit of my previous statement, proves that you belong to that order, which had drunk the blood of these 'heretics' for ages, then am I wrong in calling you a harlet,' or daughter of mystic Babylon? And with these facts before me, can you expect mre to commune with you? "Again: 'I saw under the altar, the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held; and they cried with a loud voice say- ing, How long, O Lod, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on earth?

Whoever these martyrs were, one thing is  sure, they were not Metho- dists, for they have never lost one drop of blood for their cause, having the convenient fortification of Apostasy to  fall back on, in the event of persecution. When and where has a Methodist been martyredfor the perseverance ill his faith? Or is it probable that any would do it when they have this contingent breast-works to cover with? Then I affirm here again, that you are not the Church of Christ. Rather than that, you are in the lineal  descent of those, the Catholics, the Lutherans, the Pres- byterians, the Episcopalians, who have united to persecute the persecuted Baptists!! If you do not believe me, go read history, and the rivers of human gore spilt by your kinsmen, will attest of this assertion. And I am scorned derided, nicknamed by every species of epithetic mocke- ry, because I refuse to commune with such! Time may plaster over these things, but IJam told by inspiration to 'AVOID' you, and so I ever will, as long as our Land- marks are discernable, and as long as you teach false doc- trine!" Mr. Sumner looked too much discomfited to be imag- ined or portrayed by the writer. He did not know of aiy appropriate reply to make, for he felt the truth, and could not override that conviction, so he remained mum. Mr. Weston continued. "That Christ left hi's Church complete in rules, and regulations, no one can doubt. This would even be con- ceded by every learned man-of your ranks. He taught his disciples what was necessary for them to know, and he gave them the promise of the Holy Spirit to bring to mind what he had told them. If the Apostles after him, did not dare set up a Church of different rules and regu- lations, can it be presumed on by men uninspired?  have-as much right to set up a Church as John Wesley,  and so have you! That the Church government of  Christ's Church, is purely of divine origin, you will ad- mit, Mr. Sumner." "Certainly," was the very weak response.  "Then I ask you candidly, if Methodism is of divine origin?" ' "The founders might have been inspired. We are v L  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8270-00000141"/> 276       LEANDER HALL. told that John Wesley was a pious and righteous man, addicted to the cause wholly." "Yet you will acknowledge that he was not convert. ed for ten years after the setting up of that society! INSPIRED!!-and unconverted!!  Hie set up Meth- odism while 'in the gall of bitterness and in the'bond of iniquity,' and you claim it to be of divine origin! We have this from his own writings, his own avowal." Mr. Sumner had certainly forgotten himself. Men un- regenerated to devise a divine model!! "[But enough of this,"' continued Mr. Weston, after a moment of silence. "W e findthat the Church of Christ was set up in the days of the Cfesars, and Methodism in the days of George III. The Church of Christ is of divine origin, and Methodism of human. The last charge of our Saviour to his disciples, was: 'Teaching theim to observe all things whatsoever I HAVE COMMANDED you;' a specific law, prohibiting them from teaching any thing else. This, you must acknowledge, by all rules of government, is a legitimate construction, and undeniable logic. John Wesley did not pretend to teach the doc- trine of the Bible, according to his own confession, there- fore the Methodist Church is no 'more the Church of Christ than masonry; hence I cannot recogniie it as its equal, nor can I fellowship it." "But you don't fellowship any of the Churches, what is vour excuse for that? ' asked Dr. Boon who had been all the while a silent listener. "I will attend to that point in time Doctor. Yet for your present satisfaction, I will say that there is but one Church, and that Church has no right to be taking into its bosom all sects and classes, by Church affiliation, be- cause they wish it. What was the origin and design of Methodism? Not to build up the cause of Christ cer- tainly, or its founder does not speak correctly. Hear him  '"In November, 1729, at which time I came to reside at Oxford, my brother and I, and two young gentlemen more, agreed tospend three&amp; or flur evenings in a week together. On Sunday evening we read something in di- vinity, on other nights the Greek and Latin classics!' "This is from Mr. Wesley himself, Their design was to study classics Not to read the Bible, not to 'pray,   THE INVESTIGATION.       2" not to sing, but to study classics!! This is the Methodist  Church!-a Christian Church!! Here   ' is, without  either iltar or'divinity, its members and pieachers, ac- cording to their own statement, all unconverted! Hear  Mr. Wesley's own testimony, long after the establishment  of his society. He meets with a pious Moravian, and is  convicted.  "'This then I have learned in the end of the earth-  that I am fallen short of the glory of God; that my whole heart is altogether corrupt and abominable. (The founder of a Christian (!) Church!) I am a child of wrath, an heir of hell. I left my native country in order to teach the Georgian Indians the nature of Christianity; but what have I learned myself the meantime? Why,  (what I the least of all suspected,) that I, who went to i America to convert others, WAS NEVER MYSELF CONVERTED - TO GOD.'* *Wesley's Works, vol. iii: p. 53. Vol. iii: p. 74. "The head of a Church!! But now of his conversion. Shortly after writing this, he had evidence of passing from death unto life. He says 'In the evening I went unwillingly to a Society in Aldersgate street, where one was reading Luther's preface to the epistle to the Ro- mans. About a quarter before nine, while he was de-   - scribing the change which God works in the heart, through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ alone for salvation; and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins,  i even mine, and stved me from the law of sin and death.'  "Thus front Mr. Wesley's own lips we have the deela-  ration that the Mpthodist society was set up by uncon- verted men. God never commanded angels to set up a Church, much less men, and unconverted too!  We are told in the Good 'Book that all sinners are the Devil's children, who do the,'lusts' of the devil. (See John viii: 44.) Methodism is the Work and device of un- godly men. What better can it claim than the above- te 'lusts' or behests of the devil? Can any human in- vention claim better, which is of the unregenerated? Let Methodists who have been 'born again, consider this. Consider that you are giving your aid and influence to a society set up by unconverted men, in rivalship of the; Church of Christ!! How do you reconcile this ques-  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC8270-00000142"/> 278      LEANDER  HALL. tion: 'Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?' How reconcile to yourself this: 'If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow ME?' I could throw myself on my knees before every Methodist, and plead this, if I thought it would do any good, but 'blind- ness in part is happened unto them,' then why expend time-in trying to disclaim them of their ancestral birth -the daughter of the 'Mother of harlots and abomina- tions of the earth'? Is joining Mr. Wesley's society de- nying yourself and following Christ? Are the rules and regulations of the Methodist Church, devised by unre- generated and unconverted men, in accordance with those of the Bible? I ask you Mr. Sumner, to reflect on this. Remember that you have joined yourself to a society, set up in opposition to Christ's Church, and you are prefer- ring it over his Church!" "But sir, we claim to be a branch of Christ's Church," pleaded Mr. Sumner,. whose countenance had now be- come livid. ' You profess to be a branch of Christ's Church!-a human invention of unconverted men!--a branch of Christ's Church!! Upon what grounds can you boast of such an assumption? The bible supports no such doc- trine. "You contend for the one and the same Church both dispensations, and now preach up the branch sys- tem! What inconsistency! 'You do not, nor does any one believe that Christ established a plurality of Churches. And yet in the face of the most glaring incon- sistencies, you still cling to the almost superanuated theory of branches of the Church! Well I cannot blame you as it is your only hope." Mr. 'Sumner said no moie. But determined in the future to be silent about the branch system. We don't blame him. Mr. Bacon had been caught up on that once, and in consequence of this reminiscence, together with other facts, he was becoming very restless. He certainly had gotten hold of the wrong chair. I hope there was not a pin in it, though he gave unmistakable evidences of such a thing. Wr. Weston proceeded.  "We have found that Methodism is not necessarily a Christian Society, for it is accustomed even to this day,   THE I VESTIGAT ION      .  279 to take in unconverted men, of which it was composed at first. The class meeting system was suggested by a man  - of the world, Captain Fay, for secular purposes. Says a writer: ' Mr. Wesley met the chief of the society in Bris- tol, and-inquired, 'How shall we pay the debt upon the preaching house?' Captain Fay stood up and said: 'Let every one in the society give a penny a week, and it will be easily done.' 'But many of them' said one, 'have not a penny to give.' 'True,' said the Captain, 'then put ten or twelve of them to me. Let each of these giv6  what they can weekly, and I will supply what is want- ing.' Many others made the same offer, so Mr. Wesley divided the societies among them, assigning a class of about twelve persons to each of these, who were termed  leaders.'-Wesley's Works, vol. vii: p 316. "Think of it Mr. Sumner! one of your 'vital' institu- tions, devised by human beings for mercenary motives only, and is the 'one which excludes you, no matter how pious you are, if vou do not come up to its requisitions. Something purely democratic (!) and of divine origin!! But to proceed. "There was another duty enjoined on -these leaders. 'Not long after, (the appointment of leaders) one of these informed Mr. Wesley that, calling on such a one in his house, he found him quarreling with his wife-anoth-  er was found in drink. It immediately struck Mr. Wesley's mind, 'This is the very thing we wanted; the leaders are the persons who may not only receive the contributions, but also watch over the souls of their breth- ren.' The society in London being informed of this willingly followed the example of that in Bristol, as did every society from that time, whether in Europe or America.'--Vol. vii: p 316. "You have the plan before you. What is the office of the Class leader? Allow me to answer for you. To watch- the people and collect funds-for mercenary. purposes, and very much resembles the office of inquisitors, Whose duty it is to inform upon their brethren to the general of their order. Such is the. character of the leaders of the Church of Rome. Has Christ's Church any such  rules?

They claimed to be only soceties previously. Ord, inances of the Church were unknown. What better right had they at that period to claim to be a Church, than at first? From whence came their ordinances? Rome! From what authority were their preachers or- dained? RRome! Then should you be ashamed of your great ancestors? I trow not." "You are really unfieling and censorious, Mr. Weston, in your remarks. You misrepresent the thing entirely," said Mr. Sumner reproachfully. "Then you must correct me. I am giving factsas given me by your own men, and drawing but natural conclu- sions."        / Mr. Sumner made no reply, so Mr. Weston went on. "We are told by Mr. Wesley himself, in speaking of his Society, that it was not democratic. 'We are no re- publicans, and never intend to be.' Every minister or member, the moment he enters the Society, surrenders all freedom! He is the subject of the bishops and lead- ers! Noow we do not object to being subjects of Christ's Church, and servants of his rules, nor have we any right to be otherwise if we claim membership in his Church; but since Mr. Wesley, Coke, Asbury, and others, never for once pretended to have consulted the Bible in their scheme, we do indeed feel a strong repugnance to being a slave to their rules and devices, and ordinances of Popish descent! From whence came yourEpiscopacy, Mr. Sumner? and what is the difference between the vow the Discipline requires, and that the Pope requires? Al- low me here to give a Methodist elder's oath. I know you are acquainted with it, Mr. Sumner, but for the ben- Cfit of others present, I will read it. Please hand me the Discipline." Mr. Sumner did as he was required, but with great ap- prehension. Mr. Weston read: "Bishop.--' And now that this present congregation of Christ here assembled, may also understand your minds and wills in these things, and this your promise may the more move you to do your duties, ye shall answer plainly to these things which we, IN THE NAME OF GOD and his Church, shall demand of you touching the same. "Bishop.-' Will you REVERENTLY   OBEY your CHEF ML1uIaaRS, unto whom is committed the charge and   THB INVESTIGATION.        281 government over you; following with a glad mind and will, THEIR godly admonitions, submitting yourself to their GODLY JUDGMENTS?' "Answer.-' I will do so, the Lord bcing my helper.' "To this oath, sir, your elders subscribe, promising obedience to MEN!! "When our Saviour told his disciples that there was no law-giver but himself, no master but himself, can any one recognize the above as being a component part of the Church of Christ? That men should set themselves up to be lords over the Church, is a sacrilege beyond concep- tion. At whose door must such episcopacy be laid? Whence its origin?  Rome! Rome!! Rome!!!   The Roman Clurch-,-the woman in scarlet and purple--THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMNATIONS OF THE EARTH!! You claim to be the Church'of Christ. What? can the Church of Christ be clothed in the garb of the ' nother of harlots,' and be a perfect model of Divine origin? Sir, unless you can take up your government-the ordinances, the pedigree of your Church-and defend them with Bible testimony, the above sink of iniquity is your legitimate place! This you know you cannot do. All the inventive genius of Wesley, Coke, Asbury, Clark, Benson, White- field, or any others, who might with gigantic intellect take hold of this, could not do it!! I defy any man to try. Thousands have made the effort and failed; few will ever try it again. History has been distorted, the sacred Oracles have been clothed in false religion andbase interpretation,. but the scheme has failed, with only an echo lingering. Where! Where!! Where!!! Soon the reverberation will die out entirely, and you will be left on the footing which is justly yours-no foundation but human inventive genius, as Satan the instigator! for: ' Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.'" "You certainly do not-no, you cannot mean, Mr. Wes- ton, that the Methodist Church is of the devil! That is an outhreak on prudence!" exclaimed Mr. Sumner, in high excitement. "Don't become so excited, Mr. Sumner. Take it more calmly. You are not to blame for it, although you are to blame for setting it up, by your influence, above the ChJurch of Christ. You know it was invented and set up by men unregenerated, who we are told by Christ are 24  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC8270-00000144"/> 282       LF ANDI R HALL. the children of the devil. Now what is not sacred, is pro- fane. There is no middle ground between these. Can anything sacred originate with profane and unregenera- ted men? I leave it for your good sense and candor to decide. I say again, that the Methodist Church is not of sacred or Divine origin. I say, and you have admitted, in company with all, your great men, that the Church of Christ is of Divine and sacred origin. Now your prefer- ring the former, does it not look like you are trying to rival the Church of God? Are you not virtually de- claring that you prefer Wesley's laws over Christ's? Where are any of Wesley's laws, that accord with the Bible? Did lie ever give the Bible as his plea for any of his regoulations? No! No! You know he never did!" "I think you are really tyrannical in your expressions, Mr. Weston. One would suppose, from what you sayj that we are all the children and followers of the devil," said Mr. Sumner, in no pleasant tone. "You misapprehend me, sir. I say you are the follow- ers )f that government, which was set up through his (the devil's) instrumentality, in opposition to that set up by Christ; but I hope you do it blindly. Your doing this unconsciously, relieves the necessity of your being the devil's children. You are regenerated followers'of the scheme devised by unregenerated men. Any one know- ing this, and feeling the proper importance, it makes no difference who he is, if he loves Christ, he will turn away from this ungodly device. But there are many cold and lukewarmn hearts, influenced by prejudices, and policy, who know their duty and yet neglect it; for such 1 trem- ble. But to proceed: "Why do you vow to serve your elders? Why do you vow to keep the rules of the Discipline? They are an- tagonistic to the Bible, and any one who takes the oath jut read, vows to obey the Discipline, to the exclusion of the Bible; if not, he is excluded. You may preach as much as you please, nonessentials of the Bible, but you know, sir, that yolf dare not mention nonessentials of the Discipline!! What is this but clerical despotism, under popes, bishops, priests, prelates and leaders?!! Though you claim no leader or ruler by the name of pope, yet what is your higher or3er of bishops less? 'Thou shalt wor- ship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve,' rings out against your Episcopal tyranny.   THE INVESTIGATION.        ZO. I would not kneel to men, like you do to your bish- ops, and swear to obey them, for all the gold and honors i cllristendom.  I would suffer my body to be racked with torture, until this heart ceased to tlirob, first. Much less would I swear to serve you before Christ. When 1 reflect on this, I tremble. Could 1 suffer, I, poor frail mortal of the dust, could I suffer my fellow-man to bow to nme and swear-REVERENTLY TO OBEY me! No. 'See thou do it not; I am thy fellow-servant, and of tly breth- ren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God!' (Rev. xix: 10,) I would exclaim to my last breath. ' But to the Discipline;-the ordeal through which you hove been, Mr. Sumner. "' Do you know the rules of the Society-of the bands? Do you keep them? (never mind the, Bible!) Have you read the form of Discipline? (not the Bible!) Are you Iwillinq to conform to them? (not the Bible!) Iave you considered the rules of a preacher, especially the 1st, 10th, and 12th? Will you keep them for conscience sake'? "Now sir, to tlese you answered in the affirmative; then what was presented to you? A Methodist Disci- pline by which you are to be governed, instead of the Bible! and this commission: 'As long as you freely con- sent to, and earllestly endeavor to .walk by these rules, (not of the Bible, but of the Discipline.) we shall rejoice to acknowledge you as a fellow-laborer.' Not one word said about the commandments of Christ, but a strict in.- junction to obey a scheme, which, 'Of course, like all oth- or IIUMAN INSTITUTIONS, HAS ITS DEFECTS AND IMPERFECTIONS.' (Inskip, p. 65.) "But what were the 1st, 10th and 12th rules? "1st, 'To preach.' "10th, 'Be punctual. Do everything exactly at the time, (very good.) And do not mend our rules, but kcep them"!!

"You know Mr. Weston that we do not consider them Christians. That is our reason." "Yon commune with the Reformers, don't you " "Yes, they are liberal enough to ask us, so we do not refuse," said the young preacher, aiming a reproof. "But, if I am right, I have often heard your'preacher say, and I believe it. is a general impression among you, that the?Campbellites have no religion;' therefore are not Christians. Do you consider baptism essential to salvation?" "No sir, we do not."' 'Do you believe that those who are baptized for the remission of Fins, are regenerated?" "No, no, there is' nothing that can pay the awful debt   TH; ZNVISTTIG&amp;TrON.       285 of man, but Christ's blood, applied by the Holy Ghost." "'Now I understand you. Then you do not, nor can you with any consistency, consider Campbellites Chris- tians."  Mr. Sumner saw the application, and hastened to rec- tify his mistake. "Oh sir we think, and hope that some of the Reform- ers are regenerated." "And so you might of the Catholics. The latter pre- sent as strong a plea as the former. You refuse to cornm- mune with the Catholics; why? They are more like you in forim of government than the Campbellites. You say the Canpbbllites have no rightful claims to the name of Christian; the same you say about the Roman Catholics.  Now, you commune with the former, and believe at the time that they are unregenerated, and your principles are as adverse to each other, as the distance is great, from the north to the south, while to the latter, you bear a strong resemblance, in Church'government, and the same in ordi- nances, also another still greater tie-you are of its, (the Roman Catholic Church) race-a descendant from that motherhood. Where is the consistency? This is one of the'features of open communioln., Its liniaments are - marked throughout with such gross distortions." "But, sir you know the Refoi'mers profess to be Chris-  tians."' "And so do the Catholics. We have as much right to judge one as the other. If you commune with ,Camp- bellites, you are as much obligated to commune with the Catholics to carry out your theory of open communion." "Well, we all don't think alike about these&amp; things. Every man to his notion," said Mr. Sumner trying to smoothe over things.  "You are not thus privileged according to your Disci-  pline, and you violate a vow in saying that you are. You have no right to any notion, or at least, the expression of it, if it is contrary to the Discipline. But to the sulbject:  Let me finish the application, and we will close. You refuse to commune with the Catholic because of his prin- ciples, can you blame me for not affilliating with you, when you are so much, yes when you as a natural inhre- itance, have nearly all the pernicious rules and ordinan- ces, which originated with the Roman Church?

The Churches are distinguished by their rules and ordinances, and so must Church affiliation. But I am taking up too much time. We will take up this subject in our next meeting. The time allotted has expired, half an hour ago, so we will close for the present, unless you wish to make some winding-up remarks. Have you anything to say?" "Nothing at all. i might say a great deal, but you would take it upon yourself to make it ridiculous," he answered, with some degree of petulency. "Pardon me, but i must say, it is not my custom to deal in carricatures. And if I have said anything which might be doubted, I beg you all, to read the Methodist Discipline, and no farther testimony will be needed. Al- so, read the history of the Methodist Church, its rules and regulations, as well as itsself, will be traced to the MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMNATIONS OF THE EARTH, the woman drunken with the blood of saints, which even Methodists say, is the Catholic Church! You can not trace Meth- odism anywhere else, neither do its features resemble any origin but Pagan Rome! In short, the Church is a re-reform from Rome! the same ol4 Romish missals be- ing retained, only remodled."   CHAPTER XXII. THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED, IN WHCH IT IS MORE CLEARLY SHOWN THAT THE METHODIST CHURCH IS A LEGITIMATE DE SCENDANT OF THE WOMAN,  "Arrayed in purple (Iheirarchy)-and Scarlet Color, and decked with gold and precious Stones and Pearls--And upon her forehead was a name written, M YSTER Y, BABY- "ON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS (false Churches) AND ABOMNATIONS (false doc- trine,) OF THE EARTH!"---Rev. xvii. 4. 5. ONE word to the reader and the narrative shall go on. This subject is not taken up under such auspices, merely for the sake of argument, but we leave the investigation with any unbiased mind, and our delineation will be found to be true. We appeal to history and the Bible for better claims for the Methodist Church, but alike, both pointto the Gates of Babylon, from whence are gush- ing hosts of "Harlots," claiming to be true Churches, together with many abominations.'  The next morning the company met again, for the pur- pose of prosecuting thismomentous subject. Mr. Sum- ner was so much shaken in the faith, that he made but few pretensions to defense. Being a man of some con- scientious scruples, he could not struggle against convio- tion, so his prayers now, were for a speedy termination, for we can assure the reader there was no music to his ear, in Mr. Weston's sayings, who immediately began the subject after all were assembled and quieted. "We are told that the Roman Catholics claim a suc-  cession of popes from Pope Peter, to Pope Pio Nono,-the  present pontiff.' What less do the.  Methodists claim? Let us see. You hold and teach, that the 'keys of the kingdom of heaven.' were committed alone to the Methodist Clergy--that you, the Clergy, can open and close-the doors of the Church at your will. Am I right in this, Mr. Sumner?"  i  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC8270-00000147"/> 288       LEANDER  HALL. "Yes, sir, I believe it is a right of the clergyto receive members or to exclude members at their will, but you know the clergy are, or ought to be a pious people, there- fore will not do anything but whatis proper and expe- dient. "I don't know any such a thing, nor do you, Mr. Sum- ner. ' Give a man an inch and he will take an ell." Give your clergy power to exclude, or take in the Church such as they judge proper, and the strangeritinerant may-take in the most consummate villian in the State--an infidel who has n   no ore otionof 'fleeing the wrath to come,' than a brute, or he may exclude one of the best members, who, perhaps, does not please hin in some little trifflings which he could construe as violations of :the Discipline, though the Bible made no such requisitions. This is muchl like making a Pope over each community, and all collectively under the great Pope, or the BishoIi, as you call him. In- deed so many masters are enough to confuse any institu- tion in the woild. If it were not for the perfect control you have over the laity, your system would fall, in the midst of anarchy, incident to its nature. Now, I have been to your meetings, and lhave seen you receive into the Church individuals, without consulting the Church- the proper medium-any more than if it were a mere mass of spectators. What right have you to do this? It is hierar- chal, but Christiapity is democratic in its nature, as far as the ruling power of the Church goes. We are told by inspiration, that we should recognize no master on earth in the Church. You do not profess to follow this injunc- tion, but rather suffer yourselves to be placed above the laity, while you still look to a higher authority, which almost virtually claims vicegerency. But this is leaving the original subject. You like the Catholics, virtually con- tend for a succession of bishops from Peter, to whom you say, Christ gave the keys of both kingdoms. I know there are diversified opinions about that passage, but let it mean what it may, he (Christ) spoke of no successor to Peter. We find in sacred history, that the other Apostles exer- cised as much right as Peter did, and, some, better judg- ment. Now for the clergy to clain the power which the Apostles had, is a vain conception indeed. If you claim the power of government, then you must that of dicta- ting. If you clwaim tho right of dictating, you must also  E                        I   THE INVESTIGATION.        289 claim the gift of inspiration, for the Apostles spoke by inspiration. 'All Scripture is given by inspiration!' You know you do not claim to be inspired, therefore you have no right to dictate, or to rule. Neither were the founder of your scheme an inspired man. Nor did the Apostles rule; ugh tho ey were, inspired. Who was to deal with an offending brother, if he relented not? The Church. Who excluded the incestuous brother at Co- rinth for his sin? The Church. Who were praised for trying 'them who say they are Apostles, and are not'? The Church. Who were commanded in I. Cor. 5: 11, 12, 13, to put away the wicked person? The Church. If the Church was its own temporal ruler, then, it must be so now, or it is not identical with that Church. Talk to me about the supremacy of Popes!-do they ask much more than the clergy of the Methodist Church? Receive!! and Exclude!!!-arbitrary power! Has the Pope any more? Episcopacy with its popish attendants! What else? Are these features of Christ's Church? Read the Bible and see. I have heard your preachers swell with pride in the pulpit, when boasting of their connection  with the ' METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH '! I never heard a man of much intelligence do this, I ackn6wledge, but those who were ignorant of its abominable features, and had more respect for THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER,' John Wesley, than they did for Christ and his laws! "Grant you the 'key' power and you must concede succession, and then you are forced to admit that Romish apostasy is the only true Church, as it is the only reli- gious body that has held that dogma, for upwards of a thousand years." "I know our Church has some imperfections, but tell me what Church is there that has not?" asked Mr. Sumner. "All that are of human origin.' Christ's -Church is clear of imperfections, but the offspring of Catholicism, with all her traditions, such as infant baptism, sprinkling or pouring, and penances, &amp;c., could not, with the inven- tive genius of a Bezaleel, or a Aholiab be made perfect, outside of Episcopacy." "You will have it Mr. Weston, that we are the off-  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC8270-00000148"/> 290      lIa rNuJJ a &amp;uaa.  ligion is based on as far different principles as is Baptists religion." "Oh no sir. You cannot show one feature of the Baptist Church that resembles Chatholicism in the least. Baptists did not spring from Catholicism as did Protestants. You have no .right to talk of your god- mother like you do. Allow me to read you from a cele- brated writer, who justly portrays your connection. He here represents the Church of Rome as talking to her children. She reproves them of their irreverency in re- proaching her. "'Spare mc, my dear children, and honor your mother, f you would be respected. Do you not all call yourselves Protestants and. reformed?- You then admit yourselves once to have been a part of myself, and to have proceeded forth from me. Do you not today call youlrselves 'branches of THE CURCH?' Of what Church are you branches, but the HOLY ROMAN CATHOLIC, in which you all acknowledge you originated, and from which, as a branch from a pa- rent trunk, you confessedly proceed? If I, the Catholic Church, am the mother of 'harlots' and abominations of the earth, you are all my children and consequently are THOSE HARLOTS and ABOMNATIONS! You do not well my daughters, to cast reproach upon your parentage. Icom- mend to you the example and filialness of your sister, my favorite child, the Episcopal Church, which like a prodi- gal, is returning to her mother's house. .. My dear children do 'you not see that you commit suicide, by taking such a position to discredit my claims! You can- not with the least regard to reason, believe that such a system as yours existed in the'days of the Apostles, sure- ly, each radically differing from, and destructive of the other! Did Paul found an Episcopal Church at Antioch, a Presbyterian Church at Ephesus, and a Methodist one at Philippi? Certainly not. All the Churches that were founded in the Apostles' times, were one and identical in doctrine, in organization, ordinances and practices. But you do not even claim that you existed in the days of the. Apostles, or were founded by them. I know the parent- age of each of you, and beheld you when .you were born! You, my most dutiful Church of England, are the off- spring of my wayward and licentious boy, Henry VIIL., who was led astray by the love of the beautiful Ann Bo- ovn , A. D., 1584.   "' You my Lutheran daughter, by the bold and impet- uous Martin Luther, A. D., 1525. "'You, my Presbyterian daughter, by the stern and  austere Calvin, A. P. 1541; while I acknowledge you, dear Methodists, being all the childiren of Wesley, by, the Church of England, (A. D., 1784,) as my legitimate and worthy grand-children, and though quite too noisy and fa- natical, yet I cannot but be quite partial to you, since next ;o your mother, the Church of England, you possess nearly "1 my features; indeed, the likeness is striking and remark-  ible! . If I am BABYON, because I have persecuted and hed the blood of heretical Anabaptists, then do you also be- ong to Babylon, for which one of you all have not imbued rour hands in their blood? Your own garments are scar- et afd blood-dyed, as well as my own! It becomes us to reep these family matters among ourselves, and not charge ,ach other before our enemies.' "Was there ever a page written, by any uninspired wri- er, that contained more, or formed a more complete em-  )odiment of truth, than the one just read? I wish all of ,ou to read it over, and over again. If you doubt the triter, go search the pages of history, blurred with blood, out written by those who helped to shed that blood, and 'ou will find the above a true representation. Now I would ask you a few questions, Mr. Sumner. Where oes the Bible say the blood of the saints shall be Ound?" "I think. in Revelations it tells us that it is to be  ound in Babylon," answered the young preacher very ubmissively. "You are right, for to use, the language, 'And in her Babylon, the great city,) was found the blood of proph- ts, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the arth.' Now all admit that the city here spoken of, leans the Roman Catholic Church. So you admit too, rill you not?" "Yes sir, that is a conceded point." "Then in admitting that, you virtually acknowledge iat all protestant sects belong to the mystical Babylon, r thev all have shed the blood of the saints. Are [ethodists clear? No! no! They too have persecuted' ur brethren, and they too are allied to the women cloth-  i in purple and scarlet.

No, no, never! never will I embrace John Wesley's laws, in preference to my Saviour's. Never! Never! Me- thinks these words would forever haunt my ears: 'Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? This fact would lead me to remember that I had made false pretentious, or else I would have obeyed, for, 'This is the love of God, that we keep his command- ments.' "Had I not as well embrace the Pope and his cardinals as you? Is not one as well authenticated by the Bible, as the other? Are they not the same in principle? only the Pope's claims are the oldest which entitles him to more respect! You say you tdo not blame me for not communing with the Romaln Catholic, nor can you justly blame me for not communing with the Methodist, for neither can legally claim to be the Church of Christ, nor its branches, since it has none: 'For by one Spirit are we ..allbaptized into ONE BODY,' &amp;c., which .Christ loved, ' and - gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious Church, (not of Pope's Cardinal's, ]Bishop's devices,) not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and with- out blemish.' Is it possible for the devices of man to attain such? and of unregenerated .men too? Oh; when our blessed Saviour has given himself for his Church, that it might be found without blemish, will men know- ingly follow after -the traditions of men7 in opposition to that kingdom which he bought with his blood?" 4 Any one might judge from what you say, Mr. Wes- ton, that all Methodists will be damned for not joining your Church. I believe there are as many Methodists inl Heaven as there are Baptists. I have seen many good souls fall asleep in full faith of 'Christ, which were Meth- odists." "I don't doubt, that in the least Mr. Sumner, but I must join issue about number. The -Metlodist Church,  you must remember, is a mere infant by the side of the ,     .   Baptist, as to age. Who have filled the list of the mar- tyred Saints, from the days of the Alostles until now? Baptists! Then talk not of number. I will admit that I believe that many pious Methodists have gone to rest, but that does not exculpate the residue from doing their duty, because their ancestors are saved, who neglected theirs, some throughl ignorance, no doubt. Christian love prompts, entire obedience, instead of enough just to secure the soul's salvation." "But what is the use of non-essentials?" In one point of view there are no non-essentials. There are noie in Christ's Chrch. There is no com- mandment given by our Saviour, but what has some per- fecting object. If we take the right of setting aside one of his laws, we have the right of setting aside all. All the laws 'of his'-Chlurch are fundamental to the perfection of its mernbers. And are equally binding. If We-trans- gress one, we insult all. 'For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.'                      * "I repeat, Christ gave no non-essentials. All have their mission in. the Church. The Spirit he gave to lead- the heart to God. The blood, to cancel the   debt of sin; baptism as the. answer of a good conscience, by representing his burial and resurrection, and a willing- ness for his sake, to follow his glorious example; and the Lord's Supper, as a commemoration of his death, a par- ticipate interest in his blood. The former should pre- cede the latter, or we hlave no righlt to the latter. As he walked, so let us walk. As God was so particular about ever minutia about his temple, so must Christ be, or even more so about the antitype. Though I cannot say that baptism and the Lord's Supper, are essential to salvation, yet are they to Church membership. As people were saved. before the Light came, and nmlde the-Church visi- ble, without baptism, so can they now, since the Light has come and made the Church visible. His blood was as efficacious to the trusting heart of Israel, befot'e-it was spilled, as it is now, since it has been spilled, but' the Light came, and manifested it to the Gentiles, who before discerned it not, as it was not of this. seed. Do not un- derstand me to justify those who obey not Christ. I be- lieve that every one who loves God and has a proper , ]           . ,  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC8270-00000150"/> 294X      LEANDER HALL. conception of. the price with which his soul was ransom- ed, will not neglect the commands of our Saviour. But many do neglect his commands through ignorance; for such I have no law of punishment, yet woe to him who knows his duty, and does it not! "'But to the point. I want you to tell me, Mr. Sum- ner, here in the presence of our friends, from what sprang the Methodist Discipline. Consult Wesley's writings and you will see." Mr. Sumner nervously took one of Wesley's volumes, and began a rapid search. In a moment he found the place which he was looking for, and read to himself for a while. "If you are satisfied Mr. Sumner, we are ready for your answer," said Mr. Weston, after waiting sometime for it. Mr. Sumner laid the book down, and then, (hear it, ye Methodists, and profit thereby!) he said: "Mr. Wesley tells us that he compiled it from the Prayer-Book of the Cltirch of England, but with some modifications." "And whei'e did the Prayer Book of the Church of England originate? With the Pope! So boast the Episcopalians.* Then from whence come your creeds and Liturgy? From Rome!-and are of the 'abominations' of the 'mother of harlots.'" "But they are mere forms of worship, Mr. Weston. That is nothing to become so enthusiastic about. All Churches have them, either of one kind or another, ex- cept you strait-jacket Baptists." "I admit they are mere forms of worship, and those that exclude members too, if they don't come up to the requisi- tions; thereof! ' You know, and ackinowledge that it (Discipline) is not of the Bible.. Some writer tells us that the Episcopal Prayer-Book was compiled from Romish missals, used in the various dioceses of the country, that all its features are identical with that of the Roman Sa- cramentary. I am very much of the opinion of the Catholic Church when addressing her children-the less is said about your origin is the best for you. Your Liturgy then is of popish origin, and a mere form, but 'every point, great and small, must be kept, or the offender is at bSee Dr. Jarvis' Church History,   THE INVESTIGATIONS.       t95 once excommunicated by the temporary pope,-the itine- rant stranger. No one has a right to speak aught against that popish compendium, but Conference, and it being omnipotent, can change its rules to suit the occasions, and the laity must obey their mandate, regardless of our Saviour's commands, or the clergy will exclude the non- conformist!! Is this a feature of the Church of God? What is it but spiritual serf-dom?! and worse, a robbery of God's power!! That men should dare such a thing is to presume on what Christ suffered no one to do but him- self! Why need he wander three long years on this un- friendly earth, without home, or whereon to lay his head, if after setting up his Church to perfection-why need he submit to these deprivations, if men are to reform and change it to suit their conviences after his death?!! What sacrilege! and yet depraved descendants of Adam, with that declaration on their lips, will dare do it! Sure- - ly they know not what they do! "But the Methodist Church does not claim that divine, origin, hence to tamper with its rules and regulations- , to change them-to revise, or any other process of inno- vation, is no sin, for they are but compilem6nts from Ro- mish apostasy, and modified by uninspired and unregene- ted men!! therefore, are not the features of the Church! "Your Friday Fast, where did youiget that, but from Rome! Turn to the 29th page of the Discipline and see:. 'It is expected of all who d'esire to continue in these -so-- cieties to evidence their desire of salvation by-fasting or. abstinence.' Very good. We are all commanded to fast. But upon what day does this fasting' of the Discipline come? 'He (the preacher in charge) shall take care that a fast be held in every society in his circuit on the Friday preceding every quarterly meeting.' Now why Friday more than any other day in the week? Or why before the quarterly menting? Ask Catholicism; and the reply is penance! The Roman Catholic is put upon his con- science, when he comes to confess, so is the Methodist at the band meetings. / What's the difference in principle? The former confesses to the priest, the latter virtually the same. You know this is so, Mr. Sumner. The old Prayer-Book from which your Discipline was compiled, was composed of popish creeds, now it is but naturalthat a child should possess some of the features of its mother;  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC8270-00000151"/> but I must say in true candor, that the Methodist Church bears a stronger likeness to Catholicism, than the natural progeny of anything I ever saw!" The young preacher looked so "down in the mouth," that the writer dares not attempt to describe the woe-be- gone expression of his countenance. We can but feel some sympathy for him, for he was not possessed of the brass that some are, or he might have pretended a repu- diation.  "Your next feature now," continued Mr. Weston, is the Church or Society, taking in seekers. In the whole record of the Apostolic ministrations, there is not hn in- timation of such a policy. From the days of John the Baptist until the closing of the Apocalypse, there is noth- ing but a repudiation of the mixing of Christ's Church with the world." "' But, Mr. Weston, the mere giving of the hand to the minister is no harm. His (the seeker) name is just en- tered on the Church Book. We do this in order to win the seeker from the world, and throw around him the in- fluence of the Church. After joining us he cannot feel. so privileged to fall back on the world. The Church is a sort of an egisto him." "And that looks like forcing people into religion, in- dependent of the, power of God. You have not given a correct definition of it, however. This seeker refuge has a deleterious effect on the sinner. When he has become convinced of his depravity, his first inquiry is: 'Lord what must I do, to be saved?' When he comes to that point then is the time for the meritori- ous blood of Christ to be applied, but instead of that, you tell him to come and join the Church. He obeys. He is willing to do anything now, rather than experience the dreadful feeling from which he is fleeing. After join- ing the Church he feels better; he, has done his duty. He finally persuades his heart in to comparative ease. Thus he goes on until the expiration of the six months trial. Bythat time he has-become tolerably moral,:hav. ing been in the 'egis' of the Church until he has the form of godliness. He is jooked on as a member now, butstillin the bonds of iniquity. He is placed now where you can't preach to him. He is in the Church! And thus he lives and dies. There are exceptions to this :,   THE INVE STIGATION.       297 I know, but it is a thing very general. You know this, Mr. Sumner. You have taken such cases within the scope of your own observation. . "I lnow I have seen such cases, but all general rules have some exceptions .to them. We do this, Mr. Wes- ton, to give an individual an opportunity to see whether he likes us or not." "Yes, just so. You put him to seeking the Methodists instead of God. Such is not a feature 'of our Saviour's Church, therefore, the Methodist Church is not the Church of Christ, consequently I cannot commune with it. Neither has it any more right to celebrate the Lord's Supper than the little society of unconverted men who  met in 1729, at Oxford, to. read classic greek, from which Methodism sprang!! God has not given it the right, for Christ gave the institution only to his Church, and his Church only, has a right to this institution. He came to build up his Church, and then gave him- self for it. It was his Church, therefore, he had a right to give it, any command he thought proper. For any society of human invention, with an attendant train of popish liturgies, to rise up and claim the prerogatives of the Church of God, is down right robbery. Mason- ry has as much right to the ordinances of God's Church as Methodism. The origin of the former is claimed to be of Solomon,'while that of the latter is of John Wesley, an unregenerated man!! Every time you MNthodists cele- brate the Lord's Supper, you commit robbery! yea, lar- ceny accompanied with sacrilege! So with all other so- cieties, but the Church of Christ. "But to the next feature. You force that on childrefi, which you deny professed believers for a length of time. Youbaptize the unconscious babe, and put the believer off for six months. Does this look like a feature of Christ's Church? Every record in the New Testament concern- ing baptism, represents it as being given on the very same day of the candidate's redemption. Nfor is there an instance of baptism ever given'to any but believers-the regenera-  ted. Children are shapen ill iniquity, and conceivedin sin,' so David tells us. Then our Saviour said': 'Give not that  which is holy untothe dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lesttiey trample them under their feet, and turn gacin and rend you.' If baptism is holy, which we -   &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC8270-00000152"/> 298       LEANDER HALL. believe is, that is, the proper mode,) then giving it to those born only of the flesh, is like casting' pearls to swilne, or giving that which is holy to the dogs." Mr. Sumner had resigned all hope, conseuiently he made no effort of defense, or towards retrieving the sub- mitted grounds. He had given way inchl by inch, until he found himself standing on the sandy palladium of John Wesley, Coke and Asbury. He began to wish he was elsewhere, as the negro did, when his mraster caught him robbing the hen-roost. But we must pass on more rapidiy, dear reader, for time is beginnirig to shape itself into months, and we do Inot wish the harvest " to pafss and leave the task un- done. "Will you allow me to ask you a few questions, Mr. Sumner?"' asked Mr. Weston; after a pause of several moments.  ' "Certainly, Ir. Weston; ask as many as you wish,"  answered the young preacher, feeling sure that the cause - could not be much more worsted. "You never baptize infants by immersion, do you?" "No sir; it is not customary." "You sometimes baptize grown persons by immer- sion, don't you?" ( Yes, very frequently." '"Two baptisms then. One for infants, and one for adults!" "But -we always prefer baptizing by sprinkling,or pour- ing. We don't like to baptize by immersion at all, nor would we have that practice,but there are so many who have scruples on the subject." Oh yes, I know you prefer sprinkling. A child loves ts mother's habits! You prefer sprinkling or pouring, because your god-mother gave you that as a natural heri- tance. It is a popish feature, you love it, no one cant blame you, for it has ever been an emblem of. arbitrary power.

"'Q.-Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth? and in Jesus Christ, his on- ly begotten Son our Loid? and that he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary? that he suf- fered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried: that he rose again the third day; that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right handof God the Father Almighty, and from thence he shall come again at. the ond of the world to judge the quick and the dead?

A mere assent jthatV Jesus isthe Christ! The vilest sinner in M -- would admit as much; and I venture to say, there is not a man in this town who is not an infidel, that will contradict the fact that Jesusis the Christ?" "You know, sir, that we teach that evangelical faith is essential to salvation." "You may teach it, But look at your Discipline?-your guide! The book by which you receive your members!? Any unregenerated man can, even according to that Dis- cipline, claim baptism, and then Church membership. Just so he will say that Jesus is the Christ, and he will renounce the devil and his pomps. That is all the Dis- cipline requires." "But we profess-" "Profess what?-the Discipline's doctrine? I am not hunting up what you practice, for there is such- a contra- riety of practices by different Churches, that I would not attempt for any consideration, to follow them up. I am now tracing the mother's features in the child! If you administer baptism on the confession required by the Dis- cipline, what less is required in Campbellism? And worse what less asks the Catholic priest? '"You are certainly beside yourself, Mr. Weston! We believe as strongly in being born again, as you Baptista do! There is no comparison between our faith and the Catholics'." "It matters not what you believe, you are not bound to practice your belief, if not required by the Discipline, and we find that evangelical faith, or being born again, is not required by the Discipline. You are not asked whether you have passed from death unto life, but the same interrogatories in substance, are put you, that the Campbellites use, and they also coincide with theRomish requisitions. Now, sir, some may doubt this, but I am going to read the latter and let you draw comparisons.- Here it is Taken from the golden Manuel, of the Rom- ish Church. If you doubt it, look at the book.

"'I believe in the Holy Ghost; the Holy Catholic Church; the communion of the paints; the remission of sins; the resurrection of the body; and everlasting life  after death.' "Now what is the difference? Just the four words, 'he descended into hell'!" "But our discipline requires the candidate to renounce the world, the devil and all his pomp." -' So does the Catholic's. Hear it further: "'Priest :-'Dost thou renounce satan?' "Answer:--- I do renounce him.' "(Priest:-' And all his works? ' "Answer:-' I do renounce them.'  Priest:--' And all his pomps.' "Answer :-' I do renounce them.' ".Priest:--'Wilt thou be baptized?' (i. e., into this faith.) "Answer:-' I will.'  Now what difference can you find? None in sub- stance, I am sure. And this is the guide by which the clergy receive- members by baptism into the Church! I would ask you a question or two here. Which is the oldest, the Catholic or Methodist Church?" "The Catholic of course! Why do you ssk that question?" "Because I want a certain admission from your lips. Now that you admit the Catholic the oldest, you must admit also, that the Catholic creed existed first." "Certainly." "Then, where did yours come from?

"Well, you will have it that we are the descendants of the mother of harlots, I cannot help it," he hopelessly said after so long a time. N "No, for you know you are al BRANCH of the HOcLY CATHOLIC CHURCH! I have traced every feature of the Methodist Church nearly, and I find them all a counterpart in the Ronish Church! I True, the Church of Rome has some features which you do not possess! You have none, however, but what she possesses.. Your Discipline by which the Church is ruled, is but a compilement from Catholicism, and of its Creeds! Deny this if you wish, but as long as this little volume-this Great Discipline is in existence, the fact- will remain es- tablished. Your Conference should change its striking features of Catholicism. or you must ever be branded as a branch of the Romish Church! (which I presume you won't object to, since you are such a strong advo- cate of the branch system.) But these are not all of your features of resemblance. We will notice only a few more to-day." (Mr. Sumner began to think there had been enough brought up already.) ' "There is another very important feature to notice now. This, 'falling from grace!' It is a perversion of the Scriptures to teach such doctrine." "We do not teach it outside of the Scriptures. We are justified in teaching it," contended Mr. Sumner. "I know you pretend to have Scripture proof for such a creed, yet it is all the result of misapplication." "You are mistaken, sir. If apostasy is not taught in the Bible, nothing is!". exclaimed Mr. Bacon, rising'to his feet. He had been silent all the while, not deighing to make any remark, for to tell the truth, he was so vexed with the champion of Methodism, that he thought it a sacrifice of his dignity, to make any comments. "You must prove that it is taught in the Bible, or I cannot take your word for it. I'll take no evidence in the establishment of this point, but from the Bible." "Bro. Summer here, will do it; he understands the subject better than I do. Show him Bro. Sumner, that we, are right. I know you can do it. Why, sir, my own observation proves to me clearly enough, without the help of the Bible, that we can fall from grace!

They professed religion and joined the Church. Look at some of them now, and tell me that it is impossible to apostatize! Bro. Sumner, show Mr. Weston wherein he is wrong. I Give him some Scrip- ture that he cannot refute, and satisfy him at once." "I think myself," said Dr. Boon, " you are taking very untenable grounds, Mr. Weston. If we did not have so much evidence in observation, (and I do not doubt but what some, here, can say experience,) we might'be prepared to receive your theory." ".I only await Mr. Sumner's proof," replied Mr. Wes-  ton, calmly with no apprehensions. "Whichyou shall have forthwith. This subject has been much larvated in mysticisms by you Baptists, but for my life I cannot imagine where you imbibed such notions as characterize you in regard to it, for their propagation necessarily tends to lead the Christian astray from an express command, which is to watch and pray, lest twe enter into temptation. This is a positive corn- mand. The natural consequence of belief of a contrary- nature, leads the Christian to trust to everything, and to let self-exertion alone, which causes many a poor soul to wander from God carelessly, thinking his salvation is sure without an effort on his part. This life is a proba- tionary -state,-we are put here on trial, therefore, -it be- hoves us to watch, and work out our salvation with fear' and trembling."' "A very nicely arranged scheme, but it must be authen- ticated first," remarked Mr. Weston, in his usual imper- turbable tone. "That is what I'm going to do. You shall have proof enough sir. My first proof-text shall be, as ' Angels in  heaven have fallen,' so can we, for we are not near so per- fect beings." "Yes I think that is a consideration, sure enough, Mr.' Sumner," interrupted Dr. Boon. "We should tremble  with fear whenever we reflect on it.

I'll do no such thing. Angels have nothing to do with .men. They did not live under the dispensation that we do. Did Christ die for angels! He died for us, and it is by the eflicacy of his blood, together with the Holy Ghost, that we are kept. Hear that tried soul, whom satan had desired ' to sift as wheat' and who well understood the nature of the Christian's security: "' Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy, hath be- gotten, us again, unto a lively hope by the resurection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorrupti- ble and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.' 1 Pet. 1: 25. "Now, I would ask you all, (for you. all disagree with me,) is not God able to keep his children, without their ' working' and fearing eternal damnation?" "Oh yes, we acknowledge that He is, but will he do it without our own exertion? That's the question!" "Rest assured, a child of God will not be 'at case in Zion,' when God requires work at his, hands. But we can do nothing to merit salvation. We are told to watch, so we must, but not with the fear of being cut off if we do not, but because we love our' Saviour, therefore let us watch and look for his appearing, or our summons hence. Angels have no more to do with our falling from grace, than we have with theirs. Christ died for fallen man, and not fallen angels, so when we are'born to his love, no power on earth can separate us from it. It is an insult to his Majesty to say he is not' able to keep us in his love against powers or principles. Our Saviour said: 'My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give unto them eternal life, and THEY SHALL NEVER PERISH, neither SHALL any pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them me is greater than all; and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. At the last day, he will be able to say, as he did before his death; 'Of all the Father hath given me, have I lost ':-           ' '     4   THE INVESTIGATION.         O none, save the son of perdition, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.' Judas never was a sheep. He was nothing more than a professed disciple, a follower; for said the Sa- viour: 'Iave I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 'But I am taking up too, much time. Proceed to your next point, Mr. Sumner, unless you can prove that the case of 'fallen angels,' is a collateral incident to the certainty of man's apostasy. To prove that, you must prove that Christ died for fallen anRyls!"  ] "I will let that go and proceed to another greater point. Adam, from his purity fell, is it not possible for us who partake of his depravity to fall also?," "I will just ask you a question. Does it any wherein the Bible speak of a second fall? Man has fallen once, and that is the only fall he can make. I do not mean to say that we are clear of sin, because we are the children of 'God, no) we all sin more or less, but Christ has gone to the extent of the law, therefore our sin is not'laid to  our charge. Does our salvation rest on our own righte-  ousness; or partly on our own righteousness, and partly upon Christ's or does it rest entirely on the righteous- ness of Christ? Upon one of the three our security is de- pendant. The answer will be by you all, that our salva- tion rests on the righteousness of Christ alone. What can poor puny rnan do to merit salvation? I know we  are commanded to work, but that is not :imputed for righteousness. Works are of the law. We cannot be perfect in the law, but Christ is our substitute, therefore, as the Apostle speaks: 'And be found in him, not hav- ing mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of, Christ, the righteousness, which is of God by faith.' "Christ's righteousness is imptted to us, and our sins to him, that is, we that believe in him. And we are 'hid' 'with Christ in God.' All the wily arts and deceptions of Satan cannot depbse us, or the sanctuary of Christ will be profaned, and  entered by the Tempter,' to lure us from the grasp of Christ. This cannot be 2 done, for our Saviour has already defeated' the devil, therefore he is the 'strong man. How can the weaker enter and take his possessions, unless he first binds the 'strong man'? Can Christ be bound by Satan? YouH say Adam fell. Well, I know- he did; but had Christ - 26  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC8270-00000156"/> 306      LtEANDER HALL. died for him when he fell from his state of purity? He rose again also, when the promise of a Saviour was made. Did he fall afterwards? No! He was 'kept by the power of God' unto salvation. To fall from grace, you must suppose that the Devil is able to combat and overcome, 'The Promiiise of Creation's first breath,' for all that are born of God, are his, therefore the Devil cannot call them back to him.: But this is a monopoly. I leave it with you, Mr. Sumner, you can dispose of it to your notion, -and proceed to your next point."  I will proceed to another point; an instance of apos- tasy. This cannot be disputed, for it is so definite, and conclusive. In Ezek. iii. 20; we have a direct reference to such a case. 'When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commitiniquity, * * * he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered.' What is plainer than that? Your argument brought up on the last point was very good, but this is a refutation of it all.' "That might do, Mr. Sumner, if we were saved by works, but we are not, therefore the case referred to, is not synonymous with ours. You remember God gave a law in the Jewish dispensation, by which his people were governed and justified as to temporal blessings. If that laW was obeyed, a lonIg life and great prosperity was the result, if not, death was the penalty. Even Moses, that meek and humble servant of God, disobeyed and was not permitted to see the promised land. Canwe suppose that he was lost or fell from grace? NaTy verily'! Then the. righteousness of which the prophet was speaking was one of works, whose merit was of temporal blessings. .A covenant of works' which' had nothing to do with the covenant of Grace. Man, as to tempQral blessings, was governed by the covenant of works until Christ came and died under the law, and rose above it, so that man's life was no longer dependant on the law of work, for per- petuation, and continuance; in God's favor, but on the righteousness of Christ. ;But I am taking up too much time agin. Prove to me that the righteous man ot whom the prophet, was speaking, belonged to' the cove- nan't of Grace, and was cut off from the covenant of grace instead of the covenant of works, and I will allow that to go as an infallible proof of your proposition, But   THE INVESTIGATION.        307 you cannot do this, for you know the prophet says; 'And his righteousness (works) which he hath done shall not be remembered.' The covenant of works was of tempo- ral blessings, therefore his works under that covenant should not be considered, if he turned to iniquity. It was not the covenant by which Abraham was justified, for we, are told he (Abraham) was justified by faith. You cannot make that instance agree with that-of the Christian, unless you make the Christian, saved by- his works, and not by the merit of our Saviour. Yet you may take it, and do what you wish with it." Mr. Sumner did not take it up; he concluded to go on to another. Mr. Bacon began to get very apprehensive. He had been along the same track before, but on a difierent sub- ject, and he had seen his cause pushed aside'so often, that it was nothing but natural that he should look for it again. At first he' grew very morose under such mis- fortunes, but since he was assured of his daughter's satis- faction, he had learned to take these ill-crossings with some philosophy, attributing them to paralogism. Well, some consolation is better than none, but oli! if Mr. Ba- con had known the true state of affairs, he could not have borne these missiles with so much fortitude. He had always thought that his daughter was of rather intractable composition, consequently he never made an effort to reconcile her when she made the revelation to him at the table-the time of which we have given no- tice previously. But when Mr. Taylor came to M-- with his trumpery of eloquence, and reconciled the girl, as he thought, Mr. Bacon changed his mind towards his daughter, and even reproached himself for eitertaining isuch unwarranted feelings against her. But to the subject.  Mr. Sumner brought up his next infallible prooftext, which was:                       : "In Heb. vi: 46, and x: 26-29, I think we are satis- fled in entertaining the opinion that we do." ' ' Wil i you read the passages referred to Mr. Sumner?"  "UCertainly!. iThirs is the first: 'For it is impossible for tlose Wh Bo^*'ret6mee enlightened, and have tasted of  the Heavenly gifts, .an. were made partakers of the Ho-  ly Ghost, and have tasted the goo4dword of God. and the  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC8270-00000157"/> 308      LEANDER ' HALL. powers of the world to come-if they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crncify to themselves the son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."' 4 Well, I can't see that that proves anything for you, unless it proves too much, for contrary to your doctrine, it proves that if such a thing should happen, it would be impossible to renew them again! You teach that we 'may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of God rise again and amend our lives.' If this passage proves that it is possible for man to fall the second time, it also proves that it is irpossible for him to be renewed again! I think the less you say abodt that passage the better." "We can afford to let it pass, as we have many others on hand," said Mr. Sumner, glancing uneasily around. "But I will not let it pass. The passage just quoted, is a mere supposition. Paul merely supposes such a thing, which he goes on to show in the 9th verse-' But beloved we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.' Read the next passage."  Mr. Sumner obeyed with reluctance. "'For if we sin Willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin, but a certain fearful looking for of judg- ment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adver- saries. He that despised Moses' law died without mercy, under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer pun- ishment suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace?' "If apostasy is not taught in this passage, it is not in the Bible. It is just as plain to me as A, B, C. I don't see how you can get around this conclusive text, Mr. Weston," added Mr. Sumner, with satisfaction. "Nor do I. You must give it up Mr. Weston, this time. The last proof text quoted, is incontrovertable, and stands out too glaringly, to be smoothed over," said Dr. Boon.' "You can afford to allow us to be right in this one onrincinla. Mr. Westonn" nl eaded Mr. Se mm   THE INVESTIGATION.        309 "Not without leaving our cause with some imperfec- tions, which I do not intend to do, as long as the Bible holds up for us. The proof-text just quoted is on aparwith the one preceding. As I said, if it proves anything, it proves too much for you. It proves, if we do this, or if such a thing were possible, there would be no more sac- rifice for the sin-that it would be impossible to be renewed again. This like the other, does not help your cause in the least, but rather impedes it." "But you will acknowledge this much Mr. Weston, that it i, possible for man to 'fall from grace,' won't you?" "  "No; no; never." "But this passage says it is." "I contend that it does not. The whole thing is like the other, a mere supposition. It was quite common for Paul to suppose things, that were impossible, and improbable. For instance he says: 'But though we, or an Angel from Heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.' Now, are we to suppose that Paul meant to teach the Galla- tians that possibly he or an angel would preach some other gospel? To conclwade that such a thing is probable, because it was supposed, is as subversive of the plan of salvation, and as dangerous to believe as the real occur- rence of the latter supposition. "There are other suppositions he makes equally, if true, as fatal to the Christian hope. As these: "' If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable.' "Did Paul mean that such a thing was probable be- cause he supposes it? or that it was even possible, because he reasoned thus? If you are wedded to- apostasy so that you cannot give it up, you must also embrace these two fatal suppositions. "In one chapter the non-resurrection of the dead is hy- pothecated by Paul five times, and the non-resurrection of Christ twice. Because of these hypothecated pas- sages, are we to question the resurrection of the dead, or of Christ? Is apostasy supposed as often - as non-resur- rection. But this is not all. The apostle goes on and says: 'BT BT' W E ARE NOT OF THEM WHO DRAW BACK UNTO '  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC8270-00000158"/> 310     ' t EANDER .HALL., PERDITION; BUT OF THEM THAT BELIEVE TO THE SAVING OF THE SOUL.' Evidently meaning, that though hehad sup- posed such a case, they f(the Christians,) were not of a class to whom such should happen. "I cannot see why any one should propagate such doc- trine, when 'it is fatal to the Christian's hope. Were we left to ourselves on trial, none of us would prove faithful, but thank God we are kept by Mis power unto sal- vation!"  There was a silence of several momentsa Mr. Sumner wass at a loss to make any reply. He moved his chair a little further from the table and ran his fingers through his hair several times very rapidly. Perhaps he was try- ing to stir up ideas. If any were resurrected they-did not appear, for he only remained the more tacit, glancing at-his betrothed, almost- hopelessly. Mr. Sumner could but entertain some indefinable feeling of uneasiness, which hs imaginative genius had not the prescience to ar- range in any definite form. Mr. Bacon was out done. He regretted sorely of ever allowing the investigation to take place in his house. He wished it through with for the hundrethl time. "Our time is' gettiing short, Mr. Sumner, proceed to your next point, so that we may get through with this subject to-day," said-Mr. Weston. "But what's the use of my bringing additional proof, when youknow you will find a plea against all, or any I might introduce? It is just a waste of time to hunt out passages of Scriptures for you to handle, and explain away. We will drop this point, or some one else may take:it up besides me," said the young preacher, becom- ing somewhat excited. "Oh no, that will never do, Mr. Sumner; if you have more proof bring it p'- insisted Mr. Weston. '"No; I will not have any more-to say on' this point. You may have it any way you wish. I don't feel con- cerned much any how.- It is not a matter of importance at all. You Baptists will have your opinion about it, were I to expend my :la4t breath in trying to convince you otherwise. So let u^drop the subject."  - ' Allow me at least, to bring up some proof in favor of my positio i  ethe  ameadatae that yooq had, wil younot? ask"edMW. Weston.   THE INVESTIATIO N .       3" "Do as you please. Bring up as much as you please, if itis the whole Bible," responded Mr. Sumner, petu- lently. "Oh no; I have not time, were it, (the Bible) a treatise on that only, but I do want to bring up some, so that my friends here may see that our grounds are not untenable, and more expressly to establish them in their faith of final perseverance. I will just submit a few passages of Scripture that unquestionably preclude the idea of a be- liever's apostasy. "'No man can enter into a strong man's house' and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.' (Mark. iii. 27.) "Can Satan despoil Christ? Which is the strongest? Christ. Then he is the master of'his house, and its pos- sessions, which are his people. "Again: 'When a strong man armed keepeth his pal- ace, his goods are in peace, but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and - divideth his spoils.'-Luke xi. 21, 22.)  "Now the joy of angels. Do you suppose, Mr. Sum- ner, that heaven was 'ever vocal i praises over anything -that was to turn ouat badly? '  "4Why no, of course not." "And yet you teach the doctrine of apostasy." "I do not understand you, Mr. Weston." "Well, lsten at this, and perhaps you will understand. "ikewise I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God, over one-sinner that repenteth.' How foolish it would be in angels to rejoice over uncertainties-! It seems to me, their experience in watching Church his- tory for 6,000 years would teach them better! and would teach them to suspend their joy until the saint triumphed  and mounted on high- But this was not the way. An- gels saw and comprehended, What had been done for  man, and they knew that man was no lunger on trial, but 'hid' in Christ, or the promise of his coming, and 'kept  by the power of-God unto salvation.' That salvation was of grace, independant of the works of weak frail man, and it was a gift of everlasting life. Well might  they rejoice! and well may Christian friends rejoice when a sinner is converted!      .    . r  .  x  , .

Answer me this question, Mr. Sumner. Is there any power to dissolve the union between the Father and Son?"' "No; you know no one could suppose such a thing.

"That your admissions may aid in convincing you. ihe Son tells us that he is in the Father, and the Father is in him, and that 'I in them,' which is also a union as impossible to dissolve as that of the Father and Son.

He depended on his own strength for salvation, when Christ told him that Satan had desired to sift him as wheat, but sad experience told him, that such reliance would not do, so the first epistles he ever writes after he denied his Saviour, were accompanied with his rejoicings, because the Chrstian was 'kept by the power of God!' insteadof his own trial and strength. "But I must proceed faster.

(Heb. vi. 18,19.)  "The sinner is,tried and condemned but once.--There is, therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ  Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.' (Rom. viii: 1, 2.) 'For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness, with our spirits, that we are the children of God; and if children then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.' Who can disinherit us?- Who can take our heirship of glory from us? Hear the Apostle's answer: 'And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according ,to his purpose.' "Stop Paul! may you not be mistaken? . We are told that 'many are called' but few chosen; it may be that some of these are the rejected, or those who failed to work out their salvation in true arminian style. You must be mistaken. "No; ' whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he-also glorified.'

Take this away-take the fact of our 'being kept by the power of God,' and the Christian's hope would stand on no surer foundation, than the Jewish chance of temporal blessings-a covenant of works. There is such a striking contrast here between the Spiritual water and that of the letter. To drink the former, we can never thirst again, (can we fall from grace?) but of the latter we shall. How much better would the former be than 'the latter, if our grace only lasted from one camp-meet- ing to another, or from one protracted meeting to another? What is attractive about such religion? But thank God this is not the case; we are kept by his power, and not by the merit of our works. It is of God's strength and  not of ours. Lest you think me tedious, I will proceed more rapidly.  "Christians are conquerors-- All that the father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.'

"But it may be possible to lose that love, Mr. Weston. I know I have seen a great many devout Christians fall back to the world, and become the most consummate vil- lains in existence," remarked Dr.-Boon. ' "I protest against your view. Hear what the Apo tle John says about such as go back to the world. 'They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.'-(1 John ii: 19.) "I have not time to make any comment on this, but suffice it to say, he who says he was once a child of God, and is not now, is a deceiver-he has gone out from us that it might be manifest that he never was of us. He might have been a professor, but not a possessor. But to pro- eeed. ' 'For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and your labor of love which ye have showed towards his name, that ye have ministered to the saints and do min- ister.' 'Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward/ Now if a person fall from grace and be sent to hell, how can this be true? When or where, or how could he be rewarded, or remembered? How grossly inconsistent is your theory with the teachings of the Bible! "The seed planted in the heart and liveth forever.- ' Born again of incorruptible seed, which liveth and abideth forever.' (1 Peter i: 23.) "The Christian is not an incomplete tower. 'For which of. you intending to build a tower, setteth not down first and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to fin- ish it?

' Being confident of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you, i will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.' (Phil. i : 6.) "And the Christian's foundation is a sure one.

"Iow can man, poor vile man, dare disseminate doc- trine derogatory to the omnipotence of God? It is a presumption on his Majesty's power! Man, in the gar- den of Eden, clothed in the image of God, even then could not stand a trial, could you think now, after his degeneracy, he could stand a trial of his own strength? Nay verily; Jesus Christ now stands between his people and temptation, he is the substitute for the covenant of works, and the fortified wall against the wiles of Satan. Adam had no such in his paradisiacal state; he stood on his own trial and fell. Since the promise that the seed of woman should bruise the Serpent's head, there has ever  stood between man and the Devil, a rock of defense. That the precious blood of Christ has no more efficacy than to put on trial, is an insult to the Son, who,' by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified.' Surely such is counting the blood of the covenant, wherewith you are sanctified as an unholy thing-  no more than the blood of bulls and of goats which were  offered, and 'remembrance again made of sins every year.'

Oh what a blessed hope the Christian has; a hope of which no one can rob him. You must hurry Mr. Weston; our time is most out," interrupted Dr. Boon, who from the first introduction of that point had remained silent, because he found out that this " falling from grace," would not do. "Discretion the better part of valor," happened to be now silence, so Dr. Boon thought and profited by thq timely suggestion. "So I will," responded Mr. Weston, looking at his d watch. "There are other passages which 1 would like to quote before closing, but time is too short; nor will it do to divide the subject, or lay it over until next week, (as to-morrow will be Saturdav, and Mr. Sumner has to go to the country,) for the importance of it might be: for- gotton. However, if any of you wish its continuance, we can take it up next week." Mr. Weston waited a moment for some reply, but no one said anything, so he proceeded. "I presume you all are willing for us to wind up this point. But let us see where it originated. We are told that the Waldenses and others of that class all clung to the 'final perseverance of the Saints,? and rejected the offer of indulgencies, even-to the sacrifice of their lives, and also refused absolution. What was the ostensible object of this selling indulgencies? You answer that questioin for me, if you please, Mr. Sumner." "Well-really, I don't-but I believe it was for the re- mission of future sins which the applicants might com- mit."               *' I "And should they commit sin without paying indul- gences, what was the threat, or awful end prophesied to such, should they die in their sins?" "They were told by the pope and his cardinals that  they would go to everlasting perdition." ' Yes sir, such was the case, and is the original minia- ture view of apostasy!" "What do you ifeah, Mr. Weston?" exclaimed the young preacher, in surprise.   THE INVESTIGAION.        319 "That apostasy originated from buying and selling in- dulgences, and from absolution in part, In the missal- sacramentaries of the Roman Catholic Church, the remis- sion and indulgencies became a prominent point. From these missals we are told the Episcopal Prayer-book was compiled, and from that the Methodist Discipline! The theory was arranged thus: After indulgences were grant- ed, and the time of their security expired, the subject was capable of sinning, and falling back from the grace given by the priest. This was taught by the pope, and p)racticed by the priests, in order to collect funds from the laity. To have remission pronounced over his head again, the subject was to pay a large sum of money, (as much as he was able,) against future ex-communication, (falling froml g race.) This is but a species of penance, and is where the notion, and from which the now prevalent doctrine of 'falling from grace,' sprang. From the Pope to the Episco- pals, and from the Episcopals to the Methodists! True, there are some modifications in its features, but the linea- ments are yet discernable by resemblance to its grand- parent, Rome. If the fountain-head be corrupt, so must the stream issuing therefrom. And hence arbse the doc- trine of saving one's self by works. As the subject of the pope saved himself by merit of his money, whether avowedly or not, it is bound to be equivalent to the pos- sibility of falling from grace, as the advocate of such doctrine urges on the Christian the necessity of works, lest he falls back into error. So teaches the one who be- lieves in falling from grace." Mr.-Sumner offered no comment on this. If any one doubts its correctness, we would ask him to take the Meth- odist Discipline and trace it back, by its resemblance to the Episcopal Prayer-book, and from thence to the Ro- man Catholic Church, and there he will find the doctrine of "falling from grace" first propagated in the form of buying and selling indulgences.  "But to the subject," Mr. Weston continued, in a mo- ment. "We have traced nearly all of your prominent features back to your grandmother, Rome, who - has wa- tered the plains of the Alpine valleys with blood, from her persecuting power, and has capped the proud citadels above the Piedmont vales with stakes and gibbets, upon which our brethren have perished by the hundreds and  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC8270-00000163"/> 3 6       LEAtBER HBALL. thousands. This is your origin, and you ask me to call you to the Lord's table and partake of Christ's body! as though you were his Church!! "In the onset you admitted, together withl others of your denomination, that the Lord's Supper belonged to thevisible Church of Christ. Afterwards you conceded also that there was but one true Church of Christ, and that it was solecistic to call any other the Church of God but the one he established. Afterwards, you also admitted that the government of Christ's Church was of Divin:e origin. And then on that you acknowledged that the government of your Church (the Methodist Church,) was of purely human origin, and proven from its found- er's own statements, that it was disten!) set up by un- converted, unregenerated men!! (And you ask me to fel- lowship it!) It was proven that the Discipline of said Church (?) was taken from the Episcopal Prayer-book, which was compiled from Romish creeds, and all the fea- tures of your Church were traced thereto. You also ac- knowledged that the woman clothed in purple and scar- let, was the mystic Babylon, in which all the blood of the saints is to be found. That woman, you said, was the Catholic Church! and you the granddaughter in descent! the sister in resemblance!! Can the Methodist Church be the Church of Christ? I ask you candidly, Mr. Sum- ner, that you speak here under the evidence brought up, in the presence of that All-seeing eye, and in the pres- ence of intelligent individuals who have been witnesses to this investigation, I ask you prayerfully, do you believe that the Methodist Church is the Church of God?" There was a silence-oh! how profound! The rapid pulsation of each heart in the room could be heard! Yet no answer came. "But a more thorough recapitulation," continued Mr. Weston. "We began with your baptism. It would not do, for it carried us back to Rome! And sprinkling was acknowledged by your own men to have originated fromi heathenish practices, and first recognized by Pope Ste- phen as valid. This was no mark of Christ's Church, for I proved from the meaning of the word baptizo that it was immersion; from the manner in which it was spoken of as to place, that it was immersion; from the design as a figure that it was immersion, and that- there was but   THE INVESTIGATION.        321 'ONE BAPTISM.' Your Church lost its identity with Christ's Church in that respect.  "We came next to infant baptism. You said it was in the Old Testament. We searched diligently, and lo! even according to your own statement it was not there! Then you flew for refuge to the New Testament, and there sheltered yourself under probabilities, but I proved that even probabilities were not there, for all baptized throughout its pages were believers. Then you referred me to its antiquity. This was a difficult track, I admit, but we found evidence enough to prove that it was not thought of until the last of the second, and about the first of the third century, and that kind of infant bap- tism was not the kind you practice. You averred that it was impossible for so important an innovation to have sprung up in so short a time; therefore it must have been in practice during the Apostles' days, which you know you failed to prove from their writings. Well, I referred you to the United States, their rapid origin, and the sud- den changes since, all in less than a century. You gave up the plea. Then we ben auto trace it to its proper and legitimate origin, and-front whose courts you received the decree which the Baptists fir ages have renounced un- to blood, and to their almost extermination. We look- ed and beheld Rome, the woman in scarlet (bloody appa- reD, and purple, (kingly apparel,) enforcing it at. te gib- bet and stake, at the guillotine and the prison, at the suf- focation in caves, and the doom of the precipice, and at every conceivable door of death. We- looked at your record, and found it like a little horn springing from that very corrupt fountain, and inheriting that very institu-  tion from your god-mother. Is this a mark of Christ's Church-a people 'called out' and separated from the world? I leave you to judge of that. "This was not all. We found that Christ's Church ex- isted in the days of the Cmssars, and yours to have found its separate establishment, only a little over a century ago. Under such facts, could the Methodist Church have been the Church of Christ, against which he declares the gates of hell shall not prevail? Let your conscience dictate an answer. "Again: we came to the principles of your Church- its Episcopacy, its unscriptural origin, its fatal and ob-  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC8270-00000164"/> 322      .LBEANDER HALL. noxious doctrines, and we traced them to Rome! We found nothing but a society of men, with the rules and regulations of the Pope, and no more the Church of God than the proud Pharisees, and you ask me to commune with that society-to take the sacred element, which you admitted belonged, exclusively, to the visible Church of God, which we find always celebrated by the Church as a body, and not as individuals-You ask me to take that sacred element and offer it to every society in the world, that claims to be a Church. What more right have I to ask the followers of John Wesley to come to the Lord's table, than the followers of Mahomet, or of Tom Paine? Voltair? or of Pope Boniface? or any other class set up by men? Does hat sacred feast belong to me? No! It belongs to God's Church-Christ's followers-those who have obeyed his commands; for, remember, -the Supper.,was the last institution given, and also remem- ber, everything came in its place in God's Church. There was no happen-so; Christ arranged all things just as he wished with regard to order. So understood the Apostles on the day of Pentecost, and so practiced the Church in- their age,. "Again: Since you have made the concessions, which are but legitimate and right-since you admit that the Lord's Supper belongs to his Church, and his Church alone, and since you know, and acknowledge that there is but one Church, I ask you, can you, in the face of the evidence brought up, believe that the Methodist Church is the Church of God? and that it has any right to the tord's Supper?" There was a pause. Mr. Sumner's countenance -be- came livid, and his frame trembled like the disturbed as- pen. No answer came! Mr. Weston continued: "Allow me to answer that question for you, Mr. Sum- uer: The Methodist Church is no more the true Church of God, than thb little classic Greek society, that nmet at Oxford in November 1729, composed of three unconvert- edyoung men-John Wesley, the head of which, andl Methodism the result!!

You ask me for my grounds for close communion, here they are, in plain and unqualified terms. Yours is not the Church of Christ, and you teach other doctrine than that taught in the Bible. I am told to have no commu- nion with you, and I will obey!" Mr. Sumner drew a long sigh, but its calmness only grew to frenzy. He arose, and snatched up his hat hur- ridly and said: "Gentlemen, I tpreunle a continuance of this dis- cussion will De of no benefit to any of us, or to 'me at least, so I forthwith declare my non-fellowship with this soci- ety.

He knew it would not leave a favorable impression on Annie, but he could stand that embarrassing position no longer. - In a moment or two, a servant came in, with a request from Mr. Bacon, (who refusing to hear the closing speech of Mr. Weston, had retired,) that they would cease for- ever, the investigation in his house, as it was becoming very unpleasant to him. Upon which, Mr. Weston in- vited the residue to meet at his house at any future time, and they could prosecute their object, viz: Find the Chnrch with which, one could legitimately commune, and seek fellowship of that Church.  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC8270-00000165"/> CHAPTER XXIII.

Mr. Sumner left the Hall, and strode rapidly towards his home, almost in frenzy. He was hardly conscious of what he was doing. However, he knew that his course was not very praisaworthy, but he had no idea of the extent of anger that manifested itself when he arose to leave. Nor was he apprised that each intonation of his voice was seasoned with rising choler. There was also a slight invective tone which was no doubt, more jar- ring than he was aware of, on the one whom, most of all, he should have striven to please. He was about half way home, when the dinner bells of M'--, began their mu- sical reverberations over the surrounding hills, but it was all lost to him. Once in his private sanctuary, he closed the door, and sat down and began to think. What a tu- mult of gloomy thoughts, ran through his mind! Their depth was unfathomable by description, for no pen could half reach their gloom, though every dialect combined, in the known world, were brought into use. Mr. Sumner was at a loss to know what to do. He had committed himself hopelessly. Nor could he recon- cile himself to stay in M-- that evening; so he hastily swallowed a few mouthsful, and then adjusted his ward- robe with but little care, and left the place for the country. He congratulated himself upon having an appointment out of the town, the next day, but how was he to meet the inquiries of the brethren about the discussion? All knew that it was going on, and all were anxious to hear from it. He was a man possessed of conscientious scru- ples, therefore he could not say that he had come out victoriously, neither did he desire to-say that he had been   THE HNVESTIGATION.       825 defeated. Here was a dilemma. What was he to do? He began to think of this after he left M---, and once he concluded to return home, and shut himself up in his room for the evening, but that would not do, for some Brother would be sure to call during the hours, and how could he refuse to' see him? And then, he was obliged to go to the country on the morrow, any way, so he col- cluded to brave it out that evening. After mature delib- eration, he determined to be honest, at all hazards; he would tell the brethren just how things stood, and it was not for the want of competency on his part that he could not sustain himself, but the want of genuine support from the Bible. Mr. Sumner might have made his cause ap- pear a little better than he did, by resorting to paralo- gism -he might have picked at phrases, and hatched up a specious plea in contradictions, but he knew that such argument would not count with Mr. Weston, and he would be exposed in the attempt, so he forebore. As his steed paced leisurely along the ravine path, he resolved to tell the brethren all, yea he would tell of his signal defeat and the convictions consequent thereon, and oh! what a load of heaviness was lifted from his heart by these resolutions. But he was no less maddened by such considerations, for he loved the Methodist Church, even above the Church of God'! He was scarcely six months old when he was brought within its pale, and but sixteen when he professed religion. He studied for the ministry several years, after his majority was attained, and had only been preaching about three years., No won- der he loved the society, when he had been a member of it for nearly thirty years! His mother had lived and died there, his father too, and his sister was a burning and shiining light of its congregation. For these considera- tions, he loved it in all its weakness, and with all of its imperfections, and for which, he was willing to make any sacrifice. He reached the iouse of a Brother about an hour be- fore sunset, closing the exercise of such gloomy reflec- tions. This was near the Church at which he was to preach the next day. Mr. Cranmer, (the host) saw him coming, and hastened to greet him cordially. "Why, Bro.

Wasn't he frightened out of his wits?" and Mr. Cranmer, in his eagerness, drew himself closer to his friend, and inclined his head to catch every sentence that he might utter. "You are mistaken in this man- " "Why, isn't his name Weston? I thought so at least," he interrupted.  "Oh yes, his name is Weston, but he is a shrewder man than one would take him to be." Eh--?" "He is indeed a man very well posted, and very well authenticated in his doctrine."' "Not in close communion, I hope!  "Yes, he even has more argument on that point than any one would suppose, who was unacquainted with the subject.' "To-be-sure! Where on-earth does he get it from? Not from the Bible, for I have read "it through, and never have seen one line that would Warrant him in such doc- trine." "Yes sir, he is supported by the Bible, and he also de- / ducts much from reason. I don't think I cannever con- demn close-communion as I have. In fact, I shall always have more respect for the Baptists as a denomination any way. I don't think they are altogether as chargeable with error as people suppose them."   THE INVESTIGATION.        327 Mr. Cranmer was a little crest-fallen; for he was not prepared for such news, having indulged in the fancy that the foe was vanquished. "But how did you come out?" at length he asked, ra- ther timidly. "Hardly creditably, if I must be honest," he responded. Mr. Cranmer took the hint, and avoided asking more questions. If he had known all, he would not have mani- fested such anxiety, and such exuberance of joy when our hero first arrived. Return with me, dear reader, to the town of M---, the theatre of most of the scenes connected with this story, and there accompany me with your heartfelt sym- pathies, for they will certainly be called into requisition. In the dark recess of a curtained chamber sat the he- roine of our present recital--Annie Bacon. A few days, in contemplation of leaving home forever, had wrought oh! such a change. She did not know that she was tak- ing it so hard, herself. She did not consult her mirror only in the shades of a closed window, therefore as she descended to the parlor; day by day, she was all uncon- scious of the haggard expression, and restless look which enveloped her countenance. Mr. Sumner had observed' this change and attributed it to confinement, and perhaps excitement. The reader must imagine that it was no easy task for Annie to make such a resolution. Born and raised under a roof where want had never dared lurk without being ferretted out by every gratification which opulence could give. Born under the smiles of doating parents, and raised up by a father who had emptied his every treasure at her feet, we must know that it was indeed a trial al- most beyond endurance, to the young and inexperienced heart, but there was no other alternative, for her 'father had issued the decree, which knew no abrogation in his courts of adamantine enactments. Poor Annie! As she sat in her room .that evening after the conclusion of the subject, her heart was almost chilled with its emotions, when she reflected on the conse- quences of carrying out of resolutions. In her essays of devotion, her heart could only wander in the dark fu- ture, groping its way amidst the impenetrable gloom ex- hibited thereby.  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC8270-00000167"/> 328       LEANDER HALL. It was now Friday Evening. The week was drawing rapidly, to a close, though this dreadful communication had not been made to the father! nor to the lover! How could she do it? As we visit her chamber, we find her trying to summons courage for the task. Behold her on her kpees supplicating the throne of mercy, but the act spoke more than her heart could articulate, for tears seemed to choke utterance, and also take the place of thought. Oh how she wished for the counsel of a gentle mother! but alas, this boon was denied her, even when most needed. Yet, what were all her sufferings to our Saviour's? What were such shadows to the horrors of Golgotha, or the pangs of Calvary? And can we refuse to obey his commands? How little is required of us, and yet what an incalculable bounty is awarded those who delight in his law! But poor vile mortal man, dares often to question the essentiality of the farewell admoni- tions of Jesus, though given by Him who freely wrote immortal redemption with Christ's blood, and his own woes!"Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things I say?" should plunge remorse, like a deadly stiletto in every heart that is steeped in such baneful in- fluences! What right have we to alter his laws, or to call to ac- count the merit of their obedience? What if baptism is not essentialto salvation, is it not insulting to the God-head, to doubt its necessity! Oh wicked and puny man, how dare you do it? What manner of love is this, that obeys only from dire obligation? Surely, it cannot be the Christian's, " whose delight is in the law of the Lord." But to the subject under first consideration. In vain did Annie form resolutions to go right then, and tell her father, but they all found their death almost as soon as birth. As the evening wore away to dusky twilight, she began to wonder what had become of Mr. Sumner. She had looked for him all the evening to come and apologize for 'his abrupt departure, but twilight deepened to darkness, and yet he came not. She remembered also that should he come the tidings had to be communicated to him, and by herself too. In taking the contemplated step, she would -have to sacrifice all temporal blessings, and cut short their prospects. But she had resolved to brave the storm by the help of Omnipotence.   THE INVESTIGATION.        39 In the long hours of watch, she became so fatigued that while reposing her head on the window sill, she fell asleep. Oh precious moments of forgetfulness! But she dreamed. Yes the mind that had been envel- oped in seething thought all day, still ran mechanically in the same channel, while the body was in rest. A pic- ture loomed up before her, of inky hue. She saw herself torn from her home, while a deep bed of water, swept itself unceremoniously between her and the parental roof. The lover also stood on the opposite banks with out- stretched arms, imploring her to come back. But im- pelled by some irresistible power, she began the ascent of a steep cliff; turning her back on her friends. She reached the summit. The naked granite glittered in the sunshine like diamonds, and a purling stream, gushing from the mountain's heart, spread its silvery sheet at her feet, invi- ting her to slake' her thirst. She reached and drank. It was no Tantalus bowl, but, the spirits brewed by Deity's hand to cool the parched heart, athirsted by depravity's. passions, wreaking the soul's heart's blood by their un- wearying and baneful propensities. Anon the scene changed. A year had flown, with it a countless throng of sad incidents. In her home deserted, she saw herself forgotten. And the lover whom she had forsaken for duty, she saw leading to the altar another bride! leaning confidingly on the arm, which should have been her sup- port. The scene was too vivid. It could be traced no longer without arousing the physical powers. And how relieved was that troubled heart, when it first be- came conscious and found that such was not real. But she whispered, as she took a retrospective view: "A true picture." Annie, when she realized that she had been dreaming, bounded to her feet to shake off the feeling of depres- sion, and to be sure of arousing thelmembers of herbody to action. It had grown quite dark. There was no light in her room. She cautiously groped her way until she found the bell, which she rang for lights. "I-as Mr. Sumner been here this evening?" she asked the girl, who came to light the lamp and replenish the oil. "No mam, he's done left town ever since dinner. La Miss Annie did'nt you know it?"  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC8270-00000168"/> 380     - LEANDER HALL. "No; how should I know it, and I have not been out of my room? Where did he go?" she asked, not satisfied with the girl's intelligence. Here the servant who had been kept posted as to local items of the town, by Jake the errand boy, failed in in- formation for once. She did not know where the young preacher had gone, nor did any one in M-- Annie was puzzled to know of his whereabouts. She had felt sure that he would call sometime that evening, but instead, he had gone off without one word. What if he should not return until Sabbath evening? She felt somewhat relieved at the idea of being released from making known- her intentions, if such should happen, but otherwise she had determined to brave the difficulty through. That night was passed by her on a sleepless pillow. But as the grey streaks of morning began to roll them- selves in their-rosy bed, she fell into a deep sleep, from which she did not awake until long after sunrise. Anoth- er long wearisome day was passed, unprolific of relief to Annie's anxiety. She had not had the courage yet to speak to her father on the subject nearest her heart. They had met at the table, but only a few words passed between them. Mr. Bacon was exceedingly taciturn, and his looks were so cold and repellant that the poor girl trembled when she thought of introducing the subject. Saturday evening drew on her golden robes of harvest, commingling with the verdure of Summer, tinted by the sunny rays, as they began to lengthen, and lose their dazzling glitter, as their master source receded from view. Mr. Sumner had preached a warm' discourse that C ay and had returned to Mr. Cranmer's to spend the night with him. As the Brother had urgent business out on a distant plrtidn of his farm, he excused himself, furnish- ing his guest with a good book, so he was left alone. He began a perusal of the work, but owing to the influence of a more engaging subject, he could not fix his mind on the pages before him, his thoughts reverting to M---, in spite of effort. He felt like he ought not to have left - tihere so hastily, and this conviction only increased his, reflection. In vain he essayed to define the cause of 'his uneasiness, but it seemed more unfathomable 'thi. before. He took out his watch to see what -   .   THE INIVESTIGATION.       3 time it was. The sun, though apparently mingling with the forest trees, was full two hours high. He resolved at once to go back to M--, and return the next morning. A servant just then passed through the yard. Mr. 'Sumner asked him if he could bring out his horse. He replied in the affirmative, so in less than five minutes Mr. Sumner had left, sending apologies through Mrs. Cran- mer, to the host. As he jogged along over the seemingly interminable hills, and through the passes between these mountains, he began to reflect on his hasty decision in going back to M--. He felt like there was no good news to greet him on his return, but the four weeks had been an event- ful month to him, bringing a succession-of gloomy vicis- situdes, so that disappointments were not strangers, which consideration, made him feel willing to meet them again, if necessary, but he had no idea of their depth. His first thought on reaching the place was to go to see Annie. And before he was hardly amvare of what he was doing, he found himself at Leander Hall "Is your Miss Aln iie at home?" he asked the servant who came to answer the summons at the d6or. Yes she was at home, wondering why he staid away, but the servant did not tell him as much. A whispering footstep was heard in the hall, and in a moment a being in fairy apparel glided noiselessly in the room. You have been away, may I ask where?" was her first enquiry, after the customary greetings were over. "To the country, dear Annie," he replied affectionate- ly. "You remember I had an appointment out at the Springs to-day." At the word " dear," she almost trembled, for she. knew that soon that right would be taken from him, and the appellation from herself. "Indeed I had forgotten-but no wonder, since I have been so occupied." "With what dearest?" She shuddered. Oh if he would suspend such endear- ing names!  "I have hardly courage to tell you, but I must,' she replied with a faltering voice, while her cheeks were of ashen hue. . :, ,i:  \'  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC8270-00000169"/> 832      L ANTDER HALL. "What is it dearest? tell me! can I assist you?" he asked rapidly, apprehending something unpleasant.  He took her hand in his own gently, and looked in her sorrow-cast countenance with commise'ation and astonish- ment, at the woe-begone expression that played thereon. "Tell me Annie, I beseech you, by the ties between us, by the love I bear for you, and interest I have in your welfare. Tell me and let me console you. Who has a better right than I have? Should not I share your grief? I know it is something terrible! Look at that haggard smile. Oh tell me Annie, right now!" he pleaded the second time. She withdrew her hand, for she felt that it had no right there. A chill crept through his frame. She arose to her feet and began to pace the floor slow- ly. What a trial was before her! There stood the ideal of her heart, with love in every look and expression, watching her in mingled surprise and doubt. And oh! a few words and he would be as far from her as the east is from the west. At last she summoned courage to speak. "Mr. Sumner, in the morning if I am living, and in health, by the grace of God, I intend to do my duty-to pay my obligation to my Saviour, as far as my power goes." He did not comprehend her: she saw it, and was more explicit. "I am going to unite with the Church of Christ, if it cost every-interest I have in the world!" He stood aghast! confounded! "Annie Bacon you know not what you say! Did you not promise"-. "Promise what?"she interrupted him frantically. "Did you not promise Bro. Taylor to drop that matter and become, reconciled?" "No, I made no promise to him. He did not say I did, did he?" she asked in astonishment. "Iot exactly that, but he said that you gave evidence of reconciliation." "And I did Mr. Sumner. When I left him I went to my room in tears. He had worked on my feelings con- siderably. I did not know what to do, and while I was praying for guidance, the words of my blessed Saviour !       I           1TE IN xVESTIGATION.      33 came to me, "If you love me keep my commandments,' and oh! I cannot tell you how forcibly 'it struck me, that all my pleasure while here on earth, must come of doing his will, even at the sacrifice of every kindred tie." "And so you have suffered me to remain under this delusion now for a Whole week," said he reproachfully and sorrowfully. "No, you are mistaken. It was your own fault that I did not tell you. Do you remember last Monday evening? l I tried then to tell you, but you would not give me an - opportunity." "I remember it, but oh! Annie, I was so rejoiced at the tidings given by Bro. Taylor that I did' not notice anything unusual in your appearance. But Annie, you are certainly uot in earnest about this matter. Say that you will revoke it," he pleaded. "No; I cannot. I must forsalke all, all for my Saviour. Oh think what a death he died for me!" "But you have not considered the matter. Need I tell you :that it will blacken every ray of happiness of mine? You know if you join the Baptists we can never be united! The Churches in this circuit where I am lo- cated for the present, will not suffer such a thing. You !   must reflect on this Annie, and revoke that hasty resold  tion!" he imploringly persisted. "I cannot! I cannot! Spare me! I pray you, spare me! I know we must part this night, forever t My HEART is almost bursting at the thought, but oh, do not try to dissuade me from my duty to my Maker! Hie who, when there was no eye to pity, laid. aside his crown, and took on himself our infirmities, and lived a life of poverty and deprivations, and then gave himself into the hands of hisc   ersecutors, and died that ignominious death for me, when he has told me to believe and be baptized, olh! can I dare disobey? Would you have me to do it? Wovere I to refuse, it seems to me that I would justly deserve his wrath aud indignation, to my utter destruction." .  But, Annie, you have been baptized.". I have not!" rang out her voice in bitter but true de. nial of the legality of that miserable attempt of imita- ting the example of Jesus. "I am told that there were a few drops af water sprinkled'iin my face when Hwas an infant, but what has that to do with me now?

Do I deserve better? No! no! If God FI  TW#ere to pour out fire from heaven now and consume me, - I could not justly complain, -for I have trampled his laws under my feet as unworthy of notice, and have embraced I others calculated to weaken truth!"' "4 But Annie, you have not done it knowingly." "And yet I have' had the facilities around me for knowing better. I have neglected my duty until now. And worse than all, I have joined myself to a Society of man's invention, in preference to the Church- of God!" "Annie, you are beside yourself!" he groaned, as he pressed his hand to his head, in deepest agony. No, no; do not say that. You know what I have said is true," she exclaimed, with tears streaming down her cheeks. "But Annie, that Society professes to be the Church of God. I know it differs a little in some respects from the Baptist, but you know we are a free people, and have a right to our opinions." ' You know also that the Catholic Church professes to be the Church of God. What does that prove? As to the right of differing in opinion, you certainly have it from civil authorities, but remember you have no right from God's book, to opinions contrary to the laws which he has laid down. If you have a right to change one or- dinance to suit your convdnience, you have a right to change all, or to set aside all. The baptism of sand is as valid as that of water, sprinkled on the face." "But this is not to the point, Annie. I want ybu to make me one promise here. If you have any love for me, I ask it in the name of that liove. I want you to de- fer this. You do not know what you are. doing. What will your father say?" "Oh, do not refer to that!" she exclaimed, while tears coursed their way down her pallid cheeks. When I join the Baptists, I must leave my home forever!" "Dear, Annie, you alarm me! You . certainly would not, could not, dare do this in the face of such7 opposi- tion-!" he cried, mournfully. - "' He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not  worthy of me.' Can you gainsay that saying? Dare I dis- regard it? What better could I desire than this: 'In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the command- ments of men'? Am I not doing this in obeying the insti- tutions of the Methodist Church? Can you ask me to lay aside my scruples to please a whim of men?" "This is no whim, Annie! indeed it is not. You have been too hasty. I want you to see Bro. Taylor. Perhaps he can convince you of your error. Think of it! Your own happiness, as well as mline, would be blighted! What ; would I have to live for? Have I not toiled unremitting- ly for the last six years, hoping to be worthy of you, and now, just as the cup of joy is placed to my lips, it is dash- ed away! My God! how can I bear this?" and in the agony of his despair, he began to pace the floor also. "Patience, Mr. Sumner! patience! Must I obey man rather than God?" she asked in a tone which sent a death- ly chill to his hopes. "You have been frightened into this, Annie. You should--" "No; no; no; you are mistaken. I know I do not de- i serve anything but the wrath of God, but rest assured the  fear of such has not been the incentive. I love my Saviour, and I want to obey him. How can I trust him implicitly unless I obey him? Look what he has done for me! and see him bleeding on the cross, under the wrathl of the Father, and the curse due man, who helps to drive those icy nails through the flesh of Deity, while Justice stands by and cries, 'Spare him not-the debt is due!' Would you have me to set aside his legal commands, when my sins were cancelled by that blood, poured out by Nature's God, on Vengeance's flames, to quench them ere man was consumed? Add to these woes, scorn! derision! buffet- ing and condemnation! and all he asks, is, 'If ye love me, keep my commandments.' Must I disobey? When I remember that I have been all this time following the traditions of men, when my Saviour has told me to ac- knowledge no law-giver but himself, it almost maddens me with shame and fright. Yea, I have set aside his or- dinances, and adopted such as suited my taste. I have listened to the preachers of his Church, and almost sneer. ed at them, because they claimed to be the Church of Christ. With his Church thus set. before me, I have pre-  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC8270-00000171"/> 36      .L -EANDE. HALL. ferred another of human origin. Oh, Mr. Sumner, if I had ten thousand lives to give now, they would all be given to the cause of my Redeemer, if perchance, there- by, I might make an atonement for my sacrilege. This ls impossible, however Hitherto I have shown no respect  to the Law-giver, but hear me, henceforward I will! Yea, I will remember thee, oh my God, in all thy ways! 'Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respectto all thv commandments.' 'Hold thou me up, and t shall be sate.' Comfort me in this trial, and I shall have no fear," she exclaimed, as she clasped her hands and raised her eyes to heaven in earnest prayer. When she ended, her face was livid, and tears of dou- ble import were coursing their way down her cheeks, pro- fusely. Even amidst that crystal shower, a radiant smile -beamed forth, born of resignation, which, in a degree, ,iafd asunder the fetters of sorrow, and sufeired the Isttrieken soul to bask for a momont in the joy purchased b:WIuch trials. She resumed her seat, with her head slightly inclined forward in deep contemplation. The lovei stood gazing with admiration oti the jewel which was fast receding from his grasp. Once he started as though he would rush from the house, but he hesita- ted and made one more effort. "J Annie, I now make my last appeal. You are aware how the Baptists, as a sect are looked upon by the world; While admitting that they do not deserve ill the censure they receive, yet I never could marry a woman that is so forgetful of propriety as to unite with them." "'Blessed are they which are persecuted for rignteous- ness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' You rmemmber that passage, Mr. Sumner? I love the Bap- tists ten times more, because they have been persecuted and derided by the wdrld." '",But, Annie, I a m not talking about their persecution now. You know I love you, and you know that if you join the Baptists, you are lost to me forever. Now I conjure you by that love, b the prospect of o6ur future happiness, to reflect. Wait one week. Wait until Bro. Taylor can come down and talk with you, and if he fails to convince you of your duty, then I must give you up." ^' I bannot do that, Mr. Sumner.

Miay the Lord bless von for this resolution, but I CANNOT!" and he was gone  gone! gone! Who can describe the anguish of that heart, as she flung herself on her knees and prayed? She did not pray for his return, No! she knew that that, could not be, unless she shouild retract. She prayed because her heart was in (deepest agony. She prayed because she felt that the throne of grce was her only resort. She prayed at Jesus' feei. beenuse he had died for her; and could she have thrown herself at a greater mercy seat? Is there any better place to cast one's soul. Yes, at Jesus' feet, where pitv-was never denied, and succor ever sure! The niight waneed away. The flickering lamp was fast denoting a scarcity of oil. The seven stars began to turn westwaird. and th thorned moon had long since hid her crescent form diep behind the interminable forest. The heroine ofour dreams was still in supplication, not with her lips )but heart.  Soon her faith became increased. She began to feel strong enough to bear any trial, hich her Maker might choose to inflict. A gentle breeze struck up from over the way. The large bay window admitted it welcomely, and it played its frolicsome freaks amidst the soft tresses of Annie's hair. This cooling draught served to mitigate the scorch- ing fever which excitement had created. A more pleas- ant sensation crept over her frame, aided by the holy res ignation, for which she had so earnestly contended.. One glance at the silent, but ever vigilant watchers of night, and she retired. The Baptist Church was full, on Sabbath morning, ere the second bell had announced the hour of worship. And why? It had gone out in M---, that Mr. Weston was to preach a sermon that day, of isolated impor. The people of that town being naturally of an excitable tenm- 29 - . 4 ' Sfe;, - -* Ado  s  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC8270-00000172"/> 338      LEANDER HALL. perament, and also liberal sharers of mother Eve's great. est propensity, turned out almost to a man, to hear what that " strait jacket" man had to say. Even the sensi- tive Mrs. Crow was there, though she did not "hold with going where she was' not welcome." Miss Lankinston also, with a very significantt look, as much as to say,- "You may do and say what you please, but you won't have any influence on me." Every'body had arrived exeept Mr. Weston's family and Annie Bacon. Let us go hither and see what is de- taining them. "Father, I want-" "Go to your room, Annie! You shall not counte- nance such repugnant doctrine! Go to your room I say!" he repeated violently. "But H" "Ill hear no more! if you do not obey me, then leave my house!"And Mr. Bacon, to make the emphasis more forcible,-'stamped his foot andraised his voice to a loud  and unmerciful tone. Poor Annie! there she stood like a heroine, ready for her duty. She had donned her bonnet for Church, and was only waiting to take leave of her father. This she had put off from'time to time, until now, as the last Church bell was ringing, she was standing before her un- relenting parent, to ask his consent to her obeying her Saviour! Mr. Bacon had not comprehended, as the read- er already perceives; he only thought that she wanted to go to Church, but it hever had intruded itself that she 'had any notion ofjoining! "Father," said she, gaining composure, "father, to-day I am going to obey my/Saviour. He has commanded me to believe and be baptized. The latter, I have neglected, but I will, no longer. And now I have come to ask your consent, and to ask you to bless me in this act." "My consent! Never! never! never! Go to your room! What? my daughter join that sect? Never?" he again uttered, in deepest agony, and astonishment. "Father, you will not forbid me, will you?" she asked, in such pleading tones that few could hear but to weep. , 'Yes!" was the unfeeling reply.  : Bt tjudge between us, father; whether it is better to obey God, than man.

There is no longer any tie between us,"and he turned his back, and left the room. Annie was left alone. Her first impulse was to set down-and weep, but the hour for Church was at hand, so she smothered her grief and started. Just as she' reached the door a servant handed her a letter. It was from Mr. Sumner. It was some time be- fore she found courage to read it. She sat down and broke the seal tremblingly. It ran thus:  "DEAREST ANNIE :-Qnce more I plead your attention, ere you take that fatal step, which you are contemplating. You know, dearest, how utterly void my'life would be, were, you' to prose- cute your threat. I trust that last night's reflection has given you a discrete impression of affairs.

You are unprepared for this, Annie, believ me, you are. You have not reflectqd on half the consequences incident to such a step. I would ask you to look at the Baptists in this community.

Remember your friends in H--, how they would reject and scorn you! "Annie dearest, for the last time, I beg you to delay this  matter, until you see Bro. Taylor. See him, and talk with him, for my sake. It may save us, ohe so much grief. Will you bring your old father's gray hairs down to the grave in sorrow? Will you blight the happiness of two, just to gratify a whim? Yes, it is a whim, Annie, and nothing more. There have been as good and obedient Christians, that have lived and died in the 'Methodist Church, as will ever be in any Church. -Annie, think of this.

The bearer of the missive stood by, as if waiting some reply. This reminded her of her situation. '"Mr. Sumner is not at home, is he boy?" "No marm, but he told me to wait till you auswered that letter.", Annie had no time to reply then, but some response must be given, even'if but a word. Mr. Surner must be notified that she was determined in her course. She siezed a pencil, and wrote on the fly leaf ofa a book: "MR. SUMNER :--Your note was received;. I amt now ready to start to Church, as I have not time to make a lengthy reply. I am resolved in my course. I cannot defer the matter. ' See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptised ' "Pray for me. Farewell, forever.    ANNIE." She hastily tore the leaf out, and folded it up, and en- closed it in the same envelop in which her letter came; "then she directed it with the pencil, and gave it to the boy. By this time Mr: Weston and his family were at the gate on their way to Chnrch. She hurried forth and joined them. Mrs. Crow and Miss Lankinston, sat whispering when our-company arrived. "As I live, Mrs. Crow, there she is with them! I'll bet my existence that they will have her a Baptist, be- fore the year is ended," exclaimed 'Miss Matilda- as she spread out her voluptuous-dress to display the large gau- dy boquet of flowers that-were stamped on it. "And I too; please move a little, Miss Matilda, see! the is going to set up in the amen corner! and with his family too! Well, well if I were Bro. Sumner, I would not stand that. "Nor I. She'll make a pretty Methodist preacher's wife!" "It will never be, it is my opinion," responded Mrs. Crow, very knowingly. "Don't you think so?" asked the lady: in a .tone be- traying more interest than she was aware of. "No," was the brief reply. "Why?-what makes you thinl that way? Havettfey had any falling out?" persisted Miss Lankinston. "Not exactly, as I know of, but Idon't believe they will ever marry. ' Hush, Mr. Westonis goingto pr&amp;y. rll tell you all I know some other time;  f, '2-    I -       XL-EANDER HAXaL.     341 4"W'ell do," she insisted, bowing her head, while the man of God offered up a petition for all men. The prayer was ended and the whispering resumed, during the singing of a song. "Do, Mrs. Crow, just look!" "What? what?" That dress Annie Bacon has on." ;   J "Yes; did you ever? What on earth makes her dress so common?  "I don't know, but I know she's got better. And look how pale she looks!" It is her dress-the color don't suit hei'." l"No; she looks the very personification of ill-health. She looks like she is about to cry." Well, she does look badly, and she is -dressed very shabbily to-day, but we must stop talking, for you know what a peculiar people the Baptists are. They had just as soon reprove us as to look at us." The sermon was preached, and many listened for the first time to a defense of close communion. As the sub- stance of it has been already given the reader, we will not give any extracts here, for circumstaices demand that we proceed with haste. An opportunity was given for any one who wished to- unite with the Church. The brethren sang a hymn, and ere the second stanza was through with, Annie walked up and gave the preacher her hand! Who can describe the astonishment manifested among the Methodist population? Suspicions had been rife, but realization had not been dreamed of! "Well,'Iknow Bro. Bacon won't stand that!" ex- claimaed Mrs. Crow, in a whisper to Miss Lankinston. And Bro. Sumner? what will he do?"', "They'll never marry! that's what." "I don't think he'll lose much, for to tell the truth, Sister Crow, between you and me, I never thought that they would suit. There are other girls in M-- who would suit him better," and the veritable Miss Lankin- ston almost smiled as-she imagined such probabilities. "So I think; but hush. She is going to tell her ex- perience now."- Mr. Weston had requested Annie to place before the Church her condition as a child of God, and her feelings with regard to the Church of Christ.

In clear and unfaltering tones, she began, and told them, why she requested baptism, and why she preferred tle Baptist Church. One extract here! I cannot believe that any other Church is the Church of Christ," said she in conclusion, "therefore I do not ask membership with any other. I have seen from-history that all Churches now existing but the Baptist, have been set up by uninspired men, and some by men, un re- generated, as was the Methodist Church of which I have' been a member. Also, I have seen front the Bible, that there is but one true Church of God, and the Baptist, is the only one which I can trace by history and the Bible, as being that Church. All other societies fall short of the divine model. Believe me, my friends, it has cost me no slight effort to take this step. I have combatted with every conceivable obstacle in the world, and now to-day finds mebefore you; if you think me a worthy subject, accept me into the Church."  In spite of Mrs. Crow's prejudices, she could not push back' a tear, at the sight of the young girl standing there, almost -lone in the world! Miss Lankinston was too much rejoiced to feel any pity, for she felt now, that Mr. Sumner and Annie would be sure not to marry. But to the subject. It was agreed that she should be received into full membership of the Church after baptism, which was to take place at three o'clock in the Creek, close:by. The congregation broke up without further excitement, only the sermon, furnished food for the reflection of the thinkin$ men of M- , at least to all that heard it. ' Well, did you ever?-Go with me home, Miss Matil- da, and let us talk this matter over. Did you ever hear of anything to beat Annie Bacon's assertion there to-day, in the presence of so many intelligent Methodists, who knew better?  "What, Sister Crow. I did not hear it?" (No wonder, when her whole thoughts were taken up with the pros- pect of other events.) "Why, she actually said that the Methodist Church was nothing but a society set'up by men, and unregenerated men, too! I w6nder where on earth she ever imbibed such an  idea from. I'll-bet a thousand, that Mr.'Weston put her tup'to saying it, concluidQd the corpulent'madam, as she and Miss T;ankinston;pur-ued their way home.   -a         THE INVESTIGATION.        343 "You don't say so! I wish Lhad heard her, I believo l should have repudiated it right on the spot. Poor igno- rant thing!" "Yes, she is to be pitied, but such talk just suits the Baptists. No doubt she'll be rewarded for her pains. Did you notice how delighted the members seemed when she joined? I felt like choking some of them!" "Well, as for my part and share, I don't think they have anything to be crowing over." "Nor do I, but I wish Annie had staid where she was.   It would have looked more sensible in her, at  , ' least." "Yes; but I don't care, let her go. We can do with- out her, I know." "But just think where she has thrown herself! There are not but two respectable Baptist families in M--, all the rest are poor. Annie will have to mix with them, she won't dare come in our circle." "No, I hope she will keep herself to herself."  By this time our female friends had reached home. Annie did not dare to return home, from Church. She was prepared for this externally, but the young heart which had never been accustomed to such bitter cups, almost sank under this sorrow. She wept bitterly as she was forced to pass her own home, seeking an asylum elsewhere. "Don't greve so Annie," said Mollie Weston, as she wards her home. "It will all come right, yet. Trust to Providence. Is there no happiness in doing your duty? Does not your conscience feel easier between your Maker and self, than it did before?" "Yes, Mollie, there is indeed a consolation in what -you speak of, which does in a great degree ameliorate my troubles, but I am but mortal, and very weak. My strength almost deserts me at times." "That, dear Annie, is because you do not trust implicit- ly to your Redeemer. I am afraid you are depending on your own strength, to some extent. Do you remember' the consolation, My grace is sufficient for thee'? Then can you, with such blessed assurance, doubt?" "1 know, MoUie, I am given to the fault just described, somewhat, yet I know there is no power in myself, only as it is granted."   &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC8270-00000175"/> 844       LEANDER HALL. "Well don't talk about it any more now. Here come into my room, and prepare for dinner," said the sympa- thizing girl, as she gently led her friend into her own apartment, which contrasted considerably with the splen- did rooms of Leander Hall, yet it was comfortably fur- nished, and neat enough to suit the most fastidious. Annie was 'now left alone in Mollie's room, to her sad reflections. Previously to leaving home that morning, she sent such articles, by a servant, to Mr. Weston's, as she would rieed that evening afterfbaptism. Also she left her trunk so it could be conveyed to her without trouble, if her father persisted in his threat, for she knew that he was very obstinate in his character, but she couldc not thoroughly believe that he would execute such judgement as he avowed, when the first rupture took place between them. She still entertained hope of being permitted 'to enjoy the parental roof, consequently she had left her trunk at home. 4                * CHAPTER XXIV. ANNIE BACON IS BAPTIZED, ACCORDING TO COMMAND! WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT:  "By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep tHis cormmandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and His com- mandments are not grievous."-1 John v: 2, 3. AT three o'clock precisely, the old Church-bell began to awake its reverberation, as a signal for the administra- "   ,             .   H "   THE INVESTIGATION.        345 tion of baptism. Mr. Bacon sat in his study in gloomiest thought, and when the first notes of the heralder swept through the air he was startled from his revery, for it occur- red to him that it was for his daughter's baptism! He did not have the moral courageto go 'aid si atch her from the watery grave, for he was conscious that such an act would be flagrant antagonism with Christ'sspower. But he had the courage to say that he would never see her again! He started from his chair, as if stung by conscience to the quick. He paced the floor in mental agony, and in- wardly imprecating those who first disturbed religious sectionality in his town, forgetting that he was the first instigator of such a thing. f '  A servant entered to ask leave to go to the baptizing- but the only consolation she received, was the door closed in her face, and an unpropitious scowl. She beat her re- treat hastily. It was well that she did, for had it been a dying request, it would not have been granted.  "What? let any of my family go to see her dipped like a mud-turtle, and against my will too? No; never  Let her go, and see where her hard-headedness will lead her. There is no pity here for her, for she is to me now as a heathen and a stranger. I will forget her!" he con- cluded, with great strength. Go with me reader to yonder gurgling cascade, that winds its way through meadows and vallies, and finds at last a bed into which to disgorge itself of its pearly liquid. The grand Ohio takes in at one breath, the Ash creek, the ideal of our dreams. No matter how many mountain rills help to form this creek, it rolls its fragile body into this gulping monster, scarce furnishing it with one draught. Upon the gradual sloping banks, close on the margin, may be seen a large concourse of people, engaged in worship. A prayer is being offered by an aged minister, ere the flood is parted, in obedience to command. And then a hymn, as if wafted by angelic chorus, floats away on the breezes, accompanied byt the mur of theflow- ing brook. Look! A young girl comes trustingly to the water's /edge, and smiles amid tears as she is led down into the liquid grave. Ah, lovest thou such a scene? See!  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC8270-00000176"/> 346  Y    LEANDER  HALL. she looks toward heaven, as if in prayer. Confidingly she clasps-her hands. Doubt thou stich religion? Be- hold!-In obedience to the 'COMMAND OF OURn LoRD JESUs CHRIST, she is BURIED WITH HM BY BAPTISM, INTO DEATH: THAT LIKE AS CHRIST WAS RAISED UP FROM THE DEAD BY THE GLORY OF THE FATHER, EVEN SO SHE ALSO SHOULD WALK IN NEWNESS OF LIFE. What a scene! Has sprinkling or pour-  ing half the solemnity or sublimity as attends this act? No. Nothing but the true footsteps of our Saviour can awe- inspire. Vain effort of man's. Substitutes become ridiculous and base, when drawn in comparison. Ah! when we stand at the water's edge, and behold those who desire to follow the meek and lowly Jesus, tears, tears of JOY and sorrow too, invariably fill our eyes. We weep for those who repudiate our Saviour's command, and re- joice for those who obey, even in tears! , Annie was baptized, as commanded. There was no ostentation about the scene, but a sensation of respect prevailed, which the imitation could not produce. Mrs. Crow, with her friend Miss Lankinston, were there, to mark the indecency of the act. But their de- signs were thwarted, for the beauty of the sceie, togeth- er with the solemnity, made them forget scrutiny, and even the invincible Miss Lankinston was forced to shed a tear, and we imagine, felt some little compunction, and envy of the young heroine's fortitude. Wonder if she was reminded of the miserable imitation of baptism which was practiced on her not long before? A few drops of wa- ter to represent the burial of our Saviour! and it applied to the head! Does Paul, in speaking of having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, does he say, our heads were washed only? No. 'Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies (the term body denotes the whole frame generally; it never means the hand, or foot, or head, when used to represent a part;) washed with pure water." Miss Lankinston had chosen the imitation instead of the real. She, with others, could but- see and feel the contrast. Would that every one who has suffered the imposition of pontifical decrees to be their portion, could summon the courage to throw off the yoke of rantism, (spriiikling aind tyranny go hand inand,) and obey full   Jh 6     THE INVESTIGATION.        847 our Saviour, instead of vain traditions of men! What a glorious epoch it would be in history! Once let Pope Stephen's law be repealed, and hierarchical Babylon could no longer sit in the temple, with her, branch pro- gely, claiming the power that belongs to God alone. Methodists, Presbyterians, and other denoninations who cling to that law, do you know that you are obeying an edict of Romish power? Do you know that you are fol- lowing Pope Stephen's command, in preference to Christ's? -to that Saviour's who died for you? Every time water is applied to the head in the name of the Holy Trinity, by sprinkling or pouring, Pope Stephen's power as vice- gerent, is virtually recognized. If you believe us not, go to the pages of history written by your own men, 'nd in thundering tones of indisputable strength, this fact is au- thenticated. And still you will recognize his power over Christ's!"Master, is it 12?" When the baptizing was over, the members of the Church all went up and gave our heroine the hand of fellowship. It was a touching scene, to see a young girl tear herself away from home alliances, from wealth, af- fluence, and paternal affection, and cast her lot with God's people, at the sacrifice of these 'earthly sources of happi- ness. There she stood, endowed with the fortitude of a Waldensian, braving the frowns, jeers, and the slander of a thousand female tongues. For what is more severe than the combined artillery of the officious tongue? Like fire in stubble, it devastates honor, sweeps, character, and ma- ligns the fair name, without mercy. Such was Annie Bacon's fortune-a gift of friends. Her conduct was at- tributed to anything but pure motives. Poor girl! what else could have been the incentive? and what should ex- ceed the love for our Saviour? "How do you feel, Annie?" asked Mollie, after the: F baptismal robes had been disposed of, and a muslin dress donned, instead. "Oh I feel happy, conscientiously; but-" "But what? Please don't dwell on the dark side of the picture. Don't let earthly hindrances poison your- happiness. Dearest Annie," she continued, throwing her arms around her neck, "I know you have much to bear, but say, would you exchange your present state of ease, for one of reinstatement in your father's house, debarred from0 doing your duty?"  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC8270-00000177"/> 348       LEANDER HALL. "No, Mollie, I would not. I would not be a prey to unendurable compunctions, for all the wealth of this land, and even the reinstatement of my father's favor, as much as I love him; I am told to iove my Saviour more. I am told to sacrifice all, if necessary, for him. It I obey not, I cannot be accounted as a faithful servant. I feel happy now, though my friends have deserted-"  - "fNay, do not say that, dearest Annie. You have friends still. Those were not your friends, who were so only in days of prosperity, but those who cling to you now. Do you call me worthy of that appellation?" "Certainly, Mollie, certainly. Forgive me; I had ref- erence to my Methodist friends." "Which never bore any love for you, only for the ag- grandizement of self and the promotion of their cause, if they desert you now." "Ion t say that, Mollie. I hope, better of them; some of them, at least."  "Well, I'll not judge-time will decide. Come, let's go down. Yonder is Dr. Boon coming. Wipe away y;our tears, Anlie, and-"  "No, Mollie, I cannot see him. Please don't make such a request of me," pleaded Annie, tearfully. ' But he is a true friend. He has called to console you, so you 1must not refuse to see him," urged Mollie. "I cannot. I cannot entertain company this evening. Go down yourself, and present my regrets," persisted the weeping girl. Mollie seeing that entreaties weire useless, obeyed. She met liil at the door. "I wish to see my friend Miss Bacon also," said the Doctor, as he seated himself. "I am sortry, Doctor, but ciannot prevail on Annie to come down. While she appreciates your kindness, she says that she calinnot see you this evening." "But I am told that she leaves M- in the morning. Shle certainly will not leave without suffering me to hid her farewell. Please ask her, for old acquaintance-sake, to come down," persisted Dr. Boon. Mollie'did as requested, but Annie was inexorable. "Well, present her lmy kindest regards, and tell her that I admire her fortitude." "Which no doubt was condemned by the mass of M 's inhabitants," suggested Mollie.   THE INVESTIOATION,     .  849 "Yes, such is hopelessly the case. But I want to ask you a question. flow is it possible for any one to sum- mon the courage to do what Annie Bacon did this morn- ing? It would certainly be beyond my strength, were it required of me." "That's the point of our differnce, Doctor. Nothing but the Spirit of God, miraculously influencing the heart, can prompt such fortitude. You admit your inability; no wonder, when you are depending on your own works to insure such aid. You deny the Spirit's power, while We : , depend on it. You ignore the main prop of faith. No 4  wonder, when you have never felt its influence. If you :i " had been born, and 'born from above,' you would no longer advocate baptism for remission of sins, but you would then see and feel the value of our Saviour's blood. With the pardoning love of God, you would be enabled to look down on these difficulties as far removed. With- out it, all is dark, all a mystery, which poor depraved man can never solve."  ' Why, Miss Mollie, according to your theory, I would i'.  not be saved were I to die now, and by it you rob Chris- tianity of half of its beauty. This long and hard way of getting religion, which you Baptists have, is enough to put one clear out of the notion of such a thing." "Your first assertion, Doctor, I am sorry to say, I strongly believe. I do not think that baptism has any more to do with the salvation of the soul, than the Lord's Supper." "Then where is the necessity of it, if it is non-essen- tial?" ?   "I do not call it a non-essential. God has commanded it for some purpose. It is foruhis Church, and belongs to it only. As io its immediate design, we won't now in- vestigate, but it certainly has an object. You said some- thing about long and hard way of getting religion. The expression 'getting religion,' is a home-made phrase, and has given rise to many erroneous notions of religion. We cannot get religion, nor do we teach sucfrd 'ine know- ingly.. If the Christian religion and the operation of the Holy Spirit are the same-which no one can doubt-then getting religion,' as it is termed, is not a thing of our will. It is a thing which gets us-which changes the vile heart of man, as directed by God.

Then the merit of salvation lies at his door, and not in Christ's blood. It would truly be a salvation of works-a ' where- of to glory,' because of works." ' But still you have not removed the difficfilty about this hard way of getting religion. I almost shudder at the idea, and if I thought I were compelled to have such religion to be saved, I could not rest day or night." "I n ow, Doctorthere are a thousand vague notions about this, and I can only say, whenever-the heart is willing, and can give up-everything, then the Spirit changes, or works its pardoning love. Whether this state is brought on by God or man, I leave you to judge, but one thing I do know, we are not born 'of blood nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God,' 'who worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleasure.' Allow me to ask you one question. Did you really feel that your sins were pardoned by baptism? You have been baptized and your experience can attest." "I admit, Miss Mollie, I had some doubts, but you know they are incident to the Christian. I have seen those who have been baptized for the remission of sins, die, and die willingly too,! how can you account for that? It strikes me that if they were not prepared, certainly at that hour they would have found it out." "You must remember the Roman Catholic dies in strong faith, and willingly, must we think he has been born again? If I mistake not, they are not regarded as a Christian people at all, even by your denomination. If the Roman Catholic can die confidently and willingly and be lost, (for no one will contend that he is saved But the Roman Catholic himself,) is it not possible and even probable, that a Campbellite may die in his faith and be lost? Behold the Roman Catholic as he dies, with the cross placed before him, and candles lit, to light the soul to the other world. Hear him as he repeats a mystic prayer; accompanied by divers forms and signs, &amp;c. Do you not look on such a one as lost?" Ye s, we cannot believe that he is properly instructed." "And yet you will admit that he dies willingly, with -the imanned, transubstantiated wafer in his throat." "Ye;, lie thinks he will be saved." Y.,h    thn  . hed   THE INVESTIOATIOI.        351 "A nd so the Campbeliite, orjthe one who has been bap- tized for the remission of sins. He thinks he has done his duty, and like the Roman Catholic, dies confidently, and in that fAith. Has he any stronger claims in our es- timation, of being saved than the Catholic? To my no- tion the faith of one, is as saving as the other. People trusting to their religion in the hour of death, is no cer- tainty of its authenticity. The Universalist dies in the faith, forgetful of the Saviour-the only name in heaven or earth by which the sins of men are forgiven-are we to think that he, who rejects the Saviour as the Media- tor, is saved? He dies in faith." "Oh no, Miss Mollie. You do not understand me. Those of whom I spoke died in the belief that Jesus was the Christ." And baptism for the remission of sins?" "Yes, just so." "But I have proven to you, Doctor, that that. argues nothing. A person dying in a faith does not prove that that individual is saved, unless we take the ground that the heathen is saved when dying, blessing the idols of his worship, and invoking their aid; and the Univer- salists by rejecting Christ; the Roman Catholic by his numerous Sacramentaries. Nor could we scarcely find an individual in the town of M-, whether christian or sinner, but would say that he believes that Jesus is the Christ." "Well I see it is useless to argue further on this point now, Miss Weston. I hope at some future time, when I am better posted, I'll be able to refute all your argument, which I cdnsider now as very good. Have a care your- self for the future." I will, but I hope the society will still continue the in- vestigation." "That's what wfe intend doing, but not this week, be- cause the Methodists are going to hold a protracted meet- ing, and Mr. Semms will want to attend" "Tlen I trust you will see this matter as it is, and no longer advocate the fatal doctrine, 'Baptism for the re- mission of sins' for: 'Marvel not, that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

"I see you are determined to have the last word, so I will leave before you double on me. Say to your friend, that I deeply sympathize with her, and am greatly aaazed at her courage and fortitude." Mollie gave an assent to the requisition, and he left with the promise to call again. EHad we time here, we might pry into secrets, which are to be recorded, but we must pass on to other details which require immediate attention. Suffice it to say, Dr. Boon's admiration had not decreased in the least, for the preacher's daughter, upon more intimate acquaintance. Indeed, her affable manners and deserving qualities, to- gether with her uncommon intellect, had called forth from his heart, feelings deeper than mere fancy. But there was an insuperable barrier between their union, she was a Baptist!   . Madame Rumor had busied herself over Annie's case during the short hours of the evening, until every child in M-  became thoroughly acquainted with the partic- ulars, much more the adult population. It leaked out rapidly through the servants at Leander Hall, of her ban- ishment and treatment at her father's hand. Some ap- proved his course, while others of a more lenient nature, upbraided him with deepest censure.   -0'HAPTER XXV. THE-BAPTISM OF SEVEN INFANTS; ONE A BOY OF THRTEEN YEARS OF AGE! THE CIRCUMSTANCE REMNDS U8OF OUR bA- VIO' SAYINO, WHCH Is: "In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrine, the commandments of men."-Matt. xv: 9. MR. TAYOR arrived at M- -, agreeably to expecta- tion, about sunset on Sabbath evening, to assist Mr. Sumner in a protracted meeting. Imagine his astonish- ment when the announcement of 1Annie's exodus from his care, was made. He did not try to conceal his conster- nation and surprise, but with many of the population of M -- joined in and pronounced it a-censurable act. Mr, Sumner was still absent; nor would he return until the next day. It was arranged previously, for Mr. Taylor to preach in town that night, as the beginning of the protracted meeting, and also to administer the ordi- nance of baptism (rantism) to the children before spoken of; so at sunset everything was progressing just as plan- ned, with the exception of Annie Bacon's digressions. What a shame it was that she should cast sich a damper over things uninterrupted by Providential occur- rences. Mr. Taylor could not so easily shake off the incubus, consequent on the late misfortune to his beloved and :highly reverenced Church.  The hour arrived for meeting that night. Mrs. Moore, with seven young hopefuls, together with Mrs. Crow, and Miss Lankinston, all occupied seats approximating as closely as possible to the sacred desk. Mr. Taylor deliv- ered a warm and eloquent discourse, accompanied with heart-rendiqg appeals, and death-bed scenes related in most pathetic strains, a usual preliminary to a protracted meetting. Wio could refrain from weeping, when the 30  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC8270-00000180"/> recollection of departed friends is vividly painted, and their touching appeals portrayed? But did the Apostles preach thus? No. Methinks the mocked, buf'eted and bleeding Saviour was the foremost theme of these di- ' vines. If the agony of the -ross, the bitter anathamas poured on an innocent Mediator-if they fail to reach the sinner's heart, what can be effectual to conviction? Ah! when we remember that cursed tree, which bore a suffer- ing Redeemer that nail wliih .our sins helped to drive into flesh, and the agony felt when he exclaimed: "My God! My God! why hast thou forsaken me?" our hearts almost burst with grief and joy. The Apostles preached Jesus, and him crucified; but most of the preachers now- aday preach up our departed friends, as though salvation was of them. What a contrast! . Yet it is not for us to point the finger of reproof, but the disparity is none the less. .If preachers (Baptists and all,) would stick closer to the gospel of Jesus Christ, instead of eloquent har- angues on foreign subjects, there would be a: diffirent state of things from what is now. The Church of Christ would have less of the world in it, and the soul would seldom be cheated by animal passions.  When the sermon was over, Mr. Taylor announced that there were some infants to be baptized, and request- ed the audience to remain. The request was complied with. First came aeboy about thirteen years of age, in the capacity of an infant of purity; he was the eldest of Mrs. Moore's children. The ordinance was duly admin- istered to him without hesitation, the preacher conclu- ding with a long prayer for the young hopeful's future good. The boy was a spirited and mischievous scamp, and actually had the assurance and indignity to laugh outright while the long and novel ceremony was being performed. This vexed Mr. Taylor somewhat, but still he set the little piece of innocence (a boy of thirteen,) be- fore the congregation as a subject of purity, and an ex- ample of gentleness for the adult membership to imi- tate (!).

We will remember that Mrs. Moore was not a member of the Church, but had been sprinkled in infancy. (A nominal member then.) So" the preacher ended with a long prayer for the parents' speedy conversion. This was strict adherence to the principle of baptizing children on the faith of their parents, and because they are like con- verted persons, gentle, innocent and humble, as the re- semblance between a dove and a child (!). (If the above were a fancy sketch, it might be smiled at, but it was a real incident, happening under the obser- vation of a near relative, whose reliableness cannot be doubted.) Monday morning dawned on. M--   with a mighty rush of events. Annie Bacon was to leave her native town to seek the cold charities of the world. Scarcely had the sun opened its eyes, to gild the spires of the proud Churches of M--, when a boat was seen plough- ing the ruffled bosom of the Ohio, which had drawn on a silvery sheet of morning sunlight. It neared the wharf boat and halted. Annie stood ready to leap on deck as soon as near enough. Mollie Weston was also in company, but she was to take leave of her at the water edge. "Mollie it is almost too much for me!" exclaimed our heroine, as she'threw her arms around her companion's neck, and imprinted a fervent kiss on her glowing cheek. "I know it is. hard to part with every, and the last friend,'Annie, and I would have you stay with'me, but you are unchangeable and persistent in your determi- nation." "Don't attribute it to wilfulness, but timidity. -You know, I could not stay so -near my home, and have its as- sociations haunting me daily. I'd rather work for my bread, than be a prey to such sad remembrances. Oh, I would like so much, Mollie,'to be with you always; but we must part now, and perhaps, forever. You must write often, and long letters, when you learn my address. Take this ring as a souvenir of your friend, and wear it forever," she ended, placing a plain gold ring on her friend's hand, and pressing her to her bosom once more.

The bell gave the signal for departure, and the "walk- ing house " bore that treasure from the scene of her hap- py childhood.  She sought the narrow little state-chamber which was allotted her, to brood over the past, and contemplate the dark future, tremblingly. To our friend Mr. Sumner, let us now look1, alndinform lie reader of his welfare; When he rushed from the rooml on Saturday night, ifi frenzy and excitement he tore ti-i hair, and muttered incoherent sentences all the Way loimle. Previously, he had had sonme dark presentinlents, 1ut not of a determinable form, nor had lie indulged :in ialf so gloomy prospects as reality brought on. By the time he had reached his room, lhe-had grown - somewhat calmer, but only a deep fit o(f melancholy ensued, into which he relapsed, and remained until next mornin, the time for his departure from M- . It never struck :hiin, until ready to leave, that one more appeal niight ac- ,o0mplish ianything. Upon. this thought he acted. He iturriedly drew out of a drawer a small escritoir, and se- lected from its contents a sheet of paper and a pencil. So rapidly did he trace each line in excitement, that he for- got form or system, in the composition. He ignored the art of Belles Lettres to its exclusion, and sought only to reach Annie's heart. We have seen the effect of his note, so we will forbear to dwell on it. The note he entrusted to a boy on whom he could rely and gave directions which we have already seen carried out. Then he mounted his horse and rode hastily from the town. The day was very fine apd pleasant, so a large con- gregation awaited him at the Church, but how utterly unfit was he to address them! His feelings, however, were not consulted, for the "sacred box" was Vacant, and the door openled very naturally for him, through which he walked, 'half unconscious of what he was doing. At night he filled another stand, much against his feel- ings. This was a funeral sermon, which, even if possi- ble, made him more miserable. Once he began to hope for the success of is letter, and oh! what a happy feel-; ing ran over his frame. But when he weighed the cir- cumstances, and found the ballance againsthim, it caused him to relapse into the same solemn mood.  4        same   *   IX      TTNnT  INVESTIGATION.      857 The brethren began to wonder what had come over the usually happy disposition of the young preacher, but all their conjectures could not solve the mystery. They - were unacquainted with the finale of circumstances, therefore his state of depression was unaccountable.   He spent a sleepless night again, alternately of hope and fear. Early Monday morning, he left for M-- , to. learn his fate. Alas, it was written on a fly leaf, of half a dozen lines! and sealed in the same envelope selected from his own escritoir! The boy as directed, had con- cealed it in a book iiThis room. How he trembled -as he traced the dooming sentence of iis fate! And then, a still more unwelcome communication was written in every countenanct he met. Annie was gone! How could he smother sauch grief? He had borne the aiticipation with silent fortitude, but the real- ization, how was it lossible to 'onceal? For he loved Annie Bacon, with his lhlole oearthly affections. Love, true love, covenanted by Deity's approbation, and knit in unison by spontaneous affection, cannot be easily buried. Love, whose motive is only] love, and responded to by con- geniality, can it be concealed by prudential mbtives? We ask each heart that has bowed to this shrine, is it possible for the altar, when once robbed,- ever-to possess such jewels of attraction again? and is it possible for the glory to depart without a pang? Mr. Sumner was so overcome by Annie's sudden de- parture, that he could not, nor would not attend Church that day. Mr. Taylor had too much feeling to insist, but' went alone and conducted the service himself, again. The lmeting progressed fitely.; There was considera- ble excitement gotten up. Night after night a "sanctified row" was gone through with. Death--bed scenes were pictured; horrors of death; and hell depicted as open and ready for all those " who did not come forth and get reli.  gion at once." Mothers rushed-to their tdugliters scream-  ing, and fathers to their sons, hardly conscious of what they were doing. Not a stone was left unturned, to raise? passions, and the young, frightened half out of their senses, rushed to the altar "to get religion," for fear of falling right into perdition! Who can: faithfully des- cribe the scenes that followed?

Ima- gine yourself pulled by one, pounded by another, hugged to almost suffocation by the third, and exhorted by the fourth, and lastly commanded to say "glory!" whether you feel like it or not! What -sensations you must feel under such circumstances! This is the kind of religion that men "get," and lose, and it has-done more for Tom Paine's cause, than he has himself. Can any be aston- ished at the rise of the doctrine, " falling from grace "? That which we can "get," of our own power, we have power to lose; but that which "get " us, we have no pow- er to dispose of. 'The latter is that which keeps us " by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. " At the close of the week, about twenty had joined the Church, some of whom were converted, while others, as seekers. Mr. Taylor stood up the last day, and made an elo- quent appeal to the unconverted. The doors of the Church were open to all such as wanted to go to heaven with the Methodists. Mrs. Dr. Moore, together with her eldest son, joined the Church as seekers. Then the -ordinance of baptism was administered to those who had not been baptized in infancy. Mr. Taylor, to impress the audience with solemnity, went through with the circumstance of his own baptism, thus: 'I was baptized, my friends, in infancy, and I am to this day-satiaUSed with that baptism,; and if it were possi- ble to say so, I am more than satisfied. And I believe, tie ordinance which I am about to administer (which was springling) is one of the Bible.* I regard baptism mfore as a sacrament than anything else, nor do I think it as to modes, a thing to be fussed about. Let our Baptist friends baptize as they wish, and so will we. i(A very re- cent grant.) This is a free country, so let every man wor- ship God according to the dictates of his conscience. We are all trying to get to the same place of rest, (a very popular doctrine) therefore let us lay aside'strife, and work together for the glory of the cause.

There are several already, who have declared their inten-  tion of doing this, will you, my friends, come along and  go with these to heaven?

(And yet, the Methodist is a branch of it.)  "The Methodists have been greatly blessed. Look at the number of our Church! (Infants and all, no wonder, when to one grown person there is an average of two in- fants.) Look how the good old ship is moving along! ' Come, my friends, and join this great branch of God's Church. I believe it is in strict accordance with God's  book to take seekers into the pale of the Church.* Then   I they are placed where they will not be so apt to fall back to the world."  And thus Mr. Taylor, professing to be a Christian, and a man of intelligence, did entertain a people who had the Bible, untrammeled only by Commentaries!  Surely,                          i "Much learning doth make thee mad!" Surely he had forgotten:  "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there  bemno divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined to- gether in the samE mindand in the same judgment!"  Surely, he had forgotten, that the Church of Christ is: "A chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellotus light: Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God." And that the Church "as lively stones, i  are built up a Spiritual house," instead of being mixed with the world, and composed partly of Christians, and partly of sinners.  The meeting closed on Sunday night, having been pro-  tracted a week. The anxious persons were all brought into the Church, ere it wound to a termination.

The week had been long, tiresome, and miserable to Mr. Sumner. He had taken but little interest in the meeting. His thoughts dwelt but little on what was transpiring in M----. Once during the time, he called to see Mr. Bacon, hop- ing to gain some information of Annie's whereabouts, but the plc man refused to see any one, so he was forced to return as he went. He then sat down and penned a iote appealing to the old man's sympathies in his daught- er's behalf, but it was returned unread and unopened! What could he mean? Mr. Sumner concluded natural ly, that Mr. Bacon Was vexed with him because he was not more successful in the discussion, and because he suffered Annie to imbibe such notions as led to her estrangement, so he resolved to let the old man alone. His next resort then was to write to Mollie Weston, though he felt an extreme delicacy in doing so, for they were but partially acquainted, and he did not like to call up old associations by having alliances with that house. However, his love for Annie surmounted these scruples, and he-sat down and implored Mojlie, to give him such informnation as she had. Here he was alike unsuccessful, for Mollie did not precisely know herself, nor was she at liberty to make a communication of what knowledge she did possess. Mr. Sumner was in despair! His last hope was gone. He took no interest of things that concerned, or of those that did not concern him. He was so completely last to externals, that he forgot to go to the prayer meeting the next Wednesday night, and even allowed the Christian Advocate to lay folded on the table, just-as it was from the press!  He had met Miss Matilda Lankinston several times, but  some how he coul4 not appreciate her sympathies, wich abounded to a superfluity. Mrs. Crow's prediction was right, and we really belieye she was glad of it, just for the sake of saying: "I told you so! I am not often mistaken!' But we must not judge.   i       CHAPTER XXVI.

DR. BooN, as he wended his way home that evening  from Mr. Weston's house, fell into a very reflective mood. The conversation with Molhe had given rise to some very serious thoughts, and the motives of Annie Bacon, toge- ther with 5Mollie's application, had made his doubts doubly pungent. Could it be possible that Molhe was right and he mis- taken? Had he not had uninterrupted faith almost fiTm  the time he was baptized, until now?  True,y   -"a'a " doubts about this "baptism for the remissioan; i-f';  had crossed his brain several times, but he had only dto  refer to the Bible for further assurance.  "What!" he exclaimed, thinking aloud as he walked slowly along, "what is all this stuff about the Holy Spirit? Are we not just commanded to believe that Jesus is the Christ, and be baptized for the remission of sins? I wish there wasn't any such a thing as conscience, for it is always making some suggestions to discomfit a body!" he exclaimed again, for just then that unvoiced monitor whispered: "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God, and his sins are pardoned ir- respective of baptism." "But," thought he, "we believe that Jesus is the Christ, therefore we are born of God, when we comply with all his commandments." Again the spirit whispered: "The assent of the mind, and faith are two different things. Devils believe and tremble,but devils do not possess that faith which begets charity."  "Well, well, this is a mystified subject., to me at least, 81  }                      Z:  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC8270-00000184"/> antW      S  dBLEANIDER HMALL. it is. I don't intend to bother myself with it any longer," and he briskened his gait as if to outrun thought, but he was mistaken, for conscience travels faster than the body. It made no difference what his efforts were, to evade these intrusive visitors, still they followed him whenever he would suffer himself to think at all. "What if I am mistaken?" he found himself thinking  again, before he was aware of it. "What if my beauti- ful plan of salvation is a sham after all? If so, how  E many thousands have been deceived!" and he shuddered  at thie thought. "What die like the Roman Catholic, in the belief that toe are to be saved, and all a false impression? I acknowledge I had rather be on the safe side, I had rather be what they call 'born again,' but I suppose it is nothing more than notion after all. - But shaw, shaw, I thought I had abandoned this subject, yet I find myself on it again!"And our hero tossed his, hat in a chair, and assumed a real Kentucky attitude before the fireless grate, while puffing away at a fresh "Havana" with as much vigor, as if life depended on its consumption in a limited time.  Annie Bacon landed in the town of B---  Tuesday evening. She was so bewildered with her forlorn situa- tion, that she hardly knew, what step to take first. She looked around for a hack-or an omnibus, but the meagre supply of public facilities in the -town being in use  already, she was left to the resort of seeking some other conveyance, or perhaps, a pedestrian exercise. She had fortunately taken the precaution before leav-  ing M-  , of ascertaining the street of Madame Morris' school, so after a long time, and with the assistance of a very benevolent looking old man, she procured a convey- ance,- and thanking the gentleman for his timely aid, gave the driver directions for the route, and in a few mo- ments she was ushered in the reception room of a large establishment. Madame Morris met her with the letter, which sheliad written a few days previously, and had been received that day, having been delayed by an inter- ruption in the mails. This letter served as Annie's in-  troduction.. Inclosed was a note from Mollie Wceton; though Annie was ignorant of its contents, yet it was Well. that it was written, for Madame Morris was very   particular as to whom she employed, and always required some recommendation, if it chanced to be a stranger. Mollie Weston had been a favorite pupil of hers for three  years, and when she presented her with the well deser- ed " sheep skin," she could rot refrain from weeping, for she knew she was to lose her best and most exemplary scholar. "Your name I believe is Miss Annie Bacon," said the Madame as she pressed her hand. "That's my name. Now tell me whom I have the pleas- ure of addressing?" "The same to whom Fhis letter is addressed," replied the Madame, at the same time turning the envelope so that her name could be seen.- Annie at once recognized the letter as the one she had written, so she took the Madame's hand again, and shook it warmly, for she had learned to love her already, as such a motherly look- beamed through her countenance. "I am very glad that you have arrived," continued the Madame," for I have a vacancy which I am very partic- ular about being filled, and I feel assured that you are competent, having been raised with the advantages which you have had.'"  Tears gathered in Annie's eyes at the allusion to her former life, for the contrast between then and the pres- ent, forcibly struck her with pain. A few days ago she was the idol of a doting parent, the prospective wife of a worthy man, and natural heiress of a large estate, but to-day found her a cast-off rejected by lover and pa- rent, and begging the charities of this unfeeling world! But it is all for thee, dear Saviour," she inwardly ex- claimed, as the dreadful picture was passing before her. Madame Morris saw that the reference was painful, and forebore further remarks on. the subject. Annie's salary was soon agreed on, then she was con- ducted to the room, which was to be her future sanc- tuary.  She was to cnter on ier duties the next morning, so she was thinking, when several girls, somewhat rude, and true descendants of Mother Eve, peeped in unceremoni- ously at the door, to get a look at the new school-mi3- tress. This annoyed her so that she got up-and closed the door, and locked it. Hence her gloomy thoughts ! -  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC8270-00000185"/> 384       LEANDER   HALL. were unmolested afterwards, until the supper bell r minded her of her- situation. How was she to find the way to Ithe alning room? The house was large, and had many rooms in it, nor had she the least recollection of the number of flights steps she had gone up to reach her room. While thus ruminating on the difficulties, Madame Morris came to her aid. This was akindnesswhich she had not looked for, and a consideration which few would have taken in view; but Madame Morris was not a common woman as to feeling.  Wednesday morning found Annie at the head of a large music class, patiently listening to a bad lesson in the 4"Primnmer." lNotwithstanding it was very labo- rious, it w'as a happy respite from melancholy broodings, to whichl she had been a prey. Day after (day her task was faithfully pertormed, in in- structing and hearing inarticulate auswers from scholars, that could not boast of very deep capacities, together with others more sprightly. At night, weary and worn out, she would throw herself on her couch, and sleep all through the sable hours, which was indeed, a great bless- ing, Here let us leave her and retrace our steps to M--. Miss Lankinston refieshed herself with a cup of tea, and then began extensive preparations for Mr. Sumner! Yes, she llad actually extracted the promise of a visit from the young preacher, but for what reasons, we shall soon see. "The very thing, Mrs. Crow!" she exclaimed, the evening before, as she was about taking leave of her esti- mable friend. "The very thing itself! Send him round by to-morrow evening at all hazards, and I think I can commuiicate intelligence that will interest him." "But, lMiss Matijda, if you know anything, please tell me. I'll give you my word upon honor, that I ll reveal it to no one living. Now do tell me Miss Matilda," plead- ed. MPs. Crow as she drew nearer the speaker, lowering her clarioni voice. "I cannot Sister Crow, until Bro. Sumner hears it. It may not be prudent for me to give the intelligence to any one but him, so please don't insist, but be sure and see him, and tell him that I have something of import- once to communicate, and that 'll be at home on the   THE INVESTIGATION.        865  morrow evening. Now be certain and do this, Mrs. Crow." "I will, though I wish you would tell me now, for I  don't think I can wait."   . "But I can't. Good evening." The above conversation was the cause of Mr. Sum-  ner's visit to Miss Lankinstoln. The clock struck eight; it was just cleverly dark. Miss Lankinston sat under the shade of the lamp, (as usual,) in glorious anticipation. She was the machinator of this scheme, therefore the reaper of its fruits. Mr. Sumner arrived; but she was so engaged in read- ing, that she did not perceive his approach until he, see- ing the door open, had entered.  "Excuse me Bro. Sumner-."  Rather you excuse me. I have intruded unannonnc- ed, but you must forgive this remissness, as there was no obstruction in the way, but etiquette, which I forgot to observe.       -  "Notat all, not at all. I was looking for you."  "Well you might be, for nothing could have detained me, after hearing that you could give me some informa- tion of Miss Bacon's whereabouts," was the quick and warm reply. Miss Ialnkinston did not like such demonstrations of interest in Annie, but this was one of the trials of her life, which she was seeking to subvert.   -- Mr. Sumner was more hopefil. Ah, the prospect of knowing where the objec o of his afections was, raised his depressed spirit higher than he thought it ever pos- sible to be. Though Annie had erred, he loved her none the less. "Dc tell me, my dear Miss Lankinston, what you know about Miss Bacon?" he continued after a slight pause. "Is she where I can see her? Has she left the State?" he asked eagerly. "You are too sanguine, Bro. Sumner; why do you suppose that I know of her exact wheireabouts?" ' Oh excuse me!" he said, his spirits falling into dis- appointment. I'was certainly informed that you could tell me all about it." "You are mistaken. I thought I could put you on her track perhaps."  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC8270-00000186"/> S66     sF -LEANDEBR HAL . Then do that," he pleaded, willing to gain any infbr- mation possible. "' only know that Miss Bacon went up the river. Early Monday morning, I was awakened by the whistle of a steamboat.- I arose and went to a window, where I had a full view of the river. That boat was going down the river. It halted only a moment and then pass- ed on. In a few seconds, another came along, going up the river, and I then saw Miss Bacon and Miss Weston standing on the wharf. Miss Bacon was ready for    -. traveling. I know she embarked on thlt boat, for there  was none other until the evening, and she was gone, so it was circulated, before ten o'clock in the morning. This is all I know." Mr. Sumner was sadly disappointed. The information was-of but very little worth to him. For aught he knew, Anlinie might have traveled on to New York, or to Can- ada. He thanked Miss Laukinston, however, and was about rising to leave, but the second thought told him better.  "I think, on the whole," continued the lady, "that it was a very imprudent act, and justly deserves the con- demiiation of every sensible one in the State. To think that she would so far forget propriety, as to run off un- protected, and no one knows where-." "You forget the cause, Miss Lankinston," interrupted the young preacher, in a tone of slight reproof. "Take it to yourself. If your father were living, and should close  his doors on you relentlessly, would you not leave the lo- cality, and go far from such painful associations? How  could our friend Annie Bacon stay in M- , when the parental roof of her childhood was denied her?" I know that is a consideration, Bro. Sumner, but had she. behaved herself in the first place, this need never have been."  Why, what did she do?" "Nothing but join the Baptists, yet I think that is suf- ficient cause for banishment from her father's house, whel  his principles were so contrary, and he was so opposed to . her taking such a step. Children should obey their .pa- rents."  "That's very good argument in its place, Miss eahkin- ston, yet you must remember that it was a matteriof c'bn-    science with our friend, and she felt it her duty to obey God first, as commanded. I know it grieves me to give her up, but if she could not stay where she was, contented, it was best for her to join another Church." "Indeed, Bro. Sumner, you are more lenient on that 'close sect' than I thought you to be." "I do respect them more than formerly." "And will join them because Annie Bacon has," she  suozested, maliciously.  "No no, never. You mistake me. I love the Church that I am in, too well for that." This mollified Miss Lankinston's chagrin, somewhat, i and she continued in a more pleasant strain. "I am glad to hear you say that, for we would not lose you for any consideration." "You have no room for such apprehensions, were you desirous of such a thing. But I must go. Good even- ing." "Stop, Bro. Sumner. Don't be in such a hurry. You don't call so often that-."  "I have an engagement to-night at nine. You will have to excuse me this time., It is nearly that hour now." "Tlen if you will go, call again, and perhaps by then, I'll know something about your friend." "I thank you." And he was gone. If any one had seen the peculiar leer that lingered in Miss Lankinston's eye, her motives for such interest in the case would have been questioned. In'fact, we are of the opinion, had she known anything conducive to Mr. Sumner's happiness, she would have been the last to re- veal it. -The young preacher was still in despair. Well could he account now for the dark. premonitory visions which had flitted across his brain, in sleep. A few eeks had - drawn their cumbersome moments over him working the  eftects of so many years. Time had breathed but a short breath, yet his work was no less manifest. A few weeks! and look at their footprints! A few weeks, andathe su- perstructure raised by four years of hard labor, is leveled with the dust! Ah! indeed: "Man proposes; God dis- poses." Mr. Sumner returned to his lonely sanctuary, still deep er immured within the grasp of settled melancholy.

Bt the old man refuses to see any one. Hlowever, 'll consult Bro. Jones, as to the best expedi- ency." So he banished .the subject from his brain, for that night. Early next morning he held a private conversation with Mr. Jones, his host. "1'f you could chance to-" 4"B4Ut he never leaves his house," interrupted the impa. tient lover, as Mr. Jones was at work in planning and sugesting. "Couldn't you manage to gain admittance by-" "Oh, as to that, any one is admitted into the house, but not into .his room," interrupted the anx:ous lover, again. "Yet I think if you would persist, you might possibly get to see him." "If yo. would only go-" "I beg to be excused from such a task, Bro. Sumner. I am willing to serve you in any way that I can, but H-" "Go with me, then!"          . "What if-" "No ifs, nor ands about it. I cannot go there alone." "Yet you are. the proper one to go, Bro. Sumner. Nor would you wish any one to be present when you talk with himn. Go alone, and peremptorily demand to be shown tolhis r'oom. When once in his presence, he certainly cannot have the heart to turn his back on you." "If you say that, Bro. Jones, you do not know him as well as I do. He is a man of very excitable tempera- meui;t and when aroused, forgets propriety and prudence totally. Yet, if you will not accompany me, I'll make one more effort, for Annie's sake," he ended in a despon- dent torle. According to his resolutions he acted. Half an hour afterwards found him on the familiar road to Leander Hal. What associations connected with the surrounding sceneriy trooped to his memory. IIis heart was stirred by a- tumult of painful emotions. Irresistably he halted under the grand old oak, which iad ii lays of yore, been a favorite trysting spot with him aid Annie, and which had often screened the search-   THE INVESTIGATION.       369 ing rays of the summer sun from them, when at mid-day they had sought its inviting shade. There too, close by, was the aromatic honey-suckle, from which he had plucked many a careless sprig, to place in the hair of the queen of his heirt. Still on the ever-green, there was a scatter of bloons, but the surrounding scenery was so  gloomy, that this blooming remembrancer seemed but a mockery. A monthly rose bush hard by, as if to keep up a cheerful appearance, had persuaded one of its off- spring into blooming, but such a stillness prevailed around, that it began to grow pale and to scatter its tinted leaves. Mr. Sumner gave the bell-rope a feeble pull, for his heart had failed him, under the weight of painful revery, and consequent misgivings. In several moments a servant answered the call, but - only opened the door partially.  "Boy, can I see Mr. Bacon?" he asked, trying to as-  sume as much bravery, in his tone, as possible. "Well really, Massa Sumner, (the boy scratched his pate) I don't-can't-but, but-."  "That's enough, Tom, show me in. I must see your  master on some very important business." And Mr.    I Sumner, hardly conscious of what he was doing, pushed the boy forward, until they arrived at Mr. Bacon's room. The door being unlocked, he opened it and walked into  i the presence of Annie Bacon's stern and unrelenting fa- ther! Imagine the old man's astonishment and chagrin,  at that unexpected intrusion! He left his seat.  "Your pardon, Bro. Bacon," said'Mr. Sumner, advanc-  -ing towards him and holding out his land.  A frown was the welcome. Had there been any ef-  frontry in 'Mr. Sumner's composition, that scowl would  have given it a death-blow! The cause being desperate, Mr. Sumner assumed an imperturbable external, and pro- ceeded; yet the while his heart was leaping, as if threat-  ening its- ounds of pulsation. "L have come once more, Bro. Bacon, to entreat your sympathies, or at least try to do so."  Mr. Bacon was silent, this gave the young preacher courage.                         "Your daughter, your only child, is now under the. - i roof of some uncharitable-."'  "AND WHO BROUGHT HER THERE?" thundered the old  - man, as he gazed on his visitor nnflinchingly.   &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC8270-00000188"/> 870      LtANDSt tALL. Mr Sumner was thrown off of his guard by such an unexpected accusation, or its equivalent.. "Yu cannot lay the charge at my door," at length he replied slowly. "Yes sir, on You rests the whole cause." '"Explain yourself." "Had you defended our cause properly, and not let that Baptist preacher dislodge you so, my daughter (here his voice faltered) would have been at home now, enjoying the sweets of an easy conscience. "I ask you plainly, sir, do you think it was in my power to doit? I had no Bible to suit my purposes. (He forgot that the Bible was translated in his favor.) Under the circumstances, I did the best I could." Mr. Bacon knew that this was true, therefore he was puzzled for an answer. At length hle walked in front of his visitor,; and said: "You've come here, this the second time, to annoy me. Through your instrumentality I am cursed in my old age. Had son convinced my daughter of her error, none of this would have been. But--." "You nmis,-." ":Not a word from you. I knew it would come to this. Any fool :could have seen it ra month ago. Why did you everstrt this thisng?" he fasked with great physical strength d             gra iYou forget, sir, that you were the starter; of it your- self" replied Mr. Sumner quickly, and rising to the floor. Mr. Bacon's memoi-y was recruited., There was a brief silence, and Mr. Sumner spoke again. "I did not come here to revert to the past, nor to re- suscitate memory in its painful irealities' but sir, I came to remind you of your exiled daughter. By the lovre you bore her mother, and even herself--in these considera- tions I entreat you to recall her, though she has errecd," was the earnest appeal. Mr. Bacoti beg4an'to6'walk the floor. Hie had becomre greatly agitated. His eyes flashed fire of ange1r. Jis  countenance was livid, and the thin loo'selips which car- ried so much expression of dislike when crossed, literal- ly seethed in wrath. He strode the floor with increased rapidity, then he paused in front of his unwelcome visi- tor a-nd -said:                 - r v        w   w    ]A    THE INVESTIGATION.        371 "You would have me take to my bosom an adder; to spoil my interest; you would have me encourage a fa- natic, and tear down my own cause for the gratification  of a whim. My daughter, what is she to me now, that I should sacrifice our great cause for her? She has re- belled, let her see her wrong and return. Whenever you can persuade her to renounce that unpopular, and disgraceful sect, then she can come back to my roof as my child; till then, things must remain as they are. I do not wish to have a difficulty with you sir, so to avoid it, the boy can show you the door." Mr. Sumner saw that the case was hopeless, so he withdrew, according to the hint given, and sought his own home, with a heavier heart than when he left it, if possible. Preacher Sampson had returned, rich! The streets of M1 --- could hardly contain him. He now sported an extra gold chain, and a large finger ring on the wee finger! Also a suit of doeskin cloth formed an unusual habiliament worn with much grace. A bran new beaver  hat, placed "slantindicularly" on his head was another  additional sign of his late inheritance. Invariably, as he met his friends, the hand with the J mass of gold went foremost to greet them.       - Dr. Boon was strolling down Main street slowly on Saturday evening, when friend Sampson hailed him. Where to Doctor? Stop my friend!" "Bro. Sampson, if I am living!" exclaimed Dr. Boon,  I seizing his hand. "Yes, once more in M- ." "And the right man in the right place!" "Why so Doctor?" he asked with some apprehension.  "Because we want your assistance next week"-  "In what?" he asked quickly, not giving Dr. Boon time to finish out his sentence.  "In the same old matter on which you left us. We  have been getting along slowly, but none the less event-  fully."  "Why, hasn't Weston given over yet?"  "No, but Sumner has." - "Sumne?!! "Yes, he flew the' track before Mr. Weston was  through with him. I don't think I ever felt as sorry for a fellow in my life."

"Is it possible that he could not kill close communion  at one blow?"  "Yes it is possible. It did more towards killing him,  than he did towards it's destruction."       1 Mr. SampSon was silent and foreboding. There was no way now of getting around^ taking a part in the dis- cussion, unless to acknowledge at once his inability to defend his cause, this he knew would be very detri- mental to their interest, so he concluded to brave the  storm, and risk the consequences.  "Will you take a part in the continuance of this inves- tigation, Bro. Sampson?" asked Dr. Boon, after giving the preacher time to think on it. "Certainly, certainly, if my business don't push on me too much. You see, Dpctor, there is alarge income to which I have to attend regularly,' so that I have not much spare time." "Oh this won't interfere with your time much, we  only occupy about three hours daily. You must be sure Bro. Sampson, to h'elp us out." "Yes, yes; I'll be with you. When do you meet again?"  "Next Monday morning."  "All right with me. I want to put down these false  notions about the Ioly Spirit, and the accompanying  rigamarole, which has done so much harm. Now will  be a good time for it." "Yes so it iwill, but tell me candidly Bro. Sampson, do you think you will triumph?" "There can be no shadow of doubt about that. Are you going up in town? If you. are, come go with me." "No, excuse me, I am on my way home. :Good even- ing, and remember Monday morning." ,'*   CHAPTER XXVII. THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES IN WHCH PREACHER SAMPSON ENGAGES. MR WESTON PROVES THAT,  "Be that believeth on the Son,I hath everlasting lfe."- John iii: 84.                         Two weeks had flown-just two short breatls of time, in which sclemes of finesse, and artifice'had been framed and formed, as ligaments of changes, and effects in usury- of the mother of age. What a panorama looms up in mental vision, when taking a retrospective view of things incident to life! The finger of fickle fortune, and ster- ile nisfortune can be traced along the walls of the past, in painful reality, annihilating the preconceived ideas of fiction. 'Twere better had fancy been a larger part of life, than stern reality. Thenmany a pain, sorrow, and pang of grief, and acute pricking of conscience, would have beenspared, and only flitted with this firy-like corn- panion, out of the grasp of man's pllilosophy. It is indeed a vaili boast of this being, that he can per- suade facts into mystical import, when they, like swords dipped in refiactory composition, are opening gashes wide and long, in, the recesses of the past, which ulti- mately reflect on the ' outer man" this saddening truth, undeniably stamped on the heart's tablet of impressions. Mr. Sumner had essayed time and again to be recon- ciled to his fate, courting belief in fiction, and fancy, yet the cold steel of'the past, sullen and perverse, and as equally real, would ever press its whetted blade against this craved obliviousness, leaving the soul restling still, with this, great trial. Soon his face began to reflect his inward thoughts. Paleness, haggardness, vacancy, and restlessness,. constituted an infallible index to his sur- charged bosom, producing unmistakable evidence of the destructive worm which was preying on his vitals. He wandered about, day after day, looking like a shadow of  his former self; taking no interest in things around him. t--3r9  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC8270-00000190"/> 874       LEADE R HALL. /              -  He could not be persuaded to attend the progression of the investigation, though waited oil by a solicitous depu- ty to that effect. IIis appointments were seldom filled, and his failure in health attracted the attention of friends, who began to advise mental and physical recreation, which to him were strangers, while ignorant of his love's where- abouts. Nevertheless, he was prevailed on to leave the town, for the country, to try the virtue of the salubrious atmosphere, unclouded with the fumes of obnoxious gas- es. His sister lived about twenty miles from M--; thither he repaired to pour in her sympathetic ear, his- tale of woe, and seek condolement, which only a fe- male can give. But his seclusion did not lessen his per- severance in trying to find-the resort of Annie Bacon. Every effort was put on trial, and taxed to its greatest extent, yet allall were of no avail. With the rural scenes of happy childhood around him, in mockery to his forlorn state, let us leave him, and the further recital of his untiring researches, for the present.  Monday morning, after the intermission of two weeks, our disputants were so fortunate as to meet again, but this tinie at Mr. Weston's house, instead of Mr. Bacon's, the latter being closed to all visitors. Dr. Boon was very industrious in the cause, for now Mollie Weston (the one above all othlrs whom he wished to please,) was present. And then he was still under the impressions of theseveral little disputes which he held with her, remembering at the same time, the acknowl- edged advantage that she had gained over him. These considerations proved a powerful incentive to his, appre- ciative powers, and caused him to be sure in procuring preacher Sampson's aid in the defense of the cause. So when the little party met, Dr. Boon was the personifica- tion of anxiety. Can you blame him, reader, when so much was at stake? Preacher Sampson began to scratch his head when he was called on for proof of his asertion, which was:  "CG!stian baptism is for the remission of past sins." "The main proof text, is: 'Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Ho- ly Ghost.' Can anything be plainer, sir? Unless you tear that passage, together with others, from the Bible, -   ,.   THE IN-VESTIoATXON.        75  my proposition is irrefragibly established. The fact is, the thing is so simple, that it admits of no other construction. You know Mr. Weston, that Presbyterians, Episcopali- ans, Baptists, Methodists, and all other denominations, have handled that passage, and their efforts combined, have been inefficient in explaining away that command so pregnant with the salvation of our fellow creatures." "Your pardoni," interrupted Mr. Weston, "I hope you  will do me the justice of not accusing me of trying to explain away any command of divine origin. A thing, P'1 give my word upon honor, that I never presume to do. I know the passage just read is plain and unfigura- tive, but I only contend that you have placed an incor- rect construction on it." "That might be said, if the language did not favor me, but it so plainly says: 'Be baptized for the remission of your sins,' &amp;c., that no other construction could be placed on it." "But allow me to ask you a few questions, which per-  haps, will throw some light on this subject. You remem- ber, when our parents partook of the forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden, death was the penalty." "Oh yes, but what has that to do with baptism, or any thing else concerning our day?" asked the preacher, jumping to his feet with a glow of exhileration, and a smile at what he thought, Mr. Weston's ignorance. "It has nothing to do with baptism particularly, though it is not foreign to, the subject. After the transgression, you remember, our parents were left for a while, (history  does not say how long) without a hope?" "Yes, Adam and Eve were left under a consciousness of their awful sin, and the prospect of death and destruc- tion staring them in the face, and their posterity forever, until the Messiah was promised, which was that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head, then there was a hope for their redemption after death," said the preacher, anxious to display his learning. You are right, Mr. Sampson. Since we agree so far, let us proceed and see how 'far we can travel hand in  hand. You say the Messiah was promised then, now will you also concur with me in believing, that it was on the merit of his interposition, or the anticipated shedding of blood, that Adam and Eve, and all others who trusted in the Lord's promises, were saved "  &#xD;<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC8270-00000191"/> 376      L: EANDER H ALL. "Oh certainly,certainly. The patriarchs and prophets all looked to hi, coming by faith, and were saved, as Abraham was, and in fa',t, all who believed on the com- ing of our Saviour; that is, his sin offering has ever been the source of man's redemption." "Very well., You admit then, that it is through the merit of Christ that men are saved?" "Yes sir, for we are told that there is no other name given in heaven or eart'h, whereby men are saved. We are told that he interposed in the behalf of man, when there was no eye to pity, and when the wrath of God threat- ened this disobedient creature with everlasting punish- mont." "Then man's salvation is a gift, purchased by Christ." "Just so." "And of course a salvation of grace, for what has man done to ensure his salvation? Man incurred the debt and Christ paid it. In the first dawn of his sinfulness. Justice stood ready to cut him down, for the debt of sin could not be paid by himself. At this crisis, Jesus Christ looks on with a pitying eye, and steps between the in- sulted God and mau, and oifers to pay that debt, which he did on Mt. Calvary.. Now, is not man's salvation, a salvation of free grace?"  "So we are taught to think," replied Mr. Sampson ra- ther thoughtfully. "Then the patriarchs aid prophets, and those that were saved prior to Christ's advent, were saved, as you must admit, by grace through faith." "Certainly." "If the planrof salvation is of grace through faith, and if Abraham, Moses and the prophets, were saved by grace through faith, and without baptism, so must we, of this dis- pensation, or our salvation is made a redemption of bodily works, and not a gift of grace! You have already admitted, that t itis by grace, throuh faith that we aresaved, saved if we are pardoned, and if pardoned, it is done without bodily w orks, for it is a gift of grace-the new birth, effected only by the Spirit. If Abraham was pardoned by grace, he was born of the. Spirit, and that without baptism. So it must be with us; if we are pardoned, it is by grace, and we, like Christ said, are 'born from, above. If the plan of salvation is of grace, (and you have admitted it)   thben it is: without works. Christ had already paid the  ,debt of works due to God, so far as our redemption is  concerned, therefore, all externtl efrts for ourselves are virtueles3 as to our salvation, because it is already bought." ," Then you make baptism utterly useless, and there.  by,-." "I apprehend you sir; I do not make it useless. While I cannot think it is effectual in our salvation, at the same J time I regard it of much importance. It is a command of Christ, and should be kept by those who love him, be- cause he said, ' If you love me. keep my commandments.' If salvation is enculbent on baptism, of course the - be-  liever is condemned until he is baptized, and it con- demned, how is it possible for him to love Christ so as to keep his commandments, the first being baptism? This is another difficulty in your way, Mr. Sampson. I know  you will admit, that a sinner condemned, cannot love Christ, well, you must also admit, that Christ has never  told any to obey his cornmandments, but those who lovo him. As baptism is one of his commandlments, what right have we to this sacrament, if we do not love Christ? If we love Christ, we are 'born from above,' consequent- ly our sins are pardoned without baptisn.." Mr. Sampson began to screw and twist about in his chair. At length he replied: -! "I admit the force of your argument, Mr. Weston, but you have not disposed of the passage. which I quoted as a proof-text. The Apostle said: 'Repent and be bap- tized every one of you, in the e af-Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.' Now, this is too plain to be mis- understood, and upon the strength of this, I assert that a man may repent, and believe, and yet his sins be unpar- doned, and be, till in a state of condemnation, until bap- 4tized." 'AiWhile, asserting that, yod forget that Jesus said: 6,1e that believeth on him is not condemned.' What a, flat contradiction of 'your theory! How do you harmionize such passages?" :  :;:Preacher -Sampson stroked his uncovered head again imperplexity. The assertion was too strong,- and the contradiction too flat to be covered over with sallies of false isms. .-Mr. Weston continued: '"Ifyou: still .assrt:.that the. believer is. condemned  afi U rt.      condemned.  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC8270-00000192"/> until baptized, I must bring up more contradiction to such a tleory. 'Ite that believeth on the Son hath ever- lasting life,' and still you would have him condemned!! 'I am the bread of life: he tlat cometh to me shall never thirst; and lhie that believeth on me shall never thirst.' 'And this is the will of Him that sent m-e, tlat every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life.' Yet you would have the penitent believer still in condemnation! As our Saviour has spoken otherwise, so will we, for you :cannot get the penitent believer into the water before his sins are pardoned, for, 'lie that believeth on Him is NOT CONDEMNED ' "Again: 'Verily, verily I say unto you, he that be- lieveth on me hath everlasting life'-is in actual posses- sion of it, and not at all incumbent on baptism. Paul, in discussing justification, explains this matter better than I can. He says: 'Therefore, by the deeds of the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness 6f God without the law, is manifested, being/ witnessed by the law and the prophets: even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God: being justified fireely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.' 'Thereforee e conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds ot the law.' But why need I multiply arguments here? It is enough for me to know that Christ has said, (if but once): 'lie that believeth on Hiim is not condemned.' You are welcome to your opinion, XMr. Sampson, but you cannot sustain it by this blessed volume, (holding the-Bible up,) unless you sadly pervert its teachings."  Mr. Sampson was worse discomfited than he wished to manifest, nor could he perceive of any place through which lhe might pass from the intricate trap which he had arranged himself, and in wlich he had been caught! Ie endllavored to establish his physical position, if not intellectual, by placing his feet with some emphasis on the 'rouind of a chair, which lost its balance by the un- ceremonious intrusion, and fell over, causing an interrup- tion of the painful 'ilence that was prevailing. Ia the confusion of the moment, Mr. Sampson summoned up courage, a4d made an answer like this: o,            "Your argument will do very well, Mr. Weston, but Peter tells us to be baptized for the remission of sins.  Let me read it again: 'Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remis- sion of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.' What language could be more conclusive of my lroposition? What could convey-the idea plainer, that  baptism is essential to salvation? Mark corroborates  this with very forcible argument, thus: 'He that believeth  and is baptized, shall be saved,'-along with faith and  the afljullct of faith, baptism saves the petitcent. Its  utility, who can estimate?! I will admit, Mr. Weston, tlhat y'or argument is very good, and would be conclu- n sive, were it not for the first text cited, strengthened by 4 the commission recorded by Mark. Peter knew whathe  was talking about, and the evangelist knew what he was recording, therefore the significance was not mystified by figurative, language as to ,be understood in so many Wtays."           -        - Mr. Sampson had gained the day indisputably! so  thought Dr. Boon, who had been a silent and attentive  listenler . "If Peter meant baptism for the remission of sins, as you construe it," interrupted Mr. Weston, "why did he j not make the sanm e assertion throughout lis preach- ings? If baptism is essential in one case, it is in another. If he aimed to teach it at one place, he would have taught it at others, where new congregations heard him. j For instance,- his preaching to the house of Cornelius. He declared: 'To him give all the prophets witness, that through His name whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins.' Mark it, he does not say, 'Whosoever is baptized shall receive remission,' but' 'whosoever beliereth shall receive remission. It strikes me very forcibly here, had baptism been essential, it wrould have been proclaimed in thundering tones, for Peter was addressing a new audience, and a new people- the Gentiles! How strange he did not utter all tht essen- tialities, when Cornelius signified that he was ready to hear wlhat he had to say. But no! he tells of our Sa- viour's death, burial and resurrection, and then says: '\Whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of k   &#xD;<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC8270-00000193"/> 88    ,    L A   IDV1t;1-iALL. sins.! 'which we firmly believe that Cornelius :did, for the Holy Ghost fell upon him and his household ; aj strange , incident to a man still in .condemnation!! i Afterwards, we are told that! water was commanded, but not until evidences wee given of their being received and adopted, by God, by the gift of the Holy Ghost! How strange baptism was not' recommended here for salvation, if it had been essential! ' Yet you cannot deny, Mr. Weston, but' that Peter tells us in the case referred to first, that baptism was es- sential," interrupted Dr. Boon.  , I deny that he meant such an interpretation. I don't believe that baptisms has any more to do with remission of sins, than the Lord's Supper, only as a sign." "That is a hazardous assertion, sir! You cannot prove it! for the Apostle said, in words ever to be remembered, 'Repent and be "baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for' the renission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.' How can such lan- guage be otherwise construed, than a literal interpreta- tion? You cannot dispose of that passage so easily, Mr. Weston! Thousands have tried to get it out of the way, but have failed:!", exclaimed Mr. Sampson. "Well, f -my argument fails, alow, me to give you a few inconsistencies of your doctrine, for your digestion. Tjet us examine Peter's language: ' Repent and be bap- tized, every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus, (is) for (or, as von understand it, in order that you may secure) the remission of sins.' Now let us compare this with Matt. iii: 11, the language of which, in the original, is precisely similar: ' I, indeed, baptize you 'with water (eis) unto repentance.' Will you maintain that John bap- tized- the Jews, in order that, they might repent-to cause them) to repent of theiif sins!! The preposition eis is em- ployed in both passages, precisely in the same manner! Peter said, ' Hepent,and be baptized (eis) forthe remission of sins; and John said:-' I indeed baptize you (eis)for or unto repentance.' ,If youmaintain that Peter baptized in order to the remission of sins, you must also maintain that John baptized the Jewms n order to repentance, for the mode of expression in bothsientences is the same.- The Jews came to John, confessing'their sins, and professing repentance; and into that profession John did baptize them. Hence,   T IJAE INV B wA u-ATl- XU4 .'   001  it was called the baptism of repentance, and is-equivalent * to baptism of remission, for pardon is always implied where confession is made in true earnestness. Then if 'He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life,' we ,-must conclude that those who believed on the day of Pentecost, were pardoned before baptized." "I will acknowledge that your argument is somewhat difficult to answer, and would suffer it to pass as incontro- vertible, but you have not disposed of that passage, Mr. Weston! It stands untouched." "And yet you acknowledge that my argument is good, and unanswerable." So I did(, and would passit as conclusive, were it not for that isolated assage." Which, if rightly considered, means no more baptism for remission of sins, than the Lord's Supper! I have proven, and that by your own consent, that it is impossi- ble for baptism to be for the remission of sins. Yet you hang on to that text as if your life depended on it. Well, your cause does at least, if your life does not. Now al- low me to give my honest opinion as to how that passage should be understood: 'Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, because of the remission of sins,' &amp;c. This is nothing more than a literal view. Nor have you any more right to place baptism for the remission of sins than repentance!--ftr both are commanded!-yet to find out which is essential' to salvation, we have t', make references to other porttions of the Bible. "For instance, baptisnl. Let us refer to it in all cases which can have any bearing on, this point. We will com- mence after the commissioi. since you do not esteem bap- tism administered previo(sly, as Christian. That is,-we will refer to it only in actual scenes where it was coin- manded by the Apostles. The first instance we find, is Philip and the Eunuch. In tlis, we find faith as a prere- quisite.- Philip said: 'If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest'-be baptized. -To this the Eunuch acquiesced, by saying: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God'! That was enough. 'He that believeth on him is not condemned!' Philip knew this, and bap- tized the pardoned penitent. ' The next we come to, is the case of- Saul of Tarsus. ' It. eems that he had faith, for he asks confidently, 'Lord, *   ?          .    .          .7  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC8270-00000194"/>  ;382- *  7LEANDER   IALL S what wilt thou have me to do?' He was commanded to go to Damascus, and it would be told him there what he wns to do. What did Ananias tell him to do? 'The( God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldst know his will, and see that just ONE, and shouldst hear the voice of his mouth. For thot -shalt be his woiness unto all, of what thou hast seen and heard'-that lie should preach the Gospel to the Gentiles. That was what the Lord told Ananias to communicate to Paul. Not to be baptized for the remission of sins, for we are told Paul believed, inso- much that he exclaimed, ' Lord, what wilt thou have nle to do?' Now after he had received his sight, and the gift of the Ioly Ghost, (which we cannot think was giv- en to any condemned and unpardoned man!) then Anla- nias tells him to arise and be baptized, and zwash away his sins, calling on the name of the Lord." "Tle Very tling, Mr. Weston, that. we arc aiming for!" exclaimed Mr. Sampson. "If that is not baptism for thle re nission of sins, I would like for you to tell me what it is! 'And now why tarriest thou? Arise, and be bap- tized. and wash away thy sins,' &amp;c. It is the clearest. proof-text in the Scripture! Who can deny it?"And in the exuberance of his delight, he stamped: his foot, and rubbed his forehead, running his fingers through lis hair rapidly. ' You are too fast, Mr. Sampson. If you take that lit- erally it must mean that water literally washes away our sins! Now Alexander Campbell himself never claimed as much. Since our sins ar9 immaterial, they cannot be wash- ed away literally by water. This you will admit. Now the immaterial cannot be operated on by dead material sub. stance; therefore baptism, literally; cannot wash away sins, which are immaterial. This accords w\it:itrue phi- losophy and logic. It cannot he denied. If the literal sense cannot be taken, then the figurative must, for it certainly hasa meaning. Now hearthe latter. Through- out the Jewish dispensation, water was always regardedl as aiII emblem of purification, for the thing signified. Now we know that literally; it would be impossible to cleanse the heart by water, but as a figure it could be ,used. Hence in this instance, it meant nothing but an emblem as to the manner it is spoken of. Paul had been pardon- od, adopted, aud accepted by Christ, or God would not e       d would not .    have called him a 'chosen vessel.' The gift of the IIoly  Ghost had also been added, yet there Iws a command that he had not obeyed, the en'iblenm of his purification, and the representation of our Saviour's death, burial and resurrection. This was baptism, the first sign ever giveu of spiritual blessings. Like Abraham, who received cir- cumcision after faith, so received Paul a seal of the right- eousncss of the faith which he had, yet bcing 'unbaptized. But why need we dwell on this, since we kuow that it is impossible for the dead material to operate on the uncon- nected immaterial, as to works of dead nlatter? Can the application of water reach the soul literally? Verily not. Therefore, baptisri for the remission of sin, in the sense in which you take it, is impossible." "We do not claim that water iwashes away sins liter- ally, but it is the obedience which obtains pardon," con- tended Mr. Sampson. "Then if it is the obedience, why not take. the inten- tion as well as the act? What is there more that is vir-  tuous in the act of being immersed, than 'there is in the resolution? What is in the act, to remit sins, more than in the resolve?" "But you know--"' "I know when a man joins your Church, he "las re- solved to be baptized. Now that resolution is equivalent in virtue, to the act. I vould ask you what more is there in the simple form of going down into the water, to for- give one's sins, than there is in the resolution of doing so? As far as he is concerned, he hlas promised to obey. A surrender to God is virtually m ade now. What more can the form accomplish." "You are very unjust, Mr. Weston, in-" "I ask your pardon, sir. The purpose of this discus- sidn, if I am correct, was to remove all stumbling stones out of the way of Truth. I must remove every block, or the path will be obstructed." "Oh well, then, you are welcome to all you lave gain- ed. Let us proceed," said the preacher, in a mollitying tone, who sought to smooth over the roughness of his path, by nonchalance. "We were endeavoring to find out the design of bap- tism, by reverting to adtual scenes of its enactment, in the Bible. Next comes Cornelius, which we have already  &#xD;<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC8270-00000195"/> noticed, and who we found received the Holf'Ghost be. fore being baptized. So this ordinance was not adminis tered for remission in 'this case. So we will just pass tha on, if yousay sa o. Mr. Sampson was very willing. "The next reference, is of Lydia and her household You will admit that they all had faith, as they wer grown people?" Oh, certainly. I do not believe that any one through out the whole Scriptures, was baptized without avowe faith." "Very  well, nw, when we remember, 'He tha believeth on Him, is not condemned,' we are constrained to think that baptism was not administered there, anu no where else, for the remission of sins! Therefore, le us cease to multiply arguments unnecessarily. If: ' B grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of your selves;'.then our salvation is: 'Not of works, lest anl man should boast.' If our salvation Was dependent oi works, or an act of ours, then we are saved by works But we are,saved by grace, and not of works, hence bap tism is not essential to our salvation. Make man's re demption dependent on his own works, and wher would he be? Where would be the beauty of the plat of salvation? Such would rob Christ of his merit." "You forget, Mr. Weston, that one of the Apostle tellsus that faith is dead without works,-'But wilt thoi know, O vain man, that faith without works is deadl  You certainly have foigotten that passage." "Not at all,. sir. We only differ as to its reference. contend, that when God tries and condemns the sinner and Christ justifies him, or justifies God in forgiving th, :sinner, then he is saved by grace. His: sins are all impu ted to Christ and his trial is over. ,Now many profess t, have experienced that trial, but have been mistaker whose faith is like Simon the sorcerer, who was yet'- i1 the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquityJ Which fact was made maiiifest, by his, lack of prope works. Consequently, as James says:-'Even so, faiti if it hath not works, is dead, being alone"!' IPeter speak of such characters- thus :-' These atare iwells . withou water, clouds that are carried: with atempest .to- wIor the mist of darkness is reserved forever.' Johrialso says   IW IL J         S CJ  L 9 T J L k lA *JkX A A. A , uW.  'They went out from us, but they were not-of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with' us: but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.' There certainly is such a character of believers; but a christian, a true believer, t    will have works; and James meant f6r the Church to try their faith by their works, in order to see whether they possessed the proper spirit or not. If they said that they had faith, and not works, then they were not sub- jects of divine grace, therefore they had no right in the (Church of Christ. He went on tdk show how works ac- companied faith, so as to give the Church an. idea how to try an individual on that score. He was not addressing God, and telling him how to try believers; but he was giving the Church a specimen of true faith, which is al- wavs accompanied by works. Remember, will you, that the sinner is already saved, when his sins are pardoned; therefore, to agree with Paul, his salvation is by grace through faith. When an individual is born from above, he is-saved by grace, free grace of God, and his works will justify that grace, hence you have the rule by which to try spirits to see if they are of God. If they are of God they will do God's will, but if not, the devil's will." It was all against Mr. Sampson! He saw it, and felt i    it, together with others present. Prudence dictated si- lence. He was not as well posted as he thought, and he inwardly resolved to give the matter a loser cxamina- tion, when alone. Dr. Boon saw the unpleasant situation which his friend was in, and proposed an adjournment, which we know, is always in order. The company broke up. Dr. Boon and Mr. Sampson left together, but not a word was spoken in reference to the subject just discussed, for Dr. Boon felt the force of the argument, and Mr. Sampson was laboring under disappointment. When on his way' to Mr. Weston's house, his soul was enwrapped in pleasant dreams of tri- umph, but now a melancholy cast had succeeded, and a reality of unlooked-for defeat was being tealized. 88   .

HE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, IN WHCH IT IS PROVEN THAT BAPTISM CANNOT BE PROCURATIVE OF THEREMSSION OF SINS, FOQR,    -          ^ "He that believeth on Him is NOT CONDEMNED!"--John "i. 8. Day after day, Annie Bacon performed her laborious task, to the entire satisfaction of Madame Morris, and her patrons. But the sedentary life, together witl the toil and cares encumbent thereon, preypd perceptibly on her health. Summer had gone, and autumn, with her rich ioliage of gorgeous hues, began to dawn. Annie had never heard a word from home. She had written to Mollie Weston, but the letter, by some accident, had failed to reach its place of destination, so no reply was receivecd Many, many days did she watch the post-office, in breathless anxiety, but to no purpose. One evening as she sat under the ill-protecting accom- modation of one of tie elms in the yard of Milton Col- lege, her thoughts began to steal back to the happy days spelnt at home, surrounded by such endearing associa- tions! A deep crowd of emotions swelled her heaving bosom as by-gone scenes, passed in a train across her mental vision. A happy home, a doating' parent, and a fond lover, showering his jewels of affections, at her feet, almost akin to adoration; and then, on all sides, srliles of welcome, and approval greeted her. The chilly au-'  tumnal winds passed unnoticed, and the dismal creaking of the giant oak, as it sent its thrill of cringing sensation through the frame, but played its gloomy part, unob- served. Annie Bacon was reveling in the past'! Yes, a bright past was hers, if the future did' look (ark. Aiso the days of girlhood, spent descending the unruffled stream of time, lent a glow of happiness to the pleasing picture. And then, the period when school books were r )   THE INVESTIGATION.        887 put aside, at the beginning of a new era in life, the hour when the lover first whispered his heart's deep dreams, and hopes, all aided in producing a blissful mood, co-ef- ficient with torpor and insensibility! But her thoughts took a change. The shadows of the present began to creep like some ill-omen, intobher memory. One by one, b her troubles stole before her view. And now she was dwelling in reality! A rapid survey of her forlorn con- dition, caused a shudder deep and trying to envelop her frame. Banished from her parental roof, thrown upon the cold charities of the world, unprotected, uncared for, and neglected, were the heart-rending features of her fate! jt2  mWhile in this mood of painful thought, her heart was touched to tears. The deep fountain which had been concealed under external duties, was now troubled to surging billows when the covering was removed. Hot burning tears chased each other down her cheeks, until her face was wet with the bright dew distilled from a sea of pain, by the soul's great grief. How long she remained there, she knew not, but the half genial rays of the sun, stealing through cold beds of Wintery ether, were ominously struggling for attachment, to some earthly object, while their master source was near out of sight, ere she was aroused from her painful revery. Madame Morris was the instrument of this affection. She had missed Annie from the house, and instinctively sought her in that melancholy spot, having observed in her manner a gloomy and reserved disposition, which would induce-her to resort hither. "Miss Bacon, it is too cold for you to remain here in this searching wind; come go to the house. I have some- thing for you. Come on," said the Madame, laying her hand on her head, and pointing to-the College. "1No; excuse me. What have you for me? I was tired of the bustle and confusion that prevailed yonder, (pointing to the house,) and sought the quietude of this spot. I am not cold, so please deliver me what you have in your possession, right here;"' pleaded the anxious girl, rising to her feet.  "Not until you promise to return immediately after its perusal."  - i-Then it is, . letter!" she exclaimed with joy and anxiety. "Yes, from ypur home." r 1nxietYV  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC8270-00000197"/> Sj888      LEAN D R fALL . HOME home! What stirring intonations ever accotd i- panies the pronunciation of that word! Tears again caused Annie's eyes to swim, like orbs of melancholy light,'in diamond pools, gushing from the emotions of her troubled heart. J "Madame Morris," said she, with "touching pathos, "I beg you to tantalize me no longer! Were you ever 'far away from home, and shut out from all tidings from that much loved spot? Remember that event, and have compassion on me. Believe me, I have not been accus- tomed to such a life as this. Please let me have the let- ter here, for were I to return to the house, to read it, the confusion of the academy, together with the painful remi- niscences consequent on the epistle, would distract me. If there is sad intelligence in it, let me hear it here, in the solemn company of Nature's inanimate world, and where there is none to record my grief, only as it marks its foot prints on the lineament of my person. Oh please, Madame Morris, favor me this one time, and I promise to seek my room as soon as I am through reading the letter."  There was something melting in her tones, which caused the Madame to give up the missive without ano- ther word, and turn and leave the pleader alone. Annie tore the envelope with trembling fingers; and the beating heart fluttering like a wounded dove, told plainly of her-agitation. It was from Mollie Weston, who had waited a long time for a notice of Annie's post-office, but in vain, and had ventured to address her at the place recommended. In this she was lucky. If it is not considered too much of a puerile action, we will give a brief account of its contents, which ran thus: "Dear Annie:-                 e "Long have I waited a fulfillment of your promise, but to no effect, and IPnow have to venture On uncertainties in order to hear from you. I cannot attribute this to neglect on your part, for I believe you have been faith- ful, but some derangement in the mails has, as I hope, been the cause of my futile watching. You remember  when you, left, it was uncertain about your permanent stay in B--, therefore, the stipulations made, were, that you keep me posted of your whereabouts. To this I have eubscribed patiently as possible, until now.    THE INVESTIGATIOAN.        Y "I know you are anxious to hear of everthing that-has happened since you left M---, but you must excuse me from going into minute details, and 'suffer' me to relate the most important transactions, which need no supplemental accompaniments, to interest one. Time j since ybu left has been fructiferous of changes, and start- ling events, some of which I will give you. "Immediately after your departure, Mr. Sumner called to make inquiries of your whereabouts. Oh! Annie I felt so Sorry for him, when he told me farewell, with such a look lof hopelessfiess-and despair, as I never wish to see again. Then came off the protracted meeting, of which I will say nothing, as it cannot be of much con- cern to you. In the meantime Mr. Sampson returned, and he is now assisting in the prosecttion of the same old discussion which has by age, grown none the less in- teresting. Your father, Annie, (of whom I feel loth to speak,) has secluded himself'entirely from society. Leander Hall, once the resort of the gay, is now a deserted castle, I   looking ten times graver than one could ever imagine it to appear. There is such a soberness, aided by the gloomy air of fall, enshrouding the once gay looking scenes, that I seldom look thitherward, but a solemn at- mosphere of indescribable mixture seems to creep over my soul, and I, even I, who have enjoyed its welcoming smiles but a little while, sigh for those days which can n    'ver come back! The bright frontispiece, Annie, seems to have relapsed into dark shades, and the rose and the myrtle have ceased to bloom. The Lombardy poplars are almost robbed of their silvery dressing, and the once greensward, of-velvetry carpeting, has changed its color to a dusty yellow hue. And even a change has  apparently come over the servants. We seldom see any out, and when we do, there is a peculiar air that charac- terizes them-something of fear and extreme caution, together with a subdued expressio. But I will cease to remind you of such painful associations, and hasten to close this letter, for twilight is gathering rapidly, and the lines which I am trying to trace, are fast becoming dim. "I would not pain you dear Annie unnecessarily, but Madame Rumor is rife with the report that Mr. Sumner is visiting Miss TLankinston with serious intentions!"  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC8270-00000198"/> 390       LEANDER HALL. Poor Annie! She was not prepared for this. She had schooled herself to live separated from him, but not to see another take the place sheonce claimed! 'Ah! who can describe the acute suffering of such a pain? She was almost paralized by the shock of the above in- telligence; so much so that her face assumed a death- like hue, and her strength failed her. She laid the fatal document down, and tried to weep, but oh! her feelings were too deep for tears! A long time she sat, essaying to bring her thoughts on some point, but her efforts were of no avail. A calmness was at last effectually courted, so she re- sumed the reading of the letter, with indifference, for what other blow, could there be hurled, to reach her now? "Though I cannot say that I credit this report, for I believe the intention is all on her part, because I feel that shelis a designing woman of many culpabilities, con- cealed by ingenulity.

If this ever reaches you, answer without delay, and I will  be prompt in replying. Till then," "'Your true friend;   MOTITE." "And this is my fate!" said Annie calmly, as she re-  folded the letter. "I had not anticipated anything so bad, but O Lord, thy will be done! It is for thee, dear Jesus, that I have made this sacrifice, and nothing half commensurate with the sacrifice thou didst make for me! Oh! what sacrifice is there too great to be made for thy cause? Teach me thy will to know, and give me grace to walk in thy commandments which are perfect! 4In thee, O Lord, do Iput my trust: let me never be put to confusion. Forsake me not, but hold me up for   TIIE INVESTIGATION.        891 'I am come into deep waters,' and thy hand can only sus tain me." And thus the stricken girl prayed until twir light had deepened into night, by which she was reminded of her promise to Madame Morris, so she gathered up the light shawl which had fallen from her shoulders, and repaired to the house, Four weeks elapsed at M---, before preacher Samp- son could spare time to take a part in the discussion, which had been suspended on that account. Whether it was his design to allow the force of his antagonist's argument to be forgotten, or whether it was from the press of business we cannot say. Dr. Boon went to see him and urged the necessity of inimmediate prosecution, until he became tired of the j   every day's task, so he abandoned him, and was going to offer himself as a substitute, just as the veritable preacher announced himself ready to assist. The coterie met again, at Mr. Weston's house, but this tifme it was night, as they had become lengthened, and Dr. Boon could find no surplus time in the day, his calls beinl so numerous.  Peacher Sampson had addicted himself sedulously to the study of the subject, so we may expect to heara per- feet exposition of all error. He had grown quite conceited and brave, from read- ing one side of the question which of course was in his favor. Alexander Campeil's writings were read and re- read until Mr. Sampson was as familiar with his doctrine, as lhe was with the members of his Church. The fact was, the thing (baptism for the remission of sins,) had been told so often, and asserted in the face of contrary evidence, that he was obliged to believe it. Such is often the case., "Itmust be borne in mind, where we left off," re- marked Mr. Weston, by way of introducing thl subject after the company had assembled. The reminiscence was not of the most pleasant kind to Mr. Sampson. He intimated as much by a restless turn he gave in his chair, to cover his embarrassment. "I thillk if I remember aright, that we were about through With the proof-text which I introduced in our last j discussion," began Mr. Sampson, making a slight movq towards the table on which was the Bible.  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC8270-00000199"/> 892       LE AND R HALL. "I'm quite willing to let the proposition pass, as it was disposed of on the other occasion," replied Mr. Weston. "Then wewill go on to the next, which is derived from the fact, that the baptism of John was connected with the remission of sins. So reads the divine testimony-' In those days came John the Baptist-preaching the bap- tism of repentance for the remission of sins.' Nor is this a peculiar style of any one of the Evangelists. Luke also; speaks of the design of John's baptism, in almost. identical words. He says: 'And he came into the country bordering on the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.' (iii: 3.) All four of the Evangelists agree in this fact, that baptism should be connected with the remission of sins. Matthew says: 'Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.' Mark reads thus ' John did baptize in the wilderness,  and preached baptism of repentance for the remission'of sins. Here is the concurrence of three Evangelists, is this not enougih-to establish the) point? One passage of scripture is considered as a proof-text, much more should three. In fact, Zachariah, that extraordinary minister, and father of the forerunner of Christ, uttered a predic- tion concerning his son's new mission, which corroborates this view. He spoke the following words: 'And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest :-to give knowledge of salvation unto his' people b-y the re- mission of their sins.' This was a new doctrine, and evidently meant baptism for the remission of sins." Dr. Boon's hopes were somewhat revived when the preacher concluded so triumphantly! : Mr. Sampson felt highly exalted, himself. Nor did he imaginle of any way to dispose of the incontrovertible argument, which he adduced. In the delight of this delusion he poised his left foot on a stool with an air of non- chalence, that unfortunately made the ottoman lose its equilibrium, and turn a somersault on the floor, makilg a slight break on the imperturbable air in which he was so happily reveling.  "You must make a direct answer to the' summed up evidence Mr. Weston, orthe thing is gone from you for- ever. Indeed, I cannot see how (even if you reply) such ,-    TLTlHE       INVESTIGATIpON.       93 language can be rebutted, it is so clear and explicit," said Dr. Boon, highly pleased with his pastor's defense. "I will notice the gentleman immediately," replied Mr. Weston, taking a book and looking over its pages. There was a silence of a few. nioments. Mr. Weston at length began: j  "You have endeavored to prove sir, that baptism is for the remission of sins. When we disputed on this subject before, I think I proved satisfactorily, (I have heard no complaint if I did not,) that salvation was of free grace, through faith in Christ. That from the mo- ment of the promise of the Messiah, all who lhave been saved, were saved by his merit. This you admitted; then. how can you now make our salvation dependent on works, and those too, which are to be performed by the will of another? God never intended a man's salvation to rest on the performance of another, as baptism is. For instance, were I to believe to-day, but could not be baptized under a month hence, as I could find no one to administer that ordinance, would not (if baptism is for the remission of sins,) my salvation be -dependent on another's performance? and my security jeopardized by i'  the will of another? Such redemption God never in- tended for man." "I know all that argument is very good, Mr. Weston, nevertheless John preached the doctrine of baptism for the remission of sins, as, I have proven." "I protest against such a doctrine sir. You are incor- rect. John did not preach the doctrine of baptism for the remission of sins, but he preached 'the baptism of re- pentance for the remission of sins.' This is the mistake into which you have fallen. Repentance secured the -remission of sins; and on profession of repentance, the Jews were baptized, afid into the faith of His (Christ's,) coming. Butif we were to admit your construction on the various passages which you have quoted, how are we to know whether baptism or repentance secured the remis- sion? or whether they were of equal import or not? We know it was the fiequent custom of inspired writers to connect the exteraal ordinances with the inward grace, or with the blessings of which they were signs or pledges, as in Ezekiel: 'Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean; from all your filthiness, and from  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC8270-00000200"/> bU4     . LEANDER HALL. all you idols will I cleanse you.' Now by taking this passage out of its connection, I can prove that the sprinkling of clean water upon persons, will purify them from idolatry and sin; a doctrine which none of us be- lieve. Just so, is the water alluded to in the cases brought up. The water was an external sign, or pledge of deliv- erance from sin!" "Your observations, Mr. Weston, are two broad-cast. You have not confined -yourself to the last passages quoted at all," protested preacher Sampson, uneasily. "If I am not mistaken, I made special reference to them the first thing I did. But if such don't please you, we will attend more directly to the points. Now, you assert that Christian baptism was not instituted until on the day of Pentecost. Under such considerations why. can you go back to John's baptism, to prove that baptism is for the remission of sins?!! If sins were remitted through John's baptism thenl, it must have been Christianl baptism, the same as on the day of Pentecost. 'But thatf does not concern us now. I say, sir, you have no right 'to go back to John's baptism to prove anything, for you repudiate it as being Christian baptism!" The cunning Mr. Sampson was caught! He saw it, and cringed under the blow. It is a wonder that Mr. Campbell never saw the inconsistency, but as his theory is so full of incompatible doctrines, he may be excused for this one. "Yet," continued Mr. Weston, "I will not pass your proof-text by, unnoticed. The baptism of John was called the-baptism of repentance; this you will not deny. 'Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is botrn of God.' Now confession, and repentance are apposite terms, or, are of the same significance. So John bap- tized penitent believers into the faith of Christ coming, so says the Apostle Paul:-' John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, tlat is, on Christ Jesus.' Then his baptism was no more flo the remission of sins, than Paul's, or Cornlelius' who iwe are told received the gift of the Ioly Ghost, previously!" Mr. Samipson began to think that Mr. Weston wal; right, but he was not allowed to think so, audibly. "But that you may be better satisfied, Mr. Sampson, ' : "^'. . .* *' -     .A   THliJ 1 NV a --uaLv- A- t would ask you a question, here. If John baptized for the remission of sins, what was Christ baptized for?-he was baptized by John, and his baptism certainly had the same object in view, as others who were baptized. Will you say that He was baptized for the remission of sins? "We cannot think, Mr. Weston, that Christ's baptism had th3 same import, as that administered to others.'- "I contend that Christ submitted to thht ordinance ftr the same reason that others should, viz: ' lf fu fil. a riqhteousness.' He knew also, the death that he was goiln to die, and that it was but right that his death and burial should be prefigured by himself, and others who should believe on him, for it was his death, which secured sal- vation. The design of that baptism, as far as he was (  -concerned, was a fiure of his death, burial and resurrec- tian, and to the sinner, a sign 'of his death to sin, and an emblem of Christ's death, burial alid resurrection. Our Saviour was baptized to represent this, and he command- ed the sinner to be baptized to represent the sanme with the additional of hi (the sinner's) death to sin, and a nerw- ness of life, as purchased by the Saviour. 'Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism, into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk il newness of life.' Remember, it does not say that baptism a ;complishes this newness of life, but our being raised up 'rom the watery grave, is like-a representation of Christ s resurrection. it may be regarded here as being also an emblem of pu- 'rification, not the thing itself, but the emDlem. Such I think is a brief synopsis of the design of John's baptism, to which Christ submitted; and such also-was the design of Peter's baptism. The penitent believer in Christ, al- ready pardoned, is baptized in obedience to a command, into the representation of Christ's death, burial and res- urrection, declaring his own death to sin thereby; and into one body,' which is Christ's Church, visible. Make it otherwise and you must tear out from the Bible: ' He that believeth on him is not condemnned.' And ' -e that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life.' And ' VlWho- soever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born -of God.' If born of God, we are heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, and yet, you will have us condemned unltil we ,. - are baptized! I leave that for you to arrange"  6w   &#xD;<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC8270-00000201"/> 896       LEANDER   HALL. Certainly, Mr.. Sampson had taken. a very hard chair, for it did not seem at all comfortable. An effort must be made to redeem the almost expired cause, so thought the hero of Campbellism, and accord- ingly he fell on the first assistance he could call to mind. "If you will not let that pass as argument, (he knew a he had no right to it, since he repudiated John's baptism,) I think I can find something in the commission, that will, wihich is: 'Baptizing them into the nam o the 'Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.' No language could -be more explicit of a change, than the phrase just quoted. The preposition 'into' is of new translation, I admit,'but we find many distinguished Baptists agreeing with us as to its correctness." "There can be no doubt of its correctness, Mr. Samp- son, so proceed, making itof as much advantage as you can," said Mr. Weston, seeing that his opponent hesitated. Mr. Sampson obeyed. "The word into expresses a very different sense from in, the former. denotes union and relation, and the latter merely intimates authority. For instance: 'In the name of the commonwealth,' is very different from, 'into the name  of the commonwuealth.' Into always denotes change of po- sition; a transition from one state to another. A person enters into, not in matrimony. This solemn and'siguifi- cant moral change, or transition out of the world into Christ is consummated in the following manner:-The Gospel is proclaimed to them without the kingdom. Men hear and believe it,. become penitent, and are baptized into the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. They then puton Christ, are baptized into himn and are new creatures." "I know," replied Mr. Weston, "that the word ' 'nto,' expresses new relation, but the nature of that relation is the matter of dispute betwen us. Yoh colitend that bap- tizing into Christ is a radical change of the heart-a change from the sinner, to the Christian, if that be the ease, the baptizing of the Israelites unto. Moses, must have denoted a change from the Hebrew, to Mosesites!! If the former be correct, so must the latter, as the unto, expresses as much new-relation as 'into'! The He- brew Children 'were all baptized unto Moses, in the cloud, and in the sea,' which, to carry out your theory, would   I\ .        PTHE INVESTtGATIoN.        897 have changed them all to Mosesites, instead of Israelites! But this is not the construction for which I zealously con- tend. The baptising of the believing penitent into Christ, does not effect a change on the immaterial ;  such as remission of sins, but it is an introduction into the visible body of Christ, which is a material relation, and is therefore comprehensive of material effect. The body of Christ, (his Church,) is no longer mystical. Sincl John the Baptist, first baptised, and prepared a visible body for the Saviour, and then pointed to the Light, the. body of Christ has been a visible organization, therefore, material, and capable only of effecting a relation, con- cerning its visibility." Mr. Sampson made an attempt at demurring, but it was not worth a record. - Mr. Weston continued: "To say that baptism effects the remission of sins, is a flat contradiction of our Saviour's own words, which I will remind you of,' again. 'He that believeth on him, is not condemned!' And: 'He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life,'-is already in possession of it. - You say yourself, that you would not baptize any one unless he believes on the Son." "Yes, sir; we baptize only believers," was the gruff reply, to the look of inquiry given by Mr. Weston, when he hesitated at this point. . "Then, according to your own admission, you baptize only those who ' hatl everlasting life,' and yet you would have the believing penitent condemned! his sins unpar- doned!! and in possession of everlasting life (!!!). Can language portray the gross inconsistency? You may re- eoncile'your sayings wi-th the Bible, but I cannot!" The excitement increased, to double force, while the urgency of the case marshalled the now defendant into action. Mr. Sampson must arouse! for furtive glances, and significant sighs, plainly spoke the necessity of this. Dr. Boon drew his chair closer, and preacher Sampson seized the New Testament, and turned over its leaves in great haste. "Here it is," he muttered half to himself, and half aloud, as he came to the third chapter of John. A ray. of hope lit up his countenance, and a slight smile, compounded of chuckling, played around his thin and elastic lips. He resumed his posture of ease and read:  &#xD;<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC8270-00000202"/> 898       LEANDER HALL. "' There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicode. mus a ruler of the Jews: The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto hiri, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these mir- acles that thou dost, except God be with him. Jesus an- swered, and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be torn when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Veli- ly, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of WA- TElR, and of the SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.' What language could be more explicit? Born of WATER, and of the SPIRIT! Will this admit of any other interpretation?' Could language be more unam-, bignous? Christ has said it, and so do I 'Except a man be born of WATER, and of the SPIRIT, he cannot enter into kingdom of God'!! You will not presume, sir, to try to rebut this argumenut," concluded the enthusiast.. "No sir," responded Mr. Weston, "I would not rob any of the sacred Scriptures of its beauty; a thing which I would do, were I to try to rebut that passage. It incul- cates the very idea, for which I have been contending." "Wha V t! you?" exclaimed the astonished man; his eyes distending in astonishment. 'Yes, me. Perhaps yop do not comprehend me. If you will suffer me to explain, I think I can make the matter clear." "Certainly, Mr. Weston, give as extensive explana- tion as you wish," conceded Mr. Sampson. " ell, allow me first, to ask you a few questions. Do you consider that the sinner is saved by grace, through faith, or'by works?"' "By Qrace through faith, of course." " Thenr you will admit that many have entered the kingdon of heaven, or rather what is denominated God's  universal kIingdom, without baptisnm?" "Oh yes, for thousands 11ave lived and died before bap- tism was administered, who were saved by faith, as for il- stance, Abraham." "Then if that be the case,baptism cannot be account- ed as essetitialto salvation, for what is necessary in man's salvation in one instance, must be also in others; as all                    .   THE INVESTIGATION.        899 are depraved alike, and all need alike the regenerating - 'influence of God, to change that depifaity. If some have gone to heaven without baptism, all can go there without it." "Why, Mr. Weston! you represent Christ as making a false assertion!" exclaimed Mr. Sampson, in astonish-  ment. J   "Not at all my dear sir. I was only trying to prove that Christ, by the term 'kingdom of God,' did not mean the universal kingdom, which embraces the reign of God,. in the celestial as well as terestrial regions, for many have entered into it, without baptism, as you will readily admit,  "j Certainly; but what do you think he meant by the term ' kingdom of God'?" "He must have meant something limited. Inspeak- ig of the kingdom of God, he did not mean heaven or paradise restored, as I have proven, but he had reference to things which transpire in earth, or to use his language: 'If I lhave told you of earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?' That is, he had becn speaking of things connected with eartli, land Nicodemus believed him not, how would it be possible for- him to believe him if he were to tell of the miracles of heaven? Now he had been telling him what was necessary for a man to enter the kingdom of God; then of course, that kingdom must have been of a pre- scribed nature, and confined to this earth! Do you repu- diate this view, Mr. Sampson, or do you accept it?" I  "I accept it, of course, for Christ certainly had refer- once to things that had transpired, or were to transpi re in the earth. At least he signified as much in the 12th verse. "Ve'ry good. Now what do you suppose he meant by the term 'kingdom of God'?"  "If he alluded to something -confined to the earth, it imnst have been the visible Church of God, which is often "alled the kingdom of God, and sometimes the Kingdom of heaven, by the insplired writers. It must have been that i',gdom of heaven, which John the Baptist proclaimed, ap being at hand, and which he termed thus, because it wag different in nature from the kingdoms of the earth." "To my notion, your answer is very correct, Mr. Sampr  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC8270-00000203"/> 400       LEANDER- HALL. soni and I am happy to state that we agree so far. Now I have contended, and ever will contend, that no one ban enter the visible Church of Christ, legitimately, without being born of WATER! that is, without being baptized! Bt remember that one must be born of the Spirit, or rather born from above, (as it is in the original,) previously to this water birth! Do not understand me to say that Church membership is essential to salvation. Persons can be born from above without being born of water, but cannot enter into that visible kingdom, without both births! Baptism, by all denominations, has ever been considered as a Church separating ordinance, from the world, and where there is no baptism, no Church is recognized. Then to enter the kingdom of God, or the kingdom of heaven, (as the Church is often termed by the Evangel- ists,) we must be born of the SPIRIT and WATER. Yet, ' He that believeth on him, is not condemned,' whether he belongs to the invisible body of Christ, or the visible." Mr. Sampson looked somewhat dolorous, when he first perceived the trap he had set, and in which he had un- consciously entered. Dr. Boon seemed so vexed and per- plexed, that he hardly knew what to think, or to do. Things to him were assuming very serious appearances. Mr. Weston continued. "As corroborative of this view, Christ, after describing the spiritual birth, goes on to reprove Nicodemus' igno- rance about such an important matter; something like this: 'What! have you been a teacher in Israel all this while, and know not of the spiritual birth?-the regen- eration of grace, to which' the patriarchs and prophets were subjected?' It musst be remembered that the Pharisee did not marvel-at the water birth, for doubtless he had seen numbers baptized, and understood its import as well as any other Pharisee could, who rejected the counsel of Gbd. But this being born from above, was an idea at which he marveled, inasmuch as he was not a subject of this divine grace, and could not perceive, or comprehend its spirituality. 'There are three births alluded to in this chapter: the fleshy birth, the water, and the spiritual birth. When Christ first told Nicodemus (in verse 8d) that he must be born again, his "allusion was to but one birth, the spiritual, which would enable him to 'see' the kingdom of God, not   I '    t.   1TsE INVE6TI GATION-.      401 'enter' it. By this birth he would comprehend that the kingdom then preached, was of a spiritual nature, instead -}  of a national character, as the Jews then thought. But to 'enter' it'visibly, he must be born of WATER also. The words 'see' and' enter' have their distinct signification. "That Christ often meait his visible Church by the  term 'kingdom of God,' it is universally admitted, and that he did .o ii this case, it cannot be denied. If any doubt should be felt, we have but to read the connection,  and the proof is incontestible. Then by this, we assert that baptism is a birth!-a representative birth, the spirit being the efficient cause of the change; or water birth (  the outward sign, or the emblem, and the spirit birth the thing signified. To prove this theory, I will quote Ro- mans vi: 4: 'Therefore we are buried with him by bap- tism into death, that like as Christ was raised up by the glory of the Father'-into a -newness of life-'even we also'--who are raised up from the I  atery grave--' should walk in newness of life,' represented thereby. To be plainer, our burial in the water represents Christ's burial 'in the earth, and our being raised up, is like his resurrec- tion, which was a newness of ife. So water baptisn, is not the quickening birth, but is a representative birth, that is, it is an outward birth which denotes the inward regeneration, and separates the Christian from the world, by a visible nark." Preacher Sampson saw at once that he had been caught, by his own admissions; so he forebore any remarks for a while, but at length he spoke, feeling it incumbent on himself to break'the silence.  "Wo have no assurance, sir, that any one was ever saved who did not enter the kingdom of God visibly. Then how can you say that baptism is not essential?" "Perhaps, Mr. Sampson, you have not, but I have. The kingdom of heaven was preached before the thief on the cross, was promised that he should be with Christ in'paradise, and we know he had never been born of water, or entered into the visible Church! But, sir, I would ask you one question: What right have you to go after passages to prove that baptism is for the remission of sins, which were given, as you say, before Christian baptism was instituted? Now I do wish you to bear this point in memory, and remember that I am under no ob- ligations whatever to answer any saich argument." 84  &#xD;<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC8270-00000204"/> 402       LEANDER- HALL. Mr. Sampson saw his error, but it was too late. He had been called to order on that point before. "Bring up something, Bro. Sampson, which he cannot refute," suggested one of the brother Campbellites pres- ent, who was becoming tired of such fruitless efforts of defence. Dr. Boon handed him the New Testimen, to jog is memory. He took the hint and began to look over Papl's witings. The passage sought wa soon found. A gleam of satisfaction shot across his countenance, and poising both feet again on the same ottoman, he began:  "If I have brought up no a1rg'urment yet that will pass, I will bring up some now. Listen! h' rist loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he may sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.' That the 'oashing of water here spoken of; has reference to bap- tism, is almost universally admitted. All commentators of any note, concur with me. The Westminster divines gave this significalice, also!" "And yet you have admitted, Mir' Sampson, that you do not think that wadter literally washes awxay sins." "I kuow Ibhave, but that does not afibet this text."  "say it does. If water does not literally wash away sins, then youLcannot- take that passage literally; there- fore, if the Water wa usied as a figure, it is just the thing for which I amni contending. In Eze. xxxvi, 25, we have the idea, that sprinkling of clean water will cleanse from idols and all filthiness. Nvow, no one believes that water sprinkled on a person polluted with idols and filthiness will literally cleanse him, neither canll baptism. The Apos- tle connects together the emblem, and the thing signified, or else how can you reconcile the saying of our Saviour, that I'le that believeth on him is not condemned'? Yor can any one think that. the materiality can influence quickened immateriality. I wisli this to be held in memory.  Our sins are immaterial, while water is mate. rial, an'd also of the inanimate creation." eut sir, we do not contend that the -water washes aay the sins literally, but it is the act of obedience." "How so? When one joins your Church  'has he not obeyed, as far as the will goes? What is there in the mere act of baptism to remit sins I thinkyou will have   THlE INVESTIGATION.        403 Ij  to let that passage slide, for it certainly does nothing in your favor, unless you take it literally, which you know. would be worse than transubstantiation, or gnosticism. Let the Carthaginian age bear attestation to the error of such doctrine, maintained." At this juncture, many furtive glances were cast at the time-piece, which was ticking away moment by- moment, the hours marked on its dial plate. Dr. Boon, in sympathy for his friend and colleague, moved for an adjournment, which was readily assented to, and embraced. Though the subject was still unfin- ished, a suspension was consequent, as it was getting late; very near bordering on the hour of twelve. Mr. Sampson, as he walked home, seemed to be labor- ing under some pulmonary affection, for his rapid breath- ing, playing the dilatation on his nostrils, corroberates our suggestion, considerably. The cool fall winds, fanned his face, in cutting demonstrations, as he took up an un- pleasant, retrospective rumination. The beauties of the night sank into insignificance, as the engaging thoughts took possession of his heart. Mr. Sampson was not en- joying this mental feast, but rather indulged from a-sense of necessity. "Plague the look," he muttered half aloud, as he came to a very unpromising pointin his revery. "Who would have thought it?" he continued. "Who would have ever dreamed that I would let a little fry of a Baptist preacher get me down so? Certainly: Alexander Camp- bell must be mistaken in his theory! It seems, that, Weston anticipated every point in our favor, but I think I'll get him next time.

However, we know that the information goesfrom an oraculous source, therefore, we trust to its authenticity.                   .. CHAPTER XXIX. THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, IN WHCH IT IS PROVEN AGAIN, THAT BAPTISM CANNOT BE FOR THE REMSSION OF SINS, FOR, ( Whlsoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God."-I. John, v. 1. Out in the forest valley, far away from the noise of mankind, and surrounded by the rural scenes of child. hood's happy hours, Mr. Sumner had taken refuge. The same parental roof, which sheltered him in his happiest days, now bore him protection in the hour of affliction. His Sister,-Mrs. Bernard, was the only occupant of the homestead now, together with a few of old family ser- vants. A quiet reign was predominant. The summer days rolled into fall, bringing a crimson decoration, which soon gave way to a mass of seared leaves, deadening the relics of the preceding season., Mr. Simner had made numerous efforts to gain infor-  mation of Miss Bacon's whereabouts, but to no purpose. He had written to several points, letters of pathetic in- quiry, but the response was invariably in the negative. No such lady had been to any of the towns in which he had acquaintances. The case was, hopeless. Once his sister had serious apprehensions of the consequences, but thie bracinwinds of autumn, had a very salutary effect on his health ;so in less than two months from the time la, so i   .          m h tm   THE INVESTIGATION.        '405 he left M---, he was sufficiently resuscitated, to return to his field of labor. "I leave for home, to-morrow, Sister,"-he remarked, as he came in from a long walk, his face highly colored from exercise. "Not so soon, my dear brother!" she exclaimed. "The ride would set you back to where you were, when you came here. Now I beg you to defer it a month 'at-least. The air out here is so much more salubrious and healthy than at the place where you are going. And then, you will overtask your abilities by going to work again. Stay here, I beg you, until winter, and then you will be better recruited in body and mind, so your foundation of health will be more secure. Stay, will you not?" pleaded the anxious sister.             i "Ah, dear sister," he replied sadly, as to ever being' recruited in mind, I hold that blessing far off in anticipa- tion. You do not know the depths of my affection, nor can I begin to describe it. I thank you much for your kind entreaties and solicitations, but I must not stay here, idle, any longer. My Churches are now without a pastor, so I feel it strictly incumbent on me to hasten to them as soon as possible. There is nothing within my reach, sis- ter, that I could enjoy more than this quiet retreat, but duty calls, and I must obey." Mrs. Bernard wiped away a glistening tear, that had leaped its bounds, and stealthily wound its way down her cheek. Well did she remember the taste of sorrow, for she had been left a lonely widow, and grief-strickened, in an early day. This was why she remained at the almost deserted homestead, for she loved quietude. Mr. Sumner, although trying to wear a brave counte- nance, suffered, too, a recreant tear to 6scpoe his brimful eyes, for it was indeed a task for him to return to the spot of so many pleasant, as well as painful associations, . and fresh in memory, from their recent enactnients. But duty, stern duty, had issued the muanl ate, whoso abrogation was at the risk of his relentless inflictnments, so he bowed his head to the impending billows, deter- mining to brave the storm, though so destructive of his heart's happiness. There was' another incentive, so vague that he dared not treasure it up. It was the hope of hearing from An-u  &#xD;<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC8270-00000206"/> -4186     4LIANDlRD HALL. nie, at M---. Perhaps by being there, some clue to the retreat might be obtained in the course of time. These imaginations, fed by suggestive fancy, preyed at times on his brain. But when he looked realities in the face, all hope would vanish, leaving a dark blank, to shade his heart, and to close out the sunshine of youthful impetu- osity. "Charles," called Mrs. Bernard, after the pause of about twenty minutes., : "What is it sister?" he; asked, looking up anxiously. "I want to talk some with you, but am afraid." "Proceed sister, nothing that you will say will offend me, I assure you." "Then listen. I will ask you a question. May not your love. for Annie Bacon be imaginary after all?" "Sister!" "Be quiet," she commanded, seeing his astonishment, and- excitement. "But Sister, you"- "Not a word Brother. I know you are sincere, but remember how you have been treated. Is it not possible for you to conquer that love?" "Dearest Sister, how mistaken you are in my nature  Nor has Annietristreated me in the least. In an hour of excitement I said that no woman who would Jorget de- cency so far as to be dipped, colld ever be my wife! Alas, had the words died without utterance, it would have been better for me, though I don't know, for my Churches never would have consented to such a union in the world. Annie Bacon was as pure in the step she took, as the angels in Heaven could be. It was a matter of conscience with her, so I cannot blame her, though I think she was too hasty."  "Therefore, Charles, the necessity arises for you to conquer the love you now bear for her. She can never be yours, as you"- ' Oh! Sister, do not utter such words! You will drive me mad! I hope for better days." "And do you suppose they'll ever come Charles? An- nie will never retract, will you yield?" "Don't, don't picture the future so Sister. It is dark, all dark, and impenetrable, I do not try to peer through its dense veil. I have learned the true saying, 'Man pro-   THE INVESTIGATION.       - 407 poses; God disposes,' by sad experience, and now I think I understand its fill import. Excuse me, I am going down into the grove," he said, rising to Ils feet. lo  1Mrs. Bernard (id not prevent, for she saw that her brother was nluch excited, and she had strong faith in the, efficacy of the cool autumnal winds, which were sigh- ing through the thick embedded forest. According to arrangement, Mr. Sumner left his Sistcr's home the next morning, charged with cares and un- feigned solicitude for his health,and early return. On the previous night a cold rain had fallen, llich made the roads very splashy, and rendered the weather rather unpleasant. But this did not deter him from his jour- ney, for he was a man, who when he once set his heart on a purpose, seldom failed in its accomplishment, that is, when in the bounds of his power. As he rode along the deserted roads, it was hard to tell which pinched him the most, the stinging wind, or the pain of memory. Both were piercing, the latter the most accutely, we imagine. He began' to consider who was to blame in this 'his trouble. He would not lay the charge at Annie's door, for he felt that she was innocent. He could not blame her for the step she had taken, for his conscience on that score, was not entirely at ease. Despite of all efforts to feel satisfied, there would be an annoying tapping at the door of his heart, disturbing his rest. But then, he was com- fortably established, as the pastor of several Churches, and a sufficient income, together with the Pespect of a large community, constituting a very enviable position, and one not to be sacrificed so readily. Two weeks had elapsed at M-- since the last day of discussion. Preacher Sampson true to the proposition in his soliloquy, left the next morning, but at the expi- ration of the above time, returned, hoping to find the discussion over which th'ough Dr. Boon's instrunmntal- ity had been suspended, for he (Dr. Boon,) did not fee! competent to carry -it on by himself, nortdid he have strong faith in the orthodoxy of the doctripe he advoca- ted. The oak that stood firm a few mon'ths ago, was now shaken by the implacable storms, which has so re- cently swept over it. Dr. Boon felt the etfects sensibly, and was once, by force of circumstances, almost tempted  &#xD;<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC8270-00000207"/> 408       LEANDE B HALL. to bow his head and submit,' but pride, pride, pride in the garb of prejudice stood as a wall between him and such resolutions. Truth neveri triumphs hand in hand withpride and prejudice. Mark it. It is a fact un- scathed by all the wars of benighted ages. One of the two opposites must suffer martyrdom, before the other can reign. Look at the ages of punich tyranny! Mark the bloody footprints ofP those persecuted for conscience sake, and ask theo Alpine vallies, if pride in company with truth ever took refuge in their shades, and the reply would be, that "truth persecuted by pride and fanaticism, had come hither dfvested of that poison, but the latter was known only by reputation. Such is but a trace of the scarred and blurred pages of history. Ah! if one-third of the :direful persecutions of the persecuted Baptists, had been recorded, how much darker (if possible) would have been the pages of their history. A few centuries ago, and what was the garb of Truth? Blood! blood!- the forest's thirsty plains watered with the gore shed in defense of Truth! and, 'Watchman what of the night' now? Are not there signs of the same bloody drama to be enacted over? What means these dark and ominous clouds, which are gathering in the horizon of this age? Perhaps ere this goes to press, the Waldensian age will have dawned or. us! Watch the storm-king, he is not vanquished yet! buckle on your armour Christians, for behold mystic Babylon is recruiting her forces to battle with the Saints, under the generalship of the Beast, and 'the Church will again be compelled to flee into the wil- derness, whose bourne, our Saviour has long since pre- scribed, and will in time call her from hence, with the brightness of his appearing. "It is a great pity," said Mr. Weston, after the compa- ny had assembled again, to pursue the investigation, "that so long a time should intervene between the peri- ods of prosecution of this discussion. It suffers 'treach- erous memory to lose convictions, especially when one subject is ombraced. I hope sincerely, this may not be the case agaiei." Preacher Sampson took care to make no reply, for he keenly felt the reproof. "Where did we. leave off? asked Dr. Boon, wishing to divert attention from Mr. Weston's remarks, for he plainly saw who was to blame.   jj THE ITVESTIGATIoy.             409 "Mr. Sampson will give you the reference. I think I disposed of all his argument to his satisfaction, if not, ho has only to bring them up again," said Mr. Weston. Mr. Sampson, suited to the hint, took his little Camp- bellitic concordance from his pocket and began to look over it. Then he picked up the New Testament and brought up the following argument:- "'Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. And you, being dead in your sins, and the uncircpmcision of your flesh, hath he quicke6nd, together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses: blotting out the hand-writing of or- dinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross. "What a beautiful allusion is made here to circumci- sion-! The uncircumcision of the flesh is quickened by spiritual circumcision, that is, in being 'buried with him in baptism.' Baptism, or spiritual circumcision is repre. sented here as being the antitype of circumcision of the flesh. The old fleshy circumcision merely took off au atom of the flesh, but this new spiritual circumcision, this total circumcision cuts off the whole body of sins. If this passage does not teach remission of sins in baptism, then there is not a rpassage in the Bible that does," ended Mr. Samprlsol, bri n1ging his fist down on the table with an energy that would have done credit to a Samson. "1 think that text is a most conclusive proof," remark- ed Dr. Boon, somewhat established in the faith. "Nor can I conceive of anly way," he continued, "of getting around it. Certainly, A[r. Westou, you can but' let that pass as argument, for it is very conclusive." "I would, Doctor, buttI had rather take Paul's mean- ing thanu Mr. Sampson's construction. In speaking of uncircumcision of the. flesh, if he meant baptism as the spiritual circumcision, it would be another thing, but we have only to read the preceding verse to find out what he substitutes for circumcision. Will you read it, Mr. Samp- son? You have the book." Mr. Sampson complied. ,' n wwhom also ye are circumcised With the circumci- sion made without hands, iin putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ."' 35 \  &#xD;<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC8270-00000208"/> "O.      LEANDHR   AtLL. l"Now I ask you, does the circumcision spoken of there, look like baptism?" "Why-I don't--that is, I cannot see that it does not mean baptism," was the hesitating reply. "And yet that circumcision is effected ' without hands,' and is ' of Christ'! Is baptismn made 'without hands'? I leave you to reconcile your doctrine with Paul's, for I cannot. But what is circumcision ' without lhands'? It is a renovation of the heart; hence the exhortation, 'Circumcise the fore-skin of your hearts.' Spiritual cir- cumcision which you would have to be baptism, is a niw heart made 'without hands,' and baptism the emblem. There is not a word in this passage about remission of sins through baptism. The Apostles firstdescribed the spiritual circumcision which was, made 'without hands,' and which is the thing signified,' tlen he gives the em- blem, hich is: 'Buried with him in baptism, wherein, also ye are risen with him through the flitl of the ope- tion of God, who has raised hm from the dead.' The inspired writers often connect the emblem and the thing signified. If you contend, Mr. Sampson, thlat the spirit- ual circumcision here spoken of, is baptism, then you must admit what Pedobaptist want, viz: That bap-tism came in the room of circumctision! This you will not do. so you are forced to acknowledge that circlumcision 'made. without hands,' was the circumcision of the heart and not of the bbdv. t"By turning to Ps. LT., we have,'Purge me wit hysop and I shall be clean : wasi me, and I slall be whiter than snow.' To find the meaning of this prayer of DL)vil, we-have only to turn to Leviticus xiv, and we learn tlat the ceremonially unclean, were cleansed by sprinkling blood upon them, with hysop, ccdar-wood, and scarlet. In reference to this ceremony, David prayed: 'Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spiri t witlhi me.' Here,.according to your theory, the purging with hysop would have done all necessary cleuasing, but David prayed fora new hleart, also. We- see that thisi O emblem and the thing signified, are connected. To take a literal view of the emblem, would bee quivalent to hysop purging in reality from sin, and so baptism. TI1t1 'foimer is' nioless incongruous than the latter. In conclu- sion, I would say, if you depend on that passage to prove   ,.If     THE IN  ESTIGATIsON.       4" that the believing penitent is yet condemned, if not bap. !,  tized, your case is certainly a hopeless one. You bap. tize only those who repent -and believe, so yon say, now  if you will show me one passage within the lids of the Bible, where the believing penitent is not saved unless baptized, I will give it up, and also promise to shows you a number of cases where persons were saved, Without baptism, 'by grace through' faith' in the Lord Jesus Christ, the only plan of salvation for- men. We are told that faith is the 'victory that overcometh the world.' Certainly, if a man has faith and can overcome the world, ie is not condemned; because he has not been baptized." "But, sir, you speak: of baptism as though it had no divine purposes," protested Dr. Boon. "It certainly has its purpose, Doctor, of which I havo given my opinion before now, but it is not for the remis- sion of sins, in the sense in which'yon take it or thou- sands of good and pious souls; die, and go to perdition! together with infants! idiots! and all irrelsponsibles! for God has never given but one redenmption for man, and that is ' by grace,' the blood 'oft Christ, slied as the pro- curing cause, and the IIoly Spirit as the ffcients. agent, of' which water baptism is the significal t emblem. I am -ready now to hlear your next proof, for the last lhas left no impression." Preachler Sampson scratched his head again, and glanced at his concordance. "'Not by works of righteousnlcs3 which we have done, but according to his-mercy, ihe saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Glhot; which he. sled on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ, our Sa- viour; that being justified by his grace, we mirght be made heirs, according to the hope of eternal life.' (Tit. "i: 5.) "This passage needs no comment. All will concur with me, that the 'washing of regeneration' means 'bap- tism." "Which makes the Gospel a watery salvation!" inter- rupted Mr. Weston. This discomfited : the clampion of Campbellism' no little, though amidst such, hle was forced to rally. . "But you must admit, sir, that it means baptism.   &#xD;<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC8270-00000209"/> "2 .LEANDER HALL. Most all Commentators of any note, agree on this point." "Yet I will not grant my ready consent to such a con- struction, since baptism is not mentioned in express terms, and since there are so much argument against baptism being for the remission of sins. There is argument agaist that notion in the identical chapter. The Apos- tle tells that we are not saved by our ' works of righteous- ness which we have done,' but according to his mercy, and bv his grace. Now, no rational man will deny, but baptism constitutes a portion of those works, therefore it is not by baptism or any other performance of ours, that we are saved, but by grace; consequently the 'washing of regeneration' cannot mean baptism, unless you can make baptism the grace of God!! by which we are 'jus- tified!'  "But sil, in examining the New Tertameut, we find /that a man is said to be 'justified by faith! 'justified free- tly, by his grace,'--'justified by his blood,'-'justified by works,-'justified in, or by the name of the Lord Jesus,- 'justiffied b Cis,"j fi by bknowledge,'-and 'It is God that justifies.' Now here are seven ways of justifica- "tion, ald one is 'by works,' and we are--"  "Allow me here to speak. I think we disposed of that 'justification by works,' at our last meeting, satis- factorily; at least you made no complaint." Mr. Sampson remembered the circumstance, therefore, he forbore any further allusion. "F6r fe-r that some one may take your suggestion for argument," contiinuled Mr. Weston I will merely say that the Apostle James was addressing the Church as to its deeds of charity; that is, that justification by works, was the -justification in the sight of the Church, and not of God; or rather the 'works' formed the basis by - which the Christian was to be judg1ed, whether of deeds orv ords; having no reference whatever to the urging -of sinners to the necessity of ' works' for salvation, conse- qelntly, it had- nothing to do with baptism for the remis- sion of sins: 'For by qgrace are ye saved through faith; and t hat not of yourselves, it is. a gift of God: NOT OF WomRK, lest any man should boast;'--we are justified in the :sigit of God, and saved, by FAITH; but by works, we :are justified in-the sight of the Church." Mr. Sampson began to peruse industriously, the little   ':{ \i     TITE iNVESTIGATION.       -413  . concordance which he kept before him, knowing that it would be useless to attempt a refutation of Mr. Weston's argument. He turned over several leaves, and read, and re-read, with now and then a frown passing over his countenance.  The Reformers present, manifested unmi takeAble signs of uneasiness, for their pastor. Dr. Boon, moved his chair somewhat closer, as if to give assistance physi- cally, if not mentally. A fearfil thought rushed through his brain once. Perhaps Mr. Sampson had come to the end of his row! But no; just then his face brightened up, and he laid the concordance aside for the Bible. There was hope, however vague, which is never deserted as long as visible. Peter, the aged seer," began Mr. Sampson, confirms our doctrine as conclusively as language could express. Iear him (iii: 19): 'By which also he went and pIre;ch- ed unto the spirits in prison, which sometimes were diso- bedient,;whet, once the lonrg-suffcring of God,) waited in the days -of Noah, while tire ark was preparing, i4herein few, that is, cight souls, were saved by water. The like figure whereiunto, even baptism, dot Italso 11ow save us. (not the putting away of the fiith of the flesh, but the answer of the good conscience towards God,) by the res- urrection of Jesus Christ.' Sir, if this -docs not teach baptism for the remission of sitis, what language could be employed that would? Can we conceive of any? We began with Peter, and we here end with him. No man can fail to see the true imnport of this Apostle's teachings. 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins,' says lie, in the opening of the great drama, but when the aged seer be- gan to wax old, he renews the blessed assurance that bap- tism now saves us, like the water did the ' eight souls.'" "You must remember also, Mr. Sampson, that water drowned more than 'eight souls' at the same time; there- fore the virtue of salvation wal not in the water, so you must admit. You will not deny, but it was in God, I presume." "Of course in God," was the ready concession. "So Peter terms it (water) as a 'figure,' and says that baptism: is a similar figure, or 'the like figure whereunto,' &amp;e. A-the virtue of eaglvtiou to Noah's family was not  &#xD;<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC8270-00000210"/> "4        LEANDER HALL. in the water, (for many were drowned at the same time,) but in God, so the water is the figure of God's power, and tlhe peolle's-salvation, and baptism, to believirng penitents, is also a figure and sign. It does not save us, really, but it is a 'filure'! -Tle figure is never the tiling signified, as every one will admit. Emblem and figure are synony- mous; the thing for which I have been contending. Pe- ter also tells us that it is not water ibaptism that saves us ' not the putting away of the filthl of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God '-or rather obe- dience to God's commands, and an emblem of the inward grace, antl constituting a 'figure' of that salyatiotn. Sir, I cannot make any more of this, unless the Apostle had had the forethought to have left out the word 'figure,' and unless you could erase from the pages of the Bible, these saying--'IeI that believeth on him, is not condemned' And 'He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life.' And 'Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Son of God, is born of God.' They- are all expressed without qualifi- cation. Now I want to ask you a question. Do you be- lieve that all believers are begotten of God?" "Certainly v. "So also admits Alexander Campbell. Now, born and begotten, you must also ad-nit, are synonymous terms.' ' Yes sir, I believe that is generally understood. Bro. Alexander Campbell, if I mistake not, in his translations, most invariably translates the word begotten, instead of born'." "T Then let it be remembered that he and you believe that whosoever is begotteitof God, enjoys the remission of sins. Now if the words are used synonymously, let us see, substituting the word begotten, (as it denotes remission). "' Whosoever is begotten (born) of God, doth not com. mit sin; his seed renaineth in lim: and he cannot sin, because lie is begotten (born) of God.' There is no equiv. ocatioir here, or qualification. If he is begotten, he is pardoned(-born of God, whether baptized or not! "A'gain: 'Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is beqotten of God'-enjoys remission, whether baptized or not. ",Again: 'Whosoever is begotten of God, overcometh the world'-if begotten he is born, if born he enjoys re- p1   ,   '   j         TTE -INVESTIGATION.     415 ;!  mission. Now what has our Saviour promised to those    'who overconme the world? 'To him that overconeth, will I give to cat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God'! (Rev. ii: 7.) "I -will make no more quotations- on this point, deem- iln what I have said sufficient. I have proven by your -   own ladmission, that lie that is begotten enjoys remission, and that begotten and born are synonymous terms, as trans- latel by the Executive head of your denomination."  Mr. Sampson know that it was the truth, hence he made no denial.    "But one more point I would bring up here. If bap- tism be for rcnissiou of sins, where was the necessity of Christ's blood? And what has become of the thous- anl(s of Christians who have died unbaptized, and also, of those who were never immersed into thatfaith? Tho Waldense3, the Albigenses, the 'Vaudois, the Petrobrus- sions, and others, of Peidmont valley, what is their final doom? Were they'baptized into the faith of remission, through water? If they were not baptized into a proper faitil, their baptism would answer no more than the bap- tism of' certain disciples whom Paul found at Ephesus, and whom lie re-baptized because they had been baptized into the faith of Christ's coming, when he had already come, and iad completed the scheme of redemption on the cross. What has become of the pious'-of all ages, who lived and died prior to Barton Stone's discovery in 1804?! SMust all be condemned, because they were not baptized for the remission of sins? And are there more p lans of salvation than one? I hope, sir, some of you Campbcellites will answer these questions satisfactorily, or admit that your doctrine is the most sectarian and illibe- ral in the world-at least very inconaistent with facts." The advocates of Campbellism present, looked very wildly at each other, for Mr. Sampson had been their leader, and had always preached just as 'their fathers, Stone and Campbell, dictated, not daring to presume on tlhe oracularity of the doctrine emanating from these sources. One struggle, and Dr. Boon gave up the theory. He had never taken such a view of the last passage quoted; the idea of "figures" had never reached him; having always considered the last reference to Peter as incon-  &#xD;<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC8270-00000211"/> y1t^V   -   u j A' U ' j -. M  - * A t6stthle proof. So he had been informed froi 'the' plpit; was he to' blame? The thing had been proclaim- ed and preached over again, until like the lawyer,: the declaimers had succeeded in making many of their hear- ersdbelieve it, whether it was true or not. Some one may siy, men ought to g to the Bible for themselves. Very true, they ought, but men are not likely to do it when  there is an easier way held out to learn of the scriptures. Therefore, a weighty responsibility rests on each ex- pounder of the sacred oracles of God. And let those who only take a one-sided view, take care that there be no stain of blood on their garments at- the day of their tribunal, remembering that God hath said: "He that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully." But to the subject. After a pause of several minutes, which was exceed- ingly embarrassing, Mr. Weston continued.  'There is another strenuous objection I have to the doetrine of 'baptism for the remission of sins,' and one that admits of no qualification. It is, that the doctrine ! under consideration, ascribes unscriptural importance and efficacy, to an external ordinance. The sacred Word of God, uniformly teaches, and represents the religion of the heart as the only thing essential in salvation. When Saul returned from his war with the Amalekites, bring- ing from the spoils many sheep and oxen, he intended to sacrifice to God, so he excused himself, and upon that avowal, tie inspired Samuel proclaimed a glorious truth, which characterized the Bible throughoutt: 'Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat  of rams.' -1 Sam..xv: 22. David, in that pmenitential Psalm, di.) gives utterance to the same truth: 'For thot desirest not sacrifice, else I would give it: thonude- lightest not in .burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a brokentispirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. Yet, according to - our doctrine, such sacrifices would be repudiated unless baptized! From Geniesis to Revelations, the religion of the -heart is-described as the one thing needfiil, and nowhere insep-: arably connected with external ordinances. But do not urderstand me to repudiate any external orditnance wzhiich Girist'haascommaiided, 'but understand me to: mean -that thiey belong only to th'ds who have been pardoned, :aid a   accepted by God, who are consequently obligated to s obey his commands. If it be true that 'He that believeth on him is not condemned,' then the sinner is parldoned and accepted before you can get him into the water, in spite of your efforts to the contrary."  "I know your argument is verly good Mr. Weston, but Peter has made baptism essential, and so do I. He said: 'Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ve shall receive the Holy Ghost.' The language is so clear and explicit that it will admit of no interpretation." "Well Mr. Sampson, granting you that baptism is for  the remission of sins, what does that prove for you? Does not the preposition express 'alute receed, as well as value to be received?T For instance, a man borrows a thousand dollars from me, and gives a receipt for it, does not the word for express value received? And is it im- possible for it to be the case in the text referred to? Is it impossible that baptism be administered for remission of which the recipient was already in 16ossession? No; it is not."  "But Mr. Weston, baptism for remission, means, in order to obtain remission." "You have not, nor cannot, prove that. I will grant that baptism is for the remission of sins, but contend that the p eposition means the value receired, and not for what is to be received. I contend that baptism is not the procurative, but because of. During our discussion oil this point, I have made but a small effort to disprove the sig- nification of '.for,' allowing you full latitude inr order that you might prove your point, but even with that privilege you have failed; now I contend, and have proven conclusively, in almost a hundred different ways, that baptism is not the procuiative of remission, conse- quently, being for remission, is nothing more than because of, or for remission already reeeived! This you cannot disprove, though granted unlimited privileges."  Mr. Sampson hardly knew what response to make to Mr. Weston's exposition. Casting a look of anxious in- quiry around, he said: "I venture to say sir, you cannot find an- instance in the NewTestament, where a main has any assurance of remission of sins without baptism,"  ,  &#xD;<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC8270-00000212"/> "You have forgotten the thief on the cross, certainly,'" reminded Mr. Weston. "He was promised by our Sa- viour that he should be with him in paradise on the same day." "  Oh, but the grand commission was not given then. I will linuit my assertion. I will say tlat baptism iS con- sidered no where as non-essential. It is always comr manded after faith, that is on tlis side of the grand com- mission; It is always reckoned as a-part of lihe Gospel." "And'yet you remember that the-oApostle Paul tells us that the gospel was preached to Abralam and dom- patriarchs." "I know, but I am' speaking of the time after the commission to baptize was given."  4"Well. if you persist, I will give proof directly oppo- site to your assertion." "Well do, for I insist. I feel confident that you can- not do it," was the unshaken protest. "You have the Testament; turn to 1 Cor. i: 17th verse." Mr. Sampson obeyed, feeling assured that there was nothing there that could make against him. The place was found, and he read: "' For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.'  Hada thunderbolt fallen at the preacher's feet he could not have betrayed more astonishment! The Cainbellite brethren present were paralized. The effect was elecetrie, and the text needed no coimment. "If baptisni was cssentiAl to salvation, why did Paul talk thus? Did he not plant Churches? and carry thle gospel to the Gentiles? Had baptism been esseltial, methinks he could not have separated it flromn the gospel. But blessed be that saying: '.He that believeth on the So0. hath everlasting life.' lie is born of God,' not of the will of the flesh,' but 'from above'-wh ether he hath entered the visible kingdom of God or not, but he believes on the Son, and ' hath everlasting life.' God is the autthor and finisher of this salvation, it is not dependent on an act of man, which is to be performed by another, like1 baptism; but 4^He that believeth on him is no(t coll- demned! Then to him ascribe all honor and glory, tor   'salvation is of the Lord.' Let philosophers build as many schemes of remission as they please, and clothe them in their home-made shillbolethic I and nmarkls, bnt as long as we have the Holy Writ to gulide us, we will ever contelld, that by grace we are saved through faith, and that ' Salvation is of the Lord,' to whom we ascribe all honor and glory forever.  "We have, Mr. Sampson, had a very lengthy discus- sion on this question; whereby we 1have fiould a false doc- trine taught in your Church, and tlis discovery w'as made by a fair test. Since I am told to hold nlo t'ellowshhi1 with those who keep not the ordinances as delivered, and who commit 'offences' alnd teaclh false doctrines, I must re- fuse to commune with you on these grounds, for: 'I be- seech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences coitrary to the doctrinle which ye 1lave re- ceived, and AOID them.' (Rom. xvi: 17.) Ohl tlat every Baptist in the land, would hold this entreaty in remem- brance!" When Mr. Weston closed, the company dispersed. CHAPTElR XXX. AN EXTRACT FROM MR.

But as the receding  &#xD;<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC8270-00000213"/> 420       LEANDESR UAJU- sun gave one farewell glance over the hills, he rode in the town that had been the theatre of so many painful scenes, os forestallments of happiness. Casting a deprecating look at Leander Hall, he won- dered if its inmates were as gloomy as the outside ap- pearance of things seemed to be. Dr. Boon was the first man he met. At meeting each other, both involuntarily halted. "And so you have returned, recruited?' said the doc- tor, giving his hand a hearty shake. "I feel better than I did when I left M---, but I lack much of being well, yet," replied Mr. Sumner, sadly. After exchanging a few remarks the young preacher hastened to broach the: subject nearestto his lieart. "Have you received any intelligence here, of Miss Bacon, Doctor," was the anxious interrogation. "None, only Miss Weston is in receipt of a letter from her, though as to her whereabouts, I know nothing." "Have oull seen Miss Weston, since then?" he pursued th thee with -i nfeigncd solicitation. "I have not," was the 4lnsatisfactory reply. "Do you know of anything that was in the letter?" "Nothing at all." "How long has it been since she received it?" he per- sisted in the inquiry. "I cannot say. I am told, however, that Miss Wes- ton is not at liberty to make any revelation concerning Miss Bacon."  '  But would she not to me?" he asked eagerly. "I cannot say. You lhad better see her." I1 vill," and they parted. Accordingly the next day, Mr. Sumner called to see Mollie Weston, pleading in pathetic tones for a place in r the secrecy, but it happened that Annie had placed more unqualified strictures on Mollie's privileges as regarded that point, so she was forced to deny the. supplicant his Wish. How sadly he returned to his lonely domicile, after that failure! Previously he had entertained a fancied visitor! -Hope! but now as he turned from Mr. Weston's thresh- old, despair was hi comp:ay instead. nRmor had gotten afloat, some how, that Miss Lankin- stou knew all about the matter. Some one, who profess-   TUII INVEST-IGATION.      .421 ed to have received it from unquestionable authority, said "that she was in possession of a letter from Annie. This reached Mr. Sumner's ears. lie thought it strange that Annie should have written to Miss Lankinston, as there was no intimacy between them; but such objections were overcome by his anxiety, so he began to trace the source of the report. No one could tell how he or she heard it, but all knew that it was so. He sat down, the evening he heard the intelligence, and addressed a note to that lady, which ran thus: Miss - LANKINSTON: There is a matter of importance, on which I would like to talk with you a short time. Any hour that you can grant me your company, will be convenient to me, and appropriate. Please defer it no longer than possible. "Very respectfully, yours, &amp; , "A. C. SUMNER." She received the note, and read and re-read it, until by memory she could repeat every word. What a flutter it caused in her heart, for, reader, she had misapprehended the significance! An answer was made, granting the request that even- ing at seven o'clock. All was excitement with her now, and her toilet was in progress early in the evening, so by dark, she was, (to use the lph rase,) dressed. She took a book, and tried to while away the moments wlich intervened between the completion of her task and the time for his arrival, but her thoughts could not be di- verted from the all-absorbing theme. Finally she yield- ed to a blissfll soliloquy. ' Perhaps I oughu to have consulted my Aunt before I made , n answer, but that. don't matter. I am a woman of my own head, and I'll have my way about these things. I wonder what he'll say first? It will be, I guess, 'Miss  Lankinston '-no, that is too formal for a lover.

( But tell me," hle continued, ' right now, how long have you-" ' Several mnonth," was the interrupting reply. "And now," said he, takiig her hand, "are you willing to confide in me? for you know not of my anxiety.

Thank you!" ie exclaimed, seizing her hand again. "But proceed," still blissfully ignorant of her design. "I lhave cherished hope, silently," she proceeded, 'for three lo1ng monlths, wlhel I heard of your engagement with Allnie Bacon, I felt like I too had 4- part to act in that drama." Mr. Sumner could not divine why she went back to those events, but he only pressed her to continue. She did so. "WhbenI heard that you and Annie had had a falling out, I then felt that my time was at hand. Then I began to hope. (Hcr language was still a mystery.) I have waited patiently for this avowal which you have made to-n ight, and now Iradil ve   y  rt and hand in marriage, hoping that the love webear for each other may be a safeguard to us against the storms of life such as .you:hmie had to battle with, heretofore."

His limbs trembled and almost refused to sipport him. He made   THEl INVESTIGATION.        423 an effort to speak, but nothing but a gutteral rattling -sounded in his throat. Miss Lankinston knew not what to make of his strange manners. "Be seated, Mr. Sumner! Are you ill?" she asked noting the lividness of his countenance. "You have grossly mistaken my motives, Miss Lankin- ston," he atl]ast summoned courage to say. "How?" she asked quickly, not comprehending. "I did not come here tto-night to make a declaration of love, but I came to-" A scream interrupted him. She now understood him, and motioned him from her presence. He obeyed, and she was again left alone to indulge unmolested, in a soli- loquy, whch was indeed quite unlike the one interrupted by M1r. Slumner. IIc blet lhis way homeward, shocked, surprised, aston- ished, conltoinded, and mortified, if indeed these words can express his sensations. His ir st thought was to get a friend to go and make lan explanation, but second thought told him of the error of suill a plan, for it would be lettingo others into the secret whichl should be kept still. He then wisely concluded to address her a note, explaining the cause of his visit, and still asking for the information so much desired. As soon as he got his breakfast the next morning, he sat down and carried his resolution into execution. Be- forlie le was aware of it, he had written a long letter, characterized by regrets for the misfortune, and hopes of beigi friends agairn. He then sought some one to carry it., According to direction, a boy deposited it in Miss Lankinston's lap, who sat by a window looking very pale and angry. She read and returned the letter unanswer- ed. This was no more than Mr. Sumner anticipated, but he felt that it was his duty to make some apology. Irli discussion was delayed again, two or three weeks, on the account of the illness of one of the party who was very anxious to be present at its prosecution. During which time, preacher Sampson and Dr. Boon had a con- versation that comes under the scope of this narrative, so we will relate it.   ,  "I thik, Bro. Sampson, there must be some mistake about this theory. I regard it now as a flat contradiction 1.               .  .'  &#xD;<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC8270-00000215"/> 't 4=^A      LE- AN D  H It iA LX . of the unqualified teachings of the Bible.

"Tut, tut, tut, lt, Doctor, you are going to be led off by that fellow Weston, now." "No, no; I llave never heard&amp;him say a word on this point. lie did not resort to analysis or philosophy to sus- tain himself, but I think stuck as closely to the-Bible as any one could." ' Do you hear that?! You are gone Doctor! Weston has you ruiled!"  "Not nt all, Bro. Sampson. I am seeking after truth unalloyed by partisanis m, and untouched by human con- tamination. Now, if baptism is not for remission of sins, then where am1 I?

Dr. -Boon examined the idiom qulestion of Hebrew, arnd Greek, whic confirmed liis belief. lie saw that many singlular expressions of the New Testament were idiomat- ic, and thence he was enabled to account for the pecu- liarity of style which Peter adopted on thl day of Pen- tecost. Would that every one, who believes in baptism for the remission of sins, would do likewise! -' How much delusion and error such a course might forestall. Miss Lankinston's angcrr, instcad of subsiding on re- flection, only grew more obdurate and intense, if possible. She vowed revenge, and well did she execute helr vow. Time had given her courage to carry on the work.    "Yes," she cogitated, as she walk'ed the floor, after his departure, "Yes, he shall repent of this, the longest day he lives! Iwill haunt him with annoyances, like a ghost. He shall pay every tittle of this doubly. But how shall I accomplish it?" she asked herself, haltilg at the same time in hesitancy. "I have it! Helshall pay the debt to the Church! Yes, I'll see him writhe in mortifjing ago- ny before the world, and he shall kneel-again to priests and bishops, and swear obedience!" Such Were her resolutions, reader, and before such, one might cringe. A woman's anger, when aroused to re- venge, cannot be evaded.

The instigatress marked her success with malicious satisfaction, never fitiling to authenticate rumors, which very naturally started, whether there was the least foun- dation fbor them or not.              - Annie Bacon's motives for leaving  the Methodist Church lhad been' canvassed and re-canvassed, a kdozen time%, by the female population of M--, at every dectision afttrilbuted to some uncommendable cause; some saying it was the resiult of aberration, others heresy, and others, 4 owing to Mr AVcston's influence; but now a new sub- ject for tallingl, presented itself, of a more entertain- ing character, for it gave room for speculation and pre- diction, an exercise inl which women love to engage. It was whi:lpeed, (not in an undertone, for. M'rs.

After dwelling on several prelimri- nalry points for a while, the speaker came to Faith, as termed Eoanglelical. And here we will give- a slight ex- tract for the bediefit of the reader. "i Faith is a comprehensive term, and 'Eoantelical .j ith has two components. 1st. The assent; 2d. reliance. They are inseparable to its composition. Tl'le lecrec assent of the mind alone is not Evangelical faith, or tihe 'saving faith' so denominated by inspireLl writers, for Sinmo, th:e sorcerer,' believed,' we aretold, tndl yet s eer said, le was ifi the 'gall of bitterness and the bond of in- iquity.'

Repent therefore, of this thy wickedness, and p1ray God, if perhaps the thoughl of thine heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and the bond oj iniquity.'-(Acts viii: 21-23.) "':Evangqelieal faith begets lose to God and' his people. Whllere is the true Christian, who does not. love God? Wlere is the Christian that can contemplate the great deed of the cross, without feeling hs heart- to -iverflow with love, gratitude, and compassionate symlathy for Iimi who breathed his litfe away; iin blood and agony, with the sins of a world, bound to; his mortal fiame?! Ah, my brethren! wheli I beolold m Saiour ding, ith all my sins nailed with his body to the cross, what emotions of inexprecssible love and gratitude, swell my bosom. 3Behold1lhe bleeds! bleeds! yet bleeds the succor of mn soul! Can I but love lint? Look wlhat lie has done ftor me! 'For wlhen we were yet without strength, in due time, Cihrist died for the ungodly.' Yes, brethren, he' died for us as the ungodly. As David said, 'I was shapeu in iiiquity, and in sin did my nlother conceive me,' but 'God conlmandeth his love towards us, in that, while e wewere yet sinners, Clrist died for us. Much nore then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath, through him.'-(Rom. v. 6, 8, 9.) Thus ihe loved us, and in. return, the Christian will love Him. 'Hc thlat loveth not, kuoweth not God; for God is love,' for-' Though I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. Atid though I have the gift of prophecy nd u-nderstand all mysteries, and all knowledge and, though I have all faith, so that I could remove nlountains, and have not love, I am nothing; and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and thouIgh I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth nie nothing.

"AAgain: Where is the Christian that does not love God's people-the bretnren? We are told that: 'We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.' What an unction we have!? We must love one another! Then ' beloved, let us love one another: i 'for love is of God; and eveiy one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God;-herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son, the propitiation of our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.'. For,'if we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.' Brethren, do we love each other as we ought? Let each one ponder this question well, in his heart. If we still bear hatred for one another, remember we yet 'abide in death.' "Evangelical Faith begets piety. Show me one who trustingly reliesaon the blood of Christ for salvation, and there you will find one whose piety justifies his profes- sion. Brethren, 'Let no man deceive you; he that-doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.' Brethren, when we see a man, who professes to have faith, and not works to show, his faith is ' dead;' it is not the Evangelical faith, which begets love, piety, and obedience. Not that the merit of these three save us, but they are consequent on faith, without them, faith is dead. In short, they are the talismen by which faith is to be tested; or rather, 'shw me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.'

Faith, Love, Piety, and Obedience are in- separably connected. Our Saviour has repeatedly told us, that if we love him, we must keep his command- ments. 'And he that keepeth his commandments dwel. leth in him, and he in him. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his command: ments are not grievous.' Show me one who says that he is born of God, and  repudiates knowingly, his commandments, and then I will point you one who never knew God, and who yet 'abideth in death.' For: 'By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.' So: 'Blessed are they thatc do his commandments, that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.'-Rev. xxii, 14. "Evangelical faith ' is the gift of God.'-Ephe. 2: 8,- a quickening by divine power. The sinner is represented as being spiritually 'dead,' and God 'quickens' or 'creates' him anew by, the power of Grace 'through faith,' the faith being consequent. We cannot of our own will turn and prepare ourselves for this stage of faith, but this is effected through the immediate agency of the Holy Spirit, as directed by God. This is called the spir- itual birth, and he who. experiences such is 'born from above.' 'Not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, (the carnal mind,) nor of the will of man, but of God.' -Be- cause, the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.' Rom. 8: 7. And,' The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither in- deed can be;' hence we contend that Evangelical or sav- ing faith, is not the'mere assent of the carnal mind, nor of the will of man, but 'is the gift of God,' and the faith which 'overcometh the world.' "If 'Evangelical faith' were merely the assent of the mind, then we must conclude, that Simon the sorcerer, and others of that character, were true believers, conse- quently saved, for we are told that Simon believed and was baptized but as Peter tells us that such are still 'in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity,' we must con- clude that some other faith, or nature of faith is necessa- ry; such a belief of thegospel, by the power of the Spirit if   1.

"This is the qualifying, but not meritorious condition, to which the promise of God annexes justification: that without which, justification would not take place, and in this sense it is that we are justified by faith; not by the merit of faith, but by faith instrumentally as this condi- tion: the connection of, the benefit arising from the merit of Christ and the promises of God. Hence: 'For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of your- selves, it is the gift of God.' "Then 'Evangelical faith,' is perfect reliance and con- fidence in Christ as our Saviour, looking for pardon and justification through his blood, knowing that we ourselves can do nothing of merit, and that He is all in all, having made a complete atonement for the sins of his people in his own body on the cross. To this faith God brings us by his own power, and this faith, we are enabled to keep, r  by his power. Brethren, if you are depending on other merit than this portrayed, with Peter I say: ' Thou art yet in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.' 'For mar- vel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be. born again,' for 'except a man be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God'-he cannot discern spiritual things, because he 'is dead in trespasses and sins;' and his 'mind is enmity against God;' therefore no man can come to God, 'except the Father draw him.'-(John 6, ".) 'So then, neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the in- crease.' The last passage plainly implies that if the conversion of souls were left to mere human agencies and the Word, nothing effective would result. Then oh! let us pray more earnestly for that grace which quickens the heart! Let us pray confidently, remembering that he hath said: 'Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name, he shall give it you.' In the language of the'Apos- tie: 'I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,-be made for all men--I will there- fore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting!'

Our faith is growing lukewarm from inaction, then let us pray confidingly and earnestly for a season of 'refreshing,' which through the holy prophets of old, God has told, should be given." Anad he closed! Dr. Boon sat spell-bound. Every word had reached his heart. In the twinkling of an eye he saw the errors in which he had fallen. What a hallu- cination had enshrouded his brain heretofore! And who built that self-complacent temple in which he had been worshipping all that time? Ask those who have been grasping after shadows, instead of substances, and who have substituted the Word for the Spirit; and water for blood! At their door lie these. delusions, and on their shoulders- will many sins be found. The Church closed, and Dr. Boon sought his home alone, evading several opportunities of accompanying those who were disposed to deride the theory brought under consideration. He resolved not to hear any such conversations, but ini this, his purpose was thwarted, for he had hardly emerged from the vestibule, before a brother Reformer accosted him with this inquiry: (Well, Doctor, he has been giving it to us, but I feel perfectly sanguine.

I "I certainly endorse the latter part of his sermon."' ' "Which was a humbug." "If it was, the Bible is too, for it, certainly embraced   Bible doctrine." "Tut, tut, Doctor, what are you coming to? the Church will have to deal with you." "The Church had better deal with the members who have gone back to the beggarly elements of the world, than with me, because I am trying to do right. Look at the state in which our Church is now! Out of two P  hundred members, only about thirty remain, and they were all very moral individuals before joining us. What has our religion done towards correcting the morals of the younger population?

From whence pro- ceed this fornication, drunkenness, revelry, and debauch- ery, that nightly invade our town? It, I am sorry to say, is principally from the members of our own Church. ' Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them,' brings to our mind that something is lacking. Well do I re- member a conversation which is recorded as occurring between one of the great founders of our doctrine, and an old school-mate. When Bro. Campbell was expa- tiating on the beauty of our system, and its great success, the old school-mate replied: ' Alexander, you may get them into your society, but you can't discipline them, for they will sting like hornets. Nothing but the Holy * Spirit will geal us, unto the day of redemption.' How much truth is in this saying, and how thoroughly verified by the history of our Church! Believe me, Bro.'Mavfield,noth- ing shorter than being, born of the Spirit, separate and distinct from material source, will ever hold our Church together.

Mr. Mayfield was invited to go in, but he had had enough of Dr, Boon's strange views, so he declined, saying that his wife would be wait- ing dinner,-a very convenient excuse, by-the-way. Mr.- Mayfield had as much for mental digestion, as he could well bear.                ;  "How are the sins to be remitted, which have been com- nitted since baptism, if baptism be for the remission of past sins?" was his mental inquiry, as he walked home-  ward. "But, tut, tut; all this thing about the Holy Spirit, and its miraculous influence is a humbug. All we have got to do, is, to believe that Jesus is the Christ, (this in, fact, I never doubted,) and'be baptized, then our sins are remitted. Yet I had rather be on the safe side of the question.

"Good mornin' Massa Mayfield," replied the polite ne- gro, doffing his hat. How do you feel now, Andrew? Do you think you have been pardoned since, baptism? What do you keep sinning for, here of late? Why don't you try to do bet- ter? do- as you did the first few daysafter baptism. "CLan't, Massa Mayfield, can't, can't.

If you doubt it, cast your memory to your knowledge of Reform preachers, which, if very exten- sive, will thoroughly verify our assertion. We once knew one who declared that he did not belong to any Church at all, that the Church recognizable, was noth- inghut a human invention. Another, who did not be- lieve in future punishment, and another who believed that man still possesses his primeval holiness; the doc- trine of human depravity being denounced. Such are a few specimens authenticated by personal knowledge, can we wonder at their "fruits"? CHAPTER XXXI.

BOON made himself busy in the prosecution of the discussion, which had been suspended by insurmounta- ble obstacles. Two weeks more, and he communicated to Mr. Weston that the coterie would convene at his residence on the following evening after tea. This was Sabbath evening when-he called to deliver the announce- : ment. .f    TEE INVESTGATa   ION.      441 I   He soon informed Mr. Weston of his business with him, and very significantly asked if Miss Molhe was at iome.  Mr. Weston took the hint, and left the room, sending his daughter in after him. So Dr. Boon, a "'lucky dog," killed two birds that evening, with one stone, taking care to hold the greatest pleasure in reservation for the last.  By-the-way, he had become a very frequent visitor at the Baptist preacher's house, there being some greater attraction there, than the mere contents of theological works, or the oracular digestion of their mysteries. Mollie Weston, with her " midnight eyes," and intellec- tual mein, well set on a physiognomy of beauty, had not failed to lead the hitherto stoical practitioner, captive in her retinue of admirers. Of this she was wholly uncon- scious, attributing his visits, to the honor of Annie Ba- con's memory, more than to her own credit. True, she had always welcomed him secretly, and even felt delighted whenever he crossed her father's threshold, but as she thought these attentions were' not due her, she set her- self to work in schooling her heart to render it impervi- ous to any fancied impressions. Was she wrong in this? Is it right to suffer our affections to run at large,uunless we know the bounds thereof are not characterized by any hidden sting? And had not Prudence better take her stand in time, than to wait until the danger is too great for her strength? Nor can we say that Molhe was acquainted with her own heart, for ere the passing fall had dismantled the forest of its rich foliage, she had learned to regard him as a mere friend. And why? .Be- cause she imagined that there was a gulf be tween them, as wide as the one between the rich and the poor man, and then, what assurance had she that he regarded her more than any other? He had worshipped her at a distance, and the warm outgushings of his heart, were screened by calm formality. But this is a digression. According- to arrangement, Monday  evening after early tea, one by one of the investigators dropped in at Mr. Weston's house, each wearing an anxious look, for the question to be discussed was one of vital importance,- and a desideratum of all parties.  &#xD;<pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC8270-00000224"/>  ,442     LB E-ANT3)DBR HALL. Mr. Sumner was still absent. Instead of commingling with-his friends,he kept himself at home, delving in the intricacies of expositions given in favor of his cause, but when he began to weigh argumenlt, the scales, in spite of all great men's commentations, would not balance on his side. He was studying for his cause, but his foundation of faith in it was becoming more and more insecure. He learned this, much to his discomfiture, for he was a con* scientious man, and did not like to propagate doctrine which he believed to be false. But he had begun the work, so he resolved to prosecute to perseverance, whether of favor or ill-favor. Preacher Sampson began to clear his throat as sooh as all were settled, significant of having some incontroverti- ble argument in store, fresh from the great Bethany or- gan. However, we will not anticipate. He selected a very imposing position, and taking up his favorite paper, in sonorous tones, began: "I presume, sirs, we will discuss the subject termed: 'Influence of the Holy Spirit,' a more interesting study could not be found." "T'hat's the next point I believe," replied Mr. Weston, drawing nearer the table on which many theological works were lying. Dr. Boon had taken his seat under the shade of a lamp, in order that the anxiety of his ever changing coulte- nance might not be noticed. Mrs. Weston, though a very retired and secluded lady, had come in to be a listener, on this noted occasion. Mr. Weston's family with the two new accessions from the Reformation, together with P-eacher Sampson, Dr. Boon and the members of the Wesleyan Society, composed the company under observation. Though small, there was a feeling of intensity manifested by all the non- combatants, and even Mr. Sampson and Mr. Weston seemed unusually interested. "Before we begin," said Mr. Weston, "let us decide on the meaning of regeneration, of conversion and of sancti- filation or purification." "Well, what's the difference between them any way?" asked Mr. Sampson. "We will decide the differences thus: Regeneration means born again, or quickened from the 'dead state of   THE INVESTIGATION.         448 the sinner. It is never considered as a generic term. No one is regenerated in any sense, but the one just mention- ed. You will admit this Mr. Sampson?" "Yes sir, I will acknowledge that regeneration has no synonym but guickening or born again." "But conversion you will concede, is considered as a generic term; and in a christian sense, is the merely con- sequent on regeneration?" "Yes sir; many may be converted from one religion to another, and neVer be regenerated. Then,'if it is consider- ed a generic term, conversion cannot be considered as regeneration." "Very well, Mr. Sampson. Since conversion is a gen- eric term, and evangelical conversion merely consequent on regeneration; and since it cannot be regeneration, what then is it? Let us see. The sinner is regenerated, or rather first, the Word is preached to him. God opens his heart to understand it-he removes spiritual blindness, or it (the Word) would be like seed sown in stony places. This change of heart is regeneration. He believes the Word, after regeneration. This evangelical belief is con- version to Christianity, and it cannot take place until the callous and dead heart is softened, or quickened, for mo- tives never were of sufficient power to cause man to be- lieve, as long as the heart is enmity against God. If man is depraved, and his heart enmity against God, (and we cannot doubt it,) and if motives cannot induce belief, or love to God, then something stronger must operate on that vilemature, or man would ever remain in condemna- tion, because he is wicked and deceitful, and God is pure. Hence in their respective states, the former cannot love the latter, because of his antagonistic feelings. The Holy Spirit only, can change that vile heart, and externals are as powerless as motives, in this affection. Therefore, the Word cannot regenerate, nor can it evangelically convert, until regeneration takes place first. Many have heard the Word, and have given their assent to its teachings. These were converted, in one sense, but no one is evangelically converted, until regenerated by the Holy Spirit. "We have decided the above, now what is sanctifica- tion- 'It cannot be considered regeneration, neither can it be termed conversion, but rather a constituent of both. let.

Regeneration and belief, together with obe- dience, are constituents of sanctification. Hence the saying of our Saviour, 'Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.' "Before you, Mr. Sampson, is a succinct compendium of my views, and to which I will confine myself throughout the discussion of this point. I affirm that regeneration is a quickening; conversion, a change from unbelief, to belief; and sanctification, a component of regeneration, belief, and obedience. Will you now lay down the path in which you will travel?" "Certainly, certainly, Mr. Weston, with pleasure. To put before the company the ultimatum of my vieWs, al- low me to read a brief synopsis from one of the great founders of our system-Bro. Alexander Campbell, for-. merly President of Bethany College, and the able editor of the Millennial Harbinger: "' AS the spirit of manw;puts forth all its moral power in words which it fillswith its ideas; so the Spirit of God puts forth all its converting and sanctifying power, in the words which it fills with its ideas. Miracles cannot convert. They can only obtain a favorable hearing of the converting argu- ments. If they fail to obtain a favorable hearing, the argu- ments which they prove are impotent as an unnlown tongue. If the Spirit of God has spoken all its arguments; or, if the New and Old Testament contain all the arguments which can be offered to reconcile manz to God, and to purify them that are reconciled; then all the power of the Holy Spirit which can operate upon the human mind, is spent; and he that is not sanctified and saved by these, cannot be saved by angels or spirits, human or divine.' "I need not say that I endorse this extract, read from one of our most popular organs, for you all know that the above is aln epitome of our doctrine. It is my opin- ion, no language known, could express more than the few words which I've just read, and further, no other man known, could have expressed these ideas in a clearer or more explicit style than the author just quoted. He was a man who read the Bible, and who made the Bible only, his guide. He renounced all creeds of human devices, at the risk of popularity and assailments from all sources,   THE INVBSTIGATION.       445 and followed undeviatingly the teaching of the word of God." Mr. Sampson. paused a moment and looked around to see what effect his words were having on his hearers, but blank countenances only, met his glances. He proceeded: "It behooves me to offer something in proof of this great fundamental proposition. I will draw an argu- ment: "st. From the constitution of the human mind. Reli- gion imparts no new faculties, but imparts new impressions, only. Faith 'comes by hearing.' The intellectual and moral arrangement is-1; The word spoken; 2, hearing; 3, believing; 4, feeling; 5, doing. Such is the constitu- tion of the human mind-a constitution divine and ex- cellently adapted to man's position in the universe. It is never violated in the moral government of God. Reli- gious action is uniformly the effect of. religious feeling: that is, the effect of faith; that of hearing; and that of something spoken by God." So spoke the champion of Campbellism; which was but a reiteration of one of its fundamental principles. "That doctrine is plausible enough indeed;" remarked Dr. Boon, "were it not for the total depravity of the human heart." "That is indeed a serious objection to such a theory," said Mr. Weston. "And, it is one that cannot be over- come, for the mind unregenerated cannot receive 'new impressions-' of the Christian religion, were the whole Word spoken, accompanied by most eloquent appeals of the oratorical powers of man. Paul, prior to his conver- sion, had heard the Word time and again, and according to your theory, all the power of the Holy Spirit that could operate on the human mind, had been ' SPENT, and Paul would have, been left beyond the reach of mercy, but that was not the case: he heard the Word delivered by its most eloquent expounders, but the Spirit did not accompany it to his soul, and disinclination the conse- quence of human depravity, caused him to turn away from such purity, therefore, he rejected it, and even continued to persecute it until God saw proper to call him away from such intentions, so by his Spirit he riveted convie- tion of the Word's import in his heart, which caused the poor penitent to cry: 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to  &#xD;<pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC8270-00000226"/> "6       L EANDER HAfLL. do?  If all the Spirit's power is in the Word, why does the Word ever fail to have effect? why did it fail to have an effect on Paul prior to his conversion? But this Is not the case. God operates when and where he chooses with, or without his Word, being spoken or read, and this he does by the Spirit; he does not confine his power to the preaching, or hearing of the Word for many hear it, but perceive it not, because the separate influence of the Spirit does not operate. God is omnipotent, the Whole human mind is in his perfect control, he asks no instru- ments any odds, only as he chooses them for his purpo- ses. And such is our depravity, that unless he quickens us by his Spirit, the Word to us would be no more than to the Jews, who Christ said, could see, but perceive not, and hear, but understand not, because it was not given unto them 'to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven '-the Spirit of God had not revealed what ' flesh and blood' could not do. The Word was spoken, and heard, but un- derstood not, it was an external object of motive pre- sented, but it had no effect in regeneration, and so it is in our day. Many hear it,- many give their assent to it but few understand it, or perceive it spirituality. Like Nicodemus. they have not been 'born from above' there- fore the spirituality of the kingdom is to them, incom- prehensible." Mr. Sampson felt the truth of the argument, but as he had (as he thought) in store a formidable array of incon- testible proofs of his grounds, he was not much discon- certed.  "But," continued Mr. Weston, "I am under no obliga- tion to combat with metaphysics-the composition of your point drawn in support of the heading proposition. In investigating this subject, we must take the Bible as our guide and not philosophical calculations. You attempted to draw an argument from the constitution of the human mind, and yet you cannot deny but man 'is a depraved being, if depraved he is wholly incapable of comprehend- ing spiritually the Word of God, if not assisted by some supernatural agehcy, which is not in the power of the Word to exert. There is no help for your propositionto be drawn from the 'constitution of the human mind,' for 'the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?' Again: 'There are none righte-   THE  -NVESTIGATION.       47  ous, no, not one; there are none that understandeth, there are none that seeketl after thee profitably; there are none that doeth good, no, not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of the asp is under their lips; whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace, have they not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes.' Thus the human heart is represented, and this is the constitution of the human mind, yet you would have it holy and upright enough for heaven without the power of God' who hath quickened us together with Christ.' The human heart, as represen- ted by the Bible, is not a subject capable of receiving the things of heaven without a radical change. Paul says the 'natural man' cannot receive these things; it was not given to those who walk after the flesh,-who, as Simon the sorcerer, are yet in 'the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.' But I am taking up too much  time over this matter. Proceed Mr. Sampson." The preacher obeyed. We draw another argument in favor of our proposi- tion, from the fact, "2nd. That the Holy Spirit has never been known to operate on any living man, only through the Word. God has ever chosen the Word, and its effects only, to re- generate men.  There is nothing  distinct from it. Wherever it goes the Spirit accompanies it, like my spirit which accompanies me. The Spirit and the Word are inseparable, and the Spirit is only the effect of the Word and arguments; when these fails, the Spirit fails. Or, 'If the Spirit of God has spoken all its argumnents; or, if the New and old Testament contain all the arguments which can be offered to reconcile man to God, and to purify them who are reconciled, then all the power (f the Holy Spirit which can operate upon the human mind is spent; and he that is not sanctified and saved by these cannot be saved by angels or spirits, human or divine."' "You contend, if I understand you aright, Mr. Samp- son, that when arguments fail to convert, the Spirit is SPENT?" "Yes sir, and thereis no other power given to save man!"  &#xD;<pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC8270-00000227"/> "8       LEANDER HALL. "Then you have the conversion of a man depending on arguments." "Yes sir, and the arguments necessary are in the Word. As Paul says: 'We speak spiritual things in spiritual words, or words which the spirit teacheth, ex- pressing spiritual things in spiritual words.'" "(If Paul does say that, how does that help you? He does not signify that regeneration is in the Word, he says or means that they spoke what the Spirit-suggested to THEM, and not to the hearers. We are not contending for the influence of the Spirit on the speaker, but on the hearer! Can we doubt that the martyred Stephen was speaking by inspiration when he yielded up the ghost? Paul was present then, and heard his exhortation-his ,spiritualwords,' and yet was not converted; why was this? Because, though the apostle was ' expressing spir- itual things in spiritual words,' the Spirit was not opera- ting on his (Paul's,) heart, consequently he suffered the persecutors of Stephen to lay their clothes at his feet for protection, at the same time, 'copsenting unto his death.' Yet afterwards, when Christ chose to open his heart, he yielded to the Word though not until some separate influ- ence or power, called his attention to it." Preacher Sanmpson began to lose his composure, he was not exactly prepared for such a reply. He felt and knew that Mr. Weston was correct, but fate had placed him where it was impossible for him to acknowledge his error without incurring unnumbered frowns and sneers from the world. This he was not prepared for. A silence ensued, painful to him, indeed. He must speak, but what ito say he knew not. This argument, like his ideas of the Holy Spirit, had been "spent, " and he was left to twist literally and figuratively out of this difficulty. "If you contend sir, that God ever operates onlman in any other way than through words and ideas, just give me one instance of such a miracle. I say the Word is an indispensable instrument"'- "-So do I, to the conversion of the soul, but being an instrument, is not the efficient cause. The' Spirit is that efficient, and the Word is the instrument that converts the sinner from his course, but the Word is not the in- strument that rivets conviction. The christian's duty   JF a JU AL aIX V JB a -' U n ^ ' J V JH * Do X lies in the Word, and nothing more. He is told to re- pent and believe, but he hears it not until the Spirit moves his heart. God has given his Word to convey the ideas of the Spirit by the speaker, and he has also given the Spirit to give understanding to the hearer of the Word, or the Word can have no effect. To say that the Spirit is in the Word to the hearer, would be to convey the sentiment that every one who hears the Word must necessa- rily be regenerated and converted! But this is not so, for many hear the Word proclaimed in most eloquent strains, and yet remain unmoved by it. The Spirit is a separate influence from the Word and operates where the Word has been spoken, but the Spirit is wholly independent of the Word. God works whenever he sees proper." "But tell me where God has ever operated on man, only through arguments? He presented words to -the Kipg of Egypt, and in every instance throughout the lids of tfiis book, (the Bible,) to influence man to act as he desired." "You are too fast, sir. Allow me to call to remem- brance, Sihon, king of Heshbon. Itis said that God 'hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate' so that he would not suffer the Children of Israel to pass. Was that done by words and arguments? And there are other instances where God operated on the human mind, without words and arguments. To say that God uses no influence only through the Word, or what is in the Word, would be to infringe the scope of his omnipotence. God has never qonfined himself to means and instrumentali- ties. In ordinary cases, he has clothed and fed the peo-  ple by means, but when his people were journeying through the wilderness, he used miracles to supply them with food and raiment. He also quenched their natu- ral thirsts, with water miraculously brought from out of a rock. So he works through his Spirit. "No sinner truly regenerated, will ever say that it was done by words and arguments. Ask the convert, and he will tell you that he groped in midnight darkness, vainly endeavoring to receive the things of the Spirit, and to understand the Word,-that God furnished instruments, who told him how to repent, how to believe, and how to rely on Jesus; but he could not obey, until some mirac- ulous influence made him, and then the hitherto mysteri- bus teachings of the Word, were made plain.-he could 38   &#xD;<pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC8270-00000228"/> 4fo.      LEAJSNDBEB HALL. understand them-he could receive them-and they con- verted him from his ways of sin, to the ways of God-to the belief in, and obedience of his laws; but prior to this, his heart of stone was removed, and he was justified by the acknowledgement, that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, which assured revelation, he knows and will testify, was not made by flesh and blood, but by the Father in heaven. And thus, God is omnipotent, om- nipresent, and omniscient. To prescribe for the extent of his power, is impossible. He-suffered the Word to be used without effect, and he uses it with effect, but that effect results from the Spirit's power. Paul may plant, : and Apollos water, but it is God that gives the in- crease. Or, as Paul says: 'I have planted, Apollos wa- tered: but God gave the increase.' If God could create man at first, holy, without words or arguments, then he can do it again," concluded Mr. Weston. ".That theory does away, then, with the necessity of preaching the Word at all. Where is the use of preach- ing if such be true?" asked Mr. Sampson, summoning the highest pitch of his courage. "I might-ask you sir, with the same propriety, what was the'use of blowing the ram's horns around the walls of Jer- ico? The sound of the trumpet did not cause the walls to totter and fall to the ground. It wasGod's power alone; but he selected that as a conditional instrument. In this sense, he chooses the Word, as giving the promise to its propagators, and it only serves the office of a seeming instrument of regeneration, and the real of conversion. He1 has commanded us to preach the Gospel, and has promised effect, and he has also fulfilled his precious promise. We are his instruments, in this sense of cho- sen power, and nothing more. If it were his will, he could turn every heart in Christendom to praise him, in the twinkling of an eye, without the Word either spo- ken or read, but it is his will that we should preach, and his Spirit shall open'hearts to hear the Word. 'He work- eth in us to will and to do, of his good pleasure."' The lay members of the Reformation began to get very uneasy before Mr. Weston finished, for they knew and felt the force of such argument. It so happened that one of the brethren present had been a Baptist, and had joined the Campbellites because he did not hold with   I         T ; 1THB i;NV!Str-Afti0.    451 close eommunion, but now, as matters developed them- selves, he began to see more frightful features in the Church he was in, than the one he had left.' We wonder if there are not many others in the like position? When the Current Reformation swept over this State like a flooding tide, many, very many yielded to its persuasive waves, who now repent their folly. Many Baptists suc- cumbed to the popular doctrine, who now, if it were not for consequent stigmas, would retrace, as we believe. their erring steps, like the Prodigal Son. But this is an unnecessary digression. Perhaps our friend Mfr. Sampson has other argument, so let us return. An " ahem " and a slight yawning were the only visi- ble signs of his animation, when Mr. Weston asked him to proceed. A moment elapsed, and he glanced at his home-made concordance to   refresh his treacherous memory. ' Sir, I wish to hold before you - my distinct position," he said after a slight pause between the time. "I will read," he continued, "the heading proposition agaip, so that there may be no misunderstanding about it." : (Mr. Sampson was getting out of ideas it seems, when he was driven to the second reiteration of his funda- mental principles.) "'As the spirit of man puts forth all its moral power, in the words which it fills with its ideas; so the Spirit of God pats forth all its converting and sanctifying' power in the words which it fills with its ideas. Miracles cannot convert. They can only obtain a favorable hearing of the converting arguments. If they fail to obtain a favorable hearinq, the arguments which they prove, are important as an unknown tongue. If the Spirit of God has spoken all its arguments: or if the New and Old Testament contain all the arguments which can be offered to reconcile man to God, and to purify them who are reconciled; then all the power of the Holy Spirit which can operate urpon the human mind is spent; and he that is not sanctified and saved by these, cannot be saved by angels, or Spirits, human or divine.'

If men are not converted by arguments, they cannot be, at all." "I understand you to place all the power of the Holy Spirit in words." "That is what I mean." "If I thought it," replied Mr. Weston, "I would never preach another sermon, for I do not possess melting elo- quence, or touchingspathos, sufficient to convert any sin- ner living, therefore my preaching would be useless. I could never present the Word in such colors as to arrest the sinner's attention, as I am slow of speech, like Moses. But sir, I cannot think this. I do not rely on my powers of eloquence in the presentation of the Word of God,- but I do rely on the power and promises of God; for it is Him that gives the increase. When my arguments, drawn from the Word, fail to convince, (which of their own power, will always be the case,) I trust to the grace of God'to do what I cannot do. I am commanded to teach with thepromise of success, but the success lies not in the merit of my teachings but in the power of God, who hath quickened us in Jesus Christ. The difference between us, is, you contend that you can regenerate and convert the world by the eloquence of the Word, written, read, or heard; and I, that though I possessed the wisdom of Solomon, and the eloquence of Paul, I could not convert one sinner to God, without the immediate aid of the Holy Spirit to quicken the spiritually ' dead' sinner-to regenerate him, and remove his mental blindness, in or- der that he may understand the Word, which teaches repentance, faith, and obedience. Sir, in this difference, lies the error of your Church. You make men believe that all they have to do is to believe the Word and be baptized for the remission of sins. Where is the individ- ual in this town, or State, (except the infidel,) who does not believe that Jesus is the Christ, and that lhe died for our sins? Men as a mass give their consent to this, but they have not the faith which takes hold of God as their salvation. Simon believed, but not with this faith. King Herod believed that Jesus was the Messiah, but his be- lief was not the savingfaith. Nicodemus acknowledged, virtually, that Jesus was the Christ, but he had not been   THE INVESTIGATION.        453 born to this saving faith, consequently marveled at it! And as it is with all who have not beenI made ' dead' to sin, and 'alive' to righteousness. You tell them to rely on baptism, and they do it, and I believe that many, yes, many poor deluded souls have been hurled into eternity, with the impression that their sins have been remitted, since they gave their assent to the Word, and were bap- tized! Sir, such faith is not the 'gift of God,' or the conversion that is consequent on regeneration, but it is a thing in common, and believe me, he who relies on the merit of such works for salvation, will be lost. We have seen many of that character die, and we have shuddered, for the mark of unwillingness was stamped on their brow, though with their lips they consoled their bereaved friends with the saying that they were willing to go. And from what sprang that willingness? One said be- cause he had obeyed Christ in baptism; another, because he had tried to walk worthy of the vocation whereby he was called, but sad to say, I heard none say that they hoped for their salvation, through the merit of dur Sa- viour. The Roman Catholic, the Universalist, the In- fidel, and the Mahommedan die with faith and reliance on other sources. of salvation than the right one, and so, I fear, that it is the way with the one who trusts to sal- vation in the water. It is universally the case, that unre- generated men will fly to any other source of salvation than to our Saviour.- It is hard for them to give up their ideas of self-merit, and trust in God only." Mr. Sampson knew that Mr. Weston was speaking the truth, unvarnished, therefore he attempted no reply to his assertions. Dr. Boon, drew his chair a little closer to the table, around which the disputants had gathered. The bright rays of the lamp fell directly on his countenance, reveal- ing a look of deepest anxiety. He had ceased to espouse their cause, and his faith in his baptism, was with the things that were. But he was none the less interested in the investigation however, for he was anxious to know how his friend would extricate himself. Things assumed an aspect of intensity, and each phys- iognomy present, manifested an unusual degree of anxie- ty in the proceedings. The members of the Reformation, began to think that  &#xD;<pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC8270-00000230"/> the tide was fast falling, leaving their barque unmoved from the snag, that it had run a foul of, in its nnman- ageable1iess          , Severalt imploring looks at Mr. Sampson from his brethren, warned him of their danger, so he felt a move must be made, or all would be lost! Another reference to his concordance, and he proceeded, with the following effort, wrung fro:n him by the com- pulsion of-the moment. "3d. Tihe Word of God is sufficient to sanctify and save us., Orr- Saviour prayed: 'Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.' If there were no other evidences in the Bible of this proposition, the passage cited, would establish it. Remember now, will you, that we are sanc- tified by the Word! What could be more explicit?" "( Well, really, Mr. Sampson, you could not have found a passage in the whole Bible, more conclusive of the doc- trine that I am advocating, than the one just cited. Does not the Saviour pray to his Father, to sanctify them? If your doctrine be true, why should he have prayed? He did not pray that new truths, new arguments should be revealed to his people, but he prayed for a special power from the Father. According to your doctrine, it was necessary only, that the Word be given. But our Saviour prayed to his Father to do something for them, and to do it by certain means-to exert on the mind an influence distinct from the power of the Word, but in connection with its teachings. It is plain that the Word could not do what was necessary, so our Saviour prayed for somle other power. The Father must do this by the Spirit through the Word. The former regenerates, or qieckens, while the latter converts, and sanctificaton is the constituent of both-that is, it embraces both regeneration and con- version, and neither of the latter taken separately can be considered synonymous with sanctification. Strange, Mr., Sampson, that you selected that passage to prove that words and arguments contain sufficient power to regene- rate, for in it, God is called on to do the special work, and not the Word; or rather the Word and its effects, are not depended on." "Granting you that passage, Mr. Weston," he replied,  for the sake of argument, there are others that are in- fallible, which I cn produce in favor of my proposition,   L Peter, 1: 23; 'Being born, not of corruptible seed, but i of incorruptible seed, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. Here the Word is represented as a seed, living and abiding forever. Our Lord also repre-  sents the Word as a seed sown, springing up to eternal life. A double metaphor is made use of-drawn from the animal and vegetable kingdoms. "Allow me to amplify: With regard to the essentiality of the seed, we all know in harvest, no fruit is yielded without the seed being previously sown, and that the har- vest is the product of the seed. So, conversion is  - the product of the Word. Sir, to my honest conviction, this passage settles the question forever. We are so plain- ly told that we are 'born by the Word,'-that the Word contains all the converting power, or to use Bro. Camp- bell's language: ' We plead, that all the converting power of the Holy Spirit is exhibited in the divine record.' Christiani- ty Restored-pp. 851."  Dr. Boon bent his head closer to hear the reply. The Brother Campbellites present, predicted that no answer could be made. Mr. Sampson looked confident, and we are assured, felt perfectly easy, for he imagined: that he had erected an impregnable strong-hold, behind which, he might repose, notwithstanding the booming artillery of his antagonist. Was he, right? We will see. "That text," said Mr. Weston, "seemingly, might be constrlued in your favor, but I don't so understand it. I think you have made some broad assertions, which you will find difficult to authenticate. You have compared the Word of God to seed sown, producing harvest. Very good. Now, I would ask you, if the seed ;of its own power could bring forth fruit?"  "Certainly not, sir. Other agencies are requisite. But there could be no harvest without the seed." "We will leave that with God. If he is omnipotent, nothing is impossible. We sow the seed, but God must give the increase-he must cause the refreshing rains and other equally important agencies, or the seed would rot in the earth, unfructified.' Just ot with the Word. We may preach it with all power of eloquence, and all its arguments combined, in which you say consist its only converting powers-we may preach, exhort, pray, and obey every other commandment given in connection, but  &#xD;<pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC8270-00000231"/> 456       LEANDER  HALL-. God must give the increase. God must send the anima: ting showers of the' Holy Spirit, separate and distinct, and in addition; to our efforts, or the Word, like the seed, would parch and burn up,r notwithstanding the argument and eloquence with which it Was sown. Sir, you can cause a seed of your own power and will, to spring up and fructify, without any agency of divine in- terposition, as easily as you can convert a sinner with all human eloquence combined, without special and divine influence of the Holy Spirit. "If you will read the preceding verse of the text cited, I think you will have a clearer elucidation of the subject, than I can give. You have,the book, Mr. Sampson, just turn to it and read." Mr. Sampson obeyed. "'Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeyingthe truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.'" Mr. Sampson did not like the sound of that passage, so he remained silent. Mr. Weston continued. "How plainly it i. shown that obedience must come through the Spirit! that Without the distinct influence of the Spirit, the truth would not be heard or obeyed! And yet iou contend that all the converting power of the Spiri is in the Word, but we are told that we obey the Word through the Spirit, not the Spirit through the Word. If all the converting power of the Spirit, were in words and arguments, we would not obey the truth through the Spirit, but we would obey it through the Word!-we would obey the- Word through the Word!!" In compassion for Mr. Sampson and his brethren, Dr. Boon moved for a suspension of the discussion, until the next evening. It was also getting quite late, therefore the move was in order.  - Mr. Sampson attempted no defense, for he knew of no help. Muttering incoherent sentences, he arose and took 'his hat, and left, wishing much that he had never heard of that " tight laced." Baptist preacher. No wonder.- Some of the attendants of the discussion began to think by the time, that close-communion was not the greatest dogma after all, known in the Churches.

OVER two long months had elapsed since Annie Bacon left her home. Two months crowded with sorrow and trial, fruitful of most dreaded forebodings.  Two months which had laved themselves in the luxury of time's most gluttinous ravages, stealing her hope and leaving her almost a wreck of despair! Would that the curtains could be lowered, closing the scene of sorrow from our view, for the pen glides along these lines with reluctance, as such events are traced and recorded. Would that our heroine's life could be one 89  &#xD;<pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC8270-00000232"/> -458      LEANDER HALL. continual scene of joy and happiness, then would our chronicler borrow a glow therefrom, which would, per- haps, give life to thoughts, that otherwise must remain unresurrected. Would that the shade, contiguous to the reflections of such companions, could be overcast with sunshine, so that in noting after-events, the haunting spirit of chillling sensations, would not arise, to tincture the present essaying, with tints of sorrow, painted by the eternal Past. But such is nature, that, write in what strain you will, the ghosts of by-gones will rise up to darken the present visions. The tall oaks at Milton College still bore Annie Ba- con shelter, from the sky-light of heaven's smiles; and through their lapping boughs, the cool autumnal winds, still whistled their mournful notes, as ominous as the croaking of the raven, that ever portends additional gloom. We find her here again, one month from the time we left her, when in the receipt of Mollie Weston's letter. It had, indeed, been a bitter period to her, as the reader must conclude, when recollecting the contents of thatletter. Several days had elapsed before she could find courage to make the requested reply, in answer to which, she was again in receipt of another epistle. She had now resorted thither to write the second time to Mol- lie Weston. Seating herself on the roots of a tree, and using the back of an atlas for a writing desk, one moment she sat in study, and then the following lines were dashed off hastily: "DEAREST MOLLIE:-Once more I am seated to con- verse with you a few moments, through'the medium of writing. I hardly know what to say, though thus bless- ed. Time, wih me, has been very tedious, yet almost wholly occupied. My avocation is not of the most pleas- ing nature, though I am thankful to find employment that affords sustenance. Often wearied at night, with the day's task, I throw myself on my couch to rest, but such a turmoil of by-gones rush to my memory, that it is impossible, sometimes, to gain repose until the late hours of night. a"Dear Mollie, I am not looking as well as I did when I left home, (poor thing, she forgot the haggard look she -,'   THE INVESTIGATiON.       459 wore at that period,) but my employment is such, that I do not take much exercise, and I cannot think that con- finement agrees with me. My duties are very laborious; so different from what I have been used to, that I certain- ly would succumb to overtasked energies, were it not that I feel I am striving in a good cause. I cannot think that I am thus taxed and suppoited without some divine agency. Yes, much is attributable to the interposition of the Lord of the Sabbath; this I feel, and this I know. Often my situation leads me to remember the martyred Faith of Acquitain, who, being informed that Dacian, the Roman Governor of Gaul, designed apprehending her surrendered herself to his authorities and was sentenced to be put to death, which judgement was executed, in a most cruel manner! She was a Christian, and she was a Bap- tist?--one who contended against the innovation of the then rising Pope! and it was for this that she suffered martyrdom! But she was not alone, for we read of a long train of female martyrs from her, even to our pres- ent century. If they could endure so much, I pray for strength to bear my affliction, which is light in compari- "Your letter to me, was of a dark and ominous import. While I had resolved to give up all hope of Mr. Sumner, I had not prepared myself to hear of his affiance with another. Oh! what a struggle that intelligence has caus- ed me. Who can imagine my anguish? -It was the bit- terest cup that I have been compelled to quaff. But, Mol- lie, it is all over with me uow. I am resigned, thinking that if his love could not bear the test, it was unworthy of my consideration.  "You make only casual remarks about Dr. Boon. Why so? Does he visit you? I know he feels more than ordinary interest in you, for he told me as much long ago. I trust that interest in the future, may be more fully de- veloped, and reciprocated, for he is an esteemed friend of mine, and nothing could give me, more pleasure than to hear of suich an event. "And now Mollie, there is one more to mention; one dreaded, and one that I hardly dare breathe-my father! I know he is lonely and in trouble, but the panacea lies in his power alone, therefore he is beyond my help. Oh! if he would "but retract those direful words which drove ^  &#xD;<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC8270-00000233"/> 48^      tLfANTDBER HALL. fe fr om my home I would fly to his embrace, aind de- vote my life to his interest and my Redeemer's cause. But, Mollie, as it is, infringements must be made on my religious sentiment, if I attempt such a thing, so I would rather suffer execution along with my Piedmont friends. I trust and pray for a brighter and better day to dawn on me, yet but little room for such a hope is discernable. I have much to endure, 'but I have a blessed consolation, and that, it is a weak unmeritorious remuneration to him who sacrificed all, all for me! Oh when the blood- watered Alpine valleys, with their spectral memory, rise up before me, what is my cross to its hunted, persecuted refugees? Still more, when Calvary's heights loom up, capped with Christ's blood, and the bleeding Saviour, groaning with the weight of the sins of a world pressing the steel in his flesh, what is my cross, but a shadow, to the one borne there-and borne-for me! To-day finds me, dear Mollie, ready to endure all tribulation, all trial which fate may choose to heap on my head, by the strength of Him who hath said: 'My grace is sufficient for thee.' Pray for     Your Friend, "ANNIE." When she closed, a radient smile bathed her counte- nance, saturated with tears, accompanied with resigna- tion!-a jewel of priceless value to the heart, bereft of earthly hope! The tall oaks began to interlace their distended boughs, from the motion of the cool wind. A chill crept over Annie's frame, for her wrapping had fallen from her shoulders, and her bonnet was pushed back, so that but little screen was made against the unpleasant combatant. It was time for her to return to the house, for the sun had long since departed, taking the little warmth of his rays to shed a genial smile on some benighted clime. The horned moon was moving westward in pursuit, as if to steal some warmer light from her solsticial source, or to keep in closer proximity with the body which seemingly had been turned askance to despoil the earth of its heat. Annie gathered up her scattered vaccoutrements and repaired to her lonely sanctuary, to keep company with her usual melancholy associates-reflections on the past, whose pleasure was to devour hopes of the uncertain and obscured future.   !           TTE IN-VX STIf  ATIO1N.    -41 The "t6wn talk" of M-- now, was Mr. Sumner. Conference was in near approach, and his Churches had begun an underground conspiracy for his downfall. Every conceivable report of misdemeanor liad been thoroug!hly circulated and well digested. He had ceased to fill the "sacred desk " on Sabbaths, as was his wont a few weeks previously. Some attributed it to one cause, and some to another. "It is just as I said Sister Crow!" exclaimed Miss Lan- i  -  kinston, as she adjusted her bonnet with the itntetion of leaving. "And I too!" quickly rejoined the other, not wishing any one to be before her in prediction. "It's a shame he did not come out to preaching last Sabbath. It will make the matter go harder with him. I do not know what he cal be thinking of." "Oh it's this, Miss Matilda, lie feels guilty, and don't like to show himself. But are you certain that he ia in town?" "Well I don't exactly know; if he aint he ought to be." "Perhaps he is sick." "No, no; if he were, we would have heard something about it. Here comes Sister Moore, may be she can tell us something about it." ' Well sit down Miss Matilda. You appear to be in a great hurry any way, this morning. There, empty that chair for Sister Moore, and open the door, so that we may have air in here. Betsy! iring in some fresh water, quick! Good morning Sister Moore. Come in. Glad to see you. Sit down. How is your health?"And she rattled away, not giving her visitor a chance to make a reply to the inquiries made. "We were talking about the strange manner in which  Bro. Sumner has been acting here lately, can you account for it?" asked Miss Lankinston, as soon as the Inew arri- val was seated. "I don't know exactly. He left M-- last week for his Sister's, with the plea of ill-health, but I heard one of the brethren say that the Church did not choose to recognize his plea, as tiey attributed it to something else besides ill-health."' "And that was the reason of no apology being offered for his "adence."  &#xD;<pb n="462-463" xml:id="VAC8270-00000234"/> "EANDER HALL. ' "Yes; Bro. Wilson said that he did not feel like get- ting np and telling something that- he did not believe, so they (the brethren,) colcluded to remain silent." "'A very wise plan, by-the-way, for we all wonld have tholughtat once the real cause. Well, Conference will meet next wAeek; I reckon he swill recover sufficiently to  be present then, or he will be excluded without much trial, as circumstantial evidence is pretty strong." "So I suppose. He did lno go out to Pea Ridge the last third Sabbath. The brethren concluded from some strong hints they had received, that something was wrong, and I am told, fitted up an affidavit against him, prepar- atory for Conference." "Ah. indeed?" "Yes; and there are some whisperings afloat in M--- about our Church doing the same. Now you must keep silent on this subject, for I do not want to be implicated mIthis matter, by any means." "Trust to me for that." "And to me too, for I will be the last to say any thing about it." "So you both must keep still. Some say that he left town to keep from preaching between now and Mr. Weston's next meeting here." "- So I believe. Little does he think before that meet- ing comes off, he will have been excluded from our Church!" rejoiced Miss Lankinston, in contemplation of suchLan event. And little did he think it, sure enough, for Mr. Sum- ner was wholly unconscious of what was going on so secretly against him. As to joining the Baptist Church, nothing was more distant from his mind. True, ihe felt it to be the only orthodox Church in existence, for a thor- ough examination into the subject in which he had been engaged, had imparted new ideas-of its creeds, but the thought of uniting with it was quite distant. To tell the truth, Mr. Sumner shrank. from the clamor which he kndw would be raised, should he do such a thing. And then he was satisfied (so he thought,) where he was, all to one thing, and that was, Annie Bacon was not with him in Church fellowship and avowed religious sentiment. When Mr. Sumner contemplated his situation as to temporals, he always felt much inclined to thankfulness, for he was certainly " well-to-do" in the world.   THE INVESTIGATION.        468 Tired, worn out, both in body and mind, his strength gave way, and with it his health, the second time since summer. Nothing offered itself more plausibly, than another trip to see his sister, there, free from study, to 4   recruit, in order to be able to attend Conference. Ac- cordingly, he wound up his business to the best of his ability, (for he was an itinerant, and knew not whether he would be sent back on that circuit or not,) and sent long apologies to his Churches, with farewell exhortations which we have already sed6, how received, (a part at least.) In his calculations, our hero was disappointed, for the second day after his arrival at the old homestead, he was /prostrated by a severe attack of malignant fever, which was protracted several months. There we will leave him to the watchful care of his widowed sister, and com- mending him into the hands of Him who tempers the woilds to the shorn lambs-who watches the fall of the little sparrows, even more, his children. Mr. Sampson had again been recreant to his pledge. Busines was so pressing that he could not possibly en- gage in the discussion for several days to come, though  we remember of having seen him several times " busy" over one of Madame Southworth's latest novels, even during the day time. "Several days" were kept ahead until several weeks had passed. Dr. Boon grew restless. He was anxious for the finale, let it be what it might. Early one morning, before time to make professional calls, he sought the third or fourth interview with his pastor, to urge on him the importance of immediate con- tinuatiou of the investigation. i/  "I am so desirous of hearing the conclusion," said he, after introducing the subject. "Tut, tut, Doctor, you act like some child. Weston has done all he can do for his cause, if that's what you want to know," impatiently responded Mr. Sampson, while endeavoring to open a snuff-box, which obstinately resisted his attempts. "And now, Bro. Sampson, I want you to do something for our cause," coolly interrupted Dr. Boon. "As though I have not!" he exclaimed in a displeased tone. "I do not doubt," replied Dr. Boon, apologetically, ['J VUI vrr  &#xD;<pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC8270-00000235"/> "4-     I, BANDER HALL. -but you have intrbduced some very conclusive argu- mejit, yet Mr. Weston seems to have refuted it all. Now I hope you have much more in the future, though I can not believe in your theory. I had rather be convinced that we are right in this thing, but I don't believe it now." You are gone, Doctor, you are gone. Weston has you under his thumb." "Not at all, Bro. Sampson--" "I say he has. I'll wager a nice sum, that you believe in all these stories- about the miraculous influence of the Holy Spirit, and all such stuff." "So I do, to some extent. I believe the sinner must be regenerated by some stronger power than mere words and arguments." "Tut, tut, Doctor, where's the philosophy of such a theory? I say the Spirit does act, and acts only through words, as my spirit operates on you through my words and arguments." "Then all the Spirit's power is in words." "Yes, just so." ( I would ask you one thing here. If that be the case, why did not words aind arguments convert Paul, prior to his conversion, which seems to have been through or by some supernatural agency?" Oh, that was a miracle." "And so the operation of the Spirit in all cases, in one sense. I believe if the Spirit does not operate on the heart distinct from the effects of words and argument, the heart cannot receive those arguments, for the deprav- ity of the human heart is such that it is insensible to the spirituality of such things. We are told that God opened Lydia's heart to heai the Word, which Paul preached to to her. If all the converting power of the' Spirit is in the Word written and read, and spoken, where was the necessity of an immediate divine agency in riveting con- viction on her heart? ---She might have heard the Word and given an assent of mind to it, (not contradicting it,) like Simon the sorcerer, who believed after hearing, but had not Gol 'opened her heart' to understand it, she would have been like the sorcerer, believing, and yet 'in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity.' Sir, I believe that there must be some special agency outside of the   \          THE INVESTIGATION.        465 Word, or man would still be left 'in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.' I. cannot think that I am a subject of that grace, for I do not feel all right about the heart. I know the theory, know it by my feelings of de- pression, but I cannot receive the Spirit of it." "Oh, tut, tut, Doctor, you are getting on dangerous grounds. If we have to go through the great rigamarole which the Baptists prescribe, a man might live and die and never get religion. All we have got to do, Itell you, is to believe right now, that Jesus is the Christ, and be baptized for the remission of sins, or our siins will never be remitted." "But Simon, the sorcerer, believed, and was baptized, why was he still in iniquity?" "Oh, that was a case of a hundred." "It may have been, but that answer is not altogether satisfactory. I believe it was given as an example for us, like all other instances in the Bible. Although I believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Saviour of the world, and though I have been baptized, I cannot feel that my heart is right in the sight of Goc. Nor do Ikno w how to set it aright, it must be a 'gift of God,' a special influence affected by a special agency, or I am lost forever. 'In short, sir, I believe that my heart must be quickened by the Spirit's power, separate from the Word, or I am no better off than the sorcerer. There is a faith of which. I read in Holy Writ, that I cannot possess of my own power, for I have tried to receive it, but could not. I know the theory, but cannot- feel it. 'It is plain to see, but not, plain to feel. Flesh and blood cannot reveal it to me, though the Word be proclaimed by a Cicero, or by the combined eloquence of all the oratoracal powers of the world. I cannot feel the importance of. the Word unless God opens my heart." Mr. Sampson was puzzled how to answer the unexpec- ted declaration. Nor was it refutable. He felt the truth, and in his astonishment, kept silent. Dr. Boon continued to speak: "But I did not come hither, Bro. Sampson, to have a quarrel on this subject. Believe me, it was unintentional, and involuntary on my part." Mr. Sampson accepted the apology with an exceeding- ly slight bow.

"I have come again," continued the Doctor, " to have an interview with you, on the subject we were talking of, last week."  "I am sorry Doctor-" "You must not put us off any longer," he inter- rupted, divining the import of the preacher's unspoken sentence. "But my business is such-" "Remember that we hold our discussion only at night, now. You don't attend to business at night, do you?" Mr. Sampson did not. "You must either appoint some early time, Bro. Samp- son, or say positively that you will have nothing more to do with it. I have had talks with most of the gentlemen who usually attend, and they all say that it must go on forth- with. Mr. Semms will have to leave the place in a short time, and he is very anxious that it should terminate be- fore lhe' leaves." Mr. Sampson was in a quandary. "You must tell me this morning," continued Dr. Boon, -persistently, "you must tell me when you can meet us, so that I may notify the gentleman who attend." "Will next week do?" "Not so well as this. We ought to be getting along with this matter. Say you will meet us to-morrow even- ing after early tea?" Mr. Sampson reflected a moment and consented, though very reluctantly. 'The reader will wonder why he was so loth to prose- cute the discussion without intermission. We know of no reason , only he thought' by acting thus, the impres- sions of the past would be forgotten, before they pro- ceeded to the next points, thereby weakening the strength of his antagonist's argument. A very good scheme, by the way, had not the hearers been on the alert. v Dr. Boon took his leave after the exactment of the lromise, leaving the preacher vainly endeavoring to brighten up ideas, by dropping his head in his hands, as if to shut out irrelevant intruders. After a moment of thought, he drew his chair nearer tiie window to obtain a view of a passing steamboat, but h!1e chilly air which coursed through the little interstices, about the window panes, drove him hence, so he bent '   himself over the smouldering/embers of the grate, again subsiding into a deep reverv. "Weston is hard to beat," he muttered half aloud in the midst of his cogitations. "I begin to think that he has the best side of the argument, after all. I wish the thing was done with! I hope we will finish this week. I had as soon be dead, as to be always ding-dong-ing at this thing. This won't do for me!" he exclaimed, rising fromn his chair and seizing a book from the mantlepiece. "I must study, study hard by to-morrow night, for all my arguments will be called into use. I must make a better out than I did the last time, or we will lose those who - hear my defense. Boon is already gone; it is no use to tryto save him. He is as good a Baptist as Weston himself. When men get such notions in their heads, as he has, we had just as well let them go. Bro. Campbell himself could not save him, if he were here. Plague the luck! To think that an upstart of a close-communionist, should come here, and whip us out by argument like that fellow has done. Every body knows that close- commu- nion savors more of bigotry than Christianity, and yet they who practice it, sustain themselves remarkably well, and that even from the Bible. I am told that Weston tore up the Methodist Church in toto, and then made Sumner acknowledge that there was but one orthodox Church! He was a fool for doing it, for he mightilave known that the Methodists' creeds, could not be sustained by the Bible. Tifere is where Weston got him, and there is where he will get me. He will take the Bible and prove himself right, (which he is already doing) and then he will resort to history, which we all know is in his favor. However, I'll do the best I can. But this won't help me along any, sitting here thinking; I must study, study hard, and- there -I said it!-I said some one would interrupt me, be- fore I could read two pages. Good morning sir; take this seat. A fine and open day." "Yeas," drowled out his visitor in broad Irish dialect. "Got any terbacca?" unceremoniously asked Pat, as he drew his chair nearer the almost fireless grate, as a hint for a new supply of coal. It was only one of Mr. Sampson's debtors which had come to settle with him.

But this is not telling our story. Leander Hall had withstood many Storms since its erection, but the late calamity which had befallen the house, left its marks more visible than all previous out- breaks of nature, combined. Indeed, the air which ho- vered around it, seemed laden with the melancholy drip- pings of the catastrophe. The carol of the happy bird was seldom heard, but- the mournful cadence of the dove, appeared to linger around the premises. Bats were seen darting through the air, to their coverts, and spiders were fast preparing their winter domicils in every conve- nient nook and corner, these symptoms gave things an air of neglect and desertion. Old Mr. Bacon had settled down into the melancholy life of, a recluse. No visitors ever made the spacious apartments vocal with mirth and laughter, or even indi- cative of life. The parlors were closed and locked, and the library was seldom visited. Everything, animate and inanimate, wore a look of subdued sorrow. Even the servants were thus affected, for their shoeless feet, and tip-toe walking sounded more like the marshal drum of death, than the-echo of fobtsteps. Annie's name was nevei mentioned unless in a whisper beyond the reach of Mr. Bacon's ears. Her room (or the one she formerly occupied,) had been closed, and the sur- plussof wardrobe left behind, had been put out of sight. The roses that she always sheltered from the bleak winter were left uncovered, to perish in the ungenial climate, She was apparently forgotten, but how often the father reverted to her memory, it is not known, as he had be-, come morose and uncommunicative. His head had grown whiter, and the wrinkles in his forehead deeper. Also0his step mnore feeble and uncertain, some trouble was certainly preying on his vitals, but that trouble was never mentioned, nor its cause. Mr. Bacon was fast traveling to the, narrow confines of his long home! He knew it, and others too, who saw him. Life's lamp was rapidly consuming its oil. Even now the flickering glow, variated by the ebbing and par- tial suppletory of vitality, was strongly proclaiming, in a silent tone, an approaching dissolution of close prox- imity.   a         THE INVESTIGATION.        469 The dying autumn sang its own requiem by the passing breezes, exuberated by the odor of decay. The splash- ing waters of the Ohio took up the intonations of the death-tuned lyre, and a doleful note issued from her bo- som, as daily she rolled-her restless waters on in their unending journey. Who could stand on the. deserted threshold of Leander Hall, without a sensation of deep and indefinable depression? Who could trace the hands of dilapidation-(though in its first stage,) whose foot- prints seemed formed of neglect and sorrow-without a chill near the heart? Ah me! as we tread in memory, those gloomy halls, our hearts sink in this bitter msel- stroom of sorrow, whose whirl naturally bends the resist- less soul to the centre of its darkening motion. Man is a complex being, of vitiating composition, but he has yet marks of primeval forntation, which are to be traced by the trying vicissitudes of life. They ripen and ma- ture; they purify and manifest that spark of immortality which depravity in its voraciousness, almost swallows up. Look at that man whose face is clothed in a callous mask. Judge from his external appearance, and you must pro- nounce him lost to the nobler feeling of humanity; but h ah! stir the latent fountain of his heart with affliction, or affecting emotions, and the outgushings will be a more powerful disemboguement, than the dashing waters of the bold Niagara, comparatively speaking. School the heart as you may with lessons of stoicism, but Provi- dence has provided a master over that feeling. Thus dear reader we have your sympathies in spite of your resolutions to the contrary. You too, though you may boast of a brave and stern will, must bow to the shrine of such sensations. We all must feel melancholy in contempla- ting the ruins of time, and so must we shudder as the knell of by-gones lift up the veil of present's happiness, and discloses the sadness of Leander Hall! The notches of past joys were erased by this gusto of intersecting in- trusions, and the Hall, together with its associations stand before us as a monumental wreck of insatiable calamity.  Mr. Bacon had buried a young wife, and then a son, in the glory of youth, but he stemmed the tide of grief, without sinking, until now, when the only remaining hope was snatched away, he gave up the struggle and  &#xD;<pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC8270-00000238"/> sank. But he was silent as to his grief. In fact no one was suffered to enter hs presence to whom he might make it knowi. His doors were ever closed to visitors, and his agent was seldom admitted, and then only at given intervals. In Annie his last hope had centered, and with her his last hope had departed! CHAPTER XXXIII. THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, IN WHCH IT IS PROVEN THAI THE SPIRIT'S POWER IS NOT IN WORDS AND ARGUMENTS, iFO , - "Our Gospel came not unto you in tVord only, but also, ir POWER, and in. the HlQly Spirit"-1 Thess. i: 5. AFTER tea the next-evening, Dr. Boon hurriedly donned his overcoat, (for the weather was getting quite cool,) and went to Preacher Sampson's house, to accompany him to the rendezvous of the investigation. So fearful was he that something might happen to deter the preacher from being present, that he prudently adopted these measures as a forestallment. And it was well that he did, for Mr. Sampson had cast rMany undecided glances at his cloak and hat, and then out at the chilly prospect of nature, several times resolving to remain "in-doors," for fear of "taking cold from unnecessary exposure."' Mr. Sampson had no notion of killing him- self to please others.  One by one of the company gathered ih rapidly, and by seven o'clock the usual complement had arrived. It- was indeed strongly manifested that the interim from the last meeting had not lessened the interest felt by the party, for each man seemed very intent on the subject.   Messrs. Weston and Sampson seated themselves as usual, near the table, while Dr. Boon selected his old seat in a shaded corner, but not quite so far out of sight as was his wont, for he wished to have a full view, of M;ollie Weston, the while being'as near unobserved as possible. Of this surveillance, Moihe was wholly ignorant. Nor did she possess sufficient vanity to imagine such a thing, had the reasons for suspicion been more obvious. A tip-toe silence prevailed in the room, uptil Mr Wes- ton interrupted it. "We must not forget, my friends, to keep the point at issue before us, which, if I remember correctly, is: 'All the converting power of the Spirit is in the Word written, read, and spoken, as the spirit of man is in the ideas which he expresses; if the Spirit thus operating, fails to con- vert, then the case of that sinner is hopeless.' This I believe, is an epitome of your doctrine," observed Mr. Weston. "Yes, sir, it is about the sum and substance of the platform, which I have laid down."  Then please proceed to prove that the Spirit is noth- ing more than effect of words and arguments. Remem- ber at the same time, that every passage you cited to authenticate that doctrine, when we last discussed the point, was taken away from you, and made to prove that for which I contended, viz:-That some divine and imme- diate influence, separates and distinct from the Word, must operate on the heart. In short, God must open the heart to understand the Word, or it would be as seeds sown in stony ground. You must bear this in mind as you proceed." Mr. Sampson gave arvery slight acknowledgement of the request, by an inclination of the head, and he took up his train of arguments. "Allow me to adduce testimonies under the head of argument, from James i. 18: * Of his own will begat he us, by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first -fuits of his creation.' Hence we see, the Word colrtains the power; or rather, the Spirit's power is in the Word, by. which we are begotten. , Sir, again I say, in the language of our celebrated Bro. Campbell, ' We plead that all the converting power of the Holy Spirit, is ex- hibited in the divine record, * * * written, read and heard, which is-called the living oracles.' When these fail to convince, then the sinner is beyond mercy."  &#xD;<pb n="472-473" xml:id="VAC8270-00000239"/> "If such be your platform, why do you quote such passages as the one from James i. 18, in its defense?" "Because, such are conclusive evidences.,' "I think you are too fast. Let us look into it more closely. 'Of his own WILL begathe us,' it reads; show- ing that some special and divine iniuence is exerted in the regeneration of man. The text is in my favor. The Word may be spoken, read or written; but his WILL- his divine, and special interposition must beget us j through the Word, or the Word will have no more in- fluence on us, than it did on the blind Jews, who seeing, could not perceive, and hearing, could not understand; because their hearts had not been opened as Lydia's, who after understanding, attended unto the things of the Lordi Strange that you shold make use of such a passage to prove your proposition." "But you must ackowledge, Mr. Weston, that the ,Word is the instrument." ' It is in one sense, that is, to the conversion of the sinner, but is not the power that impells him to that con- version, but it is the SPIRIT. - God works on the sinner by his Spirit; and causes him to listen to the Word, which converts him, though if the former exercise were not first performed, the Word would be like seed sown in stony places, or cast out where the fowls of the air could devour and bear it away. Regeneration by the Spirit must first take place, or conversioa to implicit confidence and obe- dience, is impossible. If it were necessary for God to open Lydia's heart that she might attend unto the Word, it is equally so in all cases, as all are totally depraved." Mr. Sampson was a little crest-fallen, but- as he had another argument in store, he bore up. "I will give you a passage more difficult to digest the next time," he remarked as he drew his chair nearer to the light, and adjusted the gold spectacles, which glit- tered on his nose. He then took up the New Testament, and glided over its pages for a few moments,' deeply en- gaged. "Her it is!" he muttered half aloud, referring to 1 Cor. iv. 15; which he slowly read: "' For in Christ Jesus I have b7egotten you through the gospel.' What could be more conclusive, I would ask, than that which I have just read? Paul tells us that the Gospel was the power."   -i         THE INVESTIGATIO$.        473 "Too fast! too fast, sir! Paul says that he, not the gos- pel, begat them, but through the gospel.' Now, if you take it literally, you must make the sinner begotten or born of Paul'!! Can you do this! Think a moment. You know the word 'begotten' is translated 'born' by the most ortho- dox translators. Then, those of whom Paul was speaking, were born of Paul!! if we take a literal view of the pass- ge under consideration. This we know would not do, so we must put another construction on it. Now the Word is referred to as an instrument oJ conversion, not the power of regeneration. It proves no more that the power of the Spirit is in the Word written, read and spoken, than others cited, but if it proves anything at all for you, it proves that men are born of men, (spiritually!). This will not do; you don't contend for such, so when Paul spoke of having begotten the Corinthian Church, he meant nothing more than he had planted the Word- that he had been the instrument chosen for the propaga- tion of the Word, and tells them that he sends Timotheus to water, as did Apollos, but God 'gave the increase' 'for,' t  said he in the 20th verse, 'the kiigdom of God is not in word, but in PowER'. In the preceding chapter, he asks: 'Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers, by j whom ye believed, EVEN AS THE LORD GAVE TO EVERY MAN?' j -We are nothing but chosen instrumedts of conversion, effectual, only as God chooses to give regeneration. If this is not a proper construction, I can conceive of none, sir. The text certainly does not help you any, unless you shape it in a most ludicrous form, for Patul did not say that the Word begat, but he himself! If you wish to have it that way, you may, yet you cannot-be benefited by it." Mr. Sampson suddenly became aware of this much to his discomfiture. He attempted no refutation. "For fear," continued Mr. Weston, "that you may grasp at the idea of man lbeing regenerated by man, (men driven at bay, will seize any kind of implement of de- fense,) I will just refer you to several promises of God to I  the people, whom he took from the Gentiles to serve him. -  "s 1st. At a certain period in the future, he says: 'A new hpart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your -flesh, and:Iwill give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you.'

Here we have most clearly ex- hibited the radical change of the heart, and the conse- quent changle of life, of whichi God is the glorious author. Is this to be done by the mere power of words and argu- nments?-or :s manl to do tlis? ,s 2nd.

Are we to uliderstand by such lanlguage as tlis, that G'od intelided at some future day to present words and arguments to the Jews, which they 2ow reject and cause them to do this? Must the Word, which they have ever rejected, be the efficient in this? No! To convert them to his service again, he says that IIE will exert a special influence--will take away the heart of stone, and give a heart of flesh instead. He will do it himrself. and hle has ever done it, when done at all. He is the glorious author--he creates anew by his own power, using instruments for ccrtain purposes, but not in regen- eration. In the langiuage of the Apostle Paul, 'Even when we were dead in sins, [God] hath quickened us together with Christ,'--ie has done it of his own will and power. I have taken up too much time, I ask your pardon, Mr. Sampson. Proceed to your next proof," "The preacher obeyed, but slowly. Again, the New Testament was perused rapidly, in search of witnesses'. His countenance wore a puzzled look for)a moment, but he discovered the object of his search, and seemed more composed. He placed his foot on a deeply cushioned ottoman, and began. "I will make another point from this: 'I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make-thee a minister and a witness both :of these tlings which thou hastseen, and of those things in which I will appear unto thee. Deliv- 'cring thee frum the people and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto Gqd, thalt they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inher- itance among them which are sanctified by faith, that is in me.' Acts xxvi: 16--18. Hence we se,; the plan is in ,    THE INVESTIGATION.        475 the Word. Paul was to convert with the Word. The Spirit was in the power of the Word, and Paul was to use it to convert the Gentiles. What could be plainer? You will find this argument more difficult to get clear of than you imagine. Indeed, I hazard nothing in assevera. ting that you can never touch it by confuting argument. Of this I feel confident, and under this I rest assured." Dr. Boon became so much interested, that he left his obscure seat and drew nearer to the speaker. The two members of the Reformation changed their positions in their seats, the while manifesting a breathless anxiety. All were on the qui-vive to hear the answer. Some predi- cated hope on the invulnerable character o the adduced points, that is, those who were with Mr. Sampson. Even Dr. Boon began to hope that he was right after all, though he could notfeel so.  A silence of a moment ensued. Mr. Weston was gather- ing points, but the silence was mistaken for inability of sustaining himsfelf. Mr. Sampson anticipated him without discretion. 'Acknowledge at once, Mr. Weston, that you cannot set aside what I have produced, and we will proceed with out delay." "I would not set it (the passag6 under-consideration) aside, if I could, nor any other in the Bible, it makes no difference how seemingly inconsistent it might be. The Bible was not written by. chance, neither was any instance that is related in it, recorded by chance. It is a complete arrangement of inspiration, and cQntains all that 'is designed for us to know as concerns our religious sen. timents." "Then you will suffer that passage to pass by as argu- ment! triumphantly exclaimed the preacher. "Not with the construction which you put on it." "Hiw then? It conveys my ideas exactly. What else can you do with it?" he asked quickly, apprehending that some unforeseen blow was portending. If the chance for establishing your point rests on that passage, sir, I should think that yours is a desperate case. We will see what can be done with it. Can you say positively that the power of turning from Satan unto God, rested in Paul, or the Word which he was to preach?"  &#xD;<pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC8270-00000241"/> 476       LEANDR   rHALL.  "Of course in the Word." "You cannot say that, sir, for you know that God told Paul. that he sent him to do this! and we suppose the Word was the instrument to be used by Paul. We can- not think that the power of regeneration lay in Paul, but the power of planting, and that was by preaching, in which he abounded. The Gentiles must have the gospel, and Paul was a chosen instrument to preach it to them; to tell them of the unsearcheable riches of grace, of which they were now heirs through Jesus Christ. Therein laid Paul's power. But God had a work to do also; he had to quicken the sinner, dead in sin, to life with Christ. 'For,' says the apostle, 'by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not-of yourselves! it is the gift of God!' Well might he say: 'I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. And well might Peter say: 'Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar'people; that ye should shew forth the praises of HM, who had called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.' It is God who influences the sinner to turn from his wicked course, and not man, though man is made an instrument of the Word, and the Word is made an instrument of converting man .to obedience and belief, but the Holy Spirit has His distinct mission, and that is to quicken, to regenerate the sinnerr who is dead in trespasses and sins, consequently ignorant of spiritual things. If you can make anything else out of this, you may do it, but remember that God promised to Paul the honor of preaching the gospel effectually, and not to the Word. But the power of regeneration is in the Spirit, and the Word, only as assisted by this special agency, has effect in coivertion, not regeneration." Mr. Sampson was not prepared for this) answer, nor any one else present. Dr. Boon gave up all hope of their theory, because .he saw no grounds on which they might retreat and defend themselves.  One of the lay-members of the Reformation cast an imploring look at their preacher, butvto no avail. Mr. Weston continued: "That some special agency is needed in the regenera- tion of the sinner, is incontrovertable from the following facts. The Scriptures teach that God gives repentance. Christ was exalted a Prince and a Savior, 'for to give   V   .TnHE INVESTIGATION.          4" repentance unto Israel and remission of sins.' Acts v:-81. Now by the phrase giving repentance, he does not mean theprivilegeto repent, for they had that privilege, but none repented but those whom God inclined to do,.so, or those to whom God gives repentance. But can any one think-that God gives repentance and remission merely by the preach- ing of the Word? Many hear the Word, but it is given unto but few to repent. The obvious meaning of the apostle when he uses the above expression is, that God inclines men by his bloused Spirit to repent, that he may grant to them 'remission of sins.' And again: 2 Tim. ii: 25,' 26. 'In meekness instructing those that oppose them- selves; if God peradventure will give them. repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; and that they may re- cover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.' The-truth was before them. They had heard it; but would not receive it, be- cause 'the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for theyare foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.' And man is ' dead in sins'; but God is looked to by the apostle as the efficient agent in bringing him (man) to repentance. If the language just cited don't teach that some distinct operation from the Word must regenerate man, then it is impossible for language to express-as much." Things were getting worse. Mr. Sampson bethought himself. A struggle was made for his recovery which ran thus : i "-We are told that 'the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;' what could be said in a plainer style? "Nothing, Mr. Sampson; but does it say that the com. mandment enlightens alone? Does not Paul say that 'the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit?' We admit that the Word is enlightening, but not without an immediate influence of the Holy Spirit." "Then what do you do with this: 'The entrance of thy Word giveth light, and makes the simple wise'?" "Nothing; we would not have it removed, were it in our power. To find out what the text means, we must find out to whom it gives light. Now listen. 'For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks-seek after wisdom;  &#xD;<pb n="478-479" xml:id="VAC8270-00000242"/> 478      LEAND1B   BAtLL. but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them WHrtc ARS CALLED both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the visdom of God.' Now we have those whom the, Word enlightens-tlose that 'ARE CALLED' by the Spirit of God. So also might the text, 'The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul,' be applied. Whom does it convert'? Those that alre called 'L the Spirit.' The sinner is regenerated, he is called and the Word now converts him to bellef-its arguments are re- ceived willingly, but not until bliadness is removed. In this sense the Word converts and in no other. The Word is 'foolishness' and a 'stumbling block.' to all, except those whom God calls by his power, or those upon whom he oper- ates by his Spritrthose whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he alsojusti- fied. Without this distinct power of Gd, the Word to us would be 'foolisl'ness and a 'stumbling block."' "Then sir, according to your theory,j there would be no use of the Word, no use of preaching,. and in fact, t agency of man would be required at all," replied: Mr. Sampson, hurriedly. Yet if' man did not answer to the' call, I would not dare say that he. could be saved. We are commanded to preach, as were the Jews to blow the rams' horns around the walls. of Jerico; but- our preaching regenerates the sinner'no more than the blowing of the horns made the walls fall. The walls fell by the power of God, aaid so is-the sinner regenerated by his power. If the horns had, not been blown, however, according to commandm ent, the walls of Jerico would have stood, though God had the power to fell them. Just so with the case of the sinner. God had cgmmlanded the Word to be preached, and has promised through it he-would convert the sinner, but if it is not preached, read or written, then God is under no obligation as to promise to convert, though lie has the power to do it outside Qf means, He can regenerate the sinner by his own power, and then put his Word in the sinner's mouth which will convert him to the belief in God, but the latter mission he has given to the propaga- tors, of the Gospel, promising to be with the Word, land to rivet it on the sinner's heart, when spoken acceptably. I 'might ask you what good did the, spittle and clay do   THE INVESTIGATION.       479 to the blind man, since Christ opened his eyes by his own power? But Christ saw proper to make use of them as means, therefore, we have no right to question their utility. What good did the washing in the pocl do? Did not Christ exert a distinct power in opening the blind man's eyes? 'Certainly. It was a command of Christ's and that was enough for the afflicted man to know. I am commanded to preach and'teach, with the pionlise of success, though the merit of that success lies not il any thing that I have done, yet as Christ commanded, I must ,obey, expecting a fulfillnient of his promise in full confidence of faith. The power is in him, and should I teach unacceptably, the Word would have no more effect than it did on the blinded Jews. Indeed, with 'the Apostle, I may truly say: 'I, have planted, Apollos watered, but it is God who gave the increase.' David prayed :' Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me,' and yet he had the Word writ- ten and read. This plainly shows that some power is essential, distinct from the Word. A supernatural influ- ence is prayed for inthis case, and there are many other such instances in the Bible." Mr. Weston was rather lengthy, but we trust his hear- ers understood his meaning. Mr. Sampson turned slightly askance as he closed, and cleared his throat, which had gathered a very formidable barricade of "cob-webs " by disuse. The excitement became more intense. Dr. Boon moved closer still. Mr. Semms drew a long and loud breath, which could not fail to attract attention. Hope was receding from Mr. Sampson's grasp. He saw it, and made one more desperate effort in tones of deep modulation, and a spirit which threatened exorcism to the disputant.' "Sir, we may take up the lofg train of conversions, from the day of Pentecost, and we find that all were converted by the Word." "Grant you that the Word concerts, but does it regen- erate?- The sinner is represented as. being 'dead,' how can the mere Word reach him, unless quickened to the knowledge of it? Is conversion equivalent to regenera- tion? Does not the former merely mean to convince or to turn from one belief to another, as considered, a gen-  &#xD;<pb n="480-481" xml:id="VAC8270-00000243"/> 480       LANDER HALL.  eral term?' And does not the latter denote a new birth  How can the dead' be convinced, until quickened?.--how can the sinner, dead in trespasses and in sin, be converted or reached by the Word until quickened by the regenera- ting Spirit of God?"  "Well, to stick closer to the meaning, I will say that I can bring up instances, where regeneration is repre- sented as being through the Word. The first is: 'Re-  pent and be baptized every one of you for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.' Of course then they had notyet received that gift. They, however, gladly received his Word and were baptized; We have then the first three thousand regenerated by gladly receiving the Word, and by being baptized. This is an indisputable fatct, and is as clear as noon-day." "Allow me to ask you one question. The WTord had been preached before, by John the Baptist, and by Christ himself, and by the seventy apostles, and by the twelve, and at Jerusalem too, why did not the Jews hear and believe before the day of Pentecost?" Mr. Sampson did not know. "I'll answer the question, if you cannot. Those whom Peter was addressing, had been witnesses of Jesus' min. istrations, and they had eyes to see, but could not per- ceive, and had ears to hear but could not understand. In short, the spirituality of Christ's Kingdom had not been revealed to them as it was to. Peter whom Christ told that he had been instructed by the Father. In their blind infatuation they persecuted and killed their Sa. viour! but still the promise was to them and to others. Whom?  Hear Peter's answer: 'As many as the Lord our God SHALt CALL'! Then those who received the Word gladly had been called by some divine power, and that power was the Holy Spirit. Or, as Peter says in his first general epistle: 'Elect according to the fore-knowl- edge of God the Father, through. sanctification of the spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.' And ' which according to HS ABUNDANT MERCY HATH BEGOTTEN us again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jestu Christ from the dead.' Hence we  see that those who received the Word 'unto obedience' were influenced by the Spirit, this new birth not consist- ing in obedience, but a regeneration which prompted      .           .   obedience, or rather that which opened the heart, that tltey attended unto the things of the Lord." A nervous hitch of the- chair, was all the reply Mr. Sampson made. "Please proceed with your train of converts, Mr. Sampson," said Mr. Weston, laying the book down, which he had been holding in his hand. "The second is: ' Now that many of them which HEARD THE WORD believed, and the number of the men was about five thousand.'" "Which I would say, Mr. Sampson, if the converting power of, the Spirit, were ini words and arguments, only, all would have believed, as all heard the Word, but as the Spirit's operation is distinct from the Word,all could hear the Word, but none believed but those whom God called by the Spirit. That's a poser to your doctrine. So then the five thousand converts were not regenerated by the power of the Word at all, but by the Spirit which opened the heart to understand the Word, and obey to it, else all would have believed, as all heard it, and the Word of it- self is as potent on one as another. As only a part be- lieved, the Spirit actuated only a part to believe, though all heard the Word. That passage is not against, but for me." There was a long pause. To put all end to the prevailing and painful silence, Mr. Sampson proceeded: "Our third exemplification is found in Acts v. 14: i 'And believers were the more added to the Lord, multi- tudes of both men and women.' Women here are men- tioned as well as men." "But, Mr. Sampson, we must find out who were be- lievers. Not the mass of people, though the mass heard the Word. Now, Paul says: ' Our gospel came not unto  you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy. Spirit, and in much assurance.' Now, it is evident that the power of the Holy Spirit, was not in the Word as Paul separates them. As he also says: 'By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God,' then we must conclude that those believ- ers were those who were chosen 'to salvation through Banctification of the Spirit and- belief of the truth: whereunto he CATT PT them by the gospel, to the obtain- "  &#xD;<pb n="482-483" xml:id="VAC8270-00000244"/> 482       LEANDER HALL. ingoof the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.'-Thess. ii. 18, ".. I hope you all understand it, if not I will try to make it plainer." All acquiesced by silence, so all understood. Mr. Sampson went on to the following point, hoping by rapidity to call attention from his antagonist's argu. ments.                    . '"Our foulrthi- example we find, Acts viii. Philip went to Samaria and preached Christ to them. 'And hten they believed Philip, preaching the things concerln- ing the Kingdoni of God and the name of the- Lord Jesus, they were baptized, both men iand. women.' So the Samaritans- were regenerated by the Holy Spirit as in the power of the Word."  "You shouild have, of all cases in thel Bible, left that one out, Mr. Sampson." "Why so?" "Because, the account of Simon the sorcerer is in it, to speak against the faith that comes of words and arguments, alone. I will acknowledge thatthereis a faith that comes by wordsand arguments, but is not regeneration. To give you a fairspecimein of such faith as you contend for, I refer you to the sorcerer. lie believed we are told, and was baptized, yet Peter told him that he was a sinner. Ilis faith was the power of arguments, and the miracles which were wrought before him. The faith of others was the faith which ' ovcrcometh the world;' 'a gift of God;' or those who'abounded ' in hopeothrough the power of the lHly Spirit.' If the power of the Spirit had been in words and arguments, as you say, Simon would have been regenerated and truly converted, but as it was, he was not, he only belieed, but lie did not perceive the spiiitual- ity of the doctrine, as he thought that the Holy Spirit was an attainment to be purchased by money. It was getting late, so a suspension move was acted on, and approved, with the agreementto meet the next night. Mr. Sampson -hurried- off alone, though the lay. brethren offeied their company. In a mcment the parlor was cleared of company, ex- cept Dr. Boon and Mollie. The former had tarried to hears from Annie Bacon, at least-that was-the avowed ex- cuse, though, we strongly believe that sonie more power- -ful;iicentive, influencedhim.    tfI   ItNVESIOAQTION.      488 Molhe was just in the receipt of the letter which we have laid before the reader in the foregoing chapter, but her liberties of revelation as to Ann1ie's whereabouts, were no less restrained, so Dr. Boon was but Jittle wiser on that score-when he left, than he was previously. As he returned home, he looked up and beheld the round silvery-cast moon, smiling placidly, as she floated in beds of snow and ice, amidst the concave of the " up- per deep," and a peculiar sensation crept over his heart. The cold winter winds were arming themselves with the breath of the frigid climes, and before them came their premonitory heralders, which consisted of autumnal visi- tors. The winged tribe was safely ensconced in its winter cavetoes, and the creeping insect had yielded to instinct, and long since sought out quarters wherein to shelter itself frorA the dreaded season. The night wore its chilly robes, and the dancing zephyr mocked all feel- ings affected thereby. Nature's soft voice, seemingly disturbed by frequent gustos of unmanageable gales, now and then inspired the soul witi deepest feelings of inde- finable awe. A slight tone of senescence lingered in the unvoiced strains-of the sobered nionumeints of the pres- ent, linked to the past by faint resemblance. Dr. Boon strode his homeward course, while spirits of gloomy vis- ages, brooded over his soul. He had been drinking from the intoxicating bowl of love, but when the bracing, at-. rmosphere, restored the thoughts of ilis situation, the draught was dashed from his lips, cre his thirst was quenched. In the solitude of night's variegated, but un- social companions, he yielded to the bitterest feelings which his grief could inflict. How wretched, how mis- erable, how indesirable was life to him! And ho felt like dispensing with it, 'But that the dread of something after death,- The'undiscovered country, from whose bourn  No traveller returns,--puzzles the will; And makes us rather bear those ills we have, Than fly to others that we know not of."

"Itlt Doctor these things ae naturally incident to all Churches."  "I know in some degree, they are, yet I ask, what moral influence, has our religiornexerted permanently on our1 comlmunity! The town of M--  is not improved in morals one iota. The masses of the people were drift. ed with the Current iteformation; but when the tide fell. religion fell with it; and we arc like the houses deserted by the evil spirits, but occupied again thereby, and 'sev. en times worse' "than before. You kno"w this, Bro, Msayield, but you cannot prescribe any remedy," said the Doctor, despondently. '"We must have another protracted meeting, Doctor, therein lies our only hope. It will be a benefit to us all more especially to the younger portion of the Church; for they need some influence to hold them to their views."   THE INVESTIGATION.        485 (Perhaps they do, Mr. Mayfield, but a protracted meet. ing is not that influence, it must be something else.) Dr. Boon remained silent for some time, reflecting on what Mr. Mayfield had said. "If we hold another protracted meeting, Bro. May- field, must we do as we have heretofore done?-deny the Spirit's rower?" he asked after a long pause. "Pshaw, Doctor, what can you make of it, only as it is in words and arguments?" "Too weak, too w'eak, Bro. Mayfield. 'Quench not the Spirit-whereby ye are sealed unto the day of re- demption,' so we are commanded. I fear, sir, we are de- nying its influence,-in short, I fear we have the form of godliness but deny the power thereof. Protracted meet- ing, may be forever continued, bllt in the absence of the Spirit, we can do no permanent good." I see. Doctor, that you are lost to us. Your faith is too weak in the cause." "You will acknowledge nevertheless, Bro. Mayfield, that Iam correct in my statements as regards our Church. You know that we are in error on some points." "I know that we lhave taken a great many into our CliuroIh, whom we canlnot discipline." "And why?  The Apostle tells us that 'the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;' does it look like we walk in the Spirit, from our fruits? John says: ' Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin : for his seed remainctlh in himn and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.' Does it look like the larger portion of our Church arc born of God? Have not most of our members returned to thleir ' wallowing in the mire,' under the similitude ot the sow? ' "'Some have lleld out taithfullv." "And who are that some? Those who, previously to joining us, were sober and moral persons externally; and those who came to us from-other denominations. I say in true earnestness, Bro. Mayfield, and much to our own shame, that we, as a denomination, are indebted to the Baptists, and Methodists, and other denominations, for nearly all of our faithful members. Look at the Church, and see for yourself, if you db not believe me. I think we have about thirty members that are to be relied on as far as Christianity goes, and most of them come  &#xD;<pb n="486-487" xml:id="VAC8270-00000246"/> ^860       L EA N  D B R H A LL . from :other denominations, and the others were of rmral principles before joinling us. T!s youi know is true." '"-Bt Doctor, all ldellniinlations hold protracted mebt- in gs occqasilonally, for the good of the nemlbers, anlld all appecar to need them. Besides, some of the nmembers of :o01"Cliuriic, are doing w;ell who did lnot belong to any Churchl prior to thleirj'oining us. Hlere's yourself, foriin- stance. Whlere is a man in our country, who walks more worthy of his vocation, than you?" "'And wlhat am I? 'Do I not find that I have merely the form of godliness?-That I hlave been grasping after shadows instead of substances, and that I stand to-day, possessed of nothing but the dying echoes of a wild in- tiftuatioll? And are there not others ill my situation, lho to-day wouldw illingly renounce this dogma,-bap- tism for the renission of sins, were it not for their ride?" Mr. Mayfield renlailed silent. "Again," continued Dr. Boon "where has there been one drunkard, one ganibler, or onie railer, effectually re- formed by our religiol? They have all, scarcely without an exception, gonc back, (if indeed they Were ever from them,) to the fruits of the flesh. Now, the apostle tells us what those fruits are, and I think we might enumer- ate them, and without any violation, each one could be identified in our Church. In short, Bro. Mayfield, we are crowded with the fruitsof the flesh. It is a rule, 'where- fore, by their fruits ye shall know them' which, if made the rod of our measurement, what would be the verdict against us, but tiat we are still in the flesh, and live in the flesh? The Apostle tells us that such shall not enter the kingdom of Heaven. He also .tells us, that the fruits of the Spirit are ' love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentle- neSS, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, (how sparse- ly are we blessed with these,) against such, there is no law.' Ah, -Bro.'Mayfield, our Church tells the tale itself, without the aid of the controverting doctrine of our opponents. "I hope the cause of your disaffection, Doctor, may be removed by our next protracted meeting," replied Mr. Mayfield, hardly knowing what to say. "My disaffection results, not from observation only, but from personal feelings. I know I lack the Spirit some way, but cannot tell-how. All the protracted meetings in   THE INVESTIGATION.        -487 Christendom cannot remove this aching void, while we deny the power of the Spirit, separate and distinct froml the Word. I feel this sensibly. I have read Bro. Camlpbell's essay oni this subject, but the metaphysical doctrine did not o6ilighten me, I have read sermons from the most celebrated of our preachers, but all alike, have failed to impart the information I have so much de- sired. From a clause in one of Mr. Weston's sermons,- I have been able to gain more light, (though I under- stand it not, yet,) than from the whole gleanings of philo- sophical calculations which I have read, as issuing from Bro. Campbell's pen. I have read the Bible, and in it I found spoken of, a religion, which could not be reduced to a shadow; but it seems that ours has been. I feel as- sured that they are not identical, therefore I pine for that which is likened unto a man who built his house upon a rock for a foundation, against whichithie floods washed, and storms beat, but wa's unmoved. Yea, I want the re- ligion which supports\ us against all temptation-the Spirit which seals us 'unto the day of redemption." This is the kind I want, and this is the kind I know I have not. Mr. Mayfield looked puzzled and astonished. .He knew no reply to make, so he kept silent. Dr. Boon con- tinued: "W\e are told that the 'carnal mind is enmity against God,' so it is not to be wondered at, when we behold the condition of our Church; for it is evident that we ae  been grasping at shadows, and have missed the substances. If we liad the Spirit, which is imbued with the love 'that neither death, nor life,: nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor tlhiugs to come, nor heights, nor depths, nor any other creature,' could rob us of, we might hold -up, but, sir, the birth for which we contend, is nothing more than the birth of flesh; ' so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.' Talk not of protracted meetings bringing us right! the cry had better be, a prayer for the SPIRIt." "You are a hard case, Doctor. You have imbibed very peculiar notions from some source, and ideas that I anl- earful will cause you much trouble. You know the Bible says: 'Repent, believe; and be baptized, for the remission of sins. You have done this, so I cannot se what more is for you to- do, "  &#xD;<pb n="488-489" xml:id="VAC8270-00000247"/> ;I;V   w  w  \ ia Ai  X I A Z ILA A J * "I have repented, Bro. Mayfield thus: I have turned away fromn the world by being baptized. As to belief, I 'have the same kind of faith which I had before, and that s of doubting and dissatisfaction. You know Paul says of the Christian: ' Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Aba Father.' I have had no such faith, therefore I cannot think that I am right." "I am sorry, sorry Doctor, that you have fallen into such trouble unnecessarily. I would suggest that you have a talk with Bro. Sampson. Perhaps he can remove the cause of your disaffection." "I have had a talk with Bro. Sampson, and profited very little thereby, for he reduced our religion to a system of metaphysics, following in Bro. Campbell's old path." "Then talk with Weston, for you woln't rest until you do!" ejaculated Mr. Mayfield in a petulant strain. He was becoming impatient. "Thank you, thank you," responded Dr. Boon, in a mock, defferential tone, for he could not fail to perceive his :Brother's growing restlessness. "I will certainly avail myself of your advice," he added.  Mr. Mayfield arose to, go, but hesitated i moment, looking steadfastly into the fire. "What is it?" asked the Doctor, divining that some- thing unusual was on hand. "We want your assistance in procuring the services of Bro. Johnston, in our coming protracted meeting. Bro. Sampson said that I must see all the brethren this week, so that by our next meeting, we might know what move to make.. What say you to it?" Dr. Boon had but little confidence in their preaching, and disliked the iianner they adopted in carrying on a protracted meeting, so he did not make an unhesitating reply in the affirmative. "It will do no good Bro. Mayfield." he replied in rather a negative tone. "But we can re-call the backsliding members." "Who by this time begin to perceive the weakness of their faith I should judge." "'You are hard Doctor, hard. If you are not willing to assist, you should not try to pull us back, for you do ot know how much good might be accomplished by it." l          .      1 "JD A1 1 V id D i As Wl a'VL j *  v "' I cannot raise my finger against it Bro. Mayfield, but  the doctrine you preach will certainly lead many igno-  rant souls to perdition if their dependence is like mine. I  tell you Bro. Mayfield, our fruits are those of the flesh  instead of the Spirit. This you know to be true. The Apostle John tells us3 that if we have been born of God, or of the Spirit, (both are the same, see 1 John, v: 7,) we will not sin--our fruits will not be those of the flesh. Look at our Church at large! In what consist our fruits? In the very identical enumerations of the flesh, by Paul. Sir, this fact speaks much against us. If I assist in procuring Bro. Johnston's services, I Vwulld be bidding God-speed to what I conceive to be hcrettcal and  fatal doctrine. Yet I will not raise my finger against the brethren's wishes."  "We want your help, Doctor, and we are obliged to have it. We havn't members enough on whom we can rely, to carry on this thing." "Aye, there's the rub." "To lay all joking aside Doctor, you must come into measures at once, and let us try and (do something for our  Church, or it will drift by the board. You -must stand up for us. Look how long the Baptist Church has kept up here, with about a half dozen members, and that too, without a-pastor." "That is not astonishing Bro. Mayfield. They are bound by the Spirit, and not by mere vows from the lips." Mr. Mayfield was again fretted. Once le thought that he would just take his hat and leave, without ceremony, but the urgency of his visit fwould not permit it. "Let that b-, now Doctor, and come to the point. Say what you will do towards our contemplated project? Will you help, or not?" "I cannot, conscientiously." "You must lay aside your bothersome scruples, and help now, for it is a time of need." Dr. Boon hesitated. He did not know what was best to do. Once he was on the eve of giving hs consent, but the thought struck him that such night be tLe in- strument in sending deluded souls, unprepared, to their final account, so he folded his arms and stepped a space backward, signifying a decision of non-assistance.  &#xD;<pb n="490-491" xml:id="VAC8270-00000248"/> 90        -L E - A N D-ER H A-L L. Mr. Mayfield saw that he could do nothlng, so he left ]ighly incensed. -Ie communicated his luck to the Churcll, which created quite a stir in Mh . The broth- erhood denounced him, while the sisterhood bemoaned the loss. And such was the strait they were driven to, on the account of the misfortune that the delinquent brethren (those who D:. Boon said, had "returned to their wallowingin the mire ulnder the similitude of the sow ") were called on for help. Sbme, whose liberality exceeded their piety, responded very promptly, while others whose faith and liberality were both " dead," only shook their lieds at the call. It was hard to tell whethdr Mr. Sumner, or Dr. Boon, ran the highest in the scales of town gossip. Botl de- nominations united against them, but Mr. Sumner, as far as thought or intent went, was guiltless of the alleged charges, as the reader has been previously informed. Excitement! oh excitemient!-what a luxury to wo- men! When Mr. Mayfield told the news, Mrs. JCrow was one of the first to hear it. Scarcely taking time to swal- low a hasty dinner, she hurried to see a Canlpbellite Sister, her nearest neighbor, to be the hlappy communi- cant, but as it happened, the friend had heard it, so Mrs. Crow extended her field of operation, to nearly all of her female acquaintances of M-. It chanced to be a busy time with Dr. Boon, so le re- flected but little on the consequent effects of the conver- sation with Mr. Mayfield. He ordered his horse as soon as his friend departed, and left for the country, to begone until evening. He was hurrying to get back by nighlt, so that he could be at Mr. Weston's to note the progrless ot the investigation. In his absence, almost every kiln or report started, yet nothing but what was natural to female loquacity. In the new tide of excandescence, Mr. Sumuer ,ras not forgotten, as Miss Lankinston's anger had not subsi- ded. New reports, even more infamous (if possible) had been circulated, so that his excommunication was sure. The tidings of his prostration by disease, had not reached --,or the current of malignity mighlt have been stayed by sympathy.

"I'm tired!--laid meo a chair, Miss Matilda, and please have me a drink of water brought in.  How's your aunt? "She's well. Sister Crow. But where have you been that you should be, puffing and blowing so? Give me your bonnet." "Oh, I have been all over town, nearly. Girl, make haste with that water! WhVat are you doing at home, Miss Matilda, housed up like some old woman? You havn't been out to-day, have you? "Yes; I was down in town a few minutes this morn- ing." "Did you hear the news?" "What news?" "About Dr. Boon?" "What about him?" Oh, I can't. tell you what all! They are about to have a burst up between them some how, but I don't ex- actly understand it." "But tell me what you do know." "It's a secret, and ought not to be talked about, much in company." Tell me anyhow," persisted the anxious listener, mov- ing closer to the speaker. If I tell you, you must promise not to talk about it." "I will,solemnly." -Mrs. Crow forgot that she had been engaged all the evening in making known the "secret." "Wvell," she began, and to rock herself also, "thev say that he has had a falling out with the members of his Church, and has refused to help in engaging the services  &#xD;<pb n="492-493" xml:id="VAC8270-00000249"/> *   Z'3    L EANDER  HALL. of Mr. Johnston, to carry on a protracted meeting here which is to come off very soon."' "Al, indeed?" "Yes; and he has said that he has no faith in their re. ligion, at all. He alleges this as the excuse for not help. ing." "To be sure!" "Yes, and they say that all this is attributable to the influence of Mr. Weston." "I wonder!" "Yes, and they say that he (Dr. Boon) is trying to get Mollie Weston too." "I said it! That's the cause of his disaffection! What a pity for M-- that Mr. Weston ever came here, for we were living in peace and quietude until then." "Yes, we were," replied the indefatigable Mrs. Crow, mournfull'y, as she swung herself back in the soft cush- ioned chair. "We have suffered too, with the rest," she remarked, after thinking a moment. "Yes, we have lost Bro. Sumner, or as good as done it, for he will be excluded from Conference next week, so I predict. And he will then join the Baptists, as a mat- ter of course, he will be so exasperated." "And Annie Bacon," reminded Mrs. Crow, seeing that Miss Lankinston had forgotten her. "Yes, but that was not so bad. Annie, you know, was never very advanltageous to the cause." "You aire mistaken, I think. She performed her part as well as any other young girl, until Mr. Weston came here vith his heretical and ruinous doctrine." "Sucl a pity, old Mrs. Wilson died! then her place would never have been vacant," again lamented Miss Lankinston. "That was another misfortune, for she was a useful member to us."  "Yes; misfortunes never come alone." "There goes Dr. Boon, now! Don't he look badly?" "Let me see! Yes; I wonder where he has been?" M Out il' the country, I reckon. But I must go, Miss Matilda, for it is getting late. The sun's down. aint it?" "I don't know. If it is, you need not be in such a -haurry."            :   A; I A I - - - - - - V-    a  r            : Oh, yes, I must go. You must say nothing about the matter of which we have been talking, for I don't want it to get out from me. Good evening, Miss Matil- da." "Good evening, Sister Crow." Mrs. Crow had taken the rounds, and was returning relieved! The theme had been canvassed, and re-can- vassed by her, until she had formed it into a very good palladium, from a sparse compilement. Indeed, Mrs. Crow was an adept at gathering occult fragments, and arranging them into measurable features. The glaring light of the sun had yielded to the soft hues at twilight shades, variegated by the rays of the moon, who occasionally swept from behind-sonme dense cloud to obtain a view of the opaque hemisphere, and the little stars, twinkling from the depths of their beds, and emitting a shade of their spheroidal forms, blended the light to a pale cast, disturbed now and then by the frown of a cloud, borne by the will of the wind. As this swift breath from the icy regions kept the atmosphere well chilled, Dr. Boon buttoned his coat closely to his body, preparatory to :starting to Mr. Wcstoll's, for- he had caught the sound of the animated winds, and knew the inl ort. It was just, as we might call it, cleverly dark. And as yet, no one had passed on his way thither, so Dr. Booun did not hurry himself. After tea, Mr. Weston discovered that he had lost a book, which he would need that evening, so he hastily donned his " great coat," and went down in town to see if it were to be had at the book-store. On his way back he called to see if Dr. Boon had gone to his house, which fortunately was not the case, but the Doctor stood ready to start, as Mr. Weston walked in the shop. "Then I'll have the pleasure of your company home," said Mr. Weston, as he discovered the Doctor in his walk- ing accoutrements.  "A very lucky hit to me. Come in, Mr. Weston, and take a seat," he said, handing a chair. "No; our company will be waiting; let us hurry home- ward. You know it is some distance. As they walked on, the conversation very naturally fell on the subject of the discussion.  &#xD;<pb n="494-495" xml:id="VAC8270-00000250"/> - 4       L E-A aItD ER HAL t. "I feel cotiscious, Mr. Weston," said th&amp;eDoceto.,.( thit our Church is in error on this point, but there isndo odhaiee to remedy it.

I am told that the prayers of the unrighteous are of no avail." "And we aie told also that 'The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.' In what? In the bestowments of temporal and outside blessings as enumerated by the Apostle James v: 13-18. What right has a sinner to pray for temporal blessings, when he re- jects the Saviour of the world? None." "Then I would ask here, Mr. Weston, what right has he to pray for spiritual blessings?"  "Because Christ: died for him, and purchased him that right. Peter told Simon, the sorcerer, that he was yet 3 sinner,- though he told him to pray. He said: 'Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhapi   THEI INVESTIGATION.       49 the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the. bond of iniquity.' The sinner is confined to spiritual and personal blessings in his prayers, and the Christian's lati- tude is that of spiritual and temporal blessings as bestowed personally, or on others. In short, I would say to the sinner who is inclined to pray for others, or who is in- clined to pray for temporal blessings, that he had better pull the beam out of his own eye first, so that he may sec clearly, or how can he attempt to clear his brother's eye, or expect God to bless him, when he has not sought, nor obeyed Him?" "I think I understand you, Mr. Weston, but the mys- tery of the faith that 'overcometh the world' is still unre- moved." 4"Sir, that is between you and your God. He alone can enlighten you on the subject. My recommendation is prayer, fervent and unceasing. But do not think your chance lies in prayer, for if God chooses to lead your heart to a sense of your guilt before Him, and then pardons, He can do it. Let your prayer be for that." They walked on in silence for a moment. Mr. Weston was surprised at the state of affairs with Dr. Boon. He had no idea that he was thus exercised. Dr. Boon was the first to speak. "Still, Mr. Weston, what am I to do? I feel worse and worse every day. I have prayed, but it seemed like my prayers ended with the sound of my lips." "Are you not willing to accept Jesus as your Saviour? He has died for yoll, and remember you can do nothing but prav for his Spirit, and that there is no merit in your- self. The merit of-your salvation lies in the blood of Christ, which cleanseth us from sin. Pray to God, for the spirit of understanding, and He will bring your heart where you will see your own helplessness. Words and arguments of men cannot do this." Dr.. Boon shook his head mournfully, for he was out of heart.  - The "Queen of the night" rode on with ease in the silence of her glory, and the bright galaxy of heaven was broken by the shade-tint clouds, spotting the sky, as climbing the parapet of the ethereal tower, to gently lower their plumage now and then, in graceful descent towards the earth.  &#xD;<pb n="496-497" xml:id="VAC8270-00000251"/> "O       LEANDE-R HALL. A ray from the moon fell on Dr. Boon's countenance, which revealed to Mr. Weston the intensity of his suf- fering, "Would that I could feel as you do!" exclaimed the former in despair. "You are setting too much store upon your own abil- ity, my friend. Do not think that religion is a thing that you can possess of your own power, but you must have the assistance of divine interposition." Dr. Boon was sileiit. Mr. Weston continued: "Our Saviour has done much for us, and all that can be done for fallen man. You have an interest in his-blood, as well as I, if you will but trust." TIhe lenitent was still silent. -"Renlember, if you are saved, it will not be by the merit of anything that you have done, or anything that you can do, but through His meritorious sacrifice on Calvary; therefore do not ilink to build a barricade of works, but rather trust to Christ's righteousness." 'They walked on. The silence of the night was inter- rupted now and then 1by the row of some noisy boys, or the btigle of some would-be musician. "If our- Saviour 'has done so much," continued Mr. Wcston, "and if we canlnot trust IIini, what interest can yol suppose that we harve in that sacrifice? None! none. Ulbelief is lte damning sin of man. He who rejects Christ in faith, rejects his soul's salvation. But do not deceive yourself, niy friind, about the nature of this faith. I will say agailn, it is the gift of God.' Trust not to the mere assent of the mind, for devils-believe and tremble even as you might do now, but the sinful nature of devils is not to be chalnged like yours. lWhen you can arrive at the point, i n wiclh you are willing to trust in the Saviour alone for salvation, eschewing all self-merit or self-help, and when you can see yourself lost, and justly lost,.then the Spirit does hIis work. And then you will be enabled to cry with humble resignation: 'Thy will be done, oh God!' And thent will you be converted to the pure-teach- ings of Ilis Word, and not until then. It is one'of the main features of the Christiatn-submission to the will of God. The Christian never contends against His will; it matters not how seemingly hard it is. When you can feel, as I have described, Doctor, then you have nothing t   TUNE SINVBTIOGTIO.        4 97 to ear, for our Saviour has then stepped between yo  and future justice, to bear the punishment that is duo you. till Dpl            r. ad no epl. r. ston continued, after a momenit: ;'Thlugh I may preach and teacl you, till the Ireal of day, God must bring you to such feelings.

Again the shining orb of night confronted Dr. Boon, face to face, perhaps revealing more tha the searchiing  rays of the sun could.  . ;' I know your flelings," continued Mr. Westol. "I have been in the -same valley, and when I was led out- side of its gloomy portals, it was done. without ny own strength.

They walked on in silence for a moment, but Mr. Wes- tol interrul:pted it again. "It is not to' be \wondlered at that those who have never felt the influence of the Spirit, should deny its power, for the latural manl cannot receive those tlings. Men who take the Bible as their intallibleguide, and who es- chew the teachings of their fellow creatures, which are to the contrary,    , su e, tough not born -again, cau learni- trom it that there   a i i a nfluence, but they ciaunotfeel it in the designed sense, without additional   TUE INVESTIGATION.        499 aid. Now, for instance, you think that there is an out- ward influence exerted on the heart, and distinct from the Word, but you do not feel that influence, therefore, you are no better off than those who deny it, only you are more liable to grant its power. And you are placed in the attitude where you can pray for it."  "I think I understand the theory, Mr. Weston, but I do not feel it as I should. This I am sensible of because I have nlot the faith which begets submission, and which 'overcometh the world,' nor the love which 'casteth out fear.' Such love and faith I know are spoken of in the Bi ble, but I possess them not. I know I believe that Jess isihe Christ, the Saviour of the world, but whether he is my. Saviour specially, I cannot say that I believe, therefore, I am still in doubt. Oh I want the faith which Paul terms: 'a gift of God,' and which 'overcometh the world,' or I feel that I am no better off than the sorcerer, who believed and was baptized, but was 'still in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity,' because his heart was not righ t in the sight of God." "I perceive, my friend," suid Mr. Westoni, after a short silence, " that you. have all the information on the subject, which is in the power of man to give, so I recommend you to go to the Lord, and him only, for succor, for it is 'not of him that runnethl but of God that sheweth mercy.' Cast your care on him, ' for he careth for you.' Conlsider your own helplessness, and the power of God." By this time they had reached Mr. Weston's residence, which put a stop to the conversation. The main part of the company had assembled before Mr. Weston and Dr. Boon arrived.. Preacher Sampson at once jumped at very correct con- clusions, when he saw Dr. Boon in company withI Mr. Weston, and he even suffired a sliglt frown to Wreath his face, which was perceptible to those who were ob- serving his countenance. The br&amp;thren lay-members shrugged their shoulders instinctively, for apprehension, was not altogether distant fronm their minids. Mr. Sampson cleared his throat, and. donned his glasses with a nonchalant air, as a pIreliminary to the 'iscnssion. But forgetting himself, he -cast anothber look of. ueasi-  &#xD;<pb n="500-501" xml:id="VAC8270-00000253"/> 500      1 4 :  A N PIR A, I. .  L ,ness at, Dr. Boon, who had again selected a seat in a shaded part of the room, to avoid notice. All was silence until Mr. Sampson began  CHAPTER XXXV. THE INVESTIGATION CONT , INUES, IN WICII IT IS PROVEN THAT SOME POWER OUTSIDE OF THE EFFECT O1 WORDS AND ARGU.- M]ENTS MUST BE USED TO REGENERATE THE SINNER, FOR, "No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath sent me, drawz hir!; and 1 will raise him up at the last day.': -John vi: 44. IN order to proceed with system and understanding, we must take up the long, train of colverts, from the day of Pentecost, until the close of the Acts. Oin yesterday night we made mention of several, which brou;ght, us to the case of Philip and the Eunuch. ' Then Philip opened his month and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.'-Acts viii: 35-36. In tlre narrative of this chapter, we have the regeneration of a soul by the Word preached, only. Now if the Spirit of God opera- ted in that 'case, it did through words alnd ardguments alone, and was the mere effect of them. This case is in- disputable, and brooks no cavil whatever." "Still, 1 join issue there, with you, Mr. Sampson. True, the Word-was spoken, but does it prove the absence of divine and distinct influence? I think not. It- appears that the Eunuch was an object of special grace, as Philip was directed to go to him by the Spirit. Indeed, the cir- culmstance 6f his conversion seems to be an event of spe- cial and divine interposition. God certainlyopened the heart of the Eunuch to understand the Scriptures, after Philip joined him, as he did Lydia's, for none are righteous, and the natural man cannot receive the things   T"E INVE STIGATION.       501 I A of the Spirit. Were it not for this consideration, your. train of converts, might be substantiated, but God has issued the decree, that man is depraved, and tlat 'his heart is set in him to do evil, thercfore he will not turn and obey God, without some special aid, because suclh acts are not of his nature, therefore, he loves them not. Gobd knows when to move on that heart. In this case, Philip was made the instrument of the Word, but it was the Spirit's provinbe to rivet conviction, as we are told that, 'The kingdom of God is not in Word, but in POWER.' If the convertion of the Eunuch were not a case of special and divine grace, no language could describe a: circunil- stance that was. You may have the instance as you/ please, but-it appears to me, that the Eunuch was called J by some special and divine influence, or lie would not have suffered the plebeian Jew, to have beell his instruc- tor. God had inflnenced his heart by his own power, and he then chose the Word through Philip, to be an instru- ment of his conversion. David prayed for an understandingll of the Word, showing conclusively that it cannot be un-  derstood in a proper sense without divine assistance." "But you can't prove that the Spirit, distinct from the Word, operated on the Elunuc'h," persisted Mr. Sampson, fearing the thing was going against him.  "I have proven that the Eunuch's conversion was one of special and divine interposition, if that is not enoulgh, I think that it would be impossible to please you." Mr. Sampson cast a look around at his brethren to see what effect it was having on them, but all happened to be looking at him, so he gained but little information.  He went on to the next case, in regular routine, which- was: "Saul of Tarsus, the persecutor of Christians. While traveling to Damascus, on the road,-a light suddenly   : shone around him, and he fell to the earth, when lie heard a voice saying: 'Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?- I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.' This case is certain- ly one of indisputable certainty. He both saw, heard, and believed, and was baptized." "So I know, Mr. Sampson, but if all- the converting   power of the Spirit were in words and arguments, Paull should have been converted before, for he heard the preaching of the eloquent proto-martyr Stephen, bat  .1  &#xD;<pb n="502-503" xml:id="VAC8270-00000254"/> @0      IS  A21 B-Nt JBH A ATRALL. withal, consented to his death. Now I contend that thte Word has no influence (that is in conversion,) unless ac- companied by the distinct influence of the Holy Spirit. tn short, the Spirit must regenerate the 'dead' heart ere the Word can convert the soul from the service of thi world. Well, here is an instance to verify it. Paul had heard the Word proclaimed time and again, by the most eloquent propagators, yea, by those moved by the fIoly3 Ghost, but it had had no effect on him. In time God chooses to call him by his Spirit, and lie responds, nlot daring to question the saying, 'I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.' What a striling proof of my doc- trille, and yet you dare make a quotation of it." Air. Sampson felt that he had been too hasty in his ci- tations, and determined in the future to be molre cautious. He nmade no attempt at trying to controvert his opp'1o- nent's position, for he felt that he was oorrect. Luke had recorded facts against him, for Luke said that Paul abet- ted in person, the persecution of Stephen, who ldied pro- claiming the Word. If all the converting power of the Spirit had been in words and argumenits, Paul would have been converted then. -Strange! strange Word it'is, that has all the converting power in it, and will rivet con- viction some times and not at others! We would like for some of the religio-metepliysicians to philosophize tliat strange inconsistency into reason. Mr. Sampson proceeded to the next instance: ' Eneas furnished a seventh case. And Peter said to him, 'Etleas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole;-arise and make thy bed.' Here is another case of words;" "And yet you say that Peter tells the infirm that JEsrs CiHRIST MAKES him whole! Peter spoke the words but Christ put forth the power, is the inevitable conclu- sion. Certainly, Mr. Sampson had forgotten it, when he made use of that passage., The next case was brought up. ' The citizens of Lidda and Saron furnish the eighth case. Of them we read' All that dwelt in Lidda and Saron saw Eneas made whole by Peter, and they turned ' to the Lord.' The people of Lidda and Saron were con- verted by :what they saw." t'eihou, sir you make a flat contradiction ot your   TUB I N.VTsl   A TI.      .03 heading proposition of this point, for you expressly said that miracles could not convert! The case of Eleals was certainly a miracle! I say they cannot coilnvert cither, ;o their ovnl power, but God chooses them to arrest the at- tention, yet all the while his Spilit does the work of re- generation. Thle next case, I think, Mr. Sampson, is,   i that of Dorcas, the woman 'fillI of good works :tad alms  deeds,' which was also a miracle, so you may pass it on as you say miracles cannot convert.' From ths miracle we are told many were i!duced to believe, but as we both  agree, the power of regeneration waMs not in. the miracle."  Mr. Sampson's only alternative was to proceed to the following instance, to hide his embarrassnment: "Cornelius of Cesarea, bringi us to the ninth case.  This is so notorious, that it needs only to be nanced. Pe-  ter told the words of salvation to Corneliu s and his  housellold, and they believed, and were baptized."  "And also were miraculously sustained by the Holy spi- : rit, which came in addition to the Word," suggested  ,Mr. Weston, much to the discomfiture of Mr. Sampson.  Mr. Sampson covered himself with the next instance.  "The Antiochaus constitute the tenth case. Common  preachers, exiles from Jerusalem, came to Antioch, Phe-  nice and Cypress, and preached ' and a great numbler be- lieved, and-turned unto the Lord.' Here the Word again has the converting power." 'And, remen her too, Mr. Sampson, that the historian says: 'And the Ihand of the Lord was with them.' Now,  I Ihatve contended all the time that the Vord mlay be preached until doomsday, 'but unless thc hainrl of the  Lord is with it-unless God'a Spirit, distinct from it, in-  fluences the heart to accept the Word, it can have lno more effect than it did on the blind Jews. The instance itself tells the tale. When the Psalmist could pray:  'Open thou mine eyes, that I nmav behold  wondrous things out of thy law,' can they need less, whose hearts ! are 'filly set in them to evil?' and they who ' love dark-  ness more thaii light?'. Motives are sufficient to secure obedience of angels, and nman is free, as far as motives  are concerned, but thev are not competent to the task of securing obedience from man, for, he is a fallen and de- praved being, and evil disposed, consequently he who serves God, does it rot through the power of his motives,   &#xD;<pb n="504-505" xml:id="VAC8270-00000255"/> 504       LEANDER ,    . AL. but because He worketh in him to will and to do, of Uis ownz good pleasure. Sir, nota gleaming of aigument for your cause, is to be gained from any of the circumstances of conversions in the Acts. Proceed to the next in routine." Mr. Sampsoni obeyed in a hurry, for lie felt like his de. feat was liaviln effect on all present. At least he did not like the senlsation it created. "Sergiu. Paulus, deputy Governor of Paphos, gives us the tcelfth case. Wlen le san w Paul st'ik E"yas tle sorcerer, blind, and heard Paul preach he believed, being astonisihed at the doctrine of the Lord. Here the power of regeneration is exhibited again in, the Word." "I think y3ou are sadly mistaken. We are told that the Governor believed when he saw'the miracle perfornl- ed. Noiv yoi hlave before slaid that miracles cannot con. vert! Yet inl this case it seems that God chooses them as a source ot impressing the importance of his doctrine, though, had the power of his Spirit been absent, the mira- acles there performed, would have had no more effect, than some of the miracles wrought by Christ, had on the blinded Jews. Now, if the power of God, separate ' from the Word, is not needed, why should David have prayed for his eyes to be opened, so that he might ' be- hold wondrous things' out of the law of God? The hu- man heart is such, tha it cannoc love God or his laws, without a 'change by divine power? John, the Evan- gelist, brings tie ldiffir'nce under this similitude. 'In him, (Christ,) was life'; and the life was the lipoht of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness com- prehended it not.' No wonder that ' Light, which light- eth every man,' was rejected, 'For what fellowship hath righlteousness with uiilrighteousness? and what commu. nion hathl light with darkness?' 1 Cor, vi. 14. Yon may talk about the power of the Spirit being merely in words and arguments, but if the Bible does not teach the operation of the Spirit distinct from the effect of them, then it is impossible for language to convey such an idea. The power Iiglt be attibtted to words and argumnents, had not the Apostle told s at ' Wlomn lie did predes- tinate, themn lie also called: and whom he acalled, them: he also justified: and whom he justified, them le ,aso' go rifled.' Now, the Word, of itself calls every man alike, as far as heard, but every man alike, did not iear   Tt   INV VESTIoATION..      505 it, as the Spirit calls only the elect, according- to .thb  fore-knowledge of God.' Proceed, Mr. Sampson, and  excuse me for this inseemly monopoly/.'  -  "Lydia is the thirteenth case. We are told that she heard the Word and 'attended unto the things of the Lord.' Here we find the power again in the Word." "Thouhll the historian tells us that God opened her hear! If this is not a true instance, (and one that pre-  eludes all cavil too,) of the itnmediatQ operation of the Spirit distinct from the Word, then language could never portray such ilal evellt. It is a pity that you were com- pelled to cite tils thirteenth instance, for it tells all against you. "If it were necessavy for God to open one heart to hear hil Word, then it is-necessary for- lim to open a!l, to make them hear it, as 'There is none right-  eous, no not one; there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.' And as ' the natural  man receivetlh not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.' What more would any one require to prove that the Word lhas no power within itself-that it may be preached, read, heard, written, and meditated on, day and night; but unlss God sends his Sipirit to arrest the sinner, by turn.- ing lIis vile lheart to Him, it will have no more effect than it did on the Jews, whose hearts were ' waxed gross, and their cars dull of hearing,' and who rejected tthe counn sel of the Lord, against the interest of their souls? Tlhe  Word has no effect, only as the Spirit mnakes way for it. :Nor does the Spirit anyltlhing n ore than to open the  heart, or to quicken it from its spiritual deafiess to hear  the Word; that is, renove its Ilindness which prevents  the heart from receiving what the Word speaks, which is the law of God, and lwhich tells the sinner of his error, or converts him from the world, to evangelical belief in God. Go on to the ext, Mr. Sampson."  Wthich is the Philipplian jailor and his family, who heard Paul and believed, and were baptized. This is a  ilain instance."                      : But not gt ainst me at all, my friend, for I have prov- enl by ilnlumerous passages that God operates on the heart distinct fronm the Word; and I have the attestation of -many special. iustances, aud none against me.--Nlow, I  43   &#xD;<pb n="506-507" xml:id="VAC8270-00000256"/> ligve proven that'ifit is necessary"for one1 heart to be opened, :then it is necessary for all, as '.all, ar under si,' and none are rigdtcous. Now the jailor is a case wlich confirms nly position, for he cried ' Sirs, what must I do 'to be saved?' before the Word was preacllcd to him, as we have aiy account of! It shows that his heart was moved before the Word waspreached, and God chose to make miracles the seeming instruments through wxhch he used iis Spirit.. Or, he night halve heard the Word when it was preached to Lydia., but it had .no effect on him, and his conviction, (whch all admit is pre-requis- ite to conversion,) was accomplished after all, by a  i- rect influence of God." Mr. Sampson began to feel that shme hidden nook was a more desirable place tlian the one he occulied. for the thing had gonoedecidedly against him, insomuch ihat some lhad given up all hope. Dr. Booln still retained hs retired seat in the corner, for Mr. Weston was defending the sentimenlts of his heart, without any trouble, so he felt quite easy about the matter. The two lay-menibers of the' Reformation were look- ing very restless-andi tfhouglitful, csleciallv the one from tlhe Baltists, for he was beginlning to thiiik that he had fled firm troubles eudurable, to tlose unendurable, Ife hadlil left the BIaptist Church on account of close-com- munion, bu t he awoke to find himself surrounded by many obstacles, far more repugnant. 'Mr. Samplson's only hope was to proceed at once, t hide his confiloi,1n. :"Dionysius, the Areopagito of Athens, Lady Dam- aria, and others with them, heard Paul, believed, nd clave "nto hint and the Lord. This s tsan indisputable case of hearing and believing, and all from the effect of the Word." "I would ask you one qnestion here, Mr. Samnpson; if all the regenerating power of the Spirit were in words and arguments, why did so many reject Christ ol that occa- sion, for others heard the Word as well as those mentioned as converted, anad heard it with all its power?" Mr. Sampson could make no answer, "Allow me to reply for you," said Mr. Weston, after so long a time. "It was because the Spirit of God did not iufluence their hearts to hear the Word-, in short'b-   4 T1E --1 VE B'SrT-r  S . 5-7T I  ealuso God did not open-ithei hearts. ' T  -carnal minil is enmity against God; for it is not suDject to the law of God, neither indeed can be,' therefore their hearts 'being carnal, they dould not love that which was opposite. Iowever, they were free as far as their own will or mo- tives went, but as I have said before, motives are not strong enough to induce man to serve God, because lie is so depraved, and men's hearts are 'fillly set in thenm to do evil.' Notlhingl can meet tlat stubborn adamaritiuo heart but the Spirit-powcr of God." Preacher Sampnlson admitted the truth of this, by'not  attemlpting a refutation. lie pl;occded.: "COispus, the chief ruler of the Corinthian syna- gogue, and all his ftmnily, hearing Paul, believed on the Lord. The Word is here spokenl of as the power of re- generation, no Spirit distinct, is referred to, in the slig t- est sense." "We do not deny but that belief comes by lhearing, but as it does not in every instance of hearing, we must con- elude that some power separate f'onl the Word, isex-    4 erted on those x hlo hletr land believe, or else, every one0 who hears, would believe.

'The Jews, who lllad retulnedl fi'oml caltivity in B13aD,lo, 'kept thei feast of unlleavlened bread sevenr days wi: joy; for the Lord ad ld made tmcnl joyfull, and turned the Ihart of the kitr q ot Assyria unto them, to strengthen  thleir hlallnds in the work of the house of Godte od of Israel.' Hero is a' remarkable instance of Gol's influculc- im)r the he:rtr of a pangan king, whichh eftect was not of 'words and arguments, nor of inmre motives either. Can yol accountl for tlat?" Th'le pIeachler could o 1t. "Ag ain : 'This Ezra velnt up from Babylon: and he was a ready scrii)e in the law of' Moses, whclh the Lord God of Isr al lhadl givcn : ad the kinrg granteled him all his request, accordlilg to tlic ehand of the Lord ]is God ,nponl Iiml.' Havin g obtained ,a degree of the kinig's favor inl buildinl the temple, he ulttered thse words: 'Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put such a thiln as this, ia the kin#'s heart, to beau:tift the house of the Lord, 'which is in Jerusalemn; iad hatlh ex- cextelnded mercy 'intp me before iho king and his counsellors, and -b)elore all the king's migihty prin- ces.' Ezra recogized the hand of God inllis success, and blessed hinl for the favor instead of the king. Now, I wouild ask you, Mr. Sampson, if tills were the ffect of mere motives, and of ' words al tl alrunlents, or was it the efftect of divine influence on the hieat?" "-The effect of divine influenee on thd heart, I am forced to say/' answered Mr. SamLpon, in a vetry feeble tone. "Again: Here is anotler illustration of the same doc- trine. Nlehenliah had Ihard of the deplorable condition of Jerusalenm,and its inhabitants, and desired to go up and rebuild the city and the temple, therefore, as nelces. sary to gain the king's consent, ie ijriays-' O Lord, I be- seech thee, let now thine car be attentive to the priayer of thy servant, and to the prayers of thy servants, who de- sire to fear thy aname; and prosper, I pray thee, thy ser- vant this day, and grant him mercy il the sight of thia \           - '     '  "  '   man.' Nehemlah pi-ayed to the Lord for the king's fa-. vo', anld not to the king! So the Lord iUfluenced the king's heart, and hs prayer was answered-' And the kinl granted -i, accordiig to the good hand of my God  upo  n'--(Neli. 1, ii; , 8.) What can you say, Mr. Samplson, aainst the passags I have just cited?" S'ot liiiig, onlv they were not cases of regeneration. Now, sir, I woul(i like for you to refer me to instances whee God exerted lany influence besides the Word, in reo- generation."         .  '"But they prove, Mr. Sampson, that God has unlimited sway over the human hleart, outside of words and argu- rumcnts. This yon are bound to acknowledge. If he has, it proves that thepower of his Spirit on whom he regene- rates, is not in wuords and arguments, though they are used as instiruments of coliversion. But to the last re- quest. You want to know of an instance where God has exerted an influence to quicker, the 'dead' sinner, be- sides the effect of the Word. Well, I have but to refer you to Peter, wrhotn Chlrit told that his noble and savigll confession was a special revelation of the Father! And to Lydia ' whose heart the Lord opened, that she attend- cd ulto the thing3s which were spoken of Paul!' And also, I would retfer you to Peter's declaration on the Pen- teoostal da r -' For the promise is unto you, and to your clildren, and to all that are arar off, even as many as the Lord our Godt shall cll.' Will these satisfy you? If not, I will make manly references to like sayings of the Apos-- ties ill tleir epistles to the (Jhurches."'    - Mr,. Samlpson was satisfied, we should think, as he of  fered 110 objection ll "Now " continued- Mr. Weston, " allow me to make the scond( charge against your doctrine: "2. When you say that God cannot influence the heart only through words and arguments, you necessar, ily involve the damnation of all idiots and iiifants dying in infancllyS                      J , Whvy, Mr. Weston, what do you mean?" "I ldil not say that you held with such, but that your dectrine is possessed of such- formidable features as to ne,  cessitate this."  "Explain yourself, sir." jj  &#xD;<pb n="512-513" xml:id="VAC8270-00000259"/> 1        LIArDErItnnALL . "i will. Can you deny the depravity of the human heairt?" "No."'  "Then you admit that infantsarc depraved from birth." "I cannot say, exactly." "But-Iwill prove that they are. 'That whch is born - of the flesh is flesh,'--means, that by the natural Lirth all are depraved, entirely depraved, .ad to be clangied from that corrupt -state, the'individual must be born of tie Spirit. The same doctrine is taught in Gen. viii. 2; :Aiid the Lord smelled a sweet savor, and the I ord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground an y more f r mnali's sake; for (though) thie imagintition of it .s heart is evil from lis youth,'-fr-onm th earliest period of his being. Again: Psa. 5: 5, -'Behold I was shapen in iiquityr anld in sin did my mother conceive me.' Again, Psa.-58: -5 : The wicked are estranged friom the womb; they go. astray as soon as they are born, spealking lies. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent; they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth ler ear; wlhiclh ill not hearkell to the voice of charmers, charniingo nerer so wiselN.' Now these passages prove that infants and all nre depraved. I will cite some that prove the total deplravity of tie heart. 'Jeo'emiah, chap. xvii. 9,: 10: ' Tle heIart is deceitful aove all things, and desperately wicked; who ca n know it? I the Lord search the heart; I try the reils, cvel to Five every man accordinll to llis ways, ald acceorliln to the fruit of his doing.' Again: 'Thereis none riiteous no, not one; there is none-that understandetlh, there is none that seeketh after God. They ar' all golne out of the wiay; they are together beconme Unprfitablle; there is none that doeth good, no, not one, Their throat isan open sepulchre; with their tongues they have usedde- ceit; thepoison of asp is under their lips; whose nlouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and misery :arc in their wavs; and the way of peace have they iot known.. Tiere is no fear of God before their eyes.' The above description doesnot apply to alny particular nation or ge'Ceration, but to both Jew and Gentile, and to every age. Now, sir, I have proven, is you are bound to acknowledge, that infants, adults, and all are depraved, from their n!atural   TIlE INTVE STT-ATIO .       r13 birth. If infants are depravedl, it follows of a necessity that tleir natural state nulst be c!haiged before they can enter heaven, so you must taldnit?' "Yes, I will admit tilat 1mchl " replied the preacherI - trying to get il a imore coumfrttable position. Certainly, Mr. Weston had not selected easy chairs for his parlor, as Mr. Sampson was so restless!  "Then admitting that, you niust also admit tlat some other power, beside 'ods wrd and arngtluments,' Ist ope- rate on their hearts. Init'lts cannot underlstaindl the Word, therefore. the S1,irit tlroughl the Word, cannot convert them, or tit thhet for heavenl. So God ntist cause his Spilit to opelCate inde)pendcetly of ' words ami argu- ments,' or the cilild tli;t dies in iitiancy, is lost! Now, i God makes use of his Spirit without nmeans, (anld I have proven talit he doces,) then the power does not lay in those meHans, (which in tlis case would be ' words and ar- guments,') but Iilll  alone, tlelrefre, lie that is regene- rated, is not quickenled by the Wold, as the (power, but by the Spirit, the Word beiig nrerely an instrumenet (of conversion fronm the sinnldr's former ways.

I will now proceed to ailot!her charge against your doctrine." (Mr. Stampson tloutIt that lho had brought up enough alreatdy.) ' Your doctrine contradicts the doctrine of human de- pravity. If your theory be true, men sin only through r ignorance, and need mere words and argumenlts to sane-  tify and regenerate them, therefore tley are not depraved  as we are told. Only teacthell  t temtetruth, and they will turn and serve God, and go to eIaven. It' this be true, why then do not men serve God as sooi as they    - hear the Word? It men are merely laboring under mis- taken notions about this, then all that is necessary ac- cording to your doctrine, is to correct their mistake!  "Sir, this is contrary to the scriptures.

' Because (not throulgh nis- take, blit willftilly,) sentence a gainst an evil is not execu- tel speedlily, therefore the lhearts of thec sons of men are fully set in thelm to 1lo evil.' ' Yea, also. the learts of the sonst of men are full of evil, and inadiless ill theiri leart whJile they' live, and after thlat they go to the dead' 'The wicked, tihroughi the pride of his countcenancc, will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts.'-Ps. x 4. Thhereception wlhich the Gospel meets with men, is set forth under this parable, by our' Saviour, in which lle say: ' And they all witl onle consent begall to malke cx- clue.'--Luke xiv: 18' Paul accounts for the abominl- tiols of the heathens, tlus: 'And even as they. did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind'.-Rom. i: 28. Then it is nIot for wiant of words' and arguments that lmen are not re- generated, (for they have them ill abundance, aill thley atre good in their place,) but it is because mal,'s?wotlves are not strong etnough to combat with his delpr:.vty,to induce hini to obedience, and because in additio,. lie is: disinclined to do so; in such cases the spirit of God does not influelnce, nor assist tlose motives. (Again : If your doctrine be true, it is unnecessary to pra for the unconverted. Vlhy slould we ask God to con- vict inlners, and then preach to thlen that lie never pro- posed to regenerate a nan, woman or child, by any other power thanl that of words and aarguiments, presented before their minds? If Paul believed ii your doctrine, (and I e certainll did. nbt,) why did he pray for the EphIeslan Christians, that they night be 'strengtlheed .with light in the inner man, by his Spirit "? Paul believed in tihe special agency of the Spirit, or lie would not have nmade that prayer. Why pray at all for God's interposition, if nothiing but arguments are to influence man to servo God?" nI wlill answer you with your own argument," replied Mr. Sampson quickly. -"Because God ias comnmanded us to pray. I asked you why preach if the Spirit does the work, and you answered that because God com- 1manded you, now I make the same reply about prayer." Mr. Sampson thought that Mr. Weston was caught for once, but not so. 4"Yoer answer io not at all appropriate, and I think I t            ^ ' .

Let us 1pralv,' said the minister of God, lifting up his hands in reverence, and bowing humbly at the footof the cross. They bothl knelt, and Mr. Weston offered up heartfelt thanks to tie thlrone of grace, for the great blessing that had been bestowed. IIow vlis soul reveled in gratitude of praise! And was lie alone?  No; Dr. Boon fully joinled in the strain of happy thankfulness.  IHow liftfrently turned out Mr. WeVston's mission from lhat he ladt expected! He had gone thither to endeavorl to console llis disconsolate friend, but when he was met witl such haplpy auspices, his anticipatiQns of sorrow were turned to joy.

That nliglt was spoet in w'resti)ng and prayerand hie day dawned-on lim, findi him still in sorrow. Duties out in the country called his mind from his unhappy feelings somiewhllat, but as the hour approached for him to return to -is lonely ldomlicil, tlis feeling3 of depressions also re- turnled, in double violence. Tired, fatigued, worilo out, both in body and minld, he, upon enltralce of Iris shop, threw hmself despondingly on llis couch, without waiting for supper. In flis state Ihe remained unttil a. few nimomelits lrevious to Mr. Wes- ton's arrival, when he was led to see and feel the glorious liberty of Christ's pardoning love which "casteth out fear;" when he was led to feel that Jesus was his Saviour, and that h died for him. Mr. Weston remained several hours chatting with his new-born friend, on the ricllness of God's grace. Dr. Boon could scarcely keep his seat, for his repentence lad been deep and sorrowf'ul, ald' the sudden transition from dark- ness and trouble, to the glorious light of joy, was more thal lhis excitable terperlment could bear, silently. "But still there is a ciill to my happiness," he remark- ed, r'etlectirely, while the conversation was running in that channel.  "Al n wliat is that?" alsked the preacher solicitously, for lie did net comprehend his friend. "It s, tl:at so many of my fellow men are deluded fa- tally on this point. 'Why should it be?" he asked, half audibly.  "Y u have it in yourpower, my friend, to modify this state of :affairs in some degree." IIow!" lie asked eagel'ly. "By pursuing the course that the house of Stephanus did ." Dr. Boon sprang from his seat at the sugge;stion. "I am not jesting," conltinued Mr. Weston. "If you canl fel that it is your duty in the siglt of God, and that yo) are competent to the task, or will be, with the help of God, then you hazard nothing in engaging -ii the glorious 3work. On the other hand, if -you feel otherwise you cain still lbe a help."'  "How?" he interrupted again.

Mr. Tayloi' was deputized to make investigatioun to the ex- tent of his power, during the days of session, so that, be- fore closing, the recreant preacher might be dealt with. In travelingi through the labyrinth of reports, he was led to Miss Matilda Lankinston, as a source of informa- tion. A call was made, much to her deliglit. "Sister Matilda, I am sent to you for some little infor. mation,. as regardsl this unpleasant afiair of Bro. Su!m- ncr's; what can you say?" he asked, introducing the subject, witliut any ceremony. A crimson hue mantled her check?  Oh, that the thrill could have moved her heart'! "Well, Bro. Taylor, I hardly know what to tell you, [have. hard so many things." "And what did you hear the brother in question say!" he interrupted. 4Oh, I heard him make some hard charges against open communion, and then I heard of some swindling which he was guilty of." ' Can you give me the source?" "I am not-I don't reckon' at least, that I ought to do that, Bro. Taylor. Please don't insist." This answer was given hesitatingly, and Mr. Taylor might have had suspicions, had he been desii'ous, but he was for getting all he could against the younlg preacherl. No- tice, whenl one is startea downward, by tho malignant toigue, friends and all, will give a blow to accelerate the retrograding speed of the unfortunate. Three or folur months ago, Mr. Taylor was pleading for Mr. Sumnler, but now, he was operating against him, and for what? Simply because that he feared lie might join the Baptists in good \ report! Shame on such a man? But to the colloquy. "I will not insist, Sister Matilda, on your giving me the source, if you will only say that you believe the re- port authentic," said Mr. Taylor after a few ioments of reflection. "I bannot doubt it, Bro. Taylor, and the species of swindling was shameful."  "What was it?" "A misrepresentation of property!" Ah,indeed?"   THE INVESTIGATION.        525  "Yes, he resorted to artifice, to make a cCrtain piece of property sell well, but you must lot inllrlicatc nle in this, BIro. Taylor, for I do not vant lmyname to come up in  public." "Thank yon for your information, and rest assured that I will not make mentio:t of you." Mr. Taylor lhad the vliile taken notes of her statc- mcents. He placed them in a small account book as hoe  ended, Ond arose and took his depariture. "'They'll use hin t upi sure, iister Crow," said Miss Lankinston, as that worthy a(1dy stepped in to know wlit t the Elder had been after, beforc lce had hardly gotten out of sight. Mrs. Crow had been watching from her window, and knew that " sometling rrust be up." - '"Use whom up?" "Mr. Sumner."  "Ah?-was that what Bro. Taylor was after?" "Yes, he heard that Il ad hearld Mr. Sunl ner say some- thing against open communion, and he came to make inquiries about it." "Iie did?"                      I "Yes, and I told him. of'some other things which I had heard." "About the swindling I suppose?"  "Yes, Mr. Marcus told it, tlougl he ain't a member of any Church. lie is a trutthful mani I suppose.". "I reckon so. .But did he say what would be done with Mr. Sumner?" "I forgot to ask himn." "What a pity! he would lhave told you, as you gave in so much evidence against him. Oh my! I don't see how  i I can wait until it's all over, to hear the sequel," said Mrs. Crow despondingly. "He'll be turned out of Conference I predict."  "And will join the Baptists."  "Certainly, that's wlhat le is aiming after." "Well, well, I know I don't care a straw, but I did( wish, Miss Matilda, after Annie Bacon left, he wouldl se  to you, for you would make such a good preacher's  wife."

"Your Friend, ".4.TI E. , In a few moments, she put her stationery aside, and went down to the sclhool-room to summon her pupils to their lessons. Wlhen the news of Dr. Boon's conversion reached Mol- lie Westoll's ears, she hardly knew how to credit it, ashe had been to her, such an advocate of baptism for tihe re- mission of sins . Mr. Weston dlid not communlicate the intelligence'to his family. as Dr. Boon had requested him to say nothing about it, though heo himself "told it the   -. LL Ja JL Di, V i 3 - L. a I. V^ a  more." In fact he met with no one whom he excepted, for he could not keep it. His old friends of the Campbel.  lite persuasion, sneered at him, and though he exhorted, them to repentancle, they (adamic like,) laughed him to scorn. But this did not discourage the new convert. Iu spite of their undue levity, aud jeers, he still prayed for them, remembering the blessed promise, that ' Whatso- ever yc ask the Father in my name, he will give it you." A few days afterwards, Dr. Boon called to see Mollie Weston.  "How foolish it was in me," he said, as the conversa- tion naturally turned on that subject, "to gainsay your argument when contending for the ' faith once delivered to the saints. I smliled often at what I thought your false impressions, but when our friends advanced in the investigation of them, I soon found that my doctrine would not do, and I began to shudder at the idea of my  misconception. What if God had suffered me to have died in such erroneous, notions? Oh, how thankful I ought to be, that he has called me from darkness into the marvellous light and liberty of the Gospel." Mollie made no response, for she knew of nothing to say. Dr. Boon continued : "My impressions have always been, that you Baptists advocated the miraculous influence of the Spirit, to such an extent that the person operated on, would be spoken to audilyl, and caused to perform most unaccountable feats, sulch as going .off into hysterics, or fainting, and having the jerks and shakes, which you know were quite prevalent a few years ago." "And which I kniow too Doctor, were never advoca- ted by the Baptists." "No. I know that, but I have always thought that such were your notions."' "May I ask what have you found them really to be?", "Nothing but faith, 'th)e gift of God,' which begets love to God, and ideas of God's love for us, and piety, and love for the brethren, and willingo,obedience to Christ's commanindmients.".' "And nothing-else?"  "Yes, it makes us feel that Christ died for us, that we, personally, have an interest in his blood." "Nothiug else?"                '    ; 45     As   ;  &#xD;<pb n="530-531" xml:id="VAC8270-00000268"/> 58W      L-AH^:EiH SAtL-. .          \ -C(Y, -we are led to see how depraved we are, and how- righteous God is, and how just he would be in destroying uis without mercy." "Notling else?" "Yes, it leads us to see how great a sacrifice our Sa- viour made for us, when he mediated between man and justice." "Nothing else?"  "Yes, we are also led to see, that there is no merit in anything that we can do, but our salvation is of Grace through faith in. Christ Jesus; and it is by his power that e 'see and feel tliis, and by his power that 'we are kept in this. This influence I never felt, when I. submitted to the ordinance of baptism, for I deteirmined to serve God thel by my own power,- but now I trust to serve him only through his power. This is what you Baptists term the miraculous influence of the IIoly Spirit. and it is a mirac- ulous: influence, sure enough ; for man Jeft to his own power, will not entertain such feelings, for his natural in- clination goes against them. Though a mystery aiid a miracle, it cannot be looked on as preternatural; as God promises to all who will serve him." 'I am truly glad, Doctor, that yon arc led to compe- hend the beauty of the Christian faitth, in stch criear terms; for when you used to snllle at my. protestath)ns against your doctrine, I shuddered, though I knew that the natural man could not discern these things, as they really were. ,I often wondered why you shut your ears to all cries against your 'false notions, when to me they were so plain." "I confess, now, Miss Mollie, that I have always had my doubts about our religion, but I never suffered them to intrude on me to any extent, until I found them well- founded. Though I combatted against your views, I could nevei do it in full confidence, yet I understood not why or what sustained you in such a belief, nor could I ever conceive, wherein lay the mystery, or why I could not comprehend, until I heard your fitther quote a text from Paul, the one to whthch you have just referred, then I perceived that it was my blindness in sin that deterred Ile and the. I sought out means to remove that blindness, but I found in the-end that God most do it, and G(od did do it, in his own good time."   TInE r^TiEti r tATfON.      S'31  Mollie listened attentively to the recital, wThichl she kned could come from no one's lips, but lie who had re- illy felt the pardoning love of the Saviour. She Was too  rejoiced to say much, but she felt the more, so spoke her expressive eyes, as they emitted sparks of fire, born of the gushing soul, touched by such happy tiding-s. In ipite of effort, a tear glistened on the drooping lids, and vhich was observed by her friend. Dr. Boon perceiving her interest in the affair, took her iand tenderly and pressed it, before he was aware of what he was doing; and unconsciously le carried it to- lis lips! What a throb it caused in the young girl's jeart! She was hardly glad and yet she w-as not sorry; hough the image of Annie Bacon came up in her mind, o she attributed his visits to the interest he felt in An- ie, and relaxed into'the same silent feeling of regret and ail; determining never to let her love be known, though . cost her the experience of death's struggles.  Dr. Boon sat silent one moment, watching her varying ountenance. "Miss Weston!" She involuntarily started. "Miss Weston!" he called again, in a half dreamy nood. '  At your service, Doctor," she replied, with energy.

"It is reasonable."  "Then out with it," she said, commanding herself tore this time. He drew his chair facing her, and looked into her yes, and in slowly measured tones, asked:  "Did you ever love?"  How her whole frame quivered!

"Wlom?" asked Dr. Boon, eagerly. "I cannot tell you," she replied, still blushin, deeply. "I will now give you my reason," said he "for asking that question." Mollie trembled. Courtships to her, were as ideas dis- tant. She awaited the reason. "It is because I love you, Mollie Weston! and it is be. cause I desire You to love me in return, and me alone; and I wish to know if your heart is fresh, and unsacrificed on the altar of love, for any one else!" This announcement only increased her agitation. Dr. Boon took her hand, and she forgot to withdraw it! He continued: "From the 'irst hour I beheld you, my heart has been at your feet, and that spontaneous love, has grown upon acquaintance. In offering myself, I cannot promise you much, as you know I have determined to espouse the cause of Christ, and calling of your fathter, if the Lord wills it, but I do offer you a heart that truly loves you, and one that has never taken to itself the image of another, so deeply. I have had the contemplation of this event, from the first of bur acquaintance; though previously, I have always imagined insup:erable barriers in the way, lwhich, if they ever existed, are now removed. Say,-now, candidly and decidedly, if you will ainary me, with the prospect which is before ne? Are you willing to ex- change your present happy home, for one with me, whose greatest luxury must be spiritual blessings? You know I cannot expect to become wealthy, or great with my limited talents, but I can earn a competency, like Paul did, by my calling, as to worldly affairs, and as to preach- ing, Ido not pect anything for that, nor would'I have it, if offered me." Mollie -sat silent not knowing what to say, sog great  was her astonishment. "Will you answer mne, Mollie? This way of taking time fir reflection, is all a notion, and a form. Now, you certailnly know whether you can accept this offer or not, il shortl, you know whether you love me or not. Please tell nme without delay," lie pleaded earnestly. Still no answer catle. D1).

A gleam of light shot 'across his heart, but he smoth- ered it. "Speak, Miss Weston, I am prepared for the worst," he commranded, seeing that she hesitated.

The sister had i'eceived a letter for. him, notifying him of his excommunication, but she had prudently put it aside, though she did not dream of its contents. "I have a letter here, Charles, from M--, which I think probably contains some news regarding the Confe- ference, though outside, I have heard nothing." "Then get it quickly-please, sister, and read it to me. It's from Bro. Taylor, I know. He is so kind and consi- derate. I shall always thank him for this act of kind- ness." Mrs. Bernard complied with the request. She broke the seal and read: "' Mu. A. C.

TUE INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUED IN WHCH IS TRACED, TIE RE- REFORMATION FROM ROME OF 1804! AND WHCH IS FOUND TO SYNC1RONIZE WITh THLS PROPhESY: "This know also, that in the last days, perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their onsdlvcs. . . . Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; nHAVING A FORM OF GOD- "NESS, Bur DENYING THE POWER THEREOF; f'om suchl turn away."-II. Tim. iii. 1, 2, 4, 5. NEARLY two weeks had passed since the last convoca- tion of the discussing coterie, and two weeks whichl had been fraught with crowding incidents of painfiul natures. Tongues had been busy with fulsome prognostications, and the result was a plenteous harvest of the consequent fruits. Dr. Boon, anxious that the investigation should be pursued until through with, had beeli idustrious in get- ting the company together again, and now after the lapse of about ten days, they met once more, on Monday even- ing after tea. Preacher Sampson, with his "gold glasses," set con- spicuously on his nose, drew in close proximity to the 'table of books, and picked up a journal of B. W. Stone's life, and began a diligent perusal. Mr. Weston, notchoosing to stand such cool silence, made an interruption. "We have met, gentlemen, to look into the respective histories of our Churches. As we were on the Reform Church last week, I propose that we investigate its histo- ry first. Now, in the meantime, let it be unlderstood that the true Church of Christ, is to be traced back to the days of the Apostles; if neither of ours will go back thither, then neither of ours can be called that Church which undeniably began with John the Baptist's minis. trations, and completed by Christ, in rules and ordinances.' You know, Mr. Weston," said Mr. Sampson, impa.   tiently, " we claim to be the trne order of Clurch. by the Bible, but our lui tstory does not lnate back so fr.'   " "  "Remembelr, Mr. Samnipson, while clainill t!lat. I ]1have proven by Scriptulre testimrlin, t'at ro are not the true Church, nior the true order, cither. We are nowt testing  the Reform Chtrc}t the secon tinme, for exlperimentl. We  have found it lacking, findamentally, ots  otsid of ddi- tionals, now let us see if it is, in the point of hstory."' "-But what rilght have you to contend that the Cjli-rch of Clrist inmlist be traced back to the days of the Apoes- tles?" "Bcctse Chlrist promised that Church, tlnat lie would be with it '..AWAY EVEN UNTO TIE END OF THE WORLD!' that is, if it- nmermbers would teach all things whatsoever  ever he comlmanded.' '"Well, w]hat assiurance hlave yon that its members would obey that command?' "Because Christ declared that the gates of hell sholtl not prevail agqainst his Churclh."  "I don't understand you, Mr. Weston." "will try and explain to you. 'That the gates of hell should not prevail against his Church, was equivalent to the assertion, that'its members would, tlirotugrout all age,  observe to do all thngs he conlmanded, or else how could I the Church maintain its visibility? how could it resist the gates of hell to the perfectffulfillment of Clhrist's declara- ation? He first declared to Peter, that lih wolldl build up  his Church, and tlat the gates of hell siouldl notjrevail  against it. After its completion in rules and re1gulations, he takes his departure, and commlands lis Apostles to 'Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, b1iptizi i'l them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things wliatso- ever I have commanded yonlf 1 , nd, lo, I ant witlh vol, ALWAY,EVEN UNTO THE END OF TIiE W\      RLD' :,' Here are the promises to the Church, andfrim, n f Nl \!j! we must inevitably coclude that that Chuircl- 1I;ns ever!been, visible, since its first visibility, thongh perseccutedl 111 every age.

If the Refi)rmed Church .(so called) canlnot be traced back to the first days of the Church, as given us by the Apostles, thlle it has no right to claim to be the true Church, no more so, than any other religious society that makes no such Ireten- tions." "I suppose then, you'll make the Baptist Church, that Church, whether or not," said Ir. Sampson, with a. sneer. "No, sir; if we fail to trace the 3Baptist Church back. to the days of the Apostles, then we will aeklowledge that it is not the Church of God, againsst lwhich, Christ declared that the gates of hell should not prevail." r Tlen proceed," saidl Mr. Samnpson, imrpatiently. "Wit the history of your Church?" "Yes; as you like," -was the gruff reply. "If I should make a stateenlt, that is not correct, which I will lnot do intentionally, you must contradict it, Mr. Sampson, and defend your Church." "I will; go on." "The first notice we have of a Reform, or Cllristian Church (so called) on the record- of' history," began Mr. Weston  , is, hen Barton W. Stone and liis coadjutors withdrew from the Presbyterian Synod in 1804. This new issue went under the name of Reformation. There had been, some charges preferred agaitlst a portion of the' number who seceded, from this body, which aroused a spirit of fanaticism, and you must admit, Mr. Sampson, of all doctrines taught siune the first rise of the Pope, the' nmost inconsistent, and fanatical, were propogated in that day by these Reformers." "I know, Mr. Weston, that the Reformers, when first visible, were very fanatical in some of their doctrines." "Yes, and that body of seceders declared that no where on earth did the Church exist, nor had existed, since the great apostacy! Making an aggregate of over sixteen centuries, the total extinction of the Church! though Christ pro- mised that the gates of hell should not prevail against it! They renounced all creeds, but still a thousand inconsis- tent creeds were advocated by them. They claimed to be the true and only Church of God, and yet they had never been baptized! I This, Mr. Sampson, you .know is true ol these Reformers." 7    .. :Tes, but they did not hold to that, doctrine always, 'r Ftleyg'raduilry reformed in error until they became  'followers of the Bible, alone." "You have not proven that by the Bible. But let us look at the first instance of baptism; 'or rather let us trace these Reformers for a time previously. B. W. Stone was' a great revivalist, and what you call now-a-day, an error- ist. He was engaged in those camp-meetings where the jerks and shakes became so prevalent, and lie cicouuraged 'uch extravagances in a glreat deogree. As w-e have before Istated, he, with his other disciles, , witdrew f'rom the Presbyterian Synod, in 1804, and frnied a new issue called the 'Springfield Presbytery. At lengtlh, 1. W. Stonel began to dou)t the doctrineof- this New- Lightismn-this Spirit-power of convulsions, but sqme little circumistances transpired afterwards which re-assured hm. and he went on in full confidence, propagatiing this doctrille. "It will be remembered, that these New Lights, or, as they were called by themselves, Christians, 'renounced all human creeds, and professed to take the Bible for their guide alone. This gave popularity to their nlame, and Stone says: 'The Churches and preachers grew and multiplied. We began to be puffed up at our prosperity. But this pride of ours was soon humbled by a very ex- traordinary incident. Three missionary Shakers, from the East, came amongst us--Bates, Mi tcharm, and Young. They informed us that they had heard of us in the East, ,and greatly rejoiced at the work of God amongst us, and thus far we were right, but we had not gone far enoughI in the Work.'-(Life of -tone, p. 62.)  "Now, remembersthat here are a people, who profess to be the Church of God, and yet not baptized! The Shakers scented them from afar, and saw that one more step and these New Light would be in their hands! At  this time, the points of differences between the two sects were but slight. " Purviance, one of the seceders, writes: 'In the midgt of our trial with Shakerism, some of us becanme con- vinced that infant baptism was not in the Bible. We were cautious in speaking on the sulbject.

Iowever, we rested quietly till 1807.' (Purviance and B. W. Stone, p. i27;, s quoted foro th. Curl. ef.) "These Reforners-tlese anti-creedl men-tlese men who took thheBible for their sole guide,llad to be 'cau- tiols' about their error! That, was the characteristic spirit of thegreat Reformers of the beginning of the nineteenth century! Cautious in speaking aga, ist error! and yet they had pronounced the whlole phalanx of Churches o' Christendom, as apostates from-the true Church! Such bravery is unparalleled! Ah me, if the poor persecuted Baptists-through the dark ages of tleir history-if they lhad been cautious inl renouncing infant blaptism, how much blood would lave been spared? But lere is a class of men who are vowed to declare the whole consel of God, that spoke cautiously against what they know tobe error! Fearless Reformers! Chlristians, pro- fessedly of the primitivestripe! and vet feared the conse- quences of exposing error! Did the Apostles do this? Have the Baptists of any age pursued this course?" "You ki;ow, Mr. Weston, that the Church soon came out of that. We are as much opposed to infant baptism as you Ba3ptists are." "I know it, Mr.'Sampsoi, but I am calling up your history, now. We both agree that infant baptism never was a feature of Christ's Churcll! Still we find it in yours, in its earliest days! or in'the Reform Church which first proclaimed, your fundamental doctrine-Baptism for the remission of sins. Now this is proof against the the identity of your Church with the one which Christ declared the gates of hell should not prevail against." Mr. Sampson began to run his fingers through his hair as usual, when perplexed, but did not interrupt the pre- vailing silence. Mr. Weston continued: "We are now brought to the first instance of baptism, in this Reform. Hear the record given. "In 1807, a young woman, -who professed faith in Christ and joined the Church, applied to Stone for im. mersion. "In pursuance of whichl he published a meeting at a certain water, on aday future. At the time and place ap- pointed a large congregation assembled. Reuben Dooly.   THE INVESTIGATION.        641' preached, and afterwards Stone immersed the young wo-. mnal, and one or two more. I had not thought of being baptized on that day when I went to the Ilace; but du- ing the exercises of the day I realized that it is a com- mand of (od, and I am bound to obey. (A strange Cburch!!) I called Stone and Dooly aside, and made - known my mind to them, and asked Stone to baptize me, to which he consented. I remarked to them that the way of duty appeared plain, but I was sorry to lhurt the feelings of the brethren. Dooly said the best way to please brethren is to please the Lord. I tlen addressed the congregation publicly. It was the first tine the subject had been publicly named amongst us. We went to the water; betore we went in, Dooiy said to me quietly,' As foon as you are baptized, I shall want you to put me uiF- der the water.' Accordingly, as soon as I was on my feet, Dooly came forward, and a number more followed, whom I baptized before I came up out of the water. Stone was not baptized on that day. None of us urged the matter.' (Purviance and B. W. S., p. 127.) "This is a miniature view of the Christian Church (so called) in its third year, and here we find that it lacks over sixteen hundred years of being old enough to be identified with the Church of Christ. We are told that the kingdom of Christ (his Church,) was set up in the days of the CSesars, which would carry us back prior to the birth of this Church, over sixteen centurics, so ac- cording to clironology, it is not the Church of Christ. But to the subject. "The above quotation from Purviance and B. W. Stone, presents clearly the features of a Church, (!) which. declared that all denominations were 'off of theJoundation of Apostles and prophets,' and they alolne on it! But at this juncture, or shortly afterwards, anotler all-imposing standard was raised--Baptism for the remission of sins! "Not that it was thought of, and led to the immersion of the Reformers, but it like many' of the rules of the Wesleyan society, was suggested by mner chance! Tlhe members converted during the revival which. swept over the State of Kentucky about that time, says Stone, ' will be known in eternity.'

If that great number converted in such a miraculous manner-if they Were saved before the institution of baptism for the re- mission of sins, was puut up, hov (if the new-born scheme of salvation be true) coiuld they have been saved? Are there two modes of salvation? Did Mr. Stone ever rec- oncile this glarliing inconsistency? "But hear the origin of that new scheme. 'I remem- ber olne,' says Stone, 'about this time. mourners were invited every day to collect before the stand in order for prayers, this being the custom. The brethren were pray- ing daily for the' same people, and -some seemed to be comforted. I was' considering in my mind what could be the cause. The words of Peter at Pentecost rolled throulh my mind,' Repent and be baptized for the re- mission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.' I thought were Peter here, he would thus ad. dress the mourners. I quickly arose and addressed them in the same language, and urged them to comply.' "Wondrous discovery! It rolled through the mind suddenly as if by inspiration. A new plan of salvation! Sixteen centuries had pass'ed oblivious of its true virtue! Oh, those dark ages! why need suffer the martyred Wal- densians, and their cotemporaries, when all their piety and devout worship availed nothing unless baptized for tke remission of sins?!!-unless this remodled motto of Catholicism were adopted?!! Surely, if this new scheme be true, Christ has not fulfilled his promise,--'UPON THS ROCK I WILL BUILD MY CHURcH, AND THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST IT.' But we have discussed this point, so let us cling to history. "Since we have found a body, who called themselves Christians, and who adopted the plea-'Baptism for the remission of sins '-let us investigate the design of this new issue. Was it because of persecutions? No! Was itt for anything, but REFOaRMATION?! ETo; for the very word instils a spirit of fascination to its subjects.

Yes, some have dared re- forn thie Church of God! Its laws, founded by eternal  wisdom, have been trampled under foot, and Reformation has stepped in, and made innovations under this garb of sheep's clothing! All, what an insult to the faithfulness of her Husband and King! "Presbyterianism is a reformation itself! Of what? The Ronman Catholic Church!' What are the records of super-ecclesiastical history, but the details of religious blasphemy, and superstitious persecutions, of priestly am- bition, and strife, of pious and sacriligious frauds, of anti christians pretentious, and vile usurpations of grasping and merciless power, whose devastating march of abom- inations. lias been over the prostrated rights of mankind,' expiring from the woe issuing from the. Executive head, leaving the panorama darkened by the thickened scenes of gore, gushing from the life-tide of innocence, welter- ing in innlocett blood?!! A CATHOLIC ChnITRCIr EFORMED! What more is Protestantism? Is the Church of Christ, wlhose 'kingdom is not of this world,' is it come out of  this monster of iniquity, tlis 'mother of harlots, and; abominations of the earth'? Presbyterianism was born in the gates of Babylon!-and consequently is the daugh- ter of that 'mother'! Are we to look for the Church of  Christ to be reformed- fom hence? No!

"Among the offhoots of Presbyterianism-these re- formers of reformers, history places thi Current Reforma- tion!-dating back to the beginning of the nineteenth century, )by nearly eiglteen centuries too young to be idctitied with the Church of Christ.

But let us trace otlher confluent sources of this great Current Reformation. The new scheme was scented afar off; and in due time the gi- gantic strength of Alexander Campbell was given the cause. He, the giant of Virginia, became dissatisfied about tills time with the Presbyterian Church, and joined the Baptist, but never was satisfied until about eighteen years afterwards, we find him l'rifted in the Current Reformation ;'that is, embracing its popular doctrine, in conjunction with B. W'. Stone and others."(See Cur. Ref. by S. HI. Ford.) "t Why I thouglt, Mr. Weston, that 'baptism forthe remission of sins,' originated with Mr. Campbell," inter rupted Dr. Boon" "No; in its present ultimatum form, it was first propa- gated by the Springofield Synod, in eighteen and seven, as conceived of by 13. W. Stolle! alnd with which, says he, the Clristian2 Clhurc (so called.) beqan?-and from which he dates the rise of the Current 1Rfformation of the ninetcenth century.!

W. Stone. It is useless for me to detail the trials of the Baptist Church, at this junc- ture. Thousands who never were Baptists indeed, drift- e. d along this popular stream, and enmbraced readily, this abomination of Rome-this schleme, 'baptism for the re mission of sins,' whichl has relared a society that has the form of God/l/iss, but denics the poteir thereof, and from such we are tod to turn away!

"There ap-  pears to be a striking resemblance in the fornmation of the Retorm Church, and that of the Methodist. Bothl seem to be of a happen-so olgii,. And. tlough .protfs-  sedly Reformers, they have enbi'aced creeds equally crrto- neous, as those renounced." "Just so," replicl Mr. Weston. "This is one of the features of man's power, Iisjudgrment is not unerrincg, therefore, it is impossible for him to fiorm a gover'lenllt of a Church, or any other Society, that is unexcepllion- able.

W6st6O1 con- eluded, alnd the lay-brethren cast an inlploring look at-  him, but to no purpose, for the truth had been declared and he could not gainisay it. Mr. Weston took up the theme again. "Our Saviour told his Apostles that hs Churcl was built upon a Roc;, against which the gates of hell should not prcoail ;meaniilg evidently that it should statnd ulshai- ken throulgh successive ages, though the Devil and his emissaries, should colleague to exterminate it. Aft'eil- wards, throughl inspiration, he told ot its persecutions- that it would be compelled to fly for succor into the wil-  derness, but even there it was to be nourished by theo same strength; yet nowhere, is it spoken of, as being tri-  umphed over by oppressive powers. "We also are told, that 'Christ died for the Church, that he gave himself for it, so that at. his second appear- nlg, it might be presented to him as a bride, without spot or blemish, and arrayed in clean, and fine linen, which are emblems of purity. To this Church, he ppromises his pro- tection, insomuch that the gates of hell are to fail in combattiug for its extinction, as he will be with it alway,  even unto the end of the world'! So it has never beenl pro- sented in any form, but the idea of its continual visibility "  &#xD;<pb n="546-547" xml:id="VAC8270-00000276"/> "       LBEANDTER hALL. is conveyed. Ilndeed, it is as the 'strong man's house, fortifled agailst its cenmie3s )y Christ himself, who van- quishedi the foe, whle lie exclaimed: 'Get thee hence S taII, for it is written, thlo shalt worship the Lord thy God. and hinm only sialt thiou serve.' Henlce, we concluide tliat it las been visible at all ages since its first .rigilm, visibiy; if. not, Christ has not kept his word. We know tliat he has, and we believe that lhis Church, though per- secnted'and martyred in a thousand ways, hias ever been visible--has ever had witnesses of the primitive order of tilings. In tils we lhave fotilun your Church lacking, Mr. Sampson, for yours has existed only about half a century, while Cli'ist's, over eighteen; therefore, outside of fund atmental principles, your church is short in the balances." Oh, I did not expect for you to trace us back to the Apostles, for the Pope destroyed the primitive order of things before the close of the sixth century," said the veritable preacher, endeavoriing to cover his discomfiture by this device. "Do you believe that he did, completely?" "Certainly, certainly. You know how near the Church becanme extinlct at one time." "I know, but that does not signify that every knee bowed to that Baal. God has at all times reserved a rem- nant to worship him, and he will continue to do it. Now if you believe that, what can you make of Christ's saying to Peter?" 'Mr. Sampson did not know. Mr. Weston proceeded.  "The dispairity of age prevents the union or identity of Church, if nothing else. But this is not all. We looked into -its doctrine and found it lacking in two vital points. In the onset of this discussion, we all unitedly concluded that the Lord's Supper was given to the visible Church-those whom it was given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whom Christ left, as the rep- resentatives of the kingdom, while he was absent; and the observance of this ordinance was to shew forth his death,. until he should come again, and take possession in, person of that kingdom. To thils we all agreed. "Theln, as we founld the Supper belonging to the church alone, we all agreed also that there was but one ,^ .

This we have done, and as I have been the opponent. of all your doe- trinles, and that successfully, then the Baptist Church, the ! Cllurch which I have cspo'ised, must be the only trle  thullrchl, for 'neither -of you could' refute its doctrines,  though conibincd attacks were made. Yet, though the Bible i. for us as to orthodoxy, and as all have under- gone an examilnation, in a historical point of vietw,.tid n failed, I an willing now to trace our history, though it mus t be done thronugh fields of blood.  "B1ut to tie cucharist. We found. it a Church ordi- nance, we agreed that there was, and is but one Clhurch, mand to it alone the Lord's Supper belongs; we fotnd also, that the Methodist was not that Church, anld there- for we cannot affiliat withl it as such. Upon furtler investi ation, we lave found that the Reform was not that Church, consequently, we cannot comniune with it, for \ve are told to ' mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to thi doctrine which ye have learned;  and avoid thenl!' Also, if we recognize such, it is  equivalent, to bidding God-speed to error, and 'he that biddethl him (the errorist,) God-speed, is partaker of his evil (eeds!' Sir, we caunot,' conscientiously coninune with tilose who propagate error, for it would be bidding the errorist God-speed, and we would be the same as par- Iaking of this evil, for all error of any kind is evil-no  goo(d call collme of it." "I thonghllt that baaptism was always your plea for close communion," said Mr. Semms. '.Baptism is a mark by which the visible Church is determined, but baptism that is not administered scriptn-  ally, is not valid baptism. Nor would we commune with a baptized believer, which was, once of our denomi- nationl, and had been excluded, for we are told, not to do it. ' Now I comnand you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeous Christ, thlat ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderlyl.'-2d Thess. iii: 6.

"The Apostle James gives us a talisman, by which we are to be guided in that matter. 'Shew me thy faith witho ut thv works, and In-ill shew thee my faitlh by my works.' Meallning evidently, that men's works, tell what they arc. We try the members by their works, if they are disorderly and guilty of the sins which tlose who walk in the flesh are, theue they are in the flesl, lnot in the Spirit, therefore, we must withdraw ourselves from them. We all know the fruits of the flesh, and can easily judge/ This is the way to 'try the Spirits,' to see whether they are good or not." "I see, I see, you will have your own way about it nanylhow," said Mr. Sampson, impatiently. "It's no use o try to convince you of the great error of close com- munion." "That's unfair Mr. Sampson. Now let me ask you a few questions, and I think you will admit that it is." "Ask as many as you iwish,"' lie replied petulently. Mr. Weston took no notice of h is tolc. "Do you believe that the Lord's Supper belongs to the Church, or to any and all classes that may choose to ob- serve it?" "It certainly belongs to the Church of God, and to it alone. Indeed it is an ordinance of the Church, and tone but the Church-has a righlt to observe it. But who ever disputed that fact, Mr. Weston?" "No one; I am trying to bring you to a point of ac- knowledging the unfiirness of your charge. Now, I ask you, candidly, Mr. Sampson, whether you Helieve that it belongs to that Church, whose history we have during the apostolic days, or to any and every class and sect of the world?" Of course it belongs to the Church of Christ, for he gave the ordinance to his Church, alone." "Very good, Mr. Sampson. You do not believe in a plurality of Churches, on earth." "  o; no one believes that Christ ever set up but one Church on earth."' "Very well; now tell me, Mr. Sampson, when that Church was first' made visible?" "We differ, Mr. Weston, as to the exact time. You  contend that it was before Pentecost, and I, that it was first :isible on the day of Pentecost; but so that you may   THN' Iv ESti  TO  T a T .    549 have an answer, I will sa5, that it was first visible in the days of the Caesars.' .  Is it ever represented as being triumphed over at any period?" "No; Christ said that the gales of hell sh9ltld not prevail against it, and we are told thlt it is to be perseccted, ilas- much, that it is to bedriven into the wilderness, but even there it is to be nourished." "Then, according to that, Mr. Sampson, it mnst have been visible since the days of its first visibility!" 'O 1, it was to apostatize!" lie exclaimed, seeing the trap into wtlichl, he was lab)out to get. "Mr. Sampsol0n!-tihe Church of Christ, the bride, the Lamb's witf to apostatize?

Mr. Sampson began to wish that he had remained si- lent. Mr. Weston continued:' "Since you have acknowledged thatthe Lord's Supper belongs to the Church of Christ, tand that there is but one Church, and since you cannot prove that that Church was ever to become extinct, then you cannot prove that the Reform Church is the true Church, for it was set up within the scope of tie recollections of many now living, and you say Christ's Church was set up in the days of the Caesars! iNow, am I unltair in saying that you nave no legal right to the Lord's Supper, and that I cannot commune with you because you h  ott?"  Mr. Sampson only looked grum, and made no reply. Mr. Weston continued: "We are told that Babylon is the 'Mother of Harlots and abominations of the earth.' All agree, that Babylon, here spoken of, means the Church of Rome! Well, if she is thie mother of harlots, those harlots must be her children! Now, tell me, Mr. Sampson, who are hcr lefgitimate offspring?"  "Why, the Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Methodist Churches, and other Churches of those classes, of course: they arc the reformed offsprig of her body."   &#xD;<pb n="550-551" xml:id="VAC8270-00000278"/> / SS5-A lsoe-A-X i-    g 4T 4 "o The Methodist being a grand-daughter by lineal de' scent?"

An- swer, will you, Mr. Samrpson?" "I suPlpose it means that the Roman Catholic Church, is the mother of all unscriptural sects, and errors of thre world." "Y 6ou are correct, Mr. Sampson, according to my judg- ment. Now, I want to tell you that the idea of bapts tism, for the remission of sins, did not originate outside of the gates of Babylon. No, long before Barton Stone was dreampt of, this efficacy was given to water, and this idea was born anmidst the s-perstitious Sacramentaries of the Roman Catholic Church, as originated from the plea of infant baptism, and was transferred to the Reform. Church of 1804, it being by natural descent, the grand-daughter of Rome, alnd of course, one of the 'harlots' of whom, / Babylon is the mother! You need not start at this idea, Mr. Sampson. Your Reform Church is by descent, a re- reftrmed d aughter of Rome! The Church of Christ was werer to be reformed from Baby)lon! No!

Tl'rotighi the dark ages  of the middle centuries, whose twilight shads arc sctarce- Vly lenet'rale by imparitial history, iblurred with perlsecl-  tils, at train of trun fiollowers of the meek and lowly, Jesus is to be seen as struggling againstg the thlen prevail- ing tide of corruption, and battling il patience and fortitude, with its enemies.

'If we have time, I would like very much to hear it," said Dr. Boon, rising fronm nis seat and approaching the  talle. Preacher Sampson glanced at his watch quickly, and said: "We have not time. It is now half past nine. We will hardly get started before it will be time for us to break up." "Then we will have to defer it," yielded the Doctor. "Yes, some other :eriod will do as well." "Say to-morrow  evening," suggested Mr. Weston. "No," replied fMr. Sampson hastily," I have to leave town to-morrow." "Then the next evening?" "Not then either. I sl all be gone all the week." "Then when will you be back?" 'asked Dr. Boon, be- coming sonmewhat annoyed by, the disappointment. iI .dol't think I can meet you again before next week." "No sooner than that?" "No; business calls me off." "And you are rot sorry," thought Dr. Boon.  "When we meet again," said Mr. Weston, "let us make it our business to trace the Baptist Church, and learn of iti history: If it is defective in that point, then it is not the Church of Christ, for Christ has said the gates of hell should not prevail against it, and we must, conclude that it lhas ever been visible.

Mr. Sampson pleaded earnestly against it. "People will think you crazy, Doctor, and many will laugh at you. The idea! Why,youhave been baptized, what more can you wish? Would you be baptized over?   JL J JI A i a p J J F a I v A * -a m Preposterous, Doctor! preposterous! What more can you ask than one baptism?" "I want to be identified with the true followers of Jesus, Mr. Sampson. I want to be placed where I can feel like I have a legal right to partake of the Lord's Supper." ("Fiddlesticks! it's all a humbug. That's some of Wes- ton's notions." "No, no; do not look on it so lightly! To me it seems a matter of vast magnitude." "But so you get to heaven, where's the philosophy of such foolish doctrine?" he asked impatiently. "We should not serve God, Mr. Sampson, merely be- cause we fear him, but because we love him. Christian love begets obedience. God has a purpose in having a visible Ciurch on earth, and we have no right to gainsay his object. I do not believe that any Christian, can wil- fully neglect this duty. When the heart is made to love God, it's first inquiry is after hiis laws, so that it may obey them." "Admitting all that, have you not obeyed the com- mandments? You have been baptized scripturally, now what more can be required?" "I beg leave to differ with you. After the coming of our Saviour, and after his death and resurrection, and even ascension, we are told that certain disciples at Ephe- sus were baptized into the faith of his coming; now that baptism, of improper motives, was 'hot counted as valid, because Christ had come and had fulfilled the law, and had ascended. Neither is my baptism scriptural, because I was not baptized with a proper design, nor were I a fit  subject for baptism any more than the believing sorcerer, who, as Peter tells, was 'yet in the gall of bitterness, and the bond of iniquity,' though he had been baptized. No, Mr. Sampson, I have not been baptized, scripturally. When I was baptized, I did not declare my ' death to sin,'  which is one of its objects. I was baptized in order to re- mission of sins, which experiment, had no effect. I must leave you, let the consequences be what they may." -  "Tut, tut, tut, I had better hope of you, Doctor.

Mr. Sampson did not know what reply to make, so he remained silent. At that moment, the broad disc of the moon, rose above the tree tops, giving a soft and very useful light; but it attracted no attention from either Mr. Sampson, or Dr. Boon, for they were intent on their thoughts. The former at length spoke. "Do not -be hasty, Doctor, in your conclusions. In time you may learn to look on these impressions as very ridicuilous. I tell you, it is all a humbug, after all." I cannot think it, Mr. Sampson, for I 'know that my Redeemer liveth.' Since this change, I do not feel as I did before, Every thing appears to me now, the provi- dential workings of God." "It's all the result, Doctor, of your suffering y&amp;orself to become exercised, and your relief is but the effects of wear- ing out the bitter feelings of your heart." "You cannot philosophize me into that notion, at all, Mr. Sampson. "I have never experienced such feelings, as I do now. When I was baptized, 1 felt tolerably com- fortable, but that was only the effect of your arguments on me. To-day I find myself able to rejoice, even amidst any trial which my Lord may suffer to be inflicted. Be- fore, I was dreading every shadow, and never suffered one spark of genuine thankfulness to exist in my heart to. God, for his manifold blessings; but now my whole heart is thankful, and I feel a cause to rejoice. You cannot cheat me out of this blessing, though you may turn the universal system into metaphysics. I know that I have passed from death unto life,' because I love God's people, and because I love God. Before this feeling of love, my energy in our cause was but the result of pride and am- bition, now, I feel like working for my Master's "cause, because I love him, and I feel for my fellow man." Mr. Sampson did not make any comment for come time, for it had set him to thinking. They walked on slowly for a time, but the silence be- gan to appear rather embarrassing, so the preacher thought, for he was the first to interrupt. ' I'tell you my candid belief, Doctor, this strange and fanatical religion is doing more against the cause of Christ, than all the works of Tom Paine or Voltaire put  .   THE INVESTIGATION.        655 together. It is error from the beginning. We are told to believe and be baptized for the remission of sins; if we try to do more, we insult God." "What are your ideas Mr. Sampson, about repent- ance?" asked the Doctor, interrupting the train. "Oh by repentance, it means that we. must just turn  away from sin, and obey." "But you know-'Man in the pride of his counte- nance will not seek God;' now what can you make of that?" "Nothing, nothing, only men are too proud to obey, sometimes."  "I cannot think that is the proper meaning. I believe that pride is the depravity, the sinfulness of the heart, which in that state, cannot love God, because he is so pure and wholly antagonistic to the powerless motives of deceitful human nature. Furthermore, I believe the re- pentance spoken of in the Bible, means heart-felt sorrow." "Oh tut, tut, tut, how simple! Why, when I see any  one weeping under my preaching, I just think he or she has mistaken me. This heart-felt sorrow, or 'sincere re- repentance, (as some folks term it,) is all a humbug. Why what have we to repent in this way for? Yes, I say, and believe, that all this weeping and mourning of penitents, is a down-right humbug!" sounded out the preacher, again, in a peering tone. "You are mistaken Mr. Sampson. My own feelings attest that such must be the sinner's condition before God pardons him. Yes he must feel lost, wretched, afid miserable before he can feel willing to trust God. Hear what the Bible says on that point: 'Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts ye double- minded. Be afflicted and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heavi- ness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.'-James iv: 8-10. What more evi- dence is needed to establish my views? I say, and be- lieve, that the sinner must repent deeply before God will pardon him?" Mr. Sampson did not know what to say to that passage. He was puzzled. After this, they walked on in silence until they reached  the Doctor's office.   &#xD;<pb n="556-557" xml:id="VAC8270-00000281"/> 656       LEAN DER HALL. The preacher was invited to stop, but he prudently de clined, for he had heard enough of Dr. Boon's views which proved to be well authenticated.  Slowly the proud moon advanced to the eastern hori zon, defying the fragments of floatingincense, that dared to obtrude on her light. And even the milky-way with its unbroken galaxy, was overshadowed by the lustrous beams of this fair queen. It was a clear, dry, cold and still night. Preacher Sampson muttered to himself many unpleasant sentences, as he strqde his way homeward. Things had not turned out as he had expected. Once he was led to exclaimn             ' "'Man proposes; God disposes.' " But he was not a great believer in the Providences of God, so, no sooner had the expression escaped his lips, than he hushed the sound thereof in his ear, but in his heart he could not. The preacher was fretted, annoyed, perplexed, grieved. annoutdlone by the course which Dr. Boon was pursuing. Just at the time he was most needed to the cause, he was going to fly the track! Mr. Johnson was coming to M-- soon, to hold a protracted meeting with Mr. Sampson. The Church wanted to be built up. It was indeed in a deplorable condition, and the protracted meeting was the only hope. Dr. Boon leaving just at that moment, would have a dreadful influence. "If we ould only get him to shut his mouth,- we could stand the other," the preacher would mutter,as the thought pressed him hard. "But these everlasting babblinl Baptists," he continued, "there is ntio stopiug their tongue. Let them take a notion that they have been operated on by the Holy Spirit, and you had just as well try to convincethem that white is black, as to try to beat any sense in their heads." So you had, Mr. Sampson, for a child born of God can never be robbed of that birthright, by all the philos- (phy and metaphysics in creation. Those who think they have, and have turned away, are those who "wentout from us, but they were not of us; or if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out that they' might be made manifest, that they were not all of us."-- John ii: 19.

IT seems that the two Churches at M---, which rested securely in open communion, were but awaiting the fu- ture events of disturbing commotions. The Methodist Church was brought to trial, and lost one of its best mem- bers, over which it lamented bitterly, and now the Re- form Church was hauled in tow, and a struggle, hard and long, was the consequence, and it met with a similar fate. On Saturday preceding Mr. Weston's day in M -, Dr. Boon united with the Baptist Church, and was ap- proved for baptism. He was called on by the Church, to relate the circumstances of the great change, wrought on his heart. He did so, in clear and distinct tones, de- fying all unfair jeering, or sport, which the spectators from other denominations might choose to make. Some did laugh at what they termed "his weakness," but it was a brave deed, and in spite of prejudice, it called  forth admiration and esteem from many other hearts. It caused the masses of the Reform Society to leave the Church, asking themselves, "Are we right? May we not be mistaken?" Sabbath morning dawned. It was a very pretty day -every way, only it was quite cool. A large concourse of people gathered on the water's edge long before the hour for baptism had arrived, for all were anxious to get a po- sition where they coud see a man redipped! and sonme even, to mark the indecency!--of what our Saviour him- self submitted to'!

The hour arrived. Dr. Boon was promptly in atten- dance. Mr. Weston opened the exercises by offering up an humble prayer, and then a hymn was sung, and lo! as when the man from the wilderness, baptized in Jordan, Dr. Boon was baptized! Beneath the liquid waves, he was buried, avowing his " death to sin." The effect of that scene told itself in after days. It will yet linger in the memory of many, until they are called to their long homes. Dr. Boon did not stop here with his influence. His old associates, whom he knew to be in error in regard to this vital point, he sought often, and exhorted them to re- pentance. Some heeded, while others smiled at (what they termed) his simplicity. But none could' withstand his scorching denunciations of error, without resorting to low devices, such as insinuating sneers, and sallies of quibbling wit. The dark, heavy clouds of winter hung gloomily over the crown of LeanderH-all, and ever and anon a hardy drizzling would set in, which made the weather exceed- ingly unpleasant. A distant roar of mumbling thunder was now and then heard, above the noises of the more silent nature. The Ohio, muddy and swolen from the re- cent rains, curled her way downward, while her surface was ruffled by the fluctuating winds, and the dashing spray of the nimber clouds, above. Old Mr. Bacon sat in his lonely sanctuary, in gloomy *and morose thought. Unchanged, by time, the s lnie cloud of anger hovered over his brow. Grief had not softened his heart one particle. That same resolute look of revenge was settled in frightful features, on the index of his inner man.. But he was passing from earth! Yes, his step was slower and more feeble, and his hand had become more palsied. He was passing from earth, and leaving a banished daughter unreclaimed!-his only child! He was doing this consciously,! A servant boy entered the room. The old man drew from beneath the lids of a book, a note, hardly written in a legible hand, and handed it to him, and gave further orders, and the boy left. j(.   In the course of an hour the boy entered with. Mr. Ba- con's lawyer! A will was to be made!  Ah, how much we hang on the few moments of hesi- tation, as he sits reflecting on the best course.  The lawyer sits with pen in hond, freshy dipped in ink, and his left hand resting on the folio of foolscap, ready to record, perhaps, something more direful than a death-warrant!  The old man thinks! reflects! and at the lapse of five minutes, he concludes to defer it! Great is the sorrow  that decision forestalls!                 ] The lawyer returned to his office, somewhat fretted, but it had better have been as it was, than a life-time of regret to another. His fee was lost, but by it a contribu- tion was made to the happiness of another. A peep at Miss Lankinston, and we will leave M--- for the present.

The reader will remember that her object, partially, in joining the Church, was to gain his favor, and to help him out after being worsted in the discussion, but other events caused her to change her programme, over which she- set herself to work, and soon the wires had been successfully used, so there was nothing left for her to do. She had been the instrument of the man whom she loved above all others-she had been the instrument (as she thought,) of his downfall. These reflections did sting her heart withi deep compunc- tion, notwithstanding her efforts to smother such feelings. The day had been dark and gloomy, and she had been in her room, listening to the, incessant noise of the pat- tering rain, and thinking of the past in a blending strain. But she could not stand this melancholy influence long, for conscience kept disturbing her rest. Rising on the impulse of the moment, she threw on her shawl and bon- net, and ran over to see Mrs. Crow-her indispensible companion.  "You, most of all, I wanted to see!" exclaimed the latter, handing her a seat. "And may judge the same of myself in connection with you, as I have turned out such a day," she respon- ded, taking the proffered seat.   &#xD;<pb n="560-561" xml:id="VAC8270-00000283"/> "What's the news?" asked her friend, after receiving the compliment. "Nothing , dull as death. One might die here of ennui, for we never see anybody, nor hear anything. Have you any news?" "Yes, some little item." "What is it?" asked, the true descendant of Mother Eve, hurriedly. "s I have heard from Mr. Sumner." "Ah indeed? what of him?" she asked, while a slight hue rose to her cheeks. "He is very ill!" "Ill?!" exclaimed Miss TLankinston, in a mingled tone of compunction and surprise. "Yes, and has been so ever since he left M-- . If ever corroding conscience struck hbi o talons in the heart, it was then. "How did you hear it?' she asked, after recovering from the shock. "Dr. Boon was summoned to-day to see him. The gentleman who came after him, told the news." "And did the Doctor go?" "Yes; I believe so."  Miss ,Lankinston was reflective for a moment. What if he should die?-and she has been working against him all this time! . , Mrs. Crow interrupted: "I am sorry that we! let anything be done in confer- ence, about that lnatter. But I know Icould not help it. You know we all thought that his avowed sickness was a feint, and all the Churches thought so too."  "Yes, it was not my fault, I know," protested Miss Lankinston, trying to ease her conscience by the declara- tion. "or mine," put in Mrs. Crow, quickly. "Did you learn whether he was dangerous or not?" "Yes, the physician had dispaired of his life, and told. him so; then he sent for Dr. Boon." "What did the" gentleman say was the matter "with him? ':   -         - "IHe told some one, that he had been at the point of death for several weeks, with the fever, but was recover- ing, when the news of his excommunication from Confer. ence reached him, and caused a relapse." , -  .  -  '  ' '  ' I   Miss Tiankinston turned pale. Yet, she summoned cour- ge to continue. "I suppose he is with his sister, Mrs. Bernard?" "Yes, he has been with her all the time."' "And I reckon has had good nursing." "I suppose so. I wonder if he knows where Annie 'acon is yet?"  "I don't know." Miss Lankinston gathered up her out-door accoutre- ients and left, for she did not feel theleast like engaging i conversation with any one after this-news. She sought her room, and as we hope, reflected on her rild career.  And now reader, after a few- days of intermission, let s pay a visit to Annie Bacon. The school was fast drawing to a close, and winter was  nding unmistakable premonitory symptoms of his near ?proach. Notwithstanding the icy breath from the orth, Annie, day by day, would seek the quiet retreat of er favorite resort-down under the tall oaks of the back ard. Madara Morris had taken notice of this imprudent eak, and had expostulated with her charge, but to no tect. "There is so much noise in here, Madame," she would lead, casting her eye around her.  "But your room,my dear Miss Bacon--I should think ould be far more comfortable." "It's comfortable enough, but I am not secure there om interruption."  "But why do you love. solitude so much? Ah, Miss acon, I am afraid that you are affected by selfishness. ou should cultivate love for society." "I did once, and found out its worth," she cried bitter- ,. "Henceforth, I am determined to be more exclusive, i my associations. Only the society of tried friends will seek." Madame Morris saw that some dark trouble was prey- lg on her friend, and sought her confidence. , "Tell me, Miss Annie, why are you so sad? I have ever seen you smile in my life. Tell me the cause of our grief; and accept my humble offeribig of condole- Lent," ,   &#xD;<pb n="562-563" xml:id="VAC8270-00000284"/> Annie hesitated, but the Madame urged her so earnest- ly, that she complied. "Ah, my young friend," said the Madare, after Annie had finished, "your's, indeed, does seem a sad fate, but do not think that it will be thus, always. No. God is watch- ing over your destiny with zealous care. His purposes are holy, and he will keep no good thing from you. Tiust to his providences, all will come aright in its proper time. But Miss Bacon I had almost forgotten that I had a letter fol' you." A letter?" cried the excited girl, for she was not looking for any from Mollie, at that time, and she had no other correspondent. "Yes, a letter, why should it surprise you so?" "Only because it is not time for me to receive one."  "Well, here it is, go to your room and read it," said the Madame, handing her the epistle.  4' Permit me, this one time, dear Madame, to go to the oaks," she implored. "No; it is too cold, and damp," "I must-don't object. I will promise for the future," and she was gone! There, let us follow ler. She hastily donned a bonnet and shawl, and went out by the back door. At the foot of the stairway, she met a host of merry school girls, who greeted her with smiles and ringing laughter. They loved their teacher, and sought to show it in every way possible. At the root of the same tall oak, she threw herself, and trcmblingly broke the seal, but it was many moments be- fore she could command courage to read, for, in spite of effort, a dark foreboding would pass now and then over her heart. The letter was from Mollie Weston. It ran thus: "DEAR ANNIE: The tidings of Mr. Sumner's illness reached M   this morning, and by request of Dr. ,01,on, I hasten to apprise you of it. It is said that he ,.,Is ,on you continually to forgive his rashness, and bega 1;ilt you be his friend again. He has been ill for nearly \vo tnonths, and was recovering several weeks back, but lie took a relapse, from which it is said, it is impossible for him to recover.   "( His family physician has given him up, and Dr. Boon  ,s:been called in. Mr. Sunmer is now with Mrs." Ber- rd, his sister, and I hope, is well nursed. "If you can, dear Annie, go to him, for he 5i d(1:ji;n! x r. Boon urged on me to write immediately, and to im- ore you to'go. Will you fly to him, Annie, in his dying i ur, and forgive him? I know you will, so I will not treat you uselessly. You must lose no time, or you ay be too late. "Yours in haste, MOLLIE.  "P. S. Those reports about Mr. Sumner going to see iss Lankinston, were false, Annie. Hehas ever sought ;er you, unremittingly, and I believe, his present illness, but the result of overtaxing his mind with such cares. ie report grew out of a mistake, so I learn. You must t let it prevent you from going, for it may be the last ae you will ever see him. "In haste,      MOLLIE." The long shadows of the tall oaks, turned into twilight ades, but Annie was all unconscious of this change. ie contents of that letter had stunned her.  "Dying! 'dying! dying!" she repeated, as she clutched e letter ip her hand, convulsively. ("lie is dying, and imploring my forgiveness, and I am  : away! Oh, my God, spare me this blow!" she prayed she threw herself on the bare ground in earnest sup- ication. The little stars had all taken their places in the broad nopy of the heavens, and the wind had borrowed an ditional chill from her northern sisters, striking its ef-^ -t home to those exposed to its biting blast. Then An-  e bethought herself. She might reach there in time to  )se. his eyes!  Braced by this thought, she hastened to the house, and ade the revelation to Madame Morris, who, though a ong believer in special Providence, began to waver af-  'such unfavorable tidings. But she promised her as- tance in getting a conveyance for the almost frantic '1, which she did, and Annie was soon- on her way, to nsole her lover in his dying hour.      . "Sister," feintly whispered the sick man, "sister, will  e never come?"     &#xD;<pb n="564-565" xml:id="VAC8270-00000285"/> WX   * -   4J .i X  a vL AJ Jx A  Jl A XAJ U . "To who6n do you refer my brother?" asked the sister, as she.'ressed her hand to his throbbing temples, heated by such rapid pulsations. "Oh that spirit which hovered over me last night in my dreams." "Alas, Charles, I know not where to send for her," replied the sister, divining his meaning. "But she will come, won't she?" he asked, pleadingly, and hopefully. "How can she, when she does not know of your sick- ness?" "Sister, she will not let me die here, unforgiven, and with- out beholding her oniee more! Oh, believe me, she will not!"  "Quiet yourself Charles, and do not hope vainly. You must not speak another word, for your strength is already overtasked." He seemingly obeyed, but scarcely had her words ended, before he relapsed in the- same delirious state, in which he had benl for several weeks. She drew the covering over his shoulders, and sat down and wept. A slight noise in the hall attracted'her attention. She arose to see what it was, when the real of .that spirit, which had hovered over the sick man, the night before, entered the room!! Had a thunder-bolt fallen at Mrs. Bernard's feet,' she could not have been more surprised. Yes, there stood Annie Bacon!-pale and silent, watching the sufferer, in speechless agony. "He lives! thank God!" she cried, 'while falling on her knees by the bedside, pouring out her heart to God, by that humility, in thankfulness for the blessing of the prolongation of Mr. Sumner's life. But he only stared at her, in this state of lost recognition! Mrs. Bernard stood by mute with astonishment. At length a feint smile flitted 6ver the sick man's face, but it died away, as soon as born. Slowly the petitioner raised herself frora her bended posture, and then stooped over the unconscious man, and imprinted a kiss, on the parched brow, which act we be- lieve, done more to cool that raging fever, than all the applications they had ever been nade,   Another smile, more lasting, lit up his face, and he ade an effort to speak, but could not.. Mrs. Bernard thinking it time to offer some civilities, it an end to the drama, by proposing to conduct the sitor to a room, but no, Annie would stay with Mr. imner the remainder of the evening. At the close of the day, she prevailed on Annie to seek st, for she had traveled all night before, without rest or freshments. Mrs. Bernard watched by the bedside of her brother at) night, as the night previously, the Doctor had relieved "r. At times, Mr. Sumner would become rational for a mo-  ent, but that moment was of such short duration, that t very little hope could be had. Towards the latter part of the night, he fell into a deep ;ep, which lasted for severaLhours. He awoke rational, but how long to stay so, no one Lew.- "Oh. it was such a beautiful dream!" he exclaimed, as s sister bent over him, moistening his parched lips. "Where is she, sister?" he whispered, as if afraid the ise of a natural tone, might banish the lovely vision, lich has crossed his brain. ' She is here Charles!" exclaimed the sister, unable to sceal the news, though she did not think it prudent to I him, then.        b "Here!" he exclaimed, in an under-tone. Yes, Charles, true to your prediction, she has come." Oh, I said so! I knew she would not let me'die un- rgiven. Where is she, sister? Can I see her now?" "'Not until morning." "I must! I must! I cannot wait. 'Go, my dear sister, d bring her to me, forthwith." The sister saw that delay now would make the matter irse, so she hastened to Annie's room, and awoke her. The pale girl, summoned her courage, and stood before - e sick man.    . "Annie!" he called, first, for he was watching for her. "Mr. Sumner!" and she--                ' And what?

Mrs. Bernard retired from the room, for she was con- scious that she was not needed there. When the morning sun rose, it rose on two as happy beings, as ever graced the earth. Dr. Boon called in the next evening with the expect: ation of witnessing a death-bed scene, or beholding the corpse of a dear. friend, but what was his surprize, when the patient greeted him with a smile of recog- nition-! He looked puzzled. Mr. Sumner marked the express- ion, and said-  "She is here, Doctor! She is here!-and'has forgiven me! Ah, the light was now manifested. He saw through it in a moment. "And has done more for you, than all the physic in Kentucky could do," he added with a smile. "es, I verily believe that I am getting better, I feel so at least."  "And look so too. But where is your great panacea? I would"like to see her." "You shall see her," remarked Mrs. Bernard risiug and leaving the room. In a few moments Annie entered. Dr. Boon was so shocked at her haggard look, that he involuntarily started. She advanced and offered her hand, cordially. Dr. Boon greeted her in the same manner, but he could not overcome his surprise at her changed appearance. Mr. Sumner began to recover perceptibly. The change of nurses had had a wonderful influence on the patient. "Dearest," said he, a few days after Annie's arrival, "how did you learn of my illness?" "Through Mollie Weston. Dr. Boon, on the day of his summon here, went and requestdeq her to write to me immediately, which she did." How fortunate it was, that we had to send for him. It was so kind in him." ' He is indeed, a kind friend."  "And one who never turns away aid, when it is need- ed," he suggested. "But," he continued, " there is one thing I want to ask you. Where have you been all this time?" Annie told him.   THE INVESTIGATION.       , 667 "Teaching school, and wearing yourself out?!" he  exclaimed. "I could do no better. You know my father ordered me from his house. I was obliged to have a living. I could not neglect my duty for that living, but sought means, by which I might gain a sustenance and be privi. leged to obey my Saviour also." Mr. Sumner. groaned, for he remembered that he, too, was to blame for that resort in his betrothed. "Oh, Annie," he said with a sigh, "I was so wrapped up in the Methodist Church, that I drove you from my bosom for it, but in return it has excluded mel!" "Excluded you?" she exclaimed; for she had not heard the intelligence. "Yes; some vile tongue, put out many false reports about me, I suppose, and it got in Conference that I was going to join the Baptists, so they considered the report true, and turned me out." "And will you not do it now?" she asked pleadingly, while large tears coursed down her pale cheeks.  Mr. Sumner saw how much effect his. answer was bound to have, and as he had been studying and found out how greatly in error he had been, he made a reply unhesitatingly. "yes Annie, I will. I never contemplated this, wheh I was in the Methodist Church, though I knew it was my duty; but now, since they have done what they have, I will have the courage to endure any trial. It was for the want of courage Annie, and nothing else. God has given me that strength, and I will obey." "The hand of Providence is in it, Mr. Sumner. God has conducted this by his own will," said Annie, warm- ly, after a slight pause. "Yes, Annie, I feel this sensibly. He has been work- ing for his glory all the time, and freely I ascribe to him  all honor and praise. It was for this purpose that he suffered some vile person to malign my name, and start those fatal reports about me, God,. through this trial,  has given me strength to go forward to perseverance, in obeying his commands." Annie remained silent, for she wanted to hear his  whole sentiments.

But, Annie, I had not the, courage to say so, or dare think so. Since then, God has forced circumstances on me, to give me courage to stem any flood of opposition that can be placed before me. Poverty stared me in the face once with frightful menacings, but now I do not care for its threats." "Oh, if my father would but recall me, how happy, Mr. Sumner, I would be, with that additional blessing " exclaimed Annie as she reflected on the present bestow- ment, and the probability of another. "But, dearest, do not let that grieve you so; though I know it must be hard to live under such estrangement, but we will console each other. We are poor, I know, but God will provide for us. Nor should we expect too many blessings at once. Our poverty will remind us of our dependelice on Him, and cause us not to forget Him." "I'know it. If we were rich and independent, we would be more apt to forget God. And if my father should re- claim me, that would be another blessing, which I am afraid I would grow proud and careless over. Yet I wish he would. Oh to think what a lonely life he isleading!" "Yes he is indeed ldhely Annie. He has secluded himself from society," And then Mr. Sumner related the circumstances connected with his visits to Mr. Bacon's house, and how he was treated. Annie was pained to hear it, and from it she could take but little hope. After Mr. Sumner could be persuaded to suffer Annie to leave him, she stole away to write a letter to Madame Morris, and Mollie Weston. Let us give a short extract from the one to the latter: "Believe me, dear Mollie, this is'an unexpected happi- ness, and were it not for the banishment by my father, I would be perfectly happy. But God is not idle. He is watching the course of those events, and he is guarding them. I feel confident that he will arrange matters tc suit his own will and purposes; with that, I am satisfied I submit all into his hands. I have written to Madame Morris, that she must learn to do without me, for Mr. Sumner will not near consent for me to go back." Annie might have told more,-"but it is not for the reader to see here, now.   CHAPTER XL. MHE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, IN WHCH IS PRODUCED, TES- TIMONY OF BAPTISTS APOSTOLIC DESCENT; AND, ALSO, EVI- DENCE BROUGHT FORWARD, PROVING THAT CHRIST'S CHURCH IS EVER TO REMAIN VISIBLE UNTIL HS SECOND ADVENT, FOR, "Upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." " o ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to ob- serve all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and lo, 1 AM 'WITH YOUAL WAY, UNTO THE END OF THE WORLD."'-Matt. xvi: I8; xxviii: 19, 20. IT was several weeks before Mr. Sampson returned to M--- .Business away had been very pressing, and then, to tell the truth, he was not goipg to break his neck just to hear a sketch of Baptist history. No; it seemed that that class had ever been the unwavering descendants of the "dispised Nazarene," and had stemmed the tide of buffeting, and scorn; even, they had been persecuted with most shocking punishments, which the popular world did not fancy, therefore, Mr. Sampson would not put-himself to any extra trouble to hear their blood-stained paths of history, traced. History!-volume after volume has been written, which is even denominated Church History, but few wri- ters have travelled but a little distance, before they have found themselves enclosed in the gloomy walls of Baby-  ion!-the prime source of corruption-flooding the-earth with harlots and abominations. Protestants have searched the dusty scraps of the past, to write themselves a history, but where do the contents of time-worn tomes lead them, but to the IRoMAN CATH- OLIC CHURCH?!! BABYON, yes BABYON, the great, "THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMNATIONS OF THE EA TH," is the fountain head from whence springeth this mighty  48  &#xD;<pb n="570-571" xml:id="VAC8270-00000288"/> rushing host of protestants! And they can trace their Churches but a few centuries, before they find themselves the lawful descendants of that GREAT MOTHER, clothed in Baptist's blood, and pontifical robes! constituting the apparel of purple and scarlet. Yes, SHE, the source of bloodshed, of debasement, and of false doctrines, has given from HER OWN body, a nu- merous progeny of-" harlots," and "abominations." And let each false Church be traced to its origin, and you will find this WOMAN to be its MOTHER! so let every false doc- trine be traced, and within the gates of this woman's ju- risdiction, you will find them there propagated, and duly- -transmitted to her, natural offspring! .Eoen baptism for the remission of sins! We do not intend to write the history of the Baptists; no; for our pen: is inadequate to the task, but we only wish to give a slight sketch, so that the reader may know that the Baptist Church is not a Reforni from Rome, nor of such recent birth that the grey headed sires of this age, can  tell by memory of its orqiin, or the cause thereof! The Church of Christ is never spoken of in sacred history, as being an offshoot of that putrescent body of abominations; nor is there any intimation within the lids of prophesy, of any class or classes, arising after the ascent of our Saviour, but the "harlots," which are to issue from mys- tic Babylon. True, some of God's people are to be found in this corrupt sink of abominations, but the Lamb's wife is not to spring from hence-that kingdom "wu hich is not of this world," was not to come of the fruits of the woman, arrayed in such meaning attire. Our Saviour brought from the eternal courts of Heaven, its formation and laws, and implanted them here, under the motto: "AND LO, I AM WITH YOU ALWAY, UNTO THE END OF TIE WORLD," at dawn of which time, he shall so come in like manner as he ascended! After Dr. Boon returned from his last visit to see Mr. Sampson, he contrived to get the company convened once more. Though Mr Sampson was very late in arriving, he was in time to hear the beginning, an event, about which he was not very particular. Mr. Weston was the first to speak. Gentlemen, we have been tracing some very interest.            . :     /   ing subjects, but none half so interesting as the one be- - fore us. In this investigation, three different denomina- tions have been engaged, which involves the entire (or nearly so,) views of men, as regards Christianity. The dates of the origin of two Churches have been noticed- the Methodist and Campbellitee And now we are led to investigate the history, or date of the Baptist Church's origin.. You remember that I have held the doctrine that there has been a succession of the Church, since the days of John the Baptist-that the Church of Christ was never to become extinct-inasmuch as Christ said that the gates of hell were not to prevail against it, and that he promises to be with it always, even unto the end of the world! From this we must know, that there have ever been those, who have kept the 'faith which was once delivered unto the Saints,' and the ordinances as deliv- Qred' to us. "The texts just referred to, you will admit, Mr. Samp- son, prove beyond all controversy, that Christ has never deserted his Church, so that principalities could prevail over it to extermination." "Certainly Mr. Weston, we must conclide, and even admit as much."   " "Then, furthermore, Mr. Sampson,:you cannot say that the Methodist is that Church." "No, for it sprang up, but little over a a century ago!" "Nor the Reform, Mr. Sampson." "No; for-that is, it was first visible only about a half century ago," stammered the confused man, hardly con-  scious of what he was saying. "Nor the Presbyterian," pursued Mr. Weston. "No, for it is but a reformation of the fifteenth century." "Nor the Episcopal."  "No, for it is only about five centuries old, while the Church of Christ must her near, or over eighteen!"  "You will admit, also, Mr. Sampson, that the Baptist Church is neither a reform from the Roman Catholic Church, nor of recent birth." "But was set up by one Roger Williams, in Rhode Island, not exceeding a life-time ago, put in Mr. Samp- son, maliciously..  "That is what our'opponents try to make the world  ,i  &#xD;<pb n="572-573" xml:id="VAC8270-00000289"/> 5f 72   -   LEANDER HALL. believe, sir, but history contradiets it. The credit given to Roger Williams as the founder of religious democra- cies of the western globe, or the first establishment of the Baptist Church thereon, belongs more to Dr. John Clark, the pastor of the first Baptist Church in America. And this sentiment of democracy, can be traced through- out the history of the Baptists of every age. But un- derstand me, I would not detract one iota of credit due Roger Williams, as regards that point, but as the foun. der of the first Baptist Church in America, he was not.-  Nor of the Baptists at any period. Long, long before he was thought of, we find this people spreading like an inundation over the globe."  "Which began then, with the Mad Men of Munster!" again interrupted Mr. Sampson, spitefully. "So our Methodist friends loudly publish in the bounds of their Book Concern. And by which many are led to believe that that is really our origin. But thanks to kind Providence, our enemies, some at least, have cried out against that'false idea. We are indebted- to YAubigne, for the horror of that affair, who says: 'One point it seems necessary to guard against misapprehension. Some persons imagine that the Anabaptists of the times of the Reformation, and the Baptists of our day are the same. But they are as different as possible.' "Fessenden's Encyclopedia, quoted with approbation by D'Aubigne, says:  ' ' AABAPTIST: Th6e English and Dutcdh Baptists do not consider the word al at all applicable to their sect.' 'It is but justiceto observe, that the Baptists of Holland, England, and United States, are to be essentially distinct from those seditious and fanatical individuals above men- tioned, as they profess an equal aversion to all principles of rebellion, or the one for the enthusiasm of the other.' Pref. to Hip. Ref. p. 10. "Remember, Mr. Sampson, that D'Aubigne quotes this from Fessenden, with approbation. If he has taken up the defense of our cause, then it may be relied on that there was nothing dark on our pages. Never was a more false, or viler accusatio;, saddled on an iinocent people, than that charge, but thank God, our bitterest enemies clear our name of this disgraceful affair." "Indeed, I feel relieved, for it has been :my impression ,   THE INVESTIGATION.        578  for years, that the Baptists were foremost in that rebel- lion," said Dr. Boon. "I know, Doctor, that impression has industriously been circulated by those who never read scarcely a dozen pages of our history, but the more thoughtful enemies have been more particular about what impressions they - have made, publicly. Yet, Mr. Sampson, if you still contend that that was our origin, you shall have further proof against it, given by our enemies." "Let us hear it, anyhow," said Dr. Boon, anxiously.: "You shall be gratified. Mosheim a Lutheran, and a bitter enemy to the Baptists, had all Opportunities of be- ing perfectly conversant with the facts, says:-  "'The true origin of that sect which acquired the name of Anabaptists, by their administering anew the rite of baptism to those who came over to their commu- nion, and derived that of Mennonites, from that famous man, to whom they owe the greatest part of their present felicity, is hid in the remote depths of antiqiditg, and is conse-  quently extremely difficult to be ascertained.' Vol. vi. p.427. "Mosheim tells us that our history ' is hid in -the remote depths of antiquity,' instead of originating at the rebellion of Munster, or with Roger Williams, of America. But  this is not all, other historians give authentication to this declaration of Mosheim's. Zuingulius carries us back to the days of the first innovations in the Church. Hear his testimony upon Mosheim's. "The institution of anabaptism is no novelty, but for 1300 years has caused great disturbance in the Church, and has acquired such a strength, that the attempt in this age, to contend with it appeared futile for a time.'  ( Who was Zuingulius," asked Mr. Sumner. "He was a celebrated Swiss' Reformer." "At what period did he write?" "In the 15th century, from which, subtracting 13 cen- turies, and our history is carried to the days when grcivous wolves began to enter the Church, and when a party seceded,  because of the corruption in 225! Infant baptism was the first noticeable inroad, made on the purity of the Christian doctrine. When it was insisted on, a party of  strict adherents to the teachings of the Bible, seceded, and made an effort to establish the primitive purity of  &#xD;<pb n="574-575" xml:id="VAC8270-00000290"/> 674 -     LIBEaDE HD ALL. the Church, in opposition to arising corruptions. Then Anabaptism began, ar rather, the practice of re-baptizing those who cime to them from the corrupt Church, whichll practiced infant baptism. The Anabaptists urged the plea (for administering over this ordinance to-those who had been baptized by other sects,) that they had not been scripturally baptized, as many had only received infant baptism, which could ndt be called believer's baptisl, consequently, not valid. But the Apocalyptic 'woman,' which was drunken with the blood of saints, has not reveled all this time so vora- ciously on martyred feasts, without more evidences being transmitted to us. No; we have not been trodden down by the heel of persecution, lo, these fifteen hundred years, without more record of it. Then we appeal to Cardinal Hossius, President of the Council of Trent, in 1560, A. D. He was one of the brightest stars of the Ro- man Catholic Church, and a learned man, indeed. Hear him, thouffh a bitter enemy, and one who had rather raise the sword of annihilation against us, than to exculpate us of a crimethough we might be innocent. "' If the truth of religion were to be judged of by the readiness and cheerfulness of which a man of any sect shows in suffering, then the opinion and persuasion of no sect can be truer and surer than that of the Anabaptists, (Baptists) since there have none for these twelve hundred years past, that have been more generally punished, or that have more cheerfully and steadfastly undergone, and even offered themselves to the most cruel sorts of punishments, than these people.' "Remember, Mr. Sampson, this testimony was given, in the middle of the 16th century, and taken from it the 'twelve hundred years past' and we are carried almost back to the century, to which Zuingulius carried us in his tes- timony, and the time when innovations began to creep into the Church; but if you still believe that we found our origin with the Mad-Men of Munster, I will produce more evidence, to the contrary." "Oh, no, Mr. Weston, I had always heard that story, but you have read from reliable authors enough to prove the untruthfulness of it. Don't put yourself to any farther trouble," he replied graciously, but we suspect t at Mr. Sampson was wishing to hear no more of Bap, tist history.   "Let us hear it all, Bro. Weston," quickly interrupted  Dr. Boon. Mr. Weston complied.  "Dr. J. J. Durmont, Chaplain to the King of Holland, . and Dr. Ypeig, Professor of Theology, in the University of Groningen, were appointed by the king, to ascertain whether the Dutch Baptists had any claims in history. Hear their report, which was the result of deep investiga-  tion, and hard study. Be it understood also, that this report has never even been attempted to be disproved! "  The Mennonites (Baptists--we have never had our present name until of late years,) are descended from the tolerably pure evangelical Waldenses, who were driven by persecution into various countries; and who, during the latter part of the twelfth century, fled into Flanders, and into the provinces of Holland and Zealand, where they lived simple and exemplary lives--in the villages as farm-  ers, iq the towns by trades; free from the charge of any grosslimmoralities, and professing the most pure and sim-  pie principles, which they exemplified in a holy conversa- tion. They were, therefore, in existence long before the Reformed Church of the Netherlands.'  * Sir, this report should stop the mouth of every dis- believer in the antiquity of the Baptists, in Christen- dom! Men as bitter towards us as was the Pope of the  seventh century was, when men of that character give such an account of us, rest assured that there is still more HD! [N THE REMOTE DEPTHS OF ANTIQUITY, which Cardinals, en- dowed with the Pope's bull, have sought unremittingly to destroy, and which Protestants have wilfully suffered to lie in ruins, and eve i have assisted in committing those witnesses to the flames! Yes, the children of Babylon-- the branches of the Roman Catholic Church, have been faithless in this duty! Voltaire, Hume, Gibbon, and other infidels, with deistical writers, have been more faith- ful, in opening the record of our history, thanour mod- ern divines of the Protestant order." "But why did you not record your own history?" asked Mr. Sampson, provokingly.' "Because our Pedobaptist friends would not let us do it! Our press wasi stopped, our papers burnt, and our  ' brethren were kept in dread, in the wilds of uncultivated mountains, and the narrow confines of caves and dens. , !  &#xD;<pb n="576-577" xml:id="VAC8270-00000291"/> -f7O gB    LEANDER HA LIt. Throughout the fluctuating fortunes of history, our Church was held in the bitter bourn of dread and appre- hension; nor were those feelings entertained for nothing, for the caves of the Piedmont vales, and the Albigensian vallies, will attest by unobliterated signs, until the day of resurrection, of the sufferings of God's people. Ah, that cruel edict-which went forth from the Pope's lips, and which caused thousands of innocent babes to perish in the suffocating caves of Piedmont vallies, besides men and women-ah, its memory will never die, nor will the parchment be lost, for when eternity arises to summon time to accountherself, it will be brought forth, signed and executed by the Pope's aulthority, the-'PERSH- ING OF ONE MLLION OF INOFFENSIVE LIVES IN 1243, BY THE POPE'S DECREE!!' Well might the saints thus martyred, cry ' How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood, on them that dwell on the earth?' Baptists would have preserved their history complete, had Pedo-baptists stood still. But instead, they lifted wickedly the sword of ex- termination, and sought to obliterate from the pages of history the memory of such a community! Mr. Semnms, when you suffered your children to be baptized in infan- cy, you did that much to perpetuate the decrees of the Pope. No wonder you adhere to the principle, a child will have its mother's features and ways, and will hold up for them, no matter how disproportionate they may be. Mr. Semms looked greatly astonished History had not held up these glaring facts, to his vision before. Preacher Sampson moved his seat and took off his bur- nished " glasses," and relaxed back into stillness. One of the lay-brethren of the Campbellite Church, began to pat his foot industriously,'but that device, of concealment, did not succeed, for in spite of his efforts to the contrary, he would look discomfited. Mr. Westoni proceeded: "That the Baptists are of ancient origin, and that their history can be traced back to the days of the purity u' the Church, I have proven, but I will still give more evidence, even through the channels of our enemies: "Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, gives the fol- lowing:-' We have now seen that the Baptists, who were formerly called Aanabaptists, and in' latter times   THE INVESTIGATION.         677  Mennonites, were the original Waldenses; and who have  long in the history of the Church, received the honor of that origin. On this account (hear it, oh, ye that doubt  our evangelical origin,) the Baptists may be considered the  only Christian community which has stood since the Apostles; *  and as a Christian society which preserved pure the doctrine  of the Gospel through all ages!!! The perfectly correct  external economy of the Baptist denomination, tends to confirm the truth, disputed by the Romish Church, that   : the Reformation brought about in the sixteenth century, was in the highest degree ;uecessary; and at thesame time goes to repudiate the erroneous notion of the (Gatholics, that  their conmmunion is the most ancient!!'  "And yet our enemies will circulate that we originated  at the insurrection of Munster! No wonder that such false mockery should be hissed at us, since we are unwor-  thy followers of the dispised Nazerene! But this is not  all. Chevalier Bunsen, a man of considerable learning, and one who searched the records of partial history,  tells us of the nature of the Church, in the age to which  Zuingulius carried the history of the Anabaptists. Hear him after his disinterested researches. "'The Church adhered rigidly to the principle, as constituting the purport of the baptism ordained by Christ, that no one can be a member of the communion  ot the saints, but by his own solemn vow, made in the presence of the Church . It was with this understand- ing that the candidate for baptism was immersed in wa- fer, and admitted as a brother upon his confessing of the  Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." "And here, Mr. Sampson, are the principles of the Baptists of our age, and haveever been thus throughout all ages, since their first origin, of which I will give fur- ther evidence in due time. That this class existed from the time, when the Pope first sat on his throne of dark- ness up to the present, we have only to cite you to the further testimony of our enemies.  "The learned Mr. Edwards of America, says: ' In every age of this dark time, (of popery,) there appeared par- ticular persons in all parts of Christendom, who bore a testimony against the corruptions and tyranny of the Church of Rome. There is no one age of Antichrists even in the darkest times, but ecclesiastical historians.

God was pleased to maintain an ulinterrupted succession of manly witnesses throlugh the whole time, in Britain,l as well as in Germany and France ; private persons and minlisters; some, nlagistrates and persons of greait distinction.

But this is not all the testilno- ny we have.  Many other writers are befire us, which to quote from, wounl nmake the matter too tedious. "Zuingullius, the Swiss Refoi)rmler, of the fifteenth cen- tury, and a cotemporary with Luther, IMunlcer, and Stork,carries us back in testimony of our history, to thle firstof the third century. IMoshe3im tells u1 ti:ltt oulr history is hid in' the remote depths of antiqtity.' Durmont and Ypeig, tells us that we were therefore in existence long before the Reformed Church of the Netherlands!' And up- on this evidence, we are told by another enemy, that the Baptists are the' 'ONLY CRIISTIAN COMMUNITY WHCC HAS STOOD SINCE TIE APOSTLES!

Mr., Sampson looked wildly arouind, but said nothing. MrI. Sem1n- I changed hs seat uneasily, and runIling hIis filgers thr'ouh ihis hair silled audibly ; nor did he seem at all disposed to break the then prevailing silence.

No one, unless a member of that Chulrch lhas a right to commune-no excluded individual, (thoughl he has been scripturally baptized,) has the right, for such we are commanded, to let be to us, as heathens and- strangcrs, and we are further commanded, to mark those who do. not teach the doctrine as the Apostles handed it to us; and ' AVOID TEM.' Therefore, my friends,-you who per- vert the Scriptures, and are iot of the Church of God, we are not only commanded to have no fellowship with, but we are told to AVOID and keep away from you. ' Now I beseech you,; brethren, mark them 'which cause divis- ions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye halve learned, and avoid them.' Rorn. xvi. 17. Thus we are commanded to do, and thus we will do, by the help of God!" "Was Zuingulius a Baptist?" asked Mr. Semms, not knowinvg what else to say, after hearing such astounding facts, and as it seems, was still laborinc under the 'influ- ence of that historian's testimony. "No; le rather raised his hand against them, than for them. All Catholics engaged in the massacre of the Anabaptists, and even the great Reformer, Luther, was as bitter towards them, as gall."  "Not Martin Luther '" "Yes, Martin Luther, the acknowledged founder of the Lutheran Churqc!  eic heaped bitter denunciations on the Waldelsian Church, and blamed them much for anabaptism." Mr. Semms drew a long sigh. Mr. Weston continued.  "There are many other great men, on whom yon halve been accustomed to look, with reverence, that have engaged in this sacrilegious work. The Childrcll of' Babylon have ever been true to their parent's nlature.

Free government, free thought, free express- ion, and free choice,. have ever been the watch-word of the Baptist's principles; against which, Pedo-baptism has persistently warred." "Why, I always thought that you were the strictest and hardest sects in the world!" exclaimed Mr. Semms, somewhat confused. "We are strict in adhering to the teachings of the Bi- ble, but our government is not monarchial in its form. Yours is, Mr. Semms, and the spirit of your government was framed from  Romish sacramentaries, and has, throughout, the impress of hierarchy. Your clergymen rule the Church, and your bishops rule your clergymen. Our government is different. The lay-members, along With the deacons and bishops, all rule, with equal author- ity. Our government is democratical, and so is that of the Bible. The Baptists of every aoe have maintained this form of government in their Churches. Mosheim describes this form of government as belonging to, a sect which could neither be his; or any of the Protestant dis- senters. Chevelier Bunsen speaks of the Church as being the sole executive power of the Baptists, in the third cen- tury, and in fact all historians speak of the Baptists, un- der all their diversified names, as being possessed of dem- ocratic sentiments. We will subjoin an account given by Dr. Fishback, of. Lexington, Ky: "'Mn. EDITOR: The following circumstance, which oc- curred in the State of Virginia, relative to Mr. Jefferson, was detailed to me by Elder Andrew Tribble, about six years ago, who since died, wheri ninety-two or three years old. The facts may interest some of your readers. "'Andrew  Tribble was the pastor of a small Bap- tist Church which held monthly meetings at a short dis- tance from Mr. Jefferson's house, eight or ten years be- fore the American Revolution. Mr. Jefferson attended the meetings of the Church several months in succession, and after one of them, he asked Elder Tribble to go home and dina with  witm h which he complied.

"Yes, until it is convenient for us all to meet again." When will that be?"  Preacher Sampson was the first to answer. "I don't think I can be with you before next week; say next Wednesday night.' "Very well, Mr. Sampson. That time will suit me as well as any other." Without further remarks, the company dispersed.' "."

THE RECONCITEMENT, WHEREBY WE ARE LED TO THNK THAT THOUGH TiE LORD IS MYSTERIOUS IN HS PROVIDENCES, HE IS  "Rlqliteous in all His ioays, and holy in all His woorks."- Ps. cxlv: 17. ' Myr daughter! my daughter! Mr. Weston! Cannot I get to set her?

But now I am dying! dying! and she is far away, weepilg over helr fate. My God, what a bitter cup!" raved the sinki)ng man, as he tossed himself feebly on the bed. Mr. Weston had been summoned to the bed-side of old Mr. Bacon, who, as reported, was dying! IIc had been attacked suddenly, while sitting at break- fast that mornllng, with paralysis, a disease, in its finale, has ever baffled the skill of every physician in the known world. Dr. Boon stood by, looking intently out of the window, but when the old man began his lamentations, he turned to watch his suffering countenance. The sad tone, the frantic enunciations, told forcibly of his condition. "Will she not' come to me now? Does she know that I am pa'sing from earth? Will no one send for her? Oh my danlughter! Mr. WAeston, where is she?" "We will send for her,-Mr. Bacon, if you say so," re- plied Mr. Westhn, as he yielded his hand to the clutching. grasp of the agonized man. But I will be gone before she can get here," moaned the dying man, in despair. : She is nearer than you think, perlaps." "Hlow? Where! is she here?" he asked eagerly, vain- ly endeavoring to raise his head.

Dr. Boon had the forethought to send for her tiis morning, when you were first taken." "But, before several lhours shall pass, I will be far from ,these mundane shores," groaned he, pressing his hand to 'his lihead. "No, Mr. Bacon, your pulse is strong; there are no symptoms of your dying, yet. You must be quiet, for every word you speak is consuming your strength," said Dr. Boon, pIressilig his wrist between his fingers. Mr. Bacon seetedl relieved, but the consciousness of a nearc approlaclliil dleath, was oil him. Dr. BoonL moved to a window, and pushed aside the curltail, admniittiig light, which revealed the ravages of ,a Ibw lhours of sutlfring, ilcident to that disease. lie began to lhave serious apllprclensions of Annie not being able to reach there in time.

His breatlingl became better, but the same deathly: pallor was setthed on Iiis countenance. The d  dry drgged slowly by. Dr. Boon and Mr. Wes- ton kept thiir post at the bedside. As the shadows of the tall trees began to lengthlen, a perceptible change took place. Iis breathing became more rapid! his pulse  weaker and slower! Annie comies not! Dr. Boon has stood near a window watching for her,  nearly two hours.  Presently the noise of a carriage is heard in the dis- tance. 4"She is' coming," said Mr. Weston, for he knew that the sound proceeled from a fast traveling velhicle. Then I will administer another dose of this strength- ening, wine, so that he may be able to talk," whispered- Dr. Boon, as lie measured out the quantity. The carlriage approaclhed the house rapidly. Annie did not wait for the driver to open the door, but she bounded out in front, and stepped upon the thresh-  hold frrom which she had beeti banished, in utter hope- !  &#xD;<pb n="584-585" xml:id="VAC8270-00000295"/> M4r       L A N AND-.R RJALL. lossnessior four iong monthls! She entered cautiously, for she did not know thtat her fathr ljad been calling, fdr her. "What it he turns me ofl now?" she cjacllated to herself, as she opened the front door, which, apparently, yielded instinctively to her touch. Dr. Boon met her in the hall. She scanned his tountenance for hope, but it was not there. He motioned her to be still. She obeyed, while a death- ly palloi overspread her countenance. "is there no hope?" she whispered, hastily. '- I must be honest,. Annie, there is none!" "My God!" she exclaimed, as she sank to the floor, in the intensity of her feelings. -"'You must bear up, Miss Bacon, and come and see yoir father before it is too late." "'Will he receive me?" she asked in a hoarse whisper, bordering on insanity. "Yes, he has called for you often.'" Oh, I am so glad to hear-this, Doctor. Lead the way. I am strong; trust to me," she said, as she satw him scruti- nizing her, doubtfully.  'Dri. Boon opened the door, and lead the way to Mr. Bapcn's bed side! -Aiunni'ei stood before him!

But the rattling in his throat, and the diffi-  culty in swallowing the dose, told plainly that death was near finishing his dark task.

I do regret that I dil not yield to my conscience once, and obey my Saviour in baptism, but it is too late now. I trustl alone ill the merit of Christ's blood, for my salvation. I hlave no fear of death. Thoughr my sills hlave been many, tthev shall all be covered with the righlteousness of Christ. I can do lnotling but submit myself to him.

Here his strength failed him again, and he paused for breath. A death rattle in his throat began, which told that his words would be few. Dr. Boon offered another cordial, but the old man shook his head, for le could not swallow it! He cast a lingering look at his attendants, and then held his hand to his weeping daughter, and asked Mr. Weston to pray. A fervent petition for the dying man was pleaded be- fore the-throne of God. Ah, how earnestly 1Mr. Westn)l poured out his soul; in full confidence, too. He had faith. It was manifested in his very look, and when he h prayed for the soul, that was about to take its departure, he prayed in faith.  When the prayer was over, it was discovered that the spirit had taken its flight, without a struggle! Annie sank on the floor in the paroxysm of her grief, but Dr. Boon saw that she was removed to her room, and c(,mfortable, before he left.

(Of what benefit is a tower of immovable gold? or of what use is Burneo's rapid  river? or the greattEldorado?-burried beyond the reach of man? The funeral services were attended to the next day. Citizens, of all classes, were in attenidance. As no Mcth- odist preacher was any where near, Mr. Weston was  called on to perform the last sad rites ot obsequies.  The second day after Mr. Bacon's death, was a lonely day to Annie, though some of her relations had conme in  to stay several days with her. She was compelled ;to keep hei' bed for a length of time afterwards, as excite- ment and fatigue, together with grief, had had their effect. Mollie Weston staid much of the time with her friend, and was indeed a great source of condolement. She had free intercourse with Annie's heart, and lit was a great commiseration to the latter, to have some friend in whom she could confide, and to whom she could pour out her grief. Dr. Boon, also called often to see Annie, for she stood  in need of medical advice, for some days. A' week passed, and she was recovering, spirits and body, butsslowly, and scarcely perceptible. "Ah Mollie," said she one day, as. ler friend sat by her bed side, "What an eventful year this has been to m-e. Events have chased each other away, and I have been kept in such a whirl of excitement, that I can hardly re- call them. Yet in all, I see the hand of God. He has turned everything to his purpose. Sometimes, I have thought that he had deserted me, but no, before the thought was hardly born, He would work sonic provi- dence to my good, and I would be left a debtor of His unfathomable merec, again."

"And what is that?" ;) "My father's death." "Ah Annie, that was indeed a severe trial, but God had some divine purpose in permitting it. Rest assured, he is watching vigilantly, over all these circumstances." "I know it Mollie," she replied with a sigh, and then relapsed into silence. Presently she spoke again. Mollie, I have been so frustrated since my return, that I have forgotten to send to the office for letters. I wish you would send a servant, I think it probable that Mr. Sumner has written, before this."- Mollie' obeyed, and returned and resumed her seat. Annie gazed at her a moment, and then said:- "Mollie I want to ask you a question; will it be out of place?" "What is it?" she asked, blushing to her temples, for she had anticipated the nature of the query. "Tell me, Mollie, if you think me wrthyli of your con- fidence, whether you and Dr. Boon are engaged or not?" Mollie complied with the request, and she made a bold confession, too. She told Annie how silently she had. loved Dr. Boon all the time, but she was under the im- pression that his attention to her, was all due to Annie's credit. "How mistaken you were," said Annie, when she had finished the narrative. "lHe told me a few days after he first saw you, how well pleased he was with you, and that the only objection he hadto you, was that you were such a strong Baptist! He also said a great deal about close- communion, and condemned it bitterly. Who would have thought then that he would be where he is now, and in so short a time? "Oh Annie, I hoped and prayed for this so earnestly! I knew God would, in his own good time, bring him to see his error." "Why Mollie, I had no idea " she could but exclaim. "Yes Annie, I had full confidence in it. Ihad several conversations with him, when he would laugh at my simple notions, and oh4 how many hours of wrestling, those careless smiles would cause me!" "Did he never express doubt about his religion?" -    THB- ItVES TIGATIOT.       589 "Yes, once he said he had some scruples, but then on the spot, consoled himself with the thought that all Christians have doubts." "How strange it all seems to me! Who -would have thought this last winter?"  "God is mysterious in his providences.". "And as equally sure."' "Yes, he never forsakes his children." By this time, the servant had returned from the office. There was a letter for Annie. Though short, it was sat- isfactory. For the gratification of some curious reader, we will give the contents, verbatim et literatim: "DEAREST ANNIE :-Once more, after a long time, I find myself blessed with the privilege and opportunity of writing to you. I have not recovered as rapidly, since: you left, as when you were with me, but I think the ex- citement consequent on your leaving under such auspi- ces, had much to do with my slight retard in convales- cence. I am getting able to sit up awhile every day, but a little while, indeed. "As soon as I find myself-sufficiently recovered, I shall start for M-; nor do I dread the time for, Ar nie, I long to follow my Saviour in the watery grave, and shall reserve that pleasure, until I can be in the presence of those whom I have been accustomed, to teach to do otherwise. And there Annie, I will recant my former doctrine'of Romish rites, and I will also call on those whom I have been in- strumental in leading wrong-I shall call on them to re- nounce what I have taught them, and take the Bible on- ly, for their guide. I cannot feel clear until I do this. Sister joins me in love to yon. You must excuse this short epistle, as I am not strong enough to write a length- ier one. With the prospect .of seeing you soon, I hasti- ly close. "' Yours, in hope. - A. C. SUMNER." "I think he is right, Annie, in making a public re- cantation, don't you?" said Mollie, after listening to the reading of the letter. "Yes; and I am very glad to hear it," "When was that letter dated?"                .  &#xD;<pb n="590-591" xml:id="VAC8270-00000298"/> 690       LEANDER  HALL. "Let me see-nearly two weeks ago." "Thue it must have been in the offce for some tihe:" "Yes, and I foirgot to send for it. In fact, I have hard- ly known wha't I have been about for the last two or three weeks," said she, re-folding the epistle, and placing it in the envelope. It was arranged for one of Annie's aunts, by marriage to live with her, so tlat she could remainat the old home- stead. The servants were retained, just as they were. No alterations were made scarcely, in the manner of living. Mrs. Nancc, Annie's aunt, was a kind old soul, willing for each one to have his or her way, never taking that prerogative to any extent herself. Though possess- ed of many good qualities, she was not a very sociable creature, so Annie found the lack of company very de- pressing, yet Mbllie Weston was to see her often; and a few other friend s of M-- . Leander Hall still maintained in a degree, its silent grandeur, the monotony being relieved, now and then, by the visit of some one, whlo always came in grave and unpretending colors, for remember, reader, it was a house of rmourtlilg. The servaits which had been trained to step lightly, and wear subdued and mysterious airs, were found in the same garb, though the seclusion of the house was some- what over with.  Vill you c(all to see her?" "Whom?"  "Alnie Bacon, of course." "  N; I think I will keep away, myself." "Why?" "Because she has become so wrapped up in the Wes- ton family; and then, Mr. Sumner is coming back very soon, to marry her." "Why shoiud you make that a reason for not going to see Annie?"  "I don't want to associate with such people." But Alnnie is ricl." "I can't lielp it, I don't expect to visit her, for I would be certain to come in contact with Mr. Sumner." "Well, as for my part, I am gning to see her, and then I am goilg to ask her to cone and see me. I'm not afraid of Mr. Sumner, if he is going to join the Baptists."   TnE- INVESTIGATION.       OO.1 The above conversation occurred between Mrs. Crow and her friend, Miss Lankinston. The latter protested bitterly against visiting Annie, while the other, a woman more addicted to the world, and easily dazzled by riches, yielded to the natural inclination of a woman.  Miss. Lankinston had her reasons for not wishing to see Annie Bacon, and Mr. Sumner.  The reader can very well account for them. Both of our fair Sisters relapsed into silence, for a wlile--Mrs. Crow, in pleasant anticipation, while Miss Lalnkinston in dread.               .

We wonder if she ever felt a touch of compunction?  Think you; that those long nights were spent iu sleep, alone? Did she ever close those lids, to revel in blissful dreams, far away from the reach of conscience6? Did no spirit ever whisper that all was not right-?-That a some- thing of a dark, sullen and foreboding countenance, ever haunted her with suggestions, which made an unpleas- ant souvenance indeed, cannot be doubted. :, OCHAPTER    XLII. DOCTOR BOON AND 3IR. MAYFIELD HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSA- TION, IN WHCH TIE FORMER SILENCES THE RIDICULE ON THE INFLUENCE OF TIlE HOLY SPIRIT, BY GIVING OUR SAVIOUR'S OWN EXPLANATION, WHCH IS, "The wzind bloweth whereit listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell from whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every oe- that is born of the Spirit."- John iii: 8. THE night was very cold and disagreeable, and the snow-flakes h1ad just begun to whiten the earth with a ghostly windillng-sheet, while the beautiful moon, strug- gling anon, with the ashy clouds that canopied the heav- eIs iln broken volumes of irregular interstices, sent her genial rays, now and then, on the lone night traveler. Dr. Boon had sallied forth, sorry that it was necessary for him to make a professional- call on such a night, and thinking that he was not at all likely of meeting any one on the occasion; but in this thought he was mistaken, for scarcely had he turned the corner leading from his shop, than he met with Mr. Mayfield, the staunch Reformer. "On your way home, Mr. Mayfield?" he accosted him, as he recognized him. Yes; I've been down below here a piece, and over-   THE TNVESTIGATION.        59  staid my tire. Whither are you bound, going fromn  home?" "I am going to see a patient over here on Cross atreet. Quite a cold night?" "Yes, very, indeed," was the brief reply. Dr. Boon was of a very loquacious disposition, at ordi- nary times, and so to-night he pursued the conversation, not noticing his friend's indisposition to engage freely in such pastime. The fact was, Mr. Mayfield had shunned his friend since he refused to give aid in calling Mr. Johnson to M--- , to assist in a protracted meeting. "Where have you kept yourself all this fall, that I have not seen you?" asked the Doctor.  "I have been confined at home with a sick family," he replied. "Ah, indeed? I had not heard of it. (No wonder, since Mr. Mayfield had summoned another plhysician, vowing, after Dr. Boon left the CLmpbellite Church, that  he should neveir practice in his family again.) lIas that illness been very protracted?" he asked, as they walked alone. "Yes, we have had several very serious cases; and one protracted."  "Ah!" exclaimed Dr. Boon, the truth flashing across his mind. They walked on rapidly, in silence for a while. At length Dr. Boon spoke: 4 When we saw each other last, Mr. Mayfield, we were at variance on a particular subject, and since then, my half-formed ideas of our misconceptions have matured, and now I am convinced of my former erithr. I believe it is my duty to proclaim this to my fellow-man. I feel that you are also wrong in your religious notions too, and  let me, Mr. Mayfield, conjure you to look to this matter, well. It is of such vast importance, that you ought not to turn off, unless you are sure." Mr. Mayfield was silent. Dr. Boon continued: ' I no longer speak in doubt, and exhort in indecision, but now my friend, I know that there is a great error lying at your door. Will you not seek to remove it? You are  now trusting 1o externals, which must fail. Let me ask  - you one question.. What assurance have you, that your sins have been remitted?" 60 i .!.  &#xD;<pb n="594-595" xml:id="VAC8270-00000300"/> t 94      LEANDEB HALL. "I have this assurance, Doctor, and a very good one, too, viz: Tht I have been commanded to believe and be baptized for the remission of sins. I have done both, and I believe that my sins are pardoned." "And in which, you trust in baptism for the remission?" "Yes, I am told to do so." "And you believe, also, that had you not been bap- tized, your' sins would never have been pardoned, don't you?" "Oh yes; I never could have felt at ease unless I had obeyed." '  "Then the merit of your salvation lies in the act of your obedience-in your own works?" "I donl't klow that it does-at least Hdon't believe that is the proper source of salvation," stammered Mr. Mayfield, perceiving his delicate situation. "No, Mr. Mayfield, it-is not. It is the merit of the blood of Christ, whch saves us. Baptism lias no more to do with the remission of sins, than I lhave, only it is an act that declares aor death to sin. You are relying on tlhe merit of baptism, though, for your salvation. You have not looked to the cross, and the cross alone, for suc- cor, but you hlave been, anid are still, grasping at em- blems for substances. Baptism to us, is but an emblem of our death to sill, as prefigured by Christ, in true merit, on the cross, and in the sellcllre. If we depend on the emblem ilnstead of the meritorious blood of the Saviour, tlhen our salvattion lies in nierit of our ownl woks." t"But, Doctor," protested Mr. Mayfield, strenuously, "we lre told to be bapltized for the remission of Bins." "I know itMr. IMajfield, and that is what I have been contendingi fer." "Youl?" "Yes, me. I say baptism is a declaration of our death to sin. When we are told to be baptized for the remis- sion of our sils, it means nothing more than we must be baptized because our sins. have been remitted, and we ought to declare by the emblem which Christ has give" -of his death and resurrection, and of our spiritual death and resurrection." Mr. Maytield thought that it looked very much that way, but still he protested. "Why, sir, Peter tells us that we are saved by bap- tism,"    THE INVESTIGATION.        595 "IIe says that as water saved Noah and his family. Now do you believe it wat the water, or God's power?" "God's power, of course." "Yes, and he draws the salvation of water under a  FIGURE! do you remember it? Mr. Mayfield did. "And then he says, our baptism is a figure like it! do you remenber it?"  "Yes, I know he speaks of it as a figure."  "And what would you make it a figure of?" "A figure of our salvation." "Just so. Bapti-sm is a figure, an emblemof our death to sin, and resurrection to a new life. Then it is a figure, of our salvation. Figures are never the real substances, thi. we all 1know."  Mr. Maytield was silent. Dr. Boon continued:  "I know, Mr. Mayfield, exactly wlicre you stand, and how you stand, but perhaps I cannot describe-your posi- tion, as well as I know it. You profess to believe in Jesus, inasnmuchl as you believe that he is the Christ. The' vilest sinner in the land does not dispute that fact, and yet, his belief avails nothing, as he does not lore that 'aviour; and he canInot until his depraved nature is changed.  Now, I want to ask you a question, and I want you to ponder well beforeyou answer. Do you love the Saviour, insomuch that no sacrifice would be too grcat to be made for lhim? or 1o you obey from fear of eternal condemna- tion? Which is it?" Mr. Mayfield reflected. 'lie replied: "You knlow, Doctor, ecery body serves God firom-fear.  If it were not for fear of punishment, we all would restt quiutly in our sins, without ever trying to obey God." "And you are now tlring to obey, because you fear the. consequence of 'non-obedience."             '1 "Yes, sir, that is the nature of mankind." -  "Sir, I protest against such an opinion. I know that was not the incentive which led me to true obedience. I loved God, and wanted to obey all of his commandments, not because I saw or thought of the whys, or wherefores, but because he commanded, and my love for him, prompt- ed obedience to him.  Sir, in truth, fear, does -not cause the Christian to obey, it is love.

No man has ever served God from fear, effectually. God will not accept such services. If you have thought to save yourself from condemnation, by obedience through fear, yours is a selfish obedience, consequently will not be accepted. You are not serving him in earnest, and you are depending on external obe- dience for real godly service. In short, you. are trying to save yourself, byyour-own acts, independently of God, and from selfish motives altogether. This is not the service of the: true lover. God never suffers his people to serve him that way. He worketh in us to will, and to do his good pleasure. He makes us to serve him because we love him, and he makes us to feel that his interest is ours. But I ask you now, Mr. Mayfield, since you have obeyed exter- nally, what incentive influences you to work for the ad- vancement of the cause?" "Because, I do not want other people to get before us," he replied, hastily.  "Still, a selfish motive, and still an unchristian princi- ple. God does not influence his children to work in his vineyard for triumph, but because they love to do his work. You are striving for conquest over other Churches, but his people strive for conquest over the Devil. I tell you, Mr. Mayfield, as long as your Church denies the in- fluence of the Holy Spirit, it will ever be running into absurdity. You may build the finest Churches, and have large congregations, but such external evidences are not the legitimate fruits of the love of Christ, shed abroad in our hearts."  "You -are very unreasonable, Doctor, in such deduc- tions. How are you to judge for us?" "From my own experience. I have stood in the same position which you now occupy, and have had the same feelings. Nothing but the miraculous workings of God, ever called me from hence. I know, sir, my motives for obedience, also for the interest felt it our Church. I had ever in view the aggrandizement of our Chureh only. Every contribution I made, was made to that purpose. I tell you, sir, every Church thus actuated must fall. I would entreat you,Mr. Mayfield, to pause ere you go farther. Look what vast consequences rest on the deci- sion. Sir, I testify of what I know."   THUB IVBStrCOTAiO. -- off Mr. Mayfield remained silent.  "Allow me," continued the Doctor, to ask you. a few 1 questions. Did you ever doubt but that Jesus was the Christ?.  "I cannot say that I did," he replied, hesitatingly. "id you perceive any change in that faith in the act of baptism?" "No," was the positive answer. "Wherein then do you consider your sins remitted? You say that your faith, previous to baptism, and since then were the same. You say that you felt no change in sentiment wherein then consists this passing from dark- ness into light?" "iIdon't believe that there is any such a change." "And yet we are told that there is. Paul speaks of it as passing 'from darkness unto light,' or 'We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them.' Now observe, Paul uses the word create, which is emphatic and unequivocal in its meaning. The language admits of no cavil. David also prayed, ' Create il me a clean heart O, God' &amp;c. Paul again^ speaks of a chge, a radical change-one that interpolation of words cannot gainsay. He says God saves us 'by the washing of re- eneration, and renewing (now mark the word,) of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ.' Now, this influence you deny,-what assu- rance have you of pardon?" "Because I have been baptized." "Was not Simon the sorcerer baptized too?" Of cours  e he was." "And believed too, you will admit." "Yes, we are told that he believed." "And Peter told him that he was 'in the gall of bit- terness, and the bond of iniquity.' What was the dif. ference between his faith and yours?" Mr. Mayfield was silent again. "Let me tell you," continued the Doctor, "his faith was but the assent of the mind, he was still depraved. unforgiven, and incapable of-loving. God. And so are  you. You have merely given an- assent to an assertion, and that belief has not changed you one particle. You need not start my friend, I know this, therefore, I implore you to reflect well on your condition."  &#xD;<pb n="598-599" xml:id="VAC8270-00000302"/> 5i      tLZA iDEP HAL L. Mr. Mayfield muttered something, but it was inaudible, so Dr. Boon proceeded. "You say that you do not believe in a change. If man were not so depraved, such doctrine miglt- be re- ceived, but our nature is such, that somle influence is needed, and it must be of a renewing character to make us willing to serve God." "W hat influence, Doctor? Doesthe Spirittear us into pieces, and then make us over again? What an a)bsurd idlea! : ridiculed Mr. Mayfield, in a most unpleasant tonle. Dr. Boon was on the, eve of elosing the conversation at once, but he remembered his friend's lost condition, and continued. "Such an idea is indeed ridiculous, Mr. Mayfield, but you know tlit we do not hold with such views, at all. Our Saviour answers your question beautifully. Hear it: "' The wind bloweth where it listeth, and tihou hearestf the sound thereof, but canst not tell from whence it cometh, and whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of the Spirit.' "It is a mystery indeed. We feel the effects, and yet we cannot'give the reason wly. Believe me, my friei)l, this is no delusion, and I would entreat you, in iltat be- lief, look well to this matter, for it is of vital importalnce. If you err in this, all is lost. This is ildeed a tfllda- melital, and if neglected, other appenldages are of no avail." "I think, Doctor, you are really fanatical in your re- ligions views. Your doctrine calnnot be mnade head, iolr tail of. I can't perceive the nature of tlis cllange. A religion which a man cannot understand,is certainly not designed for man."  "Do you understand the theory?" "I think I do, but (if there be any,) the change I can't come at." "No wonder." "Why?" "Do you remember, what I told you a few monthl ago?-" "No; what was it?" That the natural man cannot receive the things of the Spirit. Your blindness is easily accounted for. But yol are not exercised, why slould -Iexhort you?"   THE INVESTIGATION.        599 "Well here's my road, so we must part, and had better too, I reckon, as we cannot agree. Good-night," said Mr. Mayfield, as he willingly turned off. ,! The winds sent their cutting voices ahead of a snow cloud, which lowered itself over -the broad panarama of the Ohio. -Dr. Boon involuntarily shrugged his sho'ul- ders, for the blast penetrated the depths of his well lined overcoat, in spite of its extra padding. He had some distance to walk yet, in the which time he became very meditative. The pale moon also threw a bioad cast ray on his countenance, which was anything but wreathed in smiles. Dr. Boon was thinking deeply for his friend. And he might have been praying too, for aught we know, for a sigh almost stifled by the relentless winds, escaped his bosom, and glided away on the current air. The tramp through the snow must have beeni laborious; and unpleasant, but the weight on his mind, was more en- gaging, and monopolized his thoughts, entircly. CHAPTER XLII1.

For the benefit of all, however, histo- ry will be condensed, and the references thereof, will be given, in order to authenticate assertions, and to estab- lish them beyond cavil. It must be understood, that it is not the design of this convocation to endeavor to prove the declaration, that Baptists have existed from the days ot the Apostles, for our enemies have already testified of this beyond doubt: the purpose, of this investigation now, is to trace just some of the strug- gles and suffering of our predecessors, leaving eternity to disclose the rest, and eternity alone, will, for no mortal's pen, can half portray the persecutions of the Baptists!" Mr. Weston, as usual, opened the exercise. "In the distant land of Palestine, where the heathen Turk roams at pleasure, and the lion crouches in his lair, scarcely molested by man-where the rolling Jordan, lisps to the breezes, a requiem of the past--where the wilder- ness of Judea, spreads her untented wings over the birth-spot of sacred memories, whose orient life, leads us back to the primeval days of time-in this retreat, in the deeply embedded forest, where only the untamed of earth tread, over eighteen centuries ago, there came a nman, clothed in canlel's hair, preachinig Jesus, and cry- ing--' Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' "Behold! he who stepped between the wrath of God and man, comes from Galilee, unto John, and asks to be baptized! Methinks I see the unworthy mendicant on his knees, pleading-' I have need to be baptized of THEE, and comest thou to me?' But the meek and lowly Jesus, whose mission vas to dq tte will of the Father, gently commanded-' Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.' Hence he of whom Crea- tion first dreampt, establishes the dividing line between the world and Church, to which he afterwards promises his eternal vigilance. And now Christ has come, the ' king- dom of heaven' is in our midst, against which the gates of hell are not to prevail! 'Tis of that kingdom we would speak, and hold up to the scrutinizing gaze, its un- burnished features, unscathed by fires of persecution. Though, from the days of John the Baptist, that kingdom las suffered violence, it stands as the rock of ages, un- fledged by the moss of decay, or unmoved by the rend- ing revolutions which have directed, unabatedly their ar, tillory at it4 foundation.   THE INVESTIGATION.         001   ; "In its first age or century, the Apostles proclaimed it, an account of which we have in the Acts, but their day finally wound to a close, to be succeeded by men, unii- spiredl, but regenerated by the Spirit of God. Thus it prospered until the lapse of two ages, when innovations began to make inroads on the pure, divine, and unexaml- pled government of some of these organic bodies. But God would not suffer it to be thus, for he raised up men, who contelded in the synagogues and by-places, for the purity of the Gospel, untrnmmeled and untarnished by the whins of men, and ullchanged by the pagan governnlint that then existed. To tills attest, Dr. Riehiard Davis, Bishop of Monmouth, Mr. Edwrlids, the author of the HistoIry of Redemption, together with Mosheim, Zinguli- us, Ypleig, Durmont, Cardinal Hossius, D'Aubigne, ald many other writers and historians, whose names would take up too nmuch space. "Thiou1gh corUipt ons at this age, were daily growi ng in the Chulrch, tiley, (the Christians.) strictly adlered to Church independence.  During the rise and growth of thesl unwholesonie doctrines, there were Churches un-  tarnished by them, hlowever, whose locality' was in the country, where ambition in strife tfr office or power of changiing laws, was unlknown. These Churches still clung to the law pnd the testimony. lu the struggles of twilight, history faintly glimmer-  ing, as the chrlonicler's peii essays to tread this path, a creplueculine view of the followers of Jesus, to the es-  chelwing of mani's innovations, is to be Seen, winding brightly along the first century, and then dimly along the  second, as uhe)lld partly by one MONTANUS, wlio tore lim- - self away from a communuity tlat was fast becoming car- nalized, atd proclainling the Gospel, in true evangelical  style.

"The Novatianists never were in communion with lome. (Mosheim.) They practiced anabaptism, amid the nost horrible persecution to which any people were ever alled to experience; also they resisted the Catholics' ef- brts of amalgamation, almost to their extermination. Rob. Res. p. 440.) This joint move of Tertullian was aade in the first of the third century, the time when ana- ,aptism began in force, as stated by Zuingulius, the Swiss Isformer, who said: 'The institution of anibaptism is to novelty, but for 1300 years has caused great disturb- nce in the Church ' "For a while, let us trace these people to whom Tertul- ian became attached. 'We are told that they were so igid in their discipline, that the Church soon bore the eproach of PURITANS, of which -we have an aceount of uccession, continuing to the present day!" "Do you mean the Baptists, as successors? asked Dr. soon. "Yes, the Baptists are the legitimate successors of the rovatianists, who we4e the PRIMTIVE BAPTISS! and An- baptists, and those who kept the ordinances as delivered. Through those darlk ages of popery, our Church wore aany names, such as Donatists, Paterines, Novatianists, 'aulicians, Albigenses, &amp;c.; but all historians agree that he doctrine they advocated was the same, their names esulting from some distinguished teacher, or locality of iabitation. THEY WERE ALL ANABAPTISTS! We will now race the term Novatianist, more particularly, uuntil we nd them drifted from their present name into another. " As early as 254, these Dissenters (from the corrupt 5hurch) are complained of as having infected France vith their doctrines, (Mezeray's Hist. p. 4,) as were in he Albigensian Churches, where the same severity of dis- ipline is traced and reprobated.

Their soundness of doctrine, their piety, humbleness of spirit, suggested to him the idea of uni-? ting them with the Catholic Church, but to this, they strenuously objected, and afterwards many of them sealed their adherence to the testimony of Jesus, with their blood. In 331, he changed his sentiments towards these people, and they were involved with other denominlatio;ns, in still greater distress and sufferings. Their books Mwere ( taken from them and burnt, and their assemblage wa.:; forbidden. Constantine's strictures became so oppressive, that many fled to more retired spots. Claudius Seyssel, the popish archbishop, traces the origin of the Waldenses to one LEO, who came to the Valleys about that time, from Italy, and unquestionably a Puritan, or Novatian-  ist. (Facts opp. to Fict. p. 37.) In 352, Constantine sent a regular body of troops against these inroocent people,l but they armed themselves with implementsof husband-'  i ry, and put to flight-their enemy, in defense of their homes. "In Alexandria, several Novatian Churches were estab. lished as early as 410, and in 412, Cyril was ordained of the Catholic Church in-that city. He soon began to op.- pose the Novationists by shutting up their Churches, and depriving them of other things. Also, deattli was the penalty of anabaptism, even to the subject, or the adlmin- istmtor! But this is but a slight mark of our persecli- tions; the testimony of Jesus-was to be kept with blood,. and sealed with blood. These persecutions led many of these faithful witnesses to abandon the city, and take ref'- uge in the Valleys of Piedmont, their names being changed lc to Waldenscs. (Bap. Mag. vol. 1, p. 256, as quoted Dby  Orchard.)  "When Constantine took the Church under his foster- ing care, prior to his expulsion, the dominant party began, to be called the Catholic Chlurch, while the Novatiallists, were termed the'-Church of martyrs.

Dr. Allix says that-' It was by means of the Pu- ritans, that the truth was preserved in the diocesses of Milan and Turin.' "In the eigth and ninth centuries, historians say, that they increased rapidly, and were termed, in conjunction with the Paulicians and others, Dissents, or Paterines, be- cause they suffered for the truth so willingly. (French Hi-st. p. 287.) In 1040, the Paterines became so numerous and conspicuons at Milan, that the Catholic clergy took lnotice, and ordered their Churches to be taken from them, so they met secretly in private houses, to worship. The period of their emigration is impossible to fix exactly, but about the middle of the eleventlh century they began to settle in Lombardy, Insubria, and in process of time they seltt colonies to almost all otLer proviices of Europe. About this period,'one ARNOLD, of Brescia, arose as -a greatReformer. He joined himself to the Paterines, and became a considerable help to them, but in 1155, this no- ble champion was seized and burnt, and his ashes thrown into the river Tiber! The dawn of the thirteenth cen- tury, found the persecutions of the Paterines so oppres- sive that they fled from tleir homes, and, as Mosheim says, 'Spread like an inundation throughout the European provinces, but- Gernmany in particular afordred an-asytum., where they were calletd Gazari, instead of Cathari, (Puri- tans,') (or Paterines.) A few years later, an edict was issued by the Pope to this effect-' We shall not suffer these zoretchs to live,' meaning the Paterines, distingnished by many other names. The edict declared that all those. to whom the Pope chose to show favor, were to have their' tongues pulled out, while others were to be committed to the flames'! (Allix's Pied., p. 297.) These were, indeed, , the witnesses of Jesus!--' Persecuted but not forsaken; cast down but not destroyed.'  'Thourgh these severe measures were continued for years, they could not extirpate the Puritans, for God would not be left without witnesses, since he said the gates of hell should not overcome his Church! We find them peopling the earth again, in the middle of this cen. tlry, and 'they had,' sayss Reiner, 'four thlousand mem- bers in the perfect class, but those called disciples were an innumerable multitude.'  (Wall's History, p. 246.)   THE INVESTIGATION.         605  Such were the persecutions in the thirteenth century, that most of these sufferers fled from Italy into other coun- tries, and became incorporated with the Waldeuses, and  the Baptists of other names, which we will trace as brief- ly as possible. &amp; "In Africa, there existed another class called the DoN- ATISTS, after a celebrated leader by the name of DONATUS, who renounced the Catholic body about the first innova- tions, on the grounds of purity of communion.  The Donatists were very much like the Novatianists; indeed, their doctrine was the same, as far as we ealn learn, o0ly their nanles differed, wlhicll resulted fronm the lhabitationl of different sections, and from the most influential teaell- ers tlereof. Crispin, a French historian, cllares them as agreeing iy the fllowingi particulars : 1st, folr I'urity of Clhurch membershlp , declaring that none should be- long to the Churclh, but believers; 2d, in Chlrchl disci- pline, and the purity tlereof; 3d, in independenlcy of each Chllrch; and 4tlh, in relbaptizing those coniilig to them fiont otlher parties, wherein any (tefect was to be seen. O'sinader said, ' Our modern Anabcrptists were , the same as the Donatists of old.' And the voice of all of of our enemies comes up, and declares that Anabal:tists, of all classes and names, were the same, AND ARE 1ENT- CAL WIT[T THE BAPTIST CHURCH OF THS AGE!  ' We will proceed to notice some of the .persccutions of the Dontists, and as we do so, our hearts are ma:de to rejoice, at the faithfulness of our p{redecessors, antd sor- row, as their dark' persecutions are plassing befilre thle view, while partial history dimly reflects such scenes. For three successive centuries, the Catholics persecu ted these people, so industriously, that many were forced to leave their native homes, and flee to Spain and Itily. The vales of Armenia, more particularly, firnished an asyl .:; for these soldiers of the cross. A few years of rest here  and the ' WOMAN' renewed her efforts of extermination, and the Donatists were forced to take up their abodes in caves and dens, and amid the tall mountains, for which they obtained the name of MOTENSES. (Mosheim.)

Spain, became  crimsoned with the life-tide of the Baptists! But faithful to their Saviour, they suffered death by the sword and fire, in preference to life, in Mystic Babylon! And here, hecatombs of blood, baptizing altars in the crimson stream, almost ob- scures the faint view of the Donatists, and the bleeding remnant in the eighth century, became incorporated with other Baptists, more particularly with the PAULICIANS. "Catholics, tyrannical and merciless, stigmatized other Baptists of the first centuries with taunlting names. The Paulicians, or as some termed them, Paterines, were a peo-, ple of similar habits, and maintained tihe samie doctrine as the Donatists! From the gleanings of Neander and, Moshein, we learn that they were about the first to raise the voice against innovations, and against nixing up Ju- daism with the QCristian Church. Identical with the Novatianists,-and other Puritans, history places tlem, in epithetic mockery with other Anabaptists who ' infected' 'the country, and caused such great 'disturbances' from the dawm of the third century. (Zuingulius.) We" will merely notice some of the persecutions heaped on these people, and pass on. "The ninth century witnessed their dire inflictments, as issuing from the empress Theodora, who, though a woman, was possessed of a heart of a vulture. Previous- ly to tlis period, however, they were compelled to emi- grate into France, and even here, many were'caJled to at- test their devotion fand purity with their blood. The em- peror, with the clergymen, exerted their bitterest zeal against this peculiar ,:lass; which, however, proved fruit- less in their extermination. ' Nor could all their power, and all their barbarity,' says Mosheim, ' exhaust the patience, nor conquer% theu obstinacy of that inflexible people, who pos- sessed a fortitude worthy of a better cause'!!! I would ask, what better cause could be found, thain that of preserving the purity of the truths of Jesus? Mosheim, thougl, was one of our bitterest enemies, sono better could be ex- pected of him. "In 845, the Empress Theodora, followed her prede- cessors' examples, and the Paulicans, together with other Petorines, were called to endure still greater sufferings   THE INVESTIGA TION.        68-7 Says Orchard, in his history of the Baptists, 'Her decrees were severe, but the cruelty with which they were put in execution by her officers, was horrible beyond expres- sion. Mountains and hills were covered with inhabitants. Her sanguinary inquisitors explored the cities and moun-  tains in lesser Asia. After confiscating the goods and  property of one hundred thousand of the people the owners of that inumber, were put to death, in the most barbarous manner, and nade to expire slowly under a variety of the most exquisite tortures. The flatterers of the Em-  i press boast of having extirpated in nine years, that num- ber of Paulicians'!!! Still another identifying feature of the Baptists! 'ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND' of our people sealed their testimony of Jesus, in the short period of nine yealrs! ' ow long, O Lord, holy and true,' dost thou - not judge and avenge our blood up them that dwell in the earth?' Rev. vi: 10: Surely these are those who 'were slain for the word of God.' These people were also forced to leave their native homes, and some settled  in Thrace, disseminating their doctrines on the European soil.     .              - : "In 975, history represents them as gaining considera- ble strength, and during that century, they spread. them- selves throuoghout several provinces. Afterwards, they 1removed into Italy and became extremely troublesome to Roman pontiffs. ' From Italy,' says Mosheim, 'the Pauli- cians sent colonies into almost all other provinces of Europe,  and formed gradually a considerable number of religious as-  semblies, who adhered to their doctrine, and who realized every opposition and indignity from the popes.' "About the middle of the eleventh century, many settled in Lombardy, Insubria, and at Milan. In Italy, they were called Paterini, (the same of the Novationists,) and iu France they were chiefly called Albigenses, from the town of Alby in Upper Languedoc." "One question Bro. Weston," interrupted Dr. Boon. "Were the Paulicians,Donatists, and the .Novatianists, all termed Paterines?"  "Yes, the word -signified something equivalent to martyrdom, which these people were so often called, to suffer, for contending for the purity of the Gospel,."' "Then they were all certainly Baptists."

In 1181, Lucius "I., issued a deeree thus: ' We declare all Catharists, (a iame given some of the Baptists,) Paterinee, Poor of Lyons, Passignes, Josephists, Arnoldists, to lie under a perpetualtanathema.' These inltolerant proceedings, to- gether with many other persecutions; drove these )cople into the Pyrenean mountains, and to take up residences in Spain. "In 1193, the Pope sent two legates into France, arm- ed with the most sanguinary and nlllbounded latitude of power. Writhout pity or mercy, Guy and Reiner, (the commissioners,) executed many of these innocent people, for a succession of years, and by the 13th century, the persecutions against them grew beyond desclription. A for- midable army now, of cross-bearers, was amassed against the Baptists of every name, being ternmed lERETICS! And Simon de Montford, Earl of Leicester, atn Englislinhan, headed this armny! In the short space of tiwo months, two hun2dred thotsacnd lives were sacrlificed, accompanied with barbarities before unheard of. This was dore by the approbation of Innocent the 3d. (See Lon. Elnc.) These were our brethren whlo liad 'finiished their testi- mony,' and were killed. But it is not to be understood that all Baptists perished then. Other countries were settled by thenl, as wearing other iamles. Still many of this country fled from their homes, barely making their escape, and some succeeded in getti ig into other piov- inces. Some who were caught, had their eyes p)lncked out, and suffered other cruelties, shocking to thinlk of! All here we behold the Baptists descending the stream of time, crimsoned with their own blood, drawnl friom their veins by the Mother of Harlots. On the 22d of July of this age, ever to be remembered in the history of Baptists, the Crusadors took possession of the castle of Minerva. The Baptists were assembled-the women in one house and the men in another-on their knees in supplication and prayer, and awaitinig with resignationl their faite. A learned abbot began to preach repentance to them, but they simultaneously cried(, 'We lhave re- nounced the Church of Rome--we will have none of y our faithl; your labor is in vain; for neitlher death not life will make us renounce the opillions that we lhave enl- braced.' Upon which, a huge pile 'of wood was pre-   TUB  INVESTIGATION.       609 pared, and the abbot cried, ' Be converted to the Catholic faith, or ascend this pile.' But none were moved, choos- ing martyrdom in the flames, to life in Babylon. Surely, "'In her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.'-Rev. xviii: 24. "To what Church belonged these saints? To the Methodist? I N ! for it never has lost one drop of blood in 'the defence of truth! To the Presbyterian? No! for it has shed ten times more of the saints' blood than it lost itself; neither has it ever contended for the purity of God's laws. To the Episcopal? No! for it too las  gloried in -the persecution of the saints, with other chl- dren of Babylon, and also' unprovoked, it hlas gluttoned its vitisted appetite on the ilnnocent 'Ieerctics,' of every age since its origin, and truly belongs to bloody Baby-Ion, or else Babylon does not contain all thCe tlood of the saints! Then the Baptist (hurch is the only one that can anstwer to the call. Yes, they are the saints slain for the testi- timony of Jesus; they are the only people that ever weltered in their own gore, innocently! and have battled in the faith, since the days of the Apostles! And it can truly be said, ' TIIE BIPTI!TS IMAY BE CONzIDERED THE ONLY CH!U-TIAN CO;:i:'uU:y WHCH IHAS STOOD SINCE THE APOS- TLES!!' Alh me! 1'Vow unlwortlhy are we to claim such predecessors. But to their history. "Scarcely had our Deople ole moment of rest, cro another crusade was mtlstered to reolco all pllaces even suspected of heresy. This .\was in 1211. Tho shedding   j of much blood was the conseque lce, though not to their full extent of expectation. The Paulicianlannd Albigen- ses now, with other Baptists, were forced again 'into Languedoc in the beginning of the 13th century, where they enjoyed a short respite. But in 1221, the Church was drowlned again in blood; the race becanie almost ex- tinctj their examples of piety and holiness-ceased to in- fluence the community in which they lived since their great reverses. Although nearly extinct, a bleeding rem- nant escaped to the western world, and was preserved  there for a while from the dire persecutions of the Wo- man clothed iln scarlet'!

And during the nighlt, which was so severe, that these unprotected refll- gees told a tale which should,ever ring in their persecu- tors ears for, ' When the nqiht had passed away, there were found in their cradles, or lying upon the snow, four.-score of their infants, deprived of life! many of theiri mothers were dead by their side, and others just on the point of expiring!!

"Although many of the Baptists conformed thb Tis banner of reformation, there were those who reptidiaied this conmp:romise bitterly. In 'the valleys of Dauphine, there were Churches which held their assemblies sepa- rately and indel:endently, not yielding in one iota, to the subtle persuasions of these hierarchists. These wxBre af-- terwards driven from their homes by the Pope, and maly /were executed without mercy! (Mosh. Hist. vol. iii: p. 295.) And these ware our brethren, who .kept the commandments of oui' Saviour, and preserved his law, inviolate, for which they suffered death! Surely that 'woman' can thirst for our blood but a little while longer. ' In 1655, the Baptists were called again, to other per- secutions of a most shocking character. The watch-word of everyN sect, was to exterminate these heretics! Popes, legates, inquisitors. subordinates, reformers, and all, join- ed in the hue, 'Let us arise and put down anabaptism and anti-pedobaptism.' "Yes, the ' mother' marshalled her 'harlots,' under. this bannerl-of abomination,' and sought our extermination  But God did not suffer it to be so, for he still preserved. a bleeding remnant, even from amidst this fiery trial, to worship him, according to his laws.

And well did they appreciated this boon, for nearly a half ccutirry of continual persecutions, had caught them how to estimate the blessing of peace.

We only begin at this period, in order to trace them quickly to America's shlores. However, in the vale Carleon, the Welsh Baptists, ever claimed to have preserved a succes- sion from the apostolic days, as we have before stated, and Thomas, the author of their history, intimates that they had good grounds for claiming the above. Let the voice of t1istory speak, as we trace them: ' ( A company af about thirty men and women attract- ed the attention of the Government, by the singularity of their religious practices and opinions. They were appre- hended and brought before the council of the Clergy, at Oxford. Being interrogated about their religion, their teacher named Gerard, a man of learning, announced in their name , that they were Christians, and believed the doctrines of the Apostles. Upon a more particular in- quiry, it was found that they denied several of the receiv- ed doctrines of the Church, and, refusing to abandon their damnable heresies, they were condemned, as incorri- gible heretics. and ldelivered to the secular arm, to be punished. The king, (Henry II,) at the instigation of the clergy, co)mmended them to be branded with a red-hot iron on their forceheads, whipped through the streets of Oxford, and having their clothes cut short at their girdles, to be turned into the open fields, all persons being forbidden to afford them any shelter or relief, under the' severest pen-  alties. This cruel sentence was executed with the ut- most rigor, and, it being the depth of winter, all these unhappy persons were pressed with cold and hunger.' (Henry's Hist. of Great Brit.) "But is this allt No; other historians give further evi- dence of the assertion of the historian just quoted, to-  gether with abundant testimony of these people being  Baptists. Soon they were called Lollards, as a way of stigma, and then, after Wickliffe arose with his pure prin-  ciples, and joined them in their noble efforts, the former name was lost, partially, in the adoption of Wikli7 -   t ites! Whether these Baptists were those who had al- ways lived on Britain's soil, or whether they were a small body that escaped from France or Italy, during their per- secution in those countries, history is not positive, but they were Baptists, that is one thing certain.

Yes front the Avon to the Tiber, the voice of exterminlation went up, and many of the Baptists, under the nanec of Wickliffites, Lollards, Heretics, &amp;e., were' cailed to seal their testimony with their blood.

"But," interrupted 'Dr. Boon, "You promised to give an outline of the doctrine advocated by these people." "So I will; I had almost forgotten it. You remember that the Novatians, Donatists, Monatists, Paulicians, Cathari, the 'poor men of Lyons,' Petrobrussians, and the. Vaudois, were all brought under the head of Wal- denses; some in the twelvth century, in the Piedmont Valley, though in other regions, some of the people main- tained their old nanes."  "Yes, I remember the incorporation of these people about that time; proceed with your testimony." Then we have only the doctrine of the Waldenses to investigate ." "And the Albigenses." reminded Dr. Boon. " No; the Albigenses you remember, in Piedmont, were brought under the head of the Waldenses, too, when they were forced to leave their native bomes.- The Al- bigenses were a part of the Paulician3, named thus be- cause tley resided in a town called Alby, in upper Lan- guedoc." "Yes, I remember; proceed, and let us see the resem- blance between those people and the Baptists of this day .' "Before doing this, allow me to give evidence of the 52  &#xD;<pb n="618-619" xml:id="VAC8270-00000312"/> "8'      ,jEAN)DER  HALL. identity of the Alhigenses, Donatists, Novatianists, Mon. atists, Vaudois, Puritans, Paterines, Lionists, Petrobrussians, Arnoldits, .Jerengaria s, and the Paulicians, with the Waldenses. I would cite you to Mosheim, Allix, Jones, Wall, Platina, Mezeriy, and Danvers, Fuller the Ecclesi- astical historian, Gibbons, Wall, together witl other his- torians of renown. All testifying substantially that the Waldenses, had the above classes as their ancestors. Now, let some of their bitterest elenmies speak for them, in, re- gard to their doctrines. Bernard a renown Abbot, says that the Waldenses, administered babtism only to adults, and that only on a profession of faith in the Redeemer, (Facts opp. to Fic- tion, p. 21.)- Peter, Abbot of Clugiy, wrote against the Waldenses, because they denied infant baptism. (Ivimey's Hist. of Eng . Bap.) Alexander III, condemned the Wal- deuces, lleaping on them the bitterest of denunciations, because they refused to. baptize infants. And the Poor men of LyoTns, were persecuted and derided, and termed Anabaptists, because they would bdptize those coming to them from the Catholic Church, declaring by that act, such had not been cripturally baptized, because Ibaptized in infancy. (Danvers on Bap.) I might quote a hundred authors to prove that the Baptists of all ages, hlave de- nied infant baptism, at the risk of their lives, and prac- tised anabaptismn under the same consequences, which certainly resulted in the execution of the threats issued from tleir enemies.: To arrange this under a more sys- tematic form, I'will say, first;- "ie 7lc Wasleses were antipedobaptists! "As proof references, I will give you Allix's Ch. Pied., p. 140; Walli's Hist., pt. 2, 228; Danvlcrs on Bap., p. 298; Joecs' Lcct., vol. 2, p. 240; Allix's Ch. Albig., c. 15, p. 183; Facts opp. to Fict., p. 42; Jones' Hist. of Christ's Cli., pret. to 5th ed., as given by Orchard in his history of the Baptists. In fact, all historians agree that these pcole were lwhholly averse to infant baptislm, and denied it at the stake,- where they were called bv bishops and prelates to pay the penalty of their devotion to the truth. By referring to the different places cited, you will see from renowned autho, that tills is true. Indeed, their refusing this rite has ever been the principal cause of their persecutions. Infant baptism and oppression have ever gone hand in hand.   ' THE i VE SIGATION.      619 "The Waldenses 'were Anabaptists-that is, they bap-  tized or re-baptized those coming from the Catholic Church, or from other denominations where they thought any imperfection existed in the rite. I hardly need give you references to prove this, but will cite some, neverthe- less. Zuingulius, together with Mosheim, Durmont, Ypeigf, Cardinal llossius, Hume and Gibbon, (all our en- ernies,) tell us that there were Anabaptists as early as 225!  and from thence up to the period of their writing, and at which time, other historians arose to attest to this fact. Bossuet, Dauvers, Perrin, Mezeray, Reiner, Limborch,l Allix, Leger, Moreland, Maclean, Gilly, Sims, Bogue,  Bennet, Osiander, Fuller and Wall, declare without qual- ification, that the Waldenses were Anabaptists!-that they re-baptized those coming to them from the Catholic Church! virtually renouncing infant baptism.- Nor have any of the above writers ever been able to produce one case of infant baptism, among this people! Their refus-  ing this, thereby denying the Roman Catholic authority to baptize, caused, as we have seen, much bloodshed. "The Waldenses were immersionists!  "This cannot be denied. Indeed the antiquated bap- tisteries found attached to their Churches, prove this. Wall, in his history of infant baptism, say's that the Wal-  denses immersed only. No one has ever disputed this, as sprinkling was never considered valid until pope Stephen II., in his banishment, admitted by his authority, that it  would do.  Mosheim, Waddington, Neander, Perrin, Newton, Allix, Maclean, Gilly, Sims, Usher, Collier, and all Pedobaptist writers, agree that immersion was the primitive mode, and was the only mode practiced by the Waldenses. The testimony of many of these we have before quoted, when examining the origin of sprinkling. "The Waldensian Churches were independent govern. ments! "There was no super-ecclesiastical tribunal acknowl- (edged in these Churches. Each little Church was an in- dependent establishment. They took for their motto-  : Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst.' To this attest Neander, 'errin, Osiander, Bernard, Wall, with a host of other historians, who were opposed to them. Even Mosheim desciibes a class of this nature, which could not have '  &#xD;<pb n="620-621" xml:id="VAC8270-00000313"/> 620    R   LEBAN D 1B VUHALL. been his Church, nor the Catholic Church, and whieh could be identified with the Anabaptists, or: Waldenses, only! They repudiated hierarchy, and when Luther arose as a Reformer, his influence might have become boundless, had not he still adlered to the hierarchal prinii- ciples then in force. Luther hated anabaptism, and sought to rule, therefore he was not ap)proved of by the Waldenses, in a general sense, Such Doctor," enlcd Mr. Weston, "were the features of the Baptists in the bitter- est days of their persecutions, and such are- the features of them now. It was Baptist principles that first incul- cated the idea of freedom of speech, and freedom of wor- shiping God according to the dictates of conscience. It was from their Church government, that, the form of the ,constitution of the United States was conceived of, and even now, they would be persecuted by the Church as united--with the State, were it not for the agis thrown around them, resulting from their ownt sentiments. You must not start, Mr. Semms, Pedobaptists would persecute anti-pedobaptists now, if -they could gain the legal au- thority to do so. As I have before said, inffant baptism and despotism have ever qone hand in hand. History amply confirms my statement." Mr. Semms knew that this was true, and he could but cringe under the withering effects of truth. Preacher Sampson, who had maintained a profound si- lence, only gave an-"Ahem!" signifying that though he were not instrumental in these persecutions, he did not like the sound of Baptist listory, drawn in contrast with that of the Reformation of 1804. "Now, Bro. Weston," interrupted Dr. Boon, "I: am ready to hear you proceed with the Baptists' persecutions of the Western world, since I am convinled that the Waidenses were our predecessors." "Which I will do, Doctor, with deep emotions of pain, for in tracing further their history, we are brought to view many outrages imposed on these innocent peo- ple, which should make every Pedobaptist in this land, blush. In the seventeenth century, the persecutions of our people in/ England were so severe, as I. have before stated, that many fled to the wilds of America, to wor- ship God in the deep embedded forest, where no eye, save Deity's, could behold their devotions. They were   TH E INV  S TI A-T I:0:N.     621' not like the' Pharisees, who selected high places to pray in, but they sought the most retired spots of earth, even amidst the jungle of the wild beast, and in sight of the lion's lair, where oppressions resulting from the union of Church and State, could not so easily reach them. The, bleak wild forest of Virginia, furnished a retreat for the blood-stained recoi'd of these people. Baptists, yes Bap- tists, hunted like the hart, first trod the soil of this State, pleading in their gore for soul-liberty, and Christian bap- tiism. Dr. Mathser, one of their bitterest foes, says- ' SOME OF THE FIRST PLANTERS IN NEN' ENGLAND WERE BAP- r  ISTs'! --loing, yes, long before Roger Williams ever set his foot on that soil, these down-trodden and persecuted people, had sought an asylum in the Western world, there to erect a standard of soul-freedom. But in vain were their efforts, for the Woman, still arrayed inl her opposing garb of priestly ambition, followed closely in the track of this retreat, with inquisitorial power, still inflicting wounds at every step. Afterwards, toger Williams came, a tfugitive from persecutions and tyranny, and settled in an obscute province, where he also raised a banner of liberty,' and stamped himself upon its rising institutions in characters so deep, that the impress has remained to the pres- ent day, and can never be erased.' (Bancroft.)  "Th le Anabaptists increased and spread so in Massa- chusetts, that the following act for their suppression, was  led to: 'FORASMUCH, As experience hath plentifully and often proved that the Anabaptists have been the infectors of persons in the matters of religion, and the troubles of Churches in all places where they have been; and thlat they who have held the baptizing of infants, unlowful,- have usually held other errors therewith; and whereas, divers of this kind have, since our coming into New Eng- land, appeared among ourselves, and if they should be connived at, by us, are likely to be increased among us, it is ordered and agreed, that if any person or persons, within this jurisdiction, shall either openly condemn or oppose the baptizing of infants, or go about secretly to seduce others from the approbation or use thereof, or pur-  posely depart from the congregation at the administra- tion of the ordinance-every such person or persons, shall be subject to banishment'!!!!!

If oni earth destroyed, they are not in heaven. Time may obliterate tleir mem- ory on earth, but the minute is taken elsewhere! Pedo- baptism, not satisfied with our blood in foreign climes, has pursued us hither, with the swprd unsheathed, for total extermination. One year previously to this, a poor man by the name of Painter,' says Mr. Hubbard,' was suddenly turned Anabaptist; and having a child born, would not suffer his wife to carry it to be baptized. He was complained of for this to the court, and enjoined by them to suffer his child to be baptized. But poor Painter had the misfortune to dissent, both fronm the -Chuirch and court. He told them that infant baptism was an anti-christian ordinance, FOR WHCH HE AWAS TIED  UP AND WHPPED!' Trace infant baptism where you may, and there you will find oppres- sion and tyranny, following closely at its heals! Allow me to read another act which should cause a blush of shame to mantle the cheeks of every Pedobaptist in the land. This was passed by the VIRGINIA Legislature! ' WHEREAS, Sundry and diveers persons, out of adverse- ness to the established orthodox religion, bor out of new fangled conceits of their own heretical inventions, refuse to have their children baptized; be it enacted, that whosoever shall rrefuse, when he might carry his child to a lawful minister within the country, shall be fined two hundred pounds of tobacco, half' to the informer, and half to the parish.' "What a blur on Virginia's record! Thoughl the State has by noble deeds, wiped out the stain long ago, it wil ever hang on the shoulders of Ped obaptists, as an additional heat to the fire of compunction, as fed by fuel of such dark perpetrations! Other persecutions followed, too numerous to mention. Baptists were taxed tosup- port Pedobaptists' parishes! Their lands were sold when those taxes were not forthcoming! Imprisonment and d(ath also occurred, and the fanatical enemies, maddened by the repudiation of Pedobaptism, rushed headlon g on these innocent people, and perpetrated scenes of blood and strife, prohibiting the right of worshipping God, only as the harlots of that mother, chose to dictate. But we -must forget all this-we must even forget the cause of our persecutions-the extended differences between   THE INVESTIGATIOs.         62  us-the illegal enforcements of our oppressors-ltheir origin--their parentage-their birth in the gates"of B,;b- ' ylon, and assemble together around the Lord's aTble, to cornl mune, in order that we may be PO PULAR!

Surely, mcnll .i ve 'itching ears,' ad 'their hearts tlirst after pleasing thngs,  and the Church of God must work to please the world instead of him who called it 'my Church,' and said that the gates of hell should not prevail against it! Ah the folly of mankind.  ' One more event of our Western persecutions, and I am done, but I'have not recorded half, no not one fourth; eternity- alone will exhibit that record. Though sullen obscurity now binds events to oblivion, the wheel of time will soon roll on to its final destination, and deeds now forgotten, will be resurrected one by one, until the Heav- ens will be lurid with this blaze of crimson hue, dyed in the heart's blood of the persecuted Baptists! Yes, our -enemies may rest quietly on their oars at present, scarce- ly conscious of the past, but the day is coming, when the events, smothered by efforts of popularity, will anise in double force, and the enactors thereof, will stand aghast in confusion and mortification, when contemplating the panorama. America, though the asylum of the downtrod- den followers of Jesus, has also stained her verdant fields of- artless apparel, with the innocent blood of these people. Even now, her garments, are carrying the smell of fire, for her record, like a spectre, arises to resus-  citate memory, in the tints of the dark and gloomy en- actments of the past. But to proceed: "Between 1769, and 1775, nmany Baptists were impris- oned for their religious sentiments. One instance we shall relate, and close. Three Baptist preachers 'were ar- raigned before the court. An indictment had been- is- sued against them forfpreacning the gospel of God, in the colony of Virginia! These were Lewis Craig, Joseph Craig and Aron Bledsoe, whose names are deeply written on the pages of Baptist history, and whose ashes repose beneath the soil of Kentucky. A writer gives the fol-. lowing account of the scene as occurred in the Court House: 4"The clerk was reading the indictment in a slow and  formal manner, when as he pronounced the crime witht.  &#xD;<pb n="624-625" xml:id="VAC8270-00000315"/> 624 L4EA N        a Br:a. L .- emphasis-' For preaching the gospel of theSon of -God,' a plain dressed man who had just rode up to the Court House, entered and took his seat within the bar. He was known to the court and lawyers, but a stranger to the mass of spectators, who had gathered on the occasion. This was PATRICK HENRY, who, on hearing ot this pros- ecution, had rode some fifty or sixty miles from his resi- dence in Hanover county, to volunteer his services in their defense. He listened to the further reading of the indictment with marked attention, the first sentence of which, that had caught his ear, was, ' For, preaching the gospel of the Son of God.' When, it was finished, and the prosecuting attorhey had submitted a few remarks, Henry arose, reached out his hand and received the paper, and addressed the court: M"May it please your Worships: I think I heard read by the prosecutor, as I entered this house the paper I now hold in my hand. If I have rightly- understood, the king's attorney of this colony, has framed an indict- ment for the purpose of arraigning and punishing by im- prisonment, three inoffensive persons before the bar of this court, for a crime of great magnittude-as disturbers of the peace. May it please the court, what did I hear? Did I hear-it distinctly, or was it a mistake of my own? Did I hear an expression, as if a crime, that these men, whom your worships are about to try for a misdemeanor, are charged with what?'--and continuing in a low sol- emn heavy tone, 'For preaching the gospel of the Son of God!' Pausing, amidst the. most profound' silence, and breathless astonishment, he slowly waved the paper tlree times around his head, when lifting his hands and eyes to Heaven, with peculiar and- impressive energy, he ex- claimed: '( GEAT GOD!' The exclamation-the action-- the burst of feeling from the audience, were all overpow- ering. Mr. Henry resumed: "May it please your worships--There arc periods in the history of mal, when corruption and depravity, lhave so long debased the human character, that man silnks unll- der the weight.6f" the oppressor's hand, and becomes his servile, his abject slave; he licks the hand that smites him; he bows in passive obedience to the mandates of the despot, and in this' state. of servility he receives his fetters of perpetual bondage.'

Were it not for this, in vain have beell the efforts and sacrifices of the colonists; in vain were all their suffer- ings and bloodshed to subjugate this new world, if we, their offsprillns, must still be oppressed and persecuted. "'But, may it please your worships, permit me to in- quire, once more, for lwhat are these men about to be tried? This paper says,' For preaching the Gospel of the Son of God.' Great God!

We have hero another earnest protest against that 'raionali tio pirituAl- /   SECOND COMNG OF CHRIST.  nlug of the Holy 8eriptures, which has drifted the Church of Christ so far from the primitive faith. It is a book which shcws the growing interest upon the great theme of the coming and kingdom of our Saviour, now so neaf at hand, and which iillcontribute wholegomely to increase that inter. eot, and to dis eminate information aa to what od's purposes are. We we.. eome it among the num(rous books that are from time to time appearing, and by which the slumbering Church and world are bing called to look at what is coming upon the earth. Mr. Waller believes that the world's great crisis is upon us; and that the lines of the prophetic periods, terminating with the end of this and the beginning of the millennial age, all converge to a point only a few years in the future. He thinks we may date the com- mencement of the glorious millennial Sabbatic rest abot the year 1868. He agrees in this with a large number of the students of prophecy, in this country and Europe.
