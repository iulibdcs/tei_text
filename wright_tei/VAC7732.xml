"Look here, upon this picture, and on this i The counterfeit presentment of two brothers." HAMLET. "THE h-hilal  s and vales of pleasant Maryland," quoth a correspondent of the. London Times. And we, to whom those hills and vales are home, respond amen devoutly. Driving down the broad country road, near the Bay shore of one of the middle counties of this State, perhaps a quarter of a century ago, you would have passed an old-fashioned stone mansion, on a slight, eneminence, a little back from the highway. Far away in every direction were stretched the goodly acres pertaining to it,--fields of yellow corn and green tobacco. In the rear of the; house, at some distance from it, lay the comfortable negro quarter, speaking truly of the peace and plenty shared by all in this es- tablishment, down to the very dogs'that lay dozing upon thq piazza, too fat and lazy to whisk away the flies that tormented them upon that hot, drowsy after- noon.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7732-00000004"/> 8         OPPORTUNITY. From the tall gate, opening on the public highway, the gravelled carriage-road wound its devious course up to the house; enclosed, at irregular intervals, by bits of loose laurel and lilac hedge and rows of pines and larches. But every now and then came, on either side, an uninterrupted sweep of greensward, and, shading it, great, stately, solitary oaks. About midway between the gate and the house stood what was called by pre-eminence " the Oak." Of magnifi- cent height and breadth, its tangled roots formed nat- ural seats and couches, while its low-lying branches seemed to Close you in from the outer world. Here the shade was coolest and greenest, and by contrast the surrounding sunshine brightest and most glowing; here the drowsy hum of the bees and the sweet song of the birds appeared at this season never totally to cease; here, lying upon the waltm earth, you seemed to hear the very grass grow, the flowers -bloom, the grapes swell, the corn fill, the young trees stretch out their roots for a firmer footing; you listened to :a- ture's great working hymn of praise. Here, upon this particular afternoon, lay a figure outwardly as indolent as the dogs aforesaid. Glancing carelessly at it, you would have said, and said truly, - "can ugly, awkward country boy." But look again, and more closely this time, not with an eye to the present, but to the future. The figure is now what you -are conscientiously compelled to call t" long "; a few years hence you will call it "tall." Now he   It           OPPORTUNITY.         9 neither knows how to walk nor sit, in the conventional sense of those words; when he shall have learned to do so to perfection, you will see how well-formed are the limbs and shoulders; as, when he learns to dress, you will know how much grace these ill-fitting clothes hide. Even at present the hands and feet speak for themselves in their almost too great delicacy. The f&amp;ce, as it lies there with its closed 4yes, and bare, boy- ishi look, is undeniably plain. P-The hair that falls across the rather low brow is dark and soft, but worn at just an unbecoming length. TThe short, squarish nose and chill are certainly not handsome, but they are of the shape most harmonlious with the long dark mustache which will one day shade them. Showing a face with the eyes shut is an injustice which ought to be done to no human countenance. If he were to open his now, yoVu would see a pair of eyes disproportionately large for the face, apparently without whites, and in this shade a dead, expressionless black, but which the sun- shine dancing upon the grass outside could light up into golden hazel. But he does not open his eyes. He lies there as he has lain for more than hour, per- fectly motionless and idle. No other occupation has brought him out', no closed book lies near, not even an extinguished pipe or cigar. His only employments a dreamy sensation of the time and place. The truth was, this boy was of the poetic temperament, without possessing the poetic faculty; having the bodybut not the brains of a poet. Were he tenl years older, and - 1*i &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7732-00000005"/> 10        OPPORTUNITY. had his intellect corresponded to his physique, he would. blave joined the train of this generation's supersensu- ous poets; as it was, he was a representativ e of that immense class of young persons who have given those writers their readers and their popularity. Waves of vague sadness and bliss, such as only poets and lovers know, seemed to flow through and over him, with no more definite cause than this sunshine and shade, the glory of this summer afternoon. As it were, inarticu- late poetry pervaded his whole consciousness, or rather unconsciousness; for he did not in the least compre- liend what so-affected him. The hours crept on, the sun dropped slowly down towards the low dark line of hill behind the house; but he did not rouse himself to turn and look at the golden splendor with which it Was tingeing the distant outline. The evening shades were beginning to fall, and the long summer twilight to hint of its coming, when the click of the opening gate was heard through the stillness} unnoticed though by him. Then the measured tread upon the gravel of a horse slowly approaching. The bend of the road brought both horse and rider in view. A rather ugly old man upon a very handsome old horse, but with a curious stately self-consciousness about both which agreed ad- mirably, and told thiat they had long been accustomed to each other. Small in figure, with a face of hlard- featured, Scotch homeliness, there was gentleman, conservative, and aristocrat written in every fibre of   OPPORTUNITY.        1  the man. It was sufficient to look at him to know that here was one who would stand by his own to the very death, -would perish for a point of honor. "Serve God and honor the king " were evidently to him com- mands equally binding; or at least a republican trans- lation of the latter injunction. Honesty, shrewd sense, and humor were in the face; but withal a certain narrowness and hardness, which is apt to go with concentration, a constitutional incapacity for compre- hending or tolerating anything outside of his own experience. The very fashion of his clothes, strictly. retaining that which had been in vogue in his -youth, indicated his dislike of change and his contempt for the opinions of others. As he came round the turn of the road, he caught sigh!t of his son lying as he had done all the afternoon. A quick, impatient motion of the head, and a jerk of the bridle which would have startled any'other than the old horse accustomed to his humors, told how the sight provoked him. "' There 's that boy, lying there again like a sick dog," he muttered to himself. "I cannot understand what pleasure a rational creature can find in it. Why, he is not even smoking!"Which- would have seemed a considerable mitigation to the old gentleman, as bringing the situation so much nearer his comprehen- sion. A little while before, in passing a small creekl he had seen a cow standing knee-deep in the water, under the shade of a tree. He remembered it now;   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7732-00000006"/> 12        OPPORTUNITY. and comparing the two, found them, according to his standard, very much upon a level. It neveroccurred to him that it could be any more an intellectual enjoy- ment in one than in the other. It seemed to him vc!- untarily degrading one's self to-the likeness and qual- ity of an idle animal. But it was not as a kingle action that it so annoyed him, but as a sample of a nature and character so different from his own that it amazed and confounded him. ( "He never wanted to lie about idly under trees all day when he was young; therefore," he argued; " why should his son want to do so? Whly could n't lie sit up on the piazza in one of those comfortable rocking- chairs, out of the way of insects and rheumatism, and smoke and look at the crops growing? An extremely suitable occupation for a respectable country gentle- mar. Or, if that were too old for him, why did n't bhe ride, or fish, or visit; anything but lying about under hedges and trees like some strolling pedler or grind- ing organ-man. It was not reputable. None of his ancestors had ever conducted themselves in that way; therefore, why should he?" All this the old gentleman said to himself in distinct sentences, which was his fashion of thinking, using the Latinized English which is the vernacular of Southerr gentlemen, especially of the past generation. By thii time he was on a line with his son. "Gralame," he called, in a tone into which, thougl neither loud nor harsh, there crept, perhaps uncon sciou'sly, some of his annoyed feeling.   OPPORTUNITY.         ] The boy seemed to understand it perfectly; for he rose and came forward, not hesitatingly, but with an evidently intentional slowness, and with a sort of pas- sive protest in his rather sullen manner.  ' Had nh't you better come in, my son?" asked the father, with that perfect courtesy which he invariably I gave to others and demanded for himself. , ' The boy's only answer was to turn and walk by the side of his father's horse up to the house. The piazza had now other occupants beside the dogs. Rocking Slowly to and fro sat a portly, handsome, commonplace-looking, elderly lady, the metamorphosis of a slim, handsome, commonplace, lively girl. The swift, light click of the knitting-needles in the fat, comelv hands was the only sound; and the lady ap- peared well satisfied thit it should be so. Seldom visited by anything so disturbing as ideas, she was far too comfortable to take, the trouble to express them now, had they arrived. Like most Southern country ladies of her age, her knitting was too habitual to re- quire either sight or attention; so both were indolently i T fixed upon the advancing figures of her husband and t son. ' Douglas," she said, at last, "here come your father and brother." The person addressed was sitting on the top step, bending his near-sighted eyes close down to a book. I He glanced indifferently up, and then looked down again.       ' * - K  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7732-00000007"/> "        OPPORTUNITY. Douglas Ferguson was then sixteen years of age; a year younger than his brother, than whom he looked more than a year older. As far as appearance went, it would never have occurred to you that he was either Grahame's ]rother or his mother's son. One thing alone she seemed to have given him, - his height; he was taller ahd far stronger than Grahamne, but awk- ward and uncouth to a singular degree. His face he had inherited straight from his father. The same high cheek-bones, the yellow red hair, now gray of course in the elder man, the irregular nose, and wide mouth, were identical; but the blue eyes, when not drawn up fi'oml difficulty in seeing, were much larger, and the forehead far broader and fuller over those same eyes. But what his father had transmitted to him in greatest perfection was that unmistakable look of an aristocrat. "Here is the making, the blood and bones and brains of a thoroughbred gentleman," was clearly written in the midst of singular homeliness and rough, boyish immaturity. The innate self-possession and simple un- consciousness which he had even then, are the real foundation of the " grand manner " which is occasion- ally met with liere, and which we read of among English gentlemen. 'There was but 0oe delicate point about this great overgrown youth, where nature had suddenly grown nice and finished her work daintily; his hands, though larger and darkened by careless ex- posure to the -sun, were even more finely turned than those of Grahame. t   OPPORTUNITY.        1/ Mr. Ferguson dismounted and stood for several moments giving directions to the servants for the spe. cial care and comfort of his favorite horse. Grahame came straight up on the porch, and, taking notice of no one, threw himself down on a seat, his half-lazy, half- sullen mood and manner still upon him. Presently his father came up the steps. As he passed Douglas he stooped down, and, laying his hand on. his head, rumpled up his hair with a sort of rough caress. "Well, boy, well!" he called to him in cheery salutation. The boy shook himself lilde a big dog, and scrambled to his feet with a great fresh laugh very pleasant to hear. "Well, old gentleman, well!" was his somewhat irreverent reply.  "What have avou been doing this afternoon? Come, give an account of yourself." And taking his father by the shoulders, he settled into  his particular rocking-chair, which no one else ever invaded, hung up his hat in the hall, brought him his footstool, and, having made him generally comfortable, sat down on the steps near his feet. Then the two began talking briskly of what the elder had seen durring his afternoon's tour of inspection ; of how this field of tobacco and that lot of oats were looking, of how such a   servant's cabin must be repaired and another's eggs and chickens paid for; about all of which the s  n seemed to know and care quite as muchl as the father. The conversation was, as usual, car-  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7732-00000008"/> 16    ,    OPPORTUNITY. ried on in the most- unceremonious style, for Douglas always'did and said just what he pleased to his father, who -apparently in. this way balanced the scrupulous respect he required from every one else on the estate. It was plain where the old man's heart was fixed; that he idolized one son, as the mother did the other. In truth, this division of property had grown to be considered a settled fact, to be neither wondered at nor interfered with. "Here comes my son," said the old man fondly, almost unconsciously, as he one day watched the boys, then much smaller, coming home from school. "And here coleis nmy son," exclaimed the mother, with an almost bitter retaliatory emphasis on the pos- sessive pronoun, expressing strange fire and feeling for this slow, dull nature. This was only putting into words that which every day before and since had illustrated in action, aggra- vating to a most unfortunate degree that slight, uncon- scious partiality which every mother feels for hel eldest boy. Of course this placed parents and chil- dren, brother and brother, in a singularly unhealthy relation to each other. The effect-upon the boys was unfortunate enough, but not as iijurious as might- have been expected. With meenrnatures there would have been envy and jealousy in every word and thought; in this case the result was chiefly a break- ing up of all oneness of feeling, or substitution of a sort of cool, manlike friendliness for ordinary, boyish, c   OPPORTUNITY.        17 brothe ly love. But it did not prevent their standing resolutely by each other beyond their home, at school putting shoulder to shoulder the instant outside pres- sure wwas upon them. Yet, after all, this arose more C from what, in men and corporate bodies, we are wont to call sense of honor and esprit du corps, than from any individual devotion. Though Grahame had never shown signs of failing when brought to the test, still this treaty offensive and defensive had originated with and chiefly been executed by Douglas. It was he, who, because he ras big and strong-and ugly, and of a naturally belligerent tendency, had for years done most of Grahame's fighting. Not that the elder boy lacked physical courage, but because such encounters and their concomitants wearied and disgusted him; while the younger decidedly enjoyed them, especially if his antagonist were almost more than his match. It was he who had jumped, clothes on, into a neigh- boring river, and saved his brother's life at the immi- nent risk of his own. But he took away most of the romance and personality of the action by doing nearly the same thing, a few weeks after, for a little pet dog. When the boys reached their own threshold, each took his own course and followed it after their own fashion. Neither knew anything of the other's essen- tial, interior life. Both had friends with whom they were more intimate; though the Scotch reticence which was in their blood prevented any general confi- dential intercourse,- would have done so, even had B  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7732-00000009"/> 18        OPPORTUNITY. they not been too young to have much power to ex- press what was in them. While Douglas and his father had been talking, Mrs. Ferguson had risen, in her slow, cumbrous way, and gone over to Grahame's side, where she stood, tall and handsome, though rather elephantine, softly stroking his shoulder with one of her little fat hands. This woman was commonplace almost'to stupidity) but the deepest philosopher would have failed to read her son's mood and its causes as clearly as she did from the same slight signs. Mrs. Ferguson could not probably have put her idea into words; but she knew that Grahame was thoroughly uncomfortable, and that he and his fattier had been silently jarring upon one another as'usual. So she stood dumbly conveying to him her comprehension and sympathy. But it was a very thankless office. He was almost as resentful towards her for her open condolence, as towards his father for his silent disapprobation. It made him feel like a big baby being offered sugar-plums to stop cry- ing. Besides, he was too well used to being fed upon such confectionery to care for it, - to be even conscious of its sweetness. A proud, sensitive, self-absorbed boy, this clumsy public coddling offended his taste and irritated him as positive ill-usage would not have done. Poor woman; she was getting the reward which a 'fond, injudicious mother generally receives from a spoilt, talented, unconsciously selfish son. To do Grahame justice, he had too much of the instinct of a   OPPORTUNITY.  gentleman not to try to control any outward demon- stration of his humor towards his mother; but he was greatly relieved by the ,announcement of the early country tea. They went into the dining-room, where the table was spread. 'Upon it smoked the crisp waffles, the snowy beaten biscuits, the corn-cakes, the yellow cream and aromatic coffee, which are apt to form the evening meal in this region. Mr. Ferguson said grace in his ,sincerely ceremonious way, and they took their places. The table was laid for four, the boys on op- posite sides; but between Douglas and his father was placed a child's high-chair. Presently the door opened and the most respectable of old colored women- dressed in blue and white Virginia cloth, with a head- handkerchief which was clearly related to Joseph's coat- of many colors -came in, leading a little child in'deep mourning. The effect of this entrance was different upon each. Grahame simply tAok no notice and went on eating his supper. Mrs. Ferguson looked round, and said, in her comfortable, mild way,- "Bring her to the table, Sophy; and Caesar, go and get Miss Rosy's bread and milk."  But Douglas and his father both turned round, as though here were something which was their particu- lar concern. "Come, little pet, and kiss uncle good evening," the old man said, with a caressing gentleness very different from his rough geniality with his son, or his rather patronizing courtesy with others.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7732-00000010"/> 20        OPPORTUNITY. The child dropped her nurse's hand, and came quickly forward to his side, standing, on her diminutive tip-toes to do as she was bid. But as soon as she had done so, she slipped out of his arms and went towards Douglas. The boy lifted her into her chair, and drew her towards him as though she were his peculiar prop- erty. Old Sophy knew perfectly the mortal offence she would have given to both by even offering to ren- der the same service to her little mistress; and indeed the child was seated before she was well across the room. She came and took her stand behind the high chair, because Mrs. Ferguson would have thought the whole domestic structure about to collapse had she not done so; but her office was a sinecure. The bread and milk was another of Mrs. Ferguson's forms and ceremonies. The idea that it should be the evening and morning repast of small children was part of her mental constitution; and so it was regularly brought on the table to preserve the little domestic fiction that in this case her theory had been put into practice.[ Douglas always made a show of breaking the bread into the milk; and then proceeded to feed her from his own plate, with whatever was palatable upon it, aided and abetted therein by his father. "Douglas, how can you do so? You will ruin that child's health," was the mild wail his mother invaria- bly set up; not that she had the least idea of being attended to, but having formed a habit of making this remark she continued it.   OPPORTUNITY.        2 "O no, mother; it will do her good. It will make her strong; won't it Rosy?" the boy would laugh- ingly reply. And Rosy would look smilingly up at him, and nod assent with her little head; as she would have done to any possible proposition he had chosen to make. The child, being very delicate, would, have preferred the bread and milk as far as taste was con- cerned; but had Douglas allowed her to eat'a single meal of it uninterrupted, she would have gone quietly to bed and cried her poor little eyes almost out. Ah me, if love is so much at seven, what will it be at seventeen, at twenty-seven ; if this is the child, think of the woman! Little Rose Carvel, though she called Mr. Ferguson uncle, was his far-away cousin, -a relationship whose claims a northern climate seems to annihilate, but whllich in the States of Maryland and Virginia are held as binding, though no more demonstrable, than a law of honor. She apnd her large fortune had been placed under his care chiefly by circumstances, as no one else was found ambitious to undertake the troublesome responsibility of a child of that age. Left an orphan a year before, the old gentleman had brought her straight home with him from her father's funeral. Her mother had died during her infancy ; so that her recollections of her father and hetresent surrbund- ings were all the child knew or cared for. Though Mrs. Ferguson was very good to her, her kindness wwa only a high degree of the care she bestowed upon the    &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7732-00000011"/> 22        OPPORTUNITY. comfort of all the small a  on the place. Gra- hame generally compromised matters by letting her entirely alone. If she came directly in his way, he was good-natured enough; but she instinctively 'took pains that this should be very seldom. Mr. Ferguson petted and caressed her, all of which she submitted to in a demure little way, and loved him very sincerely in return. But it was only with Douglas that she was entirely at ease,- -was really herself. An immense pity had stirred the boy's heart at the first sight of this tiny, forlorn creature. Anything so unlike himself  filled him with apazed tenderness. He began to try to soothe her as he might a sick canary-bird. At first these advances from a big, ugly boy were to the child's secret terror and surprise; but she soon recog- nized her best friend. In a hundred different ways he entertained and cared for her. When he came home ifrom riding, he would lift her up before him in his strong arms and canter off round the place. If he went down to the quarter, among the servants' houses, she was sure to be hanging on to one hand, a solemn little witness to bargains, gifts, or scoldings, as the case might be. ie would take her into the barn-yard to see the cows milked, -to feed the newly hatched chick- ens and goslings; though this last was a joy mingled with fear, for even his powerful protection could not quite overcome her terror of the paternal roosters and maternal geese. Then he would carry her in his arms through the stables, teaching her to stroke his own 1         :   OPPORTUNITY.        23 horse's neck, and give it an ear of corn. This last accomplishment was only acquired after much in- struction and encouragement; for, at first, the animal's great, open mouth made her invariably shrink back at the critical moment, and hide her head on his shoulder. He made one- of the servants dig up a few feet, of earth, and fence it in, for "'Rosy's garden"; and showed her how to plant morning-glories and radishes, and such like seeds, Mwhose quality of springing up al- most immediately adapts them to a child's patience. Of course, as soon as the Radishes were of the size of needles, she pulled them up to see how they were growing; but, as she instantly planted a fresh crop, to serve them in the sale way, the interest rather increased than flagged. No wonder she loved him so singly and devotedly, for all the pleasure and excite- ment of her life centred round him. She was not a pretty child; she possessed in very small measure the flesh-and-blood attractions of ordi- nary children. She had none of the color and plump- ness which render almost any features attractive at that age.

As you gaze, there begins to dawn upon you a perception of the distance, as great as that of earth from heaven, be- tween prettiness and beauty. This child will have taught you, that what is worthy to be called by the latter high natme is something deeper than color ap freshness, something too subtile and indestructible to depend upon the merely material. But to see all this required eyes as clear and true as those into which they looked. In that whole house- hold, Douglas alone had even an indefinite perception of it. It never occurred to him to think her pretty; but when she sat on his knee and raised her absorbed little face towards his, as he talked of subjects suited to his age rather tlan to hers, as he told her of his pet heroes in history and romance, of noble and daring deeds which men had done, of how lie longed for the time when he was sure he should go and do likewise, - then, when the boy had recovered Lsufficiently from the enthusiasm of his subject to notice anything, he      OPPORTUNITY.         25 would begin to wonder at the child's look; and there would come over him a dim, crude sense of its being something so high as to be almost above his compre- hension. This fashion of talking to Rosy had grown to be a strong habit with him. It was like thinking aloud, and he carried it on with infinitely more refer- ence to the expression of his thoughts and feelings than her understanding of them. It could not offend the mixture of pride and diffidence peculiar to his age and character, that this silent little confidante should see his whole nature laid bare; she could not hurt his vanity by criticism, and there was never a shade of want of sympathy, or even inattention,- to startle him into self-consciousness. Almost every boy has some loving believer who fulfils 'this office towards him, generally either mother or sister; in after-life, it is ladyv-love. and wife. She supplied a want which, in his peculiar position, he would otherwise have felt keenly. Thus, even in these early days, she became to him like another self. Tea being over, the party at the table broke pp, and went their different ways. Grahame sauntered across the lawn,--whither will be explained hereafter. Douglas took up the book he had been previouslyJeading, and made himself com- fortable by the parlor light. Mrs. Ferguson went away to attend to domestic matters and a sick servant. The old gentleman came out on the porch to smoke his evening pipe, and brought Rosy with him. It was  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7732-00000013"/> 26       , OPPORTUNITY. his custom to take her on his lap at this hour, and laugh and talk and sing with her between the whiffs. His knowledge of music was almost confined to the Scotch songs so in vogue in his youth. But his chief faWorites were the Jacobite songs which his father and -grandfather had taught im when he was of this clild's age; those wonderful old songs all about 1"Charlie," Which touch us even now, as generous devotion and singleness of heart and purpose always have power to do, - touch, and almost awe us, as we remember that these are no idle rhymes, but that the love and faith they tell of was proved in prison and exile, on battle- field and block. Through the parlor windows Douglas could hear (and had a pleasant consciousness of it above his in- terest in what he was reading) the mingled laughter of the old man and .the child; the two voices sing- ing, one feeble with age and the other with youth. Neither could do more than turn the tune, but both sung with a simple childlike earnestness which had a curious suitability in it. "I swear by moon and stars ,sae bricht, And the sun that glances early, If I had twenty thousand lives I'd gie them all for Charlie!" he could hear the child's voice uttering with a direct- ness and an habitual clearness of pronunciation which separated it from the old man's confused tones, and gave it the force of personal speech. He smiled in-   I:            OPPORTUNITY.        27 voluntarily at the contrast between the energy of the sentiment and the weakness of the voice; and yet there was a tone in the latter, which, had he under- stood it, would have shown him a similarity between the two greater than the difference. "Good evening, neighbor," called out a cheery voice, which preceded a hale country gentleman, and arrived several minutes before him.  "Ah! is that you, Martin? I was hoping you would come over," said Mr. Ferguson, heartily welcoming the new-come, who came up on the porch, and took one of the rocking-chairs as familiarly as though the house had been his own. He had his lighted pipe in one hand and a folded newspaper in the other. Martin Hall was the owner of the next estate. Ever since he and Mr. Ferguson had married and settled, he had been accustomed to walk over nearly every evening to smoke and talk politics, to oppose the con- tents of his Democratic paper (in which he had that illimitable faith wlhich men only bestow upon a favorite political organ) agaislit Mr. Ferguson's Whig oracle, in which, if possible, that gentleman hiad still greater confidence.  Thus they had wrangled on; the older gentleman losing his temper upon each distinct occa- sion, but regaining it with singular precision as the clock struck ,ten, at which hour they always shook hands heartily and parted. "Still going  on about that everlasting Charlie,' laughed Martin Hall, as he lazily rocked and smoked.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7732-00000014"/> 28-        OP RTUNITY. - I could hear you and Rosy all the way up the walk. I wonder you are not ashamed to teach an honest little republican to sing the praises of those miserable Stu- arts, especially of that wretched Pretender!" "Hush, Martin," said the other, gravely; " don't talk so about a race who, if they had their faults, cer- tainly suffered for them, and for whom b-etter, truer men than either you or I lived and died. Besides, that wretched ' Pretender,' as you call- him, was only fighting for his right."           [ "Yes, there it is! You are always ready to back the romantic, divine rights of rulers against the plain simple rights. of the people," retorted Martin Hall, dodging the particular question, and striking off into a safe sea of generalities. I do nothing of the kind," exclaimed the-old gen-. tleman, testily, beginning already to lose his temper. And then began the inevitable political discussion, until the two adjourned to the parlor, where they talked and read opposing articles- at each other, until poor Douglas found that the next election and the subject of his book were getting mingled in hishead to a distracting degree, and was fain to retreat in disgust.  Leaving his book on the table, he sauntered dorwn the room.   The stone walls of the house were so thick that the windows formed quite deep recesses. In one of these he sat dowzn, out of the way of light and noise. Resting his elbows on the window-sill and   -OPPORTUNITY.  .    - X::k: uhis chin on the palms of his hands, he began by idly watching the fireflies, but gradually fell into a train of boyish thought. Grand rose-colored dreams of j what he was to accomplish in life,- schemes, of which the ends were clear and vivid, but the means very indistinct, - these wonderful imaginings of faith and immaturity were there; but shading and poison- ing them were the recollections of multitudes of petty annoyances, which at his age sting so sharply, when the lesson of disregarding them has yet to be learned. Presently, coming out of his revery, he became con- scious that Rose was standing by lim in her unobtru- sive way. She had slipped outl of Mr. Ferguson's arms as soon as his political discussion. liad begun, knowing from experience that, after that, her presence or absence would be equally unheeded. Since then she had been busily engaged, and had just returned to this part of the house. "' Well, little one!" said the boy, lifting her up, and perching her on his knee, "is Cllarlie asleep? have you put the young Chevalier to bed?" "Yes," she answered, sedately. This titled individual was Rose's pet kitten, which Douglas had rescued in its infancy fronm the watery grave to which it and its brethren were being con- signed, and brought home for her amusement. It had any quantity of names taken from the Jacobite songs the child constantly sung to it, as she nursed it in her arms.

"Is this the Charlie you are going to give your twenty thousand lives for?'" laughed the boy, with an amused reference to what he had heard her singing earlier in the evening. O' O, no!" she answered, quickly, shocked at the suggestion. "Well, for whom would you do all that?" he went on,. rather carelessly. 1But the child, constitutionally conscientious, looked seriously and earnestly at him, as she thought over the question before answering it. "I would do it," she answered slowly, "for Uncle, and- -for you," she added, after a pause almost imperceptible, but which entirely disconnected the two names. The boy's jesting mood passed away in an instant. He took the small, pale face between his hands, and looked down at it with a strange expression in his own. "So you would do it for me?f" he said at last, softly. "Why, Rosy?" "Because," she began, with a sort of still enthusi- asm vibrating through the weak little voice, -" because i-"  But here she hesitated; she thought of his ev- ery-day kindnesses, of the rides and the walks, of the young Chevalier himself, but, young as she was, she vaguely understood the despicable commercial quality of mere gratitude for value received.

'TW ITH  Martin Hall this story has nothing to do; but in his daughter our interest is some- what greater, in that she was Grahame Ferguson's fitst love. If those individuals who renounced the pomps and vanities for Cassandra Hall, and bestowed I her name upon her, could have foreseen her as she now was, they would have shrunk fromn the responsi- bility of the first action and the inappropriateness of the second. Nerves of the very firmest must have felt a shock at hearing this rather stout, jovial young lady called by the name. of that unfortunate prophet- ess, who was so entirely without honor in her own country. Consequently, it had long since been short- ened to Cassie; and under this appellation she had long been known as the prettiest girl in the county, and its most determined coquette. She was at this time twenty-two years of age; having spent the intervening period between this and her sixteenth birthday in making herself agreeable to every man, woman, and child she came near, in enjoying herself to the utmost, and in flirting with every available gentleman she met. In the last few months, she had settled down into an engagement with a fine youhng cousin of hers, whom she had kept in a state of semi-   i            OPPORTUNITY.        33 distraction for the past five -years, and for whom she, had cared very heartily all the while. But, being one of those women whose coquetry ends only with their existence, the present arrange- ment made little difference in her outward course. She was perfectly aware that Grahame Ferguson wor- shipped her at a distance, and she considered it just what was right and proper on his part. She would talk and laugh with hin, would entertain him very good-humoredly when no one was by who was better wqrth the trouble of subjugating. (Even when such was the case, and her chief attention was otherwise- occupied, she had not the least objection to his sitting and staring at her, seeing how white were her hanlds, how pink her cheeks, and how shining her yellow curls. She had been used to this sort of thing all her life, and counted him among the number of silly flies who wei-a always singeing-their wings in the candle of her brightness. Far from feeling  any compunc- tions of conscience, she rather regarded the arrange- 9 ment with an abstract sense of admiration, as another instance of that fit iess of things which Nature always preserves. It was natural for her to play the part of candle; therefore social flies became a relative neces- sity, and were of course provided. It was from this theory, held in perfect sincerity, that her conduct proceeded. Poor Grahame! he never-in all his after- life saw yellow curls, witout a confused inclination to laugh and blush and sigh all together. {x i    &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7732-00000017"/> 84        OPPORTUNITY. It was towards Cassie Hall's home, which, as I have said, was next his own, that he sauntered away every evening. Sometimes, when his-courage was greater than usual, and the general position of things tended to aise it, he would enter, and for the next hour or two talk, listen, or look, as the fair Miss Cassie saw fit to let him. A smile rather sweeter than usual, a soft pressure of her hand at parting, (arrows from her gen- eral armory, the aiming of which at this particular mark she forgot the second after,) would send this boy away in such an ecstatic dream of pure bliss as would have touched Cassie Hall's naturally kind heart, if she could have comprehended it, and made hei careful of gratifying her vanity and love of mischief at such a cost. But by far the greater'number of evenings he spent wandering around in the woods and fields and lanes in sight of her house, dreaming of her, or how she was looking, what she was doing, and, above all, whether any thought of him ever crossed her mind. This boy's love was entirely disinterested. He knew that she was engaged to her cousin, that she*could never love him; all he asked was some chance to prove his devotion, to show her that, had she given him her heart, he would not have been utterly unworthy of it. His brain was always conjuring up situations in which his part was invariably that of her deliverer from danger or sorrow, - catastrophes which generally wound up in his triumphant sacrifice or death for her sake. Some-    iOPPORTUNITY.                    35 times the result was less critical; and he dreamed of living to be a great, noble man, to whom in after-years it would be the crowning honor of her life to point, and say, "He once loved me."  Silly boy-nonsense, mere puppy-love, in the vocabulary of older men; but, reader, look back at the same period in your own life, and say if, since, you have ever been so pure, sod'simple, so unselfish and honest. In after-years, changed as Grahame  Ferguson became, he never spoke of these days, and, though, he might smile, never scoffed at them, even in his heart; feeling for them a sort of tender reverence as something apart from himself, something upon which there rested at least the reflection of those " clouds of gloty," trail- ing which " we come from God, who is our home." But Grahame's happiest day was Sunday. Regu- lal'ly Mr. Ferguson's old-fashioned carriage drove ovel- to the church. In it were always Mr. and Mrs. Fer- guson and Rosy; while the boys rode over on horse- back, as was the fashion with most of the young men of the neighborhood. That old church! Built be- fore the Revolution, with its traditions of British offi- cers worshipping in it during that war, with its brick- floored aisles, its high-backed pews, its modernized pulpit contrasting strangely with its ancient surround- ings, - even as I think of it now, my childish sensa- tions of cold feet and weariness return. Arriving upon the green before the church, Mr.- Ferguson was sure to find congregated there the car- &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7732-00000018"/> 86         OPPORTUNITY. riages and saddle-horses of all the gentry for the sur- rounding ten miles, most of whom traced their lineage through the Revolutionary heroes to the earliest set- tlers of the State, and through them across the water to the old English nobility. Under the trees momen- tarily increasing groups of young men would stand, chatting. There they would watch coach after coach approach, bowing to its occupants as they descended; but with greatly augmented empressement if they hap- pened to be young and pretty, instead of some digni- fied old planter and his equally stately wife. Martin Hall's carriage was almost sure to arrive among the last i and it must be confessed that there were persons who attributed this constantly recurring circumstance to the fair Miss Cassie's coquetry and love of creating a sensation. However this might be, certain it was that she was sure to find a perfect battalion of her admirers drawn up ready to receive her; and that her appearance, looking more bewitching than ever in a killingly becoming bonnet, was the signal for a gen- eral contest as to who should have the honor of assist- ing her to alight. Of course, Grahame, regarded by all as the merest boy, was nowhere in the race; but it was a sort of satisfaction to hang around the outer edge of the group, and watch and envy more fortunate beings.            * Then they would enter the church and the service would 'begin.  "The Lord is in his holy temple." Ah me! I wonder if those words were ever spoken,   OPPORTUNrITY.        37    -      o   ro  rr. when, to almost every young heart which heard them, there was not some one else in the "holy temple " to- wards whom their thoulghts and feelings went out far more earnestly! Then began Grahame's hour of bliss, towards which he looked longingly all the week, and with the hope of which lie fed his hungry heart day by day. Their pews were so situated, that, without attracting attention, he could watch Cassie Hall's pretty profile continually, and see her full face when- ever she turned her headc, which she graciously did from time to time. And thus the boy pampered his foolish passion, and was at once insanely happy and deliciously miserable. This girl may strike the reader as a singular first- love for such a man; but it must be remembered that he was naturally of the temperament, and was now of the age, when propinquity is even a more powerful cause for love than it ordinarily is. Being what, he was, Grahame Ferguson had necessarily sought some goddess to adore; and, investing the nearest pretty girl with her imaginary attributes, he had naturally fallen down and worshipped her.  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7732-00000019"/> 88        OPPORTUNITY. CHAPTER    III. IT had long been decided that, when the education of the boys was sufficiently advanced, they should go to the University of Virginia to complete it. The time for the execution of this purpose having now { arrived, they were to enter at the approaching term. Both looked forward with keen interest and excitement  to the change in their monotonous life, and yet to eaich there was a strong drawhack to the pleasure. With Douglas it was the constantly recurring thought of how greatly his father and Rosy would miss him, added to*  that physical clinging to long-accustomed scenes and faces characteristic of strong, tenacious natures. , With Grahame it was, of course, Cassie Hall.- How he should live from week to week without the hope of that hour of dreamy happiness in the old church was the problem which made both heart and head ache with vain efforts-to solve. Tile result was, that, between his wish to stay and his desire to go, he ' ended characteristically by surrendering himself and his will to the current of outside circumstances. Time passed rapidly, and the beginning of the term saw both father and sons at Charlottesville. "God by, Grahame," said Mr. Ferguson, very kindly, ash eld out his hand to him at parting,   OPPORTUNITY.        39 "Iearn to be a good man, my son, for your mother's sake.-"  "And for your sake," the impulse was strong upon Grahame to answer; but the old passive pride and / want of comprehension between himself and his father kept back any expression of affection now -as always. "Good by, my boy,"' said the old man, turning to Douglas, resting his hand on his shoulder, and looking up in his tall son's face with fond, proud eyes, "be an honorable gentleman for the old name's sake," he ex- claimedo instinctively expressing that ligh-toned pride which was so strong in each breast. "For the old father's sake," broke out the boy, grasping the other's hand, with -the sensitive voice quivering, as did the lips. : Then the old man went his way with dim eyes; and the boys walked silently back to their rooms, Douglas with his mouth held firmly steady. The college life began, and went on month after month. But it gradually became evident that neither of the boys was very much liked in the University. Somehow Grahame Ferguson's fellow-students did not get on with him. Although he was perfectly po- lite, he seemed rather to isolate himself voluntarily, to establish between himself and them the same friendly lack of intimacy which had- so long subsisted be- tween himself and his brother. The fact was, apart from his social position, he belonged to and suited no particular -set. Inferior as he was to nearly all the  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7732-00000020"/> 40        OPPORTUNITY. older ones in knowledge, he was greatly their, elder and superior in taste. Their rough, immature ways and opinions annoyed and disgusted him, and made him avoid the companionship of beings vith whom he fancied he had little in common. He studied enough to hold a barely respectable place, therefore the am-- bitious, hard students of his class would none of him. The emphatically "^ wild set " despised him as a prig and a humbug; and he, -on the other hand, kept sedu- lously away from them. The ' religious set " looked upon him as little better than a heathen, because he spent the greater part of Sunday in sauntering about the surrounding country by. himself, or lounging in his room reading Shelley. As had been the case with his father, he perplexed and annoyed them more by this conduct than he would have done by much worse actions. They had far more mercy for the doings of the wildest students, because they better comprehend- ed them. Besides this, he was vaguely suspected of holding certain " infidel," opinions, -what they were, Heaven only knows! certainly he or they did not,- a suspicion more ruinous to a man's reputation in this particular region than wicked deeds. Thus the first two or three years of Grahame Ferguson's college life were passed rather alone, and rather unl er a cloud. With his brother, the case was different. Douglas Ferguson had a certain lordly way about him, before which persons instinctively gave place; a manner which, had it been less evidently natural, even uncon-     -          -   OPPORTUNITY.        41 scious, would have been called insolent, and made him far more enemies than friends. As it was, people qui- etly accepted it as an essential portion of the man. Added to this, he had the respect which is always granted by his fellows to a young man of high, hot temper, very strong arms, and extreme skill in the use thereof. From the first,. this born aristocrat took his rightful place in the foremost rank. But all this did not render him popular. The truth was, he was care- less, and thoroughly absorbed in his own plans and ideas, which habit and nature made him keep to him- self. He hated a crowd of general acquaintances, who took up his time and tried his patience, and counted himself lucky to have escaped it. He had come there to study hard, and he did it,-treating the large majority of his fellow-students witrt good-natured indifference. This hard studying gave him a great advantage over his brother, in that it not only occu- pied his mind and --time, but gave him a fixed position immediately. The reading men very soon found out that here was some one who belonged to them ; likewise soon discovered that, though neither quick nor brilliant, he had a capacity for downright hard study, for power of absorbing and retaining facts and principles, digest- ing and making them his own, unequalled among his fellow-student-. He seemed to conquer all difficulties by main force. It was not easy, at first, for this to- tally Undisciplined boy to come into rule and measure, and learn to work steadily and systematically. But  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7732-00000021"/> 42        OPPORTUNITY. he accomplished it, and had his reward in many ways. The best men of his class Nwere always more than willing to hear what he had to .say upon any mooted question; and usually examined their premises care- fully before hazarding an opinion at variance with that - of "Di "Ferguson. This was the nickname by which he was known throughout the Universityv. He had caught it afteir this fashion. He was in his room late one afternoon, sitting with his elbows on a table near the window, with his lhands buried in his hair, and a book of tough mathe- matics before him. He had been digging hard at it for a long while, studying against time, and mind and body were worn out and irritated with the strain. There were several others in the room engaged in the same occupation, though by no means at the same rate. Presently GrCaame came sauntering in, -and began idly moving about the room in that aimless way so distracting and apparently inexcusable to one engaged in any employment requiring concentration of thought. After a little, as no one seemed disposed to talk, he thoughtlessly came and stood before the window, lazily enjoying the sunset, entirely forgetful that he diminished the already fading light. Not only the actual inconvenience, but something in the con- trast between his worn-out energy and the other's lux- urious idleness, was to Douglas's patience what the last straw is supposed to be to the camel's back. "For Heaven's sake, Grahame," he cried out, an-   OPPORTUNITY.        43 grily, "do stand out of my light! If you won't study yourself, don't prevent others." ' What a perfect young Diogenes you are, Fergu- son I " laughed one of the students, as Grahame walked silently away; " though your brother is rather a weak specimen to play Alexander to you." From thllat time forth, Douglas's room was called nothing but Sthe tub," and himself Diogenes, soon shortened to "Di." The habit became so -universal, that his rightful name was almost forgotten. Strangers : were introduced to himn by no other title, and went away gravely believing this to be only another instance of the singular taste so often displayed by parents and sponsors. His promise to his father to be "an honorable gen- tleman," Douglas fulfilled day by day. From the very first, this mere boy's haughty contempt and amaze- ment at all that- was coarse and mean made much older men chary of airing such sentiments in his pres- ence. Yet, as time went on, and his shrewd sense and force of character began to be felt, youngsters who got into trouble acquired a fashion of --going to himn to get -.them out, and were apt to come away vowing that -"there never was such a good fellow as that Di Fer- guson!" Absorbed -as they were with their'-present life, neither of -the boys forgot his home.

But after that he visibly recovered; and, before another year had rolled around, his inevitable period of first love had passed safely by, and left him, in his own estima- tion, none the worse. Indeed, he felt quite thankful for the experience it had afforded him, for the trim- ming away of certain youthful follies he: believed it had accomplished. He wrote home semi-occasionally, always addressing his letters to his mother; but, except during the vacations, he held little or no intercourse with the rest of the family. Though Doualas's emotions at leaving had been less acute, they wore much better. Twice a week Mr Ferguson would stand upon the porch, watching ner- vously for the return of the servant from the country post-office, and invariably the expected letter from his son appeared. Then the delighted old man would en- ter the house, and, settling himself in his arm-chair and carefully wiping his spectacles, would proceed to read and re-read these long, genial, hearty epistles. But this was only a preliminary mastering of the sub- ject, a mere foretaste of the pleasures to come. After tea, he would assemble Mrs. Ferguson and Rosy-- this young person being allowed, by his special edict, to sit up an hour later on these particular evenings - around the fire, and read the letters for their benefit. Mrs. Ferguson displayed that degree of interest per-   OPPORTUNITY.        45 fectly compatible with entire physical comfort and un- --interrupted knitting; -but it-was to the littl6 face upon his knee that the old man looked for complete sym- pathy." Hvowthe two laughed over the jokes, whether A the little one -:quite understood them or not! how both faces glowed as they read of. any of his college adven- I  tures! how the eyes of each either sparkled or dimmed as he- told of triumph or trouble! If the boy wrote of any kindness doneo him, their gratitude to the doer w- Was boundless; and they instantly began laying plans practically to exhibit it. They knew all the Profes- sors' nicknames and their peculiarities, as sketched by this boyish, original hand. Douglas's friends and en- i emies were theirs also to a far greater degree. In fact,- they lived his life as thoroughly with him as though tley'had been near him in bodily presence. Every nowand--then, there would come, enclosed in these larger epistles, a small sheet of note-paper, for- mally directed to "Miss Rosy Carvel?; for this big, uncouth boy had enough kindly thought and delicacy of perception to know how much more a child values a whole letter, though but of a few words, all to itself, than it' does the longest. message through some one i else. The glory and pride these little notes were to Rosy, words cannot express. The first evening they came, she invariably took them to bed with her; and I am sure did not sleep half the night from pure ex- citement and delight. Then came the wonderful busi- Iness of answering them. For some time after Doug-  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7732-00000023"/> "        OPPORTUNITY, las's departure, Mr. Ferguson had to guide her hand over the paper, to tell him " how much she loved him, how she was always thinking about him, how funny the young Chevalier was, what beautiful little ducks and chickens were just hatched out in the barn- yard, how, she gave his horse an ear of corn every day, and never forgot it, and how old Sophy sent her best love to Massa Douglas." But love is a marvellous teacher, and very soon the small hand grew indepen- dent and the letters longer, each one much neater 'and. more carefully written than the last, in the diminutive writer's intense ambition to make them worthy of him to whom they were sent. One thing greatly surprised Mr. Ferguson as this college life continued; and that was the moderation of both boys in money matters. Reared with very in- dulgent ideas concerning young men's liberties and pleasures, he considered the cultivation of wild oats at a certain period of life as natural, and as much for older people to make the best of, as childish diseases at an earlier age. "Most of his neiglibors' sons ran heavily into debt while at college, so why should he expect to fare better?" the old gentleman argued, and coolly made up his mind to bear strong demands upon both purse and patience. But the demands never came. Their tastes and habits removed them from or- dinary temptations ; and the fact that no limit had ever been put upon their expenditures reacted into a re- straint. That -which they can have at any moment,   OPPORTUNITY.        47 young people seldom exert themselves very greatly to obtain. Mr. Ferguson fortunately avoided the mistake of so many good parents, --that of surrounding the E world's wickedness by so much mystery, so many bar- riers, that it seems quite a work of courage, romance, and ambition to overcome them; thus unconsciously I tempting their children as much by the good as by the evil in their natures. Added to this, the Scotch blood in the boys' veins brought with it a touch of Scotch economy. But the effect of this economy was characteristically different in each. Douglas saved by butting down his own luxuries, Grallame by diminishing those of others. Douglas would give and lend freely, and then make up E for his generosity by self-denial. If Grahame les- sened his expenses, it was by courteously declining to pay for the extravagances of others, or by dexterously avoiding being taxed for their entertainment. Even  now this boy had set up the standard of his life, had established the line by which he would walk to the end of his davp, - that his comfort and ease were the one necessary thing, with which nothing must ever be allowed to interfere. He was not ill-natured, he in- jured no one intentionally; but whatever stood in the -way of his enjoyment he considered himself justifiable in putting aside, let it be what it might. Perhaps, in the long run, much is hot gained nor saved by this course of conduct; but even thus early he chose, the rule by which he would be guided in his own working- out of the problem of life.  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7732-00000024"/> 48        OPPORTUNITY. So passed, with little or no variation, three years of their lives. About this time, a change, which for somne while had been almost imperceptibly coming over Grahame, began to be visible to those around him. Strangers visiting the town commenced to ask " who that distinguished-looking young man was." Ladies giving him a casual glance were sure to bestow a sec- ond look upon him of decidedly greater interest and respect. Young ladies who came to Commencements teased their brothers, in what they considered a most ynaccountable way, as to who and what he was, whether they knew him well, and dozens of other de- tails which men find so ridiculous when women inquire about men, but not at all so when they are the ques- tioners concerning any member of the opposite sex. So, like the man who carried the calf until it was a cow without noticing the difference, Grahame Ferguson's fellow-students woke up to the fact that he had passed from an awkward country boy to an extremely elegant and striking young man without their perceiving it. Then they did what the world always does to a man who proves successful in any department,- instantly pardoned all early failings and disagreeabilities, recocr- nizing what they had thought inherent faults as mere chrysalisism, only serving to guarantee the genuineness of the present butterfly state. Young men who had previously thought of him merely as "a lazy, odd fellow," or "rather a bore," took to courting his society, to imitating points in his dress and manner.   Grahame occupied perhaps three minutes in arranging his neck-tie; and yet there were men in his class who daily spent hours in vainly endeavoring to copy its negligent grace. They inquired his tailor's name, and, having ordered suits from the same place, were infinitely disgusted to find, upon wearing them, that the effect was entirely different. It was well for Grahame's manner, not only that he had been born a gentleman, but that he possessed such a large amount of lazy phlegm ; otherwise, it would have been ruined by this sudden tide of admiration.    As it was, he remained to all appearance as cool and indifferent to their homage as he had been to their disapprobation. But for all that it had its effect. No man, be he saint or martyr (and this poor fellow was certainly neither), can constantly breathe an atmos- phere of the admiration of his equals without his vanity bringing forth at least thirty or sixty, if not a hundred fold. Vanity has always struck me as greatly resem- bling the measles. If had in extreme youth, and well brought out to the surface, it is abe. harmless disease; but if it is taken later in life and strike inward, noth- ing is more dangerous. This was the form ihwhich it had attacked Grahame, its lack of outward demnonstra- tion being its most alarming symptom. But, strange to say, it did not rid him of a secret diffidence, a want of self-esteem. When among his fellows, he naturally accepted himself at their valua- tion; but occasionally, when alone, when his old, high   &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7732-00000025"/> - 50        OPPORTUNITY. dreams and ambitions returned, somethnc like fits of self-abasement would come over him. But a few hours after all this would be lost in pleasant sensa- tions, caused by the admiration with which some pretty girl would listen to his graceful commonplaces, or by the practical flattery of some 'student's imitation. Gradually these fits of temporary humility became less and less frequent, and finally almost disappeared; especially as he grew to regard them as a species of waking nightmare, the effects of which were to be thrown off as soon as possible. Here this man made his first step downward. He not only gafve up the worship and service of his early gods, but began great- ly to doubt their worthiness, of homage.  Having climbed so very short a distance up the hill Difficulty, he forgot, he distrusted, the shining heights which crown -it, and turned back to the pleasant bowers and easy paths at its foot.   CHAPTER    IV. AT first both boys had regularly spent their va- cations at home. Douglas always continued faithful to this custom; but towards the end Grahame found it pleasanter to accept his numerous invitations to accompany some of his friends to their homes in the lower counties of Virginia. As the close of the last term drew near, the hopes and fears for success became exciting. Among those most conspicuous for distinction were Di Ferguson and his dearest friend, Ridgely Beckwith. They were from the same State, the latter being a Baltimorean. Of course, this chosen friend of Douglas was his exact opposite.  A handsome young fellow, with'a thin, rather sallow face, jet-black hair and eyes, brilliant both physically and mentally. For a given time, -he could .outstrip Douglas with ease, and, had he been able to continue the pace, would utterly have eclipsed him. But there lay his difficulty. Whenever he had done particularly well for a month or so, lie seemed to think himself entitled to a compensating period of idleness. To have made Dougls look up at him, in his genial, admiring way, and say, "Ah, Ridge! if you would only go on like that, you would beat us all," was sufficient glory to make- him rest on his laurels for some time to  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7732-00000026"/> 52         OPPORTUNITY. come. He would cut Greek and Latin, bid good by to mathematics, and take to smoking, reading poetry, and talking it in " the tub," to a degree which would have sorely tried patience, nerves, and friendship less strong than those of Di Ferguson. But whether in the busy or in the idle mood, he was always charming to Douglas, who would willingly have done his study- ing for him, had that been possible. OSh being the state of affairs, it was no wonder that, when the im- portant day arrived, one should succeed, while the other failed. It was no slight thing to Douglas to have gained that for which he had so long striven; but the thought of " poor Ridge " rather took the taste out of his pleasure. Ridge himself, on the other hand, had no such feeling, having long since settled in his own mind what the result would be. Amid all the throng and excitement and applause, the most success- ful man of the day was perhaps the quietest and grav- el; a little flushed in the face, but otherwise as steady as ever, and never deserving hiis sobriquet of Diogenes more thoroughly, as Ridge laughingly told him. Grahame's share in the day's honors had been little less than his brother's; but his claims for consideration were based upon very different grounds. He had barely passed; but, as he had neither- desired nor worked for more, he was qufte content. But there was scarcely a woman, young or old, who had not flattered him by word or look, consciously or unconsciously; there was hardly a visitor, however distinguished, who   \ OPPORTUNITY.        53 had not noticed him in some way. He stood as clearly superior to the others in his own department as his brother did in Ihis; and, whatever he may have thought in after years, he would have then been very loath to exchange with Douglas. The party which started from Charlottesville was a very large one; but it rapidly thinned, as one after another dropped off at his home, until, when they reached Baltimore, there were only the two brothers and Ridge Beckwith left. Here they parted company with the latter, and took the cars for the country sta- tion which was their destination. At last they were at their journey's end, the train stopping just long enough to get rid of them and their trunks in the mof summary-manner; Mr. Ferguison had not been able to come to Charlottesville; but here he was now in the old carriage, leaning through the window, waving his hand in jubilant welcome to his boys. 'Douglas was at his side with almost a single bound, and Grahame was scarcely behind him. e The welcome he- gave them both was so overflowing with love and pleasure, that his old partiality for his younger son seemed for once lost, the distance between Grahame and his father ap- peared for once closed. "Drive on, Jim, drive on quickly i " exclaimed the excited! old gentleman, and very soon they were rolling I up through the laurel hedges, and in a moment more' were ate the porch. Here, of course, stood Mrs. Ferguson, and by her  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7732-00000027"/> 54        OPPORTUNITY. side a slim little figure in white, which Grahame for a moment scarcely recognized. Large, comfortable, and comely as ever, there was an eagerness in the elder lady's manner which was very unusual, and the color was coming and going in her still smooth cheek as in that of a girl. This time Grahame was first to be out, rnd up the steps by the timre Douglas had helped his ather from the carriage. So it was that, his mother being fully occupied with her elder and favorite son, it was the little white figure which first came forward to welcome the younger, -came to him without a word, without a sound, but with a radiance in her face which touched the young man very much, as he stooped to 'kiss her. They met just as they had parted; his long letters and frequent visits having prevented the wide gap which generally has to' be bridged over when friends long parted meet, especially at the age when single years work such great changes. A moment: Douglas was kissing his mother, and Grahame turned to speak to the child. With him the case was different, as he had scarcely been at home for eighteen months. -The look which Douglas's coming had brought into her face was still there. It struck and impressed the man far more than her growth or any other change in her. Gra- hame had naturally an eye for female beauty,- had a perception of its most subtile forms, even when they were beyond his comprehension.   4 ' Why, Rosy, is this you?" he said very kindly, as   he kissed her. "I scarcely knew you. How you have -"  Here he stopped-, looking curiously at her, and findipg no word to express his meaning. Changed," "grown," " developed," -all these words came to' his lips; but they seemed so inapplicable that he could not bring himself to use them. Here was something for which this elegant gentleman, fresh from the seat of learning, knew no name. He turned away after a second or two of hesitation, leaving his sentence un- finished; and Rosy never knew what it was that, in her cousin Grahame's opinion, she had done to such an extent. He went back to his mother, to that mother's evident delight. "My son, my handsome son!" she said, as she softly stroked his shoulder; expressing more by the motion than by the words. The young nan laughed very pleasantly, and put his arm around her with a tenderness which thrilled through this slow nature as nothing else had now power to do. This was very unlike the reception he had given her-ca- resses upon this spot four "years before; and she felt the difference, though she had long ago forgotten the particularscircumstance. Grahame had certainly very much improved in man- ners and temper.  The difference between the silent, rather sulky boy who had left them, and the graciously companion who had returned, was surely very marked; and no wonder those around him counted the altera tion a most desirable one. So Mr. Ferguson thought  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7732-00000028"/> 566        OPPORTUNITY. as they sat at the merry dinner-table, as they strolled over the estate, visiting the familiar spots and greeting the old servants; Rosy hanging to Douglas's hand as of yore, clinging jealously to her accustomed privi- leges. He was delighted at what he considered the wonderful improvement in his son, and plainly showed -it in his manner. Well, deeper readers of character than this gentleman, with better chances for scrutiny, might have been deceived into overlooking the price which had been paid for the change! The young men, on their part, were greatly pleased with their return home, and their welcome to it. "Grahame, I am very glad to come back to the old place," Douglas said that night, as they were going towards their bedrooms. "And so am I. Good night, Di," the other an- , swered; using his brother's nickname, which he never ( did unless he felt unusually kindly and familiar towards him. Already their late college life began to seem far away and shadowy as compared with the new exist- ence, as men of the world, upon which they were entering, -an existence in which each would pass through such varied joys and sorrows.      H           OPPORTUNITY.        57 OPPORTUNITY.        57 CHAPTER     V. THREE years have passed since the day of their leaving college, - three years which have wrought many changes. Both father and mother have been laid in the grave- yard surrounding the old church. The man went first, and the woman almost immediately followed, as though, from necessity, as though her physical life had been derived from that to which she had so long clung for support. Upon Mrs. Ferguson's death, little Rose had been sent to live with an aunt, a fashionable lady, who had speedily disposed of her at a fashionable boarding- school. The child had nearly broken her heart at parting from both the dead and the living, but had submitted passively to whatever they chose to do with her. She made no. appeal to Douglas to let her re- main. She bade him a quiet farewell, which would have done honor to thirty instead..of thirteen; for she saw, poor child! with a sickening heart-aclle, that his thoughts were far away from her. In truth, Douglas's grief for his father was so pas- sionate, so overwhelming, as to really alarm those around him. For months he seemed scarcely to eat or sleep, but went wandering about the lonely house 3*&#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7732-00000029"/> 58'        OPPORTUNITY. and estate like the ghost of his former self. Here his lack of self-control, the want of discipline, both ih na- ture and education, first displayed itself. At last, Ridge Beckwith, who was visiting him, was almost in despair. In this extremity he bethought himself of the family physician, who had known these men from their infancy, and rode over to ask his advice. "Get him away from here as soon as possible," was the answer, promptly given. "Shut up the old house, and carry him where he'll never hear of it for a year or two, and you will bring him back strong and well. I know the boy. Made of good material, butl requires careful handling. Has a temper and heart either one of which may be his ruin any day. Take care what influences and circumstances you let work upon him, for I tell you, if you lead him into temptation, you will have that man's soul and body to answer for; but. above all things get him away." "Thank you!  Good by," said Ridge, and rode away lighter at heart, and seeing his way much more clearly before him. Tile next morning he started for Baltimore, to settle ' with Grahame a plan he arranged in his own mind over night. His idea was that they three should go on a European tour, and that they should start im-. mediately. Ever since leaving college, Grahame had been living in town, under a supposition which his family, and he too, entertained, that he was reading   law. Douglas had been at home during the same period, managing the estate,--leading the country- gentleman life for which he was best fitted, and wlhich he had resolved should always be his. The faithful. old overseer could certainly be left in charge, so there was nothing to keep the young men at home. Ridge Beckwith had nominally kept up some legal- studies in the same great lawyer's office in which Grahame had a place; but these studies had always been of a highly intermittent character, and had never been allowed to interfere with any more pressing business or pleasure. Three young men better able to start away on the spur of the occasion could scarcely be found in this busy country. The idea found such favor lin Gra- hlame's eyes, that between the two men all necessary arrangements were made in a few days. Then they went home to Douglas to explain their plan, and gain his consent. He was in that state in which, had his friend proposed a journey to 'Kamtschatka, he would have agreed, rathler than make the effort to contest the question. So he wearily and listlessly said, "Yes," and they eagerly caught at the promise, and held him to it. The sea-voyage, the excitement, and change of scene, did Douglas infinite good; so that, by the time they reached the Continent, he was, to Ridge's un- bounded pleasure, almost like himself. They had reached Paris late in the autumn, and the winter months passed away charmingly in that gayest of capitals. &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7732-00000030"/> 60        'OPPORTUNITY.        4  They met many friends, old and new,- wandering young Americans, some on, pleasure bent and some on improvement, - with whom Grahame fraternized in- stantly. But Douglas and Ridge, as of old, chiefly affected each other's society. They liked best to go about sight-seeing together, diving into all sorts of unaccustomed places, meeting queer people, seeing odd sights, and deriving an intense entertainment from it all, which Grahame's host of fine friends entirely failed to afford them. Though the brothers had the same lodging, it was not strange that, with their tastes drawing them in such different directions, they saw little of each other. Grahame cultivated society, and aspired to a very fash- ionable set of his own and other countrymen; and it must be confessed that he gained what he sought. Here, as elsewhere, women flattered and admired him. His pleasures were of a much politer order, were far more comme il faut, than those of his brother; -but it is to be greatly doubted whether they were as pure, as capable of being discussed in the presence of good women. Not that Grahame went to any excess. He was certainly too refined a man, and probably too good a one, to enjoy mere sensuality in any form; but, be- ing also a weak man, he took the hue of those around him, among whom he voluntarily placed himself. Had he been cut off from society of his own choosing and situated in La Trappe, he would have followed, for the time, the example of the strongest-minded   OPPORTUNITY.        61 rother of the order. Upon the whole, he would ave liked the discipline for a reasonable length of ime; and would have returned to the world, the flesh, nd the devil, with such a delightful consciousness of irtue as would have justified him in his own eyes in evoting himself to a mild worship of that trinity for ie rest of his days. Men like him rather enjoy what ley consider accumulating a stock of penance and rpentance, while the novelty makes the putkuit easy nd exciting. If religion could be had like an inter- littent fever, a good day and then a bad day, there is large class who would find nothing more pleasant. erhaps theattempt at Christianity many of us " mis- rable sinners " make is after this fashion, without our zing conscious of it. If it were any consolation to rahame to feel that he was no worse than his neigh- rs, and indeed was passively far better than the ma- rity, he had that solace; it was, in fact, the flattering action he laid to his soul whenever that soul made int requirements for higher food than the husks upon hich he was feeding it, whenever the old sense of If-abasement began to stir within him, as it sometimes d when he happened to be thrown with Douglas and idge more than he usually was. He could never ly with them long, without a dreary suspicion rising ithin him that all his success was worse than worth- ss, that he had made a mistake as to what is worth nan's striving after. The chief effect of this was to ike him keep out of their way as much as possible, and  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7732-00000031"/> 62        OPPORTUNITY. devote himself to his own friends and acquaintances, who certainly were not calculated to inspire such emo- tions. True to his invariable rule, he simply avoided whatever occasioned him unpleasant sensations. Living  thus sundered, it seemed quite natural that when, the spring having opened, Douglas ayd Ridge started on a semi-pedestrian tour through Germany and Switzerland, Grahame should stay where he was. He did not rejoin them until the following winter found them at Rome. He was really surprised at his own pleasure at seeing his brother and old friend. The truth was, his companions, with whom he had been living for some months, were beginning to bore him; and he unconsciously added his relief at their absence to his enjoyment of his brother's presence, and carried the sum total to Douglas's account. He was in the good-humor with himself in which it always put him to find that he "6 got on well " with Douglas. It was no small compliment he thus paid his brother, in using him involuntarily as a measure of his rise or fall in character, as a test of his spiritual condition. He was now in the comfortable frame of mind of a man who has felt his moral pulse with a satisfactory result. Such being the case, their sojourn in the Imperial City was delightful to each of them. Grahame fell into their moods and habits with his own curious adaptability. He had never before thought or learned so munch, never before led so high a life. He could scarcely realize that he was the same person who had    OPPORTUNITY.        63 lived in Paris but a few months before, and his exist- ence there seemed dim and unnatural. But when this Italian life was over, and they found themselves once again at the French capital, Grahame began to dis- cover what a strain it had been upon him to keep step at a pace so greatly beyond his own natural one, began to find their atmosphere a little too rare for his constant and continued breathing. The husks of this world had acquired a delicious flavor from long abstinence, and he returned to them with avidity. His good- natured, frivolous friends were delighted to see him and he to meet them. So he went back to his old occu- pation of feeding his mind and heart and soul on chaff; so he began again a life not wicked, but worthless, whose just reproach was, not its positive evil, but its lack of any positive good. It was spring before they were once more within the borders of their native State.  At home again, they gradually settled down into what was to be the rou- tine of their lives for at least some time to come. Ridge went back to his lawyer's office. But though Grahame had intended to do likewise, he put off actual perform- ance so long that it seemed ridiculous to begin, and so his purpose lapsed away. - He soon fell into his accus- tomed society life, naturally taking his place as a leader. Just the old existence, with just the old result,- at first the pleasant sensation and good-humor of pampered vanity, reacting, after a time, into satiety and intense ennui. He had passed through this process several &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7732-00000032"/> "        OPPORTUNITY. times, forming distinct periods in his life; and when- ever, in travelling the circle, he came back to the same point, he could not help feeling that the value received was less and the payment heavier. Living in this city, Grahame was at home, not only by birth, but by nature. Here he entered into a series of' regular flirtations, singling out every girl in his large circle who was distinguished for anything, until it grew to be quite a distinction, sufficient to stamp her as for some reason apart from mediocrity, to say of a lady, "Grahame Ferguson was once attentive to her." He was not particular as to the peculiar style of their attractions; beauty, wit, intellect, fashion, even oddity, anything which ;gave a momentary aim to his life, interested and semi-satisfied him for the time being. During the first freshness it was his business and pleasure, to which he gave the whole of his mind; when it began -to bore him, he would quietly drop the whole affair and pass on. Douglas, immediately on his return, had settled him- self at his old home, which now belonged to him. Mr. Ferguson's will had been a judicious, though rather sin- gular one. The property was divided equally between his sons; but to the younger he had left the homestead and estate surrounding it, knowing-:that every acre, every stone, would have a value to him apart from its worth in dollars and cents, and that it would never go out of the, name and family so long as he -could pre- vent it. To the elder he had given some-contiguous  I   OPPORTU TY.         65 land, on which there -was no- house, making up the dif- ference in value with city property and stocks. There had been sufficient to give each of the young men a com- fortably large income, but not to make them wealthy. Douglas found plenty of occupation, for certain seasons of the year, in- managing his own estate and that part of his brother's property which lay near him. In the autumn Ridge and a set of his intimates always came down to stay with Douglas and shoot. During the ducking season-lhis vicinity to the bay-shore made him extremely popular, and many and gay were the parties made up for a visit of a, week or two to him. He was a famous shot, and enjoyed nothing more than tramping after partridges; or going wet, hungry, and cold all day for the pleasure of making havoc among the canvas-backs and red-heads. As he picked his company, and required not onl]y a good shot but a goods companion in his chosen guests, men were rather flat- tered at receiving his invitation. After Christmas lihe always came up to town for two or three months. The first season Grahame made a most loyal and valiant attempt to introduce and place his brother in his own set, particularly to lionize him among his lady friends; but it would not do. The net amount of boredom was something really frightful, and Douglas utterly rebelled against all future attempts of his brother on his behalf. He betook himself, as of old, to Ridge's lodgings, and they thenceforward became his, head-quarters when in the city. E  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7732-00000033"/> "        OPPORTUNITY. Though the relation with whom Rose Carvel osten- sibly lived resided in Baltimore, Douglas had only met his cousin three times since his returp from Europe; and these interviews had been short, unsatisfactory, and under the surveillance of the older lady, who did not encourage an intimacy which she thought might divert the girl's attention from her studies. The cause of this separation was that for a large part of the year Rose was away at boarding-school, -and during the summer vacations staying at some watering-place; so it was only when she. came home for the short Christ- mas holidays that the young man had been able to see her  .             - Meantime the child was becoming  a woman, having reached her seventeenth year; and Douglas and his brother were-respectively twenty-seven aa twenty- eight  -     OPPORTUNITY.        67 CHAPTER VI.

Politically a violent democrat, -though strictly in the United States seise of that term, -socially an extreme aristocrat, his dis- courses upon these his pet themes were curiousl en-  tertaining. An individual whose energy and earnest- ness seemed all absorbed into his peculiar ideas, leaving him practically and physically lazy, careless, and pur- poseless. Manifold as were his opinions, they were all passions with which he had so managed to mix up his sense of honor, that to differ frommhim was to in- sult him, to excommunicate yourself, according to his sincere belief, from the communion of gentlemen, --a brotherhood more sacred, I am sure, in his creed, than the communion of the saints. Such being the case, he naturally most enjoyed and frequented the companionship of women and young men; those classes in whom by/ge-or nature imagina- tion is stronger than reason; those whom his personal influence utterly blinded to any imperfections in him- self or his logic. In the days when he lived in society, he had always a band of talented male disciples who rotated around him, their common centre. As these grew older, some of them rather graduated beyond him and his doctrines; but they always retained sufficient love for both to prevent their offering more than a smile in reply to rhapsodies upon theories whose falsity they had lived out for themselves. But their places   OPPORTUNITY.        69 'were speedily filled, and so Dr. Dan's circle of- worshippers and his vanity suffered but slight tem- porary injury. Up to his forty-third year, he had done nothing serious ins his existence, -had' aceomplished none of the life's work-set for- the doing of every accountable being, except so far as studying his pro- fession went.  His practising of this profession had been of a sin- gularly spasmodic character.- He would go about en- joying himself generally at springs, cities, watering- places, for perhaps a year or two, when suddenly on   some fine morning    he would appear at the homestead to the astonishment of his old colored housekeeper, and settle down to a regular course of smoking and    reading, disregarding  ordinary meal} confounding day and night, and ignoring the outsie world as thoroughly as if it had no existence.  Gradu- ally the rumor would go through the county, " Dr. Dan has come back." Such was his reputation among his friends for skill, daring, and resource in cases where life hung on a thread, that they were only too glad to send for him whenever he was within reach.    At first he would probably refuse to go, at least would swear a little, -  or, rather, a good deal, - protesting vehemently that he would not put on his boots, that he would not get on his horse and ride five or ten miles, as the case might be, to tell any man how much mercury he needed; for Dr. Dan was of the strictest sect of allopathists, and   having been brought up in a bilious  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7732-00000035"/> 70        OPPORTUNITY. country, stood unwaveringly by his blue pills. How- ever, when his servant, who from frequent rehearsals understood his part perfectly, brought the said boots, the doctor generally condescended to assume them, and when his horse was saddled and at the door he would mount and ride away. What with the excitement of the exercise, and the delightful consciousness of virtue in having sacrificed his own comfort to that of his fellow-being, he was, by the time he reached his patient's house, in so charming a mood, so grand in manner and appearance, that ib generally toolk bhe whole family a week to recover their normal state after his visit. He would keep up this mode of life for perhaps another year or two, until, some new project having been start- ed by his city friends, he was off as suddenly and un- expectedly as he had arrived, neither himself nor any one else being able to say when he would return. All this did very well up to a certain period; but after a time things began to alter. Age commenced its inevitable work upon him. He felt that his love of change and society was de- serting him, that things which he had most keenly relished, now rather wearied and bored him.. -In his recent visits to town, he could not help seeing that the world in which he lived was getting rather beyond him. Though his' old friends clung to him as closely as ever, still a generation had evidently arisen who knew not Joseph, -worse still, who would not have appreciated Joseph had they known him. I suppose it was some   OPPORTUNITY.         71 satisfaction to him to call- them, in his magnificently scornful way, " a parcel of silly boys and girls"; but this did not alter the fact that they were largely in the majority, and that, as a social potentate, he was surely and rapidly going to the wall. He perceived that he was gradually becoming the most uncomfortable, un- classable of beings, - all old young man ; that he was losing his place in one set without gaining it in another of more advanced years. He wondered how other men whom he knew to have^ walked the same road as himself had solved this problem. Bethinking himself of all like examples which his experience afforded, he found that they had invariably followed the same rule, had naturally and gracefully glided out of their diffi- culties by marrying. Thus they had settled comfort- ably into their own place and class, covering their fading glories as the glass of fashion and mould of form with the dignity of paterfamilias. He resolved mentally that he would go and do likewise. Sudden and violent in this as in all his impulses, he atonce got up and dressed himself (for he had thought the matter over while lying in bed late one morning, as was his fashion), deterrmin'ed to-set out without delay upon a tour of inspection -of his available female friends. "It makks very little difference who it is," he mut- tered to himself as he brushed his ionce brown and waving hair, being unconsciously minch strengthened in his resolution by noticing how thin and gray it was  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7732-00000036"/> 72        OPPORTUNITY. turning, "any good-looking, good-lyimored, well-bred woman, whom I shall not be ashamed to see at the head of my table, will o. They are all alike for that matter; it is not I who, after all my experience, would attempt to comprehend them. They are all alike," he repeated, with that secret scorn for the sex which arose, perhaps, in his case, from the slight resistance it had offered to his powers of fascination, but which I have found invariably in the sons of such mothers as his; "except Margaret," he added quickly, after a moment, his voice changing to the simple, affectionate tone of a boy, and he gave a little involuntary depre- cating wave of his hand, as though offering even to her mental image the amende honorable. This Margaret was his half-sister, his only near relative, resembling him in likeness to their father, but with a character very divergent from his where traces of the different mothers appeared. A gentle, womanly woman, who ha. done more to keep alive a faith in God and human- ity in Dr. Dan than all the other influences of his life together. Being in his present frame of mind, the first woman in any degree suitable whom he should meet might, of course, have him if she wished. That very night, at a large assembly, he came to the conclusion that he had found what he sought, and acted accordingly. Sophia Brent has always struck me as being in a certain small way a representative woman; for this reason, as well as for her influence upon more impor- 9   ' p   OPPORTUNITY.        73 tant characters in this story, she deserves some atten- tion. She was a species of the genus old belle. Her life from the age of six having been a series of flirta- tions with appropriate members of the opposite sex, she had nominally entered society at eighteen with a cool, hard knowledge of the world and'its ways which most women are thirty years in gaining, and which some, thank Heaven! never acquire. She imagined that she understood men thoroughly; and she was right, so far as concerned that division of their natures which they all invariably present to women of her stamp. Her demands being unconsciously the same on each, their responses were, of course, identical; she consequently lost the effect and lesson of contrast. The one aim for which she had been trained, and which she kept* ever steadily before her, was the making of a good match. This she followed with a patience, courage, and unfailing self-possession which it really seemed ought to have secured success in any pursuit. Still, year after year passed, and to the astonishment of herself and every one else Sophia Brent was still Sophia Brent. Yet she had apparently every qualification for the game she was playing, every advantage she could ask to begin with. A decidedly pretty face; light-brown hair, whose arranrgement she perfectly understood; features quite regular enough to escape criticism; good, wholesome teeth; a color perhaps a trifle hard and deep, but giving her the appearance of great health and freshness, standing by her wonderfully in the early 4 St  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7732-00000037"/> 74        OPPORTUNITY. morning after the long and late dancing of the previous night. The defects of this countenance were, that the forehead was small, the lower part of the face sugges- tively heavy, and the eyes a pale, unpleasant, ashen- blue. Item: good blood and undeniable position, which she dexterously used to increase the number of her admirers. She would take up young men (handsome and educated, but belonging to a class rather differ- ent from her own), introduce them into her set, and make them quite the fashion, gaining thereby at least their temporary devotion. To be sure, they were apt, after having through her secured a firm footing, to ignore their obligations, and pass on to other and less easy conquests. But she was far too practical a wo- man to quarrel openly with the result which she had learned to look upon as almost inevitable, and went on recruiting her thinned ranks by similar processes. By these ways and means she had made and held her belleship. Mentally and morally she was simply commonplace. Beyond an astonishing dexterity in ac- complishing her ends without being the visible agent, and an almost preternatural apprehension of her own interests, she had small claims to rank as an intellect- ual being. She had a liveliness which passed for wit, as she had a noisy good-humor and love of amusement vhich was mistaken for good-nature. She never did wrong when it was equally her interest to do right, and escaped the power of large temptations through a devout and single-minded selfishness. V    OPPORTUNITY.        75 And yet this woman had once possessed something which at least stood to .her in place of a heart; and thereby in some degree hangs this tale. When Grahame 'Ferguson came as a very young man to live in Baltimore, Sophia was the reigning star of society, and into her hands he naturally fell. The fact of her being on her own ground, and know- ing every one intimately where he was a stranger, gave ,her control over lim for a- considerable time. In arge she was his superior by two or three years, and in worldly Wisdom by a century ; and she well knew how to use her advantages. Then it was that all the emo- tion'al capacity of this narrow, shallow nature was aroused. So far as it was possible for her to love, she loved Grahame Ferguson. Nor was he by any partic- ular effort to gain her attachment, responsible for it; he simply treated her as he did all ladies, visiting familiarly at her, house as did dozens of other young men. She soori saw her mistake, and accepted the situation in her eminently practical way; but then and there died the small chance Sophia Brent ever had of being a good, happy woman. It affected her outwardly very little; she flirted, danced, and sung as before, searching all the while as diligently as ever for'that "good match " which she had made the prize of her high calling. But she was never afterwards quite the same person. She had always been skim-milk, but henceforward she was skim-milk slightly soured. She never could speak  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7732-00000038"/> 76         OPPORTUNITY. cordially of any-of the many other recipients of his smiles and attentions; a dull,-chronic dislike of them possessed her, a settled desire to make them feel un- comfortable, to place them in an unbecoming or, if possible, a ridiculous light. Here her adroitness came in with wonderful effect, enabling her to inflict num- berless stings, without allowing the victim to perceive, except by instinct, wilo had hurt her. This wass the person upon whom, by accident and force of circumstances, Dr. Dan's choice fell. That which she had failed to accomplish by such long schem- ing and toiling had come to her by mere chance, sent -bf some whim of fate. I scarcely know if she were more delighted or amazed when he addressed her. And really to have Dr. Dan Harvey, the unconquerable, the hero of such countless conquests, surrender at last to what she very naturally supposed to be the power of her fascinations, was enough to affect any woman's vanity. For the moment it had the effect of a moral alkali, producing an effervescence, and, correcting in some degree the acidity of her nature. This efferves.. cence, and the excitement of getting ready for her im- mediate marriage, she quite mistook for love, and, not seeing Grahame for sonle time, imagined she had for- gotten him. At last this marriage, a twice nine days' wonder, was consummated, and they came to- live at their country home. Here Dr. Dan settled seriously down to his prac-   OPPORTUNITY.        " tice; a proceeding rendered necessary by the fact that he had never been very wealthy, and that he had treated his, property in the same careless, irregular fashion as the other affairs of his life. He had ob- tained what he had said would content him, -a good- looking, good-humored, well-bred woman; whether he found-his bargain quite satisfactory remained to be seen. All this had happened about two years previous to the time up to which our last chapter brought Gra- hame, Douglas, and Rose; let us now resume our story at the latter period. It was November. The partridges were in their prime, and the canvas-backs had made their appear- ance. Douglas had come to town to gather up his shooting-party for the season.     "If I were you, I would come down immediately," he said to Grahame, as,they sat talking in the latter's apartments on the day before he intended leaving. He had been looking at his brother for the last five minutes, thinking how worn out he seemed, both men- tally and physically, at that early hour in the morning. "I think I shall," Grahame answered slowly, and with that peculiar manner of his that always left Doug- las in doubt as to whether it resulted from weariness or laziness, and which touched or irritated him accord- ingly as the evidence induced him to believe in the one -or the other origin, This morning there was a dull, blank hopelessness in Grahame's eyes, which took  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7732-00000039"/> 78        OPPORTUNITY. away all desire to pass a harsh judgment upon him, however well merited it might be; for though his wretched appearance may have been the result of sa- tiety, it was none the easier to bear on that account. "Perhaps," he thought, " with all his superfineness, life is no more a cheerful or brilliant affair with him than with most of us." " Yes, I shall certainly come; for either this town is growing confoundedly dull or I am," Grahame ex- claimed suddenly, with an entire change of manner and a sort of scornful half laugh (whether for himself or the town did not exactly appear), as he rose from his seat, and, going over to the fire, stood withPhis back towards it and his hands behind. He had read some- thing of his brother's idea in his face, and the reticent, sensitive nature instantly shut itself up. '"Well, you certainly don't look very brisk, old boy, that's a fact," answered Douglas; but the laugh and tone which were part of his reply made it by no means an unkind one. When the brothers parted, their plans seemed fixed for starting together the next day. The change which-came over Grahame's intentions before the next morning was only another proof of a maxim that I have long held: a Man proposes, but woman disposes." Coming in late that evening, he found two notes awaiting his arrival; one, a careless document direct- ed in a bold, irregular, man's hand; the other, a dainty   OPPORTUNITY.        79 little missive, whose sloping, sketchy address he in- stantly recognized. He had not seen it for two years, but he could well remember the time when he had lived under a gentle shower of such notes. "Place aux dames," he thought, and opened tile lady's first. After much preamble, which he knew by experience to be only the constitutional difficulty with such a woman to say simply and directly what she has to say, the writer, Mrs. Dr. Dan Harvey, came to her point, and asked him to pass the shooting season at her house. Tlhe letter was very cordial, and the invitation urgent; yet there was something about it that at once so irritated and amused Grahame that he could scarce- ly have told which feeling predominated. There was an indefinable tone of patronage which conveyed her meaning as plainly as though she had headed her letter- with this superscription: "I am married; whereas I was only Sophia Brent, I am now Mrs. Dan Harvey, and I wish to impress on you the difference in our rela- tive positions." Now, to have a woman to whom you have been ex- tending your condescension for years suddenly turn the tables on you in this manner is really more than masculine vanity can be expected to bear. Grahame found himself laughing involuntarily, but it was with a distinct and very unpleasant consciousness that some- how the edge of his laugh turned inward and cut him- self. He had no wish for Mrs. Harvey's regard, as he                     .      &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7732-00000040"/> 80        OPPORTUNITY. had had none for Sophia Brent's; but he was sensible of a keen desire to make her feel that she could not turn off her allegiance to him in quite thisJlight and easy manner, to remind her that she had once worn his chains.  The sharp prick she had given his vanity roused him as nothing had done for months. "I 'll go," he thought. "Douglas does n't care enough for my company to be disappointed, and I can ride over, at any time, to see him from Dr. Dan's, especially if I get bored or the shooting is better at the old home." As he thought this he turned the letter over, and found, on the last page, a post- script which he had not noticed. Mrs. Harvey had here played what she considered her strongest card. "Don't suppose," it said, " that I expect you to be satisfied with my power of entertainment, even when assisted by the pursuit of partridges and canvas-backs. Henrietta Dangerfield is here already, and I have in- vited more than a dozen of our old set, who have all promised to come; so be sure you do likewise. Besides (as I know you like novelty), the Doctor has a little niece staying with him, whom he thinks a young wonder, and I think a young savage. You can, by way of variety, try your hand at civilizing her." "Henrietta Dangerfield," he repeated slowly and thoughtfully. "I 'll write to-morrow that I 'll come by the end of the week. And now let me see what ,/   OPPORTUNITY.        81 the old gentleman has to, say," he added, breaking the seal of the other epistle. "Sophia tells me, my dear Grahame," Dr. Dan be- gan, with his usual abruptness, "that she has written you to come down immediately, and I send this to warn you against daring to refuse. The truth is, my dear boy, I am actually pining to see some of my old friends, and empty my lungs in a good talk. Sophia is filling the house with her particular acquaintances, whom you know I hate,--though, by the way, they are yours too; but though I expect the ladies will let me be anathema maranatha from that time forth, I in- tend to carry you off to my office, where it is possible to have some enjoyment suitable for rational beings." Over this letter Grahame smiled also; butefilere was more bitterness than mirth in his smile. "Tamed already! 'Good heavens, I wonder if I will ever come to that!" he exclaimed, as he dropped the paper, and went off to bed.  The next morning Douglas came hurriedly into his brother's bedroom, seeming to bring vigor and health and enjoyment with him from the crisp, fresh air he had just left. ' Why, Grahame," he cried, stopping abruptly mid- way, drawing up his near-sighted eyes at his brother, who had just waked up, " what does this mean? I expected to find you entirely ready. Ridge is at the door in the carriage, and we shall have to drive hard now to reach the depot in time." 4*             1  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7732-00000041"/> 82        OPPORTUNITY. "I 've changed my mind,' answered Grahame, ! yawning, and turning his side and his shoulder and hiss heavy head very much after the manner of Dr. Watts's sluggard, as his brother contemptuously thought. "And what may be the cause of this alteration?". asked the other, dryly, Grahame's vacillation of pur- pose and want of reliability in small matters nettling him, as it always did. "I received a note from Sophia Harvey last night, asking me to meet a large party at her house." "4Ah! Ah! Ad ladies among them. Of course I have nothing more to say," Douglas answered in short, pro- voked half sentences, making hisf way hastily to the door as he spoke. But when lie reached it he stopped, and turned completely round. "Take my word for it, Grahame Ferguson," he said, with the strong brow rather unpleasantly knilt, lifting his hand as he spoke, " women will be your de- struction yet, unless, as extremes meet, some one of them be youbtsalvation." Grahame sat deliberately up in bed, and looked at him for a full moment. The eyes over which the lids usually drooped with uich lazy indifference were wide open now, and full of a hungry, craving, wistful light, so strange and unexpected that it fairly startled his brother. The next second it was gone. "It is highly probable," he answered sententiously, and dropped'lazily back among the pillows. Douglas's anger was forgotten in his astonishment,    OPPORTUNITY.        83  or perhaps it had evaporated in his sudden outhurst; at all events, he called out, as he hastily left, - "Good by; come over to see us if you can."

In the old dining-room breakfast was going on. This was the work of time, as the guests descended at very irregular periods, but, being one of the pleasantest por- tions of the day, no one wished to shorten it. Those who came early. would wait to chat with and entertain those who came late, and the latter were decidedly in the majority. At this time perhaps a dozen persons sat around the table, with several gaps of empty chairs between them. Of these figures only Sophia at its head and Dr. Dan at its foot are as yet familiar tp the reader. But of the rest two are destined to walk through this story to its end. They sat on different sides of the table, so singularly unlike, so diametrically opposed to each other in every- thing, that their sex seemed all they had in common. A full-grown woman and a half-grown girl, I give age the pas. As I think of[ Henrietta Dangerfield, I search in vain through my memory for another woman so regu- larly beautiful as she. The pale, straight, golden hair; the classic profile; the cheek like the inner side of the conch; the large, sky-blue eyes, with their white lids and   OPPORTUNITY.   '85 long lashes of a darker gold than the hair; the tall,. beautifullyv moulded form,--all come back to me, and form an unrivalled whole. I have called her a beau- tiful woman; but except for the exquisite coloring she would have impressed you rather as a beautiful statue. Even in that comfortable, homelike scene and common- place occupation this effect was still very strong. Mo- tion and emotion she seemed equally to avoid; but, if action became necessary, it was performed with a calm, cold grace as artistically perfect as her previous repose. Her walk, with the blue eyes gazing far away before her, always reminded me of that of a somnambulist; the very droop of her hair, the sweep of her dress, all seemed controlled by some latent principle of har- mony.  Even now, sitting at that breakfast-table in her plain, dark morning dress, the stately grace of her attitude, the pose of her head, would do no discredit to a queen upon her throne. Now as always she seemed to be breathing a peculiar atmosphere of her own, 'whose stillness and coldness extended for a little space around her, to whose edge you could easily come; but whose icy, impalpable barrier you could never cross. Around this magic circle, men whom her wondrous , beauty drew irresistibly towards her walked in an in- fatuated despair, she seemingly as unconscious of their pain as of their pleasure. And yet nearly each one of those around her knew of a time when all this had not been, could remember a Henrietta Dangerfield very, very unlike the one now  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7732-00000043"/> '86         OPPORTUNITY. before them. They could have told you that only three years before she had entered society, a girl proud and reticent by nature, but sensitive and uncontrolled to an unusual degree, dealing out her favors or her frowns with a royal want of calculation. Then it was that she and Grahame Ferguson had met. He had dangled in the train of the new beauty for perhaps six months, partly from instinctive, constitutional admira- tion of her loveliness, and partly because his social cur-  rent had set in her direction for that space of time, and he had naturally drifted with it. At last, wearying of r this as of all things, he had followed the shifting fash- ion to some other shrine, and only accorded to the old place of worship the incense of a pleasant memory. This was all he had done, but it was enougj to change Henrietta Dangerfield to Iwhat she now was. He had no false vows, no settled eff6rt at deception with which to reproach himself; he would have-7listened as to the ; insanest folly had you suggested that his conscience might be uneasy at its burden; but let him look to 't that at the judgment-day he have not to answer for that woman's soul. That which had soured Sophia, Brent had petrified this different nature. She grew cold and cruel; that measure which had been mete to her did ghe mete again. Her whole emotional nature had beenturned back upon herself, and the flood seemed to have drowned out all bloom and flow'r of tender womanliness. Her intellect, instead of com- ing to her rescue, had likewise only preyed upon itself.   OPPORTUNITY.        87 Possessing just sufficient genius to know its needs without its succors; to have tasted its agonies with no compensating draught of its divine joys; to have de- scended to its purgatory, if no deeper, without ever having been caught up into its third heaven, - she and her sisters have always seemed to me the most miserable of all women. To take up the book of some woman to whom God has vouchsafed. thie relief, the gift of speech, which he has denied you, and feel that you too know all this and far, far morle ; that but for the dumb devil with which you seem intellectually pos- sessed you also could speak out your soul, if it were but as a swan's song, - this is bitter. And yet I could count scores of women who seem to me to be always writhing with this spirit, to live ]hungering and thirst- ing for'some triumphant event or moment outside of themselves which will burst their bonds asunder, and let them attain this possibility. This Henrietta Dangerfield suffered silently, self- scornfully, disdaining to struggle, only drawing the fine magic veil of pride more closely around her, and growing colder and stiller. Her heart, though, had been much more strongly-agitated and developed than. her head; and, like a veritable woman, it was around it that her life and her care for life centred. The only satisfaction, the only compensation, now attainable was to Blake others feel what she had felt. If her existence, reft -of its natural aim, had a settled purposes it was this. But very little evidence of such cold cruelty is  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7732-00000044"/> 88         OPPORTUNITY. seen in the calm smile that curves the lovely lips and shines from her eyes upon the man who is next her, gradually losing his free will tunder her spell. And now let us turn to the girl. As I have said, a greater contrast could not be imagined. Ugly I think any one would at this period have called her, at first sight. Figure large and overgrown, ungrace- ful from immaturity, though not from positive defect. Face fo match the figure, with strong, blunt, irregular features, not the suggestion of an acute angle in it. But in the mouldings of the lower half there lay, par- ' tially revealed, unfathomable capacities for feeling,. passion, and action; while upon the brow's low breadth there sat an intellect yet undeveloped, an ideality and imagination with their pinions yet unfledged. And yet this brow was the least strikingly powerful division of the" countenance, it was so essentially that of a woman, perhaps even of a poet.   The noticeable peculiarity of this face was that it possessed but two colors, if colors they can be called,--white and black. Strong, jetty hair, whose thickness and richness were concealed by its want of length, which compelled it to be twisted up in, a tight, unbecoming way; with a com- plexion, which health and exercise only changed from sallow pallor to clear. This singular coloring, or rather contrast, showed itself most strongly in the eyes; though there it passed to a higher form, and became lightand darkness. With- sorrow, sickness, pain, and doubt, they would- gloom down until they were like   OPPORTUNITY.        89 night; whilst a happier emotion would cause them to beam out like stars, orbs of purest brightness. I have never known two persons to agree as to the shade of her eyes, either in her present chrysalis state or in her developed womanhood. My own opinion is, that their seemingly achromatic brilliancy possessed all tints, and developed them as person or event demanded, or became worthy of the revelation; that at times they were prismatic, and their clear shine produced the whole spectrum. Even at this early stage she had learned somewhat of their power, was proud of them, in her secret heart, for the reason that she alone knew they were not materially handsome, that their beauty was the triumph of mind over matter, was not so much their intrinsic attribute, as it was that of the soul which looked out of them.  There was a rather peculiar expression in them as she sat on the opposite side of the table from Henrietta Dangerfield, in an attitude which, but for its complete unconsciousness and na- tive, careless prides would have been awkward in the extreme, gazing over at her with a naive, absorbed admiration of her beauty, which was half child, half artist. Such was Harvey Berney at sixteen, her woman's nature still sleeping the calm sleep of childhood, un- consciously awaiting the moment, person, or event which was to awaken it, never again to slumber. She little knew that, in the ensuing five minutes, she should hear the first faint notes of the overture of her  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7732-00000045"/> 90        OPPORTUNITY. life,--an existence to her truly an opera, opus,-- work. '6 Dr. Dan," called out Mrs. Harvey from her end of the table, with an expression of extreme compla- cency both iin face, and voice. "Well, my dear?" was the matrimonial response, uttered with -the true conjugal indifference as to her further remarks.. "Grahame Ferguson says he will come, that he will probably be here by the end of the week," she an- nounced. As the words sounded, Harvey Berney, who had heard them almost without hearing them, saw the figure at which she was looking make a vague,. indefi- nite movement, saw the rose-colored lips part -quickly and close slowly. Even then that girl's eyes possessed a degree of their amazing future perceptiveness, even then she had formed the unconscious habit of marking and storing in her memory the slightest effect which she could not instantly trace to its cause. The change in Miss Dangerfield, faint as it was, roused her into noticing the remark which had probably induced it. Turning towards her uncle (for in that relation Dr. Dan stood to her, as the daughter of his well-beloved sister Margaret), she found that he was radiant with pleasure. "I am really delighted, -delighted," he repeated, in his magnificently vehement way, " then, little woman, we'll begin to enjoy ourselves, - won't we?" he added, n.'

What had she to do with this stranger, of whom she had never even heard, for whom Dr. Dan thus unceremoniously claimed her intimacy and liking?  The shy, proud nature was scarcely prepared to acquiesce in being so swiftly and easily disposed of even by the hands it loved best. 's Yes," she answered hesitatingly, as he seemed to await a reply, but the mental reservation was so clear through her assent that it sounded more like a protest. As Miss Dangerfield heard Dr. Dan's last remark, the glance of her large blue eyes passed slowly away from her neighbor's face and rested on Harvey's. When the girl had spoken, it returned with an equally calm deliberation, and she resumed her occupation of smil- ing away his senses. Dr. Harvey went on expressing his pleasure until the breakfast party broke up, which was almost imme- diately. An hcar or two after, Dr. Dan sat in his office, as it was called. It was a large room in the rear of the dining-room, both being separated by the hall from the parlor. This was his sanctum, and as peculiar as himself. Here were stored his medical books, and his professional effects in general. Here he received all who came to see him on business, either as a physician or as a farmer. Here such accounts as he kept were  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7732-00000046"/> 92        OPPORTUNITY. settled, and affairs of the estate administered. Here he treasured whatever lihe did not wish to be meddled. with; among other things, his individuality. When he retired within its sacred shades, not Sophia herself dared to enter without some prellmnary knocking, or at least show of it. But she had soon found that it never, to say the least, improved his temper to see her there; that her requests were much more favora- bly answered in any other part of the house, and, being a practical woman, she avoided it both from policy and choice. There was but one exception to the rigor of this exclusive policy, and Harvey was the favored one. She went and came with the freedom of a pet kitten or a familiar spirit, and indeed she was both to Dr. Dan. Nothing pleased him so much as to have her about him. Though it was very seldom necessary, he would condescend to coaxing, even to a little covert intriguing, to induce her to desert the parlor and the rest of the party for him. He had lored and fondled her from her infancy, but just so soon as her mind began to develop she had risen to, companionship. He was as devoted to her as if she had been his own' child; but she was far more really like him, more con- genial with him, than any daughter could have been, inheriting, as she must have done, Sopllia's nature, at least in part. As for the girl, she being a con- stitutional hero-worshipper, had long since set up her uncle's image in her mental Pantheon, and fallen down before it.   OPPORTUNITY.        9 This morning, hearing the door open,-Dr. Dan did not even think of looking, up, knowing who it must be. Harvey walked listlessly about, picking up the books, stirring the fire, and so forth, in a way which in any one else would have so broken the thread of lhis thoughts that he would have angrily ordered them out of the room, but of which in her - such is the effect of habit-he was scarcely conscious. At last she came and sat down by him at the table. "Uncle Dan," she said presently, in a tone through whichi still sounded the tacit protest she had made at breakfast, " who is Grahame Ferguson?" "Why, ,don't you know?" lie answered with some surprise, thoiugtl his pen went scratching on; t he lives in Baltimore2 ,1 "Now, uncIet" exclaimed Harvey, with a provoked laugh, " you .know very well that we might not only live in the same city, but in the same street, and still be as perfect strangers as if we were wild Arabs; for I never do anything but go to school, and mamma never visits any one but old ladies." "Well, how shall I introduce him to you?" laughed Dr. Dan, in reply, --' personally or ancestrally?" "In both ways." "He belongs to this county. You must remember seeing old Mr. Ferguson at church when you were a child; he is his son." ("Then I know all about his forefathers, so you can pass on to himself." 1              k  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7732-00000047"/> "       b-PRTUNITY. "My dear," said Dr. Dan, laying down his ptn-- and leaning back in his chair with a queer expression twinkling in his eyes, " perhaps I should best describe him by saying that he affects the whole feminine gen- der as a lump of sugar acts upon flies and insects in general."       7 "Ahi" was the only reply; but the long-drawn ejaculation was a sneer that would have made Gra- hame Ferguson's ears tingle could he have heard it, and tlthe eyes would scarcely have flashed into haugh- tier brilliancy had she been personally insulted. The individual meaning and reference of her man- ner were entirely lost on Dr. Dan, who always thought of and talked to Harvey far more as though she belonged to his sex than to her own. Meanwhile he regarded her as only a precocious child, utterly blinded by habit and familiarity to the fact that she had emerged into womanhood. Perhaps, had he looked at her at this moment with clearer sight, her life's history might have been very different; perhaps much of its mourning might have been joy. "Somewhat after your own style in your younlg days, - is it not, uncle?" she exclaimed, after a mo- ment, her voice and manner changing to that half- rallying admiration with which she so often addressed him. "Perhaps so, - perhaps so," he answered, in his grand way, but with a very well satisfied smile upon his lips ; for no man, be his hair ever so gray, objects O      X   OPPORTUNITY.        95 to being reminded that there has been a time when he too played the part of conquering hero. "But it seems this youngster's success quite throws in the c shade my small exploits in that line," he went on with a condescending humility the girl was quite keen enough to take at its proper value. "' Saul hath killed ]his thousands, but David his tens of thousands!"' she chanted in mock heroics. "I don't believe it," she added, in utter disdain. "You will soon have a chance to judge, for your- self," he rejoined, by no means displeased at her un- wavering loyalty to himself. 46 And now, my dear, I must really finish my letter; for it is on business, and must go by the next mail." This putting a stop to- the conversation, Harvey went back to the fire and stood looking into it with half-knit brows, thinking of " this Grahame Fer- guson," as she mentally called him, with a sense of personal resentment and animosity singularly bestowed upon a person whom she had never seen, whose very name was unknown to her a few hours before. "Sophia's friend, too! That of itself would be enough," she thought, with an expression of contempt coming into her face. "Well, I fancy he will find at least one woman in this household who will decline( playing the part of fly, however alluring his sweetness may be." And having settled her own line of con- duct for the future, she dismissed the subject from her mind.  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7732-00000048"/> 96        OPPORTUNITY. CHAPTER    VIII. DURING the many years of her widowhood, Mrs. Berney had been accustomed to spend part of every summer at Bonbrook. Even when its owner was off on one of his erratic tours, he was delighted to have his sister and her child occupy his home. Their custom had been to- come down in June, when Harvey's school closed, and return to the city in Sep- tember, when it reopened. This season their plan had been changed, as Dr. Dan had persuaded his sis- ter to let her daughter remain with- him to be guided through a course of English literature. Thus it was they were still with him in November. This plan had been settled upon during the previous spring, when Dr. Dan had come up to Baltimore for a few days to refresh himself with a sight of his niece. Putting her, as he always did,- through a regular cate- chism of what she had been doing and reading and thinking, she replied by quoting "I Sartor .Resartus," with that unbounded enthusiasm with which that book possessed many young persons of her stamp. Dr. Dan listened in absolute horror. In the first place, he was extremely tenacious about the religious orthodoxy of his womankind, sincerely considering scepticism a strictly masculine privilege; and secondly, having I   OPPORTUNITY.        97   [ drunk profoundly at- the wells of pure English unde- filed, he regarded the Carlyle dialect as unintelligible jargon.

"-I have never attempted to control Harvey intellectually, and I certainly canno thegin now. Be- sides, I believe she understands the, need of her own heart and brain better than you or I, and I do not think we have any right to interfere," she added, standing loyally by her daughter, perhaps even against her judgment, as is the wont of good mothers. "Very well,. very well;" said Dr. Dan, sorely dis- ! co'i:ted at this defection of his confidently expected ally. "(I suppose the child must have her own way. But bring her down to Bonbrook this summer, and / will put her through a good course of Shakespeare, and see what that will do for her."

The day after that conversation at the breakfast- tabl6, Harvey came into the parlor about nopn, and fonnd it as she best liked it, entirelydeserted. The men were out shooting, and the ladies were in their rooms, the absence of both secured until dinner-timrne. The room was a long one, with a double window at its farther end. Drawing the curtains to tone the light pleasantly, she curled herself up in a corner of the sofa beneath, and opened the book she had brought with a blissful sense of perfect satisfaction, both mental and physical. It was "Goethe's Correspondence with a Child." For an hour or two she lay reading and dreaming, so interweaving her own imaginings with the text, so living and feeling every emotion of the others, that she was unconscious where her thoughts began and Bettina's ended. She was wrapped in the glorified mists of her secret world of fancy, lost to all perception of her external life. Sulddenly she was unpleasantly startled by the ab- rupt opening of a door at the upper end of the room. As is the case with nervous persons, the jar shook her out of her revery, and completely broke the thread of her thoughts. She looked up just in time to see a gentleman enter, to hear the servant close the door behind him with as much noise as he had made in opening it. In a single moment she had arrived at   bPPORTUNITY.        99 a perfect certainty as to who it was, had experienced such a sensation of her own ugliness, awkwardness, and immaturity, as in all her life together she had never known, had received the contrast of his elegance and beauty as a personal insult. Then she 'fastened her eyes on her book, and read on with mechanical persistence. She knew she was showing herself at her worst by retaining her queer, ungraceful situation, and she rather enjoyed the idea. She was aware that she could have risen, and welcomed him to her uncle's house with that grand air which- she could easily com- mand, and which at times made her relationship to Dr. Dan very evident; but nothing could have induced her to do it. Poor child! she might well have spared herself all this heat and excitement, had she known the serene unconsciousness of its object. Coming from the broad daylight into the shaded room, Grahame had not seen her, - had supposed the room empty. Tired of his constrained posture in the cars and carriage, he began lazily pacing'up and down, while waiting for some one to receive him. Presently, coming to that end of the room, with eyes grown accustomed to the subdued light, he perceived the figure on the sofa, which by its position appeared below its real size, "An ugly, crosslooking girl," was his compliment- ary mental comment. As the figure paid him no visible attention, he gave it none, and continued his walk.  ( ,                /  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7732-00000050"/> 100        OPPORTUNITY. But Grahame was used to being regarded in some degree by everything feminine, and because she did not look at him he began to wish she would. He was passing her for perhaps the sixth or seventh time, when, without lifting her eyes from her book, she made a quick, impatient movement with her hand. The man stopped as abruptly as, though she had cried t"Halt!" If she had said, '"The sound of your footsteps is an impertinent interruption to my reading," she could not have expressed her meaning more perfectly. For an instant he stood still in wonder; for another, in anger. "So I suppose this is the young savage,9 he thought. "I hope so, at least; for if there are two of -them in the same house, I surely shall go over to Douglas's to- morrow morning." As she became apparently unconscious of his pres- ence so soon as it ceased to disturb her, he resumed- his walk, but with a careful avoidance of noise. Each time as he neared her, he could not help feeling curi- ous as to what she might do next, but with a strong determination that, let it be what it might, he would give no recognition of it. In this state of expectancy he forgot that his footsteps were again gradually be- coming audible. Consequently, when he least looked for it, there came once more that hauighty gesture of command, and once more he obeyed it instinctively and instantaneously. "t This is -growing ridiculouS," .he thought, as he felt   OPPORTUNITY.        101 his face flush with annoyance ; and going to the centre of the room he seated himself in an arm-chair, in a very stately mood and fmanner. Thus they sat for some five minutes, he looking as persistently at the door as Harvey did at her book. Then there was a rustle, a whiff of perfume, and Mrs. Harvey glided up to him with smiles and out- stretched hand. ' Ah!" he murmured softly and  slowly, as he rose, took her hand, and bent over it, That was all he said, but his tone indicated that this was a very pretty woman, for whom he had a sentimen- tal tenderness to which he could have given far fuller expression had he permitted himself to do so. It really meant nothing; it was only a formula Grahame had adopted in saluting his lady friends, as accomplish- ing a maximum of result with a minimum of effort. Sophia had known him too long not to accept it at its appropriate value. Still she found it very pleasant. But Harvey took it for what it seemed, and while she could not help appreciating the delicate perfection of its expression, she was filled with amazement and contempt at the offering of such worship at such a shrine. She quietly left the room; so quietly that Sophia did not know she had been in it. But Gra- hame had seen her departure, and, was'extremely re- lieved by it. He knew he would h ve found it hard to carry on the conversation in the tone he had in- augurated, had that still figure retained its place.  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7732-00000051"/> 102        OPPORTUNITY. "Your David has arrived," Harvey announced scornfully, as she entered her uncle's office, and sent Dr, Dan off as full of pleasure as she was of dis- pleasure.            '% When Harvey came in to dinner that day, the rest had all taken their places. She slipped into her's, next her uncle, apparently unnoticed and uinoticing. But neither was the case. In entering she had given one comprehensive glance around, and had taken in the situation. Things were just as usual, except that on Miss Dangerfield's left hand sat Grahame Ferguson, so that in turning to speak to him her face was towards Harvey. At what age does the womanly Instinct awaken? In that instant, with no corresponding experience to give its unerring guidance, .the girl had read the wo- man's secret, had entered into the proud lady's inner- most soul. Grahame, entirely recovered from his slight defeat in the morning, was in unusual spirits and in unwonted devotion to Henrietta. But somehow, through all his engrossment of word and look towards Miss Danger- field, he found time for much occasional thought about that "ugly, cross-looking girl " at the other end of the table. "Ah, there she is!" he had mentally exclaimed, as he saw her enter. It was not his first look in search of her, nor the last he sent in her direction. The deliberate, practical way   OPPORTUNITY.       .103 in which she ate her dinner amused him. But once when her uncle made some merry remark to her, Grahame caught the upward gleam'of the dancing eyes and the momentary quiver of the lips which was her answer. "I was mistaken when I called her ugly,9 he slowly said to himself, with a perplexity which found its way into his face until it faded before the charm of thesvonderful blue! eyes so near him. Their spell was sttong nough to absorb him for hours after. He had not been thrown intimately with Henrietta for a long time, and her beauty and mental power came upon him with renewed freshness. It was night be- fore he again remembered Harvey's existence. Sophia's guests had all been in a brilliant mood, and Grahame had been both extremely entertained and extremely entertaining. Towards -the close of the evening Dr. Dan came in, and drawing up his favorite chair and candle-stand, took a periodical from his pocket, and proceeded to cut the leaves. Presently, Sophia's nephew, Ben Brent, big and ugly out of all proportion to his fifteen years, sat down at the same table with a draught-board before him, and Haryey took her place opposite, just at Dr. Dan's shoulder. Playing this slight game from a good-natured desire to entertain the boy, who was her devoted friend and ally, the girl had plenty of time and attention to be- stow on her next neighbor. Dr. Dan divided his at- tention between the book before him, the company on I  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7732-00000052"/> 104        OPPORTUNITY. his lef, and the girl on his right. But Grahame no- ticed that Harvey got-far the largest share, and that the responses the Doctor received over his shoulder seemed to excite his amusement and approbation far more keenly than those given him by the rest of the, party. f Those sotto voce answers roused Grahame's cu- riosity. I His interest in his own conversation flagged as he wondered what they were talking of; and he finally concluded that,. for a short time at least, lie would be willing to change places with Ben Brent. As the moments passed, this mood increased; so that when the company rose to retire, he w'as much more ready to sanction the movement than he would have been an hour before. They gradually dispersed; Gra- hamne and Henrietta and Harvey and her uncle coming out into the hall after nearly all the others had passed on up stairs. Dr. Dan opened his office door, and, standing in it, -called the other gentleman to him, and began talking to him in his large-toned way. Grahame listened and assented in laughing silence, which gave the elder gentleman all he required, while it did not distract the real attention of the younger from his fe- maQe companions; neither did it prevent his hearing all they said, though they so imagined. Both had gone to the other side of'the hall for their-'bedroom candles. So radiantly lovely did Henrietta look with the near light in her hand illumining her face, and with that new expression in the depth of her eyes which they had held since midday, that Harvey stood   OPPORTUNITY.      -105 still, and gazed at her in speechless wonder. The two had been under the same roof for ten days; in that time the elder had once addressed the younger, and then in strict accordance with the "youthful-barba- rian " theory which Sophia had promulgated among the company. But the unconscious flattery of that young, expressive face might well have stirred the vaniity of a harder woman than she, "Why do you look at me so, child?" she asked, not ill-naturedly, but with a patronizing condescension which provoked Harvey much more. "Because you are so very well worth looking at," was the simple response, given with perfect coolness. The rose-leaf hue of the cheek deepened perceptibly, and the lady laughed as she said, - "So I have the honor to count you among my admirers." "You are the, most beautiful human being I have ever seen---or imagined," she added, as though her experience in this latter department were much the larger. Thegirl spoke as though it were a relief to her to express her aesthetic enthusiasm. "And yet Sophia says you called me a statue last week," Henrietta went on, a little private pique com- ing to the surface. In an instant the look was in Harvey's face which a roused sense of injustice always brought there. How she contrived to indicate so dark a frown, with the brow only growing smoother and the- eyes broader 5^   '  * a   &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7732-00000053"/> OPPORTUNITY. and brighter, I could never understand, but she did it. "It is like Sophia," she said slowly, after a rao- ment's pause, " to give the letter of my words without the spirit. Miss Dangerfield, you have never re- minded me so strongly of a statue as you have to-day, -only it was Pygmalion's." Looking smilingly at Dr. Dan, Grahame suddenly winced as though a rifle-ball had whistled past his ear, and struck some one near him. Good night," said Harvey, quietly, and went her way. The candle flaring up from Miss Dangerfield's hand showed a face no longer rose-colored, showed the beautiful eyes, usually so cold and hard, following the girl with something like fear dawning in them. Then she, too, passed on. f                         X.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   OPPORTUNITY.   107   CHAPTER       IX. a 0* THE next morning Harvey came down too late for the regular breakfast. The gentlemen had gone off after partridges, and the ladies had accompanied them some distance across the fields for exercise. Miss Dangerfield and Gra- hame had both lingered around the breakfast-room until the last moment. Twenty-four hours before, the mere child had been an utter stranger to one, and scarcely more to the other, and yet this thorough man and woman of the world were now awaiting her move- ments with curious anxiety. But they could have learned little if she had eaten her tea and toast as calmly in their presence as she did in their absence. She had scarcely finished it when Ben came in, and announced that she was to come out into the woods with him. "If you stay in the house any longer you '11 be haing one' of your headaches, and then you 're no good," said the boy, with more real kindness than apparent courtesy. He had given up the morning's shooting for her sake, -an act of extreme boyish self-denial, which was fully appreciated. If these two had had nothing else in common, their equal detestation of Sophia would &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7732-00000054"/> 108        OPPORTUNITY. have bound them together. Nothing but the splendid shooting and his father's wishes ever tempted Ben within her doors. With Dr. Dan he got on very well, though that gentleman objected to boys on prin- ciple, and to this particular one as absorbing more of Harvey's attentioa than he cared to spare. Before Miss Dangerfield's return they were off. Thus it was that she found herself obliged to wait until the necessary reunion at dinner to meet the girl in the tacit mental combat in which she hoped to con- quer her. They crossed each other at the parlor- door. Both involuntarily stopped, and stood face to face, eye to eye. It was blue eyes against black, and neither quailed. The woman's steadiness was a mir- acle of mental discipline and social drill; the girl's was only the result of native power and lack of anything at stake. The rest. of the company, pressing on to- wards the dining-room, swept them apart almost im- mediately; but Henrietta had made the impression she had intended. "With-your cold, clear glitter, I thought you made of ice," the girl was mentally ejaculating as she slowly followed the others, " because that is at least capable of melting; but you seem changed over night into diamond." Again Henrietta sat beside Grahame, as on the pre- vious day, and again she fronted the searching gaze of the girl; but even Harvey's perception found noth- ing to rest upon. Henrietta sustained her accustomed /l 1'.   OPPORTUNITY.        109 r6le to its minutest shade of manner. Grahame had long before acquired a faculty, very useful in social life, of dividing his attention, so that he seemed to possess two pairs of ears. But to-day he essayed its exercise in vain, for he heard nothing from the othA end of the table, until, as they rose, Dr. Dan said n slightly elevated tone, - "Come, little woman, unless we go now we will have very little time to read," and the two walked out of the room together. Grahame looked round at Mrs. Harvey, as thought asking the meaning of her husband's remark. Sophia proceeded to explain, without any conscious intention of misrepresenting; yet she conveyed the impression that the girl had an extreme love of immoral reading which her uncle was trying to divert. Mrs. Harvey was a skilful hostess, having always some little plan on hand to prevent general stagnation. Sometimes it was a ride, sometimes a walk; this even- ing it was a dance after tea. Grahame was smoking in the hall, where tobacco was unlimitedly allowed, and asked leave to finish his cigar before joining in the quadrille. The first sets were consequently formed without him, very much to his satisfaction; for, though a famous waltzer when he chose, he generally avoided dancing of every kind as so much unnecessary exertion. "Harvey will play for you," said Sophia, and the girl readily acquiesced. She knew that the gentlemen all looked upon her  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7732-00000055"/> "O        OPPORTUNITY. too entirely in the light of an ugly school-girl, to think of asking her to dance when older, prettier partners were procurable., Ben would have liked well enough to do so; but then Ben always stood on the ladies' dresses, and so she did not care to assume the respon- sibility of him through a quadrille. Grahame, from his position in the hall, could watch through the open door the movements of persons and events in the parlor. The dancers were in the- centre of the room, whilst the piano was at the end. The man's eyes lost, for a moment, their indifferent gloom, as he perceived Harvey seated at it alone, and so apart from the others. He foresaw an opportunity he had been desiring all day. As soon as the dance had well begun, he threw away his half-finished cigar, and en- tered the room. Coming up to the piano, he stood quietly by it, apparently watching the moving figures with lazy interest.. . "Whose quadrilles are you playing?" he said at last, carelessly turning towards Harvey. "Anything to begin with," he thought. He spoke exactly as he might have done had she been a good little girl of ten industriously practising her music-lesson, ignoring the want of an introduction on the score of their difference in age. The girl internally blazed at both the manner and the action. In return, she simply gave the name of the composer, but gave it in such an entirely conclu- sive way, that Grahame really found further remark   OPPORTUNITY.   1l on the subject out of his power. Therefore he fell back upon a composed attitude which he could always assume, though on this occasion its ease extended very little below the surface. Harvey played on with as little apparent regard to him as though he had been an inanimate object. "He is graciously according me an opportunity to admire him," she was thinking, with that boundless anger and resentment which only arises from such a cause in extreme youth, and which with her was only more intense from her vivid perception of his grace and elegance, and of how impossible she would have found its attainment. ("If he expects frankincense at my hands, he, will find only myrrh." Grahame stood for perhaps five minutes. By that time he had become aware that he might remain there for five hours for any notice he would gain from the girl beside him. He began to find himself rather un- equal to the situation. One more effort he determined to make. "Will you dance the next set with me?" he asked, turning this time abruptly. "No!" Grahame bowed profoundly, and retreated with all the dignity he still possessed. That night he went to bed more thoroughly out of conceit with himself, and indeed with everybody else, than he had beenfSor ten years. As he lay, watchful  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7732-00000056"/> "2        OPPORTUNITY. and restless, he imagined that he firmly resolved to leave for his old home immediately. But coming down the next morning after six hours' sleep, to the bright fresh air and cheerful breakfast-table, his confidence in himself insensibly returned, and things struck him in a different light. Hie was not going to give up this chance for entertainment so readily; a plan occurred to him by which he might perhaps that very day gain her attention. As Dr. Dan left the room after dinner, Grahame joined him., "' May I smoke my cigar in your office this after- noon?" he asked pleasantly. "My dear boy, I shall be charmed. I have not disputed the ladies' monopoly of you because I knew you would be obliged to fall back upon me6 after a day or two; and you see I was right," the other answered with a laugh, and led the way to his room. There for an hour he harangued on every possible subject, relieving his soul of all that had been pent up in it since he had last had a congenial male auditor. For an equal time the younger man, listened with some real and more apparent interest, which did not, how- ever, prevent his listening also for the opening of the, door he was momentarily expecting. "I must have been mistaken in supposing they read every afternoon," he thought. "She must come at last though, for she spends much of her time here."

It was pure accident which had defeated his calcu- lation. - That morning, Harvey, whose taste and dexterity in such matters reached high art, had made an attack upon Mrs. Berney's favorite dress-cap, declaring that it made her-pretty mamma look lik a fright, and that she would n't bear it any longer. Having pulled it to pieces for her own'amusement in the forenoon, she felt called upon to put it together again in the, after- noon, for her mother's wearing in the &amp;vening., She had accordingly told Dr. Dan, at the dinner-tabie, that she could not come to the office, that 'he had some- thing to do for her mother that could not be put off. He, of course, made a show of remonstrance; but as lie was really scrupulous about standing between his sis- ter and her daughter, he finally gave up the point. The girl brought her pretty, half-finished work into the parlor, and sat down to complete it. The sight, and especially the success the swift fingers achieved, put Sophia into a bad humor instantly. That Harvey should know so much more of books and care so much more for literature than herself, only gained her non- comprehension and dislike, but that she should be at the same time her superior in taste and skill in dress ex- torted her reluctant homage. It was a species of tal- ent she could fully appreciate, and it filled her with sincere envy. It  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7732-00000057"/> "4        OPPORTUNITY. The edge of her present irritation was that the girl had calmly refused, only the day before, to performr some similar service for her, from a knowledge that the very first favor of the kind sher was weak enough to concede would simply be, her- installation into the office of private milliner to Sophia. Mrs. Harveyis talent at invisible aggravation laid always been uncom- mon, but this afternoon she surpassed herself in its ex- ercise. Every one of the girl's peculiarities and pet ideas she touched upon as dexterously as though they had been the keys of an instrument, sandwiching her remarks between little lady-like laughs, which said as much as the words, and tried Harvey's nerves far more. She opened not her lips in return; but her innate, though unconscious, dramatic power moulded her every fibre to the expression of what raged within. "Apparently Miss Berney sitteth in the seat of the scornful this afternoon," said Henrietta's cold voice at last. If Miss Dangerfield's remark were true before she had spoken, it was certainly much more so afterwards. Mrs. Berney, who could have lived peaceably in the house with Nero or Henry VIII. (and whom Sophia, to do her justice, always treated with respect and cour- tesy) had sat by, wondering what her daughter found so very irritating in the conversation, and sorrowfully attributing her anger to her defective temper and training. The girl finished her work to its last: stitch, and laid   OPPORTUNITY,        115 it upon her mother's lap. Then she rose, and deliber- ately walked out of the room. In the office the state of things had slightly changed. Dr. Dan, who had about- said his say, and who had been riding hard tover the country among his patients all the morning, began; as the twilight deepened, to doze in his arm-chair. (t Will she never come?"'thought Grahame. "How- ever, it is far,pleasanter to sit here in the quiet than to be in the parlor listening to Sophia's chatter, so I shall stay where I am." He got up and walked about the room, looking idly at the rows of books in their cases ; then, as unoccupied people invariably do, he went to the window and stared  vaguely out, though he could see nothing. The walls of the old house being very thick, the windows formed a recess of about two feet. In this had been fitted a stationary lounge, and over all the thick, faded cur- tains, now partially looped aside, could be dropped. As it looked very comfortable, he piled up the pillows, and ensconced himself among them in as reclining a position as his length would permit. Presently Dr. Dan roused himself, gaped prodig- iously, and stirred the fire, Grahame rather feared he would begin talking to him again, and was relieved to find he did not. The truth was; the elder gentleman supposed his friend had left the room while he had been asleep, and had not the least idea that he was then lying within a dozen feet of him.  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7732-00000058"/> "6        OPPORTUNITY. A very few minutes after, the door opened and shut nervously, and Grahame saw the figure for whose ap- pearance he had so long waited come hurriedly down the room. It stopped behind Dr. Dan's chair, and leaned upon the high back. Both men read the mean- ing of her manner and movement; though the elder alone instinctively divined its cause, and grew sick with indignation at his powerlessness to prevent its con- stant recurrence. It took him some little time before he could gain sufficient self-control to attempt to con- trol her. Then, putting his hand behind him, he drew her round to his side. "Somebody been rubbing my pussy the wrong way, eh? Well, come and be stroked smooth again." The girl flung herself down on her knees beside him. Passing his arm around her, he laid her head on his shoulder, and softly put away the hair from her forehead. "O uncle!" the excited, quivering young voice ex- claimed, as she clung to him with passionate gratitude, "what should I do without you?" "My pet, what should I do without you?" was the tender reply. "Ah, but it is so different; she cannot hurt you." Grahame saw and Harvey felt the form against whiqh she was leaning stir suddenly, as if touched too tlosely home. He comprehended instantly that, thoughl Dr. Dan had always possessed too much pride and AT'    OPPORTUNITY.       117 dignity to speak against the woman who held the posi- tion of his wife, she was probably asc severe a trial to him as to the girl. Harvey was filled with contrition and humiliation of spirit for the thoughtless wound she had given him. Too unconquerably haughty and reticent to be ablo even then to say broadly "For- give me," she put up her hand to his cheek, with an humble, penitent little caress, which thrilled through Grahame as the most exquisite pleading for pardon he had ever witnessed. Dr. Dan caught the hand, and, kissing it, held it in his own, in mute reply to her mute appeal. In spite of Grahame's vivid interest in what was going on before him, he had a very unpleasant suspi- cion that he had no right to be there, that his position was scarcely an honorable one. He began to compre- hend that his recent companion was as ignorant of his presence as was the last-comer. And yet he did not see how he could move. To leave the room he would have to pass directly by them, and he fully realized that he could not more cruelly hurt the girl than by letting her know he had witnessed her late exhibition of intense feeling. As they seemed to have sunk into a long, dreamy silence, he, too, lay still and watched them with a freshness of sympathetic vitality that called him back to his boyhood. Presently Harvey began crooning to herself the re- frain of an old love song. Dr. Dan laughed. j)  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7732-00000059"/> j L8       OPPORTUNITY. c' I always know that my kitten is comfortable when it begins to purr." The crooning ceased instantly.   "Don't you laugh at me too, Uncle!" "Why, my precious child, there is nothing I like better," the amused gentleman explained. "Except to hear you talk," he added. She looked up at him with such bright, undisguised pleasure in his approbation, and made an effort at con- versation from such a naive, evident desire tr do what he liked, that Dr. Dan was so charmed with the man- ner that he could scarcely answer the matter con- nectedly. In his shaded nook, Grahame became conscious that he was holding his breath in the intensity of his fas- cinated appreciation. But as she talked on he grew amazed, not only at her power of expression, but at her singular artistic perception. She was telling of her walk with Ben, of the autumn woods with their changeful hue of leaf and sky; and the man saw their glory and beauty through her mind's eye as he had never perceived it through his own. Then the con- versation branched off upon books, upon what should have been their aftrnoon's reading. "Harvey, how came this French novel here?" said her uncle at last, taking up one of the worst specimens of that class from the table at his side, and speaking with some reluctance. "I put it there," was the indifferent reply,   OPPORT UNITY- "Did you read it?" he asked, with attempted care- :essness, trying to avoid piqueing her curiosity if she had not done so. This was one of his permanent disagreements with his wife. "' If you must bring such things into the house, keep them in your own room, out of that child's way," he insisted. "I began it," Harvey answered, "but i really can- not read such vile stuff!" she exclaimed, in unmiti- gated disgust. Dr. Dan's face changed triumphantly; but he only said quietly,- "I might have known I could trust Margaret's child." "I have very little love for 'your scrofulous French novel, On gray paper, with blunt type; Do but glance at it, you grovel Hand and foot in Belial's gripe,'" repeated Harvey. "Where did you get that eminently correct descrip- tion?" he asked. Her eyes danced with mischief. "From your friend, Mr. Robert Browning," she answered demurely. "Well, well," replied Dr. Dan; with a laugh that acknowledged himself caugnht, i' then I grant that he has said one sensible tiling." Following the turn of the conversation, Grahame  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7732-00000060"/> 120        OPPORTUNITY. bethought himself of Sophia's account of Harvey's taste in reading, and smiled at the contrast. The servant knocking at the door a moment or two after, and announcing tea, the two walked away to- gether, talking as they went. Then Grahame rose also and left the room, but with somewhat different impressions from those with which he had entered it. , !    OPPORTUNITY.       121 CHAPTER    X. - b WY THEN Grahame reached the parlor, where tea was being handed, it gave him  a positive shock to find Harvey standing by her mother, looking precisely as she had done when he had last seen her in that room, - the same cold face and attitude of complete indifference to persons and-4tlfings around her. He did not know what change in her appear- ance he had counted upon, but he became conscious that he had expected a decided alteration. Almost every one had been served except the last-comers. Dr. Dan stood by the waiter helping himself, having just despatched a cup to his niece. Grahame intercepted the servant at the first step. Possessing himself of the tea, he walked up to Harvey, and silently offered. it to her. Tired. and thirsty, the girl really craved the beverage; yet her first un- governable impulse was to say carelessly, "I do not want any tea." But before the sentence could reach her lips, her swift, delicate perception had outstripped 'it. How she could not have told, but she was in- stantly aware of a change in the man who stood before her. Something in his manner which was not the polished courtesy of a gentleman, but the serious def- erence of the man, so impressed her, tliat, with a 76' ; .        'Vt  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7732-00000061"/> 122      ' OPPORTUNITY. slight,- grave bow, she put out her hand, and took the cup.' But though accepting his courtesy thus far, her manner effectually barred any further politeness he might have attempted.  Grahame could only turn away with an extreme sense of injury. Having en- tered so thoroughly, though surreptitiously, into lher inner life, he strongly resented being treated as utterly out of the pale. Although he smiled to himself the moment after at the absurdity of his expectatiqn, the sensation was none the less real while it lasted. "I will make to-morrow repay me for this, if it be possible," he was thinking, as he slowly returned to Dr, Dan's vicinity. There was much talking and laughing, singing and dancing that night, but Grahame found it all insuffer- ably stupid; especially as Harvey seemed to have absorbed her entire being into a good novel with such an evidently complete enjoyment as excited his pro- voked envy.  However, bedtime did at -last arrive; and the shooting next morning carried him up to the hour for which he had impatiently waited. Dr. Dan had lighted his cigar and settled himself in his arm-chair. The girl was, as usual, seated at his feet, leaning back against his knee for support. She had in her hand a volume of old English poems from which she was reading aloud, not only with truth to the idea and metrical form, but with that peculiar gift of voice which returnsi all impressions 'with the ex- quisite sensitiveness with which the wind-harp answers   I-'    '             '.,' i]:         OPPORTUNITY.        123 I to the wind.. Her position and occupation had so filled her with dreamy content, that she was scarcely i aware that some one had knocked, and that Dr. Dan I had said, "Come in," when Grahame Ferguson's voice startled her. I  "You see, Dr. Dan, I cannot resist your attrac- tion," it said, with a dextrous enlistment of the ; gentleman's well-known vanity which struck the speaker himself as rather mean. But it had the desired effect, for Dr. Dan turned around beaming with complaisance. The young man's desertion of the others for his sake flattered him ex- tremely; for that the child at his feet had any concern in the matter did not approach the border of his com- prehension. Her instinct had been to- rise instantly  and go ;but her uncle's hand, resting heavily upon her shoulder, kept her in her place. Grahame apparently I ignored her existence; and when Dr. Dan .handed A him his cigar-case, and told him which chair he would I find most comfortable, he took both, and began talking to his entertainer as though that were temporarily the I aim of his life. Harvey haughtily subsided into her K book.  The young man had seen too much of the I  world not to be able to talk well wlen he chose, and this afternoon 11ie chose with all his: ight and will. For some time his unwonted earnestness and brilliancy had little outward effect upon one of his auditors ; but, after a while, he saw the book drop towards her lap, and gradually the averted head turn, until, entirely "' ' i-,  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7732-00000062"/> 124        OPPORTUNITY. losing her self-consciousness, -she was looking up a him with those marvellous, changeful eyes, listenin with the appreciation of a woman, but with the seriou intentness of a child. It tasked to the uttermost Gre hame's acquired control of his manner to disguise hi intense consciousness of her, to cover his recognitio of every light and shade upon that face. Yet s accurately did instinct guide him, and so perfectl, did he sustain his part, that not even to the end di the girl's sensitive nerves awake to a suspicion of hi purpose. "Grahame," said Dr. Dan at last, after they ha talked for hours, and the young man had been givin a really fine account of some of his European adven tures, and literary and artistic acquaintances, " should think you had seen about enlough of the world Why don't you marry and settle down? Take m; advice and marry while you are young, while you car really make a choice and suitoyourself." I suppose Grahame Ferguson was no more obtus than most of us would have been in not recognizing the words of that fiery, bald-headed gentleman as th voice of his good angel; and yet, had he receive( them as such, there was even then a chance of hi becoming a true man, if never a great one. "What saith your prophet Shakespeare? 'A voun man married is a man that's marred,"' was the careless reply, as though the matter interested hin very slightly.   I,    OPPORTUNITY.         125 Dr. Dani made a dive at the book in Harvey's lap, turned the leaives hastily over, and then handed it back to heer, saying,- "Read that aloud." The girl's head  made a movement of decided refusal. "Nonsense, child, go on."; and thus adjured she went on.  It was Herrick's song:- "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Time is still a-flying; And this same flower that smiles to-day Tormorrow may be dying. "That glorious lamp of heaven, the sun, The higher he's a-getting, The sooner will his race be run, And nearer he.'s to setting. "The age is best which is the first, When youth and blood are warm}; But being spent, the worse and worst Time still succeeds the former. "Then be not coy, but use your time, And, while you may, go marry; For having once but lost your prime, You may forever tarry." The struggle between her habit of rendering what- ever she read with   exact expression, and her reso- lution to give this simply as an automaton moved by her uncle's will, struck Grahame's sense of humor acutely.    X  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7732-00000063"/> 126       -OPPORTUINITY. "We'll agree that the opposing testimonies balance or neutralize each other," he said with a laugh, when she had finished the poem which Dr. Dan had em- phasized -strongly with his hand, especially the last verse. "Single life and matrimony have always struck me as very much like the two roads of which the man said that each was so bad that, whichever you took, you would wish you had taken the other. How- ever, I am not a marrying man," he added, as though he wished to close a tiresome subject. He spoke the exact truth; marriage was the last thing lie desired or looked forward to, at least for years to come. "Really, r have been most charmingly enter- tained," said Dr. Dan, as their sitting broke -up, according the company his magnificent approbation. "Though - not Macheth's witches, when shall we three meet again?" laughed Grahame, with a keen eye to the wants of the morrow. "At the same hour and the same place until further notice. I repeat my standing invitation," was the answer he received, and just that which he desired. "We have not made much progress in our book, my dear; but then children learn as much by conversation 'as by reading," Dr. Dan gravely opined. The silent protest of Harvey's face, as she heard herself thus classified, so infinitely amused Grahame, that he was glad to get out into the hall to cover his laughter. Thus he gained a permanent and acknowledged place in these afternoon readings; which he soon con-   ?    -      OPPORTUNITY.        127 sidered the only part of the day during which he really lived; the rest he existed through as best he might. As he carefully followed his first line of tac- tics; and kept Dr. Dan skilfully in the foreground, i  the girl's defensive warfare ceased, for lack of oppor- tunity to fight. Insensibly she took her place in the conversation, until at last she talked as animatedly, upon general subjects, to the younger as to the older man. So new, so varied, so vivid was his intellectual enjoyment, so keen a stimulant did she supply to his satiated emotional nature, that he began to feel as though all his life he had been walking in semi-dark- ness, and had just emerged into the light.  More truly it was as though from living by flaming, garish gaslight he had come out into pure, fresh sunshine. Thus a week passed, the waning hours of each day of which seemed spent in an enchanted dream. Grahame's new fancy for literary seclusion' was strongly protested against by the rest of the company, but by nearly all of them set down to his well-known devotion to Dr. Dan.  As Harvey, outside of the office, kept strictly to her old avoidance of him, only two even among the ladies suspected the truth. Hen- rietta and Sophia each possessed dearly bought knowl-  edge of this man and his ways. Of what Miss Dan- gerfield thought or felt she gave no sign; but Sophia would have-died if she had not spoken. One morning she caught-Harvey in the empty parlor. . She began altering the arrangement of the chairs slightly, and  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7732-00000064"/> 128        OPPORTUNITY. replacing the books and ornaments on the table, as though that were her sole. purpose in coming into the room. "I suppose," she commenced presently, prefacing her remark with that little laughl which she considered sufficient cover for any abruptness, 1"Grahame Fergu- son is trying his old game upon a new object." The girl looked up rather wonderingly, but with the defensive, watchful expression springing up into eyes dangerously large and bright. The personal meaning of the remark she entirely failed to catch, but she fully appreciated the benevolent intention of the tone and manner. "You know he has spent his life in chaining cap- tives to his chariot-wheels," Mrs. Harvey went on, perceiving she mnust be more definite, "(and I only wish to inquire whether you have taken your place in that triumphal procession?" The unutterable degree of amused scorn into which the face seemed to sublimate overwhelmed Sophia with conscious defeat-without the other opening her lips. "Take care he does n't exhibit your scalp among his similar trophies next winter," she exclaimed, and retreated under cover of this final volley. It was well for Grahame that this little sceene had happened early in the morning, that the girl had many hours in which to calm down before they met. Even in the boundless self-reliance of youth, and inex-   OPPORTUNITY.        129 I perience and strong intellect, the bare possibility of I such remarks turned her hot and cold from head to foot. As it was, there was that afternoon a reaction into her early manner which required time, patience; I and much delicate endeavor on Grahame's part to remove. Ah, the wondrous fascination of these beautiful-) I uglywomen! To watch the loveliness they seem to i keep as too sacred for ordinary eyes slowly dawn, and  reach a divine perfection in your sight, what mortal I man can withstand that! If it be only a faint, mo- I mentary wild-rose flush upon the usually colorless cheek, a single flash or passing gleam in the lustreless  eyes, if you know it to be your very own, that yonu alone have created it, no glory of Greek art can so 6 stir you. This was the miracle Grahame wrought daily, and yet so differently that he waited each time - in expectancy as uncertain as intense. "This is the true essential beauty,"' he was tempted to exclaim. Another truth he awoke to, at least partially, as' he listened to her careless talking with an ever-increas- ing wonder. Not only was it that he recognized the absolute -originality and large structure of her mind, but that her thoughts seemed radiant with ' that - gleam that never was on sea or land," her sentences musical with nature's own harmony and melody. "I wonder if this be not genius," he would doubtfully ponder, with his suspicion mounting at times into triumphant conviction. But finding at such times IW     6^ x6  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7732-00000065"/> 130      - OPPORTUNITY. that- Dr. Dan appeared to take it all as a matter of course, he would fall into his old habit of accepting persons at the valuation put upon them by others, and'again become uncertain of the truth of his percep- tions. He was right,-- this was immature genius. Heaven, having used apparently all other influences in vain, had at last sent this man its rarest gift. But would even this avail to arrest his natural downward gravitation? - ah! would even this avail? About two weeks from  Grahame's coming, they were sitting together as usual one afternoon, when Dr. Dan was suddenly called away on professional business.      - "Wait until I come back. The place is very near, so I shall return almost immediately," he said in his peremptory way, as he left. Thus prevented from  leaving, as inevitably she would have done, the girl's baffled intention passed into her manner.  SlIe could at least absent her spirit. Consequently, she settled herself into Dr. Dan's vacant chair, and continued her reading as though entirely alone. For some time Grahame sat silently smoking, listening to the- ticking of the clock, which sounded with curious distinctness through the still room. Then he rose, as Harvey supposed, to leave. But it was only to pace slowly up and down the long room, as was so often his fashion.  Presently he stopped by the table at her elbow, to shake the ash of his cigar into the receiver. The slight action seemed to occupy an unusual length of -time.   OPPORTUNITY.        181 "What is it in me that you so object to?"Gra- hame suddenly asked, his voice breaking the silence rather startlingly. %&amp;ihe girl looked over her shoulder at him with a H(gular expression gathering in her face. "-Your Sultanic ways, for one thing," she replied. The man's large eyes grew larger. "If I unconsciously possess such, I scarcely think you have any reason to complain of them," he re- marked after a moment,  "It must be something more than that." ",You are lazy, self-conceited, and worthless," the clear young voice rang out, as though giving vent to some feeling long suppressed. Grahame's face flushed as perhaps in all his life it had never done before. "That is a hard judgment to pass upon one of whom you know so' little," he said presently, -with some dignity of manner, which, even in the midst of her heat and excitement, was not lost upon the girl. "I know you better than any one else; I have read you more thoroughly," she answered hurriedly. "You have wilfully thrown away time, talents, and oppor- tunity,- you havesacrificed all to the high pursuit of lady-killing; and this moment you have nothing to show as the result of your life. And to think what you might have beeirl-c o'nly to think what you might have been!

A light broke upon Grahame I "This girl is comparing the actual me with some ideal which she has faith enough to believe I could become; she is condemning my worse by right of my better self. I appear low and grovelling to her, be- cause she will measure me only by the highest stand- ard." For a little while his whole being seemed to rise to the demand; to be held as originally, worthy of heaven raised his nature again to the gates thereof, to be thought capable of a higher life awakened within him a divine need for it. The old sense of self-abasement swept over him like a flood, but with a different in- fluence. That which had hitherto been but as the waters of Abana and Pharpar, seemed now a spiritual Jordan with power to cleanse and heal. Yet even at this transcendent moment he could not divorce him- self from his individuality. In all his flattery-fed ex- istence, no such delicious pabulum had ever been offered his vanity as the passionate pain and wonder of the face opposite him. His recognition of this drew him earthward rapidly. "What would you have me do?" he said. "Whatever you can.  Anything is better than to rust away," she replied, finding it, like older, wiser people, much easier to state the disorder than to define the remedy. "You always remind me of Bettina's friend Rumohr."   OPPORTUNITY.       133 Grahame had not the remotest recollection of such an individual; but he looked as though he remem- bered him distinctly, as he quietly asked,-- "In what particular?" "He was dreadfully ill of neutrality." The words came to him as such an exact diagnosis of his own disease, that he sat and looked at her in astonishment. "There is nothing that you really care for," she 'went on. Had she been older or less intensely in earnest, the expression which came into his eyes at these last words would have stopped her; but she was far too absorbed to notice the change.           N "Perhaps that is no longer so, - perhaps there is now something for which I am beginning to really care," he was thinking. Douglas's parting words flashed upon him, -  unless some one of them is your salv&amp;- tion." Was it that the steady strength, the high, pure earnestness and enthusiasm of the face appeared to him just what he had all his life needed in himself, and vainly sought to supply from others? -was it this which made his brother's voice seem to sound suddenly in his ears? What 's the excitement now, little woman?"Dr. Dan exclaimed, as he bustled into the room. "Rather dangerous tone of voice that. You and Grahame have n't been quarrelling, I hope." "Miss Harvey has just been introducing me to  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7732-00000067"/> 134        OPPORTUNITY. some of Bettina's friends and acquaintances," Grahame answered coolly, with a laugh. "Ah, that accounts! Well, we won't have any more of that disagreeable German girl, if you please," the other answered, as he resumed his accustomed seat.  As for Harvey she took her usual place at his feet, but with her back to both gentlemen, and for the rest of the afternoon opened not her mouth.   'OPPORTUNITY.       135 CHAPTER    XI. BEFORE light the next morning, all the gentlemen, according to a previous arrangement, started off for the ducking shore. Late in the afternoon they re- turned with quite a numbelr of ducks, but with fewer  canvas-backs among them than they had hoped. Harvey was sitting by herself in the office, when, rec- ognizing Ben's step along the hall, she went to the door, and called him in. "O Harvey, we 've had such a grand time!" he ex- claimed, before she could ask any questions. "Was that the reason you stayed so long?" "Yes; we went farther than we expected,- nearer Mr. Ferguson's old home. And we met Douglas Fer- guson, his brother, and all the gentlemen who are staying with him." "Douglas, that sprightly Scot of Scots, who rides o' horseback up a hill perpendicular?" asked Harvey, laughingly, who did not know before that Grahame had a brother. "Yes, that's just what he can do," Ben answered simply; " but how did you know it?" "I learned it from Shakespeare," the girl replied with extreme amusement. "Oh!" said Ben, rather embarrassed at his mistake. n           ;  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7732-00000068"/> 136    .    OPPORTUNITY. "But you really ought to see him, he 's such a splen- did fellow; just what I call a man," he went on, re- gaining his self-possession in his enthusiasm. "Not handsome, you know, but-- " and here he gave a large wave of his hand, which she took to indicate in- definite grandeur of manner and presence. "Some- how he puts me in -mind of you, Harvey." "I am afraid Mr. Ferguson would protest if he heard you, Ben," laughed Harvey. "O no, he would n't, he has too much sense ; he's not a bit like this lazy, self-conceited brother of his, whom all these women are making such a precious fool of." Exactly her own adjectives of the evening before, and yet how strangely they struck her! A flush of anger passed over her. But the next moment she forgave Ben his lack of appreciation, with a rather con- temptuous pity for his immaturity. Still, her interest in the conversation was very much dampened, and she had no further curiosity about this very superior brother. "He says the canvas-backs are much more plenti- ful along the creek by his house," Ben continued, find- ing Harvey made no reply, "so he invited us all to come over to-morrow and stay two or three days." "Two or three days," the girl repeated, her face falling curiously.      r "Yes, and we're all going." She sat looking before her as though she were con- templating some rather dismal prospect.   OPPORTUNITY.       137 "It was vegry kind int him to invite me especially," remarked Ben. "I suppose, being so much younger than the rest, he was afraid I might not know whether I was included." "Ben, dear," said Harvey, coming slowly out of her abstraction, "they say when young gentlemen are on such parties they are not very careful as to what they do. Don't you get into any troulble, for my sake." "' I don't see how I can, except by getting shot or getting drunk. As for the bullets, we'll keep those for the birds; and as for the liquor, I will promise not to taste a drop while I am gone, if it will please you." "Thank you, Ben; it will please me very much," she returned, and he went off to change his muddy clothes. About noon next day, almost the entire male popu- lation of the house left for their visit to Douglas. Grahame had wandered round for a little while, hop- ing for a chance to bid Harv6y good by. But the girl was nowhere to be seen.; Consequently, he de- parted with a chilly sense of disappointment upon him, which gave him an inclination to find fault with all the arrangements for the expedition and every one con- nected with it. Perhaps his mood would have changed very materially could he have looked back through the curtains of one of those upper windows, and seen her standing, watching their going, with her lip caught under her teeth and a singular flush on the usually pale face.  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7732-00000069"/> 138        OPPORTUNITY. The visit proved a very pleasant one to all. But from first to last Douglas noticed an alteration in his brother from what he had been at their last meeting. The same self-contained indifference to things around him characterized his manner; but it evidently arose from another cause. Then it seemed want of occupation, now it seemed preoccupation. "Ridge, what do you suppose is the matter with Grahame?"Douglas asked, as the two happened to fall side by side in their homeward tramp after a day's sport; \the object of the remark moving on with some twenty others in front of them.  "Flirtation number one thousand and one, I suspect," Ridge answered. "Very likely," responded Douglas, and forgot the suggestion the next moment, ,to remember it years upon years after. It was the last night of their stay, and they had come home to a smoking supper of all the good things natural to the season, an d this unequalled region of country. They had done ample justice to Douglas's capital cheer, and the cigars, and whiskey, and so forth, were in full sway. This had been going on for hours, and some of the younger men had become rather excited. Ben Brent was seated near one end of the table, and next him an individual of this class. "Come, my boy, fill up your glass, and drink"; he exclaimed, clapping Ben on the shoulder.   OPPORTUNITY.       139 "Not any, thank you," he quietly answered, as the other lifted the bottle. "Nonsense; you must," the man persisted with vinous cordiality, and, though the boy again steadily refused, continued to press him with a loud, tipsy good-nature, which drew the attention of the whole company upon them. Ben's face turned crimson with the keen annoyance of a half-grown boy, awkwardly placed among a party of full-grown men, opposing their habits and customs. He was divided between an extreme desire to sink through the floor, and a still stronger inclination to fight them all, individually and collectively. "Bravo, youngster!"Douglas's rich, clear voice sounded down the table; "so you can say 'No'! Upon my word, I thought that race of boys had died out; I drink to its rediscovery!" and he bowed with ,as grand a courtesy as though he had bent before a young prince. -Every glass at the table went up, and Ben found himself suddenly lifted from the position of a foolish, verdant youth into that of a small hero. The angry flush in his face changed to an equally deep blush of embarrassed pleasure and gratitude. In return, he bowed with some of Douglas's own man- ner, but said nothing. Their plan for going home was to walk the ten miles back, using their guns upon the partridges as they went. Breakfast being over, they dispersed about the hall and porch, taking a farewell drink and  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7732-00000070"/> 1t0        OPPORTUNITY. l'ghting their cigars before starting. Douglas had gone into the empty dining-room, and was standing :by the sideboard pouring out a glass of wine, when Ben came and stood1eside- him. "Mr. Ferguson,"9 he said, rather hesitatingly, look- ing- down with a boyish modesty, which, awkward as it was,- became him very well, "I was very much obliged to you last nilght." "Why, my boy, I think, as I said then, the obliga- tion was quite the other way," Douglas answered- cheerily. "You see it was a promise,"  Ben explained, becoming more at his ease under the influence of the- other's manner, "' so what could I do? i' "Ah!" said Douglas slowly, and touching the boy's cheek, he turned the face to the light, gazing at- it with a curious smile upon his lips; "then you are a gentleman, and know the value of your word!"  Had Douglas Ferguson been a crowned king, and the other his kneeling subject,--whom, with the ac- colade, he had charged in the name of St. Andrew, St. Michael, and St. George to be honest, -courteous, and loyal, -- he could no more have inducted him into the order of chivalrous knighthood, than he had by that one sentence. The boy's immature, impression- able nature -crystallized into indestructible purity and truth in that single moment. "-I' -hope the person who -holds your promise is worthy of such a true knight," the elder gentleman added pleasantly.   OPPORTUNTY.        141 "Worthy! ' exclaimed Ben, with amused astonish- ment; " why, it's Harvey, - Harvey Berney!" '- And thus it was that Douglas Ferguson first heard the name of the woman who, until the day -of his death, was to stand to him apart from all other wo- men upon whom the sun shone. - How it' all came back to him, when for the first time he saw her face to face,--the chill, misty morning, the aroma of the wine in his hand, the enthusiasm of the boy's upward look, -how it all came back to him! "And who is he, -Damon to your Pythias?" he inquired rather carelessly. "O no!" laughed the boy; "it's a girl, -it's Dr. Dan's niece.." The smile on Mr. Ferguson's lips deepened at what he thought a very pretty instance of boy and girl love. "I am sorry I can't ask you to join me in drink- ing both your healths, which I do myself most sincerely," he said, kindly; and setting down the empty glass, the two passed out into the hall. He found his guests, on the porch just ready to start. "Douglas," said Grahame, as he bade him good by, "can't you come over and stay with us for at least a day or two? Ridge is certainly enough at home here to perform all your duties as host, and Sophia and Dr. Dan both charged me to beg you to come." "Mydear fellow,"-exclaimed his brother, lifting his hands in a horror which was part mockl and part real, "ask me to storm a battery, or to make you a present  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7732-00000071"/> "2        OPPORTUNITY. of all I am worth, and for your sake I might be induced to do it; but don't beg me to go into a house full 'of women, for that I cannot do. Why, that Sophia alone would finish me in half an hour." "Well," returned Grahame, laughingly, "I have executed my commission. But you had better think over it, and decide differently." Douglas's face gave 'such a ridiculously forcible negative, that further discussion of the subject -was evidently useless. He little dreamed, as he stood on that porch, waving his hand to them as they. went gayly down the old lilac-hedged walk to the gate, that in the previous moment he had thrown away a chance of perfect earthly happiness for his whole life; he little imagined that a time was coming when he could only think of this hour with a mad impulse to curse God and, die. The partridges that morning proved so abundant, and consequently the gentlemen's detours and loiter- ings by the way-so frequent, that when they reached Bonbrook, the early winter twilight was closing down upon it. As their sharpened appetites had first to be satisfied, and- their toilets rearranged, Grahame found the parlor bright with candle-light when he entered it. There were perhaps a dozen persons standing around the fire, most of them ladies, who received him with merry, demonstrative cordiality. In the midst of returning it, he became aware of a    OPPORTUNITY.       143 dark figure standing at the .farthest window, with its back towards them. Who it was he well knew. An intense desire to see what welcome he could win from her instantly possessed him. He was sure his reception would be passively, if not aggressively, cold and disdainful; yet he could not resist the attrac- tion. As soon as he could disengage himself from the group, he came up the room in a state of -being which - wasl outwardly deference and inwardly nervousness. Reaching her side, he stood for a moment, not daring to accentuate the claim his presence made upon her at- tention. The girl turned slightly towards him, it almost seemed magnetically drawn; and thus he saw her face. It absolutely dazzled him. The glad light which was unconsciously welling up from the unfath- omable depths of her eyes had floated over her whole countenance, covering it with such a radiance that it . seemed to look out at him from a golden mist. In that following second, Grahame Ferguson reached and fulfilled his uttermost capacity for life and happiness. He could only think of it afterwards as a divine delir- ium in which he had been caught up for an instant from earth to heaven. He had no words meet- for such a moment, and he had little time allowed him for their discovery; for, almost before he perceived it, Harvey passed him, and went out by the nearest - door, drawing- from him his preternatural vitality as suddenly as she had endowed him with it.

The girl hurried on to her room, and Miss Danger- field swept gracefully down stairs. A strange sense of satisfaction had sprung up in her heart as she looked at Harvey. "Another specimen of Grahame Ferguson's skill,"  she was thinking, as she moved on. "Well, it is just  and - right that other women should at least taste the cup which I have been forced to drain to its dregs, that I should not be alone in my humiliation."  She had made her toilet that evening under th in- fluence of his probable return, determined to compel temporarily his old admiration, if, as she knew, she could win nothing more. The heavy crimson silk swept down in fold4whose pure line of curve was un- broken by flounce or furbelow, while its deep color gave a subtile warmth and glow to her exquisite beauty, which was its sole need. Black lace alone, with its delicate web and falling grace, softened her costume. No other ornament was visible; not even upon the a.

Excited and absorbed as he had been scarcely a mo- ment before -by another influence, it was not in mas- culine vanity to resist such an appeal. So he, leaned upon-lthe piano-at -her side, and looked and listened. He was still too strongly under the influence of the previous spell to do more than retain his place, and occasionally assent to the soft, slowly syllabled sen- tences which fell at intervals from Henrietta's coral lips; but he did this so perfectly that nothing more seemed needed. - After some time, tea was handed. IHe was watch- ing Miss Dangerfield sip her's, when Harvey and her mother came in very quietly, and took their seats at the other end of the room. Henrietta marked by the indefinable change in Grahame's eyes the exact mo- ment at which he perceived their presence; and she felt that her hour was over. The full glory of the look which he had seen at its climacteric moment had, of course, passed from Har- vey's face; but even the lingering radiance of its faded light was sufficient to still transform her countenance, all unconscious of it as she was. 'Had she been an &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7732-00000073"/> "6        OPPORTUNITY. older woman, she never would have dared to lay bare that face for the reading of the eyes that looked at her; or at least, had she done so, she would have rec- ognized and used its wondrous power. So young, --oh, so piteously young! That alone might have touched his- mercy, instead of merely -stirring his cesthetic nature; for that alone he might have spared her. But what has ever been held sacred by the conscienceless selfishness of an ennuyed man's hungry vanity? Gra- hame looked at Harvey; Henrietta looked at Gra- hame,--looked and learned. A wild despair took possession of the woman. The beauty she had loved and gloried in a moment before for its fancied power over him, she now hated and despised, as she realized its impotence. What could azure light of eye and golden light of locks avail against the magic brilliancy of that pale, dark face? She saw that her very perfec- tion of form condemned her to monotony, as the very irregularity of the other conferred upon her the capaci- ty of perennial variety. Then she saw that the merely external must ever give way before that which springs from within; that the material - be it in ever so- ex- quisite, so 'sublimated, a form - must stand confessed of all its weakness and inferiority before the spiritual. Sitting there in her completeness of beauty, talent, and elegance, from her soul she envied this ugly, immature girl her very ugliness and immaturity.

Presently, after Grahame had forgotten to say anything for some five minutes, Miss Dangerfield said, speaking as though she were viewing Harvey from serene, immeasurable, glacial height,- "As you seem fond of Hebrew comparisons for your little friend, I will furnish you with another. She seems  to me a pillar of fire by night and of cloud by day." i As was often the case with him when more struck by a remark than he cared to admit, Grahame only looked from one to the other and smiled; but he thought of it afterwards, as at times the most appro-. priate description of Harvey. After breakfast, some one remarking that it was an uncommonly favorable day for the ducks, the male visitors all started for the shore, promising, though, to return early. But evening came, and still they did not makle their appearance. Thle ladies, who had con- gregated- ilnhe parlor after dinner, sat about the room dozing or talking, wondering from time to time, at first listlessly, but gradually with more earnestness, what could have become of them. Suddenly there was a dull, heavy sound of footsteps upon the porch outside, totally unaccompanied by the noise and excited laughter which usually heralded the return of the shooting party. Perhaps it was this that made them all sit still and listen, with surprise  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7732-00000075"/> 150        OPPORTUNITY. which deepened rapidly into a strange apprehension, a vague sense of coming evil. Then they heard the nail door open, and footsteps enter. Sophia sprang up, and opened the parlor door; the rest following, Hen- rietta and Harvey immediately behind her. Upon a board lay, partially covered, what was apparently the dead body of a man. Thus Grahame Ferguson was brought into the presence of the three women who, each in her own way, loved him. From Sophia's lips there came a great shriek of womanish terror, while such a pang of agony wrung that shallow, selfish heart as few would have believed it capable of enduring. In that single second, there came back to Henrietta Dangerfield the perfect and vivid memory of every look, word, feeling, or event connected with this man, from the evil day upon which she had first seen him until the present moment; just as men partially drowned tell us that their whole lives seemed pictured before them as they sank for the last time. She made a vague step forward with some wild purpose, as she afterwards believed, of casting herself down by that seeming corpse, and there crying out before heaven and earth, lavishing upon the dead man that love to which he had been almost as insensible while living. As for Harvey Berney, she had no past to go back to, and at that moment she seemed to have no future. Her road of life, just begun, appeared to her to end at j that rude bier. "Sophia, hush!" cried Dr. Dan, with that voice   OPPORTUNITY.       151 which he seldom used, but which always made the servants announce to each other that Dr. Dan's sperit was up7 "The boy is not dead, nor likely to die; he has only fainted from loss of blood. But I can't have noise and excitement around him. Camy him up to his room," he said to the men; 4 I will be there in one moment. And now,-ladies," he added, laying his hand on his. wife'si shoulder, and indicating the rest of his sentence conclusively by the way in which he turned her face towards the parlor, and walked her into it. The rest'obeyed mechanically; and in a moment more he had satisfactorily shut them in, and gone back to Grahame.   Dr. Dan had told them the exact truth concerning the wounded man's condition.  He had accidentally received a charge of duck-shot in the upper part of his left arm, severely tearing the flesh, though the bone escaped fracture. The vicinity of the wound to the great arteries had led to a danger- ous degree of bleeding, which, added to the fatigue and pain of being brought home, had reduced to its present state a frame never strong in proportion to its size, a vitality never superabundant. The fright- ened women sat about- the parlor, talking, when they spoke at all, in terrified half-whispers, and listening and waiting for some  news from above stairs. This' continued for perhaps an hour, when Dr. Dan and most of the gentlemen came down; announcing that the patient was doing well, and likely to do still better, if they could but keep off the fever which most prob-  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7732-00000076"/> 152        OPPORTUNITY. ably would supervene. Freed ifrom the restraint of their fear, most of the ladies poured out a flood of in- quiries as to the particulars of the accident. But, curious as Sophia naturally was, on this occasion she only broke out into nervous laughter, and allowed com- parative strangers to do all the questioning. Neither Henrietta nor Harvey could have spoken, had their lives depended upon it; but each drew a long, sigh- ing breath as Dr. Dan gave ilis favorable judgment, as though neither had really breathed since they last heard him speak. If Grahame had been the centre of attraction be- fore, what he now was I can scarcely tell. The whole excitement of the house gathered round that sick- room. The ladies spent their entire time in devising means to arouse his appetite and interest. The men willingly sacrificed the shooting to stay at home to nurse and entertain him, - the volunteers: for this duty being always a greater number than could be ac- cepted. His apartment was the most popular in the house.   Almost every one found his or her -way thither during some portion of the day, with kind words; or service. Even Henrietta would come in behind Mrs. Harvey, and stand by his bedside for a moment or two, uttering  a few silvery sentences, seeming to lower the temperature of the room by her mere presence, but with flickering gleams of her old self in face and manner very curious to trace, had any one been sufficiently interested to do so. A r l   OPPORTUNITY.        l One person only never came.  Had Harvey beer dead, Grahame could have seen or bhea'd no less ol her. Listen as he would, and lie spent most of his time in that ccupation, he could not catch the sound Of either her voice or her step. She was too unim- portant a person in the house for him to gather any- thing concerning her from the conversation of those around him, and somehow he could not bring himself to ask direct questions of Dr. Dan. e commenced to wonder if she possibly could have gone home, but her mother's occasional presence in his chamber reas- sured him on that point. The strain on Grahame's nerves and temper began to show. H e grew decidedly' cross, and much more uncivil to those around him than could have been suspected of so polished a gen- tieman. Deprived of the single thing he really de- sired, the unlimited supply of everything he did not care for seemed only to aggravate him. Before two weeks had passed, his nurses began to find their task theofaruS to hT w   !eeless "O "' to of e  ntertaining him no lig ht one, and to have various beautiful illusions concerning Mr . Ferguson's suave imperturbability somewhat damaged. If Dr. Dan had not allowed his patient an unlimited number of cigars (choosing between them and a nervous fever), Gra- hame could scarcely have existed through his itpris- onment. As it was, he made the elder gentlemen's life a burden to him with his ceaseless questions as to the earliest possible moment at which he could go down stairs.   &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7732-00000077"/> 154        OPPORTUNITY. , And Harvey? Night after night a figure would 'stand on the porch below Grahame's window, gaz- ing, gazing at the light that shone in it; a woman's figure, with the fervid imagination within exaggerating his suffering a hundred-fold, and the throbbing heart 'only aching, longing, to endure it in his stead. Day after day that same figure would sit wearily in the old office without even a pretence of employment, listen- ing, listening for every sound in the sick-room overhead, and feeling as though the occupation taxed to its utmost every faculty of her being. Yet so intense, so irradi- cable was the pride and reticence of her nature, that, not even in that seclusion, did she ever mention his name to Dr. Dan, did she ever make one inquiry as to his condition. To be sure, as the ladies talked of little else, by closely attending to their conversation at the table she gained frequent and accurate ac- counts df him; but, had such not been the case, she must have acted just as she did. Had any one told Harvey that all this torturing sorrow and unrest was love, she would have heard in utter unbelief and amazement. What! this the dream of bliss she had shyly and vaguely imagined might one daybe hers? this the heaven on earth into which all her heroines had enterede? this the power which was to glorify her life, to endow it with eternal beauty and freshness? The idea of associating the two never dawned upon hie mind. With her vivid imagination so filled with a preconceived ideal, it was small wonder that she   OPPORTUNITY.        155 failed to recognize a reality which was the other ex- treme of sensation and emotion. The fact that she was nearly all day alone and unoccupied added not a little to her suffering; or, rather, gave it room for full development. Even Ben's rough kindness and com- panionship were now lacking; for the boy had gone, with his family, to live in a distant city. Owing to Grahame's accident and the unusual prevalence of sickness in the neighborhood, Dr. Dan had much less time for his pet than he customarily bestowed upon her. The readings were very few and far between. The only time she was sure to see him was for about an hour every evening at twilight, when he would sit smoking over. the office fire with her head resting upon his knee, or lying upon his shoulder. This little interval of peace and enjoyment he swore roundly he would not give up if every man in the county died for want of attention. The two were generally very silent at these times. The gentleman, from fatigue and perfect contentment at his position, did not care to talk; and the girl seemed to have lost entirely the merry excitement and flow of spirits which usually claimed expression in words as a relief and a pleasure. "What an impatient fellow that'is!" laughed Dr. Dan, as they thus sat one Saturday night, and the sound of a chair being kicked suddenly across the floor above them broke the stillness.  "I shall not be able to keep him up there more than a I             '           ..  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7732-00000078"/> 156       OPPORTUNITY. fewdays longer. If he were a little stronger, and could get at his clothes, I should have to lock him in now. After he gets down, I shall have to shut him up here for safe-keeping; for now that Soplia and the rest of -those women have nursed him well, they will nurse 'illim sick again for the excitement of the thing. But lyou and I will treat him to a little judicious sternness, -- won't we, little woman?" Harvey's throat and mouth felt so unnaturally hard and dry that she did not attempt to answer. Sh only turned her face closer to his shoulder, to throw it into deeper shadow, and hide the hot flush which was upon it. Dr. Dan naturally istook te action for one of those little impulsive movements by which she often expressed a tenderness she was too proud to put into words. He slightly beht his head to kiss sciously closened its pressure around hertal; but he made no comment in words, and went on talking of his patient up stairs. But the girl still making no audible reply they dropped again into silence, which remained unbroken until some outside demand upon him forced him to go. The next morning rose so clear and bright that all the ladies, and nearly all the gentlemen, around the breakfast-table announced their determination to ride over to church. As it was no longer early, there was for some tithe the slight noise and confusion of hasty dressing.' Then several vehicles drove away, -i r!'.   OPPORTUNITY.       157 and many riding-horses clattered after them, leaving the house to such unusual solitude and quietness as gave it a Sabbatical aspect 'and feeling. Harvey was the only white female left on the premises. It must be confessed that she never went to church, ex- cept occasionally to gratify her mother, who-wise- good mother that she was--did not press the point. But Dr. Dan, who, as I have said, considered religion a noun strictly of t he feminine gender, took her con- duct in this'matter quite to heart, and also undertook to lecture her on it. "But, Uncle," Harvey would pathetically urge in reply, " I don't like going to church. It always makes my head ache; and, besides, - it bores me." Dr. Dan scarcely liked to meet Harvey's eyes as she naively offered this last objection; for he had felt its full force in his own case. "My dear, my dear," he would reply, with a stately wave of his hand, which was meant to indicate that to answer such trivial remarks was quite beneath his dignity, "a woman  without religion is a flower without perfume." To which the girl would respond, with some youth- ful scorn, that she by no means aspired to the odor of sanctity. Dr. Dan would then intimate that perhaps it would be better for her if she did. "Very well, Uncle," Harvey would return, her eyes growing into great dancing stars, as she played out the trump card she always held in reserve, "if i  'I.  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7732-00000079"/> 158      (OPPORTUNITY. church-going is such a got thing for me, why isn't it so for you?

Her sleep having changed from the calm repose of a child to the broken rest of a sore-hearted woman, she was apt to gain most of it after light. There could be no surer proof tliat she had passed the Rubicon of her life than the fact that she had unconsciously adopted the means by which all miserable women seek to shorten their wretched days, - by beginning each one at the latest possible moment. Having lingered over her breakfast as long as she could, and having eaten little or nothing in the end, she walked away to the office with two books in her hand, over which she often spent her Sundays, - Tennyson's poems and her Bible. Being of her age and temperament, the first was for the time her natural form  of speech;. being of' her intel- lectual calibre, the truth and grandeur and poetry of, the last was the food which both heart and head demanded then and always. Coming through the door, and closing it behind her, she passed listlessly on until she was midway up the room. Then she glanced up, and, for a moment, stood perfectly still, with a face which was first white, then crimson, then white again, with a heart which was beating with slow, heavy strokes that,                .  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7732-00000080"/> 56Q       OPPORTUNITY. seemed to tear her breast. Upon a sofa between the fire and the window lay Grahame Ferguson, pale and thin, but dressed with scrupulous care, and w ith every point which had ever made his appearance ef- ; fective thrown into strong relief. Without the slight- est salutation, Harvey turned abruptly, and retraced her steps. But Grahame had not thought out this scene over and over again for the past week without closely calculating all its probabilities, and preparing his line of conduct to suit any of the moods in which he had ever seen her. , Miss- Harvey, will you bring me a glass of water? fell upon the girl's ear as she reached the door. r -e was very much overcome by the exertion of dressing and descending, so the faintness and weak- ness expressed in his voice was-not all delicate acting Harvey halted irresolutely, and glanced over her shoulder' at him to see if the face corresponded with the tone. He had talken care that it should do so per- fectly. With the ueerring intuition with which some men read women, he ha appealed directly to that in- finite depth of womanly tenderness for all pain and sorrow and weariness which he knew to be really the truest andlargest element of a nature in which pride was apparently the master passion. By going deeper than any outward seeming, he completely undermined that which would have resisted only more and more strongly all external attacks. Harveymade her exit without the slightest reply; and Grahame half started   OPPORTUNITY.      161 up with something like an oath of impatience and dis- appointment. But he fell back in spite of himself, sick from the sudden movement. It was well for his plan that he did so; for in a moment she had returned with the water. He took it from her hand, and sip- ped it very slowly; she standing by the couch, look- ing down at him, tracing the work of the past two weeks upon him, softening more and more visibly as she saw how white and weak he was. (" I ad jt quite as strong as I imagined;. but it was so lonely ll irs," he said wearily, as he handed her back the gl' Harvey  jk her colors instantly. 'A"Wd  o^HKdo for you?" she asked, with that low, unste-y, Hager tone in her voice which emotion always brought into it. "Sit down, and talk to me,"  he answered quickly, venturing for the first time upon a faint smile; and with his well arm he attempted to draw a low seat to the side of the sofa. Harvey sat down. But having done so, the color began to flush again over her face, and she did not seem to know what to say next. "What books are those yon have there?" asked Grahame, whose age, experience, and previous prepa- ration gave him just the calmness and ease the oc- casion required. She silently handed them to him. Reading their titles, he opened them, and noticed that the leaves of  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7732-00000081"/> 162        OPPORTUNITY. the Tennyson fell apart naturally at "Mariana," and ' that the mark in the Bible was -at Ecclesiastes. "Rather singular spiritual food for you,--is n't it?" he asked,- with mingled surprise and amusement, as he showed her the pages. ," I don't know," she answered hurriedly, with her voice still not quite under her control, "I often read them on Sunday." "Suppose you read them to me to-day," he pro- posed. She caught at the idea eagerly, as a relief to her embarrassment. The Tennyson happened to be near- est her, and she took it up first. As she went on from poem to poem, she grew first composed, and then easy, excited, and brilliant. Interspersing her reading with long intervals of talk, each forgot all else in the intense enjoyment of the moment. But soon their spiritual harmony grew to be such that the girl volun- tarily unfolded a division of her nature he had never before seen, admitted him to a holy of holies whose existence he had not previously known, much less had his feet entered. She threw aside the merely human words, however true and beautiful, and turned in- stinctively to the Word of Life. There she read the loftier Psalms, unconsciously almost chanting them, it seemed to Grahame; then the sublime utterances of Job, of Moses, of Isaiah, which seemed to excite her like grand organ music. To the man it was an absolute revelation. He had looked upon reading the   ?OPPORTUNITY. Scriptures ,as the proper ceremonial of churches and pulpits; but that its private p rusal could be anything but a penanea, a medicine for the soul as unpleasant as it might be wholesome, had never occurred to him. That, apart from its moral and spiritual value, the keenest intellectual enjoyment may be obtained from it, and obtained nowhere else in such a degree, now appeared to him for the first time. Ihave ever known a weak man, however good, who did justice to the Old Testament, as I have known strong, wicked men to whom it was a ceaseless source of entertain- ment and admiration. But what struck Grahame most forcibly uwas the different effect it had upon himself and upon her. With him, it was mere appreciation; with her, it was instinctive, unconsci ous correspondence of bein,. S e was breathing her native element, he was striving for t breath in a too rare atmosphere. The contrast de- pressed him terribly, made him feel weak and meagre- natured to a heart-sickening degree, which, added to his physical condition, utterly wore him out. Harvey had ceased reading, and was carelessly turn- Mng over the leaves of her Bible, when she came upon the sixth chapter of Hosea, whose first si x verses, it had  always seemed to her, would be snfficient to fee(,l one's inner life u pon, were all other holy writings lost. She instantly began it, and read on, just as she had been doing all the morning , u ntil she reached the fourth verse, when the voice, meaning, look, e x- lo!   x  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7732-00000082"/> 164        OPPORTUNITY. pression of the whole wfaman changed as though by magic.             to t   0 "O Ephraim! what shall I do ,rto thee?

Had she called upon him by name, had she cried to him, in her own fervid, broken sentences, to save his soul alive, she could have made no more personal appgal than she did by that Hebrew adjura- tion of thousands of years ago. The next moment the old, shy, haughty, defiant embarrassment seized hold upon her. The blood rushed stormily up over throat and face. She turned her head abruptly away, and sat looking fixedly before her, resolved that the hot tears in her eyes should not fall, antd hoping that each breath which came would be a less acute "o I am giving that'which is holy to dogs, she was fierely tlinking., "I am amusing and exciting this a as any actress might do. I am weaker and more contemptible than he, to exhibit all this to his careless, patronizing gaze." But struggle as she might to regain her equilibrium, it was nearly five minutes before she could turn with her eyes broad open and bright to meet those which   OPPORTUNITY.       165 she expected to see ,filled with that curious smile she had so often watched in them. Grahame was lying upon his side, with (his hands covering his face, and through the thin, delicate fingers she saw tears steal- ing. With this woman it was nothing or all. This royal nature kept back no part of the price. In another second she was down upon her knees by his side, in an agony of contrition and self-reproach. "Forgive me, O forgive me! I thought you would laugh, I thought you did not care," she was crying  out with passionate incoherence, " only forgive me!" and the voice died away in inarticulat6ipleading. There are very few men who caqnot look back upon moments in which- they ow see that Fate stood hold- ing her richest gifts i her hand, kseeming to say, "Come, then, if you are worthy and -capable of it, seize what I place within'your reach, and henceforth live happy and triumphant upon the gain of this single victory." The strong, the clear-sighted, the fortunate, - and the selfish comprehend and answer this invitation, and go through life rejoicing in their reward. But the weak, -ah me! the weak do just what they al-'  ways do, let their chance drift from their grasp, only to awake to their loss and mourn it jwhen too late. Had Grahame Ferguson uttered in rep)ly to that girl's entreaty the words that trembled on his lips, had he said, "I care not only for this, but I care for you; take me, wretched as I am, and make me what  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7732-00000083"/> 166       ' OPPORTUNITY. you think me capable of," she would have cast un- hesitatingly the rich largess of her whole being at his feet, would have devoted utterly her woman's heart and man's brain to his service, would have consecrated all the wondrous gifts with which God had endowed her to the redemption of one human soul. But - he hesitated. He was sure neither of her nor of him- self. Perhaps Providence interposed, taking care of His own, having other work for Harvey Berney to do than to spend her life in dwarfing her nature to match that of the weak man she loved. Perhaps the Creator would allow no such waste of his own noble creation. The delay proved decisive. Dr. Dan's voice sound- ed by the window, calling to the servant to take his horse; and-in a moment more his step was by the upper door of the office. In a second Harv'ey had sprung to her feet, and had passed out of the entrance at the rear. How completely Grahame's social drill had become second nature was proved by the way in which, without an instant's thought, he turned away from the light, and, placing his hand over his eyes? feigned sleep perfectly. A rather blasphemous exclamation rose to Dr. Dan's lips, as he caught sight of his patient. But the sup- posed slumber somewhat modified him. "Been reading himself into a faver, though, I'll warrant," he muttered, as he noticed the books Har- vey had let drop; "yes, a most decided fever," he   OPPORTUNITY.       167 167 went on, as he cautiously touched the pulse in the arm nearest him, and again felt very much like swearing. 4' However, I 'II get him up stairs as soon as he wakes, before any of these women knQw he is down "; and some half an hour after he succeeded in his design. -Al,  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7732-00000084"/> 168        OPPORTUNITY . CHAPTER    XIII.  jHE next afternoon, as none of Dr. Dan's patients  were at the point of death, he carried Harvey off from the dinner-table as of old, and decreed a  regular reading.      , In his room above stairs Grahame listened and   : waited until the sounds rising from below assured him  that the whole company had settled to their after-  dinner occupations and recreations. Then he de- scended, opened the office door, and walked in. Dr.  Dan stared at him for a moment, and then per- emptorily ordered him back to his room. But tho young man coolly made his way to the sofa, intimating that it was decidedly the nearest place of repose, and that he had not strength to go farther. As the plea had somewhat the appearance of truth, Dr. Dan was forced to admit it. If a slight movement of the eyelids can be called a salutation, then Grahame might consider his smile and bow to Harvey as answered; for it was all he obtained in return. Intense self-consciousness and inward weakness made her outwardly cold, hard, and haighty to extreme rudeness. To prevent the trembling faint- ness which was at her heart from reaching voice and manner, both had to be held icebound.   OPPORTUNITY.       169 "Read on, child," said Dr. Dan, as soon as Grahame had made himself comfortable; and she obeyed. Under the cover of her voice, Harvey thought her own thoughts and made her own observations. As she did so, a bright red spot began to grow in either cheek,yand the e 'yes that were fastened on the book were- unnecessarily brilliant.  Was it only the girl's morbidly sensitive pride and excited imagination which produced this effect, or wae there really a shade ill Grahame's manner whicl justified this feeling ? Perhaps it was both. Is it ever quite safe to utterly surrender except to the verystrong?  Is not a certain smallness of nature, a certain tendency to petty tyranny and triumnll, inseparable from weakness? I am afraid so. At least thus Harvey was thinking as she sat there filled with fierce anger and scorn for the man in whose eyes she thought she read this ex~ pression, witlh boundless self-contempthfor ever having afforded him cause for such self-glorification.  The memory of how she had knelt by his side at that very couch only the day before, of how she had cast her whole being at his feet in lowly abasement as she sued for pardon, - this recollection, instead of bringing with it the corresponding remembrance of an infinite love. and tenderness and protection with which a nobler nature would have received it, now smote her like a blow full in the face, seeming to brand her cheek with eternal shame.  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7732-00000085"/> 170        OPPORTUNXTY. Steadily but mechanically she read on; though the words failed as entirely in reaching her comprehension as they did that of the man upon the sofa. Her man-  ner! at his entrance had only been what he expected or, rather, feared; but the change which had since come over it startled, angered, and confounded him. The lower part of his nature was roused with an irritated, mortified sense of defeat, while from his better self was developed honest sore-heartedness and vague dread that in some unaccountable way he had lost his hold upon that to which it most behooved him to cling as he valued his salvation for this world and -the (next., What he had done or said in a single pas- sive hour to warrant her wrathful -contempt he could not understand; but he struggled vainly against a feel- ing that he deserved it.       - The twilight was gathering; and Harvey, who dreaded any break in the proceedings which might necessitate conversation, had turned her book from the window to the fire, and was reading by its light, when the door opened, a head was put in, a voice ex- -claimed, "Ah, here he is! I told you so "; and the speaker, Mrs. Harvey, came into the room, drawing Htenrietta after her. t "We. went. up stairs to pay you a visit, Mr. Fer- guson," Sophia volubly went on, seeming, as she always did, to take possession of, if not to occupy, the entire apartment, " and when we found the cage empty we .knew directly where t6i look for the bird."   OPPORTUNITy.       i71 She felt more than doubtful of her reeption fom each one of'them, and therefore attempted to supply cordialityenough for the whole party. Dr. Dan had turned round in amazed disgust at this unwonted in- trusion; but  as it was not within the bounds of po ssi- bility to order one's wife or ones guests out of any room they chose to enter, he moved his whole estab- lishment himself, hl ' easy-chair, ad Harvey.). to the other side of the fire, and there smoked in savage silencer            sa Sophia and Henrietta came up to Grahame's sofa; and that gentleman, rising from his recumbent posi- tion, offered them a seat -on either sideof him.

Such an appeal from  a womnan Grahame Ferguson had never been able to resist, so he was soon gayly and gallantly en- tertaining the new-comers in a way which certainlfy-- would not have led them  to suspect that at the m o- ment of  their entrance he had fervently wished them at the end of the world. B ut there were two other causes which gave his words a brilliancy, and his manner a softnessand em- pressement, which few women could have resisted. One thing both he an d Ha rvey had noticed in a second, , Henrietta had never looked m ore beautiful in her life. More than this, the sapphire eyes shone brightly, the  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7732-00000086"/> 172        OPPORTUNITY. rosy lips smiled sweetly, and he knew that it was for him'that they thus changed. In itself alone this would have struck and sounded that vanity, deep if unde- monstrative, which was the key-note of his character; but that Harvey should witness and comprehend it thoroughly, as he well knew she did, was truly   d a delightful salve to the stinging blow she had just given that same susceptible feeling. Instinctively and eagerly he did his utmost to lead Henrietta uncon- sciously on; his manner went back to what it had been during the first day after his coming to this house, and produced just the result which had theni followed. Now, as always, he used this woman's heart simply for his own convenience; playing upon her emotional nature with that calm, unconscious, ruthless selfish- ness which characterized him in all things, being sim- ply so absorbed in himself as to have no thought left for the consideration of others. Turned partially from them, and gazing straight into the fire, Harvey took in the whole situation. Stifling ,down the horrible, sickening pain at her h-art, Har- vey Berney's intellect summoned Gralhame to its judg- nment-seat, and there granting him fair trial, brought in X a righteous verdict of utter contempt. She did not know that of which the man was intensely conscious, that she, too, had never looked so handsome. The usually colorless lips and cheeks were glowing crimson, the eves werelike shining stars, and the firelight glint- ing over the raven hair gave it also a fitful gleam.   OPPORTUNITY.       '173 This state of affairs continued for perhaps half an hour, and might have done so much longer had it not been for Sophia. :Grahame's preoccupation with Hen- rietta not only occasioned some ill-humor in Mrs. Har- vey, but left her overflowing energies unemployed. ' The girl presented a tempting opportunity for the ex-, penditure of both, and upon her she began with nol definite object beyond the transfer of her own uncom- fortable feeling. "Harvey, we seem to have extinguished you ut- terly. Why don't you talk, child?" "Because I have nothing to say," was the cool reply. "Well, at least you can pay us the compliment of turning around and looking at us. Some of us are well worth the trouble, I assure you." "I can. see you all much more truly where I am. "What do you see? What do we look like?" un- A expectedly inquired Henrietta's voice. Grahame had turned entirely from her, and was lis- tening acutely to the girl's few words. At the sound of Miss Dangerfield's question, Harvey stirred visibly, and hesitated for a full minute. "I see," she said slowly, in a tone which, though low, had in it a strange intensity and distinctness, and seeming to describe with careful fidelity some picture which those marvellous eyes saw clear and vivid in the depths of the fire into which she was gazing, " a spot- i etz  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7732-00000087"/> 174        OPPORTUNITY. less plain of snow, with 'moonlight upon it, each ren- dering the other brighter, whiter, and colder." The te'mperature of the room suddenly seemed to have- fallen below zero, as Miss Dangerfield, who had been leaning forward as she spoke apnd listened, sat back with a sensation of having momentarily seen and recognized herself. There was absolute stillness for several minutes, when Grahame drew attention to himself by. a slight change of position, thereby, from an uncontrollable impulse, asking a question he had not courage to put into words. The girl comprehended, and responded almost instantaneously: -- "I see in the spring woodlands a pretty little stream dancing and chattering over pebbles and stones, gain- ing its beauty chiefly from its shallowneis." She -hes- itated for a second or two. "I'see the same woodland under the glowing summer sun; but the poor little stream has vanished before its power, and the stones lying bare, hard, and unsightly, give small evidence that it was once as the early morning and year." Had she stood up and personally charged him, -- "Veiled as your really meagre nature now is by youth and beauty, the test and trial of life will develop an incompetent manhood and a weak, degenerate old age," -had she spoken these words, Grahame Ferguson would have comprehended no more thoroughly her meaning, her prophecy of evil to come. He realized the truth of it in every fibre of his being. He forgot Henrietta, he forgot everything around him except "'         ?   OPPORTUNITY.        175 that strong, steady profile -on wlich the fire-light flamed up redly, as he sat there clothed as with a gar- ment with his sense of innate weakness and incapacity, filled with dread that he had at least fearfully imper- illed if not lost his only chance of deliverance from his natural and legitimate fate. "What else do you see?" asked Mrs. Harvey, no more willing to be overlooked on this than on any other occasion. "I see - nothing!" said the girl. The perfect vacuity of Sophia's character came home even to herself as she heard herself thus de- scribed in one word. As Harvey spoke it she rose, and with a little disdainful gesture of her hand, which any otineelse would have used in dismissing them from her presence rather than in withdrawing from theirs, walked out of the room. The rest sat in an uncom- fortable quietude for a little while, and then left the apartment one by one; leaving Dr. Dan still smoking, but in a silence which had become very thoughtful. "Margaret, where is Harvey?"he asked, when, somewhat later, he met his sister at the tea-tray. , Three persons besides the speaker listened eagerly for the answer. "I left her in my room, sitting by the fire; she said she did not care for any tea, and was too tired to come down." , The hours went by; but though Henrietta and Gra- hame waited with such varied feelings for her appear-  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7732-00000088"/> X176 '      OPPORTUNITY. ance, they waited in vain. As 'this was Grahame's first evening in the parlor, the attention he received and the excitement he produced may be imagined. But instead of flattering and soothing him, as such blandishments generally did, to-night they provoked and annoyed him as an uncomfortably large allowance of just what he did not want. Consequently the rest of the company were not so sorry as they would other- wise have been when Dr. Dan ordered him off to bed at ten o'clock. When Mrs. Berney came up stairs, she found her daughter sitting juist where she had left her. 'I Harvey, my dear, you had better come to bed," said the lady. "Yes, mamma," replied the girl, but neither did nor said anything further. When Mrs. Berney was ready for her couch, the same remark was made, and received the same an- swer; but this time the girl did rise and undress, but having done so resumed her place at the fire with the ostensible purpose of warming her feet. Supposing her daughter would not be many minutes in following her example, Mrs. Berney dozed off several times, and finally dropped into a sound sleep. She had scarcely done so, when there came the lightest possible tap at the door; and before the girl could answer, it opened, and Miss Dangerfield entered. Harvey rose instantly, and retreating lbehind her chair, stood with her hand upon the baclkof it in an attitude which was as curi-   OPPORTUNITY.        1" ously on the defensive as was the expression of the eyes and face. "6 Ah! I thought I should find you up. My fire does not burn well to-night, so I thought you would let me warm myself by yours before I went to bed," Henrietta slmoothly remarked as she approached. Disdaining to go through the farce of welcoming her, or of appearing to accept this flimsy covering of some real purpose, Harvey only looked steadily at her in the same watchful silence. Miss Dangerfield had probably made up her mind to some such reception; for-it did' not seem to disconcert her as she leaned against the mantel-piece, and, putting one of her slip- pered feet upon the fender, looked calmly down into the blaze. Thus they stood for perhaps five minutes, though it seemed thwice thatf time; Harvey waiting with the sensation of a duellist whose opponenthas won the- first shot.  "Miss Berney,": said Henrietta at last, speaking very slowly and very distinctly, ," your faculty of see- ing portraits in the fire seems to be contagious. Shall  I return your courtesy, and give you also the unusual chance of seeing yourself as others see you? Shall I show you the picture at which I am looking?" There was dead silence for a moment, and then Miss Dangerfield went on. "I see a brook which, gazing up at the moon, is re- ceiving its full reflection upon its breast; but the old song has in this case come true, for though the brook 8'             L  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7732-00000089"/> '178       OPPORTUNITY. sees but one moon,' the moon looks on many brooks.'"              e As she finished her sentence, the cold blue eyes left the fire, and were fixed upon the girl. With the same steady silence as before Harvey fronted her; one slight thing alone proved that she had heard, but, slight as it was, Henrietta never forgot it. As Miss Danger- field ceased, the hand which had been tightly grasping the back of the chair suddenly relaxed, and the arm dropped heavily to her side. In that second Harvey Berney loosed hey voluntary hold on life, her real care and clinging to existence died within her forever. If life were dependent upon volition, she would have simply passed out of it then and there. ,' Good night," said Henrietta, turning to go. Neither the white lips nor the shining eyes made the slightest movement in reply. The girl's chief con- sciousness was a loathing, shuddering fear that this beautiful woman would come and kiss her good night, as is the custom among girls; had Miss Dangerfield done so, Harvey always believed that she would have dropped dead upon the floor, But Henrietta was rad- ically neither a weak nor a mean woman, and so was never unnecessarily cruel. She had spiritually mur- tered the girl who stood before her, and she knew it, and intended it; but she had dealt the death-blow firmly and deftly, applying the rack neither before nor after. So, having accomplished her object, she went her way.   OPPORTUNITY.        179 When the door closed, Harvey quietly came round, her chair, and seated herself unconsciously in one of hler customary lazy attitudes; but there was a curious droop in the head and shoulders, which, while it re- tained the old form, was strangely new and unlike in effect. The moments seemed to fleet by this motion- less figure as a river swiftly flows past a rock, with equally little effect. With her white- dress, and still, colorless face,:but for the eyes ever steady, broad, and brilliant, you would have imagined her petrified or dead. Perhaps both suppositions had their own truth. She was simply accepting withl her whole nature Miss Dangerfield's representation of her true relation to Gra- hame Ferguson and his to her; a statement which her clear intellect had recognized and ratified on the in- stant. That which before had been blind feeling, pas- sion and instinct, suddenly'cleared and crystallized into perception and knowledge. Mere child as she was, she knew now what terrible- fate had befallen her. This mingled agony and bliss, this anger and adoration, then, was love, - the love of which she had dreamed and read. The case was horribly simple, - it was only that she loved this man, and that he did not love her. Tp her he was all, -more her life than her own life; to him she was merely a little incident, more or less ex- citing than hundreds of -such which his life had con-. tained, and which perhaps still held place in it. 'c The- moon looks on many brooks."  The ceaseless repeti- tion of this single line somewhere in the depths of her  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7732-00000090"/> 180        OPPORTUNITY. brain seemed to form to her surging thoughts and feelings a strange accompaniment whose rhythm she seemed compelled to follow with an equally ceaseless regularity and accuracy. That was all that need be said; it told the whole story. The night had half spent itself, and Mrs. Berney's first weariness had been slept off, when, partially awaking, she had a vague -impression that either the sun was rising or the house was on fire. Sitting up in bed, she found the unusual light to be only the wan- ing candle, and the smouldering logs upon the and- irons before which her daughter sat. "Why, Harvey I what time is it?" asked the con- fused lady, not certain whether she had slept five min- utes or five hours. "I don't know, mamma," the girl answered. There was a-smothered tone in her voice, which her mother mistook for sleepiness. "Do come to bed," Mrs. Berney went on. "Why do you sit over that handful of coals, when you must be both cold and tired?" Without reply, Harvey rose, extinguished the light, and obeyed her mother's request. As she always did before going to sleep, Mrs. Berney put out her hand to draw the covering around Harvey's usually rebellious shoulders. Now, to her dismayed astonish- ment, she found that -the girl had thrown it entirely off her fevered frame. "Harvey, Harvey, how can you do so?" her moth-   ,OPPORTUNITY.       181 er began, with that irritation which is so often the expression of a woman's anxiety. "Mamma, O let me alone, only let me alone!" the girl suddenly cried out; sharp, bitter pain quivering through the muffled tone. Mrs. Berney drew back, and lay deliberately down, but with such a sickening sensation at her heart as she had hoped and prayed might never torture it again. Her fear and anxiety had been for her child's body, now they were for her spirit. No woman who had lherself lived and loved could possibly have mistaken the meaning of the girl's accents. The mother knew instantly that the child who had slept so calmly at her side through all these long years was now a woman, that iri a few short hours she had entered irrevocably into her woman's heritage of suffering and-enduring. Then Mrs. Berney proved her right to that highest of all titles,--a good mother. Be- cause she had done this being the very doubtful ser- vice of bringing it into this so'rrowful world, she did not imagine that she possessed it for life, body and soul. She reverenced her child's individuality, dis- playing the angelic attribute of recognizing places where she ," feared to tread." She, comprehended the girl's nature enough to know that it was somewhat akin to that of the young knights of chivalry, who- must keep their vigils, must fight -their battles alone, with such fate and fortune as might come. Thus they lay through the still night, so near and yet so separate; 2  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7732-00000091"/> 82        OPPORTUNITY. learning by such different teachings the essential lone- liness of each human soul. Towards dawn Harvey's exhausted frame fell into restless, bWoken slumber; but the mother watched until the morning light showed her child's face, with its ashen lips and dark-encircled eyes. When Harvey awoke, it was with a dull, heavy sense of having been racked by physical illness. Then the truth rushed upon her, and she hid her face among the pillows, with a feeling as though she could never again lift it to the light. But the necessity for so doing gradually dawned upon her, and the unquench- able pride of her soul bade her do itwhravely. She knew it must be very late, for the place at her side was empty. She rose, and dressed as hastily as possi- ble. She had finished, and was smoothing h6r hair before the glass, speculating whether the habitual pal- lor of her face would not cover from observation its present haggard look and hue, when her mother en- tered. She. had been in the room several minutes, when Harvey said quietly,-  "Mamma, will you go home this afternoon?" "( Yes, my child." She could not refrain from offering the comfort con- tained in that epithet, though she strove to make her assent commonplace and to keep the quiver of sympa- thy out of her voice. Again Mrs. Berney proved her unselfish mother-love, in that she denied herself the relief of taking the girl in her aims and weeping over   OPPORTUNITY.       183 her, her fellow-sufferer.  There was nothing more said, and presently Harvey went down stairs. It was so late that the breakfast-room was nearly deserted, but she compelled herself to go through the form of eating and drinking. Having done so, she, as usual, made her way to the office. Dr. Dan was sitting there, apparently reading; but in reality thinking of her in connection with the scene which had passed upon that spot the night before, - thinking with newly acquired clear-sightedness, aris- ing from his freshy awakened fears. He looked quickly up as she entered, and the face he saw gave an answer to. his thoughts -which he had fiercely striven to deny them. There was that in' it which, in an instant, brought back to him all the bedsides by which he had ever stood, and seen men or women die hard. The girl came, as she so ofen did, and leaned upon the high back of his chair; but he did not, as usual, put out his hand, and draw her towards him; he literally did not dare to. "Uncle," she said, " mamma and I are going home this afternoon." The amazed protest which rfshed to his lips was checked so instantaneously by- his afterthought, that it died in an inarticulate sound. Then he put up Iris hand over his face, and sat thus for perhaps five minutes.  Little woman," he said at last, speaking rather * "           &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7732-00000092"/> 184        dPPORTUNITY. huskily, "if last night, when the fire showed you so much, it had shown you me,' I am afraid you would have seen the tree upon which there was nothing but leaves. But the leaves can at least shade, little wo- man ; they can shade and shelter." It was some minutes more before the hard, tight pain which bound each throat like a cord relaxed suffi- ciently to render further speech practicable. Beyond a curious change in the sound of her breathing, she had made' no- response to his words; because, as the man well knew, none was possible, and none was needed. Presently she said:- "You will see that the carriage is at the door in time to take us to the cars; and, Uncle, - you need not speak of it beforehand, please." "Yes," he answered quietly, and Harvey walked quickly out of the room. Dr. Dan's first emotion on awaking to the situation had been one of intense wrath against Grahame. But he knew this phase of life too thoroughly for this mood to continue very long. He remembered towards how many women he himself had acted in the same man- / ner, had almost unintentionally produced the same re- X suit; and whatever might be the degree of Grahame's culpability, he acknowledged in his heart that his was not the hand to cast the first stone at him. He recol- lected also what an innocent little pastime it had seemedl to him when he had been the chief actor in the. play; how guiltless he had been of any design beyond   OPPORTUNITY.       185 a pursuit of his own entertainment at the moment; how he had only followed what seemed a necessity of his nature; and, with a somewhat rare magnanimity, he gave Grahame the benefit of the arguments which had then justified him in his own sight, but which now failed to do so. The punishment for his youthful sins seemed to;have fallen, as it so often does, riot upon him, but upon that which he held dearest; thereby smiting him as no direct blow could have done. Look- ing back over the past month, if he blamed any one for what seemed chiefly an unfortunate combination of temperaments and circumstances, it was himself, - for not having seen more clearly, for not having guarded against a danger of whose existence his own experience might surely have warned him. In the light of all this, his anger faded rapidly away; and it was yearning, helpless sorrow over his darling child with which Dr. Dan's heart ached and bled that day. The excitement and fatigue of the previous evening had so nearly exhausted Grahame's small stock of strength, that, from inclination and the doctor's orders, He had intended to remain in his room until evening. Consequently, when Dr. Dan announced at the dinner-table that he was about to lose his sister and her daughter, Harvey had not his presence and the effect of the news upon him to try her beyond her strength. But she had Miss Dangerfield's observa- tion to undergo, and that was quite enough. - It was but a single look, a momentary hard brightness in the  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7732-00000093"/> 186        OPPORTUNITY. cool blue eyes; but it was the illumination for a vic- tory. When we are the -losing party, we can read the Jubilate of our enemies in very small signs; and Harvey well understood that recognition of her terri- ble defeat. It only intensified her one absorbing desire,-,to get away from this house and all its in- mates. After dinner, one of the young men had taken him- self and his cigar to Grahame's apartment, to enjoy with him a post prandial smoke and talk. Grahame was lounging about the room in his dressing-wrapper, and the conversation was as lazy and careless as him- self. Presently the sound of wheels drew him and his wandering attention to the window. "Who is leaving this afternoon?" he asked care- lessly, knowing, from the hour and the conveyance which was drawn up before the door, that the railway station was the probable destination. "Mrs. Berney and that disagreeable daughter of hers," the young man answered, with gratified anima- tion. In another moment Grahame had torn off his dress- ing-wrapper, and, snatching up his coat, was making desperate efforts to get into it. But, though the sleeve had been opened to accommodate his swollen, ban- daged atm, he found it no easy task to put it on. "Take hold of this and help me, can't you?" he exclaimed, with intense impatience; and the young man did as he was told. o.'4                 '  '   OPPORTUNITY.        187 Then Grahame dashed out of the room, and was down stairs before the other realized what he intended to do. Mrs. Berney and Harvey stood upon the porch, just ready to enter the carriage; and Dr. Dan and Sophia were seeing them off. Harvey was far- thest from him; but he passed them- all without look or word, and came directly to her side. "You are not going?" he gained breath to say;, and the sentence was a command, protest, and en- treaty, all in one. His face was as pale, as Harvey's own;; and his eyes had a startled light in them, as though some great fear and danger had suddenly come upon him. The girl was standing sidewise. She-did not in any way alter her position, and gave her affirmative an- swer merely by a movement of her head. As he saw it, Grahame made a strange gesture with his hand.  It was that of a man clinging to his gear- dian angel who was leaving him; it was that of a man striving to grasp the' heaven which had fleeted from his hold. As Harvey saw it, she turned completely round and faced him . Hitherto she had regarded herself as the losing party, had thought of this going as tile necessary retreat after a sore defeat; but in that mo- ment a revulsion of feeling had come over her which made her look at it in a different light. "Good by," she said; and from the eyes and voice all passion and anger had passed, leaving them with a  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7732-00000094"/> 188        OPPORTUNITY. calmness and sadness almost like dt0i. It was a strong, high soul, however suffering, journeying for- ever upward and onward, now bidding farewell to an other soul, narrow, weak, and incapable, which it must leave behind, and which must tend downward, downward to the end. Each must walk its own way, each fulfil its own course; and, though their ways and their courses seemed now but slightly to diverge, she knew that each step must take them farther apart, that their ends must eternally differ. This was the truth which had come to Harve'y Berney in that mo- ment; this was the truth she had conveyed to him in that single word; and, speaking no other, she left him. , Then Grahame turned-towards the house, and went back to his room. That' night, when Dr. Dan was asked why Mr. Fer- guson did not come down, he answered that the fever he had all along feared had now come on, and that Grahame was very ill.  Such was, indeed, the case; and it was several weeks before he again left his room. When he was able to do so, he returned to town almost immedi-  ately.    -OPPORTUNITY.       189, CHAPTER XIV. THE instinct of flight which had urged Harvey so imperatively to leave the house which held Gra- hame Ferguson still actuated'her as intensely when she was once more settled at home. It simply took a fresh form ancdobject. Then her aim had been to get away from him, now it was to get away from herself. She felt as thoughl memory were some pursuing, de- vouring wild beast, whose hot breath was always up- In her cheek, just beyond whose clutches her utmost ifforts barely permitted her to keep. She gave her- elf no rest. Morning, noon, and night she worked,' r, as it always seemed to her, fled ceaselessly. Study- lg, reading, sewing, walking, practising, - anything, nything but thinking. "Forgetting the things which re behind, I press forward."  At times that seemed ie only text in the Bible which she   understood, It understood it, alas! as much from  her failure her efforts to attain it.- By daylight or candle- ght, whenever she could feed the ravenous craving r occupation which the instinct of self-preservation td taught her, continued life seemed possible. Mere istence from one moment to another was so dif-, ult a matter that it demanded her whole nature; e Present was so imperious that it temporarily comrn- a           . *  '  *  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7732-00000095"/> 190        OPPORTUNITY. pelled the Past to stand aside. But those twilights, those dreadful twilights, when she sat silent and idle with her mother, when the Past seemed to seize upon her, and rule ruthlessly over soul and body; when every minutest memory came back to her with a fidelity, with a glorified vividness, which was ex- quisite torture as it contrasted with the dark des- olation of the Present, -these were beyond human endurance.  Mrs. Berney was sometimes startled by the almost desperate way in which Harvey would suddenly spring up and ring for lights, as though she could no longer bear the empty gloom which was upon Nature and her own spuL Then back to work, to that incessant striv- ing for a forgetfulness which was never attained, to that hopeless endeavor to numb the dull, gnawing pain in her breast which never for an instant ceased. Thus Harvey Berney's desolated days went on, thus passed that initiation period of pain which must come to every soul which is to reach any higher stage of life. When Grahame Ferguson returned to Baltimore, he was thoroughly ill at ease with himself and all the world. He had received a severe shock both mentally and physically, and he felt the effects of it. The two weeks of fever which he had spent at Bon- brook after Harvey's departure had been passed in a spiritual suffering which was too real and intense not to possess a certain dignity. He comprehended her   OPPORTUNITY.       191 renunciation of him, understood also how final and entire it was, at the very time when he first fully realized how absolutely necessary she had become to the continued existence of his better self. Little as he had ever contemplated marrying for years to come, during those days he would have gladly sac- rificed anything and everything to have thus secured the girl who had cast him off. But a certain degree of original strength of character is necessary to the continuance of any emotion; and of this Grahame had never possessed much, and had long since fritterd away that which he had.  Consequently, when he came back to his city home and associations,.llis feel-r ings began to be colored, as they always were, by his surroundings. At BoiAbrook his higher nature had been evoked, and had seemed to him his whole being; in the city, a lower self was called out, and answered the demand with equal completeness. Seeing nothing of Harvey, the entire hold she had taken upon him be- gan to slacken. She being still a school-girl, he had no opportunities of meeting her casually in general soci- ety; and, with the recollection of that parting on the steps at Bonbrook constantly returning to him, he vainly strove for sufficient resolution to pay her a  direct visit. The longer he delayed, the less courage he found he possessed; and, indeed, the less inclination. In that quiet country home he had looked at Harvey with his own eyes, and recognized her as the truest, strongest, highest human soul With which he had ever *  *    **  -  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7732-00000096"/> 192        OPPORTUNITY come in contact, one which had power to bear him with it in its journey heavenward. Now he could not help using the optics of those around him, and perceiving that she was an ugly child, without wealth or social influence, grace or apparent talent; with noth- ing which he could offer as a plea for his infatuation. Like all weak men, he valued, even dreaded, the opinion, not of the world, - for that is the case with the ambitious of every degree, --but of that small clique which he lived in and called the world. He had always intended that, when he married, the men with whom he associated should be as admiringly im- pressed-with his success in this as in other social mat- ters. He had no fancy for the way in which he knew they would open their eyes, and patronizingly shrug their shoulders, behind his back, were an engagement between himself and Harvey Berney announced. Besides the objections applicable particularly to her, all the reasons which had hitherto influenced him against matrimony now presented themselves more definitely than ever. As he looked around at his lux- urious apartments, the fact vividly forced itself upon his mind that his income was scarcely large enough to support more than one person in the sybaritic style which had become to him second nature.. His prop- erty would require personal thought and management if he burdened it more heavily;$ and the change seemed by no means a pleasant one, as, contrasted with his usual lazy indifference to matters of dollars and   OPPORTUNITY.        193 cents. Then he would go into society, where he had a score of flirtations of more or less warmth to take up as it pleased him, - where beautiful women rendered up to him that mixture of flattery and folly which had become to him as necessary a stimulant as wine to some men; and, again, he would be keenly sensible that here was something which must be sacrificed, at least in a great degree, if he made a change in his position. Greatly -as he wished for Harvey when he was alone, --and there were times when his desire for her, and with her all better, higher things came back upon him with more than its original intensity,- when he was in the world, and imbibed its spirit, the price seemed heavy. Added to this, he in no degree realized that she  already loved him with the power and truth of her whole nature. He firmly believed that she was far more to him than he to her; in fact, this was to him the most astonishing part of the affair. He had all his life been giving almost nothing, and getting almost X everything in return; here he had bestowed nearly everything, and apparently had received next to noth- ing. Experience had really left him little room to doubt his ability to make any- woman love him in time; and, except in his temporary fits of depression, he scarcely doubted that he might ultimately succeed with her, were he to maintain steadily the effort he had made at Bonbrook. That he had already suc- 9              M  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7732-00000097"/> 194        OPPORTUNITY. ceeded he did not know, and he had small cause to know. He had seen her but once since they had parted in the country, and that was on the street, where they had met face to face, leaving her no chance to avoid him, as she had done many times before. He had forced her to stop and shake hands, and exchange a few sentences; but the cold, indiffer- ent way in which she had done it had made him pass on with a sickened, confused sense of humiliation, an angry resentment at her for causing it, and at himself for caring for it, that sent him home to shut himself up for two or three days, until he had smoked off the edge of his disappointment; after which he healed his wounded vanity by a violent flirtation with the belle of the season. But there were other divisions of his nature to which this salve scarcely extended. How- ever, looking at things from his present stand-point, he came simply to his old conclusion to let time and circumstances drift him where they would; blind to the truth that, in this case, they were drifting him downward, - that he was now making his final, fatal choice between God and Mammon. When Dr. Dan came up to town in the spring, the' change in Harvey struck him instantly. Even more than during those last days at Bonbrook was he im- pressed with the fact that she was no longer a child. The perfectly quiet but resolute way in which she ig- nored the past, and compelled him to do the same ; the steady power with which she controlled the conversa-   OPPORTUNITY.       195 tion, keeping it entirely upop intellectual and neutral subjects, amazed him. Only once, just as he was leaving, her self-control gave way. He had been lis- tening to her for some time, - a sad, wistful meaning growing in his eyes. "Ah, my pet! I am afraid you are ceasing to be my little child. I am afraid you will so n be a woman."  "I am a woman!" she cried out, with sudden, wild passion, as though that single sentence was the most perfect statement of all her sorrow and agony and loss. Dr. Dan shrank back, shocked at the result of his words, and went away sorrowing.  Still time went on and performed its inevitable work. The next four years, which Grahame Fer- guson spent in walking the old social treadmill, Har- vey used very differently, with a very different result. Of course, long before their completion, she had taken her place as a full-grown member of society. But her mother's quiet life, and hler own utter inability to en- dure constant contact with uncongenial persons, still kept her existence a very retired one. Finding the characters with which books and her imagination were peopled infinitely more to her taste than any she met in the body, she chiefly kept to them; seldom going into company, except for some special reason. Still, she was known and admired even enthusiastically. Men who knew her intimately almost invariably grew ,  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7732-00000098"/> 196,       OPPORTUNITY. to belong to her; and, though some of them broke their hearts with hopeless love and longing, they all remained eager for and honored by the friend- ship of the woman who would give them nothing more. For so it was. Her eyes had brightened for many, but they had softened for none since Grahame Ferguson had looked into their depths. He now necessarily met her occasionally in society, and upon a very different footing from that of the "Iittle savage" at Bonbrook. She was incontest- ably a very striking and elegant looking woman. The length of her rich black hair was equal to its thickness; the constitutional pallor was so clear as to be a unique beauty; the figure had so toned down from its look of immature overgrowth that it seemed much taller than of old, while it retained its, careless ease in the form of freedom and grace. The eyes remained the same, only increasing in brilliancy and infinite variety of expression. Her manner had un- dergone an equal change.   Although the nervous pride would come into it at times, unexpectedly even to herself, still she was generally good-humored and courteous. She had learned to disregard strangers, and had rightfully won the reputation of a remarkable conversationist. ^ When she and Grahame were thrown together by circumstances, as far as she could slme avoided him. The intensity of her feeling had, of course, died out; but though Time had apparently killed her love, it r,   OPPORTUNITY.       197 still retained sufficient vitality to make talking to him very nervous work.   The ceaseless gnawing pain at her heart had passed away; leaving in its place a deadened sensation, to which she was so ac- customed as scarcely to regard it. She had come to the conclusion that to her an emotional existence was impossible; and therefore an increased intellectual life was all that remained. The vitality and motive-power which is generally divided between heart and brain she had concentrated upon the latter ; and the effect was every day more evident. Still, the ghost of the dead days would sometimes rise very potent, and it was occasionally a- sore -earvt and white face which would be laid upon Harvey's couch after one of these encounters. From them (especially if he had heard her talk, and some of the old delicious excitement had stirred him) Grahame would go home to a night of sleeplessness and a reactionary week of blank weari- ness. After which, so many persons were sure to tell him how badly he looked, that he was forced in self- defence to seek some other counteracting excitement, seldom, though, of a very high order. Long before these years had passed, Harvey had realized the truth of Dr. Dan's prophecy concerning her woman's need of religion. Walking through " the' weary land," she had sought and found " the shadow of a great rock."  Thus this influence added its rip- ening force to a nature which was to spring so soon into blossom and bloom.\ She was now twenty, and  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7732-00000099"/> 198        OPrOBRTUNITY. stood gazing around her at life, with a vague wonder for what purpose she had been put into it, and yet with a strange, expectant sense of waiting for some moment or event which would interpret it all. Sud- denly, like a revelation, the perception of that for which she was fitted, and for which all things had been preparing her, came upon her. "The angel- said unto me Write, and I wrote." It was with no irreverence that Harvey, then and ever after, quoted: John's words as the only explanation she could give to herself or others of her course in life. Without the slightest drill or experience in such matters, this girl sat deliberately down to write a book; and that, too, with even less doubt of her ability, or fear for its success when written. "I will be Goethean at least in one respect. I will write the story which ' lies next me,'" she thought and said. "The truth will take care of itself; my only care is to speak it faithfully," she would calmly answer the few who, knowing of her work, faintly warned and remonstrated. So day by day she worked on with that patient, steady power which is the best evidence of genius; which is the essential difference between' the true fire and the miere spark or phosphoric glimmer. -That a- woman's novel is powerful just in so much as it is autobiographic, Harvey knew by instinct. Conse- quently she let memory linger and wander as for long years she had not dared to do; she laid her hand   OPPORTUNITY.        199 upon her own pulse and heart, and registered their throbs and beats with that unflinching courage and accuracy wtlich guarantee their own success. The result was necessarily a book over which men won- dered with an admiration mingled with some alarm and protest -as to its truth, but over which women flushed and sobbed as they read and recognized its absolute verity. Had Harvey's faitli in her book been founded upon anything less incontrovertible than fact, she must have become discouraged while writing it. Her mother watched its progress and publication with fear for the heavy disappointment she believed it would bring to her dear child. Dr. Dan tried to smile and look hopeful when she told him of it, but failed signally, and begged her not to set her heart upon its success. He had known too many clever girls and brilliant, witty women, not to be very dubious as to their power to produce anything of real value. He had listened to many fine talkers, sayers of indisputably good things; but he was famil- iar with the marvellous manner in which this wit,  wisdom, and originality generally sinks into level dul- ness when it is attempted to transfer it to paper. He was strongly of the opinion that most persons' pens are what Emerson calls " non-conductors." Conse- quently he gave little aid and comfort to her work; rather taking credit to himself that he did not try to induce her to abandon it, that he bore with it gently as a youthful folly which would pass away with riper years and sense. i   ofr  '   &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7732-00000100"/> 200        OPPORTUNITY. One person alone believed in her. "What are you doing now?" asked Grahame Fer- guson &amp;ne night, as he stood by her at a crowded party. It was a question he invariably put at their occa- sional meetings; he, like Harvey herself, always re- garding her future with a sense of expectancy, having a conviction that her accomplishment of something re- markable was simply a matter of time and rate of de- velopment. "I am writing a novel," she answered quietly. The man flushed, and started almost as though he had been struck. "I knew you would come to it I I knew you would come to it!" he broke out enthusiastically, in generous- triumph and honest pleasure. "Only I did not think it would be so soon." :The girl looked up into his face. For the first time since she had knelt at his side at Bonbrook her eyes met his with softening light, with tender emotion shin- ing in them. Without a word she put out her hand. With all his weakness and failures, this man alone had understood her; and she mutely gave him thanks and acknowledgment. For months after, Grahame could not think of this mo- ment without the same flush and thrill returning which throbbed through him as he felt her touch and look. Harvey never forgot it. Often and often in the coming years, when others bore hardly upon him, and intel- lect and truth compelled her to admit the justice of   OPPORTUNITY.        201 their verdict, she would always put in this plea as his claim upon her, at least to try to take him at his best. "Do you remember," she would say, alluding to perhaps the most touching trait recorded of any hero, --" do you remember that when Mahomet's first wife, Fatima, was old and ugly, he still clung to her beyond all the beauties of his harem, 'because,' he said, 'at first, when all others doubted me, she alone believed'? Grahame Ferguson has the same claim upon me." This book was the monument she raised over her dead love; and nothing could-have proved more con- clusively how extinct was its life than her capacity to write it. We can perform operations upon living sub- jects, but it is only corpses we can calmly dissect. When we can guide the knife with skill, coolness, and even interest, we may be sure there is little left for the subject but decent burial. More and more Harvey realized this as she patiently went on with her chroni- cle; more -and more she believed that she was dealing with an irrevocable past, that at sixteen she had stood bankrupt of all that makes life perennially fresh and beautiful. 'But the apparently dead heart seemed to have bequeathed its force to the living brain, and that brain wrought, in consequence, with abnormal power. At last the result came. Her book appeared with a success which surpassed her highest expectations. At twenty-three she stood before the world with fame and honor won by her own right hand; and Harvey drew a long breath,-feeling that she had finished her 9*  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7732-00000101"/> 202.       OPPORTUNITY. work, and now was ready to die. She had yet to learn how little our times are in our own -hands. It was with a very curious sensation that Gra- hame Ferguson sat down in the quiet solitude of his- room, and opened this book for the first time. On, on he read, -until the day passed into the night and the night approached the morning. Thousands of others had been swept away by its intellectual force and intensity; -but its power over him was derived from a very different source. He was reading the record of his own heart and life; he was looking at his own nature laid bare before his eyes. Gradually the design of the book dawned upon him; and he knew that this was the noble revenge she had taken for the selfish wrong by which he had wrecked her young life. For she had painted not the man he was, but the man he might have been. The infinite depth of humiliation into which that contrast seemed to sink him; the sorrow, worse than for the dead, over that lost self; the vivid perception of a higher, better life, and4 his still more vivid apprehension of his innate weakness and incapacity even to attempt now to live it,--all these combined to form a refined torture, which might weigh in the balance against almost any sin. Yet how surely the lower nature of the man spoke out I how strongly that vanity which was the key-note of his character sounded through every feeling! To observe how perfect -was her memory, of the past ; to   OPPORTUNITY.        203 see how his very words and looks had been tran- scribed; to find that slight peculiarities of tone and manner, which he had never dreamed she had noticed, had all been recorded with delicate care, with faithful patience, was flattery so original, so transcendent, that it fairly intoxicated him! And to think that, had he been true to himself, to God, and to her, he might have reached this ideal she had lavished her genius to draw,- far beyond that, she might have loved him as this heroine loved this hero! There are few men who can have the Is and the Might-have-been of their lives clearly held up to their sight, without ever after bearing traces of the shadow of the vision.  When Grahame Ferguson closed that book, he seemed to have suddenly added ten years to his age. Had he met her while the first effect of it was upon him, he probably would have poured out some wild confession of utter humiliation before her, some acknowledgment of the righteousness of its verdict. But they did not meet. Now, as ever, he was too weak-natured, too lacking in stamina, both mental and physical,- to go directly to her, to shape his destiny by his own will; and the small miracle he was always, expecting Providence or chance to work to bring about his desires was not in this case performed. So, though he could never lose the influence of what that night had shown -him in himself and others, though he could never again be the same man, as  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7732-00000102"/> - 204   ?PPORTUNITY. the months went by he reacted somewhat into his old stagnation, still more into his old habits. But there was one person nearly connected with her life and story whom she did encounter. ,When Harvey entered society, she found Henrietta Dangerfield as beautiful and admired as when she had first known her, and indeed such was still almost the case. At their first meeting, there had been some slight cool greeting on the elder lady's part, returned in exact kind and degree by the younger; and this had since been their accustomed formula; this, and a curious, covert watchfulness of which each was equal- ly conscious in the other. Until about a month after the appearance of Har- vey's book, nothing had ever jarred the ice between them. But arriving quite late one night at a party, Harvey entered the dressing-room, and found its only occupant to be Miss Dangerfield, standing before the glass, giving little artistic touches to her costume with wonderful effect. Harvey bowed slightly, put off her wrappings, and came also to the large mirror to rear- range her draperies. Looking into the glass, Hen- rietta saw, not only her own radiant figure at full length, but Harvey's face reflected over her shoulder; that face paying its old, almost unconscious, homage to her marvellous beauty. Perhaps it was the familiar look, reproducing the long-ago, which decided Hen- rietta to follow her strong impulse ; perhaps its subtile stimulation of her vanity carried her out of herself;   OPPORTUNITY.        205 perhaps its honest tribute from her ancient enemy stirred the Henrietta Dangerfield of her youth into life, to render honest tribute in return. At any rate, she suddenly turned and faced her. Harvey Berney, you have made me envy you from my heart."    , Now, as always, the two women held each other with their steady eyes; but there was a flame in Hen- rietta's blue orbs which told that the influence of the first time Harvey had raised her envy was quite as present as the second. The effect life had wrought in each was very distinct at that moment in their faces: one had learned to suffer and be strong; the other, to suffer and be hard. It was after a moment's pause that Harvey said, smiling rather sadly,-- "There is very little to envy, Miss Dangerfield. You forget the great law of compensation, or rather of balance." "You told our story very justly to some of us. You painted none of us blacker than we are. And yet I suppose you still hate me for what I once said to you," Henrietta exclaimed abruptly, passing Harvey's an- swer entirely by. This was one of the things she was determined to know before they parted. "I never hated you," Harvey slowly answered. "You merely showed me the truth. If you had first created it, perhaps I should have held you accountable for it."' "Remember, Henrietta Dangerfield, if failure and * as            o  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7732-00000103"/> 206        OPPORTUNITy. defeat were mine, so also were they yours, and in the same fight," was the real meaning of Harvey's last sentence; and Henrietta understood as perfectly as though the words had been spoken. A dull-red color had come into Harvey's face., This was the first time she had ever tried to put any refer- ence to her past life into audible sentences; and- no wonder that they were labored and difficult to speak. "But you hate him just as I do," Henrietta broke out with a smothered, vehemence,/ admitting their com- mon lot, and claiming in consequence a unity of feel- ing. '"No," returned the other, drawing her breath sjowly, it seemed even painfully, as she spoke; " there again you are wrong. I do not hate him, but there are times when I do worse." "' What is that?" cried Henrietta. "Despise him," said the other, quietly. "Harvey Berney, you are happier than I, for your love is dead I " burst from Henrietta's lips with sudden conviction. "Yes," replied the other, gravely, and moved away as though to leave. But the next second she turned back. "' Henrietta," she said, calling her unconsciously by her- Christian name, and speaking for the first time freely and naturally, "Grahame Ferguson's vanity is like the picture of the Madonna in the Catholic churches, before which a lamp must always be kept   OPPORTUNITY.        207 trimmed and burning. You and I have been among the foolish virgins who have furnished oil for this lamp; and if, in consequence, the light of our lives has waned, we must bear the result as best we may." Then she passed through the door; and Grahame Ferguson's name was never again mentioned between those two women.  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7732-00000104"/> 208        OPPORTUNITY.  CHAPTER XV. THE following summer being an extremely oppres- sive one, the exodus of the inhabitants of the heated city was even more general than usual. As is often the case, nearly all the Baltimoreans seemed to congregate at one watering-place. This year Cape May was so crowded with them that you could scarcely realize that you were not still under the shadow  of the Washington Monument. Of course, ofsuch a company Grahamre Ferguson was too im- portant a part to be allowed to remain at home, had he wished it. So there he was, at his old pursuit of trying to get rid of himself, and failing signally. Another face you would have recognized. Rose Carvel had come  to the seashore, as a necessary ap- pendage to her aunt, Mrs. Olmstead, much more will- ingly than she often followed that lady's movements. She was now twenty-four; one year Harvey Berney's senior, but looking  five years her junior. Time scarcely seemed to have any, effect upon her. Except for the difference in her size, it was just the " little Rosy "  of old, -- the same composed little figure; the same delicate, pale face, only accentuated into individ- uality by the outline of the brow and head, and a clear, pure light in the eyes, like moonlight. The past six t   OPPORTUNITY.       209 years had been one passive struggle,- on her aunt's part, to form her into a regular society woman; and, on her own, to be and remain herself. Outwardly the victory had been with Mrs. Olmstead. In every social engagement or observance Rose was kept fully up to thd mark; and her life, in consequence, was a very gay if not a very happy one. One circumstance assisted Mrs. Olmstead not a lit- tle. Rose's estate originally had been large, and care- ful nursing during her minority, had so increased it that she now possessed a very unusual fortune, - a fact which her aunt took care should be well known. Consequently, besides the few who really appreciated her, there always thronged around her that set of young meri, to be found in every society, who have the station, appearance, and manners of gentlemen, with- out the instincts,-- who, like the unjust steward spoken of in the Bible, "cannot dig," while' " to beg- they are ashamed," and so seek to gain by a rich marriage the wealth they have neither the brain nor industry to acquire by honest means, nor the courage to dispense with. Thus, in spite of herself, and in a very quiet way, Rose Carvel was quite an important personage. But, though her conformity to the world in the person of her aunt appeared absolute, she had managed to main- tain her individuality intact. Nothing provoked -Mrs. Olmstead more than the way in which Rose constantly followed what she called "her advice," leaving her  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7732-00000105"/> 210        OPPORTUNITY. equally unsatisfied and unable to state her complaint. The subtile manner in which the spirit} and the letter of the law were divorced kept that lady in a chronic state of discomfiture and amazement. But in this coming to the seaside their wishes had run parallel; and both were in unusual health and spirits. Living in the same set and city, Grahame and Rose had of course met incessantly, but they had never coalesced beyond good-humored courtesy; and now, though once again under the same roof, their intercourse was little closer than when, years before, they had been similarly situated. A fortnight had passed since Grahame had arrived at the hotel. The first week had been really pleas- ant. The sea-air and salt-water had invigorated him; he had met some new acquaintances and a fresh com- bination of old ones; had started a brisk flirtation with the most admired beauty; had been tacitly flattered to his heart's content; and, upon the whole, had really enjoyed himself. But the second week had not fairly begun, before the old, inevitable ennui claimed him. The bathing had lost its variety, he had discovered that the belle's bright eyes lacked brain behind them, had found nothing original, either among old or new friends, wherewith to stimulate his worn-out mental appetite. This state had increased day by day, until it had really become unbearable; and he had made up his mind to get away from place and people, as he could   'e S-OPPORTUNITY.          2" not fly from himself. He was sitting smoking on the hotel piazza, with his chair tilted back, and his hat half slouched over his eyes, uncertain which he was more disgusted with, - himself or those around him. , I 'll go home and see Di," he was thinking, with his instinctive -turning towards his brother's strength whenever his own completely failed; "anything to get rid of this sandy glare and the sound of those ever- lasting breakers. I should like to lie under the Oak again. The birds and the bees are better company than these chattering fools," was his complimentary reflection. In these days Cape May was only approachable by water'; and the stages, which conveyed the passengerls from the distant landing to the hlotels, arrived at them rather early in the afternoon. They were then driving up to the porch, and the boarders were flock- ing out to watch and comment upon the new arrivals. Grahame was in too bad a humor, too spoilt-child a mood, to honor them with the slightest change in his position, even to look tup. He had a sense of injury, as though each person increased just so much the avoirdupois weight of his boredom. However, as carriage after carriage was emptied and drove away, the instinct of curiosity began to rise, and he glanced up at the remaining vehicle. In another moment his chair came down with almost startling vehemence, his cigar was thrown away, his hat pushed up; and he stood with a man's  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7732-00000106"/> 212        OPPORTUNITY. eagerness in his eyes, a man's courage beating at his heart, and a man's earnestness thrilling his whole frame. Through that carriage window he had seen Harvey Berney's handsome head lifted with just the old, care- less, unconscious pride. The strong, steady profile had been turned towards him at the first moment, but now she had seen him, and was looking her recogni- tion; the mouth was softening with smiles, the splen- did eyes were shedding their light over the whole face, the gracious hand was upon the door, waiting for him to clasp it. Glare? why, this was only good, whole- some sunshine, which warmed a man's blood, and sent it glowing through his veins! Sandy had he called it? why, that beach was the most glorious of drives and walks, and the nights were moonlight now! And that monotonous roll of the waves which had so irri- tated his nerves, -Harvey loved the sound of the sea; she had told him so years ago at Bonbrook. It was all delightful, they could have met at no more charming place; he had always thought Cape May the most pleasant of watering-places, as of course Harvey must also, or she would not have come. All this went through his mind, as one conglomerated thought, in the single moment it took to step to the carriage door. They put out their hands simultaneously, and for a moment he held hers close and warm, with the answer- ing light in his eyes shining upon her. Then he   OPPORTUNITY.  ,     213 turned to Mrs. Berney, and assisted her to alight, while he gayly welcomed her to the island. That lady had glanced nervously at her daughter, as she saw who was coming; but instead of the old defensive look she had expected, Harvey's face showed such clear, bright pleasure that her mother was only, too glad to accept the situation, Mrs. Berney was so truly a gentlewoman herself, that she could never re- sist the influence of thoroughly fine manners in any one -else; so Grahame had always been personally agreeable to her in those Bonbrook days, and she had scarcely reached the ground before a little of the old, kindly sentiment returned. Harvey watched the slight action with the same acknowledgment of its perfection  which had been wrung from her so reluctantly in other days, but which she now gave freely and fully. Then she took his hand, and sprang lightly from the car- riage. He noticed that the wind on the bayl had blown back the hair from her face, and roughened its jetty surface; that her dress, and the long, summer mantle she drew carelessly round her, had both been crushed in the crowded boat and coach. As this is the case with all who arrive after that hot, tiresome journey, it had been one of Grahame's subtile sybaritisms to avoid seeing his lady friends until they descended in fresh evening costume. "I have to take people at their very best, my dear fellow," he had said only the day before, in explana-  ,9  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7732-00000107"/> 214        PPORUNITYrr tion of his leaving the fiont of the house at this hour, "for I find them poor enough then." But now that he observed the same things in Har- vev, they afforded him a poignant sensetof amusement chiefly from her calm disregard of disadvantages of which she was perfectly aware. Added to this was the thrill through his deeper nature with which he always recognized the evidence of the radical differ- ence between her influence over him and that of all other women. "Mamma and I have come here to get strength, and see people," said Harvey, as they waited in the anteroom  for their apartments to be assigned them; she supporting the conversation, for Grahame unex- pectedly found, as he stood there, that he had nothing to say, that somehow his thoughts would not fit them, selves into short, easy sentences. "See people," he mentally repeated, as he looked somewhat quickly at her.  His opinions of persons had undergone the same revulsion as his opinion -of the place during the moment of his recognition of Harvey; but, as he heard her manifest an interest in their existence, the s" chattering-fools " mood decided- ly returned. However, while she looked up at him - with that unwonted smile upon lips and   eyes, he thought he could afford them this small advantage. So, when at last their rooms were ready, he returned to the porch in such a delightful frame of mind that lie quite turned the heads of some half a- dozen young ladies there assembled. J               /   OPPORTUNITY.        215 He soon found out, through the newly arrived gen- tlemen, that though Harvey and her mother had trav- elled with a large party of acquaintances, they had no special escort. He instantly elected himself to the vacant office; and when they came down to tea, they found him waiting to attend them to their table, at which he had secured a place. - As they walked up the room, Grahame was struck, for perhaps the hundredth time, with the artistic .per- ception Harvey had learned to display in her own dress, as well as that of others. It was only the sim-- plest of white dresses, with but a trifle of soft lace as its colorless ornament; yet how singularly it accent- uated the contrast between her clear, tintless com- plexion and-heavy, raven hair! As they sat awaiting the arrival of the servant with their suppers, Harvey occupied her time with a delib- erate survey of the persons within her range of vision; rather enjoying this opportunity for that study of faces which had always had a fascination for her. Grahame watched her with amused expectation in the depths of his eyes, and hovering round the corners of his mouth. ,He was familiar with the almost preternatural acute- ness with which she read the internal by the external; and supposed each moment that he should hear some of their neighbors summed up in a single sentence as completely as though she had been cognizant of their histories. But though the ludicrous incongruities usu- ally found in American hotel life were never more ap,  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7732-00000108"/> 216        OPPORTUNITY. parent, Harvey passed them over with only careless, tolerant recognition written -in her face. Suddenly Grahame saw the eyes he was watching change, thbir vague curiosity concentrate into real interest. He naturally followed their direction. "Who is it?"Harvey asked rather abruptly, as she found they were gazing at the same person. "Such a curious face, - such a very curious face!" she added, half under her breath. "It is my cousin, Rose Carvel," Grahame quietly answered. Miss Berney turned quickly, and looked at him steadily, alfost sternly. "Is this another?"  she was thinking. "Is this more of this man's handiwork? Could Grahame Ferguson, be -thrown with a woman with such a head, without experimenting upon her?" And some of the old, sore bitterness and righteous indignation against him came back with the thought. "Do you know her well? Have you ever been intimate with her?" she asked after a minute, choos- ing her words rather slowly. He recognized the meaning of her look and question instantly, and resented it with that accentuated con- sciousness of injured innocence which a generally guilty man always feels on being accused of the only crime he, has not committed. His desire to vindicate himself, and to place her visibly and uncomfortably in the wrong, induced him to answer in a way which he   OPPORTUNITY.       21T otherwise would scarcely have allowed himself; while his angry embarrassment/ gave an emphasis and shade of meaning to his manner of which he himself was hardly aware. "TI know her very well," he replied, " but we have never been intimate in the sense you mean. She is Douglas's specialty," he added, with a slight, unpleas- ant laugh ; "so of course I never interfere." His statement was simple fact; but he knew the impression he was giving, and intended to give, was far beyond the truth. "Ah, indeed!"Harvey responded; and there was all a woman's kindly interest in a love affair in her tone and in the look which once more rested upon Rose Carvel's face. It had taken her a second or two to recollect Doug- las, but :her opinion of him involuntarily rose as she gazed at the woman whom she supposed he loved. "There must be something in the man who could recognize the worthiness of that shrine as a place of, worship," she thought; but, the next moment, began talking of something else, and dismissed the whole subject from both their minds. Ah, if they had known the fruit that moment was to bear! If Grahame had been shown the work which his apparently trivial falsehood would perform, -that it would mould the whole future course of three lives, - would he in his innermost heart have regretted it? I cannot say. Grahame Ferguson was 10  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7732-00000109"/> 218        OPPORTUNITY. not a generous man, and seldom saw the necessity for others to be happy when he was not so himself. As Harvey came out from tea, Mrs. Olmstead and her train also left the room. As Rose passed, Gra- hame touched her on the shoulder. "Rose, let me introduce you to my friend, Miss Berney," he said. Each turned, and looked at the other.  Harvey smiled, and, partly from that little, unconscious pat- ronage with which tall, dark-laired women generally treat small, light ones, and partly from real interest, intended to give her hand. But Miss Carvel dropped her eyes, made the gravest of bows, and passed on. It showed clearly howr much undeniable success had improved Harvey's temper and strengthened her nerves, that, instead of flushing angrily at this slight turning of the tables, she merely looked at Grahame with a-comical little laugh. "It is only Rose's way," he said, rathller apologeti- cally, but in reality he was pleased. When a man rieally cares for a woman, he is never displeased at anything which separates her from others, however indifferent in themselves. "Just so much the more left for me," is invariably his actual sentiment, how- ever unconscious. Your true lover is jealous of a book or a flower, though he would not acknowledge it even to himself. This covetousness of the heart (and per- haps the vanity) demands literally all for its satisfac- tion,   OPPORTUNITY.       219 Rose's manner towards'Miss Berney had arisen from fear and embarrasment; but it was her peculiarity that, when she was shy and nervous, she appeared cold and repellant. She had read Harvey's book with a comprehension it had not won from one person in a thousand; and, since then, its author had been to her an ideal, a wonderful searcher of hearts and reader of thoughts. She had been watching her for the last half-hour with something more than curiosity, as a, being different from ordinary humanity; and to be introduced thus suddenly, and expected to be equal to the occasion, entirely overcame her. A hasty retreat was all of which she was capable. The whole, company loitered pleasantly about the parlors and piazzas until the moon rose, which it did quite early. The band had begun to play, and the ball-room was filling rapidly; but when Grahame proposed to go down on the beach, there were many besides Harvey who readily assented. When they reached it, Harvey found her new acquaintance, Miss Carvel, was of the number. The scene was almost magical in its glorified yet softened radiance. Brilliant as the light of day, there seemed a cool, pale, shinmering veil drawn over all. A stilling, hushing sense of infinitude stole over you as your eyes followed the long reach of level sands until it melted away into nothingness, as you looked -from the swelling breakers that came rolling in, glittering, white-capped, and tumultuous - far, far out s                O  /-  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7732-00000110"/> 220        OPPORTUiITY. over the ocean, until your gaz9 met the heavens that seemed stooping to meet it,--until the faint stars that seemed dropping to rest in its vast bosom carried thought and eye from the dark, shining blue below to the shining blue above. The whole party had kept together, she and Gra- hame forming the nucleus. The rest were very quiet at first, evidently afraid to talk before her. She in- stantly saw that shA was expected to improvise a prose poem, for their benefit, suitable to the surroundings. If there was one thing more than another which Har- vey would not do, it was -to talk " in character." Consequently, being to-night in very high spirits, she was witty, brilliant, piquant; everything but just what they expected, - sentimental and poetical. Yet there was not a light or shadow upon all that changeful sur- face which did not catch her artist's eye; there was not a tone or cadence in that sounding sea which did not sway her poet's soul. But not to such as these would she interpret the beauty she was absorbing into her very nature, to work its own miracles at its own good pleasure. Her mood began to take effect upon those around her. -They all grew talkative, and most of them as witty as was within their power., Grahame was "charmed and thrilled with the old delicious intoxica- tion of being caught up and carried away by a brain power and vitality superior to his own. Yet, though she talked almost exclusively to him, there was some-   OPPORTUNITY.       221 thing wanting; something in exchange for which he would have given all he received. With all her gra- ciousness, there was nothing which he could lay hold of as entirely his own. She might have given jst the same to any congenial, cultivated acquaintance. Rudeness, angry sarcasm, or bitter home truth, any- thing which would be absolutely personal, would be infinitely preferable to and more flattering than this "anybody " manner in which she treated him. But her mood was too strong for him to attempt to change it, under the circumstances; he could only go on en- joying its advantages, though always with this mental reservation. They had been on the beach for two or three hours, and the large party had broken up into somewhat dis- tant groups, when Harvey and Grahame, with Rose and her escort found themselves standing together, much higher up the shore than their late companions. The tide had been out, but was now rising; and they stood silently watching the long, low waves dis- solve in foam, whose white edges each time crept nearer -and nearer their feet. No one was conscious of the duration of the silence. The sea's monotony of motion and sound seemed to fill the void and lull them to quietude. But beautiful as was the scene that lay before her, Harvey gradually forgot it. To her humanity always took precedence of inanimate nature, however imperative the latter's claim might be. They had all been facing rather tip the beach;  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7732-00000111"/> 222        OPPORTUNITY. but in slightly altering her position, Harvey had caught sight of Rose Carvel's face, and had turned completely towards her. "This girl ought only to be viewed by moonlight. She is positively lovely as she stands there," she was thinking with keen aesthetic interest and wondering admiration. "Such calm, sweet eves!" she almost murmured, with that craving, half-sighing envy which the sight of peace of any kind always awoke in her weary, stormy heart. 'And she is thoroughly at ease now; very different from the stiff, cold girl I bowed to. I believe this mystical light and scene has toned her to her real self spiritually as well as physically. One might enter the inner sanctuary now, for the doors of this girl's soul are open to-night." The two women had been nearly facing each other; and in a moment or two more Harvey put her hand upon Rose's shoulder, and with the other motioned her to look out upon the sea at her side. As she obeyed, her faint, inarticulate expression of surprise and pleasure made both men follow her example. It was only a coasting vessel which had come rather close to the shore, and was sailing swiftly by before the freshening breeze; but its broad, white sails with the moonlight upon them, and its gliding, soundless motion, gave it an unearthly effect as of a phantom of light floating between the dark sea and sky, or a great white-winged spirit sweeping past. When it had vanished into the distance and darkness, Rose   4  ' OPPORTUNITY.       223 turned and looked up at Harvey with mute but half- parted lips, with eyes dilating with light, -only this for a moment, but Miss Berney knew she had accom- y,  plished her wish. The others also did not speak. But Grahame made an involuntary angry movement of his foot upon the sand. "She ought to have shown it to me. She ought to have turned to me for sympathy and appreciation, in- stead of to. that girl whom she scarcely knows," he mentally protested. c Has she utterly forgotten the hundreds of times she has done so before?" 4 Suppose we go home," he suggested almost im- mediately. Harvey's hand was still resting upon Rose's shoulder; and the fact, as symbolical of his dis- appointment, irritated him into making some change which would remove it. "Yes," assented Harvey, willingly, "I am tired from travelling." "Take my arm," said Grahame, sententiously. And Miss Berney did as she was bid. Walking slowly back, followed by Rose and her escort at such a distance as to be really alone, Gra- hame made a stroke for his old supremacy. With her hand resting almost upon his heart, with her face so near that he could read its every shade, could search the depths of her eyes for-her soul's secrets, he felt that now if ever was his chance to wring from her something which should be essentially his own. o       O  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7732-00000112"/> 224        OPPORTUNITY.     f By appealing from Present to Past he hoped to stir her in some way, to put away definitely this even sweetness, to destroy this courteous, kindly indiffer- ence, which left him nothing to resent, yet filled him with impotent anger. He had seen the change which time and place had wrought in Rose, and had under- stood its effect upon Harvey even while it so angered him. "So you read character by moonlight as well as by firelight," he presently said. He well knew that the' vivid picture of that long-gone scene in the office at Bonbrook, when she had sketched their hearts and lives as reflected in the coals, would flash before her at his words. As he spoke he looked into her very eyes, his own eager and expectant. Had her eyes grown tender with memory, had they softened or their glance faltered, Grahame Ferguson would have felt that heaven had come down to him, as once before under her influence he had almost im- agined that he had been caught up to it. Had they recoiled as though touched too closely home, had they resisted with a pride whose other side, whose real name, was pain, had they even dilated with anger, he would have thrilled to his heart with the intensity of his relief, would have held and followed his advantage bravely. What they did was to look back at him rather wearily, but quite serenely, as she answered with a careless little laugh,- "Oh! you know studying character under all cir- cumstances is my work and my pleasure."   OPPORTUNITY.        225 He had failed utterly, and he knew it. He felt that his right hand trad, at least temporarily, lost its cun- ning in touching the chords of her nature. His dis- appointment was so sudden and sore that lie fairly set his teeth in its first intensity. He walked on without another word until they reached the hotel; when Harvey said "Good night," and he mutely bowed it. He went straight up to his own room. Small, bare, and inconvenient, like most Cape May apartments at that time, its discomforts were preferable to the chawce of meeting people, and having to talk in his present frame of mind. He opened the window with some unnecessary violence, swearing at the slight re- sistance it made, and feeling rather relieved by the expression. Then he flung him-self into a chair that stood by the casement, and sat so filled with a sick, sullen sensation of failure that he could not think de- finitely of anything. But the distant, incessant roll of the breakers jarred upon his unstrung nerves, just as it had done early in the afternoon; and presently he shut the sash as vehemently as he had raised it. Then he tried walking up and down the room; but as there was hardly space to turn round, this really would not do; and he was fain at last, though it was scarce-  ly eleven o'clock, to take refuge in bed. Once there he began to cool down. After all, pain- ful and irritating as the blow had been, it was really but a flesh-wound. Neither his hopes nor his vanity had been vitally struck, though both had been shaken 10             o  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7732-00000113"/> 226        OPPORTUNITY. from their centres. Where Harvey Berney was con- cerned, Grahame's comfortable self-reliance always de- serted him with his equally comfortable indifference. But laving won so often where he had not cared for the victory, and had made but the slightest effort to gain it, it really was not in human vanity to quite despair in this case, where he cared so intensely, and meant to do battle so valiantly for success. As he lay there, and the hours went by, the acuteness of his dis- appointment naturally lessened; and as memory after memory of the old time and their old relative position, of his power then to sway her very soul, came throng- ing back, his feeling changed sensibly. "What an idiot I am!" he suddenly exclaimed to himself. "i' It is all that pride of hers, which always took the very form you least expected, and which would make her die rather than show signs of sur- render. To judge Harvey Berney in anything by the usual whistle-and-I-will-come-to-you standard is simply ridiculous," he added, with a laugh of con- tempt for himself which restored his equilibrium wonderfully. "And sle shall love me! she shall love me!" he broke out audibly with a fierce energy, a concentrated passion and force so unlike himself that it seemed as though his father's strong spirit -and hot blood had for the moment filled the weak nature and frame he had inherited from his mother. "I was  fool enough to let her slip through my fingers years ago; but I'll hold on to my chance this time," he   OPPORTUNITY.       227 muttered to himself, and his hand involuntarily clenched itself, as though grasping his purpose even physically, as though emphasizing it with his entire being. Could he have watched Harvey after she had reached her roota, or rather could the power have been given him to read the essential meaning of slight outward signs, would not his sudden force and fire have sunk down to the dreary ashes of despair? Had this evening occurred but a very few years before, it would have been she who sat by the window restless and nervous, recalling every word and look, and view- ing them in every possible aspect,--going through that ingenious self-torture, that alternate exaltation and utter depression, by which lovers wear out their souls. The Past, with its varied memories, would have come back to her, as it had to him, and' thrown its magic reflection over the Present. To have slept, until sheer weariness had calmed her down, would have been simply impossible. As it was, as she stood smoothing out the masses of black hair that fell upon her shoulders, she was calmly thinking - with ideas rendered a little misty and vague by fatigue - how beautiful the scene on the beach had been, and how she had enjoyed it all. That last allusion Grahame had made had been the only shadow; but she put it aside, as she habitually did any reference to a period of her life which was now to her as a terrible delu- sion. Then she went peacefully to sleep, with no 4  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7732-00000114"/> 228-       OPPORTUNITY. thought of Grahame breaking her rest, with only Rose Carvel's pale face dawning upon her dreams. If Grahame Ferguson could have seen and under- stood all this, would he not have learned that the heart of this woman was to him dead beyond resurrection? "'-*   OPPORTUNITY.;       229 CHAPTER    XVI. THE soft, summer twilight, whose stillness seemed only accentuated by the low hum of the crickets and the far-off cry of the whippoorwills, was gather- ing over Douglas Ferguson's home- as he and Ridge Beckwith sat upon the porch, with the blue smoke of their inevitable cigars floating off on the evening air. Ridge had come down from Baltimore that after- noon, and the two had dropped immediately into that silent, restful companionship which was, perhaps, their friendship's chief charm. "'I suppose you know Grahame is at Cape May," Ridge presently remarked; " as usual, conquering and to conquer,' I hear.' "Ah, indeed!"Dougs lazily responded, his inter- est in his brother's social pursuits being but moderate. "Di, suppose you and I take up our pilgrim staffs once more, and go down to the seashore. I have been feeling the need of a change all the summer, and somehow th'ese green fields don't seem exactly what I want," said Ridge, slowly. 4"Well, I scarcely know," Douglas began, hesitat- ingly; for, being extremely comfortable, change did not strike him agreeably. "There it is again!" exclaimed Ridge, with unex- i  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7732-00000115"/> 230        OPPORTUNITY. pected energy. "The truth is, Di, you are getting to be a regular old fogy. I have noticed it growing on you for a year past." "My dear fellow," said Douglas, breaking out into one of his cheery laughs, "6I am perfectly willing to go, if you really wish it. There is no necessity for calling one dreadful names." "Will you really go?" "Certainly," Douglas answered, and, by that single word, took the turning in his life's path which was to lead him so straight and so swiftly to the fate which had long awaited him. For a few moments Ridge was contented with con- templating his success, but presently he returned to his mutton. "I was not calling names; I was simply stating a fact. I must say," he went on, with a tone in his voice which showed Douglas instantly that he was giving expression to an idea which had been in his mind for some time, " if I were truly your disinter- ested friend, I should tell you to fall in love and mar- ry as the best remedy. You had better do both while you can, before the best period of your life is gone forever." Again Douglas laughed, this time softly and pleas- antly. "I have been in love all my life," "What!" cried Ridge, with a sharpened tone like painand anxiety in his voice.   OPPORTUNITY:       231 "Don't be alarmed. It is only my ideal woman whom I have worshipped thus faithfully; but she has always been so vivid and perfect that she has extin- guished all other women for my eyes, as the sun would put out a candle." "And you hope one day to see this ideal realized, to meet this woman in the flesh." 1"Yes," Douglas answered. '"Or at least some one who will seem to me to realize it," he added, as the other's manner fell upon him like a shadow, reminding him that our highest joys often come from blessed ' illusions. "And, having found her, you hope to make her love you. My God! man, what have you ever done to dare to dream of such a fate? why should he grant you his richest gift?"Ridge suddenly cried out with something like passionate despair. "We can each but stand in our own lot," Douglas answered humbly, " taking our chance of victory or defeat. But I have always thought that even the best of us gains a woman's love as they tell us we gain heaven,- not through any worthiness of his own, but by pure grace. I should hope to conquer my lady- love as Sir Thomas Browne says lie conquered his religious doubts, --'not in a martial attitude, but upon my knees.' " ( God help you 1" said Ridge, softly; but it sounded more like a prayer that he might be aided in, mortal peril than a claim for assistance towards victory. ,              . .'  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7732-00000116"/> 232    '   OPPORTUNITY. And you too," answered Douglas, taking the words in this latter meaning, and laying his hand gratefully upon the other's shoulder. The twilight had so deepened that he did not per- ceive that Ridge's lips had grown colorless; but he did notice, and thought it somewhat natural after their talk, that he scarcely spoke again during the whole evening. Three days after, Harvey was standing in her room, getting ready for an afternoon drive with Grahame. She had heard the stages drive up; and in a little while saw, through her partially opened door, her in- tended escort coming up the stairway with two gen- tlemen. The smaller one she recognized as Ridge Beckwith, with whom she had a slight acquaintance; but the tallest of the three was an entire stranger. "But what a magnificently ugly man!"Harvey mentally exclaimed, as Douglas came striding along at his brother's side in his old half-boyish, half-lordly way, strangely dwarfing and taming Grahame's style and symmetry into smooth commonplace. "I won- der who he can be!" The next moment the companionship, and one of those subtile family likenesses which only strike us at first sight, and fade completely away with familiarity, answered her question; The new-comers were evi- dently going to their rooms ; but as they passed Rose's door, which was just across the passage, they stopped, apparently at Grahame's suggestion, while he knocked.   OPPORTUNITY.       233 Coming olft with her usual gray-pale face, Rose saw why she had been called, and who awaited her. In another second Harvey saw that face transfigured into the spiritual loveliness she had first seen it wear upon the beach, on the night of her coming, and which she had supposed to be a miracle moonlight alone had power to work, "Ah! now it will be moonlight at all times," she thought. She could not see Douglas's face, or hear what was being said; but his manner as he bent over Rose's hand--with his old tenderness for his child-friend blending with his deference for the woman, - struck Harvey as very beautiful in itself and not at all inap- propriate in the lover she supposed him to be. She was rather surprisedrat a man choosing to meet his lady-love in the presence of other men; but she re- membered that it had ben Grahame's doing, and so accounted for it. In a moment or two they passed on; and Harvey, taking up her hat and gloves, went down to the porch to await Grahame's almost imme- diate return. They were scarcely seated in the carriage when Harvey said:-- :  "I suppose that was Douglas with you just now." She made no comment upon him, but the way in which she asked the question, a certain quickened interest in eye and voice, showed Grahame that Douglas had im- pressed her at first sight as he always did persons who knew anything of life and society.  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7732-00000117"/> 234-       OPPORTUNITY. "Yes," he answered quietly, and nothing more was said on either side. But somehow the whole bloom and beauty of the evening had suddenly vanished for him.  He had been really pleased -at his brother's arrival on the island, but now he was almost unconsciously wish- ing him anywhere else on earth. The instant after he had connected Harvey and Douglas in his own mind, he found it impossible by any effort of will to disunite them; his ideas of both seemed to fuse by a natural fitness that mnade his heart sink. Never in his life had he. felt his real inferiority t2 his brother so acutely as he did while they drove on for the next half-hour almost in silence; not for years had his old sense of self-abasement swept over him so completely. But presently Harvey, excited by the air and mo- tion, began talking and laughing with such fresh, gen- uine gayety that he was charmed out of the recollec- tion of his doubts and fears. Her manner was just what it had been since her coming; but he had grown accustomed to it, and the contrast with what it had once been did not strike him so vividly. Its easy, kindly friendliness, its utter lack of the subtile warmth or personality of either love or anger, still gave him a sensation of starving amid plenty; but the pain had settled into a dull, chronic aching,lover which he ac- cepted and -enjoyed what the hour presented. His foiled attempt upon the first hight had shown him that all effort to take up the threads of what had gone   OPPORTUNITY.       235 before was worse than useless. "Let the dead Past bury its dead," was the decision she had then made. Neither the light nor the shadow of the days gone by, neither the darkness nor the glory of the long ago, should enter the calm, sweet sunshine of the present. So absolute was this barrier, that not the slightest ref- erence to her novel, with its strange chronicle of both their lives, had ever been made by either. Their Past seemed potent and visible in what it took away, not-in what it gave ; in its impoverishment, not its en- richment of the Present. t There were moments when these invisible trammels so maddened him that he would intentionally show himself at his worst, in the hope of seeing the old, passionate pain and anger, the old amazed, sorrowful contempt, flash up in the splendid dark eyes and over the strong, haughty face. But it never came. She would look at him with that half-weary, half- kindly tolerance one gives to a wilful child, from whom scarcely anything better can be expected. In the days when she had imagined him capable of all great and good things, would he but arouse himself to them, she had held him to a terribly strict accounta- bility, had judged him by her own high standard; but now that she knew him for what he was, now that she perfectly realized the boundaries and weaknesses of this feeble nature, it filled her neither with aston- ishment nor indignation that he should act in accord-  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7732-00000118"/> 236  -     OPPORTUNITY. ance with them/ It was the partial perception of this lost faith andits dreadful justice, almost as much as his consciosness of his vanished power, which made Grahameirly gnash his teeth with helpless pain as- lie met her unruffled glance. But generally, as upon this afternoon, he smothered down the hungry craving at his heart, and eagerly caught the fair, unsatisfying fruit the moment brought forth. Returning quite late, they had the dining-room al- most to themselves while they drank tea. Then Har- vey hastily dressed for the evening, and they strolled off to the beach to meet the many acquaintances whom similarity of taste was sure to collect there. In this way Douglas saw nothing of his brother. The afternoon he had consumed in wandering around with Ridge, and the evening he had spent with Rose. He had joined her coming out from tea; and sitting upon the porch in the twilight, which soon became starlight, they had had a long, tender talk of their ear- ly days. So completely did they fall again into their old relations, that, before he knew it, he was calling her "Rosy"; treating her with just the gentle, lov- ing care he had bestowed upon her forlorn childhood; confiding to her, as then, thoughts and feelings which he had never shown to any other being. So perfect was memory's illusion, that, had they been at home, it would have struck him as quite natural to have lifted i her to her place upon his knee as of old. And Rose? Ah, Harvey was right!   All hours   OPPORTUNITY.       237 were now radiant to her with a magic light.- No night could be so gloomy but that the moon beamed for her if Douglas Ferguson were there; no day so dark but sunlight parted its shadows when he ap- peared. With that strange tenacity and single-mind- edness which belongs to such natures, she had carried  the thought of him in her heart through all these years, as to her the one man on earth; for his sake she had lived among the gayety and crowd around her as truly and spiritually a little nun as though she had dwelt within the stillness of convent walls. Now her long waiting was rewarded. He had come back unchanged, to receive the full richness of a nature which she had treasured for him as no miser ever hoarded gold. She was utterly content. For one hour there was vouchsafed to her that rarest of blessings, perfect happiness, - but for the first and last time. It was the crowning moment of her exist- ence, as she recognized before another night and day had passed. Looking back upon it afterwards, it seemed to stand alone and apart from the rest of her life, to wear a halo around it in her memory. Not only his slightest tone and look remained vivid and perfect in her thought, but not the smallest of their outside surroundings ever faded from her recollection. The darkness without, faintly lighted by glimmering stars; the sound of music and dancing from the ball- room, just sufficiently remote to form a happy, soften- ed accompaniment to their happy, softened mood,-  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7732-00000119"/> 238        OPPORTUNITY. to think of this hour in after days was to see and hear both as parts of a perfect whole from which nothing could be taken. "Ah me! an irruption of the Goths and Vandals," Douglas suddenly exclaimed; and Rose turned to see Mrs. Olmstead and her train bearing down upon them. With a little discomfited bow' and laugh, he passed down to the other end of the long porch, where Ridge sat by one of the ball-room windows idly watching the dancers within. Settling himself upon the other side of the window, he fell willingly into his friend's mood and occupation. That sense of peace and rest with which Rose Carvel blessed those who came near enough to appreciate her delicate influence so thoroughly enwrapped him, that, as he gazed listlessly at the bright gliding figures, light, harmony, warmth, and happiness seemed all it was possible for life to contain. Coming up from the beach quite late, Harvey and Grahame entered the ball-room; he merely from a desire to see what was going on, but she with the definite purpose of meeting Rose, and tracing how far the wondrous change in her was permanent. The girl was standing rather alone, near the window out- side of which sat Douglas and Ridge. Approaching with some pleasant general remark, Harvey looked down upon that pale face, now illumined as from some shaded inner light. What she read there touched to quick answering sympathy that which was highest,   OPPORTUNITY.        239 truest, and most delicate in her own nature. All that was tender, noble, and womanly in Harvey Berney's soul looked out of Harvey Berney's eyes it that mo- ment. And thus it was Douglas Ferguson first saw her, - saw her, and in that second of time knew, with a certainty not an eternity of intercourse could have strengthened, that the woman he had so long sought stood before him, that he was gazing at Iis- long-wor- shipped ideal realized and embodied. It was to him simple recognition; that which he had "4 seen through a glass darkly" he now saw "face to face." So perfect was the fulfilment of his hope and thought, that he seemed to hlave met the being most familiar to him; mot only the image which had dwelt in his mind's eye so long, but a face upon which his physical sight had often rested. His first glad, almost overpowering impulse was to put out his hand and greet her, in the faith that she must know and recognize him. He started up with such an eager light in his eyes, such a breathlessness upon his lips, that Ridge hurriedly rose and stood beside him, glancing into the ball-room to sea who or what had so roused him. "Who is it?" said Douglas, as Ridge's eyes fol- lowed his to Harvey, standing directly before them, though so unconscious of their vicinity. "That is Harvey Berney." Douglas had heard the name a score of times as that of a literary woman, though he never read her book; but at the second his memory left all that be-  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7732-00000120"/> 240        OPPORTUNITY. hind, and flashed back to the chill, misty morning years before whenihe had first listened to it. "That boy had the soul of a gentleman, for he recognized her even then," he mentally exclaimed. "And I too might have met her, if I had only known, if I had not unconsciously thrown away the chance," he suddenly thought, with a sharp, regretful pang of-self-anger, with some of the jealous pain with which an heir thinks of his heritage possessed in his absence by usurpers. Had he dreamed what this thought was to become to him in the days now drawing near, could he have shaken it off, as he did, standing high-hearted and re- joicing? "I heard she was staying here," Ridge presently went on, as the other made no answer to his informa- tion.   "She is looking uncommonly handsome to- nighlt." It was so. If she had premeditated this moment, she could scarcely have chosen anything moredeffective than her surroundings, attitude, or costume. Simple as her dress invariably was, it had now, as evern that puitabil- ity to her singular style which always made her gen- eral appearance impress you like a picture. The deli- cate corn-color of the thin shining material toned her hair, eyes, and complexion to a curious distinct- ness which had the power of brilliancy without its wearying commonplaceness. Across her head, and gathered in long fleecy folds around her shoulders   OPPORTUNITY.       241 (somewhat as a Spanish lady wears her mantilla) was, thrown one of those white knitted , clouds," tnen so much worn at the seaside. Gazing at her, Douglas was vaguely reminded of those pale, glim- mering yellow sunsets, when, except the soft bands of white cloud flecked with black, the only color seems more truly concentrated golden light. He did not remember that such sunsets tell surely of storm for the coming rnorrow. Talking pleasantly together, Harvey, Rose, and Grahame passed out into the hall to the foot of the stairway, which led to the ladies' rooms, and there loitered for a few minutes before separating for the night. The moment they moved, Douglas left his post of observation, and, coming swiftly up the porch, stood in the hall door within a few yards of them. Catching sight of his brothler's face wearing such an expression as he had certainly never seen upon it be- 'fore, Grahame suddenly remembered his existence; and his instinctive jealousy was upon him again in a sec- ond. But with all his manifold faults and weaknesses, Grahame was by education a gentleman; and what- ever might be his spiritual lack of honor and truth towards women, where men were concerned he ac- knowledged a code, and held himself accountable for its fulfilment. He might fear, and even hate his brother at the moment; but for that very reason he must de- prive him of no advantage which the other might rightfully claim from him. "            p  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7732-00000121"/> 242        OPPORTUNITY. Summoning him by a slight gesture, he would have presented him to Harvey; but Douglas's head gave a quick, imperative movement of dissent, and turning abruptly, he gazed out upon the porch until the others went their several ways. Douglas rather feared, what was not the case, that Harvey had seen his apparent rudeness. But he felt that he could not have acted differently. He could not bring himself to take his own as a favor from any other hands, especially from those which in his soul he despised for their feeble faithlessness. No one else must step between them, he must enter into his possessions alone and by his own effort. The conventional politeness of others seemed to him mere impertinence and triviality if interposed between two beings who, he held, had walked the long course of their lives solely for this hour of meeting. Like all strong-natured persons, his first necessity under intense feeling was to be by himself. He went straight to his room as the nearest available solitude and stillness. He and his whole world had changed utterly in the last few moments, and the realization of this demanded and occupied his entire being. "I saw a new heaven and a new earth " seemed to him but literal fact. He had all his life heard of " instantane- ous conversion " and " a new birth " with a mental inability to believe in their existence. He had now a vague consciousness that such things were possible. It was several hours before Ridge came up to the   OPPORTUNITY.       24t room which the crowded state of the hotel compelle( them to share. He and Grahame had gotten into : long talk, and neither had thought of retiring unti after midnight. When he did so, he found Dougla yet dressed, but lying across the bed so still that he supposed him to be asleep. Ah no I not sleeping, only dreaming. !  v          .       7  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7732-00000122"/> 244        OPPORTUNITY. CHAPTER XVII. A S Harvey seldom went into the breakers, much preferring sea air to sea water, Grahame was not surprised when, the next morning, she announced that she should not go down to the beach that day. Eleven o'clock arriving, and every one else going off to bathe, Grahame proposed to his brother and Ridge that they should do likewise. As that was just the purpose for which Ridge had come to the- island, he readily assented. But Douglas declined, saying he would stay where he was. In fact, he was glad that they should leave. He had determined to speak to Harvey for himself and by himself, and he hoped some opportunity might this morning come close enough for him to seize. At any rate, he would not risk losing the chance. The event proved that his instinct was not at fault. The room which Harvey and her mother occupied was rather small and uncomfortable; so, knowing that the large, airy hotol-parlor was at this hour as empty and quiet as a privgte apartment, she brought down a late novel, intending to make herself comfortable upon one of the sofas. But seeing the piano open, she sat down before it, and began half idly singing and playing to herself.   OPPORTUNITY.       24 Harvey's singing was only another instance of th- truth of what she had long ago said of herself, - tha she had received but one gift from heaven, expression but it had been given her in every possible form. Th rare beauty which came and went so strangely in he face, the power in her pen and the thrill in her voice were only speech through different mediums. Thi last form was perhaps the most perfect. It was he peculiarity, that, though she had faithfully studied wide ranige of the best music, she never sang wha you might hear from any one else. It was alway some English or German ballad; some song so old a to have become new; som9 beautiful, quaint air which she herself had married to its other half of words some exquisite little poem, unnoticed by ordinarj readers of English literature, which she had set t music, her own or another's,--these she gave yot from an apparently endless store. Not only her sing ing but her songs 7were attractions as- essentially he own as her eyes or her smile. Douglas had been walking a sort of lazy sentry upor the piazzas, partly from home habit. Coming past th( parlor door he heard the sound, and, looking in, sax who was the singer. He drew a rather lengthener breath, and set his mouth unconsciously more firmly but stood quietly upon the step just within her sigh until the song was- ended. Then he came across the room, and leaning upon the piano said,- "( Will you sing for me?"'  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7732-00000123"/> 246        OPPORTUNITY. /  Harvey looked up at him with some astonishment and more curiosity in her great, grave eyes. She rec- ognized him instantly, and examined him with no lit- tle interest to see how this closer inspection bore out- her first impression. The rugged, almost dogged strength of the countenance; a certain purity in the formation of the features, despite their large irregular- ity, the rare sensitiveness in the eyes and around the nmouth; the latent capacity for passion which might be his weakest-or strongest point, - all these were very plain to that subtile reader of faces, as she sat gazing up at him for the moment or two she took to decide whether her answer should be yes or no. :Had her survey disappointed her, or his manner lacked the finest shade of deference, she would have risen calmly, and excused herself. But he was so thoroughly unaffected, so clearly one of those hea- then who are a law unto themselves, that it would have been as easy to suspect a child or an emperor of impertinence. Douglas made little effort to hurry her decision. He was looking for the first time deep down into the eyes of the woman he loved, and it, seemed to him then he would be willing for that mo- r ment to continue through all eternity. "Yes, she would sing to him; he had a right to ask it in that he was worthy of it," was her mental conclusion. "And now what should it be? Not what would rouse his wonder, or his admiration for her, but what would stir deepest, would carry him out of him- self." f                /   OPPORTUNITY.        24i This inward questioning, this penetrating choice, or rather test, Harvey always exercised when she will ingly sang for one person, whether that person wers alone or in a crowd "Its answer could be the highes compliment of which she was capable. Playing long, low chords, she looked up into th, man's face, letting what she there read decide he answer.  The ineffable content at his heart coulh but be visible in the faint light over his face, but i did not; hide to Harvey  its sleeping power an( passion, it seemed rather by contrast to develoj them.  But behind even these lay the something which she chose to touch. She passed 'by all thos wonders of song by which humanity hb   most trul expressed its inner life, and went back intuitively t the' simplest of German ballads, which long year before some one had brought home from the Soutl Pacific, hearing it sung on Sunday evenings by th German sailors on shipboard. It was only the ol tale of love and sorrow, of spring-time and flower which now could only bring back the memory of, al it had once brought in such truth,-only this, toll in the simplest possible words and nrotes, - but ther was utter heart-break in every tone. "OFather, mry Father in Heaven! Thou hast taken my loved one to thee; And though many andcfair in her stead thou hast given, ,On this earth there is not one for me." She sung it as never before in her life. And we: -               &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7732-00000124"/> 248        OPPORTUNITY. she might. She had scarcely concluded the first verse, before the man turned abruptly, and stood al- most with his back to her. Harvey fairly thrilled with pleasure as she saw how true her instinct had been. The tears in the eyes, the lips held together to steady them, were as evident to her as though he were still gazing down at her. She had certainly had her wish, she had thrown him completely out of him- self. i She finished her song, but he did not move; and, after playing soft modulations for a moment or two, she rose to go. Then he turned, and put out his hand. She sim- ply looked up at him, making no corresponding move- ment.  She detested indiscriminate hand-shaking; -her, voluntary touch had the worth and meaning of -a caress. It was no common man who stood before her, she well knew; but still he was a stranger, ,and she had given him enough without bestowing upon him that which to her was so much while to him it might be so little. She ignored the extended hand, supposing he would withdraw it. But he did nothing of the kind. He read her thought perfectly in her face, and she saw that- he did so. "The hand of Douglas is his own " flashed upon her. The man's palm was evidently held as high as her's, was offered as seldom; he was asking no more than he gave. She granted it instantly. When exquisitely touched or charmed, this great fellow would flush like a woman ; though, indeed, no   OPPORTUNITY.       249 woman's pulses have power to send out such a red tide- as mounted to his very brow as he held her, hand in his strong clasp. She had not only done just what he wished, but just as he wished it. Had she given it with the readiness of courteous indifference, it would have pained and repulsed him far more than absolute refusal; whatever had been her action, had it arisen from commonplace'conventionality, he could not have escaped an unacknowledged sense of disappointment in her. But this very shrinking, this weighing him in the balance and not finding him wanting, -this yielding to his individualitywthat which she would have surely withheld had he been but as other men, - what were all these but the recognition he had claimed? The be- lief so filled him that it'was a positive shock to him when, a moment after, Harvey took away her hand, and left the room. How dead the past had become to her was very clear from the fact that this meeting failed to recall to her memory, that just in the same position, and with- out preliminary introduction, Grahame had first spoken to her. Yet thus early that fatality appeared by which these two men unconsciously matched each other's ac- tions with reference to this woman,; thus early did the unity of their destiny with regard to her develop it self in seeming trifles, as it was so soon and so decis ively to do at the turning-point of each life. When Harvey came down to dinner that day, she looked with a much-quickened interest towards Rose "  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7732-00000125"/> 250        OPPORTUNITY. Carvel's place. Accepting her engagement with Dou- glas Ferguson as a fixed fact, she expected to see him sitting next her. But he was not there; and, follow- ing the direction of Rose's averted face, she saw him dining with Ridge at the other end, of the room. But being herself so regardless of mere custom, this did not at all shake her belief in their connection. The scene of the morning had unconsciously excited her, and she was in unusual spirits, of which Grahame reaped the benefit, though an instinct prevented her from mentioning his brother, or alluding in any way to their meeting.  Talking more and better than in general, it was natural that about five o'clock a slight reaction should set in. She was both flushed and tired; so, slipping away from the large party with which she had been sitting in the crowded parlor, she went up to her room, intending to lie down until tea-time. But, opening the door, she found her mother there asleep; and fearing to disturb her, closed it softly, and went out on the piazza upon which its window opened. Their room was at its corner, and they,possessed in consequence several advantages. As no one was obliged to pass through their end of the porch, Harvey had carried hither all their available chairs, and used it as a sitting and reception room. Its open angle gave them not only a lookout towards the sea, but in the evening a view of the sun setting in the opposite direction. It was to her the pleasantest spot in the house, and not   - OPrPORTUNITY.      251 to her only; both Grahame and Rose also held it such, and the happiest hours of each for many days had here been passed. They and some dozen more of Harvey's intimate acquaintances were very apt to tend hither in the early morning and toward even- ing.' Although she was the centre of the circle, their X meeting on neutral ground relieved her from any re- sponsibility for their entertainment, while the open air and the entire lack of ceremony supplied in them- selves a piquant charm. It was here Harvey now came, to " rest and cool down," as she mentally phrased it. Sitting by the railing, with her arm laid upon it and her hdad upon that, she soon forgot the heat and noise be- low,- forgot everything but the cool sea-breeze and her own pleasant sense of indolent fatigue;- her only conscious idea being a vague wish that none of the usual set might wander in that direction and disturb her. She had begun to think her desire would be gratified, when she saw Douglas Ferguson step from one of the rooms opening on the porch, and come along it, on his way down stairs, - saw, too, by the quick change in his eyes, the moment in which he perceived and recognized her. "He is coming here.  He will talk, and expect me to answer and entertain him," she exclaimed to herself the second after, in absolute horror; and turned her face resolutely towards the sea in a sort of impatient desperation.  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7732-00000126"/> 252        OPPORTUNITY. Come he certainly did; sitting down within a few feet of her, and leaning upon the same railing. But when she listened with vibrating nerves for him to speak, she listened in vain. Five, ten minutes passed, and still he showed as little desire as herself to break the silence. She began to comprehend that her fear of disturbance had been quite unnecessary, and sank back into her previous state of lazy enjoyment, with only a sense of relief occupying her thoughts. But gradually a certain interest and curiosity in the man so near her began to arise. That his stillness was not constraint she was instinctively aware by those slight unconscious changes of position on his part which we only make when perfectly at ease. She turned her head sightly- to see his face, with a faint wonder as to what she would read there. He was looking out towards the sea, with eyes to the full as dreamy as her own had been, but with a blissful peace shedding a strange softness over the entire countenance. If the quietude and rest soothed and harmonized with her mood and nature, surely here was one to whom they were even more positive hap- piness. "A man to be silent with!" dawned upon Harvey. She had known scores of men wonderfully adapted to talk with, but most of them had filled her with secret weariness just in -proportion to their brilliancy; -she had had many good listeners, people who draw you out, and in the end wear you out; but a man to -be   OPPORTUNITY.        253 silent with was a blessing Heaven had sent her for the first time. She simply laid her head again upon he: arm, though with her face now turned in his direction and sat filled with this strangely new form of enjoy ment, this fresh phase of existence. Here was at intercourse too delicate, too subtile to be put int, words; a communion which involved no exhaustive cost of vitality, which fed and replenished the forceq of both soul and body. Here there seemed no giving with either, it was all receiving. - She began to under stand that this, and this only, was the companionship which could be endured for- a lifetime, - this which was its own wellspring, which brought its own renew ing, its eternal youth. "Ben was right, we are alike," Harvey suddenl: thought, recollecting the remark for the first time since it was made, and with it came back the memor: of the boy's enthusiasm for the man before her. "I have never seen so manly or so womanly : face," she was thinking, as she lay gazing intently a it. He seemed to feel her look, for he turned toward her with a half-questioning smile which she evidently might answer or not as she chose. "We certainly have not taxed each other conver sationally this afternoon," she said, with answering smile ; catching at the first generality which came t her to cover the slight embarrassment her real though had occasioned. "No," he returned slowly, almost dreamily, " bu  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7732-00000127"/> 254.       OPPORTUNITY. the pleasure of companionship to me is never what is said; it is the consciousness of presence." Harvey's eyes were larger and darker than ever, as she sat for the next five minutes in perfect silence. "Mr. Ferguson," she said at last, speaking from a sudden impulse, " will you grant me a favor?" I wonder if any keener pleasure is ever' vouchsafed to a man than that of hearing the woman he loves ask some pretty grace or aid at his hands; in all this world's gettings or besto-;ings is there one to compare to this sweet beggary and alms? The thrill that went over Douglas's face-told so truly its own story, that Harvey almost started, though the next moment she reddened with self-disgust. "Have I grown idiotic with vanity," she angri- ly thought, " that I should fancy this man is falling in love with me, when I know that it is Rose whom he loves? This is one of ' God Almighty's- gentlemen,+ and could not play at fast and loose with any woman's beart." She was so sure of it, so certain that whatever he did could not be unworthy of the most delicate honor, that the next moment she went on with her sen- tence almost as easily and pleasantly as she had at first spoken: -   Tell me, if you can, were you thinking or mere- ly existing, as you sat here a little while ago, looking as though you had attained perfect content?" Douglas gazed at her for a moment or two without   OPPORTUNITY.       255 answering. He could not tell her all his thought, - not yet, not quityetet. He could not reveal to her the hope which was making such music at his heart. Feeling, sensation, and idea were so commingled, that he could not hbave given her question a definite reply had he wished it. "I scarcely know what I was doing, except being happy," he said presently;," but if I were thinking at all, it was of King David's words; ' So He bringeth them to their desired haven.' " The sea, and some subtile association with the ships which were sailing towards them far under the distant horizon, had, Harvey supposed, brought back to him the beautiful old Hebrew poetry. She little imagined that it was his acknowledgment, his thanksgiving to God for having brought him to this hour. Had he been a weak man, she would have been surprised to hear one of his age and habits quoting Scripture sc -naturally; but she well knew that it is the instinctive resource of the strong, the tender, and the passionately earnest. "It is curious," she pondered wonderingly, ' but I could have found no fitter expression for my own feel- ing than the first half of that very verse:; Then they are glad, because they be quiet.' " She probably would have told him her thought, but the next second footsteps just beside them made them turn. There stood Rose and- Grahame. They had met on the stairway on their way hither as usual,  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7732-00000128"/> 256        OPPORTUNITY. and "each stopped and hesitated before a scene which filled both with such utter amazement. When, the night before, Douglas had refused his proffered introduction to Harvey, the relief to Gra- hame would be hard to overstate. Yet he had at that moment experienced his first sensation of contempt for his brother. '( Afraid of a literary woman, I sup- pose," he had thought with delighted surprise, and felt like shouting for joy at the unexpected barrier which 'he fancied Douglas's ' mauvaise honte' would raise be- tween them.  Under this impression he had come upon the sight before him,--a sight whose higher ele- ment, whose spiritual: meaning, was as clear to him as was the repose, the almost intimacy, of air and atti- tude. The acquaintanceship he could attribute to Ridge; but here was something which a man must- win for himself, or never win. He had known her for long years, but in all their course he had but once approximated to this closeness of relationship, -on that fatal day when sihe -ad gone down upon her knees at his side in the old office at Bonbrook; yet in a few hours, it might be moments, Douglas had reached at least the door of the inner sanctuary. His perception of their absolute fitness returned to him with the force of destiny. He had been standing there but a moment when they saw him, but that moment had sufficed to bring a'strangely worn look- into his face. The change the new-conmers made in Harvey was   OPPORTUNITY.       257 as entire as it was instantaneous. The careless, laughing gayety she might have shared with a hun- dred acquaintances was drawn like a mantle over the nature which had been lying so clearly revealed, when she greeted Grahame, and called to Rose not to go, as she seemed about to do, but to come and sit next her. As she obeyed, Harvey expected to see the lovely light of happiness upon her face which it had worn at their last meeting. To her astonishment its expres- sion was the counterpart of Grahame's look. It might well be, for it was the result of the same cause. The same perception, the same conviction, had burst upon her like a revelation. In that single secon'd she had awakened from the dream of a lifetime. Sitting there, answering a little gravely, but quite readily and con- nectedly, all that was said to her, she took in the whole situation, and surrendered as utterly as to Fate Harvey, supposing her tired or not quite well, soon left her undisturbed ; and, turning to Grahame, talked and made him talk, as she could always do. At their coming Douglas had risen, and was now standing, leaning upon the railing, almost with his back to them. To him also that moment had brought its own trouble. In it had been born that jealousy which, in the heart of a strong man, is inseparable from love. Seeing his brother suddenly and unex. pectedly, Grahame's personal advantages struck: him as never before. Perhaps the very emotion withir the man gave his beauty and elegance a dignity Q  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7732-00000129"/> 258        OPPORTUNITY. it did not always possess. However that was, he took him in physically almost as a new idea.- Gra- hame's approach had been that of a person very fa-. miliar with the premises, and Harvey's greeting had been cordial; inexplicable as it had always been to him, he knew that his brother's success among women had been almost without break, and with this one he remembered he had been thrown intimately very early in her life. During those weeks which Grahame had spent at Bonbrook, she had been there. The chance of knowing her which he had then thrown away the other had the opportunity to use to the uttermost; and what degree of influence might not this experi- enced woman-charmer have gained over her passion- ate nature in its impressionable immaturityv, might not from this vantage-ground maintain to the present day? Thus his dread that he might have come too late first awoke, though his instinct brought him. nearer the exact truth than ever afterwards. He remembered that he had noticed a strange change in Grahame during the few hours they had then passed together. "Flirtation number a thousand and one!"- Ridge's careless expression flashed upon him. "Could it be, could it be that- "His sensation refused to shape itself even into definite thought; but he stood there wondering whether, having in the last few hours learned his capacity to love, he was now to learn his capacity to hate. But listening to her words, and scrutinizing her man-   OPPORTUNITY.       259 ner, his fear gradually died away. He not only had his clear brain to aid him in his interpretation of her, but with the jealousy of the lover had come also that sus- ceptibility to the most delicate shades of manner which belongs to love and love only. He had listened but a little while before he felt, rather than saw, the inde- scribable outsideness of her manner, which was to Gra- hame, now as always, like slow torture. Very charm- ing, very perfect in its way, was the entertainment she was giving; but Douglas felt that it would have driven him mad to have received this and nothing more. He had a perception that only indifference can be so gracefully easy; that the fire of love, like the fire of genius, does not wear these pretty proprie- ties, except, indeed, as a mask or veil through which the flame is very visible. It was only of Harvey he thought, it was only the evidence of her feeling which he weighed and meas- ured with such sickening anxiety. Of what Gra- hame's might be he did not waste time to consider. That his brother had ever been capable of a passion which he would have dignified with the name of love he would have scornfully denied; and-that now, when the other had frittered away his emotional nature in a hundred fancies, he should have power for anything beyond weak aesthetic admiration, Dou- glas would have asserted to be simply impossible. Of course Grahame admired her, -that was only her law- ful tribute. ' All hearts do duty unto her beauty "  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7732-00000130"/> 260        OPPORTUNITY. he thought; and his own heart caught up Ben Jon- son's love-hymn and chanted it within him. His doubt had reacted not only into reassurance, but to enthusiasm. Presently he turned and joined in the conversation; talking, to Grahame's astonishment, as he, had never before heard him. He came and stood behind Rose, half leaning upon the back of her chair, with what was to him the old familiarity of childhood, but what seemed to Harvey the freedom of an acknowledged lover. Through all his unwonted earnestness and flow of words, she noticed that there came once or twice little wordless attentions to Rose's comfort, which greatly charmed the other lady, and which she held as far outweighing the direction of his mere mental attention to herself. Now, as so often after, she hmistook that which was habit and innate chivalry in the man for the instinctive tenderness of true pas- sion. But Rose fell into no such error. She had realized the truth perfectly; for her the glamour had forever passed away. This was the kindly protecting care of her childhood, and it was nothing further. She knew that it might as well be father or brother whose hand rested momentarily upon her shoulder. Through it all she sat apparently just her usual quiet self, her habitual pallor and silence covering any increase of either. But she had a sensation of being an automa- ton wound up to run for a certain time, and her most ,   *           f   OPPORTUNITY.       261 distinct idea concerning herself was a vague wonder as to how soon she would be allowed to run down. Grahame also was wondering " how long this thing was to go on," and how long he could bear it. Harvey and Douglas by this time had the conversa- tion entirely to themselves; and it was quite clear that it might continue for hours, if st)me outside influence did not break up the party. Self-consciousness and a dreadful interest in every word and look deprived both Rose and Grahame of any power to do so. At last the tea-gong sounded; and though Harvey lingered until her mother appeared, she then took Rose's hand, and proposed they should all go down together. At the dining-room door, Rose and Douglas neces- sarily left them to take their separate seats; a parting for which one was as inwardly loath as the other was eager. / *  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7732-00000131"/> 262        OPPORTUNITY. CHAPTER XVIII. THAT meeting-upon the porch, radically as it had affected their inner lives, made no correspond- ing change in their outward existences. Except that Douglas and Ridge had now a place and part in all the movements of their little circle, the days which followed that evening very much resembled in exter- nal appearance the days which had precededqit. They walked and danced and rode as before, and in very much the same companionship. Douglas found that by general tacit consent Rose was always given to his charge; somewhat naturally, as society held the same opinion concerning them which Harvey had im- bibed. He was too strong and direct not to make many bold moves for a place at Harvey's side; but the general current, and his delicate fear that Rose might feel that she hampered him, prevented his often reaching or retaining it. Still he lived so constantly in her presence, there were so few hours in which they did not both gain fresh knowledge of each other's natures, so many occasions came when his love could find that wordless speech so intelligible to loving ears, that his lot oftener filled, him with a sense of rapture- than of discontent. Yet this mute   OPPORTUNITY.        263 language failed to convey the meaning he supposed it must carry; failed as much through her very compre- hension of his whole character as from the apparent facts surrounding him. "It is Rose, it is Rose whom he loves," she would mentally repeat, as she sat still and dumb with amaze- ment, not only at some flash of emotion on his part, but at the force and -depth of the corresponding stir in her own heart and blood. Looking in his face, it was impossible to doubt his honor pure and simple; and so, in troubled perplex- ity; she gradually accepted these momentary revela- tions of glance and manner as the slight extravagan- ces of a nature of whose lack of-discipline she was as intuitively conscious as of its broad strength. Favored as usual by circumstances, Grahame re- tained most of' the privileges he had acquired as spe- cial escort to Harvey and her mother. His jealousy of his brother remained, rendering him restless and nervously miserable; but' his long social drill did him good service, and he certainly displayed an ener- gy and determination in fighting for his own, which might have saved him had he shown it earlier in life. As time passed, and no new evidence of the cor- rectness of his fears apparently arose, he began to suppose he might have overrated their original grounds; as Douglas and Harvey seemed to gravi- tate no nearer each other than at their first meeting, both hope and vanity revived, and stimulated him not  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7732-00000132"/> 264        OPPORTUNITY. to surrender except to actual, palpable defeat. These were not happy days to Grahame; but he strove hard to make them such to her, and had a reward, which brought its own sting in the open, careless pleasure she always displayed at his coming. As for Rose, she shrunk utterly into herself. She was always with them, but never of them.  Sbhe might have been a shadow, for any effort on her part to influence or mihgle in the lives of those around her. What she felt ,s her own secret, and she kept it well. Having no power to escape, she simply endured. She had proposed to her aunt to go to some other watering-place; but Mrs. Olmstead had only received the suggestion in lofty astonishment that she should dream it possible she would leave the: seashore until the day on which she invariably left for the Virginia Springs. "Their strength is to sit still." In this, as in each of the strange trials life brought Rose Carvel, she unconsciously illustrated Isaiah's words. No active vitality could have availed her where her? perfect passivity had power to save herself and others. The change in her manner to Harvey was much more perceptible to that lady than it would have been to a mere looker-on. In the weeks they had spent together, there had grown up a very pleasant inti- macy between these women, based upon a rare degree of mutual comprehension. Since the days of her childish confidences to Douglas, Rose had never   OPPORTUNITY.       265 talked so freely, never let thought and feeling flow out almost unconsciously. "Why, Rosebud, I think you only bloom upon my porch!"laughed Harvey one day as they sat there, and the girl gayly assented. But now all this was changed, the charm of their companionship had faded completely away.  They were thrown incessantly together; but, strive as Har- vey would, she could not dissolve the intangible bar- rier of the girl's calm courtesy. The change was everywhere and yet nowhere.  The loss touched Harvey so closely that she left no means untried to break the spell which seemed to bind the other. She singled her out for companionship more than ever; she talked to her of books and poems which had stirred them both deeply; and, these failing, she tried that which she supposed no woman could resist, -apprecia- tive homage to the man she loved, little comprehend- 4 ing that she was sounding the very chord which was producing the discord.  "Do you know," she said, as they stood one morn- nifig by the parlor window, Rose as passive as ever, and the other trying, as usual, to interest hir, " your cousin Douglas strikes me as unlike any one I have ever known? He seems to unite in himself the na- tures of a man, woman, and child. I never look at him without thinking that it could always be said to the woman he loved as the Nurse says to Juliet: 'Your love speaks like an honest gentleman!'

Behind her stood Douglas Ferguson.' Upon his face was the great glow and blush which intense or tender feeling always brought into it, but he said not a word. He only bowed low before her, in what seemed salutation, but which was to him humbled ac- knowledgment for the bounty of her faith and praise. When he next heard her quote those words, the flush in his face and the throb at his -heart came from a dif- ferent emotion. As the days went by, Harvey's little open-air sitting- room became more than ever their customary gather- ing-place. Unless they were driving, or occupied by some other special pleasure, there was scarc an afternoon which did not find them there in jj ter or less numbers. To Douglas these were the happiest of all his hap- py times. If doubt or fear crept over him, they faded quite away in the sunshine which always seemed to I him brooding spiritually and physically over that spot. But the present was so rich and sweet that the shadow of any dread of the future seldom fell upon him, and then only momentarily. In spite of his self-reliance, or rather because of it, he was singularly devoid of' self-conceit (had he possessed more of it, he would have been a more successful man, just as silver be- comes practically useful through alloy), yet he rarely doubted his ultimate success with Harvey. Her rec--   OPPORTUNITY.        26' ognition had been slower than his own, but it could not be less perfect. It seemed to him all Nature's laws must be violated before he could be denied his life's prize when he came to sue for it. Not only his happiness and love, but a faith in their stability, a feeling that the eternal fitness of things demanded that he should receive even as he had given, were never so perfect as in these sunset gatherings. They were marked by few words or actions which definitely helped him towards his end, but they were to-him a blissful drifting upon a stream which brought him ever nearer and nearer a boundless ocean of joy. It was' perhaps two weqks after their coming before any disturbing influence marred the peace or dimmed the brightness of these hours for either Harvey or Douglas. About a dozen of the usual set had drifted hither, and were sitting or lounging around in lazy enjoyment, talking or not, as the mood was upon them. Ridge had dropped into the seat next Harvey, to her evident contentment. They had taken to each other very kindly, though very quietly, from the first; but in the woman he was constantly half arousing a  curious in- terest, which had never yet risen to sufficient acute- ness to induce her to closely analyze it or him. It was not that he was cultured, witty, or well-bred, for- so were all the men of her set; but that there was something about him which she could not remember ever seeing in any one else, and which yet filled her *^-  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7732-00000134"/> 268        OPPORTUNITY. with a vague sense of recognition. It was impossible to call him cynical, he was equally ready with kind act or merry word; but there was an impersonality about his interest in all that went on around him, which affected Harvey like still cold. Underlying all his sympathy and aid in the plans and schemes of others, there seemed a faint astonishment that they could still hope and joy so hotly, that they should still really care for the world's prizes and ambitions. He mingled freely in social life; no one dreamed of calling him a woman-hater, and yet, let him pay her what outward attentions he might, not the vainest of women ever imagined that he loved her. He seemed by some cause to be put out of the combat, and to be simply a looker-on in life. Mentally he gave Harvey the same sensation which we experience at seeing a fair young face surrounded by gray hair. Had she been less happy, less self-absorbed, her psychological instinct would hardly have rested, as it did, in occasional wonder as to what could have changed him from that which he must once have been to that which he now was. Her scarcely defined question was this evening to be answered, -answered with a reactionary influencef upon her own fate which she would have deemed im- possible. But the solution did not come immediately, for the conversation wandered in a desultory way to other characters and persons. Douglas and Grahame, both deprived of the place they coveted, were leaning upon the railing, side by side, just before her.   OPPORTUNITY.       269 '"Esau and Jacob," said Harvey, half in jest and half in earnest, as she looked up at them. , Do: you suspect that I would sell my birthright for a mess of pottage, Miss Berney?"Douglas exclaimed, not doubting for an instant which character she had assigned him. "( No," she replied rather slowly, and much more gravely than she had at first spoken, "you would never sell it, but I should fear you might throw it away without receiving even a mess of pottage in re- turn."- "How the deuce do these women know every- -thing?"' thought Ridge, as he looked at her with that astonishment at feminine perception which comes so often to all men; remembering also that at the only crisis and trial to which Douglas had yet been subjected, Dr. Dan had uttered the same warning. "The idea of steady old Di doing anything desper- ate," laughed Grahame, and by the weight of his ex- perience\seemed to render even discussion of the sup- position absurd. Then he drifted off into pleasant self-delusions as to what feeling had prompted her comparison in his case. - That he had served seven years for her as Jacob for Rachel he thought it must have been, ignoring the fact that he had, done nothing of the kind. Conse- quently both he and Douglas were silent, the latter from a slight chill and soreness which Harvey's words had occasioned him.  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7732-00000135"/> 270        OPPORTUNITY. The mail had come in, and several gentlemen had gone down stairs for their letters, which they were now reading. Suddenly one of them gave an exclamation of such astonishment and excitement that the rest all turned and looked at him. "What do you think is the latest news from Bal- timore?"' he asked. "Somebodyj dead or married?" hazarded a rash voice. "Not quite, but going to be," was the rather in- definite reply. c; Who is it?" cried everybody. "Henrietta Dangerfield and the Honorable Mr. "giving a name then so potent in political life that I hesitate to write it. For a moment or two they were silent with amaze- ment, and then the inevitable tide of question and criticism set in. For many combined reasons this tide set strongly against Henrietta. It seemed taken for granted that not love, but ambition, must have been her motive for the alliance, not only from her apparently icy insensibility, but because the man himself was held incapable of inspiring such an emotion in such a wo- man. That she had deliberately sac;ificed her taste, if not her heart, was the opinion almost each one ex- pressed in a different way. At last some one inno- cently- appealed to Grahame for -his view of the match. Harvey had sat in perfect silence; there were too   OPPORTUNITY.        271 many thoughts and memories thronging back upon her to allow her to speak. She turned now to see if he could possibly do so, could calmly criticise the le- gitimate result of his own work. He was not essen- tially a prig, though men of his stamp have a danger- ous tendency in that direction as they increase in years, but injured vanity will assume that guise as well as manifold others. Henrietta had consoled her- self for the loss of him, and in rather a brilliant man- ner; and it was not in his nature to resist the tempta- tion of emphasizing for the benefit of others the flaws in her position. ( I must confess I am surprised that a woman whom I have always regarded as so delicate and high-toned could bring herself to marry a man as unrefined, in manner and appearance as hie undoubtedly is," Gra- hame replied. He said it with such an air of superior strength of virtue, of self-sacrificing faithfulness to honor and his ideal, that Harvey's blood thrilled through her veins with indignation and contempt. "At least he is a man, -he can love a woman and fight his enemy openly," she answered instantly; " if she does not love him, at any rate she can never de- spise him.- She has satisfied her hlead, if not her heart, and that is drawing the second prize in the lottery of life. I congratulate her tost sincerely." Her voice was markedlye'1  than usual, as it al- ways became when she was deeply stirred; but it was  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7732-00000136"/> 272        OPPORTUNITY. so vibrant, so surcharged with her inner feeling, that for a moment or two the whole party sat in rather uneasy silence. Grahame simply replied by that calm, ineffable bow of his by which he always contrived to throw the onus of bad taste and bad manners upon those who addressed him with uncomfortable truths or disturb- ing warmth. But this was mere outer covering, the success of long habit; internally he was sore, almost savage from the blow.' He had often tried to shiver the indifferent sweetness and calmness of her man- ner; he now had attained his purpose, but it scarcely brought the desired result or the old sensation. The rest of the party resumed their general conversation, and Harvey turned her head slightly from them to re- / gain her coolness. Doing so brought, Ridge's face close before her. He was sitting with his back to the others, appar- ently looking out at the sunset, but what she read in that countenance swept away all thought of herself or her transitory feeling. The story of the man's whole life lay bare before her. From some recess in 'her memory there sprang the recollection of having, in the old Bonbrobk days, heard Sophia say that Ridge Beckwith had been one of Henrietta's earliest and most complete victims.- That it was so she now saw for herself. To gaze at him was like watching a life: departing. She knew that in that fading sunlight there was fading away to him all the beautiful possi-   OPPORTUNITY.        273 bilities of existence which are every man's birthright, - the love which might be his and his alone, the sweet home-life, the children who might have played around his feet, keeping him ever young, - even the dream of these vanishing forever. Harvey's appreciation of the sensations of others was so morbidly acute that the sight of suffering was always to her refined torture, but in this case it was something far beyond the usual pain. She, too, had once known this feeling of dying while yet alive, though hers had been such mere blind, unanalyzed sensation. The sight before her called up that time so vividly, that, with memory and sympathy she wore almost the look she had borne when Hen- rietta left her before the fire on that midnight so long ago. The tea-long sounding its usual signal for breaking up, most of the party rose to obey it. Ridge turned mechanically, and met Harvey's eyes- before she had time to withdraw-them or to alter their expression. For a full moment they looked straight at each -other, and then the gentleman rose and walked away ., They had nearly all left when Douglas -came to Harvey's side. Her fire and earnestness had quite roused him from his slight depression. "If she- is thus warm and true to a woman, what would she not be to a man whom she really loved?" he thought, as lie looked down into the face which was now rather pale and weary. 12a             R  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7732-00000137"/> 274        OPPORTUNITY. With a gay little bow he offered his arm to escort her down stairs.. She took it with a tired, half-cling- ing gesture, so unlike her usual somewhat haughty composure that it was hard for Douglas not to put his arm about her instead, and draw her to the breast which he held to be her natural resting-place. Gt You are very faithful to your friends, Miss Ber- ney," he presently said, as they descended. "Yes," she answered, "I think my oath of allegi- ance is worth something." "Her oath of allegiance!" And he believed the day was fast approaching when she would swear itto him. He did not speak again until they parted. Later in the evening their little circle reunited, and by way of variety, went into the ball-room to amuse themselves after the fashion of other people. They found it somewhat dull' at first, but gradually a half- mad gayety took possession of them. They seemed to fancy themselves a crowd of wild school-children. Everybody was made to dance. Grahame; who had not deigned to " tread a measure " for many seasons, was ruthlessly claimed as a universal partner. Young ladies, to whom his famous waltzing was a tradition, resolved this night to dance with him or die in the at- tempt. Rose, to whom it was known to be unutter- ably distasteful, was caught and held in an unbroken chain of engagements. Har-ey, who was popularly supposed to hold such amusements rather in contempt, was mercilessly set upon. But here they found their   OPPORTUNITY.       275 mistake. If she seldom danced, it was simply because she found even pleasanter things to do. She was far too constitutionally musical for admirable time and tune not to affect both head and feet, for rhythm not to sway her, even physically. Excited by sudden reac- tion, she was soon leading the whole set.. Even Doug- las was dragged in, and by a series of skilful pushes and pulls manoeuvred through unfamiliar figures, to his own intense amusement and theirs also. The frolic was kept up until past midnight, and ceased at last from physical exhaustion. It was not until Douglas went up to his room and found Ridge sitting by the window smoking, that he remembered he had not seen him during the whole evening. "So you were not down stairs to see us all on ex- hibition," he said gayly. "No," Ridge answered quietly. Douglas threw himself on the bed, and, as the other said nothing, more, his thoughts went back, as they always did, to Harvey. The feeling of her clinging touch had never left his arm, and now seemed to fill his entire consciousness. He had lain there for per- haps half an hour, when Ridge suddenly spoke. "What do you say to going home?" "What!" cried oiut Douglas, " leave this delightful place! leave- " he stopped short.  .     - "Yes," answered Ridge, " that is just what I mean, - leave Harvey Berney. If you stay here you will love that woman, and you must not do it." A v  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7732-00000138"/> 276        OPPORTUNITY. "Why?" demanded the other. "Because, God help you! you have come too late." Douglas sat up and looked at him with a face few men would have cared to meet. "Take care how you say that, unless you absolutely know it," he said after a moment. "I read it in her face this afternoon." "Is that all?" cried Douglas, and he laid back al- most faint with his relief. "Why, I thought she must have told you she was engaged to some ione else." "Douglas," answered Ridge, with desperate ear- nestness, " ten years ago a woman gave me my death-blow. I saw in Harvey Berney's eyes that some man has done the same for her. We recog- nized each other as I think spirits may do on the other side of the grave." "Dear old boy!" said Douglas, speaking very ten- derly, but with all the quivering, torturing suspense- and agony gone from tone and manner," you know how I sorrow in any sorrow of yours; you ought not to have borne this grief so long alone. But, as far as I am concerned, I think your own experience and your love for me have influenced your imagination. What you supposed you saw in Harvey Berney must have been your own; shadow cast upon her. I should need the evidence of my senses to believe in its reality." "Well, well," replied Ridge, wearily, "I have done   OPPORTUNITY.        2" what I could to warn you. I suppose you must blind- , ly fulfil your destiny, as we all do; but I had hoped ;for happiness for you." "And you shall see it," returned Douglas, eagerly, as though he would not and could not face any other fate. They were both silent after that; but Douglas lay pondering upon the strange inequalities in the dis- pensations of Providence. "Why should the same Hand mete out to Ridge defeat and hopeless disap- pointment, and yet grant to me, far less worthy, a present and future so glorious with life and love?" and when at last he fell asleep, it was with humble prayer and thanksgiving at his heart. ,     ,  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7732-00000139"/> 278        OPPORTUNITY. CHAPTER XIX. A S these long bright days passed, a cloud began at times to fall upon Harvey. It was so faint that she herself was scarcely conscious of it. Yet it was- sure to gather about her after some look or action from Douglas in which his heart, his whole nature, found momentary speech. She mentally put them aside now as hitherto, believing as firmly as ever in his engagement with Rose; still they affected her to a degree that filled her with vague, not untroubled wonder. She did not analyze her sensation; but a dim consciousness of response which seemed to rise from some unknown depth of her nature, a sense of- being swayed from equipoise by some large force as strong and pure as sunlight, would come over her with a power she could not comprehend. - That recognition which had flashed upon Douglas was beginning in a ffaint, crude manner to make itself felt rather than seen by her. The emotional nature, stunned, almost dead- ened, by that early shock, was struggling back to life; the heart was at last stirring in its sleep, if not awaken- ing from its long trance. The jar upon her happy, hopeless tranquillity brought with it a strange pain, an inarticulate aching which settled round'her heart with- out its meaning reaching-her brain.   OPPORTUNITY.        279 At last there came to her a perception of why he so influenced her. The band was playing after tea in the little grove in front of the hotel, and she and Douglas sat under the trees listening to the pleasant music and watching the young moon rise. She had left the house in rather a merry mood; but gradually it wa's Douglas who talked, and she sat looking at him with a questioning intentness in her eyes, thinking far more of him than of what he was saying. The words were of little consequence; but his manner, with his entire being, softened and deepened as it always did when they were together. "A man I might have loved!" burst upon her like a revelation. "A man to whom I could have given my heart, if he had come while I still had a heart!" Wrong, Harvey Berney, wrong! A man whom you could love now, if he is as resolute as he is strong, as determined as he is daring; if, like Ja- cob, he will wrestle with the angel of life for his blessing. 9 The change in her face startled Douglas. ("What is it?" he asked hurriedly, and he put out his arm with all a lover's instinct of tender protection. "You look as though some great terror had suddenly come upon you."' "No," she answered slowly, "only a great de- spair." He gazed at her in troubled astonishment, but be-  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7732-00000140"/> 280        OPPORTUNITY. fore he rhad recovered sufficiently to make any reply, Grahame came up to say that the whjle party was going down upon the beach, and the three walked back to the house. By his usual adroit social tactics, Grahame soon se- cured Harvey as his share of the evening's entertain- ment; giving Rose, at the same time, into Douglas's care. Having little apparent fresh food, his definite jealousy of his brother had died out; and he began to accept the popular belief concerning Douglas's devotion to his cousin. But though Harvey walked slowly at Grahame's side for hours through the cool night air, she seemed strangely far away from him. Her fashion of croon- ing had never left her, was still the half-unconscious utterance for many emotions and sensations too shad- owy  for words. Many nights, as they had strolled upon the beach, the only sound, except the rhyth- mic fall and rush of the waves, was her low, soft singing of some wordless air. As it had hitherto ex- pressed but the overflow of a sweet, indolent enjoy- ment, there were few of her ways or moods which Grahame found so enchanting. But this night, in- stead of soothing his nerves like a magic charm, the sound of her voice and the strain she murmured over and over made them quiver to actual suffering.  In- stead of welling up from a dreamy half-sensuous de- light, and evoking the same sensation in him, it seemed now almost the moan of weariness, pain, and unrest, 5?   OPPORTUNITY;        281 and to call back to him all the- corresponding memories of his own heart. "Stop!" he cried at last. ' Excuse me, but I can bear this no longer. I feel as though you were invoking some spell upon us both, in singing that lhorrible tune." "Why, it is Taubert's Berceuse," she answered, though it was a second before-she recalled what it was she had been using almost involuntarily for expression. And then she looked at him with some surprise and reawakened interest. So he too had recognized the subtile pain, the longing and passion hidden under- that smooth strain,-- he too had tasted the bitter through the seeming sweetness. "A berceuse!" he exclaimed; " why, to sing that over any child in its cradle would be, to me, calling down a curse upon it! I should believe that in after days he would sing it for himself with a terrible com- prehension of its real meaning," and he almost shiv- ered as he spoke. "Do try something else, and take this chill out of bone and marrow." But Harvey said she was tired, and neither sang nor -crooned again that evening. To Douglas the time passed wearily and ,a rily. Not only was it that her words and look had given him a sense, of trouble and insecurity, but the entire separation which Grahame had effected reacted upon itself, and made him feel that this state of things could not long continue. lHis happiness should not lie at  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7732-00000141"/> 282     '   OPPORTUNITY. the mercy of outside circumstances and personal ca- price. He determined to claim his own, and that speedily. The whole party were habitually thrown together so familiarly that they two were seldom, if ever, alone. But he knew that now that the young moon was beginning to shed a faint light upon the beach, they were sure to be upon it during part of every evening. There they would be alone in a crowd at the worst, or, strolling away, would be lost in the semi-darkness, and there he resolved to win or lose that which was to his life as the soul is to the body. Consequently, the next night he took his place at her side, and held it by passive resistance, by apparent unconsciousness of any one else's presence. Grahame, finding that his smooth manoeuvres fell to the ground, declined with equal outward courtesy and inward irri- tation to be of the company, and went off with Ridge to smoke. The influence of the evening before had quite passed away from Harvey; she had settled back into her ac- ceptance of life as it came to her, returned to her un- conscious system of making small pleasures cheer her existence in lieu of the warmth and light of a great central happiness. The night was unusually clear and bright, and the salt air from the ocean refresh- ing, even stimulating. Being in a receptive mood, Harvey made the most of these small blessings, and was glad and gay, entertaining and amusing them all. Douglas found no chance to separate himself   OPPORTUNITY.       283 and his companion from the group,  w  as held together, not only by Harvey, but by the common in- terest in a subject under discussion. Another letter had been received, giving the particulars of Hen- rietta Dangerfield's marriage, and again the popular opinion upon the match was revived and expressed with fresh force. "I am sure it was his title which tempted her, more even than liis molney or position," laughed one of the ladies. "That' Hon.' the American female mind finds it impossible to resist." ",Henrietta especially," answered some one; "she always looks as though Providence hada done her an injury in not- making her a duchess." "Or an empress, for that matter," returned the first speaker. "' I believe the chief attraction of heaven to her is, that she hopes to wear a crown there; and even that would not satisfy her unless some high- sounding name, some archangelic title, went with it." And then they went off into desultory talk upon titles in general, and which each would select were a choice granted them. The young moon was by this time setting, and most of the people were going back to the hotels. As the conversation was growing commonplace, and they were at a long distance from the house, Harvey pro- posed to turn their steps in its direction. In doing so, Douglas contrived that they two should fall some 'is- tance behind the others, and move on more slowly.  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7732-00000142"/> 284        OPPORTUNITY. She had noticed that lhe had been very grave all the evening, so she was not surprised that he was now silent. His quiet moods were always pleasant to her, as toning most perfectly with her own. But as the stillness continued, she became vaguely conscious that he was scarcely his ordinary self. She could not see that he was curiously pale, and that his eyes were bright with an eager light; but she could not help perceiving an indefinable agitation which pervaded the whole man. "Something must have happened to annoy him, probably something in connection with Rose," she thought, and refrained from any apparent notice of his manner. Had she not put aside the idea of his loving her as utterly impossible, she probably would have drawn another and truer deduction from the slight evidence; or, indeed, had she loved him, her own nervous sensitiveness would have translated to her the real meaning of his. But she did not con- sciously love him ; it was only that he might yet comrn. pel her to do so by the power of his own passion. With the heart, as with the soul that has tasted death, if a saviour, a regenerator come, it will always be that t" we love him because he first loved us." As to Douglas, he was awaking to fresh knowledge of himself; he was discovering that he had overval- ued his own strength, and underrated the trial to which he was putting it. He had imagined that nothing could be more natural, even involuntary, than to speak the love which was always rising from   OPPORTUNITY.        285 heart to lips; that he had but to take his stropg grasp from his passionate emotional nature, and it would lavish itself before her. But now that it came to him to put his meaning into definite words and sentences, now that he must ask, and she must answer, his cour- agoe suddenly deserted him, he grew faint-hearted. "While we were talking of titles just now," he said at last, "I was thinking there was but one I had ever heard whose possession I envied, -' O Dan- iel, man greatly beloved!' " Harvey looked up and smiled, thinking how char- acteristic was his' choice, and how fully it had been granted him, but made no audible reply. He had meant to ask her whether he bore that title to her; he had intended to go on and tell her what she was to him, and demand love for love. But he could get no further than that single sentence; his very powers of speech failed him. Was the slight vein of weakness in this man to con- trol him now? Were the few drops of feeble mother- blood to rule his whole nature at the critical moment in his existence? Was the influence of that dead wo- man in her grave to mar his life, as she had ruined that of her eldest son? Was the brotherhood of these two men, denied so long in heart, to avenge itself by appearing with abnormal closeness in their defeat, still worse in their failure? It seemed even so; for moment after moment passed, and still Douglas walked on silent and powerless.

I think it is some quarter of an hour which, for most of us, decides the battle of life. They were very near the hotel by this time, and Douglas knew that his opportunity for that night was gone. "However," he thought, " it could be but the dif- ference of a few hours. -He would get over this hor- rible nervousness, and next time he would not be baf- fled by any force, external or internal. The following day should yield him some chance, and then lie would speak out, let come what would." In appearance, it was a slight thing. In reality, it was the choosing of the wrong path where the roads of life met. As they stepped upon the lighted porch, Douglas looked back with a strange regretful pang into the shadowy darkness from which they had come. But he did not know that he had left behind him all his hopes and dreams, all which he had longed after and lived for in these summer days; that the decisive hour, the test-moment of his life had come - and gone.   OPPORTUNITY.        28 CHAPTER    XX. EXCEPT a passing salutation, they chanced to see -nothing of each other during the next day until dinner-time. After that meal, some one Ipoposed they should all start on an expedition to one of the farthest points on the island. The place was of slight interest, but the drive would be pleasant, and they could return later by the beach. As the road was very rough, private vehicles were voted out of the question; and it was determined they should all go in the light open stages, so much more social and suitable for a large, gay party. Everybody entered cheerily into the little project. Even Mrs. Olmstead smiled graciously, and conde- scended to accompany them. Grahame received the plan with unusual spirit; but having secured the rear seat for Harvey, and settled himself beside her, he seemed to feel his share in arranging matters quite over. As they rode rapidly one, the talk and laughter both in the vehicles and between them was both gay and loud. Presently, under cover of the sound, Grahame said to Harvey, speaking with a slight nervous hesita- tion -  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7732-00000144"/> 288        OPPORTUNITY. Do you remember that berceuse you were sing- ing the other evening? It haunted me so last night that I tried to get rid of it by putting illto words what it seems to me to say." And he handed her a paper upon which verses were evidently written. Her interest and curiosity were both sufficiently aroused to induce her to read it instantly, as he had not intended her to do. But two or three persons claiming her attention at the moment, she slipped it into her pocket to be opened at the first convenient season. They reached their destination, refreshed them- selves with fruit and ices, and were returning by way of the beach before any such opportunity occurred. The winter before, a vessel had been cast ashore upon this coast, and its hull now lay half buried in the sand. As soon as they saw it, nothing would satisfy the young ladies but going on board, for the pleasure of saying that they had been upon a wreck. "-It would sound so exciting," as one of them ex- plained, as they were all springing out of their car- riages, and scrambling with much assistance up the side of the brig. As soon as one went, no one would be left behind; so presently they were all sitting upon the deck, in delight at the novelty of their situation. It was Douglas's hand Harvey had taken to aid her descent from the carriage; it was he who had helped her over the vessel's side, and he who now sat next her. In the hasty, irregular grouping they were   OPPORTUNITY.          289 somewhat cut off from  the rest; and their neighbors on the other hand were flirting too busily to notice them.              I Hungry for some communication with her beyond the smile and bow with which she had thanked him for his assistance, Douglas would have eagerly seized the chance to talk even on general subjects; but Har- vey had bethought herself of the verses in her pocket, had taken them  out, and was reading them.   So he simply sat and watched her (as also did Grahame who was stranded upon the opposite side), happily enough at first; but with feelings which swiftly corresponded to the change in her face, to the darkening, deepening shadow which grew over it as she read. The verses had no superscription, and read thus,--taking form from the quaint air they translated:-- Low as the murmuring night-wind, At thy window I call, Waiting in vain for the light of thine eyes, Watching in vain for my star to arise, Listening in vain for thy soft reply, Longing in vain to give, sigh for sigh,- All in vain Save for pain, At thy window I call. Heart which my heart is now claiming, Will not its throbbing awake 7 Eyes that have softened beneath my gaze, Cheeks that have flushed at my murmured praise, Lips that were sacred to me alone, 13                s  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7732-00000145"/> 290         OPPORTUNITY. Hand that has trembled within mine own, Why now all cold? Think, as of old, 'Neath thy window I call. Hast thou no rath nor remembrance? Think what thou 'rt leaving to die! Truth that would see neither faults nor fears, Hope that would make but a rainbow of tears; Faith that could trust through the dark unknown, Love that would measure thy depth by its own,-- All to be lost? Count but the cost! As at thy window I call. She understood human nature too well to be sur- prised that a man of Grahame's temperament should have a weak facility for rhyme, of which in extreme youth he would be somewhat proud, and in riper years somewhat ashamed.   She well knew that this was not poetry, even in a crude, careless form; that it was simply that versification of intense emotion which almost any one can produce in the heat and exaltation of passion and pain. Yet' it stirred her to the heart. It brought back to her very sight the past and the shadows that peopled' it; those days when, if he had been man enough to speak out one tithe of the devo- tion and earnestness which he here expended freely, all might have been very different.    It was so like him to put into lines with neat musical endings a suf- fering which, when it had come to her, she had en- dured in dumb agony; it was still more like him to   OPPORTUNITY.        2991 impose upon himself as to the degree and truth of his feelings, then and now, and to expect her to accept a second time the half-fiction for reality. That she had loved the creation of her own imagination she had long known, but how utterly dead even that was she had never comprehended as now. Yet upon this she had wasted her heart. As she gazed over those level sands, they seemed to her no more bare and arid than her life, past and to come. And Douglas sat silently watching her face. The accommodations were primitive to a degree which rendered it difficult to make some of the party comfortable. Mrs. Olmstead, in particular, was not, for the first five minutes, still or satisfied for a second; and kept the gentlemen arranging shawls as cushions, until their patience giving way, they all deserted her; ex- cept one of Rose's admirers, who, having reasons of his own for propitiating her, stood to the work until she was content with her position. "Upon my word, Tom, your devotion to old age is truly edifying," laughed one of the young men rather- maliciously, as he came over to them. - "My dear fellow," he answered quite candidly, "I love that lady with an A -because she is an aunt!" "And you love the niece with an A also, because she is an heiress," the other returned with a sublime disregard of orthography. (' What is that?" asked several voices, halt catching the words and laughter without the connection.

The game was chiefly confined to those in the inner circle. Harvey and Douglas and a half-dozen out- siders had not been appealed to. But presently the girl next her announced with unwonted truth that she loved her love with an M, because he was mustached. "And now, Miss Berney, you haven't told us any- thing. Why do you love your love with an M?" "Because it is a memory," was the involuntary half- whisper which fell from Harvey's lips. "Apparently Miss Berney does not love her love at all," the young lady laughed, as she seemed to wait in vain for an answer; and the play went merrily on. Douglas alone had seen and heard. He sat per- fectly still for a moment or two; and then, rising, swung himself over the side of the vessel, and was lost among the carriages. No one noticed his absence until they were retur 'g home, when they naturally supposed he had preceqd them. In reality he was walking swiftly up the beach, hurrying from them as though for life. Too late! That was all, but the consciousness of it filled soul and body. From heart and brain and writhing lips came the burden of but that one expression. A horrible raging agony, a mad despair, possessed and tore him like a demon. Past and future vanished; before and   OPPORTUNITY.        293 after him black night seemed to rush down and enclose him face to face with one fact. Hour after hour he pwent on, in deadly conflict with this formless foe, until the darkness gathered and settled upon the face of the earth, and the stars shone in the heavens above him. Then the demon seemed to rest, if not to come out of him; and he sank down upon the beach with but one longing desire,--to go out of existence- then and there. It was near the turn of .the t{ie, and it soon began to rise and flow in. He could hear it coming closer and closer with a monotonous sway-which lulled his worn nature.. Why not lie still and let the cool waves pass over him and quench this " fitful fever "? why not end this living death by actual dying?  He had but to remain passive, and rest and oblivion would come. It is curious how, when reason, will, and con- science have all been overcome, lie dead or tranced, some instinct, some peculiarity of temperament, will still retain its vitality, still have power to control us. It was this Anglo-Saxon nature's vague disgust at dy- ing like the hero of a French novel which brought him to his feet; it-was his constitutional horror of inspection and discussion which sent him home at last before curiosity or comment arose. He entered the hotel, and reached the second story unobserved. But to gain his apartment he had to come out on the porch, and by the door sat a little figure which had held its place since twilight. Here,  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7732-00000147"/> 294        OPPORTUNITY. with undefinable fear, Rose had waited and watched but to see him come back, intending then to slip silently away. But as he passed under the liall light she saw his face, with its haggard, sharpened outline as of wasting illness, with its starved, craving, dying look in the eyes, and knew instantly what must have happened, what single blow could have wrought such transformation. In another second, as he crossed the threshold, she was at his side with both hands ex.. tended, with the sweet, low voice saying to him, - "Douglas, I love you!" "Rose, little Rose," he cried out in his bitter agony, t" in all my life only you and the old father!" He sat down upon the seat she had left, and, grasp- ing the small hands like a drowning man, laid his throbbing, fevered forehead upon them. Thus side by side, in their equally helpless pain and pity, they remained as the moments fleeted over them. At last the sound of passing footsteps made Rose try to disengage her hands and rouse him to outward appearances. But he only held them more tightly. "I cannot let you go,--I cannot," he muttered. i You are all I have now; if you loosen your hold, I shall go down to destruction." And the girl silently yielded. "You must go home and rest," she said presently; "go back to Bonbrook until your life and the world become endurable to you." "Rose," he answered, suddenly lifting his head,   OPPORTUNITY.        295 and speaking with the desperate instinct of self-pres- ervation, " if I ,go there, you too will have to come. If I stay there alone, I shall go mad; and if I go out into the world, it will be from bad to worse. You can save me from myself, and I demand that you do it." Then Rose Carvel learned that " perfect love casteth out fear.' Without doubt or dread she took this man's future in her feeble little hands; not in her own strength, but through the might of the utter faith and devotion within her. He needed her, and that was all-sufficient. At any moment of her life she would have died for him; and now that he had asked her to live for him, she would no more fail him. She would have served him like a slave upon her knees, and he had called her to be the stay and succor of his soul. "I love you, Douglas," she simply repeated, as though that answered all questions, made all things plain and right and possible. The man only laid his head again upon the hands, and the compact which united their lives was settled. It was a strange betrothal. No love-kiss sealed it, no sweet tears or tender inward rapture hallowed it, no dreams and hopes too dear for words filled that silence; absolute truthfulness alone justified and sanc- tified this affiancement. Even when they parted, there was small sign of their relation to each other, except Douglas's weary voice saying, as he told her he should leave this place in the early morning, -  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7732-00000148"/> 296        OPPORTUNITY. "Rose, have mercy.  Come to me soon, very soon. When Ridge came up to his room that night, he found Douglas hastily gathering his clothes into his trunk. He glanced at his occupation and then at his face, and gave a half-groan. ' I shall go back to Bonbrook to-morrow morning," the other briefly explained. "Then I shall go as far as Baltimore with you," Ridge answered, thinking it would cover suspicion of the cause if they left together. "And Ridge," said Douglas, standing before him :; and looking him steadily in the face with a manner which left no room for comment, "I am  going to marry Rose Carvel in a month." Ridge looked at him in silence, and then turned away; and no further explanation ever passed be- tween them.   OPPORTUNITY.       297 CHAPTER    XXI. AS Harvey and Grahame were leaving the break- fast-room the next morning, he said carelessly:-- "I wonder what whim took Douglas and Ridge back to Baltimore so suddenly. I was so surprised and sleepy when they came to bid me good by that I hardly knew what either of us was saying." "Gone! Have they gone?" exclaimed Harvey, a curious blankness growing in the large, uplifted eyes. "Yes; but I thought you had received full explana- tions and farewells." "Nod" she replied; and after that made slight an- swer to his somewhat unusual flow of conversation while he remained at her side. Beyond a weariness in mind and body, she was conscious of no definite sensation; and yet in a single moment life seemed strangely to, have altered. An indefinable feeling of loss as of the vanishing of some- thing which yet had never been, as of the fading-away of a light that had no source, crept over her souls wrapped it in faint shadow. He had no place in lier life, nor she in his; and yet his absence left a loneli- ness in those recesses of her being which his look and word had often stirred to renewed existence.

That day Rose told Mrs. Olmstead, in just her usual quiet way, that she was engaged to Douglas Ferguson, and had promised to marry him immediately.  The lady received the communication most graciously. After her fashion she really loved the girl, and was gratified at her supposed happiness. She was some- what scandalized at the gentleman's absence; but he had impressed her, as he did most persons, with his natural right to follow his own will, even his ow'n whim. Rose explained his disappearance and desire for the quietest possible marriage as arising from a horror of being on exhibition; and Mrs. Olmstead willingly accepted the excuse. According to her code there were few faults, much less peculiarities, which might not be forgiven such an unexceptionable parti as Douglas Ferguson.  She readily acquiesced in Rose's wish to return to town the next morning, and that nothing should be said as to the cause of their going. Indeed, she made but one stipulation in the whole matter, and that concerned whlat she sincerely regarded as one of its most important items. - "I cannot have you married like a servant, my dear. You must have time for proper preparations, for procuring a suitable trousseau. Mr. Ferguson must wait for that, and then his wedding may be as   OPPORTUNITY.        299 quiet as he chooses," and upon this they compro- mised. It was evening before Mrs. Olmstead announced her intended departure. She came into the ball-room to bid them all adieu overnight, as they would be still asleep at the hour for leaving. Rose came with her. The girl had so sedulously avoided Harvey, that they now met for the first time since their ride of the pre- vious afternoon. As usual, Harvey looked curiously and intently into the other's face, trying to read the secret thoughts and feelings it covered; yet, as usual, she was baffled. Still, she was conscious of a change in it. No happier, no brighter; but that self-restrained, held look it had borne through these later days was gone, and in its place the eyes had an absorbed, self- forgetful ,expression, as of some concentrated inner thought and purpose. Her farewell would have been confined to a little bow which comprehended the whole party, had not Harvey said,- "Rose, I am sorry we must part, and so suddenly. But we will meet again." The girl flushed slightly, but said not a word; and, giving her but an added bow of assent and adieu, went her way. This unexpected departure saddened and depressed Harvey still further. "Mamma," she said presently, "I think we had better go also. The season is nearly over, and it will  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7732-00000150"/> 300        OPPORTUNITY. soon be cold and uncomfortable here. Suppose we take to-morrow to arrange matters, and leave the next day? "Certainly, my child, if you wish it," was Mrs. Berney's gentle reply. "I think you are quite right. I too shall not stay any longer," said Grahame, speaking as though his determination, formed the moment before, arose from a mature and impartial examination of the circum- stances. "Take to-morrow to arrange matters," - the phrase haunted Grahame that night, for it was what he had resolved to attempt. Before this pleasant, familiar phase of life ended, he would make one bold, honest effort to secure that for which he so hungered and thirsted, let the result be what it might. If he were destined to go down, he would go down bravely; this time, at least, he would not carry away the subtile tor- ture of knowing that the failure had been in himself. This summer's intercourse with Harvey had elevated him thus far, that he would now stand'immeasurably higher in his own eyes coming out from a lost battle in which he had struck manfully and well, than if he shirked the trial in cowardly fear of possible defeat. It could hardly be said that he expected success; though a, desperate, craving hope possessed him at moments that all would yet go well, a wild ecstatic bliss throbbed through his heart at what might possi- bly be awaiting him.     t   : OPPORTUNITY.       301 As Douglas had done, he trusted to the quiet even- ing hour upon the beach for a chance to speak. But when night came the sky was deeply overcast, and a storm evidently approaching. The wind had risen, and was rolling in the breakers high and heavily. Round the horizon were piled masses of black cloud, through which distant, noiseless lightning darted in swift, fiery lines, or shimmered and shivered in broad, fitful glare. The moon was so veiled that her dim light but served to make the darkness visibly. To  wander far from the hotel was impossible. Grahame began to fear circumstances would defeat his purpose. They were strolling about the porches and ball-room, idly gazing at the dancers, when there occurred to him a way in which he could gain the stillness and solitude he sought. "Suppose we go out to the pavilion," he said qui- etly to Harvey. "It will be much pleasanter there than in this noisy, brightly lighted room, and we can watch the coming storm at sea." She readily assented, and they slipped away unno- ticed across the lawn to the summer-house upon its verge, almost overhanging the beach below. Seated there, with the salt wind blowing full upon her slightly flushed cheeks, with the low-lying clouds and their ever-changing electrical effects to look upon, Harvey cared but little to talk. This still darkness, broken only by the sound of the waves, rested mind and body, calmned the nerves which had borne more than one unwonted jar during the last day or two. \  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7732-00000151"/> 302        OPPORTUNITY. But presently Grahame, who had come hither with a fixed -intention, broke the silence. "It is hard," he said, " that our last evening should have the shadow of gloomy weather on it; that these sunny days and glorious nights should end thus." "Yes," she returned, rather sadly, " but they are past and gone, and will soon seem as though they had never been." "Not to me, not to me," he exclaimed eagerly, "though I fear it will be so with you, as it has been before. I sometimes wonder. if you ever remember." "On the contrary, I never forget," she replied gravely. "Then, Harvey Berney,'" he said, rising suddenly, and standing before her with a large dignity of simple directness very new in him, "I ask you to remember the old days when we first met, and to acknowledge that I loved you then as I love you now." By the dim light he could see the figure stir for a second, and then it was as motionless as the lips were silent. The sickening suspense with which he waited through the moments that followed seemed to lengthen them to infinitude. "Have you nothing to say to me, not even an an- swer to give me in return?" he cried out, unable longer to endure it. "Yes, I have this to tell you," and across the voice fell the ghostly shade of the now dead agony and bit-   OPPORTUNITY.       303 terness, which had filled with dreadful vitality that long-gone time. "In those old days I loved you, - now I like you. In me the Scripture has been ful- filled, -' I have known the truth, and the truth has made me free!" As she finished, she also rose, as thoughqphysically reiterating her spiritual liberty and self-sovereignty. At the first words he had come towards her with an impulse of almost delirious joy and love, but he stepped back powerless and dumb. Had there been anger, exaggeration, or living pain in her tone and sentence, he might have found strength to plead and protest against it; but its moderation, its absolute verity, crushed him. He had required his answer, and he knew that he had received it. Without another word, Harvey left the pavilion and walked across the lawn, he moving at her side equally silent./ But just before they reached thelmhouse she hesitated, stopped, and put out her hand.  "This--this mistake can make no change in my friendship," she said, her tone low and quivering, "and it must make none in yours." "You. are' asking much, more than you compre- hend," he returned, his voice scarcely under his control. "But you will grant it?" she pleaded.  As far as is possible for me." For a moment he held the hand that was never to be his. Then they sadly took their differing paths, as they would through the rest of their lives.  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7732-00000152"/> 304        OPPORTUNITY. CHAPTER     XXII. THE arrangements for Rose's wedding Mrs. Olm- stead had taken into her own hands; appointing the beginning of November as the earliest date at which she could allow it to take place. That time had now arrived. What the interval had been to Douglas, no one but himself ever knew. Never in all his life did he allude to it. Having once existed through it, he did not dare to return to it even in thought. As for Grahame, the days wore themselves away for him very much as they had always done; except that his ennui was now utterly hopeless, except that his old sense of self-abasement was now his most constant mood. But his spiritual humiliation no longer purified and strengthened him; the bitter had lost its efficacy, had become unwholesome self-contempt and distrust. Since the night in the pavilion he had, as it were, given himself up.  He had then made one great effort to save himself; and, that failing, ihad since simpily drifted whither the current of nature and circum- stances might carry binim. Not only did he lack the care to resist, but he really did not seem to himself worth the trouble of a  struggle. If he gravitated downward, lie might as well fulfil his natural destiny, - and that as speedily as possible.   OPPORTUNITY.       305 Harvey lived through these autumn hours of falling leaf and sighing wind with an unwonted pervading consciousness that " the melancholy days had indeed come, the saddest of the year." Rose, self-forgetting, striving but for the good of another, taking no thought for her own happiness, alone found it. Had pride, suspicion, or even self-conscious- ness tainted her self-abnegation, they would have dis- covered all-sufficient food in Douglas's absence and silence. But that heart held no- room for aught but its pity, its faith, and its love. Even now she was realiz- ing that " whosoever loseth his life shall find it." The single-mindedness of one emotion and one purpose made the path plain before her, and rendered her strong to walk it. The marriage was to take place in the middle of the week which was now the beginning. Douglas had come to town that day, and taken up his quarters, as usual, with Ridge. That he should look ill and haggard had been too sadly foreboded by the other for him to feel or express surprise. at his aspect. But Grahame had no such forewarning, and was really shocked at the alteration in his brother's appearance, when he dropped in to greet him that evening on his way to a party. "Why, Di, what is the matter? Have you been ill?" he exclaimer. "I have not been very well," answered the other, quietly. i; By the way, Grahame, to whose house are / *T  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7732-00000153"/> -306       OPPORTUNITY. you going to-night?" he asked abruptly, to change the course of the conversation. Grahame gave in reply the name of an old friend of the family. "It is the first large gathering of the season, and something worth seeing. Every one will be there; among others, your friend Harvey IBerney, whom I suppose you have not quite forgotten," he added ner- vrously, giving his own true reason for going, little dreaming what that name and presence were to the man whom   he addressed. His self-consciousness was such that he did not look at any one as he spoke, and thus missed seeing the change which came into Douglas's face. When he did glance towards him, that face was turned away, and so  remained for the next five minutes, during which Grahame and Ridge had the conversation to them- selves. Presently the visitor rose to keep his engage- ment. "Grahame," said Douglas suddenly, rising  also, with a strange light in his eyes, "(I think I will go' with you, if{you will take me. The lady has always seemed glad to see me, and I should like one more glimpse of the world before I renounce its pomps and vanities," he added, with a harsh, discordant laugh. "Very well," replied  Grahame;  and the other went off for a few minutes to change his dress. To any one else he would have suggested that. the - proceeding was, under the circumstances, scarcely an   OPPORTUNITY.        307 ordinary one ; but few persons had the nerve to preach propriety to Douglas Ferguson, least of all his brother. The temptation had been simply too great. Before the wild tumult which the possibility of seeing her' once more had raised, resolutions, restraints, conven- tionalities, went down as reeds snap before a storm. The delay of Grahame's visit had made them quite late, and the rooms were full when they entered.  But even in that crowd, Douglas, towering above them all, singled her out, and made his way towards her in- stantly, Grahame following. "Mr. Ferguson!" she exclaimed, as she saw who stood before her; and the pleasure and surprise spoke out, not only in the thrill in her -voice, the kindling of the eyes, and the flushing of the pale cheeks, but in the two eager hands which she unconsciously put out to:- welcome him. The man said not a word. "Let me die now, before this moment passes; let me die here at her feet," Mwas his one conscious desire. Then she put .her manner into words, and said how glad she was to see him, making some pleasant allusion to their summer companionship. Still he did not at- tempt to speak, simply bowing his reply. Passing to her side, he leaned upon the end of the mantel-piece (before which she was standing) slightly in her rear, but still so close that, when she turned to address him, he could look straight down into the uplifted face. She did so but occasionally, for his manner and ap- pearance had both disturbed her. -Not only was she-  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7732-00000154"/> 808        OPPORTUNITY. alarmed at the physical change in him, but the expres- sion in his face, the)craving, devouring look in his eves as they fastened upon her, rendered her nervous and troubled; still more, brought back the old -responsive stir at hler heart. Grahame's greeting, though restrained, had been the customary audible one, and therefore easy to re- turn. They had met but once or twice, and that in general society, since their parting at Cape May; but upon each of these occasions, as upon the present, Harvey had by her manner reiterated her declaration that the events of that leave-taking should make no dif- ference in their friendship. Consequently, not only to cover the strange nervous discomposure with which Douglas had filled her, but with another definite pur- pose, she now turned to Grahame with unwonted cor- diality. As usual, he yielded involuntarily to her in- fluence, and, with those who had been standing with her before his approach, carried on for the next half- hour the gay, careless conversation suitable to the oc- casion; during all of which Douglas held his peace, speaking but once or twice when directly appealed to by Harvey.  Somewhat naturally, they were discussing the ap- pearance of those who were moving before them. Presently a lady passed, remarkable for her beauty, but also for her devotion to the opposite sex. "'That is a very handsome girl," said one of the gentlemen; " but she is never cognizant of more than one personal pronoun, - he."   OPPORTUNITY.        8309 "I think most of us would have to confess to a pet pronoun, upon which we expended our chief devotion," laughed Harvey. "The difference lies in which one we choose; for instance, I am afraid mine would be 1Z" "And most of us would be obliged to say she," answered the gentleman merrily. "Mr. Ferguson," said Harvey, glancing gayly up at the face just above her, and supposing that, with his engagement so publicly known, he would instantly acknowledge the same choice as the previous speaker, "which pronoun have you singled out for your wor- ship?" "You," the lips more than the voice syllabled, and she alone saw and heard. If his thought had not in- voluntarily passed to verbal form, I think the look which went with it would have been sufficient answer. As Harvey slowly turned her- head, the room and everything in it seemed reeling before her eyes. He loved her; it was no longer possible to doubt it; and even at that moment a great thrill strangely like joy vibrated through her at the thought. But Rose, - his near marriage, - the man's truth and honor, - it was all a wild whirl of disjointed facts in which she vainly strove to discover connection, much less har- mony. Over the tumult within and her intense phyS- ical consciousness of the man so near her, she tried to make rational, appropriate answers to those around her; but the effort was scarcely successful.  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7732-00000155"/> 810        OPPORTUNITY. It was a moment before Douglas realized his own act, - that he had added the one lacking element, the final touch of the pain, confusion, and discord to his situation. He turned abruptly away, and hurriedly left her side, in sheer dread of what he mighit do next. His purpose was to leave the house and reach home as soon as possible. But passing through the crowded room was the work of time, and he found that without rudeness he could only move with the current and at its measured pace. As he did so, he became conscious that he was being pointed out and commented upon by the party behind him. "This is Grahame Ferguson's brother just in front of us,'" said one of the ladies in a tone she did not sup- pose he would catch. "Is it, indeed?" returned another, eagerly. "I heard he was to be married day after to-morrow to Rose Carvel, and I suppose, he has come up for the wedding; but it is singular that he should be here to- night away from her." "I think the most singular part is, that he could possibly see anything to fall in love with in that quiet, pale-faced girl," rejoined the first speaker. "My dear," said an unpleasant female voice, c; how can you call yourself a Christian woman, if you have not read your Bible sufficiently to learn from Solomon that ' money answereth all things '?" The speaker was a woman, consequently there was  nothing for Douglas to do but to pass helplessly on, with her poisoned arrow rankling in his heart.   OPPORTUNITY.       3" "So," pondered this proud, pure-handed gentleman, stung to the quick, " this is what the world will think, - that I am bought with Rose's fortune. My God!" he thought a second after, the idea flashing upon him for the first time, and annihilating all other considera- tions, " it is what Harvey Berneyg may think, now that I have tc4J T' or I love her, and' yet, in the teeth of my own assertion, am to marry another woman."  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7732-00000156"/> 812        OPPORTUNITY. CHAPTER    XXIII. THE next evening had come, and twilight was darkening into night, when Harvey sat half crouching over her parlor fire, too weary in body and soul for occupation, almost for thought. All through the day there had worn upon her the unsolvable ques- tions, the mystery and doubt, which the previous night had raised. Now, like a thick black cloud, there wrapped about her and weighed upon her an infinite sense of failure, not only in her own existence, for that could be borne, but entering and controlling even more fatally all the lives she had intimately known. Dr. Dan, Sophia, Grahame, Henrietta, herself, and now Douglas and Rose, for whom she had believed such a different portion secure, :- what were each and all but varied forms of life's utter imperfection, testi- monies to what has been and ever shall be. Baffled aim and vanished hope, unfulfilled desire, upward striving and struggling undermined by inner weak- ness, -are these the cup every child of Adam must drink, wshich neither prayer nor rotest can put away? Ah! never as the rich, sweet draught of which our youth dreamed comes the true elixir of life, if we more than taste its bright foam. Beyond and above her personal trouble and pain brooded the great uni- versal sorrow, casting its shadow upon her soul.   OPPORTUNITY.       813 Presently the door opened, and a hurried step at her side made her look listlessly up. Douglas Fergu- son was standing before her. Not only in the face, but in the whole figure and manner there was a wild passion which in another moment would pass into speech. She started to her feet, and held up her hand in warning, almost in command. "Like an honest gentleman," she cried out breath- lessly, using the first words which came to her to bring him jack to remembrance of himself. This man's faith- and love and devotion belonged to another woman, and must not be lavished before her. She could not let him flaw his honor in some temporary madness.  "It is because I am an honest gentleman, and de- termined you should know it, that I am here," he answered steadily, with a self-control as large and strong as his emotion. "I cannot have your love, but I will not have your contempt. All day long I have striven and fought with myself; but it is useless, and here I am to see you once more and tell you the truth." He stopped for a moment to gather up his self-com- mand and his faculties. He seemed to himself a man taking leave of life, and these, his last words, must convey their full meaning. "You know now how I love you, and that when I stand to-morrow at the altar with Rose Carvel, it "       ,  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7732-00000157"/> 3814      -OPPORTUNITY. will not be love that draws me thither; but I cannot let you think, as I find others do, that I am selling myself for gold. I am at least ' honest.' Rose knows all and accepts all. When I found at Cape May that I had made a terrible mistake in hoping you could ever love me, when I discovered you had no heart to give me, that I had come too late-" again he stopped; the strain upon his self-command was beyond human endurance. Gazing upon this agony of despair, an uncontrol- lable impulse swept over the woman, seized upon her, to stretch out her hands and cry to him, - "Douglas, your only mistake has been in not see- ing that my heart is not dead, but sleeping; that you could still teach me to love you, that we might yet be supremely happy." How mighty was the temptation would never be known except to Harvey Berney and her God; but its power culminated and passed before he found strength to speak again. No, he had voluntarily pledged his word and promise to another, and that pledge must be redeemed; he must bear his hard fate as best he might. She thought of the utter desola- tion which would descend on another woman's life, were she now to take from it what it had rightfully won. For herself it was the surrender of a future bliss, of a joy which would have come forth in the ful- ness of time, - to that other it would be annihilation of happiness mnow and forever. Broken heart on the   OPPORTUNITY.        315 woman's side, broken faith on the man's,-that price must not be paid for any earthly good. For his own sake she did not dare to grant his heart's desire; ah, yes! and the desire of her own. Better misery, fail- ure, and disappointment, than that they should will- ingly sink to false degeneracy. Swiftly but surely she had counted the cost, when, after a moment, the man's voice again broke the stillness. Al "From that night I should have gone down to de- struction if Rose had not put out her hand to me. I clung to it then, and my one chance for heaven and earth is to cling to it until I die. You women, who lead such quiet, sheltered lives, can never know or comprehend a man's terrible necessity for some sem- blance of hope and happiness. Rose takes me just as I am, and I pray, for her sake, that she may save menl - - "And I pray the same prayer for your sake, and I know that it will be answered," cried Harvey's quiv- ering voice, as the hot tears sprang to her eves. The man gazed straight into them.  "I shall remember that," he said in a different Me from that which he had been using. "I shall remember that, though we part now perhaps forever.   love is a love for life and death, for time and eternity, yet for this world we, die to each other from to-night. But, Harvey," he said, coming close to her, and speaking with a horrible breathlessness, as rS        r-"  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7732-00000158"/> 316        OPPORTUNITY. though soul and body were being torn asunder, "dy- ing men gain their own rights and privileges." He took that noble, tender face within his hands, and raised it for one last long look. But he could not, he would not go, taking with him only that. Suddenly thile strong arms were about her, holding her, straining her, to that madly throbbing heart, while upon lips and cheeks and brow fell long burning kisses, each one of which seemed to claim and seal her as his own. Sud- denly again she felt herself released, and after a mo- ment knew that he was gone. Then she sank down before the fire, heart-sick and desolate, knowing that she had surrendered forever the man who loved her and whom she might have loved. It was early morning when Rose and Douglas stood together- in the church from which they went out man and wife. If the bride was pale and quiet, it was but her customary aspect; if the bridegroom was strange- ly haggard and worn, the eyes that watched him were few and friendly, and gave Sympathy rather than crit- icism. Then straight home, and Rose's lifelong work- had begun. (    OPPORTUNITY.       317 CHAPTER XXIV. IT  seemed to Douglas Ferguson, i after life, that he lived through the dark and dreary days of this winter and through the mocking sunshine of the fol- lowing summer, in a dreadful dream. Mechanically he performed the ordinary duties of existence, attending to his property and the comfort of those dependent upon him with a sort of mathematical prqcision, but with a sense that life and soul had gone out of him. He was so innately a gentleman, that his- courtesy to all women was-intuitive and uncon- scious. Rose could complain of no outward lack of care and kindness; yet love less absolute than hers must have failed before her utter powerlessness to bring a gleam of light or happiness into the tired, hope- less eyes, to draw him for a moment from the one ab- sorbing thought and memory. Yet she had a resource possessing which no lov- ing woman could falter,--not a day of all those weary ones but (proved his great need of her. If he came in from those long tearing gallops (whose only limit was his hoise's strength, and which perhaps pre- served his physical health from complete failure), she had but to go to him, as he lay upon the sofa, and softly stroke the damp, disordered hair, and the horrible rest-  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7732-00000159"/> 3818       OPPORTUNITY. lessness would depart, leaving him as weak and passive as a child. If this mute DaVid could not dispel the dark mood, she had countless ways of telling him that while under its shadow he was still not alone, that there was yet one soul which walked with him through the deepest night. Thus they lived on until the return of the win- ter, Then there came a day when the darkness was lifted forever, leaving but its shadow, -a day when Douglas Ferguson leaned over the bedside, and looked upon his first-born. Rose watched him with hope and despair battling in her heart. .The face h'be had bent down bore, just its usual aspect of blark weariness. The moments passed, and still he did not raise it; still she waited to know whether her great trust had failed. Presently the helpless little creature gave a feeble cry, and Douglas quietly stooped lower, and lifted it in hist arms. In that moment he took it to his heart inward- ly and outwardly. Gazing upon it, his face changed as though by a miracle. Something that was all his own, something to love and live for, upon which he could lavish the force of his deep, passionate nature, which would give back an equal love, and satisfy this torturing heart-fiunger, had been vouchsafed him at last. The man seemed literally born again in his child's birth. Youth and hope, and all the possibilities of life, had come again to him in this form, which was himself, and yet not himself.   : OPPORTUNITY.          319 Then he turned and looked at the mother of his child, the woman' who had brought him this great gift, - and Rose lay back upon the pillows, and envied no created being.  From this hour existence not only regained its in- terest for Doyglas Ferguson, but acquired a wondrous charm. The duties connected with his estate became a labor in which he delighted, for his child would reap the benefit. Tile time which had almost killed him in his efforts to kill it was now filled with the one great occupation of watching and loving that tiny being, with hoping and planning and working for its present and future. There was scarcely a thought which a consciousness of it :did not vitalize, not an aim into which it did not enter. Those long rides, in which he had vainly striven to escape from himself and a haunting memory, had now   ceased. The attraction to his home was too sweet and strong and    ever fresh for him not to reckon the hours wasted which he spent away from it, as a lover regards those lost which hold him from the side of his love. It literally seemed to him the only child in the world; consequently, it was not strange that he quite forgot his daughter would require a name like an ordi- nary human being, wherewith to be known among her fellow-creatures. Three months after its birth the necessity occurred to him definitely for almost the first time. He had -come in late one afternoon, and found Rose sitting in  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7732-00000160"/> 320        OPPORTUNITY. the mellowed sunlighllt, softly hushing and singing her babe to sleep. Leaning against the mantel, he stood silently gazing at Nature's ever beautiful, ever sacred picture of the Mother and Child; thinking of the old masters who had spent their lives in reproducing it with loving art, and yet whose works fade away before the tender holiness of the living original. The infantile features were beginning to assume a decided form ; and as he looked he was more than ever impressed with the resembllance to Rose, that the small face was al- most a copy in miniature of the larger one. The likeness suggested the name most natural for it to bear. "I suppose," he said, smiling as he spoke, ' this is to be little Rose," For a moment the woman did not answer, and when she did so, still looked down upon the infant in her arms. "No," she quietly responded, "it is to be little Harvey." Douglas turned abruptly, and walked away to the window.        . ; For perhaps half an hour Roses low murmuring singing was the only sound which filled rather than broke the stillness. The twilight had begun to shade the room, when he came and leaned upon the back of her chair. His wedded wife though she was, she did not turn and try to read his eyes, to study the face  she saw so perfectly without seeing. -Presently he began touching the hair upon her forehead.

SEVEN   years passed after Douglas Ferguson's marriage,- seven years which left their varied records upon these hearts and lives. To Douglas existence flowed on like a stream, broadening and deepening day by day, but unchanged in its course or end. Another child came to him, a boy; bult though he was a man to whom, apart even from natural affection, his son and heir would be a very important personage, little Harvey held, as ever, the first place in his heart. It was to Grahame's life that time brought the most marked changes.  The summer after his brother's wedding, his vanity and self-abandonment, aided by circumstances, carried him to his legitimate conclusion. He drifted into a rich marriage with a woman for whom he had neither respect nor love. He had gone to the Virginia Springs in a state of self-weariness which was almost desperation; but, being there, old habit had resumed its sway, and he had undertaken the conquest of the belle' of the season. This was a gorgeous brunette from one of the Gulf States,--a woman whose beauty, youth, and great wealth served to cover her destitution of heart and brain. Grahame's success was only too perfect; for, led on by the small   OPPORTUNITY.        323 vanity of outrivalling her train of admirers, he one night addressed her, half in jest; but was instantly accepted, and found himself, to his great surprise, an engaged man. So placed, he had accepted the situa- tion; thinking in his heart that perhaps it suited him as well as anything else, that he was probably fit for nothing better, that at least it could not be much worse than his present state. Marrying soon after, he went South to live on her plantation; there spending his days in the companionship of a nature weaker and lower than his own, and wearing out heart and spirit in one long useless regret for a vanished past and lost future. Three children grew around him; and it was no small portion of his punishment that he saw the reproduction in body of his own weak beauty, sensu- alized by the grosser element of the mother's blood, and in mind of his own shallow intellect further en- feebled and narrowed. For himself, he grew rather gray and stout, and somewhat heavy in manner; still he was a handsome man, and some of the grace and elegance of yore yet hung about him; but the old self seldom reappeared except after dinner, when the wine had flowed freely. Grahame did not come down to drunkenness, but his life was chiefly spent in smoking, eating, and drinking, and a little lazy, desultory read- ing. But then,' as ever, the man's retribution and curse were that, while sinking lower and lower, he was conscious of his own declension; he retained his mem- ory and recognition of a higher life, his hopeless long- ing for it.  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7732-00000162"/> 324        OPPORTUNITY. In the spring of which I am writing, Grahame left the South, and brought his family to stay with Douglas' at the old homestead, while he superintended the building of a house upon the land he had sO long owned next his brother's estate, and upon which he liad now determined to settle. His ostensible reason was that the climate suited his health much better; but a truer cause was his intense desire for some change, if only in external tflings. As for Harvey Berney, she was Harvey Berney still, in every sense; matured, deepened, and devel- oped, but striving for the same aims, walking on to the same end. To her these years have been repeti- tions of those which immediately preceded them. As in them, friends and lovers have come and gone, pleasure and pain, cloud and sunshine; but through it all there has remained to her her work. To it she has been faithful, and has had her reward. Carlyle says of Voltaire, that through sickness, trouble, and irri- tations, "Whenever he could write, -ah, that compen- sated for all things!" It is always thus with the truly commissioned, divinely touched lips, however imperfect the speech or humblethe song. But this spring her health failed visibly, and doctors and friends advised change and relaxation. Consequently she determined to join a party which was to travel in Europe for the next two or three years. But first' it was necessary to go down to llonbrook to settle her mother under Dr. Dan's care, and to bid him good by. Thus were   OPPORTUNITY.        325 these divided lives and sundered natures once again brought near each other. It was through a chance visitor that the Fergusons heard of Harvey's presence at Bonbrook and her in- tention of leaving the country. They were all sitting at the dinner-table when the information was given, and a slight silence followed, only broken by Mrs. Grahame Ferguson's exclaiming: - "Ah, yes! I remember now,-- Miss Berney the authoress! I should like to see her. I have always wondered what such people look like. I suppose, of course, there would be ink on her fingers." Grahame made a half-desperate movement in his chair as he heard her, and then took steadily to- thy! wine; but no one replied, and the course, of the con- versation changed. It was curious to notice the effect of the intelligence upon both men.   All through that day the old weary depressed restlessness held Grahame in its torturing power, making itself visible in the fitful feverishness of appearance and manner.  Douglas's nature did not lose its- large, steady self-control; but a singular brightness had come into his eyes, an indefinable air of still, smothered excitement, as though his blood had been stirred and the beat of his heart quickened by the proximity and possibility of some great joy and bless- ing. But, feel what they might, it was in silence, little dreaming of any companionship in fate or feeling. Between Rose and Douglas neither word nor look  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7732-00000163"/> 326        OPPORTUNITY. passed. But now, as always, she read the heart of the man with love's own intuition, and answered its needs with love's divine self-abnegation. Coming down the hall the next morning, he met her with her bonnet on, and then noticed that the carriage was at the door.                , "Why, Rose," he exclaimed pleasantly, " where are you going?" "I am going to Bonbrook," she answered gently, and her voice had just its usual clear sweetness. "I shall bring Harvey back with me if I can." Douglas said not a word. Turning, he walked with her to the carriage, putting her carefully in, and ar- ranging for -her comfort during her ride; then, just before he closed the door, he stooped quietly down and kissed her. If she had ever doubted her own in- stinct, she knew then that she was right, and her heart grew as glad and strong as it had been brave and faithful. Reaching Bonbrook, she was shown into the parlor, and thus, unexpectedly to both, came upon Harvey, who was reading by the window in just her old seat and attitude. Seeing who was before her, Harvey sprang up with her face all alight, with both hands ex- tended as was her wont when eager and earnest, but with such a strangely mingled sensation at her heart as prevented any welcome in words. Rose took the hands, and; sitting down upon the sofa, the two wo- men looked silently at each other. At last Rose spoke. /   OPPORTUNITY.        327' "Dear Harvey," she said, "I have come not only for the selfish pleasure of seeing you myself, but that others may share it. I am here to take you home with me." The eyes of the other made a quick movement of dissent. "I am to leave for Baltimore cly after to-morrow," she answered, as though that rendered compliance im- possible. "Ah, ves! but come, if it can be but for a few hours, for a single night," pleaded the other. "Dear Harvey, for us all to once more see each other face to face, to once more break bread together, will seem to me almost like a communion-service before we part." Harvey looked at her with the old stirred, touched look softening her eyes more and more. "I will go," she said presently, "though, as you say, it can be but for a single night." "Then we will start immediately, to make the hours as many as possible," replied Rose,; "for we can talk as we ride home." But, in spite of her words, that ride was chiefly passed in a silence too full of wandering thought and memory to be lightly broken. As they drove up to the porch, Douglas stood await- ing them; and beside him lounged Grahame, drawn hither by idleness, without the least suspicion whom the carriage contained. His brother had told him nothing; first, because he had never believed Harvey  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7732-00000164"/> '328        OPPORTUNITY. to be more to -Grahame than one of his hundred pass- ing admirations; and, second, because even her name was too close to his heart to be easily spoken. Douglas opened the carriage door, and assisted her to descend. But when she reached the ground he retained the hand he had taken, and for a full mo- ment they stood looking straight into each other's eyes. In his was the light, and upon his face the great flush, which strong emotion always brought to them; but she saw that it was the countenance of one who might lay bare his life and soul in the sight of God and man. No thoughtior wish was in his heart which would not bear the light, which was not to him rather a glory than a shame. Silently each to the other seemed to put the question of that prophet of old to the Shunamite woman, "' Is it well with thee? And she answered, It is well." Then Harvey passed on to receive Grahame's salu- tation. He was so faint with surprise and agitation that it Was almost as voiceless as his brother's had been; but he managed to say some few incoherent words, which she returned with a gentle courtesy and cordiality such as she had never before given him. Taking in the expression, not only of his face but of the whole man, even in that second her swift percep- tion had weighed him in the balance and discovered his terribly increased wanting, had measured his fall- ing from even the old low state and standard. In- stinctively her manner not only acquired, but retained,   OPPORTUNITY.       329 that accentuation of delicate consideration, that syste- matic ignoring of a too-visible fact, which we give to some physical deformity of which the possessor must be far more acutely conscious than we can be. Here spiritual declension and failure were so hopelessly evi- dent that compassion could only assume the form of apparent blindness, that surprise and pity took the place of contempt. In the moment or two before they entered the house, she had- read the whole effect of these seven long years upon both men, and had re- sumed just ler former relation with each. The morning had been somewhat advanced when Rose started for Bonbrook, and the ride of ten miles and back had required time; consequently it was now late in the afternoon, and the dinner-hour was near. Harvey was shown immediately to her room to make some slight preparation for the meal. She had ar- ranged her dress; and was standing before the glass smoothing the thick bands of black hair. She was gazing at the reflection of her own face, but with thoughts so busied -that she scarcely saw it, when there came a tap at the door. "Come in," said Harvey abstractedly, supposing it to be a servant. The door opened, and a little figure entered with' flowers in its hand. Not only the pale, delicate face, so new and yet so familiar, but the quaint self-posses- sion with which she advanced, made Harvey turn quickly to meet her with a very tender smile in her eyes. She knew instantly who it was. o  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7732-00000165"/> 330        OPPORTUNITY, "This must be little Rose," she said pleasantly, as she put her hand upon her head, unconsciously repeat- ing Douglas's expression of so long ago. "No," said the child, introducing herself with more than equal calmness and serenity, ' I am little Har- vey."* The woman knelt suddenly down before her, and took between her hands the small face thus brought somewhat on a level with her own. She was enter- ing into and comprehending all that of which this child and name were the evidence. It was little wonder that moment after moment flew by before she could speak. "Do you know who I am?" she asked at last. ' O0 yes," answered the little girl, quickly, brighten- ing into confidential communication, " you are grown- up Harvey; you are the lady I am named from, and papa says I am to be just like you in everything." "' No, no," broke out the other, passionately, " not like me,--a better woman, a better, happier woman than I ever was." Little Harvey wondered why the lady's great dark eyes had filled with tears, and why her voice sounded so strangely; but, as she said nothing more, the child remembered the errand upon which she had originally come. She held up the bunch of purple flowers in her hand. "Mamma told me to bring these heartsease to you, because, she said, I brought heartsease to/her."   OPPORTUNITY.        831 I-arvey could only take the blossoms, and fasten them upon her breast, kissing the little giver in re- turn, but with small hope that she could bring her also the priceless gift of hlappy tranquillity. To her they- were mnore truly pansies, thoughts; which had their roots in dark, cold earth, though they might raise their heads towards heaven's light. With the child's hand in hers, the two left the room to go down to the parlor. In the hall they met Rose.: Harvey took her in her arms and kissed her. "Rose, dear Rose," she said, "you ought to- be a happy woman." "Arid I am a happy woman," was the low, sweet reply. Coming into the parlor they found the family there assembled. Mrs. Grahame Ferguson sat upon a sofa near the door. She was still remarkably handsome, and Understood the art of dress thoroughly; but with all her beauty and elegance she filled Grahame with such a sense of shame that he had not the courage to say to that clear-eyed woman, "This is my wife." It was Rose who presented her. - -Mrs. Ferguson had risen with courtesy, even with deference, in her man- ner. The person who could enter a room as Harvey llad, and whose dress fitted and hung as hers, Mrs. Ferguson considered worthy of consideration. She had not taken two steps into the apartment, before that lady had resolved to inquire the name of her dressmaker. !A  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7732-00000166"/> 332        OPPORTUNITY. Harvey sat down, and talked pleasantly to Mrs. Ferguson, with somewhat the same feeling of compas- sion which had made her so kind to Grahame. -She kept the conversation so carefully within the other's comprehension that soon the lady quite shone in di- luted commonplaces, and Grahame began to breathe more freely. Gradually they all fell into this safe general talk, held intentionally at the lowest level present. This continued during dinner. But after- wards they went out on the porch, and sat in the fresh spring evening air. Here the conversation grew deeper, though no more personal; it was remarkable chiefly for what was not said, - for the instinctive care with which they all avoided ground which was dear and hallowed, but no longer for them to tread. Mrs. Ferguson soon mentally lost her place in the circle, and, finding herself bored, very sensibly retired to her own room. Grahame kept his station, but chiefly as a listener; the old tones and sentences stirring him once again with a strange sense of resurrection. It was Harvey, Rose, and Douglas who allowed their thoughts audible form, - Douglas, in whose arms his child lay quietly nestled. And thus the hours glided peacefully by, as each gave the best, the ripest fruits of the good and evil, the sorrow and joy, life had brought them, until, when they rose to separate for the night, it was with that feeling at each of their hearts which must have been at Paul's when his friends came to meet him at Appii Forum, "whom   OPPORTUNITY.       333 when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took cour- age." It was necessary for Harvey to leave early the next morning, in order to spend the last day with her mother. The whole household rose to breakfast 'with her, and bid her good by. Just before her going, she and Douglas found them- selves standing somewhat apart from the rest. Then for the first time she touched upon that which' had been in all their thoughts, underlying all their words. Gazing round upon this peaceful -home, and at the slight central figure from which all its tranquillity seemed softly diffused, her glance came back to the man's face. "My prayer has been answered," she said quietly. "Yes," the low, deep voice replied, " she has saved me."    .  . "And you," said the other, brokenly, ( ah! you have been faithful to your name, - ' Douglas, tender and true.' " The old flush upon the face and the quiver of the sensitive lips alone responded. Then came a quiet leave-taking; and Harvey drove away, having bade farewell to them and her own early life. That night, after her mother had fallen asleep, Har- vey, scenting. tobacco-smoke upon the porch, stole down stairs for a quiet talk with Dr. Dan, or perhaps an hour of silent sitting, as of yore. At first it proved to be the latter; for, taking her childish place at his  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7732-00000167"/> 334        OPPORTUNITY. feet, and laying her head upon his knee, he put out his hand and softly stroked her hair with the familiar ges- ture,- but said nothing. Except the necessary aging with years, Dr. Dan was just the Dr. Dan of old. Presently he began asking questions about her future plans; and then, the conversation came back to the present and even to the past. "Harvey," he asked at last, "do you ever intend to marry?" The inquiry had arisen somewhat naturally from others which he had put concerning a strong, true- hearted gentleman, whose apparently hopeless devo- tion to Harvey seemed but to deepen and strengthen with the deepening and strengthening of his nature. "That is as God pleases," she answered rather sad- ly. "Uncle," she continued presently, and her voice had changed perceptibly, "I was wounded terribly early in the battle of life, and since then I have been among the halt and maimed." "Yes, I know it," he replied, and his thoughts went sorrowfully and silently back to those early days. "Harvey," he said at last, and there was something like despair in his tone, "I want you to answer me one question truthfully. You have worked and won; you have been faithful to what God gave you, and have striven hard to choose the better part, --now tell me, has anything in existence yielded you real satisfaction? I frittered away my strength anid pur- pose ; I wasted my substance of heart and soul in riotous   OPPORTUNITY.       335 living, and the punishment of spiritual starvation rests rightfully upon me, -you did none of these things; yet tell me, what essential, soul-satisfying element has life ever brought you?" 'For a moment or two the woman sat motionless, not looking at him nor at the broad moonlit heavens above her, but with eyes fixed upon the low, dark horizon, and filled with a hungry, wistful light. "' I shall be satisfied when I awake with His likeness."'  This faith and hope were all she had rescued from that failure which she called her life. Ah me! from the beginning has any human heart ever truly res- cued more? The road /which led from Bonbrook to the depot touched at one point the edge of Douglas Ferguson's estate. Rather overhanging it was a small, moss- grown rock upon which the boys- had often sat to watch the passing carriages, themselves somewhat shielded from view. Remembering this rock, and knowing the hour at which she would probably reach it, Grahame came to it next morning with the hope of gaining another sight of Harvey, if not another fare- well. But he found that some one had preceded him; that the memory of another had been more per- fect than his own, or his desire more earnest. The carriage, he saw instantly, must have just passed; for Douglas was gazing down the road with a look which told Grahame the whole secret of his life. For a  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7732-00000168"/> 886     o  OPPORTUNITY. moment lie stood half stunned at the revelation, and yet amazed at his own long blindness. "Di, dear old Di, you too!" he cried out. -Douglas turned, almost as though waking from a dream; and then the truth dawned also upon him. He put his hands upon the other's shoulders, and looked down at' him very tenderly. At last they were truly brothers, through this communion of lrve and loss. "So we both loved her and lost her," he said slowly.  "Yes, but you were worthy of her "; and it was Grahame Ferguson the boy who spoke, to whom Ruth and honor and self-sacrifice were the great prizes in life. "No, no," cried Douglas, and something like a sob broke the old imperial tone, "not worthy, -only striving to be so." THE END.
