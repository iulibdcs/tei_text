BY Jove!" ejaculated Walter Westhrooke, from under his' moustache, as he stood in the library at Bellevue House, one bright May morning in the year of our Lord I788, and then, after a pause- "By Jove!" -he said again, as though he could command no other expletive, in .his utter bewilder- : ment.                        - "I wish, Walter," said a middle-aged lady, the only other :G occupant of the room, " that you would correct yourself of the I habit of using improper language. It is hard enough, Heaven, - knows! for one who has tried to be a mother to you to witness:  every day your total disregard of religion, without being swornm ;' at in this outrageous manner." "My dear sister," expostulated the young man, "I am noJqdi i swearing at you; and if i:have in any way hurt your feelings, ;i: I beg ten thousand pardons! I am only a little dazed, you i: know. You have such an awfully sudden way of announcing . things -- that  - a-by Jove! you know -I beg your pardon i- I mean you take a fellow's breath away!" - "You seem to have sufficient breath left to waste upon the ::i Devil's language," exclaimed the lady, "however much I may    &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8179-00000005"/> t4         ANNETTE; OR, have abstracted by the alarming information that a poor, or- phaned child has sought an asylum with us. There! let us say no more about it. I see plainly that the plan I have proposed is obnoxious to you; and although I might consider myself en- titled to some consideration on your part, by reason of the many sacrifices that I have made for you, I will take no ad- vantage of you, but remove myself and my few belongings to some small cottage, where- I may at least receive a friend without taking any one's breath away." "Really, Elizabeth, you do me injustice," began Walter; but she interrupted him fiercely. "Do you 'injustice'! Indeed, I think I did, when I be- lieved for a moment that you had heart enough to receive under your roof a poor, homeless fellow-creature,--fatherless, motherless, and exposed to all the worst temptations of this wicked world! But do not let me influence your decision. Drive her forth into Babylon, sir! and may her sins lie at your door-!" ' "Good heavens! Elizabeth," cried poor Walter, "I do not wish to drive the child to Babylon, or anywhere else that she does not wish to go! Why won't you listen to me?" "Swear not by the heavens!" said Elizabeth, solemnly. "This is more than I can stand!" exclaimed Walter, rapidly losing his temper, in this one-sided war of words. "Con-" i sider the lilies, of the field! ' I suppose you were about 1 to say," interrupted Elizabeth; "and I do. It is as one of hese, that I look upon this poor stray lamb to whom you  . refuse shelter!" "I have refused shelter to no one!" said Walter, not think- ing it worth while to explain that he had intended to say "Con- found it!" "So far from it, indeed, that I have made not the slightest objection to your plan, or to the young lady's remain-   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE. ,       iS  :: ing at Bellevue for the rest of her natural life! Neither have I ! any desire to promote her ruin, although I am such a godless : fellow."  "You have no objection to my plan!"echoed Elizabeth. "You are willing that she should come to Bellevue! Why,  then, could you not have said so at first, instead of arguing the- matter with me as you have been doing?"  "Why not, indeed!" said Walter, laughing heartily. "I  really cannot tell you, if you do not know. I suppose it was owing to the natural contrariness of my disposition. I have - said it now, howeVer- do not forget that - or that any friend-  of yours will be welcomed in my house, and never again speak ^ of leaving your graceless boy to take care of himself, for I -- : assure you, in that case he will go straight to the devil." ' "Hush! hush!" exclaimed Elizabeth. "Do not speak so i: lightly of the enemy of souls. He is always at hand to catch  us off our guard;" and she looked anxiously around,' as if  expecting to find- him at hero elbow. "I do not fear him whilst you remain with me," replied ., Walter; "but I am quite sure that I shall cultivate his ace-}  quaintance, if you leave me to myself!" "I shall never forsake you as long as I am not in the way!  replied Elizabeth; "and now tell me what room I am to pre-  pare for our young guest." "Whichever one you please,"replied Walter. "You know    more about such things than I do. Bring Betsey into the : council, and everything will go well.  Meanwhile, give me d, ' your letter, and I will mail it as I pass through the village; I am going out immediately."  "Thank you!" replied his sister, very much pleased at the': "-- issue of affairs. "Really, Walter, you are not so bad a fellow, -  after all."  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8179-00000006"/> I6         ANNETTE; OR, "Much obliged for the doubtful compliment," laughed Walter, as, taking the letter she handed him, he put on his hat and left the house.- This domestic breeze, in a usually peaceful household, was caused by a letter that had arrived by that morning's mail, ad- dressed to Miss Elizabeth Mordaunt, Bellevue, near P The envelope looked like any other addressed to that lady, but its contents were so astounding that, after once reading, Miss Mordaunt again turned to the outside, to ascertain if it was indeed possible for the cover of such a missive to look commonplace; then she retired to her own room, to read and reread the letter without fear of interruption. It was as follows: PHILADELPHIA, May 4, I788. After a silence of long years, during which I have never dared to address you, my present misery has given me courage to write, and, remembering your sterling worth and noble magnanimity, to ask of you, whom I have so deeply in- jured, an inestimable favor; my only plea being that this is probably the last request I shall ever make of any one, for my life is rapidly drawing to a close. To speak to you of the past seems almost an insult, and yet to ask a favor without expressing any penitence for my conduct towards you, I feel to be impossible. My life, since we parted, has been a wretched failure, a miser- able mistake; and the shadow of your wrongs has forever cast itself between me and happiness. My wife's family refused to recognize her after our marriage, and so great was our mutual unhappiness, that we determined to leave England, and seek peace of mind amid new scenes. To America, therefore, we came, and here, in Philadelphia, our first and only child was born, our little Annette, after whose birth my wife never regained her health, but, after a lingering illness, died, when the child was little more than a year old.- For sixteen years have I watched over the treasure that she   THE CHRONICLES   OF BELLEVUE.   -  left me, fearing lest a breath from heaven should blow too :: harshy on her, and I fondly hoped that I should be spared until : I saw her happily married; but God has seen fit to call nme : hence before my child has attained to womanhood, .and she for :: whom I: have so tenderly cared, will now be left alone in the . world, unless your kind heart respond to the appeal of her - almost heart-broken father, and you afford p)rotection to her"  youth and innocence.  My days are numbered. I feel the hand of death upon me.  When this letter reaches you, the 'writer may be already past your mercy. Extend, then, "your pity to my orphaned child,  and as you deal with her, so may the Lord with you -at the last great day of judgment. Your humble and penitent servant, ARTHUR PURDEN. Elizabeth Mordaunt was not a sensitive woman; on the con- trary, she prided herself on her phlegmatic disposition, yet she : could not prevent a few silent tears from stealing down' her cheeks, as she read this pathetic appeal.  She had once loved the writer of this letter, as much as she was capable of. loving any one, and although it had been years -. since she awoke from that dream, the memory of it seemed e :- sweetened by the fact that, at the close of his life, her lost : lover had returned to her in his distress. She opened a secret drawer in her desk, and took therefrom a yellow wisp of hair. Gazing upon it, she brought to mind  the .slight, graceful figure, the curly locks, the soft brown eyes- ' of her sometime lover, and wondered idly what would have /, been their life had he remained faithful to her.- Her's was a common story; she had possessed a friend and a lover, and the - friend had stolen the lover from her.  The Rev. Arthur Purden was, at this time, a young curate, . possessed of very little character, and less means. Having been "C thrown in Elizabeth Mordaunt's society, he had mistaken the,. ,  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8179-00000007"/> 18         ANNETTE; OR, admiration her sterling worth had excited in him for a warmer sentiment, and had impetuously offered her his heart and hand. Elizabeth was surprised at this offer, and very much flattered, as the handsome curate was much sought after by her com- panions, and, although she was at a loss to understand why she had been selected from her more attractive friends, she never doubted the sincerity of his professions, and was happy for a time in the hope that life had something more in store for her than she had hitherto enjoyed. Had she known more of love, she would at once have recog- nized the lack of sentiment in her lover, who, although his respect and admiration knew no bounds, could never entirely divest himself of an unpleasant sense of inferiority when in her company. Arthur was not one to analyze. his feelings, however, and he had been satisfied with the existing state of affairs until the ad- vent of pretty Alma Courtney, an old schoolmate of Elizabeth's, , who had come to London for the season, and, renewed their childish friendship.       ' Possessed of great personal beauty, a gentle deprecatory man- ner, and a habit of accepting tht man beside her as her creed, she had possessed herself of the curate's heart almost without an effort, and he, suddenly becoming aware of the mistake he had made in binding himself to Elizabeth, yet not having the -courage to own the same, felt himself utterly unequal to the struggle between inclination and duty thus forced upon him, and drifted unresistingly with the tide, until, forgetting honor, duty, everything but love, he had poured out his heart's woes into Alma's sympathizing ear. Thus it came to pass that Elizabeth, long years before this story opens, had 'stood in the rose garden one evening, hidden by the dense foliage of an arbor, and heard the man she was -       l.     ' * -   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE..         19 about to marry, passionately wooing the only woman she had ever loved or trusted, and cursing the sad fate which bound him to herself. The heavily perfumed air had seemed to stifle her, and the passionate, loving glance of her rival's eyes, as, fixed upon her lover, they drew him by their subtle light further and further from his allegiance, had seemed to burn itself upon her soul, whilst the deepening twilight overshadowed her, until within as without it was night. Betrayed! forsaken! Who knows the meaning of these bitter words but her who has learned it by experience? - Bravely had she faced the enemy, nobly had she given up her rights; but, when the last letter was destroyed, the last gift returned, and naught remained of the past but this pale lock of hair, her love had turned to bitterness, and the light died out of her life forever!  But now, as I have said, the past returned to her mind softened by the distance of long years; and, forgetful of her wrongs, she brushed the moisture from-her eyes, and with a, trembling hand replied to her lost lover's appeal. BELLEVUE, May 6, 1788. DEAR SIR: I am in receipt of your letter dated May 4, and need scarcely tell you of my surprise and concern at its contents. I sincerely sympathize with you in your present trouble, and hasten to relieve your mind of all anxiety in regard to your daughter's future. Such a home as I have, I freely offer to Annette, and although, from my retired habits, it may not prove congenial to your daughter, I can safely promise you that she shall not be exposed- to the temptations of the world, and that I will do my best to promote her welfare, both spiritual and temporal. As to the past, let it not distress you. I give to you the for- giveness that I crave for myself from the Almighty, and may He forgive me as entirely as I do you!     &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8179-00000008"/> 20         ANNETTE; OR, In conclusion, may the good Shepherd conduct you in safety through the valley of the shadow of death; and may we one day meet before the throne of the Father, with our souls washed white as snow in the precious blood of the Lamb! Your sincere friend, ELIZABETH MORDAUNT. This letter was written, sealed, and directed before Elizabeth bethought her of what Walter might say to this innovation in their domestic life. He must, of course, be consulted before she sent the invitation, and it was with a palpitating heart that she took her way down stairs, to state the case to him. How he received the intelligence, we already know. Let me, therefore, pause awhile, and tell you something of Bellevue and its environs. CHAPTER II. THE WESTBROOKE FAMLY PORTRAITS. IN the year 1740 the present town of? was no more than a little village, consisting of low! irregularly built houses, one broad street, a church, a meeting-house, and a tavern. It had originally been settled by the Quakers in the year I680, but its eligible situation--just half way between two cities -soon attracted the attention of other colonists, and in I74o the Quaker settlement was the smallest portion of it. The character of the country thereabouts was undulating. Low and flat near the river Delaware, hilly as it approached the north, mountainous on and near the northern line, and this   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        2i little village, situated on a high ridge, commanded a view at once charming and picturesque. In the far distance a mountain reared its majestic head, whilst here and there upon the landscape arose smaller crests, crowned by beautiful woodland on the heights, where the settler's axe had not yet fallen, and interspersed with waving fields of golden grain, a living sign of the advance of civilization. Some tracts of land had been bought in the vicinity by ' English gentlemen of fortune, and commodious dwellings might have been seen arising on these " clearings," as they endeavored to make for themselves homes in the new world in some way 'approaching those they had left behind them. Most of these gentlemen were well known to each other- had sailed from England in the same vessel, and still continued to keep up intercourse with the mother country; but one among them had arrived suddenly and alone, giving no account ofI A himself whatever.   This gentleman was Mr. George Westhrooke, our hero's father! 3 who, leaving friends and kindred, had exiled himself from hio S to seek name and fame in the colonies, then attracting the'ate tion of all civilized Europe.  Choosing a pleasant site about a mile distant from the vil- is lage, on a crest which commanded a fine view of the adjacent ^/: country, Mr. Westhrooke had devoted himself to the felling'of timber, the building of houses, and the tilling of land with such untiring energy that from chaos he soon produced order, and his neighbors were forced to acknowledge that there was no finer homestead in P--- than Bellevue. - George Westhrooke held but little intercourse with those around him. Having left home a misanthropist on account of the "lady of his heart," having made the grievous mistake of. marrying his friend instead of himself, he desired nothing so - much as to escape mankind generally.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8179-00000009"/> 22         ANNETTE; OR, He remained at Bellevue for some years, becoming more and more enamored of a life of freedom, so that when, on his fa- ther's decease, he was summoned to return to England, he set sail reluctantly, and with the settled determination to remain no longer absent than was absolutely necessary. He had not calculated, however, on again meeting la dame de ses pensees once more free, and although encumbered with a little daughter, and no longer in the first bloom of youth, still sufficiently attractive to arouse his dormant affec- tion, and lead him to prolong his stay in order to persuade her to become his wife. Mrs. Mordaunt listened more favorably to this his second suit, and was, indeed, only too happy to secure for herself arid child so efficient a protector and so kind a friend. Alas! brief were their years of happiness; for ere their lit- tle son Walter was six years old, his mother died suddenly of an epidemic fever. Elizabeth Mordaunt was at this time fifteen years of age, and on her devolved the entire care of her little brother, for George Westhrooke never recovered from the shock of his sudden be- reavement, but, after lingering a helpless invalid a couple of years longer, followed his wife to the grave. In appearance, Elizabeth was dark and forbidding; in dispo- sition, self-reliant and reserved. She was not a girl to win affec- tion easily, and none knew this better than herself, so that when in her nineteenth year Arthur Purden had proposed to her, she was, as I have said, taken completely by surprise. Poor child! when the storm had burst over her head, and the light had died out in the east, back she went to her old life, and tried to take it up where she had left it, but the thread was broken, the skein tangled, and the pieces could not be joined.'   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         23 Whether, as she thought herself, she would have been a dif-  ferent woman had she married, I cannot say. Perhaps, in an atmosphere of love, her character would have softened. -But; we  have not to do with what she might have been, but what she was at this time - a calm, impassive woman, past the springtime and3.\ summer of youth, and with the hoar-frost, that herald of the  winter of old age, thickly sprinkled on her head.      r Her time was devoted to her charge, and earnestly did she endeavor to promote his welfare, physical, mental, and moral. In - the first case she succeeded admirably, for Walter grew into a fine, muscular young man, pleasant for the eye to look upon; : - ;in the second, also, she had reason to be satisfied, but in the third she failed signally. Walter possessed a will even stronger than her own, and very soon she perceived the futility of attempting to govern  ; him; she therefore made a virtue of necessity, and yielded  -gracefully to what it was beyond her power to control, only - n striving to incline him towards the right.      -    i This was not always possible, however, surrounded as he was--  by very questionable companions, and many sad and anxious . i hours did Elizabeth pass on account of her brother's wander- ? 3 ings from the path of duty. He undoubtedly loved her, and  that was her great comfort. She dwelt upon it in her heart ;S3 many a time when his selfish inconsideration had wounded her deeply. Thoughtlessness was perhaps his greatest vice; and for his ; virtues, he was brave, generous, and open-hearted - willing to - stand by a friend whether right or wrong, believing earnestly .: :;i in his fellow-creatures, and at all times a champion of the weak.

It grieves me to state it, but it behooves me as his biographer not to con- ceal the truth, and such was the melancholy fact. The " how," the "why," and the "wherefore," I shall not now disclose, but if the reader has patience to continue unto the end, he shall have the story placed before him in all its details. Suffice it to say at present that he " came to grief," and also, to Eliza- beth, his best friend, for advice and assistance. She entered earnestly into his trouble, and fully agreed with him in the opinion that a short absence from London would be advisable, proposing at the same time that he should leave England altogether, and they should both emigrate to America. Her object was to withdraw him, if possible, from the pernicious society by which he was surrounded, and, as it happened, the suggestion accorded well with Walter's own wishes, so they made their arrangements with all possible speed, and set sail for America. It was not without considerable nervous trepidation that Elizabeth approached her new home, for the idea prevalent at that time in England, in regard to the States, was that they were in a totally uncivilized condition - savages, wild beasts, and log cabins being the general character of the settlements. These, however, had had their day, and now traces of civili- zation were everywhere visible, whilst? had grown vigor- ously even since the elder Mr. Westhrooke had built Bellevue. Churches of various denominations reared their spires. A "college stood embowered amid lofty trees, facing the main street in the centre of the town. Commodious dwelling-houses were no longer confined to the neighboring country-seats; a vast amount of woodland had disappeared, and in its place were orderly farms, and neat, trim flower-gardens.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       . 25 A post-office also added to its importance, and the mails, no longer carried by solitary horsemen over almost impassable roads, arrived now every day, whilst the coach passed through on its way from Philadelphia to New York once every twenty- four hours. All this was an agreeable surprise to Elizabeth, and when, the, long journey over, she found herself issuing from a cool, shady lane, and passing through a gate into Bellevue itself, her heart was filled with gratitude that things were no worse. A beautiful sloping lawn met her eye, shaded by lofty elm, chestnut, and oak trees, whilst a smooth gravel walk led up, by an easy ascent, to the house - a long, low building, painted white, and embedded in ivy, wild roses, and honeysuckles. There was not much style about its architecture, it is true, but Elizabeth forgave that when she came to find how roomy and comfortable it was within, and the fine view it commanded. Behind the house was a slope of still greater extent, and then came the farm, with its barns, poultry-yard, dairy, and shining  E fields of grain, bordered by a beautiful piece of woodland, i through which ran a sparkling brooklet. All was found to be in good order, and the brother and sister felt that they had reason to congratulate themselves on the step they had taken, which had brought them into a country so full of novelty, and yet not without some comforts. Great was the excitement in? at their arrival. The pop- ulation was now considerable, and divided into various classes; with as much- regard to les convenances as accorded with persons of their pretensions. Who were the strangers? whence did they come, and were they to be visited? were the questions that repeatedly :*i* recurred during the first few days after their arrival. But as no one was wiser than his neighbor, it was decided to leave them  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8179-00000011"/> 26 ,        ANNETTE; OR, to- themselves until 'after the approaching Sunday, that they might be first subjected to a personal scrutiny on attending public- worship. The churches were crowded that day to see the strangers; but the congregations were doomed to disappointment, for they came not to any of them. At first each discontented flock took it for granted that this godless pair had attended divine service elsewhere; but when it came to be generally known that they had not left their house through the entire day, then, indeed, the excitement became intense. The religious element was, predominant in? at this time, and that peculiar ascetic type that banned all the pleasures of life as snares of the evil one. A strict observance of the Sab- bath was enforced, and not only did the heads of families invariably attend public worship, but the "sons and the daugh-, ters, the men-servants and the maid-servants," were forced to do so; therefore when "the stranger that was within their gates " so openly defied their laws, it was not to be wondered at that these worthy people were filled with consternation. Walter and Elizabeth became the subjects of especial prayer throughout the community during the following week, and the pastors of the various flocks called upon them, each eager for their conversion to his peculiar tenets. So furious did the contest become, at last, between these worthy gentlemen, that Elizabeth found it necessary to enlist under some banner, if only to'prevent further disputation. She therefore selected the Rev. Archibald (Stone for her leader, not because he particularly pleased her, but because his church was the one nearest to Bellevue. But through this chance selection Elizabeth was to experience an entirely new sensation, in a religious revival. Hitherto her   [  THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.      !n::27 religion had been very vague, and she had believed that as long I  as she told no lies, defrauded not her neighbor, and said her ;  prayers when she remembered them, she was fulfilling the whole duty of woman. Not long, however, did the Rev. Archibald allow her to remain in this comfortable state of security, after !: she had enrolled herself among his parishioners. Soon her proud spirit quailed before "the thunders of the law," and ghastly visions of " the wrath to come," the "bot- tomless pit, " and "eternal damnation" filled her soul with wonder and dread. This character of religion suited Elizabeth's nature. No ministry of love could have touched her he'art'so deeply. Awakened to the fact that as a guilty sinner she stood daily in danger of punishment, she threw herself heart and soul into the endeavor to make her salvation sure. Often and often did she bless the day on which she came to P-- , and even went so far as to regard Walter's troubles with extreme complacency, looking upon them as " a means to an end." But he, poor fellow, could not take this view of the case, and became indignant at her absorption in good works.- -  Thus passed the next four or five years.

ENTER ANNETTE. FOR seventeen years Annette had passed a careless, happy, uneventful life. She lost her mother whilst she was still too young to appreciate the extent of her misfortune, and since that time her father's gentle and considerate love had supplied every need of her affectionate heart. She knew now that he was sick, but he had been an invalid for years, and she appre- hended no immediate danger. He never complained of'feeling unwell, and always greeted her with a cheerful, loving smile. She therefore was quite satisfied, and never dreamed that he hid his suffering, and assumed a cheerfulness that he was far from feeling, to save her pain. More than once Arthur felt that it was his duty to prepare her for their approaching separation, but when he looked upon her the words died upon his lips, and he could not make up his mind to bring a cloud upon that happy, sunshiny face. "Suf- ficient unto the day is the evil thereof," he would say to him- self. "She will know it all soon enough." Thus matters went on until the day after he wrote to Eliza- beth, when he was taken suddenly and alarmingly ill. The words he had put off speaking up to this time could not be spoken now, for he at once lost consciousness. Very much alarmed, Annette sent immediately for the physician, but Ar- thur was speechless when he arrived, and Annette could give him no clue to the cause of the seizure. "Poor fellow," said the doctor, "I thought he would have lasted longer. It is an inward hemorrhage, I fear. He is past all suffering, however," he added, in a comforting tone, to An-   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        29 nette; " he may or may not recover his consciousness, but his end will be peaceful." "I do not understand you!" said Annette, fixing her fright- ened eyes upon him. "Is my father very ill? Surely, surely, he is not in danger?" "Why, my dear child," said the doctor, " is it possible that you did not know how ill he was? Your father has been dying slowly for months past. When he consulted me a year ago, I told him there wass no hope." "Dying all this time," moaned Annette, " and he never told me;" and then, entirely unprepared for this crushing blow, she fell senseless upon the floor. "Dear! dear! this is a very unpleasant business," exclaimed the doctor. "Why are men such fools as to suppose that thel can escape death by not talking about it? What am I to do with the child? Here! Jane! Sarah!" he shouted, putting his head out of the door, " come to the young lady; she has fainted." But no Jane or Sarah answered his summons, and the good doctor was obliged to attend to her himself. He was a kind- hearted man, and his sympathies became enlisted for the poor lonely girl, thus thrown-on his care, as he chafed her cold i hands, and sprinkled her face with water, to restore her to con- sciousne$ss. "That is right!" he exclaimed, as she at length opened her eyes with a sigh. "Now you feel better, don't you?" "Yes,"- replied Annette, making an effort to rise, "I feel quite well; what has happened to me?" but as she spoke,.her  eye rested upon the helpless figure stretched upon the bed,and the recollection of her sorrow came back to her. "Oh, I forgot!" she sobbed. "You said he was going to die, Father! father darling! how can I ever bear to live without -X you?" and the color again deserting her face, she staggered - back into a chair.                  . -   &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8179-00000013"/> 30         ANNETTE; OR, "Come, come," said the doctor, energetically, "this really won't do, you know. I cannot stay here all day and nurse you as well as your father. Exert some self-control, my dear young lady. Why, you could do no more if your father were already dead. Save'your tears until there is nothing left to do but weep, and nurse him whilst he is still alive." Thus adjured, Annette recovered her composure with an effort, and turned to take the doctor's directions, although her heart seemed breaking. "Tell me what I am to do for him," she said in a choked voice; "he shall not die for want of care." "Bravely spoken," replied the doctor; "I am glad you ae - yourself again. Do not cry any more; believe me, fretting never does any good. As to your father, you must watch him very carefully, and as soon as he is able to swallow, give him his cordial, and follow it up with some nourishing food. Is there no one you can send for to help you nurse him?" con- tinued the doctor. "I am afraid it is too hard for you to remain here alone." "No," replied Annette, shaking her head, "there is no one. We have been all in all to each other ever since I can first remember, and I will stay with him alone to the end." "Poor child!" said the doctor, hastily brushing the moisture from his eyes. "Well, keep up a good heart, and we will do our best to bring him through this attack, as we have so many times before through similar ones." "May I send for you if he gets worse?" said Annette, with quivering lip. "He knows you so well that it will not be like introducing a stranger." "To be sure you may," replied the doctor; "but I will be in again this evening, in any case, to see if there is any change. Good-bye."    THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         31 "Good-bye!" repeated Annette mechanically, but I doubt if she knew exactly when the doctor left the room, so absorbed was she in contemplation of the sombre, motionless figure upon the bed, whose fitful breathing alone showed signs of life. "All alone in the world!" ejaculated the doctor, as he sprang into his carriage. "What is to -become of her after her father's death? Surely, she must have some relations. 'We have been all in all to each":other!' she said. Poor child, God help her." After the doctor had left her, Annette turned towards the bed, and bending over her father, sought long and eagerly for some sign of returning consciousness, but the half-closed. eyes still retained their vacant stare, and she sank down on a low chair beside the bed, covering her face with her hands. A host of memories crowded on her brain as she sat there, and she seemed to live her childhood over again. Again she was a little toddling thing, holding tight to that father's hand as she journeyed in triumph around the room, so proud to walk by his side. Then she was on his knee, listening whilst he read to her, and taught her how to read, or kneeling at his feet whilst he held her little hands and heard her repeat her childish prayer. The visions thronged around her in the growing twilight, with the same figure ever in the foreground--this gentle, loving ;^ father, her friend, companion, and counsellor through all her short life.   Oh! how could she let him go? how could she live without  :. him?  Her heart rose up in rebellion against Providence, and although she would fain have prayed, her lips refused to move. - How long she sat this way she could not tell, for she took no note of time; but suddenly there was a slight movement from the figure on the bed, and a,faint voice whispered:    :1 i  , i: r   &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8179-00000014"/> "Netta!"  "Yes, father," 'she answered, springing to her feet and bending over him. A few hours before and that weak, changed voice would have pierced her to the heart; but now it was dif- ferent; she had never expected to hear it again, and it fell like music on her ear.  In a moment the doctor's words rushed upon her mind-by careful nursing she might keep him with her for some days longer; so she resolutely mastered her palpitating heart, and placing her arm under him, raised him gently and administered the cordial. A eenstotgh Then she laid him back upo n the p illows, and stroking the hair from his temples, gazed earnestly into his face, afraid to trust herself to speak, lest her voice should betray her-emotion. The observation, however, reassured her, for her father's face had resumed its ordinary expression, and his mild blue eyes looked affectionately into hers. "You feel better, do you not?" she ventured to say at last. "Yes, I think I do," he answered faintly. Is it growing dark?" he added, in sudden terror; "I cannot see you. "Yes," Annette answered, hastily, "it is quite late. Iam going to light the lamp." She crossed the room, and lighting the little lamp brought it to the stand beside the bed.  "Now, then," she said, "you can see me, can you not and she took her seat directly in front of him, that she might be full in his view. "The light is not very bright," murmured poor Arthur, looking yearningly towards her; "there seems to be a thin blue mist between us. Come nearer to me, Netta! She canoe close to his side, and kneeling down by the bed, laid her soft cheek against his hand.   He smiled faintly, and endeavored to caress her with the other one, but the effort was too great, and his trembling hand sank powerless upon the coverlid X "You look so like your mother to-night!" he said, at length. "Do I?" said Annette ; "I am glad of that; then you will love me all the more." He sighed deeply as he answered, "That is not possible, my darling, and it may make others love you less." Annette looked at him with surprise. "I do not under- stand," she said, gently. "Why should any one love me less because of my resemblance to my mother, and who is there to love me besides yourself?" "Ah, it is a long story," he answered. "I have not strength to tell it to you." "No, of course not," said Annette. "You have talked' too much already, I fear; now be perfectly quiet whilst I get you some gruel," and she rose from her knees to go for the nourishment. "Do not be long gone, Netta," said the sick man. "I cannot bear to lose sight of you, the time is so short, so very short." Annette did not ask him what he meant, for her heart told her he was alluding to their approaching separation, and she turned quickly from him to hide her tell-tale face, as she felt the hot tears filling her eyes. "I will be gone but a few minutes," she said, as she hurried away.  Returning with all possible haste, she propped him up with pillows, and administered the gruel in small spoonfuls, laugh- ingly calling him her baby, and urging one spoonful more each time he would have ceased eating.    &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8179-00000015"/> 34+        ANNETTE; OR, "That will do, Netta," he said, at last. "I can take no more even to please you, so take away the bowl and come back to your old place beside me, for I feel strong enough to talk a little to you, and I have much to say." She complied with his request, and, much cheered by the apparent improvement in him, took her seat by the bed, hold- ing his thin hand in both of hers. Thus they sat for some time in silence, whilst Arthur seemed to be collecting himself, arranging his scattered thoughts to be able to speak connectedly. "Netta," he said, at last, " there is no use deceiving our- selves any longer with false hopes, for I am evidently failing very rapidly. I put off speaking of the future to you whilst my end seemed still months away, but now that from months it has become a matter not even of weeks, but of days, it is cowardly, my darling, to put it off any longer, so I will nerve myself for the effort, and speak freely to you." "No, no, father," said Annette, energetically; " the- doctor said you must not excite yourself. I will not allow you to talk on such distressing subjects." ( " I am not going to excite myself, if possible," replied her father, " but it is necessary'to tell you the arrangements I have made for you, that you may know how to act after I. am gone." Netta made no answer, only stooped her head a little nearer to him, that she might not lose one of the precious words. "Years ago," began Arthur, "before I met your mother, I was - I had -that is I met--" but the words seemed to cleave to his tongue, and the tale was not so easy to tell as he had supposed, at least with that style of opening, so he began again. "That is, when your mother first met me, she was, - I mean   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE. 35' she had,--" and here he stopped again, his poor thin;face fushed with agitation, and his breath coming and going quickly from exhaustion. "That will do, dear father," said Annette.  " You must not say any more. Of what possible consequence can it be to me, what took place before I was born ? And it is too agitating a ubject for you to discuss at present. " Arthur sighed deeply, and laid perfectly still for a few mo- ments, revolving in his mind whether it was absolutely neces- sary to repeat to his daughter the old story of his breach of faith to Elizabeth. It could do no good, he thought, and yet it would serve to explain to Netta certain asperities of char- acter in the former, which he felt would be prominent when she recognized in his child the living image of her mother. To temporize, with Arthur, was to be lost,so he ultimately made up his mind that a confession was unnecessary, and had better be put off for a more convenient season. "I believe you are right, Netta," he said.  "I am notstrong enough for exciting conversation, so, my child, I will only say that I have applied to an old friend of your mother's to take care of you in case of accident to myself, and if she agrees to under. take the charge, which I think she will, I pray you, my darling, to follow her: guidance in all things, giving her the love and respect that have always been mine heretofore. Will you prom- ise me, Netta? "That, or anything else you wish," said Netta, in a low voice. "And   now that your mind is at ease, lie down, I be- seech you, and take a little rest. Let me move the pillows from behind ygou There; now you are comfortable, so go to sleep ike a good boy, and  I will sit beside you and  sing softly." "Good-night," said her father.   "Kiss me, Netta.  God's blessing  on you, my little girl. Good-night." &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8179-00000016"/> 36         ANNETTE; OR, And Arthur turned his face to the wall, closing his eyes and shutting out forever the sight'of the little homelike room and the sweet figure at the bedside, singing an old song in a low, sweet voice, to soothe her father to rest. Shorter and shorter became the respiration of the dying man, , sweeter and softer became the voice of the singer, and the doc- tor paused on the threshold of the door for a moment, as he was  entering to make a last visit to his patient, to catch the faint  cadence from within.  As she finished the song her eyes fell on the doctor, and,  rising softly, she approached him with her finger on her lip to X impose silence.  "He has been so much better," she whispered. "He recov- I! ered his consciousness entirely, and took both the cordial and ! the nourishment. He was tired, and I sang him to rest, and I oh, he is sleeping so sweetly."  ' I am very glad to hear such a good report, my dear," said  Doctor Wallis, "very glad, indeed; and if he continues to a, do so well, who knows but we may have him about again in a i few weeks?" and he shook her cordially by the hand to express i his congratulations. "I had secured a woman to sit with you to-night," he added, "in case your father should not be so well ; but I do not sip- pose you will need her now, so I will just take a look at my patient, without disturbing him, and then drive around to her i house and tell her that she will not be needed."  So saying,-the doctor stepped to the side of the bed, and ! bending over poor Arthur, listened for the breathing that had : ceased almost at the same moment as the music. He stooped lower still; no sound'! With a sudden fear he ' turned up the lamp and proceeded to the other side of the bed, towards which the patient's face was turned.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        37 37 -   :! One glance at the pale, still face was sufficient, and it needed not his finger on the dead man's pulse to tell the doctor that he was no more; but he put it there, nevertheless, to gain time before turning to Annette, and to think how he could break the news to her, all unsuspecting as she was. She had crept up to the opposite side of the bed and fixed- her eyes on the doctor's face. "How soundly he sleeps," she whispered, as the doctor re- leased the hand he was holding, which fell heavily upon the bed. "Yes," answered the doctor Solemnly, ' he is taking agood rest. 'And He giveth His beloved sleep.'- "What do you mean?" stammered Annette, clinging to the bed to support herself in the sudden tremor that had seized her.  "Oh, doctor, is he worse?" The doctor crossed over to where she was standing, and put- ting his arm around her, pressed her down into the chair behind her, then taking her hand, he said gently: "My dear young lady, I think you know what I am going to say; your father is beyond all earthly pain--he is happier than  we who are left to mourn him.

The necessary arrangements being made, the doctor ap- proached Annette, and drew her gently from the bed. "He is no longer there,dear child," he said; "you must think of him in heaven. Come with me now, and I will take care of you until you are able to make some other plan for yourself." Annette made no remonstrance. All her life she had obeyed another, never acting for herself; and she now suffered the doctor to lead her down the stairs to his carriage, which was in waiting, without a thought of resistance; and, silently entering it, was whirled quickly away forever from the only home she had ever known. ?,.d * i   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         39 39 CHAPTER     IV.            ::: WHAT MRS. BECK THOUGHT ABOUT IT. FOR the next few days Dr. Wallis had more work upon his hands than he could well perform. Added to his ordinary duties, which were at all timesonerous, he was obliged to take upon himself the entire charge of poor Arthur's funeral, and also nurse Annette, who had been completely prostrated by her bereavement. This period of her life, when she tried to recall it in after years, always appeared confused. She never knew exactly how she came to the doctor's, nor what she did there during these first few days. It was like a horrible nightmare. Her father's death seemed so unreal that she could not prevent herself from starting at every footfall, in the vague expectation that he would come and take her home again. The good doctor was very kind and considerate, doing his best, in an uncouth fashion, to cheer her; but there is a vast difference between seventeen and sixty; and h e-found it impos- sible to bridge over the space of time and be a boy again to- please her. They had no interests in common, and frequently passed hours together without speaking, for want of a subject with which they were both conversant. This was not so dreary for the doctor---to whom the novelty of a sweet face at his fireside was in itself a pleasure - as it was for Annette, who felt more keenly every day the loss of her kind companion, into whose willing earshe had been wont to pour out all her joys and sorrows, how evertrivial. She tried hard to repress all outward expression of sadness, knowing that her benefactor was doing all in his power to make her happy; but as the days grew into weeks , and still the expected lette r  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8179-00000018"/> ANNETTE; OR, 40 from Elizabeth came not, her anxiety becalne irrepressible. What was to become of her if Elizabeth took no notice of her father's appeal? She had already trespassed onthe doctor's hos- pitality, and remained longer with him, she knew, than he had expected. Up to this time she had made no inquiry as to what property her father had left her; but now she felt it behooved her to enter into the subject and form some plan for the future. The doctor's mind was also troubled, and on the same sub- ject; yet he feared to wound Annette's feelings by speaking of her unfortunate position, friendless and alone in the world as she was. By Arthur's will he had been appointed her trustee, and the money she inherited from her mother was quite sufficient to save her from want; but it did not seem right that a girl of her age, and so tenderly nurtured as she had been, should be obliged, even if she were able, to live alone and take care of herself. In the absence of all relatives, however, the doctor saw no alternative--unless, indeed, she consented to remain where she was, which would at once settle all difficulties. This seemed to be the only possible solution of the problem that was troub- ling him, and he had fully determined to propose the plan to Annette, when his mind was once more unsettled by a visi of remonstrance on the part of his housekeeper. Mrs. Beck, for such was her name, was the widow of a Revo- lutionary soldier, and prided herself on her gentle breeding and avoir faire. The doctor had taken her into his household a her husband's death, and she had been there ever since; no only governing the domestic affairs, but the doctor himself- ruling with a rod of iron. She now looked upon Anett with alarm. This girl had been suddenly introduced into th establishment, not only without her concurrence, but eve without her knowledge; had been there now for nearly [,j   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        4! s month, and still showed no signs of an intention to depart. Mrs. Beck felt her throne tottering under her. Annette was far too young and pretty not to be a formidable rival. What if this interloper should become a permanent fixture? The doctor evidently thought a great- deal of her; she was never absent from his thoughts, apparently. At one time it was, "Mrs.-Beck, are you sure Miss Purden's room is comfortable?" at another, "Let us have some little delicacy for dinner to-day, Mrs. Beck, to tempt our young lady's appetite;" besides which, he never returned from his daily round of visits without fruit, flowers, or some little remembrance for Annette. This was all very suspicious; and the worthy woman decided that it would be impolitic to permit the doctor to become entangled in' this designing creature's toils, and that she must "nip" his growing interest "in the bud." She must speak her mind to the doctor without loss of time. She fixed on the following evening, the twenty-eighth of May, to carry out her plan, and, waiting until the doctor had left the dining-room, she followed him th the office, stealthily,. lest Annette should suspect and frustrate her design. He was seated in his easy chair when the housekeeper entered, and unsuspectingly raised his head and greeted her: "Ah! Mrs. Beck," he said, "I hope I find you well this evening?" "Tolerable, thank you," replied that lady ; "as well, sir, as adverse circumstances will permit."  "Adverse circumstances?" repeated the doctor. "Why, what has gone wrong in the household?" "If you mean the servants' hall, by the household," replied Mrs. Beck, with strong emphasis, "I believe everything is going on well and orderly in that department." "Ah! then the trouble is up-stairs?" said the doctor inter- 4"  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8179-00000019"/> 42         ANNETTE; OR,               i rogatively. "Nothing the matter with Miss Purden, I hope," he added, anxiously. "As far as her bodily health is concerned," replied Mrs. Beck, "I believe she is quite well." "What the deuce is the matter with her, then?" exclaimed the doctor, impatiently. "Why don't you speak out, and say what you mean, so that I can understand you?" "That is just what I am going to -do," replied Mrs. Beck, "just what I am here for. It is not a pleasant task that I have set myself, but I am here to perform it. Hard, indeed, it is for a poor lone woman like myself, whose husband lies stiff and cold beneath the ground, to speak on such delicate subjects to an unmarried man like yourself, and I have put it off from day to day, trusting that there might be no necessity to do it at all, but I feel now that the time has come, and I must hold back no longer; so I says to myself to-day, says I, 'Amanda Beck, do your duty. When before did you shirk it? And will you stand by silently now, whilst this poor orphaned child is a losing of her character?" Mrs. Beck assumed an air of self- righteousness as she uttered these words, which completely overwhelmed the doctor. "Losing her character!" he exclaimed, in great amazement. "Why, Mrs. Beck, what are you talking about? How can the poor child lose her character here, when she seldom goes out and knows no one?  "She knows you, sir, I suppose," said Mrs. Beck, venomously. "And what harm, under heaven, do I do the child?" said the doctor, staring blankly at his irate housekeeper. "And 'what harm' is it, you say?"  said the indignant woman. "And is it no harm to have the innocent dove a livin' in your house, and you not the first end of a wife or child to make you respectable?"   "Bless my soul, woman, you must be a fool!" said the doctor, excitedly. What possible objection can you find to a homeless girl seeking protection of an old, bald-headed crea- ture like myself? You must be beside yourself." "Oh, it 's not me as says it, " whimpered Mrs. Beck, subdued oby the doctor's fiery outhurst. "It's not for the likes of Amanda Beck to remark on the conducts of such as you; but it 's the waord, doctor, it's the censorous world- " And. what can any one say against it? said the doctor. "Staying with me, a man old enough to be her father." "eOh, as to the age," answered Mrs. Beck, "that ain't no account whatever. There's those as likes a husband to be con- siderable older thanthemselves. They ain't so apt to get dissi- pated, you know; they're more settled like; and as to looks-, bless my heart, you 'zve no reason to complain or: that score;  you 're better looking than many a younger man, and you're not at all bald; you've only a beautiful high forehead. " There was no answering this style of attack, so the doctor did not attempt it, simply saying: That will do, Mrs. Beck, you can go. I will think of what you have said." "Very well, sir," she replied, turning towards the door.- ', I'm going; I  only hope I haven't offended you by my plain speak- ing. I know it's not my place to interfere, but Miss Purden seemed so upset about what folks might say, that I thought I'd just make bold to speak." "What do you say?" exclaimed the doctor. "Did she men- tion the subject to you? Did she say she was troubled by it ?" Well, she didn't exactly say that much," replied Mrs. Beck, finding that when it came to the point lying was not so easy as it seemed;  "but I can see as well as  another, and I knew what she was fretting about, so I just said to myself, I '1*  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8179-00000020"/> "         ANNETTE; OR, fix it all straight for her. Ah! poor lamb, she thinks a good deal of you, doctor, and small blame to her; for you 've been a -kind friend to her. Aye, and to more than her," added Amanda, putting her handkerchief to her eyes, " but you really oughtn't to let her get too fond' of you. It 's a shame, for the poor girl's sake," and she retreated rapidly from the room, leaving the doctor hopelessly bewildered.          I Such a state of things had never suggested itself to him. An-  nette too fond of him-it was amazing. Was he younger than he I supposed, or better looking? Could Amanda's words be true?  And then, on thinking the matter over, her view of the case became more probable, and he began to believe that it really I might be so. The poor child was without friends or kindred, i and perhaps her grateful heart had turned to him, her protector, i in the necessity for some one on whom to lavish the wealth of  love that had been her father's.              T The doctor had long since given up all idea of ever marrying, but the picture of life with Annette which now rose before him was alluring, and his time-honored principles faded away before it. He would ask her to marry him. She could but say no-- and if she said yes! - how the world would talk. . Sixty years wedded to seventeen! Hang the world! who cared what it said. He was not going to marry for the world, but . for his own personal gratification; and having thus decided, he arose from his seat and gazed at himself in the mirror over the 1 mantel, to weigh the chances of " yes" and " no!" He drew  a thin wisp of hair over the smooth crown of his head, and g endeavored to make himself believe that it grew there, but this A: effort of imagination was too great, and, disgusted with himself, A he turned abruptly from the mirror.            i   THE CHRONICLES OF, BELLEVUE.        45  CHAPTER V. THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA; OR, IS IT INFECTIOUS? ANNETTE had entered the room some moments before, but had remained transfixed upon the hearth-rug at the extraordinary apparition of her good friend, the doctor, stand- ing on tip-toe, and making hideous faces at himself in the look- ing-glass. Had he gone mad? or was he slightly intoxicated? but before -she had time to reflect on the subject, he turned so suddenly upon her that she nearly lost her balance. "I beg ten thousand pardons," he exclaimed, grasping her arm to steady her; "I hope I did not hurt you?"' "Oh, no, not at all," replied Annette, looking at him in perplexed alarm; "I should be the one to apologize for coming upon you unawares. I did not knock before entering, as I sup- posed you were expecting me, for it is tea-time. " "Of course I was! of course I am!" replied the doctor, with difficulty recovering his presence of mind. "Sit down. You know that you are welcome here at all times." "You  are very kind to say so," replied Annette, seating herself, and then they relapsed into silence, and the doctor's reverie seemed so profound that Annette feared to interrupt him, although she had determined to speak to him this evening of herself and her future plans. She would interest herself first in his affairs, and afterwards bring the conversation round to the subject nearest her heart. " May I venture to ask the subject of your thoughts?" she asked, with a smile; "some very difficult case, I suppose, that has come under your care?" "Oh, no, you are mistaken; that is-of course I yes t - it was of a case, you see, a case / " replied the doctor, nervously.   &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8179-00000021"/> "        ANNETTE; OR, "I trust it is not a hopeless one?" said Annette. "Oh, I hope not," replied the agitated doctor; "I trust not, indeed.  Silence again ensued for some moments, and then Annette ventured another question. "What is the disease?" she asked, innocently. "Disease!" ejaculated the doctor. ' Oh, yes, it is a very bad disease, very bad, indeed." "What are the symptoms?" asked Annette. "Eh?" queried the doctor, as though he had suddenly lost his hearing; "the symptoms! oh! yes! well, they vary: there are cold fits and hot fits, exhilaration of spirits, great despondency." 'Dear me," said Annette, 'what a curious disease- it must be ' chills and fever. "' "Nothing of the kind, I assure you," answered the doctor quickly; " quite the reverse." "That would be ' fever and chills,' "said Annette, smiling; "is there any fever?" "Yes, there is fever-a great deal of fever, and undue excitement."  "Is it infectious?" asked Annette. "Oh, my dear young lady," said the doctor, sitting very upright on his chair and clasping his little fat hands together, "I hope it is- oh, if it only was! Is it? Just answer me that one question." "I would, with all my heart, if I only knew," said Annette, in an alarmed voice, as her former fears 'came back to her- of insanity or " delirium tremens. " "Oh, if I could only believe it to be infectious," continued the doctor; "if I could only think that you would catch it from me- or I had caught it from you - -or we had both taken it together, my mind would be at rest."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        47 "Really, I am at a loss to understand you," said Annette-. "You can take no disease from me, I am quite sure, for there is nothing the matter with me, and you appear to be perfectly well yourself. What, then, are you talking about? Will you be -;: so good as to explain?" .                 :- "Yeo may be well," said the doctor, "but as for myself, I feel ill, very ill," and he uttered a moan of distress. Annette was conscience-stricken. What hard thoughts had she. not harbored in regard to him whilst he was in reality ill. "Why did you not tell me this before?" she exclaimed, impressively. "How long is it since you have felt so unwell?" "Not very long," replied the doctor; "the attack came on suddenly after dinner." And he recalled with a sigh how few hours had intervened since he, a comparatively happy man, had seated himself peacefully in his easy chair, with no thought of matrimony agitating his mind. But a great deal may happen in a short space of time. And he now considered matrimony the chief end of man. Before marrying a girl, however, it is necessary to offer one's self, and this the poor doctor found to be the most difficult part of the affair, especially after having in-  volved himself hopelessly in a discussion of diseases. How was he ever now to lead the conversation to love? "I wish I could do something for you," said Annette, gently; " it troubles me to see you suffer, who have saved me S so much suffering."  "Oh, I shall be better presently," said the doctor; "do not be distressed about me." - "I cannot speak to him of my prospects to-night," thought poor Annette, with a sigh of regret. "I must put it off for another time."  '"I have missed a golden opportunity," thought the doctor, despairingly. "Why did I not tell her what she could do for t e--  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8179-00000022"/> 48         ANNETTE; OR; me?"  And then they remained lost in thought, each desiring to -bring forward an engrossing subject, but fearing to disturb the other, until the waiter entered with the tea-tray, which he placed on the table beside the doctor. Annette arose from her seat to make the tea, as- had been her custom for some time past, but, owing either to her nervousness, or the abstraction of her mind, as she raised the heavy silver teapot, her wrist turned, and it was with difficulty that she prevented it from fall- ing to the ground. "Let me help you," said the doctor, coming to her assist- ance. "That teapot is too heavy for you." "Or I am too clumsy to hold it properly," replied Annette, relinquishing it to him. "I fear it must distress you to witness my stupid blunders in tea-making. I have always lived either at a hotel or boarding-house, and never made a cup of tea before I came here." "Quite the reverse, my dear young lady," said the doctor,; "you do it beautifully." And then, seized with a sudden inspiration, he put down the pot in such haste that he" smashed a cup, and sent a couple of teaspoons and a plate under the table; then, taking both her hands in his, exclaimed, "You do it so well, that I wish I could think that you would continue to do it for the rest of your life." "Continue to make tea for the rest of my life!" exclaimed Annette in astonishment. "Oh, why should you wish me to do that?" "Not to make tea generally, my dear," replied the doctor in confusion, "btft to make my tea, you know, mine." He stood before her triumphantly awaiting her answer to what he considered a very neat offer of his heart and hand; imagine then his feeling of blank dismay, when she replied, with a quiet smile, /   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        49 "Ah, I understand you now. Certainly I will do it whilst I am with you, if it gives you pleasure; but I fear my visit to you is drawing to a close." What did she mean? Did she intend to refuse him, or did she not understand what he said? Surely he was explicit enough! How could she make his tea for the rest of her life unless she was his wife! "Perhaps I ought to say something more impassioned," thought the doctor; " but I 'll be blessed if I can think of any- thing just now. Tea and bread and butter are the only things  I can call to mind." But the ice was broken, and he determined to plunge in, although it were head foremost. "My dear young lady, you must not speak of leaving me," he continued; " really, you know, I could not get along with'- out you. You have become as necessary to my comfort as- as - the chairs and tables, you know. Oh, you really must not think of going away." "You are very kind," said Annette, trying to repress a smile, " but I feel that I have trespassed on your goodness long enough. Although you will not admit it, I am quite sure that my presence must make a difference in your bachelor establish- ment." "But I do admit it," said the doctor, turning again to the teapot, and endeavoring to pour out a cup of tea for Annette. "I admit it cheerfully. It makes all the difference in the world, whether I live by myself or you remain here with me." "I have no right to stay," continued Annette, sadly. "I have no possible claim upon your kindness, save that of friend- lessness. " ' "But the kindness will be on your side," said the doctor, helping himself to six lumps of sugar, and Annette to none. 5          D  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8179-00000023"/> 50         ANNETTE; OR, "Here am I, a poor, forlorn old bachelor, with nobody in the world to care for me; my house at sixes and sevens, and cheated by every one I deal with. Now, if you remained here and took charge of things, don't you see how agreeable it would be?" "But why should you be so uncomfortable?" inquired Annette. "You have a housekeeper, have you not? Cannot she take charge of these things?" "No," said the doctor, once more standing before her, and. relinquishing the tea-making. "No housekeeper can take the position I wish to fill. Miss Purden, my house wants a mis- tress. Will you take the situation? Will you stay here as my wife?" This was decidedly effective, and the doctor felt it to be so, indeed; the effect on Annette was overwhelming. To stay as Mrs. Wallis! to stay as his wife! she could scarcely believe her ears. Was he making fun of her? No; one glance into his face convinced her that he was in earnest, and her heart beat so rapidly that she absolutely feared that he would hear it. She sat down upon an ottoman, near at hand, and gazed help- lessly at him. He really wished to marry her; he, a man old enough to be her father! yet, her benefactor; she must not forget that. "Won't you answer me?" said the doctor, in a dismal voice. "You have taken me so by surprise," replied Annette. "I never thought you would marry, and oh, why should you wish to marry me-? how did you ever come to think of it?" "Well, you know," said the doctor, "I really did not see anything else for you to do;, at first, and -" "That will do," said Annette, springing to her feet in indig- nation, all thought of the doctor as a benefactor entirely for- gotten in the humiliating conviction that he proposed marrying her out of pity. "I have no doubt that you mean kindly, 'but   W       THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        5 1 I will not take advantage of your generosity. Whilst I still have health and strength left me wherewith to earn my daily bread, I will not sell myself for a home; " and covering her face with her hands, she sobbed violently. "This is very distressing," said the doctor, reseating himself on the extreme edge of his chair, and clasping his small fat hands together. "I acted for the best, but sometimes our purest motives are misconstrued. I never offered to 'buy' you; you need not, therefore, so indignantly refuse to ' sell' yourself. I only expressed my willingness to marry you, and in doing so was actuated by true philanthropy." "I beg your pardon," said Annette, through her tears. "No doubt I was too violent in my expressions. But it seemed so hard that you could think of nothing for me to do but marry. Is there no honest way for a poor girl to earn a livelihood? Are we born only to marry?" "Oh, dear, no; I hope not," replied the doctor, "or some have decidedly missed their vocation. As for earning a liveli- hood, my dear, as long as your property remains in my hands, you will have enough and to spare." "My property!" said Annette, looking up. "I have some- thing, then? Oh, I am so glad!" "I should have told you all about it before," said the doc- tor, "but I was so undecided in regard to your plans for the future. ' "And at last you thought you would marry me," said Annette, now smiling again, " out of ' pure philanthropy!' and I flew into a passion when you broached the subject. Now that you have seen what a naughty girl I can be, how glad you must feel that I did not accept your offer." "Not so happy as I ought to be," replied the doctor, smil- ing at her in return; " but tell me, now, dear child, what you  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8179-00000024"/> -M X N 1 r , U K , desire me to do for you. It will not answer for you to live by yourself, and you will not, I see, consent to remain here." "My father told me just before he died," replied Annette, ' that he had arranged for my future residence with a friend of my mother's, and to form no plan for myself until I heard from her; but I have not yet received the answer to his letter. " "I fear I have been very remiss," exclaimed the doctor, ris- ing from his seat and going to the desk where he kept his pri- vate papers. "A letter arrived for your father just after he died, and, fearing to distress you, I placed it unopened among his papers.  Here it is," he continued, approaching and handing her Elizabeth's letter, "and I have no doubt it is the one you are looking for." "Thank you," said Annette, taking it from his hand. "If you will allow me, I will take it to my room and read it, as it is getting very late." "Certainly," replied the doctor. "Good-night." CHAPTER VI. FAREWELL. EFT alone again, the doctor resumed his seat, and reflected L  upon the events of the evening. He had made a fool of limself, there was no doubt about that. Why had he not first nquired of Annette what she proposed doing? If that had )een done, she would have mentioned the letter, and there vould have been no further trouble. How easy it all seemed low; and yet he had been so confused at the time. If he had t to do over again - but it was not absolutely necessary to de- ide at once what he would do then, for it was unlikely that   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         53 another girl of seventeen would be put under his charge. Such things rarely happen but once in a lifetime, and he was in his, sixtieth year. He began to realize that his last chance of matrimony had escaped him, and to feel real regret at the thought of losing Annette. The day for love was long since past with him, yet he felt that his life had been brightened by this young girl's presence, and to long more than ever; to secure her for his own. A vigion of Arthur's last days came before him, with a picture of Arthur's gentle nurse, soothing and loving him to the very end. Wifeless, childless, who was there to tend him in his downward path of life, or follow him to the grave with a tear? Alas! the doctor had never felt his loneliness so deeply. "Dear bless my soul!!" exclaimed a shrill voice in his ear, breaking suddenly and alarmingly in upon his reflections. "Did'I ever, in the whole course of my life, see anything like this? Have you a cold, sir, or are you asleep, that you sit steeping your feet in the tea?" "Eh! what?" exclaimed the startled doctor, glancing anx- iously at his feet. "Dear! dear!" he continued, starting up, II I am very sorry; I must have tilted the teapot with my elbow." And in fact this must have been the state of the case, for a beautiful claret-colored stream had been pouring from its spout over his boots, and. from thence on to the floor. Such a sinful waste!" continued Mrs. Beck, reproachfully; "but there's some folks as never thinks of such small things-- their heads is always in the clouds, and haven't no kind of interest in their feets. Well, it makes work for the bootmakers, I suppose, and for poor souls like myself as have to get on their hands and knees and scrub the floors after it is all over. Oh.!! it's hard for the poor, it's hard for the poor to be ground down in this way, and it no fault of theirs."  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8179-00000025"/> 54         ANNETTE; OR, Mrs. Beck was now on her lIobby. From the washing of their hands to the spilling of a cup of tea, all that the " rich" did was, in some inexplicable way, "hard on the poor," and the poor doctor, seeing her already trotting briskly, became convinced that when his further devastations were discovered, she would go at full galop. He therefore beat a retreat, and prudently retired to his own room. a We're all the same in heaven," continued Mrs. Beck, not noticing that she was alone, " although you do treat us like dirt here; and I only hopes that when we get there, you won't be a-scrubbing floors, and I a-riding in my coach!" Here she turned her eyes, filled with Christian forgiveness, in the direction she had last seen the doctor, but the glance fell unheeded upon a mahogany desk, and Mrs. Beck's ire was aroused. "He 's gone!" she exclaimed. "Yes! of course he 's gone! After doing all the mischief, he runs away! Oh, it's very hard on the poor!" Annette, meanwhile, having gained the' seclusion of her room, opened Elizabeth's letter, and eagerly scanned the contents. The wording of it was enigmatical, being, as she was, in igno- rance of the relation in which her father had once stood to Elizabeth . but the mere fact that she was not Utterly alone in the world, but was expected somewhere by some one, was all that she cared for just now, and her heart was filled with thankfulness that it was so. The invitation to Bellevue came at a most opportune time. She did not wish to have another private interview with the doctor, and longed to be off as soon as possible, so she wrote him a note expressing her intention, and, enclosing Elizabeth's letter within, left it upon the office table, where it would meet his eye on the following morning. She did not go down to breakfast until the hall door closed   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.,        55 upon him for the day, and when she at last descended, she found a note lying beside her plate. It ran thus: MY DEAR MSS PURDEN: It is with great regret that I perceive your anxiety to leave my house, particularly as I fear that I have unintentionally caused your decision. Nevertheless, I will put no obstacle in the way of your going, only stipulating that you return here again, if your new home does not prove congenial. My door will ever be open -to you when you choose to claim the shelter of my roof, and- awarm welcome will ever be in waiting for you. I am unfortunately called away on important business to-day, and cannot personally attend to making your arrangements for you, but I have instructed Mrs. Beck to see that your wishes En  are carried out, so that I do not think you will have any trouble. Your sincere friend, OSCAR D. WALLIS. Mrs. Beck did not wait to be summoned by Annette, but appeared of her own accord immediately after breakfast, and- eagerly gave her the information she required in regard to the hour at which the coach left for New York on the following day. "I fear I cannot be ready by that time," said Annette dubiously, looking around upon her unpacked trunks. "Oh, yes, Miss, you can!" exclaimed the energetic house- keeper. "I will help you pack, and we will have every- thing ready in short order." So saying she went to work, with a will, and before night, Annette's arrangements were complete. Worn out by her exertions, she went to bed before the doctor returned, and thus escaped seeing him that night; but the next morning the final interview could no longer be postponed, and so with a heavy heart she took her way to the office to bid him good-bye, before he left the house.  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8179-00000026"/> 56         ANNETTE; OR, She paused at the door to gain courage, and then timidly knocked. "Come i'," said the doctor, and obeying the invitation, she turned the latch and entered. He was standing by the window, looking 'absently into the street, and did not turn immediately, although he divined who had entered, and for what purpose she had come. She crossed the room and stood silently beside him for a few moments, then said timidly: "I am going away now, sir; I have just come to bid you farewell." Eh?" said he, turning slowly towards her, like one in a dream. "Oh, you are going, are you? Well, well, my dear, I suppose you know what is best for you; but if you could have made up your mind to remain with me, I would have taken good care of you." "Indeed, I know that you would," replied Annette, her eyes filling -with tears as she spoke, at the thought of all his kindness to her, and the seeming ingratitude of leaving him, when he so earnestly desired her to remain. "Who knows better than myself how good and kind you can be? but, Doctor, dear Doctor, it would be but a poor return for all that you have done for me, to allow you to bind yourself for life to one so unsuited to you as myself. I know very well the feeling of compassion for my desolate condition that prompted your offer; but I should scorn myself, were I to take advantage of your generosity, and inflict on you the help- less burden of a miserable, silly girl." "' Miserable,' I have no doubt you are, at present," replied the doctor; " but it should be the object of my life to make you less so every day; 'silly,' you are not, and never will be. I frankly confess that the idea of making you my wife would not probably have occurred to me, except under the- circum-   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        57 stances you have mentioned, as it is not usual for men of sixty to marry girls of seventeen; but, apart from that, my dear child, I do love you dearly, and I really think that you would be safer and happier here, in my care, than you will be tossed about in this cold world, like a rudderless craft on a stormy sea. I am even willing to acknowledge that it is still a feeling of compassion that induces me to offer yoti a home; but it is now * compassion for myself--the poor, lonely old man - living here, year after year, by himself, with no companions but his musty folios, until, as dry and withered as his parchments, he shall one day lie down upon his bed to rise no more." "Oh, I beseech you, do not talk thus," said Annette, now sobbing bitterly, " or you will make me hate myself. It does, indeed, seem cruel to leave you all alone -you, my benefac- tor, my more than friend-who took me to your home and heart, a desolate, friendless orphan. Oh, that I could think of some means of repaying the great debt I owe you other than the one you suggest, which is impossible." "But tell me, if you please, why it is impossible?" said the doctor. Annette stepped close to his side, and laying both her hands i on his arm, looked up earnestly into his face. "Doctor," she said, "I cannot marry you, because I do not love you as a girl should love the man she would wed. I could not stand beside you at the altar and vow, before God, to love you, when my guilty heart would tell me that all I had to give was gratitude; neither could I take from your hand my daily. bread, and let you strive and work for me, as men are obliged to do for those dependent on them-nor deem the labor heavy when crowned with love -without their recompense.

Let- me tell you something of it, and lay it well to heart - store it in your memory, and in the day of trouble, think of the old man's words. 'There is a fitful passion that men call love--a varying and uncertain flame- now shooting up like a rocket, now smouldering in the dark; uncertain, changeable, capricious; feeding itself ever with fuel of all kinds, yet never satisfied; yearning ever for the unat- tainable; wearying ever of its daily food. Whether smoulder- ing in the dark or shooting its flames as high as heaven, trust it not, my child; for, sooner or later, it will burn itself out, and the one who has staked her happiness upon it will find herself alone in nature's stillest shades, watching the embers as they die, whilst with them .perish all her fondest dreams and fairest hopes. This is the passion some call love, but there is alloy with it; it is not pure gold, nor will it stand the furnace- heat. But the love that is everlasting is built up, stone upon stone, on a firm foundation of friendship and mutual esteem. It does not spring to life at the touch of a hand, like a flame at the stroke of a match, but grows imperceptibly with the growth of man, and takes such deep hold upon the heart that it were easier to destroy the heart itself than rid it of that love. There is a sermon for you, and my blessing with it. May your life be as unclouded as a May morn; and may you find rest in a love such as I describe, although it erase forever from your heart all memory of the cross old bachelor that raved at youth- ful passion." "Nothing can ever make me forget you, sir,?' faltered An- nette; "and although I   think it right to leave you now, yet should you ever be in trouble, sickness, or sorrow, only say two'words, 'Annette, come! '  and I will return to your side, to assist, nurse, or comfort you, as best I can."

If you really wish to go by this day's coach,  X Miss Purden, it is high time we set off," said an emphatic - voice at the door, easily recognized as Mrs. Beck's, and An- nette and the doctor, with a warm pressure of the hand, hastily bade each other adieu. CHAPTER      V   A RIDE IN A STAGE-CO L,    HURRIED   along at full speed by the energetic house- keeper, who had volunteered to escort her to P rather than she should wait for the doctor, Annette found her. self at length standing hot and breathless before the "Golden Eagle," from whence started the midday coach. Leaving her at the door, Mrs. Beck entered the tavern to ascertain if there were any vacant seats in the coach, and find- ing, to her satisfaction, that there was still one left, she imme- diately bought the ticket which secured it, and proceeded to install her charge therein, although, as yet, the horses had not been brought out of the stable. "You will be more comfortable here, Miss, than standing out in the sun," she said, as she handed Annette her bag, shawl, I and other trappings, "and the waiting-room is really too close to sit in." "But where will you sit?" questioned Annette, as Mrs. Beck showed no intention of following her into the coach.  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8179-00000028"/> 60        ANNETTE; OR, "Me? Oh, dear, I forgot to tell you," said Mrs. Beck, in an embarrassed tone, " there is not another ticket to be had for love or money, so that it is really impossible for me to go with you. I wish it were otherwise, but I can't help it. You need not be troubled, however, at being obliged to travel without a Cc special escort, for the' gentleman from whom I got your ticket told me that he had sold the other three to very respectable people ; in fact, one of them is a minister of the gospel." "Oh, it is of no consequence, if you cannot go," replied Annette, assuming a courageshe was far from possessing. "I have no doubt I shall get along very well by myself, and have a very pleasant journey. Good-bye; I will not keep you stand- ing any longer in the sun, if you will not get into the coach." "I wish I could, indeed," replied Mrs. Beck, " but it seems to be impossible, so I may as well bid you good-bye, now that you are all ready to start. Are you sure you have all you will want on the journey? Where is your lunch-box?" * Annette looked around in all directions, but the missing box was not to be seen. "I do not know where it is," she said, wearily. "I think I must have left it at the house. It don't matter, however; I am never hungry whilst travelling." "Don't matter!" exclaimed Mrs. Beck; "why, you will starve without anything to eat on the way. I will run into the tavern and see if I cannot get something for you," and, despite Annette's remonstrance, she disappeared within the "Golden Eagle."  Before she had been gone many moments, the shout of the stable-boys, as they urged on the horses, fell upon An- nette's ear, together with the fall of the animals' hoofs on the beaten road leading from the stable, and pretty soon four hand- some grays, rounding the corner in good style, drew up before the coach in which she was sitting.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         6I A deafening clamor ensued whilst the horses were being attached, the restive animals, anxious to be gone, pawing and stamping the ground, dogs barking, stable-boys shouting, and, above all, the clear notes of the driver's horn arising to warn the passengers to take their seats. Annette now looked eagerly around to catch a glimpse of her fellow-travellers, with some faint notion of placing herself under - the clergyman's protection, were she able to distinguish him. The first to enter was a dark, surly-looking person, with fierce eyes, deep-sunken in-his head, a quantity of shaggy hair hanging around his not over-clean face, and such a generally leonine appearance, that Annette at once determined that he was not the person she was looking for, and awaited the en- trance of the one behind him. Nothing could be more unclerical, however, than the appear- ance of the next comer. He was a tall and remarkably hand- some young man, apparently not more than two or three and twenty years of age; his fine athletic figure and stately bearing seemingly indicating a soldier's life, whilst his sparkling eyes told of a merry heart and a keen zest for enjoyment. With a sighof disappointment Annette now turned her gaze upon the only remaining passenger, who must surely be the cler- gyman, and with additional interest, as she perceived that he was to occupy the back seat with herself. "Large bodies move slowly;" therefore some moments elapsed before this gentleman reached the coach, and several more before he was ensconced therein to his satisfaction, occu- pying, when settled, certainly two-thirds of the entire seat. Annette gazed at him in utter astonishment, inwardly won- dering how he ever mounted the pulpit stairs when he found it incumbent on him to preach, and how his voice ever had egress from a mouth so nearly lost as his was in a mountain of flesh. , g  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8179-00000029"/> O2         ANNETTE; OR, With a sound resembling both a groan and a snort, he sank powerless back in his seat, and remained wheezing painfully, with closed eyes, for so long a time, that Annette feared he had been seized with apoplexy. The last horn sounded, the crowd dispersed from before the horses, and they were about to start, when Mrs. Beck suddenly appeared at the coach-window, and hastily handing Annette a parcel done up in brown paper, called out to her: "Here are some strawherries-all I could get. I wish it was something more substantial. Good-bye. I hope you will have a pleas-"But the rest of her sentence was lost, for the long whip cracked over the horses' heads, and they bounded off at full speed, followed by the cheers of the crowd, gathered to see them start. Now, this mode of locomotion is, to a lover of horses, about the most delightful one that can be found. But poor Annette was not a lover of horses; on the contrary, she was rather afraid of them, and actually gasped with apprehension as the animals took their headlong course down the main street, causing the coach to roll from side to side, apparently in imminent danger of upsetting. Thus, clinging with both hands to the side of the coach to prevent herself from being thrown from her seat, she passed out of the city scarcely noticing that she was doing so, her alarm was so great; nor did she recover herself entirely until, the open country gained, the horses settled to their work, and came down from their previous gallop to an even round trot. As her fears left her, Annette began to look about with ex- :reme interest. Hitherto, her knowledge of the country had been limited, and the varied scenery through which she was assing was, to her, an entirely new revelation of nature. She remained thus in a  state of quiet enjoyment for some   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       63  time, until the sun, streaming in through the coach window, rendered it necessary to drop the curtain, and then she turned her eyes timidly upon her fellow-travellers, and subjected them ; to a furtive scrutiny.                  . i The dark man was scarcely to be seen, so completely had he obscured all view of his face by receding behind a huge black - stock, and what had perhaps -originally been a white collar, pulling his hat down over his eyes until it nearly rested upon  the stock. The young man had taken a book from his pocket, and was reading with an absorbed air, whilst the gentleman upon the seat beside her now began to give symptoms of re- turning consciousness by dismal groans, and at last, with a pro- longed "Ah!" came to life altogether, and opened his eyes.- He also now looked around upon his companions, and catch- ;  ing Annette's eye as she was sitting lost in wondering contem- plation of him, ejaculated, in a voice absurdly weak and small in comparison with his large frame: "Horrible time of year this to travel-thermometer one  hundred in the shade-dust an inch thick. Ugh! it's disgust- ing. I 'in used up entirely. Eh?"   Annette looked away quickly, and no one paid any attention - i to this remark; but the old gentleman being of a sociable dis-c  position, was in no way put out, but collecting himself for j another effort, addressed himself to his vis-a-vis. ^- v "Ahemi Where might you be going to, sir?" he asked,  in a conciliatory voice; and as no notice was taken of his ques- tion, he repeated it a little louder, but with no better success. - Satisfied now that the gentleman must be hard of hearing, he -  called to his aid all the voice he could command, and shouted out in a shrill treble, for the third time: "Where might you be going to, sir?" and enforced the gentleman's attention by treading upon his foot.

The eyes flashed, the lips parted, and in a deep bass voice he thundered out: "Confound you, sir, do you suppose that I have no feeling, or why did you crush my foot in this way? I shall not be able to walk for a week!" and he raised his foot in his hand as he spoke. "I had no desire to hurt you,"-replied the first speaker. "I only wished to attract your attention." "And what the deuce did you wish to call my attention to?" asked the injured man, angrily. "I asked you where you might be going to, sir, and as you gave me no answer, I thought you might be deaf, and endegv- ored to make you understand that I was speaking to you," skid the stout gentleman urbanely. "Where might I be going?" returned his vis-d-vis. "You trod upon my foot to ask where I might be going? Well, sir, you shall have your answer. I might be going to Southamp- ton/- to Greenland, - to Newgate, - to the Devil! but I 'm noat!" saying which, he disappeared again like a "Jack in a box," and covered himself with his hat. The stout gentleman sighed and gazed absently before him, seemingly reflecting upon the truth of the information he had just received, and very much inclined to doubt a part of it, namely, that his vehement companion was not going to the devil. One thing needed no interpretation, however, and that was the resolute manner in which his vis-d-vis had pulled his hat over his eyes, for it spoke plainly of a determination on his ' part to say no more under any circumstances, so he directed his next attack towards the young gentleman sitting opposite to Annette.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        6; "You seem to have an interesting book, sir," he remarked, and the young man replied: "Yes, thank you, it is interesting," without raising his eyes from it. "You read a good deal?" questioned the stout gentleman. "Whenever I am able to do so uninterruptedly/" replied the young man, with such emphasis on the last word as to force upon the mind of his interlocutor that interruptions were un- pleasant to him. Balked in his second attempt at conversation, the old gen- tleman next turned his attention to Annette, and after regard- ing her benignly for some moments, said: "Going home for the holidays, my dear?" Annette would have given anything she possessed just'then to have been able to think of any form of words whereby she could have answered his question and prevented his asking any more, but nothing occurred to her at the time but a brief--"No, sir," which she uttered in a very timid voice. "Going to visit a friend, perhaps?" said he, questioningly. Annette briefly explained that she was unacquainted with the persons to whose house she was going. "Dear me! that is very strange," commented the old gen- tleman, with increasing interest. "You can't be going for a governess, are you, now?" Annette nervously uttered another "No," and devoutly hoped that he had satisfied his curiosity; but he remained silent only a few moments, and then asked: "Was that your ma that came to the coach-window just as we were going to start?" "Oh, dear, no!" exclaimed Annette, in horror at the sug- gestion of any possible relationship between herself and Mrs. Beck.  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8179-00000031"/> "        ANNETTE; OR, "Ma's quite a different sort of person, eh?" said the old gentleman. "I have no mother," replied Annette, in so sad a voice that the young man opposite to her quickly raised his eyes, and gave her a look full of sympathy and pity. "Just lost her?" continued the old gentleman. "No," said Annette; I' she died when I was born." "Ah!" said the old gentleman, "I thought perhaps you were in black for her." And as Annette made no response to the implied question, he continued:        d "Does your pa live in the city?" Annette could not control her voice sufficiently to speak, and as the question was repeated, she simply shook her head, whilst the tears struggled for outlet from her eyes. "Pa ain't dead, too, I hope?" said the old gentleman, no- ticing that something was wrong with her. Poor Annette resolved desperately to put an end to the con- versation in some way, let it cost her what it might; so she turned towards him, and commanding her voice with difficulty, began: "Yes, sir, I have just lost my-" but she could get no fur- ther in her speech; her voice failed her, and a shower of tears fell from her eyes. "Dear, dear!" ejaculated the old gentleman, "this is very sad! but don't cry, my dear, don't, now! it never does any good--it won't bring him back, you know; and it will spoil your eyes! There! look up, won't you?" he continued ap- -'pealingly, as she continued to sob. "I 'm sorry I set you going so; I didn't mean to do it. Here! put your little head on my shoulder, and let me wipe your eyes, that's a little ducky," and suiting the action to the word, he put his arm around her and attempted to draw her closer to him. /    I '   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        67 "Oh, please, don't!" exclaimed Annette, almost frightened to death. "I am not going to cry any more; I am much bet- ter, I assure you; " and she made an effort to release herself from his encircling arm, but he resisted and endeavored anew to persuade her to lay her head upon his shoulder. Annette repeated her entreaties to be let alone, and the young gentleman opposite to her, who had .been a silent listener up to the present time, now raised his head and said calmly: "'Do you not see, sir, that you are annoying the young lady?" "No, sir, I do not see that at all," replied the stout gentle- t man, indignantly. "Then allow me to open your eyes to the fact," said the young gentleman, "and suggest that you leave her in peace." "What concern is it of yours, sir, if I may make so bold as to ask, whether the lady is annoyed or not? I don't think she asked you to interfere, did she?" returned Annette's tor- mentor. "It is the duty of every true gentleman, sir, to interfere, where a lady's comfort is concerned, whether he, be requested to or not," replied the young man. "And who may you be, sir, if you please, that I am to put up with your interference, and accept your opinions as to the duty of a true gentleman'?" said the stout gentleman, hotly. The young man paused for a moment, and then answered in a clear, calm voice, quite a contrast to the irritable tones of his antagonist,-- "My name is Herbert Wellesley, and by profession I am a clergyman of the Church of England." "Whew!" ejaculated the stout gentleman; " it 's well you told me you were a clergyman -I 'd never have guessed it."

And now that I have introduced myself, will you not return the civility, and tell me your name?" "With all my heart," said the stout gentleman, submitting easily to the charm of Mr. Wellesley's manner. "It may not sound as fine as yourn, but it's a good, honest name for all that, and was my father's afore me. It's Josiah Willks, sir; that's my name." "An excellent name," replied Herbert. "I think I have heard it before. Did not your father live in - in - I have for- gotten the name of the place at this moment?" "Willkesbarra," said Mr. Willks, rubbing his hands together to express his satisfaction. "Yes, you're right, he lived there. The fact is, he settled it, you know; 'twas called after him, 'Willk's barrow,' (that's a kind of hand-car-a thing you push along, you know,) called so because he pushed the place along, so to say, -a-put it through, you know." "Oh, yes, I know," replied Herbert, turning his eyes, full of mischievous merriment, upon Annette's face, and meeting there a look fraught with gratitude for his interference in her behalf, and amusement at his adroit management of the con- versation, so as to turn Mr. Willks' attention from herself. "Do you, indeed?" said that gentleman in reply to Herbert's last remark. "Well, now, I anm surprised. I thought nobody knew about that except those living in the neighborhood, and here you knew it all along. I am glad I spoke of it to you, for you might not have discovered I was one of those Willkses. You see, I don't often mention it. I don't want to be thought proud."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        69 "I think you are perfectly right," returned Herbert, gravely. "I am glad to see you exhibit such a Christian spirit. We l should never exalt ourselves above our fellows." "No, no; that's true," replied Mr. Willks, giving force to his words by a nod of the head. "He that--he that--I believe the Scriptures say something about that; but I can't exactly recall it." "'I believe they do," replied Herbert, struggling to keep his tell-tale mouth from curving into a smile of amusement. "Sup- pose you see if you can find where it is," he continued, -as, drawing a little black book from his pocket, he placed it in the old gentleman's hand. "Oh, don't let me deprive you," began Mr. Willks; but Herbert interrupted him with,- "Not at all; not at all. It gives me great pleasure to lend it to you. I have another book"- saying which, he leaned back in his seat and resumed his reading. Poor Mr. Willks, thrown once again upon his own resources for entertainment, helplessly  turned over the pages of the book he held -which was in reality i a pocket Shakespeare--for some moments; then, sinking back  into his seat, closed both his book and his eyes.   &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8179-00000033"/> 70         ANNETTE; OR, CHAPTER    VIII. THE ACCIDENT. ANNETTE also leaned back in her seat, and endeavored to recover from the astonishing discovery that the young gentleman sitting opposite to her was a clergyman, and to reconcile in her mind his outward appearance with his profes- sional character. She had never seen but one class of clergy- men, namely, those who visited her father - elderly gentlemen, with quiet, unobtrusive manners, who seemingly frowned upon all the pleasures of the world, and delighted in an uncouth attire. She had formed her model upon these, and it seemed impossible to accept Mr. Wellesley as an orthodox minister of the gospel. Truly the contrast was great; and I fear, as Annette peeped from under her long lashes at the stalwart young man before her, with his crisp curly hair, his clearly-cut features, and his dark, soft eyes, the friends of her youth suffered sadly in com- parison, and her heart inclined towards the vanities of the world as displayed in this young man's dress and general air de ban ton. With nothing better to do, she began to speculate upon Mr. Wellesley's tastes and occupations.. That he was well-born she felt sure; and then she pictured him in the performance of a curate's duties, as they had once been described to her by her father. She was smiling quietly to herself, as a vision of this aristocratic-looking gentleman passed before her, distrib- uting flannel garments to the poor old women of the parish, and listening impatiently to their various complaints, when a   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        71 sudden shock sent her over against the side of the coach. It was caused by Mr. Willks, who, having fallen asleep in the pursuit of literature, had, at the first jolt of the coach, been thrown violently against her. "( Are you hurt?" exclaimed Herbert Wellesley, as he thrust Mr. Willks back into his place with no gentle hand. "The weight of that man is enough to have crushed you." "I do not think I an} injured," replied Annette, " although I believed at first that my last hour had come." "He is almost as troublesome asleep as awake," said Herbert. "If he falls on you again, you must come over -to this side; the seats are so wide that we can readily make room for you." "Oh, thank you," said Annette. "I will not put you to so much inconvenience.

Herbert was in doubt for some moments whether to continue his reading or to enter into conversation with Annette; but the fear that she might think him intrusive turned him in favor of the former, and he reopened his book. He did not read very long, however, for a faint sigh reached him, wafted from Annette's lips; and, on glancing at her, she looked so forlorn that he determined to put aside his book, and, risking the imputation of officiousness, endeavor to beguile the tedium of travel. "You must not get weary so soon," he said; " we have not yet completed one-half of our journey." "Have we not?" she asked, wearily. "I am very sorry to hear that, the ride is becoming so tedious."  "Yes, there is not much variety in the scenery here," he replied. "An occasional glimpse of the river is the only enli- vening object. But there will be some relief to the monotony at?  , for the ground there is high and rocky, and the view from some of the hills is quite picturesque." "At?  , did you say?" Annette asked eagerly. "Do you know   anything of??  I am going there to live, and I am so anxious to hear something of it." "I am afraid all the information I can give you will not be worth much," said Herbert, with a smile; "for it is over ten years since I last saw it, and my notions of it are very confused. My parents have lived there for many years, but I have been at college in England, and am only just returning to my native village." \   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        73  -- 'Have you, then, not seen your parents- for ten years?" questioned Annette. "Oh, it is not quite so bad as that," he replied, laugh- ing. "They accompanied me to England when I first en- tered Oxford, and my mother remained with me some four or five years; and since then, she or my father has paid me short visits from time to time." "Are you going to live at??" asked Annette.  No; I am sorry to say that my stay there will be short," replied Herbert. "New York, I believe, is my destina- tion. But tell me something of yourself now, if you are not unwilling, and perhaps I may be able to render you some assistance." Annette's short story was soon told, minus the proposal of the doctor, and the young man listened to it with deep inter- est and sympathy. "And you say you have never even seen the person to whose care your father has committed you?'" said Herbert musingly, when she had ceased speaking. "It seems a great pity that you could not have remained with the doctor, whom you knew so well."  The hot blood mounted to Annette's cheek as she murmured, "Yes, it is a pity; but I thought I had better go to? ." "Oh, of course; as it was your father's last request," replied  Herbert, "you could not help but comply with it. What did ": you say was the lady's name?" "I did not mention it," replied Annette; "indeed, it has , escaped my memory at present; but I will refer to the letter and ascertain. The name of the country-seat is Bellevue," and she took a letter-case from her bag as she spoke, expecting to find Elizabeth's letter therein. No such missive was to be  found, however; and as she sat wondering where she could ;  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8179-00000035"/> 74         ANNETTE; OR, - have mislaid it, she suddenly remembered that the doctor had never returned it. "Oh, what shall I do?" she exclaimed, clasping her hands in distress; "I have left the letter behind me, and I cannot possibly recall the lady's name." "Do not allow yourself to be so much disturbed," said Her- bert, soothingly. "I will not desert you, and my mother will gladly receive you, I know, if you cannot find your friend; but I anticipate no difficulty on that score, as we know the name of the country-seat, and we can 'readily ask the first man we meet at P   the name of its occupant."  "I must confess to being so stupid that that idea did not occur to me," said Annette, with a smile. "I am much obliged to you for suggesting it." "Two heads are better than one," said Herbert, with an answering smile, " although one is a blockhead." The time passed more rapidly for Annette, listening to Her- bert's conversation, for he talked easily and well; it was with much surprise, therefore, that when they next paused to water the horses, she learned that they were now at the last stopping- place between Philadelphia and their destination. The heat of the sun had abated, the horses were fresh, and they were bowling along at a good rate, with a fair prospect of reaching their journey's end betimes, when one of the hind wheels suddenly rolled off from the coach, which of course fell heavily over to that side, causing a promiscuous mingling of the passengers, who found a common resting-place on the prostrate form of Mr. Willks. The poor man groaned and struggled to free himself, but to no purpose, for, as it was difficult at any time for him to rise un- assisted, it was now simply impossible--almost standing on his head, as-he was, and with three persons on top of him.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        75 Herbert was the first one to make his way out of the coach, and immediately lent Annette his aid in extricating herself, after " which, with the assistance of the driver and the other passen- ger, he endeavored to restore Mr. Willks to his equilibrium. This was no easy task, however, owing to his enormous size and the position of the coach, especially as he made no effort 'to help himself, but remained lying where he had fallen, uttering piteous groans. "Lend a hand here, my good fellow," shouted Herbert to a laborer, who was standing, pickaxe in hand, coolly surveying the wreck from the roadside. The man came to their assistance, and together they righted the coach, placing a log under it to keep it in position. Then returning to Mr. Willks, who was still lying upon his face, they rolled him over without difficulty, but what was their consternation on discovering that his face was covered with blood. They drew him forth from the coach and laid him upon the grass, and as he showed no sign of consciousness, they feared he must be seriously injured. The laborer, being well ac- quainted with the locality, volunteered to fetch some water, and Annette, finding herself of no use, wandered back to the coach. When the man returned with the water, Herbert gently washed the stains from Mr. Willks' face, and endeavored to ascertain where he was injured, but neither there nor upon his ' head could he discern even so much as a scratch. The water seemed grateful' to him, however, for he opened his eyes at once, and asked for a drink of it. They tried to get from him some explanation as to the profuse quantity of blood they had found upon his face, but he was as much amazed as themselves, and was inclined to doubt their statement, declaring himself uninjured, beyond a few slight bruises.

"What has happened?" exclaimed Herbert, springing in beside her.  .      r She mutely extended her hand, which was covered with blood. "Good heavens!" said Herbert, "are you also hurt? Why did you not say so before?" "There is nothing the matter with me," replied Annette, "but I accidentally rested my hand on the back seat as I was collecting my parcels, and see! what is in yonder corner? when I drew my hand back it was as you see it." There were stains upon the seat of the coach, and some even upon the floor, and putting his hand into the extreme corner, Herbert drew forth what had once been a brown paper parcel, but was now all that remained of 'Annette's strawherries. A hearty laugh greeted this discovery, and great was Mr. 'Willks' relief to find that the extent of his misfortunes was that he had buried his face in the strawherries. And now they began to look about them for some means of repairing the coach; but a single glance convinced them that the services of a wheelwright were necessary; so the driver mounted one of his horses and returned to the village through which they had just passed in quest of one. Meanwhile the passengers enjoyed the change from the roll- ing coach and dusty roads to the refreshing shade of the wood- land which skirted the road on which they were travelling.   THE -CHRONIC-LES OF BELLEVUE. CHAPTER IX. THE PICNIC. THE   brook from which the water had been brought to recover Mr. Willks ran parallel with the highway, and thither Herbert now led the way, followed by Annette and the unknown passenger, Mr. Willks preferring to remain where he -; was rather than make any unnecessary exertion.. Annette seated herself upon the soft moss with which the wood abounded, and Herbert, opening his lunch-box which he had brought with him, proceeded to spread its contents on the ; i green sward, taking so much pains to render the viands appe-  tizing in appearance, that Annette would have felt it necessary Ad to partake of them even had she not been as hungry as she X I really was.                       :   ," Will your ladyship do me the honor to share my humble I fare?" said Herbert, making her a profound reverence, when ; I he had arranged everything to his satisfaction. "It grieves me that I have nothing better to offer; but my dear old aunt, who : prepared my luncheon this morning, did not foresee that I -:; should entertain so fair a lady ere nightfall."     : "- It will give me great pleasure so to do," said Annette, with a smile, "as my 'ladyship' is very hungry, and the ill-fated -  strawherries were my only resource."    :1 "Then allow me to fielp you to something without loss of time," replied Herbert, "lest the horn sound a recall before -; ; we have finished;" saying which he threw himself upon the ;  ground beside her, and, giving her the only plate, helped her :-  to the best his box contained.          . 7*              *    -      -  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8179-00000037"/> 78         ANNETTE; OR, "This is altogether wrong," exclaimed Annette, perceiving that he ate nothing himself. I must not be the only one to eat, nor must I enjoy the sole possession of your only plate." "You, as queen of this feast, have a right to all that pertains to it," answered Herbert, gallantly; "but if you are troubled with conscientious scruples, satisfy them by allowing me to share the plate with you in true picnic style." "I think thai is only fair," replied Annette, as she placed the plate between them. Their travelling companion, who had been standing at some little distance from them, now approached, and Herbert invited him pleasantly to join them. !"Why on earth did you not choose a better place to dine?" he growled out in reply. "Such a damp hole as this is- full of snails, frogs, and every kind of abomination." "We do not find it unpleasantly damp," replied Herbert, good-humoredly, "and as for snails and frogs, I consider them quite a luxury, as I have tasted none since I left France." "'Tasted none!" ejaculated' the stranger. "Do you mean to tell me, sir, that they really eat such things in France?" "Why, dear sir," replied Herbert, "in France, 'ignorance' in regard to one's food is really ' bliss,' and the folly of wisdom in such matters is made apparent by a little Story I heard once from the lips of an unhappy victim of misplaced curiosity. Sit down, sir, and I will relate it. "A friend of mine was breakfasting in a French caf6 one morning, and whilst. eating a remarkably fine sausage, his teeth encountered a hard substance which he found it impossible to masticate. On examination it proved to be a metal button. Inspired with curiosity, he procured the sausage-maker's address, and proceeded to the place, armed with the button, to investi- gate his method of making sausages.

"Placing a five-franc piece in her hand, my friend followed her to the mincing-room, and examined the machinery in operation. The meat was thrown into a sort of hopper, and when cut fine, fell through into a large tub, placed beneath for the purpose of receiving it. "' Is this kept covered?' inquired my friend, pointing to the hopper. "iNon! Monsieur, non!' replied his guide, ' e n'est pas necessaire. ' "'But it is very necessary,' replied my friend, indignantly, 'to prevent any foreign substance from falling in,' and he pro- : duced the-button to enforce his argument.

"What is the matter?" he inquired; "surely you are not done? Are you apprehensive of discovering a ' button'?" "I am not troubled by any such fear," replied Annette, laughing, "but I have lunched heartily, thank you, and my hunger is quite satisfied." "If that is the case," said Herbert, "I will pack up my lunch-box, that all may be in readiness to start." He busied himself accordingly, washing plate, knife, fork anid glass in the brook; after which he put them safely in their several places. Meanwhile the stranger had wandered off; and Annette remained pensively regarding Herbert. "And now, fair lady," he said, as, having completed all his arrangements, he -threw himself upon the soft turf at her side, "may I venture to ask the subject of your thoughts?" Annette started and colored deeply, then, after a moment's reflection, answered quietly: "I was thinking of you." "That is honestly spoken," said Herbeit, laughing. "I sur- mised as much from the expression of your face, but I did not think you would confess it. Now, tell me as honestly what you were thinking of me, for my curiosity is too great to be restrained." "I pray you keep it in subjection," replied Annette, de- murely, "for you have just mentioned how unfortunate -it is to be over-curious." "I grant you that, in ynost cases," replied Herbert, " but in this instance I feel it necessary to push my inquiries. What were you'thinking of me, Miss Purden?" "Perhaps I was mentally agreeing with Mr. Willks," she replied, " that you were not likely to be taken for a clergyman."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        8l Herbert colored in his turn, and, looking down upon the ground, employed himself for the next few moments in pulling up a handful of grass. "And yet I am a clergyman," he said, at length, " and think that there is no nobler profession on earth, although you judge differently of me."  "Oh, I have no reason to judge you at all," Annette replied, quickly. "I do not know you well enough to understand your feelings; but you are so unlike any clergyman I have ever met, that I could not help wondering whether you were one through necessity or inclination." "Not through necessity, certainly," replied'Herbert, "and at the time I was ordained, I firmly believed my heart to be thoroughly in my work. "He paused, and Annette said, gently: "Have you had reason since that time to believe yourself mistaken?"  "Not exactly," he replied. "I still think my profession the highest on earth; but, Miss Purden, it is very difficult for : me to make up my, mind to give up the world as entirely as I i shall be expected to, owing to the prejudices of the day. I am a strong, hearty fellow, full of animal life and spirits, which  J seek vent constantly, as you have seen, in what I think to be J very innocent safety-valves-namely, harmless jests, light con- i versation, and active exercise.

I  "But surely no one can object to your being happy and  merry?" said Annette.  I i"Well, I suppose not," said Herbert, laughing; " but they I wish me to be happy in their way, and that I cannot do.

I know very well what is before me, on my return home, for my father is very strict in his notions, and looks with horror upon a 'jockey clergyman,' as he terms one fond of horses and the hounds. I am very fond of horses, and am never so well pleased as when I am seated upon a thorough-bred animal, scouring along the highways, or leaping ditches and fences, following the hounds; nor can I see what wrong there is in thus loving and using the good Creator's gifts. I love to worship God in nature; nor do I see any reason why religion should make a man gloomy." "But must we necessarily be gloomy because we do not ' ride to hounds '?" asked Annette, with a smile. "My father was a very light-hearted, happy man, and I am quite sure that he never mounted a horse in his life, if he could help it." "No, it is not a necessary sequence," replied Herbert, " but there are many other innocent amusements besides those I have stated, that are considered incompatible with a Christian pro- fession."  "I know a number of clergymen who keep fine horses," said Annette, " and I have never heard any objection made to it. I think you have not properly understood the prejudice, which is not against a love of animate or inanimate nature, but against the immoderate indulgence of the same." "Perhaps you are right," replied Herbert, " but it seems to me-" "That the horn is blowing," said Annette, laughingly com- pleting his sentence, and springing to her feet. "So it is," said Herbert, rising also, and picking up his lunch-box. "Let us make haste, or they may forget us, and start before we reach the coach." 'The remainder of the journey was rapidly performed, but the   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         83 delay occasioned by the accident had been considerable, so that it was quite dark before they entered the main street at P  . "Here we are!" exclaimed Herbert, as the lights from the old tavern shone cheerily out upon the road, "and I am sure- you must be very glad that our tedious journey is at an end." But Annette felt that she was not so glad as might have been expected. Herbert had been very kind to her during the journey, and she had partially forgotten her forlorn condition in the excitement of the day, but now the sense of her position came back to her in full force, and -she realized that she was about to intrude upon a perfect stranger, unexpectedly, at an unseasonable hour, and without the letter that she had looked  upon as her introduction. " c "Are you not very much pleased?" repeated Herbert, 'at a loss to understand her silence. "Pleased?" she repeated, sadly. "What cause have I for k pleasure? It is natural that you should be happy, who are re- turning home to father, mother, friends and kindred; but for ! me, who, alas! am so friendless, what is there in life to rejoice at?" Her voice faltered as she uttered these words, and Herbert :! felt his heart moved strangely at her distress.   "Do not say friendless, Miss Purden," he said, gently, "for if you will permit it, I shall be only too happy to be re- n. . garded as your friend."  He paused, awaiting her response, but Annette made none. ; i She felt abashed at having expressed herself so frankly as she 'had done to a stranger, and relapsed into silence. Herbert, respecting her feelings, said nothing until the coach '  drew up before the tavern, then stepping out, he extended his I hand to her, saying: , .                       , .  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8179-00000040"/> $4         ANNETTE; OR, "Let me help, you out, and then I will make all the neces- sary inquiries." "You are very kind," said Annette, "to take so much trouble for a stranger. I do not like to trespass on your time in this way; your friends will be impatient at your delay." "That is not likely, " replied Herbert, "as they do not expect me before next week. My time, therefore, is at your service, and I only wish I had something more valuable to offer you." She extended her hand to him without further demur, and, springing to the ground, suffered herself to be led by him through the crowd gathered around the coach door. CHAPTER X. BELLEVUE ,AT LAST. "NOW," said Herbert, as they made their way to the tavern, our first step must be to secure a guide; for, although I am pretty well acquainted with the country, and could prob- ably find my own way to Bellevue by daylight, I do not choose to run the risk of losing you in some of these dark ldnes. Here is a respectable looking fellow upon the tavern-steps; wait a moment until I speak to him. My good fellow," he continued, approaching the man, who was leaning idly against the door- post, reading his paper by the light of the lamp within, "will you be so good as to direct us to Bellevue?" "To  Bellevue?" repeated the person addressed, in a tone of surprise. "What do you want at Bellevue?"  But on raising his eyes they fell upon Annette, who was standing full in the light from the doorway. -Instantly removing his hat, he   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       85 said, "I beg pardon. Certainly, I will show you the way; I am going in the same direction;" and folding his paper, he joined  the    side-walk. Herbert soon perceived that he was walking with a gentle- man, and regretted the familiarity of his address, but their guide seemed in no way desirous of taking advantage of it, for he maintained an absolute silence. "Can you tell me the name of the present owner of Belle- vue?" asked Herbert, at length. "I believe his name is Westhrooke," replied their guide. "His name!" ejaculated Herbert. "I thought, Miss Pur- den, that you told me the occupant was a lady?" 'So I did," replied Annette. "I am quite sure the letter I mislaid was signed with a lady's name, and that it was not Westhrooke." "Mr. Westhrooke has a sister living with him," said their guide: " perhaps she is the lady to, whom you allude." "She must be the one," said Herbert. "What is her name?"                        - "Miss Elizabeth Mordaunt," replied the gentleman. "That is the name!" exclaimed Annette, in delight. "Oh, p I am so glad I have remembered it." ' "It is to be sincerely hoped that she has not forgotten yours as completely as you did hers," said Herbert, with a laugh. "If you think there is any danger, I had better go in and introduce you." "If you only could," said Annette; "I am terribly fright- ened." Their guide now paused at the head of a dark lane. "This is the direct road," he said, pointing down it. "I do not : think you will have any further need of my services, for you ' cannot miss your way unless you climb over a fence." 8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8179-00000041"/> 86         ANNETTE; OR, "Which we will promise not to do," said Herbert, laugh- ing. "Good-evening, sir; we are very much obliged to you for your kindness." "Not at all," said the stranger, slightly raising his hat and moving on. "That is a gentleman," said Herbert to Annette as they proceeded down the lane, arm in arm. "That is Miss Annette Purden," said the stranger as he moved away. "Blushing sixteen! and with a ready-made beau. I shall not have to provide her with one. For this and all other blessings, the Lord make us truly thankful." "We have now overcome our worst difficulty,' said Her- bert to Annette, "the one that seemed, but a short time since, insurmountable." "Yes," replied Annette, " owing to your kindness. What should I have done without you?" "It is unnecessary to think of that," said Herbert, "for I am happy to say that you are not obliged to 'do without me,' and it gives me the greatest pleasure to find myself of use. It is such a novelty. You cannot think what a useless fellow I am generally." "You can turn over a new leaf from to-night, then," said Annette, laughing, "'now that you have found how pleasant it is to do good to your fellow-creatures." "Drop the 's' to that word," replied Herbert, "and you will make my reformation perfect; for there is one ' fellow- creature' to whom I would joyfully 'do good' for the rest of my life. But here we are within a few steps of a house, which must, I presume, be Bellevue. You must not be frightened now; take courage and hope for the best. You cannot tell what happiness may await you at yonder house. There you may find a secofnd home, and a friend to love you so dearly   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         87  that to-night's fears and anxieties will fade into oblivion. You must not be so nervous," he added, as, on nearing the house, v he felt the little hand resting on his arm shaking like an aspen leaf.        '                  :- "I cannot help it," said Annette, piteously. "Oh, what will Miss Mordaunt think of me, arriving alone so late in the evening?" "Surely you do not consider yourself to be alone?" said Herbert, laughing. "You are not very complimentary; until now, I have always thought myself somebody." "But I started from Philadelphia alone," replied Annette, "and without her being aware of the fact; and it is only through your kindness that I am not now wandering helplessly about the country, actually and figuratively in the dark." "I must confess," said Herbert, " that I do not quite under- stand why you did not let Miss Mordaunt know that you were coming to-night; it would have been decidedly the better plan; but as you did not, it cannot now be helped; and we have only to give her a simple statement of facts, and trust to her putting - a proper construction upon them." : "We  r " repeated Annette, eagerly. "Oh, are you going in .. with me?"                       - :^ "Yes," replied Herbert, gaily, "I certainly shall go in with- -. you, if it were only to certify the fact that I am surrendering . i: you into the hands of a respectable Englishwoman, and not an . ogress who will devour you for her supper.  "Our situation is becoming very interesting," he added, as she seemed disinclined to talk. "Behold! we are approaching an unknown castle -the dark walls loom before us. Within -:-' may be cyclops, dragons, giants, monsters of every descrip- ?  tion, but a noble courage fills our souls; we- are in search of a : home and friends, mischievously stolen by a wicked fairy from ;  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8179-00000042"/> 88         ANNETT-E; OR, a poor young girl, and supposed to be hidden here. Thus, we approach intrepidly, and knock upon the door. Rap! rap! rap! demanding that it be opened unto us, and our lost posses- sions restored." Suiting the action to the' word, Herbert had given three sonorous blows with the knocker, and as he ceased speaking, they heard a voice within calling: "Betsy! Betsy! are you asleep? don't you hear some one knocking at the hall door?" "Lord bless my soul! I'se a comin'!" replied a cracked voice somewhere in the distance. "Asleep, did yer say? must ha' bin dead, if I didn't heer that knockin'. I 'se a comin'! I'se a comin', honey! but dis chile's legs ain't so young as dey used to was, and dey can't come no faster, dat's a fact." By this time Betsy had reached the door, and, turning the latch, threw it open, revealing to our travellers' gaze an old colored woman on a very indistinct background, owing to the feeble light within the hall, shed by a solitary lamp. "Is this ' Bellevue House '?" inquired Herbert. "Yes, sah ; dat's de name of dis yer place," responded Betsy. "Is Miss Mordaunt at home?" he asked. "Yes, sah," replied she. "Just walk right in dar. She's a sittin' by de winder, a talkin' to herself," and she pointed to an open door to their right. Herbert and Annette proceeded in the direction indicated by Betsy, and found themselves in a long room, the ceiling of which was very low, and they with difficulty distinguished a figure sitting by an open window, in the extreme end of it, over- looking the garden. Elizabeth had chosen that spot this evening in which to ruminate on events, past, present, and' to come. Ever since the news of Arthur's death she had been anxiously awaiting some intelligence regarding his orphaned -daughter, but none had   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        8   '9 come. Her heart had warmed towards her false lover, now   i that he had paid the forfeit for his sins with his life, and she : had held him in tender remembrance all the afternoon. Whilst it was still light enough to read, she had scanned his last letter : over and over, palliating his'faults and excusing his weakness; then, as the twilight deepened, and the rosy tints died out one by one in the skies, and the perfume of the roses came in to her borne on the evening breeze, thoughts of her treacherous. friend stole into her mind, and memory, overleaping the lapse : of time, carried her back to another garden with the same  sweet, faint perfume hovering around; and there arose the picture- of a fair young girl, clinging to her lover's arm, with upraised face and gentle, dove-like eyes resting upon his face in earnest love. Ah, should she never forget that scene? it seemed not. They might bury Alma five fathoms deep, yet would Elizabeth . ; see those eyes that had betrayed her. A slight rustling noise aroused Elizabeth from her reverie, : and turning to ascertain what it was, her eyes fell upon Annette, = standing directly in the streak of light shed into the room by . . the hall lamp.                       - Elizabeth was no believer in ghosts, yet now her heart beat rapidly, and a chill crept through her veins; for there, before : her, stood the friend of her youth, who had been in her grave --l these seventeen years; and in the shadow behind her stood -: another figure, perhaps Arthur's. Had they come together from: . the grave to reprove her for her harsh judgment of the dead? , These and other thoughts of a similar nature rushed con-  fusedly through her bewildered mind, during the awkward ,   pause that followed the entrance of our travellers into the rbom, ; for Herbert remained silent, thinking it best to allow Annette 'to X speak for herself, which she was much too agitated to do at once. i 8*j                       -  A  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8179-00000043"/>  9        ANNETTE; OR, As the silence continued, Elizabeth became absolutely terri- fied, and cried, in a voice hoarse from excitement, to Betsy to bring the lamp into the room; but, to Elizabeth's surprise, even its bright light did not dispel the vision, which now timidly approached and held out its hand, a very piteous looking ghost, evidently more terrified than terrifying. The single word "Alma!" fell from Elizabeth's parted lips, as she gazed in wonder upon the approaching figure. "No, not Alma," said Annette, gently, "that was my mother's name. Mine is Annette, but my father called me Netta." "And your father's name was-" but Elizabeth could not complete the sentence, so entirely was she overcome by her con- flicting emotions. "My father's name was Arthur Purden," said Annette, en- deavoring to preserve her self-control. "He thought you would have remembered him," she continued, in tremulous tones, "and just before he died he -told me I would find a home with you. Your answer to his letter only reached me a few days since, and I have come directly on to you as he bade me." Annette could- no longer preserve her equanimity; a flood of tears followed her last words. Elizabeth's strange greeting had destroyed every hope she had possessed of finding in her a sympathizing friend, and she recalled her father's enigmatical words, that the resemblance she bore to her mother might be a drawhack to her happiness. Elizabeth stood motionless as a statue, looking at the weep- ing girl. She felt vaguely that common kindness required her to comfort her, but her heart felt hard as granite, and her lips remained- firmly closed. If Arthur's child had but borne a resemblance to himself, she felt she could have taken her to her heart, but her soul revolted at receiving into her home this   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        91 living image of the woman who had wronged her, to stab her daily with those soft blue eyes, which seemed forever to be saying, "See, I have stolen his heart from you." Herbert, a silent spectator of this scene, felt his indignation rise at Miss Mdrdaunt's cold reception of the charge left her by a dying man -one, also, who had called himself her friend; turning, therefore, to her, he said: "Excuse me, madam, if I -take the liberty of reminding you that this poor child is in need of rest. Her nervous system has been very much shaken, and we have had a very fatiguing jour- ney; our coach met with an accident, and the delay this occa- sioned has made our arrival at your house much later than we should have desired. This has distressed Miss Purden very much; she fears she shall incommode you by so sudden an arri-  val so late in the evening." "She need give herself no uneasiness on that account," said Elizabeth, with difficulty forcing herself to speak; " my house, : I am happy to say, is always in readiness to receive guests. : Did you bring the young lady from the city, sir? Are you Dr.  Wallis?"  "My name is Wellesley," replied Herbert, slightly bowing. : "Miss Purden's escort disappointed her at the last moment, ,  and finding, on her arrival here, that she was unacquainted  with this part of the country, I took the liberty of escorting her : v hither."         '-:-l; "We are much obliged to you for your trouble," said Eli za-  beth, recovering her good manners. "Be seated, I pray you, and I will order some. refreshments. You also must be ,.  ? fatigued."                  i "Thank you," replied Herbert, " you are very kind; but I  fear I must decline your offered hospitality this evening, asi I ; have not yet seen my parents; but, if you will permit me,- I  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8179-00000044"/> - 92        ANNETTE;    OR, will 'give myself the pleasure of calling on you to-morrow, to inquire after Miss Purden's health." "We shall be glad to see you at any time," said Elizabeth, with frigid civility, holding her hand out stiffly to bid him good-bye. "Good-night," said Herbert, turning to Annette. "Good-bye," replied she, raising her eyes to his,- with a piteous glance of farewell. "I say it is only good-nieht,"' he replied, pressing her hand and smiling, " for I shall see you to-morrow morning. Sleep well and be fresh when I come;" saying which, he turned and left the room. "Shall I show you your room?" said Elizabeth to'Annette, as the hall-door closed upon Herbert. "If you please," faltered Annette; "I am very tired." Elizabeth -took up a candlestick from the table, and having lighted the candle, preceded Annette out of the room, up the broad stairway, and along the' corridor, ushering her at length into the little room that had been prepared for her. "I hope you will be contented here," she said, placing the candlestick upon a small table near the bed, upon which lay a large Bible. ";I have done my best to make you comfortable, but as I do riot know your tastes or habits, no doubt I have failed in my purpose. " "Do not trouble yourselfl on my account,".said Annette. "I am not hard to please under any circumstances, and as it is now, I am too grateful for the shelter you afford me to be criti- cal. I only hope my residence here will not put you to any inconvenience." "There is no reason why it should," said Elizabeth, quietly. "There is room enough in the world for each of us to go her own way without troubling the other. I think," she continued, "that you had better not come down again this evening; it is   THE CHRONICgLES OF BELLEVUE.       93 late, and you are fatigued. Make yourself comfortable, and I will send your supper to you."  "Oh, don't trouble yourself," exclaimed Annette; I am   not at all hungry." "Young ladies never are," said Elizabeth, with a sniff of  contempt, as she left the room. Soon after Betsy tapped at the door with the tray, and  although Annette thought at first that she could not eat a mor- : sel, she soon found out that she was really very hungry, and, making a good supper, she went to bed, and fell asleep almost : as soon as her head touched the pillow. On going down stairs Elizabeth discovered Walter smoking i upon the porch, and bent her steps in that direction to inform :: him of Annette's arrival.

"I have not had much opportunity to form an opinion," said, Elizabeth, sharply, "as she has done nothing but cry ever since she arrived." "Cry!" ejaculated Walter; "that is a pleasant lookout for the future. Do you suppose she intends to keep it up all the time? If so, I shall run away, for I cannot endure a Niobe."

As Elizabeth was about retiring for the night, she paused at Annette's door; then, opening it softly, stole in to her bed- ?' side.

"LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP." "ONG and deep were Annette's slumbers on this her first night at Bellevue, and the sun was high in the heavens the next morning ere she opened her eyes. When at length she awoke, she looked around her in bewil- derment, and was tempted to believe herself still dreaming. The room in which she found herself was small and very plainly furnished, extreme cleanliness being its only recommendation. There was an unfamiliarity about the stiff, orderly furniture, the blank, white walls, and the empty shelves, that strangely affected Annette, and made her appreciate more highly the kind doctor's endeavors to make her comfortable whilst with him. There her room had been furnished with everything that he could think of as likely to please her eye and divert her mind - bright pictures hung upon the walls; low easy chairs in- vited the occupant to rest; flowers blossomed in the wide window seats, or filled the mantel vases, whilst from every shelf looked down choice volumes, with which to beguile the tedious hours. With a sigh she arose from her bed and dressed herself, wondering the while how she would be able to support- life in this uncongenial spot; but when, her toilet being completed, she pulled aside the curtain from before the window, and gazed for the first time upon a country landscape, lit up by the morn- ing sun, drank in the cool, refreshing breeze, and listened to the never ceasing twitter of the birds among the branches of the tall old trees, her heart revived, and she began to think that, perhaps, after all, she might be happy here. , I   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        97 Down the broad staircase she wandered, and seeing no one, 'i determined to brace her spirits by a short stroll- before break- fast; but alas! as she reached the hall door, an insurmountable  objection arose to this innocent desire, in the form of a large ^- -dog, which confronted her as she would have left the house. 1 Annette, I am sorry to say, was a great coward, and this. animal struck terror to her soul.              : His eyes seemed to fix themselves upon her with a savage  ; stare-his ponderous jaw seemed formed for the mastication of ;: slender, delicate bones like her own, and the gentle wagging of his tail, with which poor Lion tried to welcome her, ap- peared, to her inflamed imagination, the lashing of that ap- Ii pendage by the king of beasts just before he springs upon his ' prey.                            . For a few moments she stood undecided as to wlhich way she i: should flee, or whether to flee at all; she had heard thatan assump-  tion of courage sometimes kept the most savage beasts at bay;  but Lion settled the question by crossing the "Rubicon"   : (namely, the door-silD, and endeavored to solicit her caresses. { Annette drew back in alarm, and hastened to take refuge in : the library, the door of which stood open, on the left side of - .i the hall. The animal's suspicions were aroused, however, by her flight, arid he followed her thither, protesting with a fierce growl against her intrusion upon ground hitherto the particular property of his master.                   - Perceiving him close behind her, Annette fled precipitately ;- towards the window, and, urged on by her terror, placed her hands upon the ledge and sprang out. It was an easy thing to do, for the room was on the ground : floor, and the window very low, but, alas! she had not known  of the cellar window directly underneath, into which she un- wittingly dropped. 9          O *  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8179-00000047"/> 98         ANNETTE,' OR, She sustained no serious injury by her fall, but she soon dis- covered that it was easier to jump-into than to jump out of? cellar. It seemed, at first sight, quite a simple thing to do, but it proved quite otherwise when attempted, for she could find no foothold, and to spring, unaided, to nearly her own height was impossible. To add to her discomfort, the dog mounted guard upon the window-sill, and barked loudly to attract the attention of the household. Very soon footsteps were heard approaching the library, and a deep voice called : "Lion! Lion! what the deuce is the matter with you? What are you about, sir, up on the window-sill? Down with you, this moment." But Lidn, although he wagged his tail at the sight of his master, did not show any intention of obeying his orders, but stood his ground, looking -occasionally out of the window to ascertain that Annette had not run away. "What have you got there?" continued Walter, noticing the watchful expression of his eyes. "A rabbit, I suppose, or a cat. Get down, you rascal, and let me see.'" Lion obeyed now, with alacrity, and Walter, leaning out of the window, rested his astonished eyes upon Annette's -brown head, some two feet below him. "By Jove!" he ejaculated. And as she, overcome with em- barrassment, offered no explanation of her situation, he sprang out in his turn, taking care, however, to clear the cellar window. "You seem to have met with an accident," he said, with difficulty suppressing a laugh. "How can I help you?" "Oh, if you would only tell me how I can get out of this place!" said Annette, in a-distressed voice.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       99 "I will, with pleasure," said Walter, "if you will be so kind as to tell me how you ever got into it." "The dog followed me to the window, and I was so frightened that I jumped out without looking where I was going," replied Annette. "Lion! Lion! I am surprised at your uncourteous behavior, sir," said Walter, laughing. "In what way can I make amends for it, Miss Purden?" "He shall be quite forgiven if you will only help me to get out," reiterated Annette. ( "But how is that to be done?" questioned Walter. "You cannot walk up a perpendicular wall like a fly. Were you ever mounted on a horse by the hand?." No, Annette had never mounted a horse in that way. "Let me teach you how it is done, then," said Walter, jumping down to her level. "Place your right foot upon my hand, your left remaining on the ground, your hands upon, the ^ topmost row of bricks. That is well. Now, when I have counted three, spring upon the right foot,-and with the extra force that my hand will add, you will have no difficulty in getting out." "One, two, three," counted Walter, and endeavored to lift her up, but, agitated and confused, she forgot to spring, and con- :,.- sequently the effort was a failure.            .?j "Now, again," said Walter, "and be sure that you spring i ; in time. One, two"-up went Annette in the air, deter- -. mined not to be too late this time, but unfortunately Walter was unprepared for her sudden ascent before he had counted : -^ "three," and, his wrist turning, she came to the ground again '1 with such force as to cause her pain, and to excite a fear lest . she had sprained her ankle.

You are so slight I can easily do it, and I see no- other way of releasing you from captivity." Annette, mortified at her failures, submitted without a word of remonstrance, and Walter, placing his hands around her waist, lifted her as easily as one would a child to a sufficient height to enable her to scramble out upon the grass. With an active spring he followed and stood beside her. "Will you take my arm?" he asked.   "I fear you have sprained your ankle." "Oh, no," replied Annette, with cheeks as red as roses, "it does not hurt me much now; I only sprained it slightly. I am sorry I was so stupid, and gave you so much trouble." "Let us hasten in to breakfast, then," replied Walter, " or my sister will be alarmed at our absence," and he led the way towards the house. Lion met them at the door, and Annette shrank, instinctively, behind Walter, as they entered. "Are you really afraid of poor old Lion?" asked Walter, in great amazement. "I did not suppose any one could fear such an antediluvian. He will not bite, I can assure you, for he lost his last tooth in the early spring," and Walter laughed so heartily, that he called a smile to Annette's face, although she did not yet feel perfectly safe. "Do not let Elizabethl know of your fears," he continued, "or she will be very indignant. She has no patience with timid persons, and considers all appearance of timidity, affectation." "I wish it was," said' Annette, "for then there would be some hope of overcoming it; but fear is too real to be easily van- quished. Oh, look at my dress," she exclaimed, suddenly, as her eyes rested upon it. So beautifully white when she had jumped   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.

"I am afraid you will have to explain where you have been," said Walter, with a smile, 'if you come to the breakfast- table as you are. Would it not be better to make a fresh toilet?" "I think it would," replied Annette. "It will not take me long to change my dress, and -you will not mention having met me to Miss Mordaunt?" she added, beseechingly. "No, I will keep your secret," replied Walter, proceeding towards the breakfast-room as she disappeared up the stairs. Elizabeth was seated at the table when he entered, and, glancing up at him, she uttered a brief ' good-morning," and continued Ito pour out the coffee. { Walter, accustomed to her scanty manners, seated himself opposite to her in silence, and proceeded scientifically to carve the fowl before him. "Betsy!" called Elizabeth, after a short interval of silence. "Yes, missus, I'se a comin'," replied Betsy, slowly making her way from the kitchen. "Tell Miss Purden that we are waiting breakfast for her," said Elizabeth. "Are we?" said Walter, in a tone of inquiry, gazing con- templatively at Elizabeth, who was eating so rapidly that the viands before her disappeared as if by magic. "And why should we?" she demanded, angrily. "Are all our arrangements and habits to be disturbed, because a fine young lady cannot get out of her bed before the day is half over?"                            , " "Oh, no," replied Walter, "let us eat our breakfast. by all " means; perhaps she will be up in time for dinner."   .  o "If she is not," began Elizabeth, but checked herself as  - x .  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8179-00000049"/> 102        ANNETTE;' OR, the door opened and Annette entered, looking so fresh and lovely that her heart instinctively softened towards her, and she listened to her excuses with a more benignant expression than usual. "We will excuse your being late this morning, my dear," she said, "but I trust you will make it a rule, henceforth, to be dressed in time for prayers, which are read half an hour before breakfast. Now, let me introduce my brother to you, Mr. Westhrooke; Walter, this is Miss Purden." Annette's flushed cheeks and nervous manner, to an observant mind, would have awakened suspicions of a previous acquaint- ance with the gentleman ; but Walter received the introduction in an unembarrassed manner, rising slightly from his chair, and bestowing such a stately inclination of the head upon her, that she almost disbelieved her senses, and felt disposed to consider this her first introduction to the master of Bellevue. There was almost total silence during the breakfast, as might have been expected from the incongruity}of the persons as- sembled at it, but at its close Elizabeth turned to Annette with a question as to how she would wish to employ herself through the day. "If you would like to read," she continued, "the library contains a great many improving volumes, and for my part, I consider reading light books a sinful waste of time, that might otherwise be given to the regenerating of our fellow-creatures." Annette, who had been roused from a reverie, in which she had been comparing Walter with Herbert, very much to the disadvantage of the former, hastened to assure Elizabeth that she was desirous to occupy herself according to her wishes, and trusted she would describe her duties to her frankly. Elizabeth was quite pleased to find her so pliant, and imme- diately stated her views as to the "chief end of woman,"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        103 expressing a wish that if Annette were in earnest, she -would accompany her through the pursuits of the day, and be in- structed therein. "In the first place, my dear, we will proceed to the kitchen," said Elizabeth, as she led the- way from the breakfast-room; "for 'housekeeping' is the primary element of a consistent Christian education." Annette heard this observation with surprise, but followed her meekly into these hitherto unexplored regions. Poor Annette! that first day in the kitchen she' never forgot. The number of pots and pans, whose names she constantly mis- called ; the beef that she mistook for mutton; the mutton she mistook for veal; the jelly that she carefully stirred, thereby ruining it forever, and the milk she forgot to stir, thereby' allowing it to burn. In fact, her blunders were so numerous and lamentable, that Elizabeth's patience was severely tried, and gave way altogether, when she completed her performances by straining the soup into the sink, ahd carefully preserving the grounds left in the strainer. This last blow was too much for Elizabeth. "Any fool would have known better!" she exclaimed, as she snatched the strainer from Annette's hand. "All the stock for the week lost, through your stupidity." "I am very sorry," faltered Annette. "I did not under- stand."                     X "Your sorrow won't bring back my soup," said Elizabeth, "and if there is anything you understand better than cooking, do go and do it." Thus adjured, Annette sadly turned her back upon the kitchen, and retreated to .the library, where the cool atmosphere and subdued light seemed to offer grateful refreshment.  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8179-00000050"/> 104        ANNETTE; OR, i  H -A  PyTCHAPTER XII. A LESSON IN PHLOSOPHY. "TH a sigh of relief, Annette sank down in an easy chair, and closed her eyes, believing herself to be alone. This was not the case, however, for Walter was quietly re- garding her, from the opposite side of the room, where he lay comfortably stretched upon the sofa. ' Elizabeth's description is about to be verified," said he to -himself. "She has 'sighed,' and 'sunk into a chair;' now remains ' sobbing.' Yes, she is at it," as a faint sob reached him. "Next crying-exactly so; she is crying," as the tears rained down poor Annette's cheeks. "Now ' fainting,' is all that is left for her to do, and that is the most deuced unpleasant of all. 'Do you feel as if you were going to faint?'" he asked, suddenly, aloud. Annette started to her feet in surprise, arid, dashing the tears from her eyes, endeavored to answer in a collected tone. "Oh, no, I am not going to faint," she said. "Iam only overcome by the unaccustomed heat of the kitchen. I shall be quite well presently." "Sit down again," said Walter. "It is very injurious to make unnecessary exertions this very warm weather." "But do I not disturb you here?" asked Annette, timidly. "I will go to my own room." "By no means," replied Walter. "I shall be very glad of your company, for I am very tired of my own," and he gave a prodigious yawn.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       105 Annette resumed her seat, regarding him curiously, and not knowing exactly how to sustain the conversation. "So Elizabeth has been trying to cook you, has she?" he remarked, at length, with half-closed eyes. "Not exactly," replied Annette, forcing a smile; "she has been trying to teach me how to cook."  "It amounts to the same thing in hot weather," he replied. "How did she succeed?"' "I was a very stupid scholar," said Annette, "and com- mitted so many blunders that she sent me away in disgust." "Indeed!" said Walter. "Well, you must have been very stupid if Elizabeth gave you up, for she usually sticks to the plan she has in hand with the pertinacity of an adhesive plas- ter."       ' "I was abominably stupid,' said Annette. "I--I strained the soup over the sink and it all ran away." "Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Walter. "Poor Elizabeth! what a fever she must be in. Why, what are you crying about? Crying after lost soup is as useless as 'crying over spilled milk.'" ' "But Miss Elizabeth says you will have no soup for a week, and it is all my fault," sobbed Annette. "So much the better," replied Walter; "I shall be saved a week of dyspepsia. Soup is a horribly indigestible decoction. There! for heaven's sake shut the flood-gates, or I shall be ' floated out of the room."                 - Annette, very much abashed, dried her eyes and endeavored to compose herself. "It is evident," remarked Walter, reflectively, "that Miss Purden is no philosopher. Imagine Socrates weeping of9er a lost plate of soup."                .

"No?" questioned Walter.  "Then your education has been frightfully neglected,- for it is the first principle of happi- ness in man or woman." "I have received an exceedingly good education," ex- claimed Annette, indignant at this reflection cast upon her father. "My father educated me himself, and taught me all- all- that is worth knowing." "Ah! I beg pardon," said Walter. "Forgive my want of penetration in not discovering at first blush that you knew everything." "'I did not mean to say that," said Annette, in confusion. "Of course, I do not know everything; but my father taught me all that he considered it necessary for me to know, and he did not consider philosophy as the groundwork of true happi- ness. ' "That was because he had not sufficiently considered the subject," replied Walter, gravely. "I think I can prove my proposition to your satisfaction, if you will have patience with 'me. In the first place, philosophy promotes an equable state of mind, which you will admit, I am sure, is absolutely neces- sary to complete happiness; secondly, saith the preacher, it elevates the soul above such commonplaces as 'soup,' and causes all 'the ills that flesh is heir to' to affect us as little as the stinging of a gnat; - bad comparison that, I fear, for gnats are deucedly unpleasant companions, and test philosophy as severely as'anything I know.

A little more of this world's goods? riches take to themselves wings when we least expect, and fly away.' What, then, is worth mourning for in this ' vale of tears?' Nothing! -nothing at all! 'Vanity! vanity! all is vanity!' saith the preacher." "You are quoting Scripture," exclaimed Annette, very much shocked, "and comparing Solomnon and Socrates." "By no means comparing Solomon- to Socrates," replied Walter. "Socrates has so much the advantage that the com- parison would be unfair." Annette could find no answer to this atrocious sentiment, and remained gazing in speechless horror upon its expounder, who quietly continued-- "' Does your charmer love you,' saith philosophy, 'be not puffed up with pride; she hath loved many before you, and, no doubt, will love many after, when your day is past. Does she frown upon you, laugh your love to scorn, trample under foot your heart's illusion '-" ): "Well!" said Annette, expectantly, as Walter paused, look- ing eagerly into his face. "Make love to some one else," said .he calmly. Annette threw herself back into her chair, and beat an in- dignant measure on the carpet with her foot. An amused smile passed over Walter's countenance as he perceived the indignation he had aroused in the young girl's breast, whose ideas of love, constancy, etc., had been formed on her own pure model-this being her first introduction to the ordinary rendering of the terms. "No wonder Dr. Wallis warned me against love," thought Annette, "if this is what it really is."  ?i  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC8179-00000052"/> Io8         ANNETTE; OR, "You do not seem to admire my sentiments, Miss Purden," said Walter; "what have I said to call. forth such an angry frown?"

"Without religion or love?" said Walter. "What does that mean? that we cannot, as with other diseases, have both together? Well, if I must choose one, or meet with your dis- approbation, I think I should prefer love." "There is no need to choose between them," said Annette, in a voice full of suppressed feeling'. "They beautify each othet by their contact. The purest love is twin-sister to reli- gion, and religion is all love."

" 'se been a huntin' yer this half hour." "Apropos of love," said Walter, mischievously, "Mr. Her- bert Wellesley appears upon the scene. Has he been properly educated in these matters?" "I know nothing of Mr. Wellesley's opinions on the subject of love," replied Annette, rising from her seat; "but I hope for his own sake as well as " "Your own," suggested Walter. "As his friends, " continued Annette, her usually gentle eyes fairly blazing with anger, "that he is in every respect the opposite of Mr. Walter Westhrooke; " saying which, she swept from the room with the air of a duchess. Annette was naturally of a mild and gentle disposition, but Walter had entered her sanctuary and struck right and left with ruthless hand among her idols.

The day was past, however, "in which Walter could be blasted :: by the lightning glance of a woman's eyes, and Annette's indig- nation only served to amuse him. "She is a fair specimen of' sweet sixteen,' "he said to himself, with a laugh, after she had left the room. "She thinks she knows everything, and really knows nothing-convinced that she has experienced and proved for herself what she has only learned through others' experience, and she is intolerant of all difference of opinion on subjects which she has only heard dis- cussed from one point of view. She must awake to reality some day, poor child. Heigho! It will be a sad awakening;" upon which he fell asleep himself. Annette entered the parlor flushed with excitement, and answered Herbert's greeting with so perturbed a countenance, that he at once perceived that all was not well with her. He feared to question her, however, as to what had occurred to annoy her, lest she should not desire to tell him; he therefore waited patiently for her to broach the subject, which she did not do. Finding that she was disposed to keep silence, he next devoted himself to composing her spirits and distracting her attention from disagreeable thoughts, by conversing gaily' on indifferent topics. He spoke of the various changes that had taken place in P.-- - since he had left it to go abroad, and the still greater ones -in his old playmates. Little curly-headed girls, with whom he never met nor parted in the old time without a warm embrace, ; were now dignified young ladies, and with downcast eyes decor- ously extended him a little hand to press. His boy compan- ions also were no more; and in their place were farmers, law-  yers, doctors, busy actors on the stage of life.

As Herbert conversed, Annette for a time forgot her vexa- tion; but as he proceeded in the description of his many friends, and the varied pursuits in which he-was about to take part, a vague feeling of disquiet took possession of her, and she felt that this interview would not be as pleasant as she had hoped. He had been as kind as a brother to her the day before, and, although scarcely confessing it to herself, she had been anxiously expecting his visit all the morning, longing for him in her foolish heart as the friend into whose sympathizing ear she could pour out all her troubles; yet now that he had come, she realized that he was actually a stranger, with hopes, friends, and interests entirely apart from hers. Unaccustomed as she was to control her emotions, Herbert soon read upon her countenance- that the conversation had ceased to interest her; ,whereupon he broke it off abruptly, saying: "My egotism is wearying you, I fear, and you have not entirely recovered from yesterday's fatigue. Shall I take my leave now, and call again when you feel better?" Annette longed to say, "Oh, no, please do not go;" but the morbid fear lest she should be keeping him from more, agreeable company restrained her, and she extended her hand to him, murmuring an inarticulate acquiescence. Herbert took his leave as much disappointed as Annette at the issue of the visit, to which he had looked forward with such pleasure. He had been interested in her pretty face and friendless con- dition when he had first seen her, and her dependence on him, her sweet voice and winning ways, after the accident, had completed his subjection, so that when he parted with her the   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.

The day, the : hour had arrived, and he had found, instead of the dame -de ses pensees, an awkward and constrained girl, with vexation plainly written on her face, and no desire, apparently, to im- prove the acquaintance of the night before. "I cannot understand it," he said to himself. "I cannot have offended her in any way, yet she is like a different being this morning. I shall not intrude upon her again, however, until I have reason to believe myself welcome," and he con- tinued his way down the gravel walk. Annette, meanwhile, tortured herself, as girls will do, by re- calling the events of the previous day, and imagining herself to have been forward and presuming, forcing herself upon Herbert's notice, and demanding his attention. Had he felt any personal interest in her, thought Annette, he would have questioned her as to how she was situated in the house she had entered with such timidity the evenhig previous. It was evident he had only called out of civility, and she was glad she had let him go. Thus she argued with herself until summoned to dinner, to which she went with slow step and heavy heart.  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8179-00000054"/> "2        ANNETTE; OR, CHAPTER    XIII. "AY SERMONS. A NNETTE'S miserable appearance and want of appetite attracted the attention both of Walter and Elizabeth, as she sat at the dinner-table, each reading in his or her conscience the cause thereof. "She is distressed about the loss of the soup," thought Elizabeth; and, indeed, the absence of the tureen had not tended to soothe Annette's troubled heart. "She is thinking of Solomon, Socrates, and sinners," thought Walter, with a momentary pang of remorse. But Annette was pondering on her own shortcomings, and her depression was caused only by her own sins, and not those of others. Taught from her earliest youth to search her own conscience for wrong-doing, and being naturally inclined to -take an humble view of herself, she rarely accused those around her, but convinced herself generally that she alone was to blame for anything that occurred to trouble her. Thus she reproached herself for her stupidity in the kitchen that morning, and wondered why she had not taken more pains to conciliate Elizabeth. She also mourned deeply that she had not made herself more agreeable to Herbert, or spoken one word of gratitude to him for his kindness the previous evening. And then, Walter; why had she lost her temper so entirely with him? Truly it had been a day of misfortunes. What dreadful things she had said to him; of course, he would never forgive her; and, raising her eyes for the first time since she had seated herself, she ventured a timid glance at him, to see if he was still angry with her.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        II3 But Walter looked as peaceful as a May morn, and, smiling as he caught her eye, said, in a pleasant tone: "Miss Purden, I do not think we can permit Mr. Wellesley to call here again, if he carries your appetite away with him." "Mr. Wellesley!" exclaimed Elizabeth. "Was he here to-day? Why was I not informed of it?" and she looked -inquiringly at Annette, whose cheeks grew redder and redder as her confusion increased. "I think Betsy is the one to be interrogated on that point," said Walter. "Miss Purden could not be expected to know that you-were not informed." "Betsy," said Elizabeth, turning her attention upon her,  why did you not inform me when Mr.- Wellesley called? Have I not told you repeatedly to come for me when you have shown . visitors into the parlor?" "And so I does, missus," said Betsy, " when dey axes for yer; but dis here gent, he axes for Miss Purden, and dun say nothin' 'bout Miss Mordunt, so I jes called Miss Purden, as he axed for." Annette felt a painful sensation of guilt at this last revelation, so severe did Miss Elizabeth look, although she could not ex- actly see in what she was to! blame, until that lady remarked gravely, that in her day young women did not receive com- pany alone, and especially that of young -gentlemen, but she supposed the times had changed. Annette had no excuse to offer, therefore she sat in silence during the rest of the meal, which fortunately was very soon concluded. "I am going out this afternoon on an errand of mercy," : said Elizabeth to Annette, as she rose from the table, "-and intended to ask you to accompany me, that you might see , something of the actual suffering around you; but you seem to  lo *         II' }1            ' ^' ',[i(':  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8179-00000055"/> 1I4        A'NNETTE; OR, be so unwell, that I think it will be better for you to postpone doing so." Annette would have gone almost anywhere just then to es- cape her'own thoughts, and made a faint attempt to disabuse Elizabeth of the impression-that she was unwell (her distemper being of the mind and not of' the body), but in vain; for she had decided when she first saw Annette that she was not strong, and she was not easily moved when she had once formed an opinion. "I do not wish to have you ill upon my hands," she said, in reply to Annette's assurance that she was quite well, and desired to accompany her. "And you have already done as much as you are capable of to-day, so you had better rest for the afternoon, and to-morrow, perhaps, you will be able to go with me," saying which, she left the room, leaving Annette a picture of woe. Walter felt vaguely conscious that it devolved upon him to entertain their guest; but he sat so long considering what he should say and do, that, when he at last looked up, Annette had left the room. "It is as well," he said, with a sigh of relief. "I shJutld certainly have vexed her again had I passed an afternoon alone with her, she is so easily moved to anger. If she were here but for the day, it would be necessary to look after her; but as this is only the first of a long series of days, the sooner she learns to entertain herself the better." After coming to this satisfactory conclusion, he lit a cigar and sauntered out of the house, with no particular aim save that of killing time. Annette, finding herself in solitary possession of the house, wandered from room to room, seeking some object of interest, but finding none.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        I5 It is a subject of doubt whether she would have resisted the "light literature " so much reprehended by Elizabeth, had she been able to'find any books in the library coming under that head; but the temptation was rendered null and void by the discovery that all the works of fiction were in foreign tongues, principally German, of which language she knew nothing. This was a sad disappointment, and She turned regretfully from this bookcase to another, filled with old moth-eaten books, very valuable no doubt to the owner, but to her too uninviting in appearance to be taken from the shelves. The third book- case, the particular property of Elizabeth, was filled with books on theology, sermons, tracts, and story-books for small children. Although very much ashamed of her taste, Annette selected one of the latter, and ensconcing herself in a large arm-chair, endeavored to be interested in the history of a very good little girl, who, after encountering the most remarkable temptations on record, finally went as a missionary, and was eaten by tigers. The afternoon being very warm, and Annette very com- fortable, notwithstanding the exciting interest of the tale, she became very drowsy, and lost herself in a maze of conflicting doubts as to the moral the author had intended to convey. ' Was being eaten by tigers "the reward of virtue," or was this good little girl sacrificed for the good of the tigers? Could she, in this way, have improved their spiritual condition? If so, why not have "missionary feasts " for the ungodly? And then, what had this good little girl to do with tigers-did she go as a missionary to them? Ah, no (she understood at last), the tigers-had gone-as-missionaries-to-her; and   with this comfortable solution of the problem, Annette passed into the land of dreams. Meanwhile, her host and hostess pursued their diverse ways, with, however, very much the same thoughts regarding her.  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8179-00000056"/> I 6        ANNETTE; OR, "I ought to have invited her to go out with me," thought the former. "By Jove! how dismal she looked; but it is so long since I have done as I ought, that the effort to regain the straight and narrow path is prodigious." "I ought to have brought her with me," thought the latter, as she sat in the cottage of a poor sick widow, whose five children were driving her crazy with their noise. "She would at least have taken the children off my hands." Swiftly the afternoon passed for Annette, wandering through Indian jungles, with the golden sunlight glowing all around her, and tigers sporting like lambkins in her path; and with the lerigthening shadows came Elizabeth, rather remorseful for her :long absence, but with many excellent reasons for the same, which she gave more to satisfy herself than Annette. Supper was soon announced, and they sat down together, Walter not having returned from his walk. Elizabeth detailed her afternoon's work, and interested Annette extremely in the widow's neglected children. "You must take me with you the next time you go," said she; "I perhaps I may be of some use." "Yes, I will," said Elizabeth; "and then you must -make the acquaintance of your pastor and his wife, who are the salt of the earth." "If, however," said a voice from the hall, " this ' salt' hath lost its savor (as it decidedly has so far as I am concerned), ' wherewith shall it be salted?' " "Walter!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "keep your blasphemous observations for those who enjoy them, and spare the ears of defenceless woman." Walter, who had entered the room whilst she was speaking, now came forward and seated himself at the table, exclaiming: "My dear sister, I am a modern Don Quixote in regard to   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       II7 defenceless females. Have, then, no fear for your ears, but rather fear for your larder, for I am as hungry as a hawk." Nothing mollified Elizabeth so quickly as due appreciation ,of the viands she always prepared with such care, and in pro- viding for Walter's corporal wants, she for the time forgot his spiritual ones. Only for a time, however; for, after they had retired from the dining-room, and were seated comfortably upon the porch, enjoying the delightful evening breeze, Elizabeth returned to the subject. "-My dear," she said, addressing Annette, "I do not wish you to allow yourself to be prejudiced by anything Mr. West- brooke may say against the Rev. Archibald Stone, for he is a godly man, and one to be looked up to in every respect. He is not the man to allow a sinner to repose-" "Oh, no," groaned Walter. "I have often tried it during the sermon, but he was too noisy to admit of even a five minutes' nap."            - "To repose in his sins," continued Elizabeth, with a lofty disregard of his interruption. "He calls to him-he shakes him roughly until he awakes--and then points out to him the frightful chasm on the brink of which he stands. Ah, there have been many revivals since he has had this charge." "Revivals!" exclaimed Walter; "how I hate the word; not more, however, than I do the thing itself. Take care of yourself. Miss Purden, and do not be swept into this vortex of sentimental religion, called a ' revival.' " "How can you talk so, Walter!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "when almost every biography of a departed Christian points to some particular revival as the turning-point of his or her existence?" "That may very well be so, Elizabeth," answered he, "and  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8179-00000057"/> -' IUS       A NNETTE; OR, the principle is all right, to arouse to consciousness those who are so absorbed in this world's affairs as to forget that there is another; but the excess is the thing that angers me, and your revered pastor is just the person to indulge in it." "You do him injustice," said Elizabeth. "You judge him without understanding. You never go to church, you never listen to his doctrines, and even avoid all personal intercourse with him; how, then, can you form an adequate opinion of him?" "My dear lady, it is not necessary to hear a clergyman's sermons to know what the man is: he shows that forth in his life. Any man of talent and learning can preach a good ser- mon, but only a godly man can live a holy life. Our friend Archibald Imalies broad his phyla'cteries,' and 'stands in the market-places' crying, -' Lord Lord!' but his life will not bear scrutiny." "Walter," said Elizabeth, "you really distress me by say- ing such unseemly things of one whom I esteem. If such be your opinion, indeed, surely you might refrain from expressing it before me, when you remember that he is a personal friend." "Surely I might, my sister, and I will say no more," replied Walter; " let us change the subject, for it is one we shall never agree upon." "Tell us, then, where you have been this afternoon," said Elizabeth, " and what you have seen." "I -passed a very agreeable afternoon with Mr. Herbert Wellesley," replied Walter, " on whom I. called to express my thanks for his recent care of our guest." "Oh, it was very kind of you to call on my account," said Annette, entirely overcome by Walter's- extreme generosity in not only forgiving her rude behavior, but heaping coals of fire upon her head in this way. "Not at all,'" replied Walter; "'virtue was its own   THEt CHlRONICLELS OF   ELLEVUE.

I think we shall be very good friends. I have asked him  to ride over and see us as often as he is able whilst he remains in this part of the country.":? Walter glanced at Annette as he said these words, to see how  they affected her, and she, remembering his remarks in the morning, became so confused as to confirm him in the impres- i sion that there existed a serious attachment between Herbert ^ and herself. "Ah," thought Annette, as she went up stairs to her room,- "if he but knew that I met Mr. Wellesley for the first' time', yesterday, how very much surprised he would be." "Herbert will be an excellent match for her," mused Walter about the same time. "He is good-looking, of the proper age, X and has very fair -prospects. What a blessing it would be to X have her comfortably disposed of. Mr. Wellesley's company must be courted, without doubt."  Puff, puff, went the cigar for a few moments, and then he added, "Poor little thing! she  is very-pretty; it is a great pity that she must be married; but I see no help for it." ... .  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8179-00000058"/> t1 -       ANNETTE;- OR, CHAPTER XIV. A DUET. ANNETTE retired to rest that night with an earnest prayer A that her second day at Bellevue might prove an improve- ment on the first; but, alas! she was doomed to disappoint- ment, for not only the next day, but the next, and the next, passed by in the same dreary monotony, and when, at the expi- ration of two or three weeks, she found herself no better off, as far as friends, occupation, and interests went, her spirits sank, and she gave way entirely.  She had made acquaintances, it is tru% but no one seemed desirous of following up the formal call they made upon her  i with any warmer demonstration, and she was too reserved her- self to make an effort to attract attention. Walter and Elizabeth gave themselves very little trouble about -her, taking it for granted that she' was happy as long as she did not complain; and between Herbert and herself, although he was constantly at the house, there still remained the slight cloud that had arisen on his first visit. The more intimately he became  acquainted with her, the greater became his admiration, whilst the evident unconge- niality of her surroundings called forth his sympathy in a strong degree; yet he hesitated to give it words without some encour- agement to do so, and contented himself, with expressing it in devoted attention to her on all occasions. She accepted these attentions gratefully, but at the same time endeavored to avoid them, being persuaded of the fact that her too great freedom on the occasion of their first meeting was the cause of them.    She had looked forward with interest to the introduction of '  the Rev. Archibald, half-hoping to find in him a friend and , adviser, such as she had lost in her father; but a single glance V; at his portly presence, his little cold gr&amp;y eyes, that seemed to .- be forever weighing you in the balance and finding you want- ing, and his smooth, shapely hands that he perpetually wrapped around each other as if washing them free from the dross of the" world, convinced her of the futility of her hopes.     : He had bowed to her stiffly and made some com mon-place remarks, after which he limited himself to "yea, yeas," and ' nay, nays." The fact is, his strong point was classifying regenerate and unregenerate sinners, and, regarding Annette as an entomologist would a new species of insect, he was unable to speak until he had placed her in some specific class. His wife was a very subdued little woman, adoring and fear- : ing her husband as at once the most superior and worst-tem- G pered person of her acquaintance. Any love that she may have ': -felt for him had been lost long- before in unbounded reverence, and she had bestowed all she had to give upon their son, a tall, lanky young man of one-and-twenty years of age, and without any particular attraction, personal or mental, in other eyes than his mother's.   Annette had been requested to make herself agreeable to this :.*; young gentleman, arid had endeavored so to do, but with small : success, as he, like his father, contented himself with answering : "yes " or 'no," as suited the question asked, but made no : effort towards originating a remark.       v     '?! She was introduced to the parochial work, and allowed to : visit the poor, but Sunday-schools were forbidden her until her -, principles had been investigated by her pastor.     /+ Thus passed the dreary days, lengthening themselves into ? weeks, and, as I have said, Annette lost heart at the distnal -. :- "              ,   ,     , ,,,:I,  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8179-00000059"/> *'*        ANNETTE; OR, prospect opening before her, of a life's sojourn among such un- congenial scenes. She assisted Elizabeth in her household duties. She read dry books to " improve her mind " at her suggestion, and twice a week, with her little basket on her arm, she visited the poor, giving them what was more valuable than the contents of the basket, her gentle sympathy and compassion; but this was all done wearily, and without spirit. The color left her cheek, and elasticity her footsteps! Her appetite failed, and sleep for- sook her pillow; sleep, that blessed restorer of health and spirits. It was the evening before Herbert's departure for New York, and Walter and himself were taking a farewell stroll together around the grounds. "I shall miss you, old fellow," said Walter. "I do not feel half inclined to let you go. What shall I do without you? I have become so dependant upon you for companionship, in my literary and physical exercises, that I shall feel lost when you leave me." "I am  very unwilling to go, I am sure," replied Herbert, but it seems to be necessary. If I am ever going to do any- thing, it is time to begin." "But why ' do anything,' as you express it?" said Walter. "You have plenty of money to live a jolly life with, and no particular taste for your profession, so throw care to the dogs, and stay here, where you are happy. Happiness is the chief end of man, and he that seizes all that he can, makes ' a good ending on't.'" "Walter! Walter!" exclaimed Herbert, laughing, "don't think to thrust your epicureanism upon me. I am too old a stager. Take some one who is ignorant of life as it is, if you wish a disciple. So few are there who attain real happiness in    this world, notwithstanding all their efforts, that one does net feel encouraged to make it the goal of one's ambition. Its  shadow is about all that ever falls to our lot, a promise of what is to come." "And what then, if I may ask, is the chief end of man?" inquired Walter; "that is, as considered from your stand- point." "To 'do his duty in that state of life,' etc., according to the Catechism," said Herbert, lightly. "A very dreary kind of amusement, that," said Walter, lugubriously.  "Go your own way, my dear fellow, by all' means; but, for Heaven's sake, don't ask me to go with you." "You would be much better off, if you did," replied Her'-. bert; " for, believe me, in the proper performance of duty is the most endurable happiness." "Exactly so," said Walter. "My dear boy, you have reached the point from which you started, only by another route than mine."  -.  "I do not see that," said Herbert, looking puzzled. "It is very plain, notwithstanding," replied Walter. "Be so kind as to enlighten me," said Herbert. "My mind is obtuse, perhaps." "With pleasure,'d replied -Walter.  "I have asserted that the chief end of man is happiness. You have objected to this pro- position, and declare it to be duty, affirming at the- same time that in duty well performed consists the greatest happiness; therefore, admitted: first, that duty is the chief end of man; : secondly, that duty is happiness, ergo,. happiness is the chief; end of man. There, is not that scientifically argued? I flatter myself that I have left you nothing to say." "I beg your pardon, sir," replied Herbert. '"You do indeed  flatter yourself, if you think that you have closed the debate. t ' i   &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8179-00000060"/> 124        ANNETTE; OR, Your sophistry is light as down, and can be blown away by a breath. In the first place you forget that the discussion pro- ceeded from your proposition, that I should forsake duty to seek pleasure, proving that the happiness you then considered the chief end of man had nothing whatever to do with that which springs from the performance- of duty, but was to be sought for its own sake; on the other hand, I offered no objection to hap- piness as a contingent circumstance, only refusing to accept it as an object for ambition. Your aim you pronounce to be happiness, and if duty interfere, you say, cast duty to the four winds. My aim I declare to be duty, and if happiness results, well and good; but, if not, then duty at any cost--' ergo,' ' happiness is not the chief end of man." "My dear fellow, you are very shallow," replied Walter. "You are arguing against yourself. Do you not perceive that a man performing his duty at any cost, looks to the happiness that he will experience after it is done? therefore, his aim is happiness. Take my word for it, all men are pretty much alike in this respect, only some are honest, like myself, and' say, ' I do my duty, that I may feel comfortable;' whilst others clasp their hands, raise their eyes and exclaim, 'We do this for the glory of God.'" "I do not understand you," said Herbert, gravely. 'Do you class me as a hypocrite, Walter?" "By Jove, old fellow, don't look so serious about a piece of pleasantry," exclaimed Walter. "Don't you see that I have been arguing for argument's sake, and that having been nearly entrapped by you, I am making good my escape at all hazards?" "If it is only pleasantry," said Herbert, " you must excuse me if I say, that I think/you might find a more suitable subject upon which to exercise it." "Heigho!" exclaimed Walter. "I wish I lived in a less    THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       I125 elevated atmosphere of piety. I never enter upon the most trivial subjects without injuring some one's feelings." "Mine are not materially damaged," said Herbert, with his usual genial smile- " that is, not past recovery, with good nursing; but whose feelings have you been experimenting upon, in a pleasant way besides mine?" "Well, there is Elizabeth to begin with. I am always in dis- grace with her; and then her worthy pastor has long since written me down as a black sheep. I have no reason, however, to believe that the ' Book of Life ' will be copied from his notes, thank heaven. Then, I have irretrievably ruined myself in the eyes of my little guest, who looks upon me with the sad, sorrow- ful eyes of a child, who knows that its play-fellow/ has done something very naughty." "Miss Purden?" questioned Herbert. "What did you say to vex her?" and he fixed his eyes eagerly on his friend, hoping to find a solution of the perplexing change in Annette. Walter briefly related his conversation with Annette- on the morning after her arrival, ending with her final remark as she left the library for the parlor. "You surely did not insinuate that you supposed she cared anything for me!" exclaimed Herbert. "I am afraid I must plead guilty," replied Walter. "I do not remember exactly what I said, but I was quite certain, from her confusion, that an understanding existed between you." "Then there is no punishment too great for you, you scamp " exclaimed Herbert. "I now understand why she became so cold to me suddenly. You have done me an irreparable in- jury!" and he began to walk on quickly towards the house. "Stop a moment," cried Walter. "What is the matter? what have I done?

Walter overtook him, and seizing him by the arm, exclaimed: "Give me a hearing, at least; I had no intention of making any difficulty between you by my remarks, and in fact, I do not see how any trouble could arise from them. JIt is not a heart-breaking matter, I should think, for a girl to be accused of fancying a young man like yourself." "Perhaps not, for an ordinary girl," replied Herbert, " but she is unlike all girls that I have seen. She is so unversed in the ways of the world; so modest and retiring; that a mere suggestion that I had won her affections would be enough to make her shun me forever. " "What a 'rara avis!'" exclaimed Walter. "She should be kept in a glass case, and only shown on greatcoccasions, lest she should lose her bloom by associations with such men as myself." "That she could never do," said Herbert, excitedly. "Her bloom will never fade. She is so pure and lovely of heart, that time can never change her, and though he may whiten her locks and steal the light from her eyes, yet will she ever be as fresh as a new-" "Laid egg," said Walter, finishing his sentence for him, although not exactly in the style that Herbert intended. "Yes, I know all about it, you see. I can sympathize with you." "I should be sorry to have to depend upon you for sym- pathy," replied Herbert. "Why so?" inquired Walter. "Because your sense of the ludicrous is so strong, that I believe you would ridicule a man upon his death-bed," replied' Herbert. "No, I do not think that I would," said Walter, reflectingly, s    THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        I27 v i  "and for one very good reason, which is, that, having a great objection to death-bed scenes, I would not countenance a man who was guilty of one, by being present on the occasion. However, I have nothing to do with a dying man, it is with one who is, for the time being, bereft of his reason that I have to deal. Now, my good fellow, don't force me to use a straight- jacket. What the devil are you rushing on at this pace for? Were your' inamorata' to appear suddenly, you would assuredly run over her. You will frighten Miss Purden to death, if you appear before her in your present state of excitement, and I do nodt believe you know, any more than I do, what you are going to say to her." "I am going to explain matters," said Herbert. "And what' matters' are you going to explain-?" inquired Walter. "I did not know that there was any actual misunder- standing between you; I thought it was only a conjecture on your part, that she had avoided you on account of something that I had said, and, if you are mistaken, I should think it would be difficult to explain a misunderstanding that did not exist." "You are right," said Herbert, checking himself in his wild career. "It is only a conjecture, after all. She may be avoid- ing me because she does not like me." "I do not believe that," said Walter, kindly, touched by the tone of genuine distress in Herbert's voice. "I think she is inclined to be morbid, and imagine that no one cares for her- society. Are you sane enough now to listen to sober advice?" "( Go on," said Herbert, with a smile. '-I will listen to it, but I will not bind myself to act accordingly." "I ask nothing but that you will listen," replied Walter, "for I am convinced that the other will follow.

"Or," continued Walter, " she may have conceived an affec- tion for a certain young man of our acquaintance, and, with that charming modesty so essentially her own, have avoided him, lest, in some moment of forgetfulness, she should betray herself." "If I could believe that," said Herbert, "1 should be supremely happy.." "Then be happy, my boy," said Walter, " for such I believe to be the real state of the case; but, to make assurance doubly sure, you may go to her when you are sufficiently composed, and try to win from her the secret that is preying upon her." "That I will do!" exclaimed Herbert,- energetically. "It is a capital plan, and I will act upon it immediately." "Good luck to you," said Walter, with a smile, "and do not be too abrupt. Take good aim before you fire, or the report of your gun will cause your bird to fly away, whilst your bullet lodges in a neighboring tree."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        129 CHAPTER XV. EXPLANATIONS. HERBERT walked rapidly to the house in search of Annette, but found instead Elizabeth, who entered at once into a conversation that bade fair to last all night without a break. In the midst of it, however, he caught sight of a white dress half hidden among the trees at the further end of the garden, and, uttering a few hasty apologies, he quited her abruptly, and hastened with beating heart in that direction. Annette was in her favorite retreat, under an old chestnut tree, at some distance from the house, where she was wont to dream away her lonely hours, making a world to suit herself, and peopling it with heroes and. heroines of her own creation. Here Herbert found her, stretched upon the moss at the foot of the tree, her eyes fixed earnestly upon some little birds that were hopping near her, to reach the crumbs she had scattered for them upon the grass. Herbert's arrival put them to flight, just as they were yielding to her persuasions and approaching nearer to the tempting food. With an exclamation of disappointment, Annette looked up to see the cause of their alarm, and perceived Herbert standing before her. She rose to her feet instantly, and returned his greeting nervously, scarcely allowing her hand to remain in his grasp as long as civility required. "Do not let me disturb you, or I shall go away again," said Herbert. "It is very pleasant here. May I sit beside you and I  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8179-00000063"/> I3o        ANNETTE; OR, enjoy a few moments of peace- and tranquillity, or will my presence frighten you away like your feathered companions?" "I think you may sit down without any such fear," replied Annette with a smile, as she seated herself beneath the tree. "I do not find you alarming to that degree." " This reminds me of our picnic on the day I was so fortu- nate as to make your acquaintance," said Herbert, as he threw himself on the ground beside her. He could not have chosen a more unfortunate opening to his conversation, and a painful blush suffused Annette's cheek, at having thus brought before her a circumstance that she had earnestly tried to forger, and devoutly hoped that he had for- gotten. Turning her eyes in the opposite direction, she remained silent, longing in her heart to know his real opinion of her conduct on that occasion, and yet instinctively shunning the subject. Herbert waited a few moments to see if she would make any remark in regard to his singular introduction, that would throw any light on the subject- he had in hand, but, when she made no answer, he determined to come to the point at once and discover why she avoided him. "I have come on a sad errand this evening," he said, "to bid you good-bye for a very long time, perhaps forever. I am going to New York to-morrow, to enter upon the duties of my profession." "To-morrow!  so soon!" exclaimed Annette, turning towards him and looking wistfully into his face. "It is not 'so soon,' said Herbert, with a smile, "it is rather 'so late.' I have wasted a whole month here which might have been profitably employed." "'Oh, you are perfectly right," replied Annette. "When   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       13I one has work to do, one is not comfortable until one is doing it, I know." "Alas! I do not know it," replied Herbert. S I know, to , the contrary, that I have been leading such a lazy, happy life here, under the superintendence of Mr. Westhrooke, that I feel wholly disinclined to hard work." "Then it is ineed time for you to go away," said Annette, earnestly. "For I would rather anything should befall you than that -you should sink into the easy good-for-nothing life that Mr. Westhrooke leads. He is a burden to himself and all, around him." "Not quite so bad as that," said Herbert, with a smile, "Walter is a very good fellow in his way, as you would find if you ever had anything to do with him. You keep so much aloof that you are not competent to pass judgment upon any of us. Why is it that you thus avoid us? Pray tell me?" he added, as she made no response. "Mr. Westhrooke does not desire my company," replied Annette; " he only amuses himself at my expense when I am with him, and Miss Mordaunt considers me too much of a child to be her companion." "And how about myself?" said Herbert. "In what way have I deserved to be shunned by the fair lady I'escorted here, and for whom I braved the unknown dangers of the enchanted castle? I thought, when I left that night, that you were -in good hands, but now my heart misgives me, end I fear that, innocent as Miss Mordaunt looks, she is in reality an enchant- ress, and has cast a spell upon my princess, whereby she makes her forget her best friends. How is it? Am I right?" "I never forget one who has been kind to me," said Annette, in a faltering voice.

"Why have you forgotten that you once consented to take me for a friend? Surely I have done nothing since to make my- self more unworthy than I was when you did mp this honor." Annette averted her face, but made no answer. "Will you not speak to me?" said Herbert, gently, "do'- not be afraid to tell me if my company is displeasing to you; I can bear it, for I have thought as much for some time." "Oh, no, you could not have supposed that," said Annette, raising her head, and looking at him in genuine distress. "You, who know how friendless I am, could not think that I would, of my own accord, cast from me a friend like yourself." "Then why have you done it?" said Herbert, earnestly. "Ah! I beg of you to put aside all reserve, and tell me can- didly what has caused the breach between us. " Annette hid her face in her hands, as in a broken voice she said: "I thought when I saw you the day after my arrival that your heart was engrossed by friends of an earlier date than myself, and I feared to claim of you the promise of the night before, lest I should be taking an undue advantage of your kindness, and encroach where I had no right." The last words were so low that Herbert could scarcely dis- tinguish them, and some pearly drops made their way between her fingers, and fell upon her dress. Herbert remained silent a moment, with his heart too full for words. She did not dislike him then; nay, she even cared about him, if he might trust that eloquent face that had for a moment been turned towards his own. He leaned towards her, and, taking hold of her hands, drew them down. "My princess," he said, looking tenderly into her tear-   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        133 stained countenance, "why do you cry? Ioo you not know that I am your most devoted slave? Do you not know that the friend does not exist who could ever fill your place in my heart? If I have friends of an earlier date (which I can scarcely believe, for I feel as if I had known you all my life), let us make up this inequality by an increase of warmth in our friendship, that we may condense that of years into a few brief moments." Annette looked up timidly into his face, and her heart flut- tered like a bird, as she saw the love impressed thereon. "Do you agree?" asked Herbert, stooping still nearer. "Yes," murmured Annette, drooping her head and eyes before his earnest gaze. "Thus we will seal the contract," said Herbert, in a voice full of emotion, and stooping, he impressed a kiss upon the little hand he still held. "Friends forever, the warmest and dearest of friends!" "Yes," whispered Annette, more and more agitated. Thus they sat in silence for a time, whilst Herbert tried to realize his bliss, and then the real purpose for which he had sought Annette occurred to him, and he said, anxiously: "I am about to enter on my duties as friend and protectors at once, and ask you to confide to me what it is that is destroy- ing your health and spirits. If you are not well, you must have a physician immediately." "Oh, there is nothing the matter with me," replied Annette, "that is not easily cured. I feel quite well to-night. The life I lead is so desolate. I have been used always to have some one interested in me, whose approval gave zest to the humblest task, and here no one cares where I go, or what I do. I do not know why it is, but Miss Mordaunt will not love me, or suffer me to love her, and my heart preys upon itself for want of- an object of interest.

But now it will be better," she added, with a shy glance at him; "I shall have you." The last words fell like music upon Herbert's ear, and it was with an effort that he restrained himself from throwing his arms around her, and pouring out the love that was in his heart; but, no! he could not ask her to be his wife whilst he had no home to offer her; it would be unmanly to bind her for a term of years. He would go to New York the following day, and when he had settled himself to work in earnest, then he would came back and claim his reward at her hand ; therefore, check- ing the burning words upon his lips, he said, instead: "But I must leave you to-morrow, you know, and how will you get along in my absence? Will you not fight against this depression, .and take care of your health for the sake of- the friend who will feel so anxious about you?" "I will try," said Annette, but even as she spoke a-shadow flitted over her face, at the thought of lhis departure. "Is not that the tea-bell I hear " she exclaimed, starting to her feet. "How long we must have been sitting here. Did you know it was so late?" "No, indeed," replied Herbert, with a sigh, rising to follow her. "It seems but a moment ago that I found you here, and now I must say good-bye!" Walter came to meet them as they neared the house, and, judging from Herbert's radiant, countenance that they had come to an understanding, invited him cordially to join them at the tea-table. But Herbert-felt unwilling to appear before any one in his present state of excitement, and feared to trust himself just yet Annette's presence, lest he should betray to other eyes than hers the love that was flooding his soul; therefore, he declined , .,   the invitation, and bade Annette adieu, with a lingering pres-  sure of the hand. "I shall walk part of the way with you, since you cannot stay," said Walter, as he turned to bid him good-bye, and Herbert was obliged to accept his company, although he would infinitely have preferred communing with his own heart, and realizing more fully his great happiness. They walked in silence through the grounds; but when they had gained the high-road, Walter handed his cigar-case to Her- bert, saying: "' Smoke is the food of lovers;' take one, old fellow." "Thank you," said Herbert, laughingly, as he helped himself. "I would offer you a light," continued Walter, but you seem so full of electricity this evening, that I suppose you can light your cigar with the ends of your fingers." "Come! come!" said Herbert, gaily,!" don't be hard on a fellow because he has fallen in love. I suspect you have done the same thing yourself in the past, if you would but acknowl- edge it." A look of sudden pain passed over Walter's face, and he set his teeth together sharply, as though some one had struck him; recovering himself quickly, however, he replied, gaily:  "Better leave my past alone, old fellow; it will not bear inspection. I have been in love a score of times, but never as you are now." 'Then try it again," said Herbert; "find some one whom ' you can love, respect and admire, as I do-'Annetteand' marry her." He spoke her name for the first time, and it came from his ;  lips lingeringly, as though he were loath to part with its or were prolonging its sweet music.

"How so?" inquired Herbert. "If I were to ask you the ' chief end of man' at present, I am quite sure that you would answer, ' matrimony. " "Well, it is certainly 'a means to the end,'" replied Her- bert, "whether considered by you or myself; for surely we would do our duty better with a gentle, loving heart beside us, pointing to all good and holding us back from evil; and as for happiness -" a Ah, yes; stop there. Do not say anything about that, you will get beyond your depth. We will consider it unutterable," said Walter, with a short laugh; " but, to change the subject, did you discover your lady-love's secret grief this afternoon?" ", Oh, yes," replied Herbert, " and that reminds me, Walter, that I have a great favor to ask of you. Will you do me a good turn, old fellow?" "I will try to," replied Walter, " but you must be quick and state what it is, as we have come as far as I am going, for I am tired." ". Let us sit down on this log for a moment then," said Her- bert, "and you can rest yourself while I talk to you." They sat down, accordingly, and after a moment's pause, Herbert continued: "I gathered from Miss Purden's account of herself, that her suffering was of the heart, and not of -the body. She feels isolated here, and her life has grown weary and monotonous for want of some person or thing in which to interest herself. She thinks that both your sister and yourself shun her, con- sidering her beneath your notice, and therefore it is that she spends so much of her time alone." "I told you she was morbid," replied Walter, "and now, what is it I can do for you?"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       I37 - You know how dearly I love her," continued Herbert, "and you can easily guess what anguish it causes me to be obliged to leave her to. suffer alone, to torment herself into dis- believing, even in-me, and perhaps to worry herself into an early grave." "It is not a lively prospect to dwell upon," said Walter. "As yet," continued Herbert, "I have spoken no word of love to her, although I think she understands my feelings, for I am not in a position to marry; but I hope and trust that the time is not far distant when I may lay my heart at her feet, and ask her to share my lot." "And meanwhile?" asked Walter. "Meanwhile, my friend," said Herbert, placing his hand on Walter's shoulder, "I would ask you, when I am gone, to be- friend this lonely child. To seek some amusement for her; to talk to her and cheer her; in other words, to be to my darling the friend you have been to me. Walter, will you accept this trust?"    ' Walter remained silent for some moments, looking moodily at the shadows cast by the rising moon, and then raising his head, and looking full in Herbert's face, he said: "Herbert, you are giving me a very difficult task to perform, and a very thankless one. Difficult, inasmuch as I am no ladies' man, and would be but an awkward esquire of dames; thank- less, inasmuch as I could do nothing that would meet the approbation of a young lady whose thoughts were centred upon another man, were I to devote my life to her service. 'If  she drooped and pined, whilst under my care, you would accuse me of neglect; and if, on the other hand, she became well and happy, you would be as jealous as the Moor, and probably hate me for the rest of your life."

"Your love is more unselfish than mine, old fellow," said Walter, looking at his friend with admiration. "I could not act in that way, were I to be so tried; my blood would boil to fever heat, and I would first run the thief through the body with my sword, and then sheath it in my own breast." "I will take care not to interfere in your love affairs, under those circumstances," said Herbert, with a laugh. "Must you go?" he added, as Walter rose from his seat. "Yes, it is time for me to return," replied Walter, holding out his hand, "and I will promise to do my best for Miss Pur- den's comfort and amusement during your absence, if you, on your part, will promise that, whatever betides, you will not give way to unjust feelings, but come to me like a man and tell me wherein I have offended." "I promise," said Herbert, grasping the outstretched hand. "Good-bye, old fellow, and God bless you." "Good-bye," said Walter, and the two friends parted to meet again under very different circumstances. Meanwhile, Annete had gone into tea in a dazed and be- wildered state of mind, feeling as if Elizabeth must at once detect a great change in her since the morning; but fortunately for her, Elizabeth's attention was engrossed by the misde- meanors of the dairy-maid, who had appropriated some of the butter, and conveyed it home, wherewith to regale a select party of admirers that evening; and Elizabeth was so bent upon having her brought to justice, that she would not have noticed it, had Annette come to supper in her wedding-dress. Having swallowed her tea, Annette slipped away unnoticed   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       139 from the table, and took refuge in her own room, to think over the events of the afternoon. A feeling of gladness stole over her heart, to which it had- long been a stranger. It was so pleasant to sit and think of Herbert, as one in whom she had a right to be interested, and to think that he was perhaps thinking of her, in return. There was no excitement about her happiness, she was simply pleased, as a child is with a new toy. She thought of Herbert's speaking eyes, that had looked so eloquently into her own, and had seemed to search her very soul; and then' her heart fluttered a little as she thought could this be love? Was Herbert in love with her? Was she in love with him? and this last sug- gestion called forth a merry little peal of laughter on her part, as she sprang into bed and hid her blushing cheeks amid the pillows. Love! what nonsense! there had been no talk of it between them, she thought: he had not asked her to be his wife, but his friend, and that she would be to -the; end of her days. Yes, she would be true to him; and they would be as brother and sister to one another as long as they lived. But he was to leave her the next day'; that was very sad. She was quite certain that she would be unable to sleep any that night for thinking of it; and even, as the-thought passed through her mind, her weary eyelids closed, their soft fringes swept her smooth, round cheek, and she fell into a sweet; untroubled slumber.   &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8179-00000068"/> "O         ANNETTE; OR, CHAPTER XVI. ROUSED AT LAST. T  HE next day was full of sunshine for Annette. She had something to think of, and her fingers responded to the activity of her brain; so that all she undertook was done rapidly and well. Not unfrequently she caught herself singing little scraps of songs, unstudied and disconnected, but springing spontaneously from her glad heart, like the warbling of a bird. Elizabeth regarded her with a puzzled expression, doubting as to whether this was not some new development of a highly strung nervous organization, that required serious attention, while Walter congratulated himself on the change that had taken place in her, as it relieved him of all care in regard to her amusements.  She certainly needed no consolation at present, and he smiled as he recalled her lover's unnecessary anguish. This delightful state of affairs was not to last long, however, for Annette had not yet learned to bear up against adverse circum- stances, and as the days passed by without bringing any letter from Herbert, she began to distrust her memory, and to think that she must have magnified his words and looks. It was with great difficulty that he prevented himself from writing to her; he had taken up his pen a score of times for the express purpose, but the words that fell from it were so ardent and loving, so entirely opposed to the fraternal interest he had expressed for her, that he feared to send them, lest he should offend her by a premature avowal of his feelings; so he wrote a frantic letter to Walter instead, conjuring him to keep him.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       I4I informed as to the well-being of the object of his affections, or he should go mad. Walter, humoring his absurdity, wrote him weekly bulletins, but of this Annette was unaware, and believed herself forgotten. That Herbert had been obliged to leave her she knew, and believed that at the time he had been unwilling to go, but, if the interest he professsd had been sincere, would he not have written to her, if only a line? Yes, surely he would, had he not forgotten her, which was doubtless the case: so she fell back once more into her old moping ways, and went about as if life were a burden too heavy to be borne. Thus she sat under the chestnut-tree one bright, balmy after- noon, when nature seemed to have put on her holiday garb, and the birds to be holding a festival in her honor, with a heart as heavy as lead, and with no eyes or ears for the united beau- ties of sight and sound; and here she was found, half-drowned in tears, by Walter and Elizabeth, who came upon her suddenly on their return from a ramble over the farm. "That child has no ballast, " exclaimed Elizabeth, angrily, as they turned to withdraw unperceived by the weeping An- nette. "Singing and laughing one day, weeping and wailing another, and with no more reason for doing either than a baby." "Hush!" said Walter, in a low voice; "speak lower, or she will hear you." "So much the better," said Elizabeth, scorning to modulate her voice for such a reason. "It may be of service to her to know exactly how she appears to others. She acts like a sim-. pleton; spending half of her days weeping for nothing what- ever. I never knew anything but a salt-spring produce such a quantity of brine in so short a time." "Perhaps it is partly our fault that she sheds so many tears," said Walter.

A softer expression stole over-Elizabeth's face at this sugges- tion, and she asked, with less asperity: "What is it that we have left undone? I have been as kind ' to her as I know how." "I am sure of that," replied Walter; " but she needs occu- pation; some object of interest to arouse her from her grief, and to fill the void left in her life by 'the loss of a parent who was all in all to her.? "Nonsense,' exclaimed Elizabeth, with a toss of her head. "There is quite enough to interest her in life, if she chose to be interested; .but she prefers sulking under that tree all the afternoon to taking a healthy walk, which would act as a tonic to body and mind. There is nothing but bad-temper the mat- ter with her, I will answer for it," and she walked into the house, leaving Walter outside in a very perplexed state of mind. Now was the time for action, without doubt, if he intended to be true to his promise, and that he certainly did; but he could think of no method of consoling Annette, nor of any pos- sible plan for her amusement. ; Lord!" he groaned, as he continued to walk up and down in front of the hoise, his hopelessness increasing at every turn, "What will become   of me?  High-winds rising; cross-seas cutting; barometer falling hourly, and no compass on board.'" Annette had stood motionless for a few moments after they  i left the spot, speechless with indignation'at Elizabeth's words, ( which had fallen on her ear; then she stole noiselessly around the house, in at the back door, and up to her own room, where she stood at the toilet-table, brush in hand. ,       - "I must collect myself, "she said, her breath coming and   going quickly in her excitement. "She must not know that I care for her words; I have no ballast;' no more reason for   ; what I do than a ' baby.'

A gasping sob, and the brush vigorously attacked the disheveled hair, that, spurning all con- trol, was curling and waving about a flushed and, indignant face, framing it in golden brown. "And- all this to Mr. Westhrooke, who already considers me a little fool," she continued: " not that it inatters what he thinks; I would rather he thought ill than well of me; it would be more to my credit; but it was so mean to-say such things- behind my back. I hate her!" another sob: " she shall never see me cry again!" a furious stab with a pin at a curl that would not keep its place, and two more half-smothered sobs. "I never will cry again: oh! dear!" and, dropping brush, comb, and pins, down she went into a chair, in a paroxysm of, sobs and tears. It was only for a short time, however, that she thus yielded to her feelings. Her pride had been thoroughly aroused, and  a determination to appear calm and dignified when she next met Elizabeth, subdued all other emotions.  She returned with undiminished ardor to the attack upon her refractory'curls, and, after tearing out about a handful of hair, succeeded in reducing them to order, after which she shook out her rumpled dress, and patiently bathed her eyes, until the tea-bell rang; when, upon looking anxiously in the glass,- she discovered that her efforts had been crowned with success, and all trace of emotion had departed from her face.

Was this the Niobe he ,had seen beneath the chest- nut-tree? It seemed impossible that those bright eyes could ever have wept, or that face ever been other thanf wreathed in smiles. His surprise was complete when his hitherto shy and awkward guest opened the conversation by asking him where he had been all the afternoon. "My sister and myself have been rambling over the farm,"/ he replied. "You should have accompanied us, Miss Purden, and given us your opinion upon the' best field for the oats, the proper horse to be used in the plough, and the best method of draining a swamp." "What a pity you did not suggest it before you went instead of after your return," said Annette. "You do not know what useful information I might have given you; I have no doubt that I should have been as useful to you on the farm as I was to your sister in the kitchen." "I have no doubt of it," replied Walter, with a lauh. "You seem to be rather proud of your ignorance," remarked Elizabeth, in freezing tones. "When I was young, girls moved about and endeavored to acquire information, instead of sitting moping at home, and glorying in their want of knowledge." The very sound of her voice acted as fresh fuel to the flame of indignation already lighted within Annette's breast. "!Thus she speaks to a ' simpleton,'" thought she, and then casting her eyes reflectively upon Elizabeth's spare figure, and thin, gray locks, she said plaintively: "When you were young? Ah! yes; but you see that was so long ago, and times have changed very much since then."

It will never do to break off the conversation so abruptly;" but Walter was saving her the trouble of thinking, by asking why she did not go about more into the Village, or over the farm. "There is no particularreason why I should," repied An- nette. "It is very stupid to take an objectless walk by one- self. ,'But what did you do before you came here?" inquired Walter, anxious to find out, if possible, how she had been ac- customed to occupy herself. "Surely you did not sit inthe house at home, as you do under the old chestnut-tree, here?" "No," said Annette. "I was as active and happy as a lark, at home;" and, as the picture of ler former lifereturned to her, she felt her courage rapidly failing, and those traitorous tears very near the surface. Rallying herself with an effort, she added, in a laughing voice:- "Indeed, I remember one time when I rather overdid the matter." "How did that happen?" inquired Walter.

"How did you prevent him from running away?" said Walter. "Oh, I tied a blue ribbon to his collar, but it was more for form's sake than necessity; for he was much too well educated to be guilty of such a breach of decorum," replied Annette. "Where is Pudge to be found?" inquired Elizabeth, casting a scornful glance upon Annette. "He is worth sending for, if he could produce such a marvellous change in your habits." "He is to be found, at present, under the large stone in front of the house where we lived," replied Annette, quietly; "but I doubt if his bones are worth transportation." "In that case we might tie a blue ribbon to ' Lion's' collar," said Elizabeth, sarcastically. "That would be apt to produce an effect other than the one desired," said Walter, with a laugh. "Miss Purden would undoubtedly run, but not after Lion, I fear." "There is not much doubt about that," replied Annette, laughing pleasantly., "I am undeniably afraid of large dogs.

"'Very much worse in regard to manners,' " repeated An- ; nette, with a queer little emphasis, so like Elizabeth's, that Walter nearly choked in his effort to swallow his tea composedly and restrain his laughter. "We must evidently think of some other plan," said he, when he had recovered his composure. "Suppose I provide you with a horse, and then you will be able to at least keep me in sight.", "That would be a capital suggestion if I only knew how to' ride," replied Annette, " but unfortunately I never could sit on a horse. As I get up on one side I always roll off on the other, and as the horse naturally canters away when relieved of its rider, my experience of equestrianismn hitherto - has been that I spend more time on my own feet running after my steed than I do on his back.

"I think I can find something that will answer in my ward- robe," said Annette; " but if I am to be ready by to-morrow morning, I must bid you good-night immediately, and devote my evening to the investigation." "Good-night," said Walter, rising, with unwonted polite- ness, to open the door for her. "She is no simpleton," said he, as he returned to his seat. "Elizabeth, you had better 'strike your colors' whilst there is time, or you will find her more than, your match." "' She is a pert, conceited, intolerable girl!" exclaimed Eliz- abeth, as she arose in wrath from the table. "Having regained the seclusion of her room, Annette seated herself by the window, and triumphantly rehearsed the conver- sation at the tea-table. "I was absolutely impertinent," thought she, with delight; "who would have imagined I could be;" but, as she mused, a vision of her gentle-tempered father passed before her, and her triumph changed into remorse. What would he have said had he witnessed the temper she had exhibited all the evening? Her consdience smote her sorely; and, to escape its rebuking -voice, she hastily overturned the contents of her trunk, in search of a skirt' that would suit her purpose.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        I49 Her deft little fingers worked busily far into the evening, and it was not until she had heard Elizabeth fasten the front door, and exhort Walter not to forget the one in the rear of the house when he had finished his cigar, that she was enabled to put away her working materials with the comfortable conviction that she had been successful. "Yes, I look very nice," she said, as she surveyed her trim figure in the small mirror that hung upon the wall. "I really do look very nice. I wonder what Miss Mordaunt will think of me; something horrible, without doubt. Oh, how wicked I am to-night; I cannot think of her with any charity. I sup- pose she has had her own troubles, and they have made her what she is. I wonder what father did that he was so sorry for.? Perhaps she wanted to marry him, and he ran away; but he surely could not have repented doing that; he ought to have given thanks every time he said his prayers that he escaped such a danger. He said my life here might be hard, because I looked like my mother. Do H look like her? She was very pretty," and she held the candle up to the level of her face to get a better view of it. As she did so the flame shone bright and clear through the open window, forming a streak of light on the dark grass, and attracted the attention of a sombre figure pacing up and down outside. Walter, for it was he, raised his eyes to discover from whence the light came, and, to his great amazement, became a silent spectator of the little scene being enacted by the unconscious Annette. "I am pretty," she said, in a self-satisfied tone, as she turned about on all sides to get a correct view of herself. "I wonder: if Herbert Wellesley noticed it; my hair looks very nice when it hangs about my shoulders," she added, loosening the pins 13*                      - :  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8179-00000073"/> ISO.        ANNETTE; OR, that it might drop; "and now, with a bunch of roses here," and she picked up some fresh buds lying .upon the table and fastened them in her curls, "I really look very well; " and the candle was again raised that she might judge of the effect. She nodded and smiled at herself, so much was she pleased, and then suddenly extinguishing the light, she stood silent in the darkness. "End of 'the bed-room scene,' said Walter, with a laugh. "Who could imagine that little actress-practising before the looking-glass, to be the same' demure kitten that has been ex- citing our sympathy. For whom were those smiles rehearsed? Herbert or myself? The subject becomes quite interesting." "What a miserable little fool I am," said Annette, slowly, as she turned from the miror towards the window. "Of what consequence is it whether I am plain or handsome? There is no one to care about it now; I am alone in the world; yet here have I been standing admiring my own poor face, by the wretched light of a dip candle, whilst Nature, to shame me, is but half revealing hers in the glorious light of the moon. Ah! father darling, were you here, I do-not think you would recog- nize the little girl you so carefully trained!" and, with a sigh, she rested her arms upon the sill, leaning out to watch the moonbeams glistening on the dew drops. "Scene, number two," muttered Walter, as he came -noise- lessly over the grass towards the house. "What is the little witch about now?"                  e ,The " little witch;" remained fixed as a picture in its frame; for her soul had gone wandering into space; and her heart was sadly recalling the time when she was dear to herself, for being so dear to another. When she decked herself to appear fair to a partial father's eye, and wreathed her lips in Smiles to meet his dear caress. Nevermore, nevermore, in this world could   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.          151 this happiness be hers; but the beauty of the night, and the solemn grandeur of the heavens, seemed to hold all violent grief in abeyance; speaking in eloquent silence of that better land, where those she loved had gone before. Upward she gazed, with an ever-increasing longing to pierce the mystery of the blue vault above her, and hold communion with the dead, if indeed it were Paradise. Idly she strained her eyes; the gates opened not; and the stars seemed to be looking down at her in cold surprise. "Alas!" she murmured, "my darling cannot come to me; but some day I shall go to him; aye, I shall see him once again; " and then, raising her head once more from her hands, in which she had buried it in the excess of her emotion, her lips parted, and the beautiful melody of an old Scotch song, floated on the evening breeze. Motionless as a statue stood Walter beneath the window, as the pure, true voice of the singer was -wafted down to him, singing with inexpressible pathos, words which, in themselves, were beautiful without the aid of music: ( Wae is my heart, and the tear 's in my ee; Lang, lang, joy 's been'a stranger to me: Forsaken and friendless my burden I bear, And the sweet voice o' pity ne'er sounds in my ear. Love, thou hast pleasures; and deep hae I loved; Love, thou last sorrows, and sair, hae I proved; But this bruised heart, that now bleeds iri my breast, I can feel its throbbings will soon-be at rest." Walter was a passionate lover of music, and even after the last lingering note had died away, he remained spell-bound, -gazing intently at the figure in the window above him.

But a few moments before, Annette had seemed to be a vain little coquette, practising before the looking-glass; a few hours before, a pert, uncivil school-girl; in the fore-part of the eve- ning, nothing more than a great cry-baby; and now? she was sublime! No trace of childishness upon her face, nor even of girlhood; but the stamp of a woman's passionate, loving soul! and, in her voice, a depth and music that went straight from her heart to his own. He felt a longing to befriend her; to take her in his arms and soothe her. A bat flew past the window. Annette started from her dream, and a white rose-bud fell from her hair upon the grass at Walter's feet. Silently she withdrew into the room; and he, scarcely know- ing what he did, stooped as he turned away to pick up the flower. Surely some potent spell had been imprisoned in this little rose, for scarcely had he taken it in his hand ere his heart began to beat more rapidly, and eager thoughts to rush crowding through his brain. Long after he had closed his eyes, and composed himself to slumber, he could still perceive its sweet perfume; and even when sleep had stolen his other senses, it pervaded all his dreams-gilding them with moonlight, love, and melody.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         I53 CHAPTER XVII: TEMPEST AND SUNSHNE. WHEN Walter arose the next morning, it was with com- plex feelings that he reviewed the scene of the evening before. He would have been tempted to consider it all a dream, born of his own disordered brain, had not the bud, now fast becoming a rose in the little vase on the table beside his bed, borne silent testimony to its reality. "By Jove!" he said to himself, "I think I must have been moonstruck last night, or that little devil bewitched me. It is -to be devoutly hoped that she does not wear that face by daylight, for she will be my ruin if she does." One glance at Annette, as she entered the breakfast-room, served to remove any uneasiness on that score, for she returned his good-morning with a little nod of her head, and was again the awkward school-girl. He could scarcely restrain a sigh of disappointment at the loss of his ideal-vision, whilst he realized how much better it was for him that it should fade with the stars in the morning light.  "I am all ready," exclaimed Annette, as they left the break- fast-table. "You have only to name the hour that Sir Rodger will be in waiting and I will be punctual." ' Shall we say half-past. ten, then?" said Walter, smiling at her eagerness. "That will do very well," replied Annette. "It will give me time to take my lesson, and recover my composure before dinner.                       -  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8179-00000075"/> I54        ANNETTE; OR, "I suppose I may look for some one else to visit Widow Green, since you have found a new occupation?" said Eliz-- abeth, in steely tones from the head of the table. "Oh, dear!" exclaimed Annette, "I forgot all about Widow Green. Of course, I will go to her as usual; we can have our ride in the afternoon, can we not?" she said, turning to Walter. "Certainly," he replied, "unless Widow Green can wait until the afternoon; and, in that case, we could hold by our original plan."                 - "Widow Green would be none the worse this time next week for the want of my visit," said Annette in a very low voice, looking laughingly into Walter's face, " for I am of no earthly use to her; but, if I do not go, my own character will suffer in the eyes of your estimable sister. 'Duty before pleasure.' lWe will ride this afternoon; " and she tripped gaily away to get her bonnet. A short time after, as Walter was leaning idly against the ver- andah, reading the newspaper, a trim little figure, with a large green umbrella, a huge basket, a nosegay and a paper parcel, came down the gravel walk leading toward the Village. "Are you off?" he asked, as she came up to him. "Yes," she replied, "I am ' under weigh,' and with wind and tide in my favor, I may make port sometime before mid- night." "I thought you were a faster craft," said Walter, laughing. "When I am not so heavily freighted," replied Annette, "1 get along pretty well, but to-day I fear shipwreck." "Why, you poor child," said Walter, as he looked at her again,!" you can never carry all those things. Is it necessary? Are they indispensable to the old lady's comfort?" "Utterly so," said Annette. "Your sister has just been convincing me of it."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       I55 "Well, let me go with you a part of the way and help you to carry them," said Walter. '"Oh! will you?" cried Annette, in delight. ' That will be very nice indeed. Which of my burdens will you take?" ," Give me the basket and the umbrella,' replied Walter, "and you may carry the others yourself." These having changed. hands, they started on their road to Widow Green's. "Will you be so kind as to tell me what it is that I am car- rying?" inquired Walter, as they sauntered along. "A basket," replied Annette, in a matter-of-fact tone. "That is self-evident," said Walter. "What I wish to know is what the basket contains." "Then you should have asked for a list of contents," re- plied Annette. "There is nothing so important as speaking pure English when you wish to be understood." "I shall endeavor to remember that in the future," replied Walter, " if you will be so good as to pardon the past and give me a ' list of contents ' now." "A piece of pork, a pound of lard, some cheese, a handful of dried apples, a loaf of brown bread, a pat of butter, and a bunch of herbs, for ' herb-tea, " replied Annette. "And what is the use of all these things? The list sounds like a motley assemblage of good, bad, and indifferent," said Walter. "That just shows how much you know about it," replied Annette. "It appears to me that your sister has provided for all Widow Green's wants, temporal and spiritual, for at least a week.," "I can feel the force' of your remark by the weight of the basket, in regard to the temporal wants," said Walter; " but, pray, where is the spiritual food?"  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8179-00000076"/> I56        ANNETTE; OR,  "In this parcel," replied Annette, deftly unfolding a number of tracts: Look before you leap," "The sinners' doom," "Why are you not a Christian?" "Awake, thou that sleepest." "That will do," exclaimed Walter, laughing. "Surely the spiritual appetite of the whole human race can be satisfied by the contents of that parcel; but what are the flowers for?" 'They are a contribution of my own," replied Annette, "and are for a purpose of which your sister does not approve." "Which is?" said Walter, interrogatively,-- "To afford the poor woman a little pleasure," replied An- nette, "which Miss Mordaunt considers superfluous charity to rich or poor. In her dictionary, pleasure is but another term for idleness." "She is not over generous in that particular, I must admit," said Walter. "Her own existence has been so entirely devoid of it that she considers life to be but a weary pilgrimage, at best, and that he who has the least pleasure here will have the most hereafter. I fear, however, that she has made you suffer through these remarkable opinions." "I have no right to call myself a victimn," said Annette. "Did she not give me a home when none other offered, without ever having seen me even? So far from complaining of her, I should be filled with gratitude."' "Notwithstanding, you are not," said Walter, with a laugh. "When are we what we ought to be?" replied Annette, with a rueful smile. "I mUSt confess that I do not feel as grateful as I should, but it is because I am convinced that she person- ally dislikes me, and only shelters me through charity." "That is nonsense," said Walter. '"In the first place, you are not an object of charity, whilst you are possessed of suffic- ient means to live anywhere, and with whom you please; and, in the second place, I do not think Elizabeth dislikes you; '   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       I57 thirdly, even if she did, it is in my house that you are living, and not hers."  "I did not know that before I came here," said Annette, blushing painfully. "I am sure you will believe that I never would have forced myself upon you uninvited, had I known," she continued, looking piteously up into his face. "I cannot imagine your forcing yourself upon any one," said Walter, kindly; " and, in return, I hope you will believe that you are now, and ever will be, a welcome guest in my house, Is this not Widow Green's?"he added, as he paused before a low wooden house, fronting on the road, with a tiny plot of ground before it, called by courtesy a garden. "Yes," said Annette, unlatching the little gate; "this is where she lives. I will take the basket and go in alone, if you please, for the sight of a stranger always excites the, old lady. Good-bye, and many, many thanks, not only for carrying the basket, but for-- for - everything," she continued, placing her hand in his and looking up gratefully into ihis face. "When shall you be ready to go home," said Walter. "If you will not be here very long, I will borrow your umbrella to save me from sun-stroke, and go for the letters and papers, after which I will return and see you safely home again," "Fifteen minutes will be as long as- I shall want to stay," replied Annette. "My conversational powers will be ex- hausted by that time, and I shall be only too happy to be called for, if it will not inconvenience you to come." "You may expect me," said Walter, handing her the basket, and holding the gate open for her to pass through; " so look out for me in fifteen minutes." Annette nodded an assent, and tripped up the walk as lightly 'as one so heavily laden could.

Reading in such a high key was out of the question; there- fore Annette contented herself with placing the tracts upon the table, and then busied herself unpacking the basket and arrang- ing the flowers, glancing continually down the high-road, as she did so, to catch the first glimpse of her deliverer. Fifteen, twenty minutes passed, and Walter did not appear; but, as the half-hour struck, and Annette was just relinquishing all hope that he would return, ,the green umbrella "hove" in sight. Annette sprang up in delight, and darted out of the house to meet him half-way. "So you really have come back for me," she said, as she joined him, a -little smile of pleasure rippling over her face. "I began to think that you had forgotten me." "If one desires to be properly appreciated," said Walter, "Iet him keep some one waiting." "I should have appreciated you quite as much had you come fifteen minutes sooner," said Annette. "Appreciated me, or my letters?" said Walter, holding up one he had just been reading. "What will you give me for this? Own, now, that it was the mail you were so impatient to see, and not my unworthy self." "I will do no such thing," said Annette; "for it is not true. Why should I care about your letters? What interest have I in them?" "You do not, then, care to see a letter of four pages from Mr. Herbert Wellesley?" said Walter. "You have no interest in that gentleman?"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       I59 "I did not know who your letter was from," said Annette, blushing. "Of course I would like to know how he is." "Ah! you really would," said Walter, teasingly. "Do you think it is wise, now, to continue to think about a man whom you have not seen for some weeks? Perhaps this is an invita-: tion to his wedding." "In that case it will give me pleasure to accept it," replied Annette. "I have no doubt of it," said Walter. "You could walk over a bed of live coals, with apparent pleasure, if you were as angry as you were last night." "How did you know I was angry?" inquired Annette, ill confusion. "How did I know?" repeated Walter. "Why, my dear child, your face is like a book'; 'he who runs may read;' besides, you never could have said the sharp things you did, had you not been very angry." "You know nothing at all about me," said Annette, feeling very hot and uncomfortable. "I have been entirely unlike myself ever since I came here, and you never saw me before." "I am a clever student," replied Walter, "and, notwith- standing your assurance to the contrary, feel convinced that I know you quite well. Can you deny that you entered the tea- room last night in a smiling rage?" "No; I cannot," said Annette, slowly and unwillingly. "I certainly was very angry, but I had great provocation." "Who provoked you," inquired Walter. "I will not tell you," replied Annette. "I shall discover, nevertheless," said Walter. "You will not," replied Annette, shortly. "Notus vertons," said Walter; "meantime I suppose I may as well put my letter in my pocket, as you care nothing about it."  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8179-00000078"/> I60        ANNETTE; OR, "I never said that," exclaimed Annette.

"My interest in Mr. Wellesley will not be lessened by his marriage," said Annette, 6' but rather increased, if anything." "Dear, dear," ejaculated Walter, in apparent concern, "I had no idea the case was so hopeless. I doubt whether it would be right to 'fan the flame' by giving you his letter to read. As a strict moralist, I think I really ought to discourage such a sentiment as you have expressed." ' You are the most aggravating creature I ever met with!" exclaimed Annette. "You distort everything one says; read your letter, or keep it to yourself. It is of no great consequence to me which you do." "There, there," said Walter, soothingly. "Don't get your- self into a passion; in the words of another, ' Its little hands were never made to scratch its neighbor's eyes out.' Are you really so very anxious for the letter? Perhaps, if I did pen- ance for a week, I might expiate the sin of having allowed you to read it." No answer. "What is -the matter?" continued Walter.   ' Won't you speak to me?"  Still no response. "What did you :say?" he went on, "that you could not eat your dinner until you had read it? Here, then, take it; I cannot be so hard-hearted as to keep it from you any longer." "I said nothing of the kind! and you know very well that I did not!" exclaimed Annette, indignantly. Walter laughed heartily at her discomfiture, and maliciously folded the letter and put it away "Ah, well,"' he said, " do not let us quarrel about so unim- portant a persion as Mr. Wellesley.

Annette did not echo his remark in regard to the walk, but, turning from him, entered the house in hot haste, without vouchsafing a reply. ' She will not speak to me for a week," said he, with a smile.

She had a quick temper, it is true; but -her anger was short- lived, and she was incapable of cherishing ill-will against an offender for any length of time; besides which, on occasions when her anger interfered with her interests, she could, at will, smother out the flame entirely. This was the case in the present instance. Her curiosity was aroused by Walter's parting remark in regard to Herbert, and with it was mingled just a little jealousy.

He has not had time to be fascinated by anything more substantial than a pretty face. .I hope your ' doll' will not disappoint you, sir," she said, scornfully; and then added, in a compassionate tone, "poor child, I am sorry for her, if she loves such an inconstant creature as Herbert Wellesley. Myself yesterday, you to-day, my dear; and some one else to-morrow. This is the sum of his affection ; but what do I care? He may love a hundred girls if he so desires. I should really like to know what kind of a girl she is, though!" And the more she thought about it, the more she regretted that she had quarrelled with Walter, and thus lost the opportu- nity of reading for herself the impassioned words written by her sometime lover of another and later favorite, until, at last, she determined to put aside her anger for a more convenient season, and coax the letter from him with fair smiles and smooth words; hence, her surprising amiability when they next met. Her serenity remained undisturbed throughout the meal, and it was still with a beaming countenance that she appeared upon the verandah, in the latter part of the afternoon, equipped for her first riding lesson. "Will my dress answer?" she inquired, demurely, casting a half-glance at Walter from under her long lashes, to see the effect she produced upon him. "The little coquette," said he to himself, taking in the "tout ensemble " at a glance, and recalling the scene of the evening before. "Oh, yes; I suppose it will, until you can get something better," he said aloud, in a very dubious tone. "What is the matter with it? asked Annette, sharply. "I do not see anything particularly the matter with it," he \:   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       i63 - replied calmly, "but you seemed so doubtful about it yourself  that I took it for granted it was not all right. Men know so much less about these things than women." "Do they? ' said Annette, brusquely. "Don't they?" responded Walter. "Perhaps you are right in regard to yourself," replied An- nette, "but I think Mr. Wellesley would have known whether I looked well or not." "Whetheryou looked well or not," repeated Walter. "Oh, that is another question; why don't you speak 'pure English,' I.  and then I could understand you. Why not have said plainly, 'pay me a compliment,' and then I would have known what to say."  "What would you have said?" inquired Annette, with an-i - other demure glance, being utterly unable to resist the desire to know what he really thought of her. "Just what the looking-glass did last night," replied Walter, looking at her with eyes sparkling with merriment. "What do you mean?" she stammered, looking at him in dismay. "You do not know, I suppose," said Walter, enjoying her confusion. "You never even heard of a young lady who stood before the looking-glass last evening, for. fifteen or twenty minutes, admiring herself; holding the candle first on one side then on the other, to catch the full effect of her charms." Poor Annette! the blood rushed up to her face in a crimson tide, as she stood with drooping head, speechless with mortifi- cation. "Come! let me put you on your horse," said Walter, after a moment's pause, during which he regarded her with infinite amusement, and without further delay they approached the steps beside which Sir Rodger was patiently standing.  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8179-00000080"/> I64        ANNETTE; OR, The riding-lesson passed off very well, much to Annette's surprise. Walter placed her carefully upon the horse, nor would he allow her to start until she-felt 'herself securely seated. After which he walked the animal slowly around the lawn, with a hand on its bridle, until, her timidity overcome, she felt quite at home upon its back, and wondered at her former fears. "Let me go a little way by myself," she said, after they had been around the garden several times. "You must be tired, and I feel sufficient confidence now in Sir Rodger's sobriety to admit of my venturing alone." "I am glad that you appreciate him so well," replied Wal- ter, loosening his hold of the bridle, but continuing to walk by her side. "I have proved him well; he is an animal worthy of trust.' "Then why will you not leave me to his tender mercies?" said Annette. "Pray go and sit down." I am not tired," replied Walter, " and although I do not think any harm would come to you if I did leave you, yet, if you have no objections, I shall feel more comfortable walking by your side." A few more rounds, and then Annette insisted upon getting off, if he would hnot leave her to herself, declaring that he would be worn out if he continued to walk any longer. "You have done very well," said Walter, as he lifted her from. the saddle, "and will, in time, be a very good horsewo- man, if not a reckless one. Come, Rodger," he added, swings ing himself upon the animal's back, "you have shown how gentle and good you can be, now give us a specimen of your speed." Rodger needed neither whip nor spur to urge him on, and almost before Annette realized that Walter had mounted, horse and rider had disappeared.   THE CHRONICLES O,F BELLEVUE.       165 Annette returned to the house in a very humble state of mind. Her discomfiture was great at the discovery that Walter had witnessed her folly of the preceding evening. He had been so attentive and kind through the day that she believed he was beginning to enjoy her society, but it appeared that he had, as usual, been amusing himself at her expense, only in a different way. "What an absurd fool he must think me!" she said to her- self. "Standing before the glass, lost in admiration of myself!  I wish any one else had seen me; yes, even Miss Mordaunt. How he must despise my vanity and me; and I deserve that he should, for I certainly was very much pleased with myself last night, although I do not usually spend much thought on my appearance, or rather did not, at home; but I have changed so much since I came here that I scarcely know myself." Thus she ruminated, until the increasing shadows warned her to prepare for tea. "Walter," said Elizabeth, as they sat around the tea-table a short time after this, "do you ever hear fropn Mr. Wellesley?" "Oh, yes," replied Walter; "he writes to me frequently." "What has he been doing all this time?" inquired Elizabeth. "What most young clergymen do when they have no prop- erty, and no prospect of a charge." "What is that?" asked Elizabeth, whilst Annette looked up expectantly. 'Falling in love," replied Walter. "Indeed!" exclaimed Elizabeth, with interest. "Do you know anything of the young lady?"  X "I have seen her," said Walter, carelessly. "Have you?" exclaimed Annette, eagerly. "What does she look like? is she pretty?" "That is a difficult question to answer," replied Walter;  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC8179-00000081"/> I66        ANNETTE; OR, {' for beauty is a matter of taste, and my opinion is of course worth nothing, as I am no judge of it. If you will accept Mr. Wellesley's, she is 'an angel,' in every respect." "Of course he thinks so," said Annette, contemptuously; "but it does not follow that she is. I should prefer a more unprejudiced opinion." "Well, you ought to know the style of person he admires," said Walter, " he seemed determined to enlighten you on the subject the last afternoon he passed here." Annette looked up in alarm. How much did Walter know? Had his sharp eyes detected the act with which Herbert had sealed their compact? or was he sending a random shot, with the hope of bringing down fresh game? She could discover nothing from his face, and her position was rendered more un- comfortable by the consciousness that Elizabeth's eyes were fixed upon her, with an eager, penetrating gaze. "Did Mr. Wellesley mention his future plans to you?" asked Elizabeth at length. "Did he speak of this young lady?" "No! oh, no!" replied Annette, hastily. "He said noth- ing about her; I do not know of what Mr. Westhrooke is speaking." "You do not?" said Walter, interrogatively, "that is very strange; may I ask, then, the subject of your prolonged inter- view under the chestnut-tree?" "We conversed on a variety of subjects," replied Annette, "none of which would be interesting to you, however." "And he did not mention that he admired any one?" said Walter. "How you do tease!" exclaimed Annette, flushed and ex- cited. "Why should I repeat his conversation to you? I do not think what he said to me concerns any one but myself."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       i67, "But it does concern you," said Elizabeth, fixing her gray eyes upon her. "Had you any reason to suppose yourself an object of admiration to Mr. Wellesley?" "No particular reason,'" said Annette, confusedly. "He has always been very kind to me, and we parted very good friends, but he never told me he admired me." "Ah, well," said Walter, rising from the table, "sometimes admiration is expressed without words; and sometimes it is taken for granted, when one knows one is young, pretty, and deserving of it," he added, with a mischievous glance at An- nette, as he left the room. Annette was about to follow, when Elizabeth called her back. "My dear,.' she said, as Annette stood beside her, "your blushes and confusion lead me to suppose that you are interested in this young Mr. Wellesley. Is it so? Excuse the question, but I stand towards you as mother, fatheri and guardian, all in one, and I would not have your life marred through a mistaken fancy. If there is any understanding between you, be candid and confess it, and I will at once send for the young man, and have everything suitably and honorably arranged, as I should suppose your father would wish."    i "I assure you there is no understanding between us, in the sense you mean," exclaimred Annette, horrified at the mere mention of sending for Herbert to come and marry her, when his heart was given to another. "He never asked me to marry him; indeed, he did not; he only asked me to let him be my- friend, and I agreed." "Well," said Elizabeth, "I only speak that I may be-- in time, child; do not throw your heart away upon one who will not value it; but, soon wearying of his toy, throw it aside for a newer one.

"God help them both!" said Annette, shudderingly. "No," said Elizabeth, with a bitter laugh, " the man needs no help; he turns, as lightly as a butterfly, to sip the sweets of another flower, and with as little remorse; but the woman! - the woman, Annette; flung back upon herself, her wealth of love vainly squandered, all her best feelings trampled under foot, -loses all hope in life, all faith in man, and ofttimes all trust in God." Elizabeth's head sank upon her breast. Her last words seemed to be uttered more to herself than to Annette, and, indeed, she seemed to have forgotten her presence altogether. Annette's heart was touched with genuine sympathy and affection, as she looked upon Elizabeth's emotion. "Can she have loved my father?" she thought, and under the influence of this suggestion, her former animosity melted away like frost when exposed to the sun, and drawing nearer to Elizabeth, she put her arms affectionately around her, and imprinted a kiss upon her forehead; after which, alarmed at her audacity, she made haste out of the room before Elizabeth had time to remark upon-the unwonted caress. * f,   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       169 CHAPTER     XI, -., A FATHER-CONFESSOR. A NNETTE passed hurriedly through the hall, and on to the terrace beyond, where the moon was just rising in its dull red splendor. She went out, she knew not wherefore, unless it was to cool her flushed cheeks and recover her composure; for her mind was tossed about by'a thousand conflicting, feel- ings, the strongest of which was compunction for the hard thoughts she had hitherto entertained towards both brother and sister. They had arisen from her want of knowledge of their characters; for Elizabeth, although outwardly cold, was far from hard-hearted, and bad Walter once realized how sensitive were Annette's feelings, she would have had no further reason to complain of him.        ; This she now began to understand, and was, as usual, remorse- ful for the past. Turning from the door, she sauntered down the garden-path, reflecting on these things, when all at once a tiny spark of light among the bushes attracted her attention, and led her over the grass to discover from whence it came. In the open space beyond she found Walter leaning negligently against a tree, enjoying the double pleasure of a beautiful even- ing and a fine cigar. She watched him silently for a few moments from a distance, and then, yielding to an irresistible impulse, she noiselessly, approached him, and laid her hand upon his arm. Starting with surprise, Walter looked down, and his wonder- ing glaze fell upon a pair of sad, wistful eyes, looking up at him through a mist of unshed tears. ,I5  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC8179-00000083"/> I70       ANNETTE; OR, "Why, my dear child!" he exclaimed, turning towards her in genuine concern. "What has happened? Has Elizabeth said anything to distress you?" "No; oh, no," replied Annette; "but I am so distressed and mortified to think how pert and disagreeable I have been to you both."        - "Bless my soul! i" said Walter, very much relieved, " is that all? I thought from the melancholy expression of your face that you must certainly have received a scolding. What a ten- der conscience you must have, to be so overwhelmed by such small sins. For my part, I cannot remember you as being either pert or disagreeable; but, as I am learning manners, I dare not contradict a lady's statement; let the fact remain, therefore- only be so kind as to consider yourself magnani- mously forgiven." "You do not know all," said Annette, sadly, " or you would not be so ready to forgive. I have had such unjust thoughts of you and your sister, not to mention what I have said. You cannot imagine how wicked I have been." o "I suppose not," said Walter, with an odd twinkle in his eye. "Come, tell me all about it. Make me your father-con- fessor, and I will promise to make your penance light." So saying, he drew her hand within his arm, and began to stroll slowly up and down the terrace. : "To begin with, then," said Annette, looking confidingly up into his face: "I overheard Miss Mordaunt speaking of me to you one afternoon, when I was sitting under the chestnut- tree, and I flew into a dreadful passion. Oh, how I raved and stormed. It would have frightened you had you seen me." "I have no doubt of it," said Walter, in a smothered voice, "your mentioning it even makes me tremble, go on quickly to something else."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        171. ' Don't you remember the next?" said Annette, dolefully, "how dreadfully impertinent I was that evening? I positively hated Miss Mordaunt, for a little while, and: when I went to- my room afterwards, felt absolutely pleased at my behavior instead of being very much ashamed." "That was very wicked," said Walter. "We must class that under the head of ' unrepented sins.' Which is the next in order?"           - "Ah, the next I shall never forget," replied Annette, " nor you, either, I am afraid." "Of course I know what it is," said Walter, "but I must, as your father-confessor, insist upon your confessing it openly." "It is vanity,' said Annette, with a blush, " as exemplified by my standing surveying myself in the mirror, where you caught me." "But looking at yourself in the mirror is no sin," said Wal- ter. "How else could you determine whether your dress fitted or rot? I will r-ot allow you to class -that under the head of vanity." "I got up to look at my dress," said Annette, growing hotter and redder- as she spoke; '; but--but--I stayed there after- wards, thinking how nice I looked." "What depravity," said Walter, solemnly.   "Admiring yourself in the looking-glass; absolutely thinking yourself good-looking, I have no doubt. You surely do not expect abso- lution for this? Do you suppose any little girl was ever so wicked before?" and then, giving up all restraint, he laughed heartily, saying: "Annette, you little monkey! are you making game of me, by a false confession, or are these really the grievous sins over the commission of which you are making yourself miserable?" Annette looked up at him in surprise.  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC8179-00000084"/> t72        ANNETTE; OR, 'Making game of you i " she said. "I do not know what you mean; indeed, I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Why do you laugh?" she continued, with- quivering lip. "' Do you not believe me?" and two bright tears made their way down her cheeks as she spoke, despite her efforts to the con- trary. Walter looked at her in genuine distress. He had no idea of hurting her feelings by his words, and in fact, up to that time, had believed her to be as much inrjest as himself; but her unhappiness was too plainly written on her face to be mis- understood, and he was deeply touched at the childish inno- cence that made so much of trifling faults. "Annette! Annette!" he exclaimed, moved for once by the sight of tears. "Now, I really will scold you, if you cry. If I laughed at you it was not in unkindness, but in amusement at your calling such little peccadilloes by the formidable name of 'sins.' I scarcely thought you were in earnest at first, and- took your confession as a little piece of coquetry, but a glance at your face satisfies me of my mistake, and I can only excuse it by saying that I have never met any one the least like you before, and did not even know that such women existed. It has been my lot to be thrown with artificial women, who lived but to attract attention, and were never happy unless feeding their vanity by self-admiration, or the adulation of others, and ; I thought you onf of the same class." "And- you were right," said Annette, "I have been every bit as bad as the worst of them, but I will not be so any more." "No; I was not right," said Walter. "I was very wrong to mistake a guileless girl's innocent pleasure, in her youth and beauty, for the conventional greed of the woman of the world, who inspects herself, as a merchant does his wares, counting each charm so much gain. Lift up your head, child; you have   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        173 nothing to reproach yourself with. The sins of your whole life would make but a spotless page, when compared with a single day of mine." "You are very good to say so," said Annette, "'but every one of your kind words condemns me more, for my miscon- ception of your character. I am always too hasty to judge others; it is my besetting sin. Ah! do not tell me I have nothing to repent of." "Far be it from me to say that," replied Walter, in a voice full of feeling, " for to repent of small sins is to avoid large ones, whilst negligence in that respect deadens the conscience, and from bad we go to worse. Repent each night the little sins that each day chronicles; and then, when the sun of life shall set, and the night cometh on apace, there will be no long arrearages to be made up, no back debts to be paid." Silently they now continued to walk side by side up and down the terrace. Annette glanced once or twice at Walter, but his knit brows, and utter abstraction, deterred her from. speaking, lest she should interrupt his reflections. She won- dered what he could be thinking of, and waited patiently for a little while for him to break the silence, but he strode on, seemingly oblivious of her presence, and, becoming weary at last, she determined to silently withdraw and go to her room; but, as she moved away, Walter seemed suddenly to awake from his dream. "Are you going in?" he said. "It seems a shame to pass such a beautiful evening in-doors."          - Annette stood still undecidedly, arid murmured somethinig to . the effect that the evening was already far spent. "Ah, yes. It is growing late, I suppose," said Walter, with a sigh. "Well, if it must be so, good-night, and good-bye ;" and, taking her hand in his, he pressed it warmly. i5+*  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC8179-00000085"/> I74      '  ANNETTE; OR, "Good-bye," echoed Annette, in surprise. "Are you going away then?" "Yes," replied Walter, "I am off to New York to-morrow. Can I execute any commissions for you? Have you any letters or messages to send to absent friends?" "No, thank you, nothing; " replied Annette, blushing. "I do not know of any one who would care to hear from me." "Ah! but I do," replied Walter, with a smile. "Come, be generous, and give me a few lines for the poor fellow; they will make him happy for a week." "He must be a very ' poor fellow,' if it takes so little to make him happy," said Annette, with a light-hearted laugh. "When do you expect to return?" "As soon as possible," replied Walter. "A few days I hope will conclude my business, but at any rate a week or two will suffice. Will you think of me now and then while I am absent, and send after me a kindly wish for a safe and speedy return? or have I made myself too disagreeable to you to admit of this?" "My best wishes for your safety you carry with you," replied Annette; "but," she added, looking archly at hiln, "do not ask me to think of you if you are to be away a week or two, for you convinced me this morning how unwise it is to waste one's time in-such an unprofitable manner. You may, perhaps, O return with a wife; more improbable things have happened." "I doubt it," said Walter, with a smile. "Nous verrons," said Annette, laughing, and turning from him she entered the house. Long after she had gone, Walter remained plunged in a gloomy retrospection. It was as though Annette had brought him face to face with his own lost youth, and it lay before him like a map, all the paths he should have taken marked out in a   THE'CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       175 pale blue ink, while the way he had actually gone, and the bitter mistakes he had made, were traced in indelible crimson.-  He had never been a bad man at heart; on the contrary, there had been much of promise in his early youth, but "wheat and tares" had been sown together, and the tares had destroyed much good grain. His sins were more of weakness than intent; never had he wilfully injured any one; but a want of self-con- trol pervaded all his actions. It had been so easy to let the pleasant hours go by without taking heed to them, save to cull flowers by the wayside, and, at the, time, he had but one thought, how best to enjoy him- self, and make life fly on golden wings. Then, from one misstep to another, he could see himself clambering up the ladder of life, until he lost his footing alto- gether, and plunged headlong into the abyss of misery, where he now stood. Why had he taken those cross-paths, which stood out now boldly to the sight, like scarecrows in a cornfield'? Why had he not followed the straight, even path, so delicately yet so firmly traced to his now discerning eye? Why had he not re- strained himself while there was time, instead of allowing his hot passions to run riot until they had ruined him? Oh! could he but go back and take that false move over, what a different ending would he not make to this game of life! But, alas; there is no retrograde movement in life. A step once taken cannot be retraced; a move once made can never! be recalled. There are some moments that all the waters of Lethe can never obliterate from our memories, and it is but "Dead-Sea fruit" to dream of what might have been.

Thus Walter sat and mused over his past youth and vanished : hopes. The shades of evening deepened into night; the little birds slept in the trees; all animal nature was hushed in repose, save the loathsome bats which eddied in circles through the air; no sound broke the deep silice save the mournful cry of the night-bird, which was echoed in his heart; and still he sat with bowed head, communing with the past. , CHAPTER XX. WHCH WAS RIGHT? THE next few days passed blithely for Annette. She had set herself the task of healing the wound in Elizabeth's heart, caused, Annette felt convinced, by her father; and her tender, sympathetic nature rejoiced in this service of love. Occupation was necessary to her happiness, without it she was miserable. Were the task she set herself ever so, unpleas- ant, she would sing gaily over it, and seem positively to enjoy the trouble she was taking; thus it afforded her actual pleasure to fight Elizabeth's antipathy to herself, by surrounding her with love, watching anxiously over her comfort, and anticipating her wishes by a thousand acts of loving thoughtfulness. Elizabeth's heart was not adamant, and by degrees she yielded to the influence of Annette's affectionate care. It was something new to her to feel herself of so much importance; hitherto, she had been the one to wait on others, and had never experienced the pleasure of being waited on before.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       !" Mrs. Green's " day " returned, and Annette as she prepared for her visit, could not but remember how ungracious she had beeh, on the last one, to her kind escort. "He will be amply revenged to-day," she said, as she X weighed the well-packed basket on her arm. "It is actually heavier than when he carried it for me, and there is no one to help -me with it now. - I wish I had not been so cross, and frightened him away; he was good for carrying bundles and baskets, if for nothing else. Ah, well, shoulder arms! I sup- pose I must manage by myself."             " Such was not the case, however; for Walter, as well as her- self, had remembered Mrs. Green's " day; " and before the door she found Sir Rodger, in a bran-new harness, attached to a pretty little wagon, low and easy to turn; and, at her exclama- tion of surprise, the man at the horse's head stepped forward, respectfully, and raised his hat, saying: "Mr. Westhrooke left orders, Miss, for me to bring this wagon round for you to-day, and he said, if you please, that you was not to ride till he came back, for fear of some acci- dent; but if you would like to learn how to drive yourself, I1 was to teach you. The wagon would be handy, he said, to carry your parcels in." "Oh, how nice," exclaimed Annette, with delight, as she watched her basket being stowed away in the bottom of the wagon, and then sprung in after it. "Do you think I shall ever be able to drive by myself?" "Oh, yes, Miss," replied the man; a baby could drive Sir Rodger; " and, to her great satisfaction, he handed her the reins and mounted up behind her. Away went steady Rodger, at a good trot, and proved himself quite equal to the occasion, carefully avoiding all pitfalls, wait- ing patiently for gates to be opened and shut, apparently dis- composed by nothing.

Every time she got into it she tried to think of some way in which to return his goodness, and inwardly determined that he should never 'make her angry with him again, whatever he might say or do. Meanwhile Walter had safely arrived at his destination, and taken 'quarters' with Herbert, who was undisguisedly glad to see him. "Tell me about Miss Purden," said Herbert, the first greet- ings over, after they had comfortably established themselves in his room to smoke the ' evening pipe of peace.' "How is she?" 1 "As well as she can be, and as merry as a cricket," re- sponded Walter. "She has not missed you at all, old fellow; I have been-so entertaining." "I do not know that that is the most pleasant intelligence you could give me," said Herbert, laughing. "I should pre- fer to hear that I was not so entirely forgotten." !"Oh,she has no chance to forget you," said Walter. "I talk about you incessantly. I think I deserve a great deal of credit for it, too; for it would be much pleasanter to make love on my own account. She is decidedly good-looking." 'Herbert looked up uneasily. "Do not do that, Walter," he said, "or I shall have no, chance at all. You have-a certain way with you, that bespeaks experience in these matters, and tells very much with girls." You need not be afraid," replied Walter. "A wife would be about as useful to me as a fifth wheel to a coach. I am not a marrying man," "Take care she does not fall in love with you, then," said   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       1I9 Herbert. "It would be far easier to give her to you, Walter, than to forgive you, if you broke her heart." ( I will not do that, you may depend upon it," replied Wal- ter; " but you must make haste and come after her yourself. It is nothing but confounded nonsense this wasting your youth at the tread-mill of what you call duty, when a home and happi- ness are to be had for the asking."' "You do not know me as well as I knpw myself," said Her- bert, with a sigh. "If I should marry now, I should be good for naught. My mind and heart would be centered in the woman I called my wife, and I would be unable to settle to any regular work. When I have become accustomed to the routine of my present life, it will be time enough to think of other things."                  - "Meanwhile, what is to become of the poor girl? Do you suppose her love can live on the scrap of comfort that you left with her?" said Walter. "It will not be more than six months,i at the farthest," replied Herbert, " before I shall feel myself at liberty to address her." "Six months i" exclaimed Walter. "Great heavens! are you a man, and in love, and speak thus dispassionately of an exile of six months from the woman you love? What changes may not take place in six months? In six months--in six days - in six hours - aye, in six minutes, a man may lose la woman's heart." "That depends very much upon the woman," said Herbert, cheerfully. "I would be willing to stake my all on Annette's fidelity. She is so earnest, so loving, so true! A woman's soul dwells in her child-like form. You do not know her." "Do I not?" said Walter, and a strange look passed over his face.

Woman is by nature fickle; she veers around with the wind, and she needs heavy ballast to keep her heart in place. Your little girl is doubtless all that you describe her, and were she actually engaged to marry you, would probably keep her word; that promise would act as ballast; but you have left her without even the direct knowledge of your love for her, and expect her to remain true to a shadow, for six months or more! It is unreasonable!" "She will stand the test, notwithstanding," replied Herbert, confidently. "If she were in a convent, or had a hump upon her back, she might," said Walter, sharply. "You cannot destroy my faith in her," replied Herbert, " or induce me to bind her by a promise to do that which, perhaps, without it, she would leave undone. If she love me, I have said enough to keep her true; but if, meantime,.a more fortunate man than myself shall win her affections, no bond of my forging shall separate them." "You are an absolute fool!" exclaimed Walter, angrily, starting from his seat, and pacing up and down the room. "s It is useless to waste words upon you, I shall say no more on the subject; but, mark this, whatever may happen, I have warned you, as a true friend should." Saying which, he took up his candle and left the room. It was, perhaps, fortunate that he did so, for the hot blood had mounted to Herbert's forehead at Walter's strong language, whilst a very unpriestly desire to knock him down took posses- sion of him, and it is not improbable that his feelings would, at least, have found vent in corresponding words, had the oppor- tunity been granted him. As it was, although he paced the room half. of the night,   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        I8I striving to master the demon that had been aroused within him, yet he was able to meet Walter with tolerable composure the next morning, and no actual breach was made between them. Walter, on his part, felt that he had been more violent than the occasion warranted, and determined that, having done his duty in putting Herbert on his guard, it would be best to drop the subject at once and forever. A slight rupture had been made, however, in their friendship, and the very fact of -there being a subject on which they were unable to converse amicably, cast a shadow over their hitherto unrestrained intercourse. Walter found his position very irksome, and longed for the completion of the business that had brought him to town. It was with a light heart, therefore, that some two weeks after his arrival he-found himself free to return home; and it was not many hours after, that he took leave of Herbert with a mental resolve not to see him soon again. "We shall be good friends at a distance, old fellow," he said, as he shook his hand; " and I will write to you the same as ever. I am sorry that my advice displeased you, and, although I had determined not to refer again to the subject, I must beg, as a last request, that you will temperately consider it before you make a final resolve to remain here for six months." "I have clearly considered the -matter from every point of view," replied Herbert, bowing stiffly, "and am quite certain that I am acting as duty requires; it is not, therefore, worth while to re-open the discussion.

T is strange," mused Walter, as- he passed into the street, "how people will throw away their lives. Here is a young fellow with the world before him, love, beauty, wealth, within his grasp, and he forms a mighty Moloch out of duty; and places within its burning arms all his hopes and pleasures." "Want to buy a nice little dog, sir?" exclaimed a voice at his side, and a very ragged urchin held up to view a tiny spaniel of the King Charles' breed. "No; I do not want it," replied Walter, hurrying on. "One of us," he continued, in soliloquy, " loses everything in a hot pursuit of ' the world, the flesh, and the devil,' whilst the other- " "Six months old, sir; will never grow any more," contin- ued the boy, following closely at his heels, and still offering the animal.

"' Such a nice present for a lady," reiterated the boy, in a loud voice, as Walter strode away from him; "and only five dollars-" '"Whilst the other loses everything in a hot pursuit of- that is a nice little dog; how pleased Annette would be with it," continued Walter, striving hopelessly to recover his interrupted train of thought.

For a moment Walter paused, and looked at the animal, picturing to himself the look of pleased surprise with which Annette would greet the gift, the half-shy, yet grateful glance which she would bestow upon himself; then, suddenly turning away, he muttered, "What is it to me whether she be pleased or not; let her lover provide her pets," and strode on. "Oh, won't you buy it," cried the boy; "such a nice present for a lady." Walter quickened his pace to escape temptation. "Only-- five - dollars," came after him, as he disappeared in the distance. "These wretched beggarly brats," he exclaimed, with a clouded brow; they ought not to be allowed in the public high- way. What was I thinking of? Oh, yes. Some lose their lives in a hot pursuit--yes, a hot pursuit -she would have liked that little dog, I know; and what possible harm can there be in my giving her pleasure." Again he half turned, just in time to see boy and dog " in hot pursuit" of himself. "She is nothing to me, nor ever can be; but she is Herbert's sweet- heart. It would please him, certainly, to know that I had gra- tified her." He stood still and the boy gained on him. "Is it for Herbert'ts pleasure?" whispered his good angel. "Is it even for Annette's? Is it not rather-that you may make for yourself a place in her heart, and have'a claim upon her gratitude? Have a care, Walter, have a care! Do not betray your friend. Do not blast two innocent lives." "Such a nice present for a lady," repeated the boy, again at his side. "Will you get out, you vagabond!" exclaimed Walter, furiously.

What a miserable world this is," he continued, as he turned his head resolutely towards the coach. "The things that we wish to do are always wrong, and what we may do is never pleasant. Why, the devil, does not Herbert send her a dog. She needs something sadly on which to lavish the love, of which her dear little heart is full. I suppose, however, it would be contrary to the programme, that this calm lover has set before him. By Jove! he is a queer fellow. Think of draw- ing a plan of courtship, as one would of a house! dividing a" given period of time, like the rounds of a ladder, and going up just so many steps each day. Annette! Annette! if I were your lover-but, I am not ; so why should I speculate as to what I would do, under different circumstances." He reached the coach, and threw himself into it, in no en- viable state-of mind. "Confound that blackguard! I wish I had never seen him or his dog; they have put to flight a goodly flock of thoughts. What was it I was thinking of! I wish I had something to take home to Annette, to show her that I did not forget her. I was a fool not to buy the dog. I am becoming as scrupulous as Herbert. Ah, now I recollect the subject of my thoughts- whilst one man loses everything in a hot pursuit after pleasure, another misses his happiness, in a hot pursuit after Heaven. It amounts to the same thing in the end-" "All right!" shouted the post-boy, as he'closed the coach- door with a slam. "Go ahead; " and was it delirium, or did Walter really hear from the coath-window a mournful voice exclaiming: "Only five dollars! such a nice present for a lady." The voice might have been imagination, but the soft, warm substance that was gently placed in his lap was too real for a dream, even if its grimy-faced owner had not been obviously perched upon the door-step.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        I  "Take that, and be--blessed " exclaimed Walter, rolling up a five-dollar note and aiming it at him, as he was dragged from his perch by the guard. "I told you I would buy that dog, if you came after me again ! " and the coach rolled on, leaving the boy clutching the note with a grin of superior cun- ning upon his face, but bearing away with it the little " f-ull- blooded King Charles, sir; only six months old; never grow any larger; such a nice present for a lady;" but never any more to be bought for five dollars. No; neither five, nor five times five, nor fifty-five times five, could have bought that dog from Walter, then. He was satisfied that he had done his best to resist temptation; he had struggled against fate, but fate had proved mightier than he. Who, then, was to blame, but the Creator, who had made him so weak; and by this specious reasoning, he silenced his accusing conscience, and gave him- self up to delightful dreams, not only of Annette's pleasure in the little animal, but,' alas ! of how she would fondle and caress his gift; how it would be forever with her; in all her walks, or rides by day, and by night even, would perhaps lie cradled in her arms la constant reminder of himself. "Is that a dog, sir!"  This exclamation,- made in.a tone of extreme disgust, aroused Walter from his reverie, and on look- ing up, he perceived a maiden of some fifty summers on the seat facing him, regarding the little spaniel he held with no friendly eye. 'It is," said Walter, bowing politely, and repeating me- chanically, "a full-blooded King Charles." "I should think so, the horrid little varmint!" replied the lady, curling her lip and elevating her nose. " Do, somebody, open all the windows ! I thought the coach was very close when I first entered; " and, sinking back upon the cushions, she pro- duced a fan and a bottle of salts, and devoted herself to the  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8179-00000091"/> I86        'ANNETTE; OR, restoration of her exhausted nervous system for the space of five minutes, after which she sat up and returned to the attack. "Pray, sir," said she, " did you buy a ticket for your dog? I was not aware that puppies travelled free by this coach; do they carry any other animals?" "Old tabby-cats," was on Walter's lips; but he prudently restrained his desire to utter the words, and replied instead, that he believed animals were not allowed within the coach as a rule, but that the one in question had been brought to him too late to make any arrangements for its transportation, and as it was too small to incommode any one, he hoped to be allowed to hold it on his knees during the journey. "That you certainly shall not!" she exclaimed hotly. "I never heard of such insufferable impudence! To bring a wretched cur like that into the presence of a sensitive person, like myself. Dogs are particularly offensive to me; I cannot abide them. Full-blooded did you say? then it is the more likely to have fits! I know it has fits! Look at it! it is getting one now! Oh! open the door 1 " she continued, with a shriek of alarm; "open the door, and let me out! Driver! -dear driver! do stop and let me out! mad dog! mad dog!" This last, being screamed out of the window, produced the desired effect, and brought the driver to a full stop; and the lady pre- cipitated herself from the coach, sinking upon the grass in violent hysterics. "Mercy on us!" exclaimed the driver. i' What's the row! How, in the name  of heaven, did a mad dog get into my coach!  Who's got 'him, anyhow? I say, will you fotch out that dog, whoever you are that's got him? D 'ye suppose I carry mad dogs, man?"  Thus adjured, Walter stepped from the coach with a brow as black as night, and produced, for the driver's inspection, the ferocious animal that had produced the commotion.    "Well, now, 'pon my soul! I don't see much amiss with the critter," said he, as he looked curiously at it. "It's uncom- mon pretty, and no mistake; but how came you to take it in the coach with you? don't you know no animals ain't allowed there?"  Walter briefly explained the circumstance, and asked per- mission to continue to hold it, as it was much too small to be fastened outside, in the usual way. "Well, I've no objections," said the driver, "if the lady agrees, but I've no right to turn her out 'cause of your beast. Isayd Miss, take another look at the animial; it ain't no great nuisance! let the gentleman take it inside with him, and I'll promise it won't hurt you." "Oh! take the dreadful monster away!" shrieked the fair spinster, kicking violently upon the turf in a spasm of alarm. "Hang it! drown it! I will never get into the coach again with it! Oh! how fearfully it rolled its eyes, when-it looked at me!" "And small blame to it," muttered the driver, with a -grin. -"I've known older dogs than yon, who would have rolled their eyes clean inside out, to prevent themselves from looking at you; but get in! get in!" he exclaimed, aloud. "I can't stand here no longer. If you won't have the dog, you won't; and there's the end of it. Mister, you'll just have to step up here beside me, if you won't give up the dog." And so it was settled. Walter clambered up the side of the coach, for nothing could induce him to relinquish his charge, and the lady returned to her seat, sighing and moaning that she did not know when her nerves would recover from the' shock they had received. And now Walter's penance began..

Thus it was with Walter, and I fear the little dog was con- signed by him to very warm quarters, at least a dozen times during that ride. His only comfort was that the sun could not last much longer, unless, indeed, Joshua interfered, and com- manded it to stand, still; but, alas! we know not what is best for us. The sun went down, it is true, but a damp mist suc- ceeded it, which finally ended in a cold, drizzly rain; and the August day seemed likely to close in a November night. Being totally unprepared for any change in the weather, Wal- ter suffered acutely, and it was with actual rage that he saw the windows of the coach closed, the curtains drawn, and felt how snug and comfortable was his enemy, who had driven him out to face wind and weather, perched uneasily in his lofty seat. Fortunately, however, misery ends as well as happiness; this wretched journey was at last completed, and Walter found him- self at his own door, as miserable as man well can be, with all his beautiful dreams washed out of him. So    THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       I89 CHAPTER. XXII. WHAT DID HE MEAN. "ZABETH and Annette came into the hall to meet Wal- ter as he entered, but he was much too dreary, to take further notice of them than by an uncivil nod. "Why, Walter, my dear boy," exclaimed Elizabeth, as she laid her hand upon his arm, "you are all wet; did you know it?" "I thought it possible," said Walter, grimly. "How could it have happened," said Elizabeth. "Riding .on the top of a coach in a pelting rain does not tend to keep one dry, that I ever heard of," replied Walter. "But why did you not ride inside?" said Elizabeth, with a look of wonder. "Because I was obliged to hold this confounded dog," ex- claimed Walter, suddenly producing the animal from under his coat, where he had hidden it to protect it from the rain. "A dog!" ejaculated Elizabeth. "Oh, what a beauty!" exclaimed Annette. "There, then, take it," said Walter, placing it in her arms, and entirely forgetting all his visions of its presentation in the actual discomfort of the moment. "I got it for you, and I hope it will prove as remarkable a beast as the'late lamented Pudge. Elizabeth," he continued, as he walked off towards his room, " could you have a little fire built in the library? I am shivering with cold." "To be sure," replied, Elizabeth. "Come down directly you have changed your clothes, and you will find it burning brightly."  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC8179-00000093"/> Igo        ANNETTE; OR, "'He has taken a severe cold, I fear," said Elizabeth to An- nette, as they entered the room together. "And it was all on my account, " said Annette, turning a con- science-stricken face to her companion. "It is not your fault," said Elizabeth, patting her soft, round cheek, "as you knew nothing at all about it, child. I do not think you need reproach yourself. Run and call .Betsy to bring some wood, and, when the fire is lighted, we will warm his slippers, make him a hot drink, and thoroughly ' toast' his cold away." Annette needed no second bidding, and in a very short time the fire was burning on the hearth, the kettle singing upon the hob, the slippers standing upright against the fender, as if inviting some one to put them on, and last, though not least, Annette, kneeling upon the hearth-rug, keeping a watchful eye over everything, whilst she stroked the water from the little dog's long hair, and dried him in the blaze. This was the home-scene upon which Walter entered, and, as he drew near, he felt a thrill of pleasure to which he had long been a stranger. Annette, perceiving his approach, sprang to her feet, and, carefully laying the little dog upon the rug, pushed an easy- chair up to the hearth for him, handed him the warm slippers and attended generally to his comfort. "Have you everything you want?" asked she, as she paused in her active labors. "  Yes, thank you, everything," said Walter, in a voice so musical that Annette could scarcely recognize her usually ban- tering antagonist in its tones. "If you will come and sit by me, now, and tell me all that has happened since I  went away, I shall be perfectly happy," he continued.   OTHE CHRONICLES' OF BELLEVUE.      I9I Annette' picked up the little dog, and blushingly took the low seat he had indicated; but, although she had thought of a thousand things she should tell him, whilst he was away, now that he was here, she could remember nothing, and sat beside him, gazing into the fire, and listening to the beating of her heart. Oh, why would it beat so fast and loud! She was sure that Walter must hear it. 'And why would he keep his eyes fixed upon her. She should never be able to speak whilst he looked at her so intently. What had become of her wits, that she could think of nothing to say. Walter waited patiently some moments for her to speak, feast- ing his eyes, meanwhile, upon the fair face before him, with its blushing cheeks and downcast eyes, then breaking the silence, he said: "Well, must I speak first? Tell me, then, what you have been doing since I left you, and whether meanwhile you missed me." "Of course we have missed you," replied Annette. "How could we help it, with no one to fill your place? And as for what I have been doing, you know that without being told, for I have simply followed the same daily routine as when you were here. '  "You have learned no new accomplishments?" asked Wal- ter, with a meaning smile. "No! -yes!" exclaimed Annette, suddenly perceiving what he meant. "Thanks to you, I drive beautifully. George says there is no longer any necessity that he should go out with me. How very kind it was of you to provide amusement for me, during your absebnce." "On the contrary it was very selfish of me," said Walter. "I did it to ensure. being remembered by you." s  l.                ,  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8179-00000094"/> 192        ANNETTE; OR, o i' I do not believe that," said Annette, with a bright smile. 'C You are too conceited to suppose for a moment that we could forget you. You did it out of pure, disinterested generosity. Why is it that youi always put the worst construction upon all your actions? You do yourself great injustice." "I should like to become acquainted with myself, through you," replied Walter. "I have always had a hazy notion that I was a very superior fellow, but as no one else seems to recog- nize the fact, I conclude that I am mistaken." "I will introduce you to yourself," replied Annette. , "To begin with, you do yourself a great deal of harm by saying outrageous things, which you do not really believe, for the pur- pose of creating remark, or exciting some one's indignation. Is it not so?" "Certainly, if you say so," replied Walter. "And your heart is full of unselfish consideration for others, but you hide it all under a mask of raillery, and appear to be most ill-natured when you are actually kindest." ' Pray continue," said Walter. "I am lost in admiration of myself. Tell me some other of my noble' traits of character."  "There!" exclaimed Annette.  "Now you are turning yourself inato ridicule; you must laugh at some one. Are you ever serious?" "Am I ever serious?" repeated Walter, slowly. "Aye-! and sad enough too sometimes, to satisfy my worst enemy, or- what shall I call you?-my best friend." "But I do not wish you to be sad," said Annette. "I only wish you to do yourself justice, and not to laugh at virtues that you really respect, and secretly cultivate." "Bless my soul!" exclaimed :Walter, laughing heartily. "Is that a fact? Do I really cultivate virtue? It must be done very secretly, indeed; for I did not even know it myself; how then did you discover it?"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        1993 "I first learned it through your goodness to me," replied Annette, in a voice full of suppressed feeling. "Did you not open your hospitable door to me, a friendless orphan, and does not that prove generosity? and, not satisfied with that, did you not seek my society, when your sister had lost all patience, and try to wean me from my sadness? does not that prove up- selfishness? and all the while you teased and laughed at me, so that I almost hated you; never dreaming of the kind motive hid beneath your banter until you had gone away, and Sir Rodger made his appearance at the door, a mute witness of your forethought and consideration for me. Then I learned to understand you better, and to know you as you really are." "I am really a very charming fellow," said Walter. "I suppose I must not question the motive power of these actions? I may not suggest the possibility of my 'generosity,' magna- nimity, superabundant ' unselfishness,' returning seven-fold unto myself, in the pleasure it gives me to make you happy? No, I see this would not be in keeping with my newly found character, for it would not be creditable to do good that I might be happy. " "You are incorrigible!" exclaimed Annette, laughing. "  will not talk to you about yourself again. You cannot change my opinion of you, therefore you may as well not try; it will be time wasted." "Let us change the subject then," said Walter. "How do you like your dog?" "Oh, so much," replied Annette. "It is a little beauty; what is its name?" "I did not think of asking," replied Walter. "You will have to give it one yourself. What shall it be? Ponto, Toby, Jack?"  'What a' Goth' you are to suggest such names for a precious -\   &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC8179-00000095"/> i 194        ANNETTE; OR, little darling, like this!" exclaimed Annette. "Look at him, sir! does that patrician nose suggest a 'Toby' or a ' Jack? '" "I crave his pardon," said Walter. "Call him ' Liebchen,' 'Bijou,' 'Fiddle,'-" "Fidele?" exclaimed Annette. "I like that; it means faithful, does it not?" "Yes," replied Walter, "but I prefer Liebchen." "I do not know what that means," said Annette. "I do not understand German." "No?" replied Walter. "Well, then you call 'the dog Fidele, and I will call you Liebchen. How will that answer?" "Very well," replied Annette. "They are both pretty names, don't you think so?" "Yes, Liebchen," replied Walter, and something in the tone of his voice caused Annette to look up. He was reclining in the large chair, with his head resting upon the cushion, and, perhaps it was owing to the dark-blue velvet covering, that his face looked so deadly white, while his eyes seemed to shine with an unnatural lustre. "What is the matter?" ejaculated Annette. "Do you feel ill?" "Not very well," he replied, in a stifled voice. "I have a violent spasm in my left side; I fear that I have taken a severe cold." "I am so sorry," said Annette. "And it was on Fiddle's account that you rode outside the coach in the rain. Fidele, don't you feel remorse at the trouble you have caused?" "It was not altogether on his account," replied Walter; "I fear Fidele's Mistress has the most to answer for." "Then let her make amends now," said Annette, "by get- ting something that may relieve your suffering: The kettle is boiling, and your sister has set out an alarming array of bottles and glasses. What can I do for you?"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       I95 "Give me anything that is hot," replied Walter, with chat- tering teeth. "I cannot get warm." Annette at once prepared a hot drink, which he hastily swal- lowed, feeling really quite ill; and Elizabeth, entering soon after, announced that tea was ready. - He expressed an unwill- ingness to move from his comfortable seat however, and begged that they would leave him where he was, whilst they eat their supper. They went in accordingly, by themselves, and the meal was hastily dispatched ; Elizabeth having some "society " matters to attend to, and Annette being anxious about Walter. "May I take him a cup of tea?" asked Annette, as she rose from the table, but Elizabeth, whose thoughts were a hundred miles away, gazed vacantly at her, evidently not comprehend- ing the question, and on its repetition, asked, hesitatingly: "Who? the dog?" "No," replied Annette, laughing, "Mr. Westhrooke." "Oh," said Elizabeth, slightly confused at her own forget- fulness. "You may, if you please; but I do not think he wants it."  Annette took up the cup and saucer, and proceeded to the library, where she found' Walter just where she had left him, but looking much better. His extreme pallor had passed away, and he said that he had succeeded in getting warm at last. She placed the cup of tea on the table, and stood for a few moments at his side. "I am glad that you are better," she said, "I was very much ; afraid that you were going to be ill."          : :: "I thought so myself," replied Walter, "and I do not feel : all right yet."  "Oh, please don't say that," said Annette.

"I can do that, easily," replied Annette. "'I am a capital nurse; even when I was very small, I can remember putting my hands on my father's head, when he was suffering, to ' drive away the pain,' and he always told me that I had a special talent for nursing." "I wish you could charm away my headache," said Walter, with a sigh, but I fear it is beyond the art of either physician or nurse. iebchen, my brain is on fire." "Had you not better go to bed?" said Annette, regarding him attentively. "I could not sleep if I did," replied Walter. "It is better to sit here with company, than lie tossing alone for hours on my bed. Sit down again, in your old seat, and talk to me, or rather let me talk to you, for a hundred brilliant thoughts are running riot in my brain. Let us collect them, put them in order, and write a book that will make our fortunes; we must begin-- once upon a   time,' must we not?

I doubt if there zweere more than two men, then, but-there was a woman! yes, there was a woman!" "I think you had better be quiet," said Annette, anxiously. "You are exciting, yourself more than is right, considering your violent headache.'" "Oh, no, I  am not," said Walter. "It does me good to talk; it disposes of the thoughts that are crowding my brain, jostling each other, so as to cause excruciating pain. What   THE CHRONICLES OF- BELLEVUE.       197 did you interrupt me for?" he continued, pettishy; "I have not the least idea now, what I was going to say." "You said there were twd men," replied Annette, "you were going to tell me a story.' "Ah, so I was," said Walter, looking dreamily into the fkre; then after a pause, -' well, there were two men, friends, brothers, comrades, what you will! but they loved each other dearly, and, what is more to the purpose, trusted each other, also. "One day the younger man determined to go ona: journey, and coming to his friend, he said: "'Behold, I must leave you for a time, and before I go, I have one request to make of you; in my hand I bring my only earthly possession, and to you, my best friend, I give it, to hold in honorable keeping for me, against my return.' As he spoke he placed in his friend's hand a case, containing a jewel, worth to him the whole wealth of the Indies.- The elder man accepted the trust, without either opening the case, or questioning him as to its contents, and his friend went on his way rejoicing. He was a fool, was he not, to believe that an honest man lived? Pshaw! my story is very stupid, is it not?" He looked inquiringly at Annette, who was by this time ex- ceedingly alarmed, by his strange looks and incoherent words, and she answered, hesitatingly:     .        ^ "I think you are too unwell to remember it correctly.'-' "By heaven, no!" he exclaimed, in great excitement. "I know it by heart! I have repeated it to myself night and day for a hundred years, at least! but you interrupt me so, that I . : cannot keep the thread of it; just keep quiet a moment, and I  shall be able -o repeat it like a parrot.        ' "He accepted the trust, and some time after his friend's de- parture, the devil tempted him to open it. He did so, and as ; r he beheld the contents he coveted the jewel, and hated his i   &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC8179-00000097"/> 198        ANNETTE; OR, friend, because he was the rightful owner. Now, it could be of no use to this man, even should he steal it; for of money he had no lack, and he was bound, by a solemn vow, never to wear a gem of this description; yet, Liebchen, the discontented fellow gazed at it, longed for it; coveted it to such an-extent, that his life threatened to become a burden to him if he might not own it. But one escape could he see from this terrible temptation, and that was to give up the jewel to its rightful owner." Hitherto, Walter, although evidently excited, had been lean- ing back -quietly in his chair, but now he started upright, and fixing his delirious gazi upon Annette, exclaimed: "Liebchen! I tell you but the truth when I say that this man tried to do well! He went to his friend! he pleaded with him! he exhorted him! he prayed him to take back his jewel, to free him from his dangerous trust!- but his friend refused to listen to him! laughed him to scorn, and sent him home again, still guardian of his treasure! "He turned his steps towards home, and all the way he battled with himself; but a dull presentiment of evil hung over him, and he felt that it-was worse than useless to strive against fate. He entered in at his own door, he held the casket in his hand! Just wait a moment, until I think what it was he then did!" "Oh, pray, be quiet," exclaimed Annette, almost sobbing. ".I do not want to hear the rest of the-story. You look and talk so wildly." "And is it any wonder?" said Walter, " any wonder that my poor weak brain cannot stand the thought of that which rent the earth from top to bottom, like a gauze veil?" "'Good heavens!" murmured Annette, "he is out of his head. Oh, why does Miss Mordaunt not come." "You do not wish to hear the rest, you say, but you must."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        199 Walter went on hurriedly: "It is your fate to listen, as it was his to do the wrong. He took the casket in his hand, he opened it, to. take one last long look at his heart's desire, and then to put it from him at once and forever; but as the upraised lid revealed it to his gaze, a legion of, incarnate fiends seized upon his soul, tempting him to deadly sin. Will you tell me that he did not struggle? Before God, I swear that he did; but it was of no use, of no use! The devil stood at his right hand, whispering in his ear, and he seized the jewel from its casket, and took it for his own. But he could not wear it. Lieb- chen, no; the day for that was passed, and when he awoke to know that it was so, he went mad. Do you hear?" he shrieked, "he went mad! He threw it upon the ground; he trampled it under foot; he spoiled it, destroyed its beauty forever. Aye, such destruction was never wrought before. The world looked, on in silence; the demons laughed in fiendish glee; but the angels-- Liebchen-- the angels wept at the ruin of what was once as pure and spotless as themselves! And the man - the murderer of innocence, what of him? He stood and gazed upon the destruction his hands had wrought - upon the jewel crushed and broken at his feet - the once fairest thing on earth to him, lying, soiled and ruined in the dust! He saw the crowd gaping on him, as they cried: ' Down with the betrayer!' My God!- what was there left for him to do, but sheathe a dagger in his breast; drive it home to his very heart, in defiance of heaven and hell; for he was mad! mad!" shrieked Walter, springing from his seat in wild delirium. Annette started up also, to call for assistance; but, before she had gone many steps, Walter's fictitious strength, born of the fever that was burning within, deserted him, and he fell pros- trate on the ground, at her feet. A-cry of terror escaped her lips, as she threw herself beside him on the floor, and endeavored l'  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC8179-00000098"/> 200        ANNETTE; OR    . to restore him to consciousness, and, at the sound, Elizabeth hastily entered the room to learn what was the matter.  "He is dead! he is dead!" wailed Annette, as she stooped over his senseless form, "and I am the cause of his death!" "Don't be a fool!" ejaculated Elizabeth, shaking her roughly by the shoulder; "stop whining, and call George to put him to bed!" CHAPTER XXIII. WALTER S . ILLNESS. NO sleep visited the inmates of Bellevue that night. The physician, who had been hastily summoned, pronounced Walter to be suffering from the combined effects of the sun and the rain, resulting in brain-fever. He was certainly very'ill, and Elizabeth never left him for a moment. All her old devotion towards the little, motherless orphan, seemed to have returned now that he was once more dependant upon her. Annette, excluded from the sick man's chamber, wandered restlessly through the deserted rooms below, with the noiseless read and ashen face of some poor ghost; until, nature suc- :umbing under this unwonted vigil, she fell asleep a little after laybreak upon the sofa in the parlor. It was almost mid-day when she awoke, and for a few moments he could not recall what had happened, so heavily had she lept. At the sight of Fidele, however, sleeping at her feet, ecollection returned to her, and, with a sad and anxious heart, ie made her way up-stairs to inquire regarding Walter.  "There is no change," said Elizabeth, who had come to the   door for a moment.' "He is very, very ill; "--whilst the deep ;  lines beneath her eyes, and the white-set expression of her face, :  betokened how she had passed the night.:X "May I not come in now?" pleaded Annette. "Oh, do   ::X let me help you to nurse him. Let me take your place whilst - you take some rest."                      ' No!" said Elizabeth, shaking her head; "not now, my   - dear, not now. No one but myself must be with him whilst he - raves so frightfully."   Even as she spoke, they could hear Walter talking rapidly to  himself, in a confused jargon, unintelligible from the door; : then suddenly raising himself upon his elbow, he exclaimed :!

Wher- ever she went they followed her--in-doors and out, up-stairs and down; and so earnestly did she strive to pray, that it seemed. almost, sometimes, as though her heart itself had melt- ed into prayer, and gone wailing to the gates of heaven. Two, three days passed, and Dr. Webster's brow became more clouded after every visit to the sick man. Annette needed -not to ask him his opinion of the case, for it was stamped too plainly on his sombre face. "Oh, he must not die!" exclaimed Annette, on the- third day of Walter's illness, as she watched the doctor's retreating form. "He is young, temperate, strong; surely he cannot die. I do not believe Dr. Webster understands the case. There should be a consultation. If Miss Mordaunt would but send for Dr. Wallis." This idea took such hold upon her mind that she at last de- termined to brave Elizabeth's anger, and penetrate into the sick-room, for the purpose of suggesting it. No sound proceeded thence, as she went up stairs, and the door stood wide open before her. What did the strange silence mean. She paused, trembling upon the threshold. The white outline of a figure, stretched upon the bed, filled her with alarm, and the next object that met her view, Elizabeth, at the foot of the bed, her head bowed within her hands, confirmed her appre- hensions. "Oh, what has happened?"  she gasped out, laying her hand on Elizabeth's arm.  "Is he-is he--worse?"  Elizabeth raised her face, worn and white with watching; her eyes looked dull and glassy; the furrows on her cheek had deepened; even her hair looked grayer. "Annette," she said, slowly, {"the doctor says that we must not expect to see him better in this world. 'He is sinking rapidly; there is no hope."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        203    - "I do not believe it!" exclaimed Annette, passionately; "The doctor does not know! He cannot die! Only three   ' : days sick I! so young and strong!

Let me stay here until you send a special messenger for him."                 - Elizabeth looked irresolutely at her for a moment, and rising to her feet, said: "It can do no harm, at any rate. Stay here, then, until I return, and call me instantly if any change takes place ; " say-  ing which, she noiselessly left the room. Annette went softly to the bed, and took her post of obser- - vation where she could best watch every variation of the sleeper's face. It was the first time since he was taken ill that she had seen him, and she was totally unprepared for the ravages that sickness had made in him. The pillow was scarcely whiter than the face which rested on it, and his features stood out as sharply defined as those of a marble statue. His eyes were deeply sun- ken in his head, and the heavy, black hair lay in an uncurled mass upon his-forehead, damp with its moisture; the hand, rest- ing upon the coverlet, was whiter than her own; and, but for a slight quivering of the fingers now and then, so faint was his breathing, she would have thought him already dead. Approaching nearer, she stooped to wipe the moisture from  : his brow, and with tender hands to stroke back the hair from off it, when, suddenly, the large eyes opened and fixed them- selves upon her, but without a sign of recognition in them. * Mastering the passionate grief that assailed her, she stooped ; lower still, and moistened his parched lips with the cordial left :  beside him for that purpose, and then with a sinking heart a resumed her seat, to watch and pray. / " O God, have mercy! .,..:, O  God, have mercy!" the only words that came readily to i? * :R  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC8179-00000100"/> 204  -      ANNETTE; OR, her lips in her anguish. The eyes, which had remained fixed upon her now closed, and then slowly opened again, but this time recognition shone in them. Yes; he was conscious, and as she again bent over him, the faint reflection of a smile passed over his face, as his pallid lips murmured : "Liebchen! - my Liebchen - in heaven.'  But as quickly as it had come this gleam of intelligence passed away. Once more he seemed to sleep, and Annette resumed her seat, to watch and hope and pray again until Eliza- beth's return. On the following day Dr. Wallis appeared, and was ushered in due form into the library, to consult with his colleague, and after about a half-an-hour's conversation, they went up together to the patient's room, whilst Elizabeth and Annette kept each other company in the hall outside, being too anxious to go farther away.- Elizabeth's powers of endurance were wellnigh at an end. As she leaned against the wall for support, her frame was shaken with powerful sobs, terrible to hear from one so unused to any outward show of emotion. Encircling her in her arms, Annette drew her into her room, which stood directly opposite them, and seating her upon a chair, kneeled down at her side, and pillowed her head upon her shoulder. "Do not grieve so," she said, in tender accents, pressing tier lips to her forehead. "There is hope, yet; I know there is hope. Bear up a little while longer, until we shall learn the truth.,' "The truth!" echoed Elizabeth, in a mournful voice, "and what if the truth crush our last hope! Oh! what is there left to live for, if my boy is taken from me? The boy that I have loved and watched and tended all my life, until he seems to be my own."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        205    i "Whatever isj is best" said Annette, through her fast flow- ing tears. "God will not take him, if it be not time for him to go." "Time for him to go!" cried Elizabeth, " time for him, in his strong manhood, to go; whilst I, a lone old woman, stand cumbering the ground! No! it is not time for him to go, with the world spread out before him, and his life not more than half-begun." "We cannot tell what is before him," replied Annette, "but the good God can; and it may be that He sees fit to take him now, to save him future misery. Oh! think of this, I pray you!" 1 "I can think of nothing but my boy's peril!" exclaimed Elizabeth. "Oh! Annette, you are innocent and pure! raise your voice in supplication for him! Perchance the great Judge may listen to you! pray Annette! pray, as you have never prayed before! pray for my boy's life!" ( Liebchen! pray for me!" again the words seemed wafted to her, and with clasped hands and streaming eyes, she pleaded with Heaven for Walter Westhrooke's life. 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC8179-00000101"/> 206!        ANN!ETTE; OR, CHAPTER XXIV. CONVALESCENCE. T  HE consultation was over; and the doctors emerged from the sick-chamber, leaving Elizabeth, who had been sum-  moned some moments before, to resume her post as nurse. Annette scanned their faces as they passed down the stairs, but to no purpose; for, for once even, Dr. Webster's usually communicative countenance told no tales.   , They paused at the front door, and Annette leaned anxiously! over the banister, to catch the thread of their conversation. "Shall you return this evening?" inquired Dr. Webster. "Cannot tell yet," replied Dr. Wallis. "It depends upon! how he is," he added, indicating Walter's room by a motion: of his head. "What time does the next coach pass?" "About six o'clock this evening," replied Dr. Webster. "Ah, well, it will be all over by that time," replied Dr. Wallis. Annette's heart seemed to stand still. "It will be all over by that time!" by six o'clock that evening Walter would have passed away forever! Dr. Webster had gone out to look for his carriage, and An- nette, gliding swiftly down the stairs,' suddenly confronted her old friend, as he stood at the hall-door, awaiting his colleague's return. "Why, dear me! How d 'ye do!" exclaimed the doctor, with a cheerful smile, extending his hand to her; but Annette could not wait to be civil. "Doctor!" she exclaimed. "Oh! doctor, must he die?"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        207 "Who? the young man up stairs?" replied the doctor. '-Bless your heart, no; why should he die?"       i "I thought," faltered Annette, "that I heard you say that it would soon be all over with him." "The danger, my dear, the danger will soon be all over,' said the doctor. "His disease reached a crisis this morning,  and he has taken a decided turn for the better, so that I hope by this evening to be able to pronounce him entirely out of danger, and in need of nothing but careful nursing." "God bless you!" exclaimed Annette, bursting into tears, at this sudden relief to her overcharged feelings. "With all my heart, my dear," said the doctor, with an odd twinkle in his eye, " but I do not exactly comprehend what I am to be blessed for." Annette waited for no further colloquy, but bounded up stairs again to congratulate Elizabeth. "I shall always think your prayers saved his life," whispered Elizabeth, as -she kissed her fondly. "You have acted like a sister towards him ; I can never forget it; neither will he when I tell him how devoted you have been, and, my child, you will- be repaid some day, I know." Walter passed a good night, and the next day was perfectly conscious, although too feeble to speak. Annette capered about in a state of ecstasy, too much excited to keep still for a moment. "Fidele!" she exclaimed, catching up the little dog, "-he is better, do you hear? he is out of danger-is going to get well! You stupid thing! why don't you bark and say you are glad!" Then racing down the walk, she surprised poor Sir Rodger, who was calmly grazing in the field, by throwing her arms around his neck, and shouting'  -         .; "Rodger!

He will be well soon, Rodger, and then--Oh, the rides and the drives and the walks that we will take together; he, and you, and I." "Annette! come here, you crazy child!" called Elizabeth, looking smilingly down at her from an upper window. "I want you to take my place, for a time, whilst I make something to tempt our invalid's appetite." Nothing loath, Annette sprang up stairs two steps at a time, and entered Walter's room the incarnation of youth and beauty; with joyous smiles rippling all over her face, lurking in her eyes, and wreathing her lips. "You must not let him say a word," enjoined Elizabeth, "now, remember, not a word." "Not a syllable," replied Annette, " under the penalty of excommunication," as she took her seat on an ottoman near the bed, where she could see Walter. The sick man gazed at her earnestly; she was like a bright flower transplanted to an arid soil; a breath of cool air to a fevered brow. And there she sat, motionless and speechless, like a very good child acting " patience," with her big blue eyes fixed upon him, as if she were afraid he was going to vanish. He smiled at her once or twice, but was too weak to care to speak, and thus they remained until Elizabeth returned. From this time Walter improved rapidly. Each day Annette was allowed to visit him for a little while, always bringing with her some little offering from the outer world to cheer the inva- lid, and, as she said, to induce him to get well quicker; and as his convalescence became more pronounced, books were intro- duced, provided they were very stupid, to prevent any possi- bility of excitement. At last, one bright day in September, he came down stairs,   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        209 and sat among them once more in the library; but now came the hardest time of all, in his nurses' experience, for Walter's spirit far outdid his strength, and constantly caused him a relapse into weakness. "How can I keep you quiet?"Annette exclaimed one day. "' I never saw such a restless creature. If there was only some light literature in the house, I would read to you; but all the books are so dull and tiresome." "There are Goethe's works," said Walter, " and no end of German poetry ; but you do not understand German, do you?" "-Cannot I learn?" inquired Annette. "I will be a very good girl, if you will teach me. It will give you occupation, whilst my blunders will afford you amusement." "That is a capital idea," replied Walter. "Get the books from that upper shelf, and we will begin at once." The books were produced, and Walter was soon absorbed in the novel occupation of teaching. .Aanette good-naturedly sub- mitted to the tasks imposed upon her, and studied her verbs with a conscientiousness truly remarkable ins one of her years, who had not to earn her daily bread by the same. She was too much pleased at the success of her suggestion to mind the trouble it had entailed upon her, and was more than repaid by the steady improvement in Walter's health, dating from their first lesson.    I The irksomeness of his invalid condition was considerably ameliorated by this source of interest, and it seemed unfailing; for even when Annette was not actually studying with him, he employed himself in a research after complex sentences, and jaw-breaking words, with which to puzzle her when she resumed her tasks. After a time, Walter began to go'about again, and Annette was relieved of her absolute attendance upon him, although his i8*          O  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC8179-00000103"/> 210         ANNETTE; OR, absences by himself were always very short, and he generally contrived, whether riding, driving, or walking, that she should not be very far from his side. Time passed on golden wings for her, absorbed as she was in a happy present, without a glance at the past, or a thought of the future. She never troubled herself as to whither she was drifting; neither did she perplex herself, as on a former occa- sion, with vague conjectures as to her feelings towards Walter, or his towards her. It was sufficient that she felt he liked to have her with him, whilst she knew that his companionship gave her pleasure. Elizabeth was the only dissatisfied one; but she felt that Annette deserved some reward for her devotion during Walter's illness, and set herself to think what she could do for her. "Walter," she said one day, as he stood idly at the hall- door, awaiting Annette's appearance in her riding-habit, "I wish you would invite Mr. Wellesley to pay us a visit. It is a long time since we have seen him." "I do not see what we want him for," replied Walter. "W' may not want him, my dear," replied Elizabeth; "but we must really consider Annette a little." "What does she want with him?" said Walter. "She has not told me that she wishes him for anything," re- plied Elizabeth; " but I was under the impression that you agreed with me in supposing that an attachment existed between them, and if such is the case, the least we can do in return for all she has done for you, is to throw them together, that they may come to an understanding with each other." "I see no possible occasion for it," replied Walter, sharply. "If she loves him, shes will probably continue to do so until he speaks his mind; and if he does not love her, we surely do not wish to thrust her upon him. You had better leave matters as they are. She seems very comfortable and happy."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        2" :'She is very self-sacrificing," replied Elizabeth, "and grudges nothing that she can do to secure your comfort, which renders it all the more necessary for us to consider her interests. I have no doubt that you will miss her sadly, should she marry; but, my dear boy, you surely would not sacrifice her to your selfish wishes, and keep her here to run about after you for the rest of her life." The red blood mounted to Walter's forehead. ,' Confound it all!" he exclaimed angrily. "What do you bother me so for? Find-her as many husbands as you choose; it is no concern of mine; but, for heaven's sake, leave me in peace; " and he turned on his heel and walked rapidly off towards the stables. Annette came down soon after, and there being no appear- ance of either Walter or the horses, she sauntered into the library, and took up one of the German books lying upon the table. The first word that struck her eye was.." Liebchen," and, instinctively, she put out her hand for the dictionary to ascer- tain its meaning. This pet name was one of the few things that Walter had recalled during that chaotic evening when he was taken ill, and he had always passed the word lightly over with- out explanation when they had accidentally stumbled on it in their reading. She would know it now, let it cost what it, might, and with trembling hand she turned the leaves to the letter L. Up one page and down another her finger travelled with great speed, lest Walter should return before she had found the coveted explanation, "L-i-e-b-chen!" there it was; the finger travelled in a hori- zontal line, and the eager eyes read--" darling!"

A shadow fell upon the book, and starting, guiltily, she per- ceived Walter looking over her shoulder, with his eyes fixed upon the fatal word. They stood in silence for a moment, listening to the beating of their hearts, and then Walter, rallying himself with an effort, exclaimed, with a forced laugh: "Eve! Eve! could you not spare that single apple? Ah, well, now you have the knowledge of good or evil--which is it?" Annette could not sufficiently recover her composure to an- swer at once, but stood silent, and with downcast eyes, played nervously with her riding-whip. "You must not be angry," continued Walter. "It was only a joke, you know; I first suggested the name for the dog." "Of course it was a joke," said Annette, recovering herself quickly. "I wonder you thought it necessary to explain. Are not the horses waiting?" "Yes, shall we go out?" replied Walter, and they walked out side by side, each feeling the "joke " to be very pointless. Walter assisted Annette to mount, and they rode along silently for some distance, indulging in reflections the reverse of agreeable. "Fool! fool!" was the burden of Walter's thoughts. "I have rushed on my fate, as usual; now, if she cares anything for me, I am ruined forever!" "It was only a joke," repeated Annette to herself, "it was only a joke; he cares nothing for me, and why should I care? I do not want to be his 'darling,' " nevertheless, there' was a   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        213 choking sensation in her' throat, at the recollection that the . name had been given first to the dog. Alas! although she endeavored to persuade herself that her discovery had not affected her, she knew in her heart' that she had, indeed, eaten of the tree of knowledge since the morning, and must be banished, should her sin become known, from her Paradise forever. "How cheerful we both are, this morning," said Walter, at last breaking the prolonged silence. "I 'wonder what Adam and Eve did under the circumstances!" "I do not see wherein ourposition resembles Adam and Eve's," said Annette. "I did not tempt you to eat, neither  :' had I any notion that you were going to do so, until you stole up behind me, and wrested the fruit from my hand."  "Aye," replied Walter, "I think I am a trifle better than our progenitor in that respect; whatever I do, I do not try to shift the blame upon another. He was a cowardly wretch, was he not?" "Cowardly or not, there are many of his descendants very much like him," replied Annette. "Shirking just censure is a ' family trait' in the human race."  "Do you think that I would do it?" asked Walter. "You might not exculpate yourself at another's expense," replied Annette, " but you would 'cast all the blame on ' fate;' and say you were ' made so' and ' could not,' therefore, 'help it.' " "That is very likely," replied Walter, with a smile. "You have drawn my character very accurately; but what has -become of all my grand and noble characteristics? Was it a part of my ravings, or did you not prove me to be a very fine fellow, just before I was taken ill?"  ' "It was a delirious fancy," said Annette, calmly. "I do  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC8179-00000105"/> 214        ANNETTE; OR,. not think you really comprehended anything clearly from the time you first entered the room that evening." "Then I wish I could rave again,' said Walter, "for it was , very pleasant to feel that some one thought well of me; that no matter how I might be misunderstood and calumniated by 'the world, there was one woman who would believe in me through it all." "You may feel that still, without raving," said Annette, in a low voice. "Ishall never believe any ill of you."' "Do you say so?" said Walter, bringing his horse closer to her side. "Do you promise that no one shall ever make you think ill of me? Ah! Liebchen, will you always have faith in me?" "As the joke is old," said Annette, coloring, " suppose you find some other name for me." "I beg ten thousand pardons," said Walter; "the word came so naturally to my lips, and it seems to suit you so well. You were born to be somebody's darling." "Then it is to be hoped that ' somebody' will find me before I die an old maid," said Annette, with a forced laugh. "There is not muqqh doubt but he will," replied Walter. "He will come here ahnd woo you before my eyes, and you will blush and whisper ' Yes' to his entreaties, and then you -both will ride. away, and H- and H" "Will have recourse to philosophy," said Annette, finishing his remark, " and find some one else to fill my place." "Do you really think me so fickle?" asked Walter. "I only repeat your own words to you," replied Annette; "did you not once tell me that this was philosophy?" "I do not know what blasphemy I may have uttered in the early days of our acquaintance," replied Walter; "but this I say now, that when you leave me--as you will, you know-   THE CHROiNICLLS UOF B lLLEVU,.       l15   - you will make a void in my life that no other woman can ever fill." "Do not distress yourself about so distant a peril to your happiness," said Annette, gaily-his last words having entirely dispersed the cloud upon her spirits. "I assure you no one has yet pleased me enough to cause me to wish to leave my happy home here, to follow him. You will not so easily rid yourself of me. I fear that I am a fixture upon the premises." "If I could only believe that," exclaimed Walter, "I should be relieved of a weight of anxiety; but what of Mr. Wellesley?" "You are so absurd," exclaimed Annette. "Why will you persist in believing that there is some mysterious understanding between him and myself? He would be very much surprised    :: did he -know what you think." "And you do not care anything about him?" inquired Wal- ter, eagerly. "Rodger, go on, sir," said Annette, touching her horse with the whip; " let us leave this impertinent man to ride by him- self. The idea of asking such a question!

HERBERT S .RETURN. THE German lessons proceeded- and everything went on in its accustomed way for some little time after this, not- withstanding the embarrassment they had felt on that morning in the library. "Liebchen" had been tacitly abolished from their dic- tionary, and they both tried to forget that it had ever been in use. Walter felt that every day passed in Annette's society made her dearer to him, but he satisfied himself that he was acting honorably as long as he spoke no word of love to her; not taking into account the lingering pressure of her hand, and the eloquent language of his eyes, which must have revealed his heart to any intelligent observer, and which set Annette's pulses throbbing at least twenty times a day. Still Annette gave herself no time to think, forcing the sub- ject from her mind whenever it entered it, striving to be out- wardly 'always the same, and to pay no attention to Walter's "aberrations," as she termed them. One evening, as they sat together in the gloaming, a danger- ous hour for lovers, watching the blaze of the hickory logs upon the hearth, Walter said, dreamily, as in a sort of soliloquy: "Must a man do penance forever for a fault committed in early youth?. Does the Almighty send us into the world to be marred at the outset of our lives, and drag on the rest of our three-score years and ten in unutterable misery?" '"What could have suggested anything so- horrible to your   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        217 mind?" exclaimed Annette. "It is an utterly incons1int belief. How could a loving Father create pan to make hit suffer?"  "I speak from personal experience," replied Walter. ' When: I was not much more than a boy, I committed an error - not worse--perhaps not so bad as the errors of the men around me; but I was a dupe, and the world forgives anything but stu- pidity. So I was severely censured on all sides, laughed at and deserted by my so-called friends, and reviled and calumniated by my enemies. Looking back to that time, I think I was more sinned against than sinning "-- "I am sure of it," interrupted Annette, turning her trustful eyes full upon him. "And," continued Walter, "it was owing to the better part of -me rather than the worse that I erred; nevertheless, that one error has -blasted my life, made me an outcast from my coun- try, and forever closed to me the gates of happiness! Is it just, I say," he'continued, passionately, " that I should be doomed to wear these chains perpetually, with no hope of freedom until long years haveast, and my transgression be forgotten? Doomed to live apart, like a second Cain, with a mark upon my forehead; cut off forever from what the commonest laborer  may have -a home, blessed by a loving wife." "You take too gloomy a view of your life," said Annette. "Your chains, I imagine, are of your own forging; for God never doomed any man, since Cain, to be a vagabond upon the face of the earth; neither does he refuse to accept repentance. : Whatever your sin, these many years of penance have atoned for it, I am sure, and you might, if you would, be as happy as your fellows.

"If she loved you," faltered Annette, "she would say, ' Give to me your present and your future, and let the dead-past bury its dead!'" ' And you, Annette, if you loved, you would speak thus?" asked Walter, eagerly. "Where I loved I must also trust," replied Annette, "and when I trust, it is without reservation." "I believe it," said Walter, sinking back into his chair. ', Happy the man, Annette, who claims such love, and accursed be he who could betray such trust." The fire crackled on the hearth- the rising wind moaned round the house, the clock upon the mantel ticked busily, in haste to mark the flight of time - but louder than all, could they but have heard, was the beating of their hearts; the ban- shee moaning in their souls, warning of coming evil, and with them Time stood still. But these hearts, condemned to suffer in silence, spoke never- theless, eloquently to their owners. "Why, if he loves me, does he not say so?" murmured An- nette's, repeating the -same refrain over and over. And-"Saints and angels defend me!" ejaculated Walter's, "or I shall forget duty, honor, aught but that I love her; and, falling at her feet, reveal the feelings that absorb me." Brighter and brighter burned the fire, whispering delirious dreams to the two who were gazing at it, saying--"Look at each other, and not at me, and read the dread secret --Love!"

You do not deserve the girl; therefore you will win her, according to the common rule of life, where the undeserving reap all the rewards. This, from Your friend, DIOGENES." This letter sealed and despatched, Walter felt much more comfortable, and tried earnestly to persuade himself that he looked forward with pleasure to Herbert's arrival. This was not such an easy thing to do, however, with Annette sitting be'ore him, fondling her little dog, and casting shy glances of invitation towards him, to lure him from his desk. "No," he said to himself, stoically, '"I will not stir from where I am. Since she is to be another's wife, the farther away I keep the better." Annette was at a loss to understand the sudden change in his manner, or why he did not come to her side as usual; and, after having made up    her mind that for some unknown reason  he intended to forget their evening lesson, she rose up to go to bed. "You seem to be very much absorbed," she said, as she passed him on her way out of the room, "so absorbed that you in have forgotten our German lesson.' "I will not stop now, even if he asks me," she said to her- self, with a  slight sense of indignation; nevertheless, she paused to give him an opportunity to speak. "Eh  ? What ?  "  said Walter, with a  start, but without raising his eyes from the papers that apparently engaged his attention. "Oh, yes, I  am very busy; good-night," and he tossed about a lot of old bills, with the abstracted air of an overworked man. "Good-night," replied Annette tartly, as she hastened out of the room, ashamed of the hope that he might ask her to -: remain, which had caused her to linger. Walter threw himself back in his chair with a sigh of relief. "There, she is gone," he said to himself. "Temptation is  out of the way for to-night; but what am I to do to-morrow, and again to-morrow? with her pretty face and winning ways, - meeting me at every turn? Good God! the path of virtue is by no-means strewed with roses I " "Is anything the matter?" asked Elizabeth, attracted by the sigh, which was deep and profound, and looking anxiously over her spectacles at Walter.

"The farm is all right enough," replied Walter, "it is my ; private ledger that will not bear inspection."  "Then do not inspect it to-night," said Elizabeth. "To- - morrow I will go over it with you, when you feel fresh and ; bright." "Thank you," said Walter, with a smile, "I will take your  advice, and close it until to-morrow;" but this book when once I opened, is not so easily closed again, and he remained studying it far into the night.     &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC8179-00000109"/> 222        ,ANNETTE; OR, CHAPTER XXVI. CROSS-PURPOSES. NT OTHNG had prospered with Herbert of late. He had come to his work, eager to satisfy his rector, his congre- gation, and his own conscience; but he had found it impossible so to do, and the effect upon his spirits was depressing in the extreme. Mr. Crosbie was a well-meaning, good-tempered old gentle- man, who ruled his flock with a benignant sway. Very indul- gent to the follies of youth, he rarely if ever interfered with the consciences of those under him, being well satisfied so long as theyicommitted no flagrant breach of the law. Herbert's predecessors had left him with regret, and still remembered him with affection, and he had never been known to be harsh or unjust in his judgment of any one. This good man, however, had one failing, and it was owing to this that Herbert and he could never agree. He was very lax in the performance of his duty, as rector; and rather en- couraged than rebuked his congregation in a disregard of forms and ceremonies. Often and often had the church remained closed whole weeks at a time, and the service, at the best of times, was but irregularly and badly conducted. This state of things, as might be expected, shocked Herbert exceedingly. Fresh from his studies, and with exalted ideas on the subject of his duty to the flock under his care, he threw himself heart and soul into the work of regeneration. The church-bell was found, and re-hung in the belfry, from whence it rang out its summons far too often to please the lazy   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       223 congregation. Then, the school-house was renovated, and the names of the children of the parish entered in a large book, for the purpose of organizing a Sunday-school; but alas! it is easier to ring a bell than to bring a congregation to church; and to enter children's names in a book is one thing, but to bring them to Sunday-school is another affair, entirely. This Herbert began to realize, as day after day he read the service to empty benches, or sat lonely and forlorn in the school-house, waiting for scholars that never came. In vain he went from house to house, exhorting and' beseeching; the worthy members of his church still slumbered of a Sunday morning, and the " little lambs," still frolicked in the gutters. How could Herbert expect them to rise betimes, when their rector never breakfasted until the service was half-over? Sun- day was a day of rest, and as such they continued to keep it. Poor Herbert, losing heart, applied to his chief and besought his assistance, but that good gentleman, although he listened quite patiently to all he had to say, suggested to him at the end of the conversation, that everything had gone on very well before his arrival, and that perhaps his zeal was carrying him too far; he, himself, saw no reason for so many services, and quite sympathized with his congregation. Herbert now gave up all, hope, and sent in his resignation; after which, he wrote to his father explaining his conduct. "It is worse than useless to remain here longer," he said in his letter, "I am, therefore, coming home immediately. Do not think that I am turning back my hand from the plough, for indeed, such is not the case; I am as zealous as ever in regard. to my work; but, what canr I do here, where I have no influ-  ence, and am regarded with suspicion by both pastor and flock, who consider me a papist in disguise, because I wish them to come to church more than once a month."  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC8179-00000110"/> 224        ANNETTE; OR; Walter's note crossed this letter on the way, consequently when it arrived, Herbert had already made all his arrangements to return to? . "Every cloud has a silver lining," he said, with a smile, as he read what Walter had written in regard to Annette. "Even if I have failed in the object that called me hither, yet I am now free to follow where my heart leads; " and with a light heart he turned his back upon the city, so lately the centre of his most earnest hopes, and set out for home and Annette. It was with mingled feelings that Walter received Herbert, on his first visit to Bellevue, and learned that he had come to P   not on a brief visit, as he had expected, but to make his home there for some time to come. "You went away for nothing, then?" said Walter, as they paced together up and down before the house. "You might just as well have stayed at home and been happy as I suggested. " "I have gained experience," said Herbert, laughing, "and now I have come back to 'be happy,' if I may." "There is no further obstacle in the way of your marrying?" said Walter, interrogatively. "None at all, I am happy to say," replied Herbert. "My father thinks it is the best thing that I can do. He wishes me to remain at home for a few years longer before I accept a charge; and, meanwhile, I am to look for a wife, that I may be able to settle to my work respectably, when the time comes for me to do so." "Did you not tell him that your wife was already chosen?" said Walter, " or is that still a secret?" "No; I did not think that was necessary," replied Herbert. "It will be quite time enough to mention the young lady's name when I see any prospect of success. At present I feel as if I ought to be presented to her again, as it may be that she has forgotten me."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       225 "Then, there is no necessity for a veil?" said Walter, with a dreary smile. "No, thank heaven," replied Herbert, with a laugh. "I can look at her with a clear conscience." "Miss Purden," said Walter, ushering Herbert into the library, where Annette was struggling with an irregular verb, "here is a gentleman who wishes to be presented to you." 'Mr. Wellesley," exclaimed Annette, rising and extending her hand to him, whilst a delicate rose-tint stole into her cheek, and her eyes shone with welcome. "Not entirely forgotten, you see," said Walter, with a dry laugh, whilst a pang of jealousy shot through his heart, at An- nette's evident pleasure -at meeting Herbert again. "Why, you did not think yourself forgotten, did you?" said Annette, looking reproachfully at him. "Did I not promise you my friendship when you went away, and did you think I could prove false to my promise in so short a time? You are not complimentary, to say the least." "I scarcely dared believe myself so happy as to have retained : so honorable a position during so prolonged an absence,'" replied Herbert, entirely overcome by her warm reception, and in a seventh-heaven of hope and delight. "I do not change with the wind," said Annette, casting a , defiant glance at Walter, and recalling what he had told her of Herbert's love affairs. "A promise once given is forever sacred with me, and had you been absent twice as long, I would have welcomed you as gladly, and with as much sincerity." "I have no doubt you would," exclaimed Herbert, casting his eyes upon Walter in his turn, with a look of triumph, which said, "Did I not tell you she would remain true?" "I hum- bly apologize for questioning your constancy for a moment, and P  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8179-00000111"/> 226       ANNETTE; OR, need hardly tell you with what happiness I find myself in the wrong." "Faugh!" ejaculated Walter to himself, "what sickening things lovers are! Just hear how they go on. Rabid, as mad dogs, about constancy, mutual -vows, and all such stuff!" "I beg your pardon," he said aloud, " but I have an engage- ment which will detain me for an hour or so; will you kindly excuse me for that time?" "Certainly," said Annette. "Don't make a stranger of me," said Herbert. "Come back soon," said Annette. "I Don't be long," echoed Herbert. "Oh, no! certainly not," exclaimed Walter, galled beyond bearing by their feigned anxiety to have him with them. "I will be back long before you want me," he muttered, as he strode -away. ".Your return home is quite unexpected, is it not?" inquired Annette, when they were left alone. "Yes," replied Herbert, flushing a little; "I did--expect to remain in New York some time longer, but - I - was unfor- tunate--and so -you know- I thought it best to return to P   for the present." "Oh," said Annette, making a little round O of her mouth, and bringing out the monosyllable with so prolonged and cooing a sound that it stood for quite a sentence, but left Her- bert rather perplexed as to how to continue the conversation. "He was ' unfortunate! ' that means, that he found his ' doll ' was stuffed with saw-dust, I suppose," thought Annette, in the pause that ensued. "Well, I am sorry for him; but it is just what might have been expected." Notwithstanding her sorrow, she looked rather triumphant than otherwise, as she turned to him, saying sweetly: "Were your affairs so entirely hopeless that you were obliged to leave?"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       227 "Yes," replied Herbert; "there was no help for it. I made a bitter mistake in judging of another's feelings by my own, and when I found it out, there was nothing left but to part company."  "My father approves entirely of the step I have taken," he continued, as Annette did not speak. "He says there was nothing else for me to do." "Oh, I have no doubt you d/id what was best," said Annette, patronizingly," and I should have thought you would know more on the subject than your father." "The trouble is that I was too young," replied Herbert, confidentially. "I allowed myself to be guided by my feel- ings, when I should have followed the dictates of my reason, and not expected impossibilities." "Ah!" sighed Annette, "the feelings are not always to be trusted; they are dangerous guides." "So I found them," replied Herbert; " and you may depend upon it, that I will never try my fate again until years have developed my judgment." "You are very wise," said Annette. "I highly appreciate your resolution. You are very young to settle yourself for life!" "I am so glad you think so," said Herbert, brightening im- mediately under her approving look. "Do you know that my chief anxiety has been lest you should be displeased with me!" "I displeased with you 1 " exclaimed Annette, looking at  - him in dignified surprise. "What cause have I fordispleasure?" "Does he suppose that I care how often he falls in love?" thought she, indignantly. "None, personally, of course," said Herbert, very much abashed at having appeared to associate her so closely with himself. "But I feared that, as an impartial observer, you might not have approved my course of action." f-  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC8179-00000112"/> 228        ANNETTE; OR; "You are much the best judge of your own affairs," replied Annette, coldly. "I should not think of even expressing an opinion on the subject." "Have you missed me very much?" inquired Walter, enter- ing the room, with a sarcastic smile upon his face. "I am sorry I was detained so long, but I could not help myself. How jolly you both look," he observed, grimly. "What can you have found to talk about all this time?" "Nothing of any interest," replied Annette, "so pray give us some new subject, instead of requesting a repetition of our stupidity." "If I had guessed that you had so little to say to each other," said Walter, "I would have had pity, and taken you with me to the stables, whither I went to see after a horse I think of purchasing. A magnificent animal, by Jove! you ought to have seen him go through his paces." "What is his color?!' inquired Herbert. "Golden bay," replied Walter. "He has a head like a deer; a beautiful tail and mane, and bears himself as proudly as a peacock." "Can we not see this paragon of perfection?" inquired Annette. "Not to-day," replied Walter, "his owner has taken him home; but he is to come for my answer to-morrow, and as I have made up my mind to take him, you will have many an-, other opportunity, I hope." "You had better not be in a hurry to purchase," said Eliza- beth, as she entered the room, "remember that beautiful horse you bought two years ago, which proved to be stone-blind, and walked into the quarry before he had been with us a week." "That was an unfortunate speculation certainly," said Wal- ter, laughing, "but it was not quite so bad as it seemed; I   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       229 knew the horse had lost his eyesight when I bought him, but I thought he would make'a good plough-horse, which he would have done without doubt, had he not wandered into the quarry before he was tried, owing to the bars of the fence being down on that side of the enclosure where he was turned out." "Is it not that field which you now call your race-course?" inquired Annette. "Why did you let down the bars? I am sure it has a gate large enough to secure an elephant." "Yes," said Elizabeth. "That gate is illustrative of Wal- ter's character. As long as there was necessity for one, the enclosure remained gateless, but after all the available stock had broken their necks in the quarry, he erected the present stupendous affair; what for, heaven knows! for there is nothing passes that way now but the little milk-boy." "Probably he erected it to the memory of the dear departed," said Herbert. "Or in case he should invest in another blind horse," re- marked Annette. "I intended to have it put up about four years ago," said Walter, joining in the laugh against himself, "but it always takes me two years to think of an improvement, and, in the meantime, the stupid beasts walked overboard. It was not my fault, I am sure. If they had only given me time, the gate would have been up; but they were misanthropic cattle, and deliberately committed suicide, to the great loss of their owner." "Do not go," continued Walter, as Herbert rose from his seat to take his leave. "We expect you to remain with us the rest of the day, and Miss Purden shall drive you out this after- . noon in her own particular equipage." This was too pleasant an offer to be refused, so Herbert re- sumed his seat, and passed the rest of the day with them, : ;I leaving for home at night-fall, in a very thoughtful state of mind. 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8179-00000113"/> 230        ANNETTE; OR, He had passed a delightful day, without doubt, and yet there had been a restraint in Annette's manner that he had never noticed before. She seemed determined to avoid personalities, and although, during their drive, she had chatted away cheer- fully, she never broached the subject nearest his heart--his recent failure - nor gave him an opportunity to unbosom him- self of his troubles. Was it want of interest, or was it maidenly modesty that prevented her? He did not know enough of women to decide, but he made up his mind to act cautiously in his suit, nor frighten and perhaps lose her by a too sudden avowal of his feelings. That evening after tea Walter sat before his desk temporizing with himself. Since his last scare, the German lessons had been dropped; but he felt that a renewal of them was the only way in which he could have Annette to himself for a time; for now Herbert had arrived, he would probably monopolize her. She would be leaving him soon, without doubt, and he must enjoy her society whilst he could; so rising, he crossed the room to where she was sitting, working industriously, saying: "Are you too busy'for a lesson this evening?" "Eh? what? oh, yes; I am very busy," replied Annette, bending assiduously over her work. Walter felt a little throb of pleasure at the sharp tone of her voice, which seemed to denote pique. Did she, too, miss the lessons, and feel vexed at him for discontinuing them? The thought was too pleasant to be lightly dropped; and, after a moment's pause, he said: "May I read to you, then? Surely that will not interrupt your work, and it will be good practice for you, to translate as we go along." "I have no objection to your reading," said Annette, "but I doubt if I shall understand what you read."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         231 "If you do not I will translate," replied Walter, taking some books from the case and seating himself beside her. "I am going to read you some poetry," he said. "I have a collection here of German poets, and we will pick out the gems- from them all." Swiftly the evening sped away in this pleasant occupation, and by degrees Annette forgot to be busy, and,dropping her work upon her knees, devoted herself to translating. "Now," she said at length, "I have murdered these poems sufficientcy, translate- me something yourself, as a reward." Walter took up another volume from the table and turned ,over the leaves, saying: "I have a dim remembrance of having written a translation of one of these poems, by the side of it, but I do not recollect which it was. Here it is!" he exclaimed, as his eye fell upon a page thickly covered with writing. "Wieland's ' Serafina.'" "Eswar um Mitternacht - " began Walter. "Stop!" cried Annette.  "The translation! I will have the translation!" Walter hesitated a moment, and then proceeded: "It was, at midnight," etc. His voice gained in richness and power as the exquisite poetry made itself felt within his soul, and Annette, breathless and expectant, leaned forward in her seat, drinking in every word. Surely Walter felt what he read; so pathetic was his voice, that one could have easily imagined him to be speaking from his own heart; and so thought Annettej as the tears shone in her eyes in unison with the passion in his tones. a' O would that thou couldst close for me mine eye, O could one burning tear but fall         V From out thine eye, and my cold cheek bedew, How gladly would I buy it with each drop of blood, That creepeth still along these veins!"  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8179-00000114"/> 232    .    ANNETTE; OR,  Walter spoke this rather than read it, for his eyes were fixed upon Annette, and in his face she read his secret plainly. No need of words between them; heart spoke to heart! The book fell unheeded on the floor, and still they gazed into each other's eyes, as though they would read forever the story written there! "What atrocious nonsense!" exclaimed Elizabeth, from the opposite side of the table, breaking in rudely upon their dreams. "What was the name of the fool who wrote that? He ought to have been hung; or at least, imprisoned. It is through allowing such creatures to go at large that the whole moral atmosphere is poisoned." CHAPTER XXVII. A RACE FOR LIFE. T  HERE was not much sleep for Annette that night. She had crossed the boundary-line and become a woman; her girlhood seemed a thing of the past; and as she tossed rest- lessly from side to side, during the long night, her glowing heart wrought dreams with golden threads, and ever in the foreground stood Walter, monarch of the world. Oh! for to-morrow! would to-morrow never come? and then she turned again and thought how he would look and what he would say when they next met. The wished-for morning dawned at last, and the earliest sun- beam caught Annette before the looking-glass, parting, smooth- ing and curling her hair. After which she put on her prettiest dress, tied a knot of ribbon at her throat, and looked at her- self again and again, to be sure that she had left nothing   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         233 undone, whereby she could make herself pleasing in the eyes of him she loved. This observation of herself in the glass was not, however, satisfactory; for excitement had stolen the roses from her cheeks, and a sleepless night had painted lines beneath her eyes. "I never looked so plain," she sighed, as she went her way to breakfast, and - "She never looked so lovely," groaned Walter, as with a shy, yet blissful look, she took her seat at the table. But her happiness was of short duration; for a stolen glance at Walter, showed her that the past night had also left its trace upon his face. Indeed, he looked as though he had not been to bed at all. His smoothly brushed hair and scrupulously neat toilet, be- tokened the extra care which one expends upon such things, when one is desirous of hiding emotion, and anxious to distract attention from one's physiognomy; but nothing could dis- guise his blood-shot eyes and his extreme pallor, which were only the more obvious for his care. After the first glance at Annette, as she took her seat, he never turned his eyes again in her direction, but kept them fixed upon his plate, whilst he went through the form of eating, mechanically, like a somnambulist. Annette, distressed and bewildered, tried to follow his ex- ample, but with less success, for the food choked her, and, try as she might, her eyes would wander to his face. "Walter! what ails you?" exclaimed Elizabeth, suddenly, pausing in the act of passing' a cup to Annette, as she, for the first time perceived the change in his appearance from the night before. "Nothing," replied Walter.  "Why do you ask such a question?" 20   &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8179-00000115"/> 234        ANNETTE; OR, "You look so odd," said Elizabeth, regarding him attentively. "I passed a sleepless night," said Walter, "which accounts for my not looking as bright as usual.' "A sleepless night!" echoed Elizabeth. "My dear boy you look rather as if you had passed a sleepless week.' What kept you awake? No return of your fever, I hope?" "Oh, no," replied Walter, "I was restless, that was all; I am quite well this morning." "You do not take enough exercise," said Elizabeth, "that is the trouble. Annette," she continued, turning to her with a smile, "I think you must ' exercise' him three times a day, as you did Pudge. Do you think he will be tractable without the ribbon?" "I can but try," said Annette, blithely. "We will order the horses this morning, immediately after breakfast, which will give us time to take a walk also before dinner, and after that is over, we can take another ride. What do you say to the pro- gramme?" she added, turning to Walter with an arch smile. "It is an admirable one," he replied, still without looking at her, " but unfortunately for me, I have an engagement which will probably keep me occupied all day. It need make no difference in your plans, however, for Mr. Wellesley intends to ride over here, and will, I am sure, be pleased to accompany you." "I will not trouble him, thank you," replied Annette, strug- gling with her distressed and mortified feelings. "If you are engaged, I will not ride to-day." "Just as you please," replied Walter, slightly inclining his head. "You know that Rodger is yours to order whenever you desire to go out;" saying which, he rose from his seat and abruptly left the room. "Walter is not well," said Elizabeth, decidedly. "He   I n n U CKMUNAJ LE.; b UOF tELLELVUE.  235 never will confess to being sick; but I always know when he is, nevertheless. I think I will follow him," she added, rising, "and, if possible, ascertain the real state of the case." Left to herself, Annette tried to reconcile Walter's present behavior with his extreme devotion the previous evening; but it seemed impossible to regard him as the same person. Had she mistaken the cause of his evident emotion after read- ing the poem, or had daylight brought with it calm reflection, and a revulsion of feeling on his part? In either case, it was plain that the "Chateau en Espagne," which she had built during the night, had no foundation, and must fall to the ground. Alas! if it should bury her in its ruins! With an effort she aroused herself from these painful reflec- tions, and went about her usual morning avocations, but with a stern resolve to banish the recreant Walter from her heart, and be more chary of her smiles and services in future. Notwithstanding this high-minded resolve, however, she refused to ride with Herbert when he arrivred, having a vague notion that Walter might repent his refusal, and re-appear upon the scene before the morning was over; in which case he must, of course, be forgiven, and received again into favor. But he came not, even at dinner-time, and they sat down to that meal without him. "I do not know where he is gone," said Elizabeth. "I could learn nothing from him this morning. All that he vouch- safed to say on the subject was, that he should try his new horse this afternoon, and then he gave me a polite invitation to sit on the fence and watch his evolutions." "He is ' horse-mad! '" said Herbert. "On my way here this morning I met him hunting the country over for a peculiar kind of bit, that he deemed necessary for his animal, and I sent him to my father's stable, where I thought it likely he might find one to suit him."  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC8179-00000116"/> 236        ANNETTE; OR, Elizabeth and Herbert were obliged to support the conversa- tion; for Annette heard no more than the first few sentences, when her mind began to wander to Walter and his unusual conduct. Had he really no engagement, then? had he simply men- tioned one as an excuse for absenting himself from her society? Her cheeks burned at the thought. "Mr. Wellesley," she said at length, turning towards him, "I have come to the conclusion that I would like to ride, if you will allow me to change my mind. Have you any engage- ment for this afternoon?" "None at all," replied Herbert, promptly. "It will give me great pleasure to go with you. At what time will you be ready?" "I think we had better go as soon as possible," she replied; "the afternoons are not as long as they were, and it is very damp after the sun sets." "I will go to the stables, then, if you will allow me, imme- diately after dinner," said Herbert, " and order the horses." "Thank you! that will suit very well," replied Annette, and again relapsed into silence. "Which way shall we go?" asked Herbert of Annette, as he mounted his horse, she being already upon hers. "Shall we take the straight road, where every one goes?" "It is so very dusty there," said Annette, by way of reply. "Then let us go over the hills; we shall not find any dust there," said Herbert. "I am always so timid when my horse is clambering over rocks!" sighed Annette. "Suppose we remain in the enclosure, then?" said Herbert; "it will be pleasant and shady in the woods." "Just as you please," replied Annette, submissively, but   nH   CnKOUNICLES;L5 OF BELLEVUE.    237 casting down her eyes, lest her satisfaction at the route she had compelled him to suggest should be too plainly read on her countenance. If Walter was trying his new horse, he would probably be upon the course, which was a field on the right of the road to the woods, and if they went that way, they must necessarily meet him; but it was unnecessary to tell Mr. Wellesley that it was for this purpose alone that she had consented to ride with him. "I must see him," said Annette to herself, " if only to show him how indifferent I am to his absence or presence." But Walter was not on the course, nor anywhere within sight, and Annette, sad and disappointed,repented of her impulse to find him, which had only entailed upon her the arduous duty of entertaining Herbert, when she felt she had nothing to say to him. He was not at all concerned at her silence, however, but kept up a steady flow of words, which fell unheeded upon Annette's ear, as long as she could command a view of the course or the stables. When they entered the woods, and the high trees obscured them, Annette did endeavor to force her attention to the con- versation, the thread of which it seemed impossible to catch. The first intelligible sentence that she heard was - "My father, therefore, thinks it best for me to marry imme- diately, and live with him for a few years before I assume the responsibility of a charge and a home of my own." "A strange prescription for a man who has just lost his'sweet- heart," thought Annette; but she said aloud- "That will be the best plan, without doubt; I would cer- tainly follow your father's advice."  "It ought to be good," said Herbert; " he knows so much more of these things than I do."  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8179-00000117"/> 238        ANNETTE; OR, "That is a remarkable acknowledgment," thought Annette. "He thinks," continued Herbert,-" that I do not quite know my own mind, at present; and that he can materially assist me in making my future choice. He says it is most important that I should be settled immediately.:' "But suppose," said Annette, with a puzzled expression, "that your feelings become unsettled again, after your marriage, what then is to become of your wife?" "Oh, it will make no difference to her," replied Herbert. ' In any case my father binds himself to take care of her as long as she lives." "This is an unique arrangement," thought Annette. "He is to ask some girl-of his father's choosing-to marry him, for the purpose of steadying his vacillating affections, his father binding himself on his part, even in case of failure, to provide for her support to the end of her days. Did he really say that, or arih I dreaming?" Her newly awakened interest in the conversation died, how- ever, a sudden death, is an opening in the shrubbery revealed once more the race-course; and as Annette, bending an earnest gaze upon it, fancied she could discern thereon a solitary horseman. It might be George, or Peter, or John; but it might also be Walter Westhrooke, and she would like to know which it really was. "Mr. Wellesley," she exclaimed, checking her horse, "let us go back, it is so damp here that I fear I shall take cold." "Is it damp?" asked Herbert anxiously, instantly turning his horse's head. "Why did you not mention it before? I trust you have not taken cold. Pray do not go so fast," he added, as she hurried Rodger over stock and stone. "My horse is not sure-footed, and I. shall come to grief among these stumps if I endeavor to keep pace with you."   THE CHRONICLES OF'-BELLEVUE.       239. "I will wait for you outside of the woods," she replied, reso- lutely pushing on through brake and brier, regardless of the damage her habit was experiencing. She paused on gaining the road, and had convinced herself of the fact that Walter was actually upon the course, before Herbert joined her. "Is that not Walter?" inquired he, as he caught up to her, shading his eyes with his hand. "Where?" asked Annette, innocently, and looking wide of the mark. "To the left," replied Herbert; "you are looking the wrong way. Do you not see him on the race-course?" "I see something," replied Annette. "Is that Mr. West- brooke?" "I think it is," replied Herbert; "but we can tell better when we get closer." They walked the horses along for a time in silence, and then Herbert returned to the charge. "Miss Purden," he said, " do you think a man has a right to marry under the circumstances I have mentioned?" "What circumstances?" inquired Annette, absently.--with her whole mind and heart centred on the figure they were ap- proaching. "When he is entirely dependent on his father for support?" replied Herbert. "Oh, yes; I suppose so," replied Annette, desperately. "If his father don't mind it, no one else has a right to object." "But could you respect such a man?" continued Herbert, eagerly. "Would you be willing to trust your future to him?" "I do not know, I am sure," replied- Annette. "I don't expect to trust my future to any one." "What!" exclaimed Herbert, in dismay. ".Do you never intend to marry?"  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8179-00000118"/> 240        ANNETTE; OR, "Of what consequence is it to you what I intend to do?  exclaimed Annette, pettishy. "You know it is a great deal of consequence," said, Herbert, in a tone of suppressed emotion. 'You surely do not require me to tell you that my happiness is inextricably bound up in your future! that I have never loved but one woman and she is " "Good heavens!" interrupted Annette, excitedly, "what is that horse doing, Mr. Wellesley?" and she pointed as she spoke towards the course, which was now but a short distance from them. Poor Herbert, thus suddenly cut short in a proposition, ral- lied himself with an effort, and looked in the direction she indicated, where Walter was struggling for mastery with an evidently unmanageable beast. " He wishes to have his own way," he replied. "I fear Walter has bitted him too lightly. Ah! that Awas a narrow es- cape!" he exclaimed, as the horse, rearing, swayed backward and forward and finally plunged down upon his fore-legs again. "Walter should give him his head," continued Herbert. "There! he has slackened his hold! No! he is pulling hard again-.-sawing - the reins! I believe the animal has the bit be- tween his teeth, and is running away."' "The gate! the gate!" shrieked Annette, who up to this time had been gazing with intense anxiety upon the horse's movements. "On, Mr. Wellesley, for Heaven's sake; ride fast! . The quarry gate is open, and the horse is running to- wards it!" Herbert perceived this fact at the same time as herself, and without a word drove his spurs into his horse's flanks, to put him at full speed. Away dashed the animal to the rescue; but Sir Rodger was   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.          24.t1 not to be left behind, neither did Rodger's mistress desire to be in the rear; so, neck to neck, ran the gallant steeds.

"Keep close!" shouted Herbert, after her. "Keep close I you are gaining on him! you are very near the gate!" "Rodger! Rodger! go on!" she cried, bringing both whip and reins to bear upon the animal, in her desperation to add force to her words; and, with an indignant snort, he bent him' self to his work with such good-will, that the remaining distance was accomplished as quick as thought Slacking her pace as well as she could, Annette threw herself from the saddle, and, grasping the heavy iron gate in both hands, pushed it to, and drove the bolt into its socket, just as Walter reached it from the other side. A horse swooping down upon her! a crash! a sound as of rushing waters! and Annette lay prostrate and unconscious before the gate!  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC8179-00000119"/> 242         ANNETTE; OR, CHAPTER XXVIII. WHY DID HE DO IT? "OWLY Annette returned to consciousness. First came a humming in her ears, then the sickening sensation of reviv- ing circulation, and lastly, as her eyes unclosed and rested upon the objects around her, the mind resumed its sway, and the events of the last few moments rushed back upon her like a flash. "Where is he?" she exclaimed, starting to her feet. "Wal- ter! Walter! where are you?" "Here! close beside you!" replied Walter, passing his arm around her. "Saved! saved!" cried Annette, in extreme agitation, clasp- ing her hands upon his arm, and looking up into his face. s Is this really yourself alive and well, or is it a dream? don't wake me if it is; let me dream on!" and then she alternately wept and laughed, to Walter's infinite alarm, whilst she trembled so that, but for his support, she must have fallen to the ground. !"Hush! hush!" said Walter, gently, endeavoring to calm her excitement. "Do not cry, Annette! I am safe and sound, and it is to you that I owe my life! It is not worth much, but you have saved it, and such as it is, it is yours forever and forever!" Annette's sobs ceased, and a great flood of happiness rolled in upon her, bringing with it total oblivion as to past troubles and misunderstandings, and leaving only the consciousness of present love, as Walter drew her head upon his breast, and en- folded her within his encircling arms.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       24 A moment passed, perhaps two - it might have been a cen- tury, as far as our lovers were concerned--when a voice fell upon their ears, saying . "' I have brought some water, but I perceive there is no longer any necessity for it." And, starting apart, they found Herbert standing before them with a cup of cold water, that he had brought from the stream near by, for the purpose of resuscitating Annette. She seemed in no very urgent need of cold water at that mo- ment, unless, indeed, it were to cool her burning cheeks, and both Walter and herself stood mute, as before an accusing spirit. "I hope you have entirely recovered?" continued Herbert, with a white face and constrained voice, but with noble gener- osity pitying her confusion, and wishing to cover it with the excuse of indisposition. As for Walter, he could feel -no pity for him; a deadly hate seemed growing in his heart towards thisman, who had urged him on to marry a girl with whom he was in love himself, and by whom he was evidently. loved in return. What was his motive? Herbert would have liked to force it from him, with his hand upon his throat; but he thrust his enmity from him, lest it should offend Annette, and devoted himself to reassuring her. What part had she in the underhanded game that had been played? He knew not; but he loved her, and in his eyes she could do no wrong. "Will you let me take you to the house?" he said, gently. "You do not look well; you have been through too much excitement." "Thank you," she said, gratefully, accepting his offered arm, and turning from Walter without a glance. "Perhaps he will think I was ill, and Walter was supporting - me," she thought, as she turned away with him, and this reflec-  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC8179-00000120"/> 244         ANNETTE; OR, tion gave her courage to look Herbert in the face again, and try to answer his questions connectedly. "I am so much exhausted," she said. "I never rode so hard before." "You acted nobly," replied Herbert. "It is remarkable the courage -that an emergency will sometimes bring forth. Who would have thought that the timid girl I brought to this house some months ago could have ridden at full speed along that narrow road, without a thought of fear, or a glance at the precipice yawning beside her. If Rodger had shied, if you had pulled the wrong rein, you Would have been lost yourself." "I know it!" replied Annette, with a shudder; " but I did not, think of myself at all, just then; I was in such terror in regard to Mr. Westhrooke. How did he escape?" "Just as you closed the gate his horse neared it," replied Herbert, " and being unable to check himself, raised for a leap, but the gate was too high and he fell back, the shock fortu- nately throwing Walter entirely clear of him, or he must have been crushed by his weight." "Oh, it is too horrible I " cried Annette ; "do let us speak of something else." "Here is Fiddle coming to meet you," said Herbert, " and wagging his tail as complacently as though it were not at all an unusual occurrence for us to go out on horse-back, and return arm-in-arm; but Miss Mordaunt, who is behind him, does not seem to be of the same opinion; she looks very much alarmed." "Will you please explain to her what has happened?" said Annette, imploringly, "I feel as if it would be impossible for me to go over it all again."               A "Certainly," replied Herbert, relinquishing the hand upon   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       245 his arm, and stepping up to Elizabeth, whilst Annette, with-a hurried apology, hastened on alone to the house. Herbert explained briefly to Elizabeth what had taken place, but found it almost impossible to persuade her that Walter was uninjured. "Why did he not come home with you, then?" she inquired, with ill-concealed suspicion. "I do not know, indeed," replied Herbert; "he assured me that he was uninjured, and I devoted myself to Miss Purden, who was very much shaken by the accident." "Oh, of course!" ejaculated Elizabeth, "you men never think of each other, if there is a woman about. I wish to good- ness the child had stayed at home." "Then, in all human probability, Mr. Westhrooke would be now lying under his horse, at the bottom of the quarry," replied Herbert. "How do I know that he is not?" exclaimed Elizabeth. "He would be here to speak for himself, if nothing had befallen him." "Shall I look for him?" said Herbert, feeling that it was a mission he would gladly have been saved, but that he was in duty bound to make the offer. "Do," said Elizabeth, mollified at once, "and tell him to come to me immediately; that I shall know no peace until I have seen him." Herbert retraced his steps slowly and musingly. He had not had time to determine what he should say to Walter when he next met him, and he had no wish to meet him unprepared, lest the hot indignation burning within him should overpower his better feelings. An explanation of some sort, Walter was bound to give him, and, as a gentleman, he knew he would not refuse it; but one 21 *  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8179-00000121"/> 246        ANNETTE; OR, thing therefore remained to be done, and that was to await it- in silence; in that case, too, he would be saved from saying that which he might afterwards repent. Walter was just where he had left him, seated on a large stone overlooking the quarry. Herbert approached him, and delivered Elizabeth's message, in a cold, formal tone, and then turned to leave him without waiting for a response. "Wait a moment, if you please," said Walter. "H have something of importance to say to you." "Speak on," replied Herbert, arresting his steps at a short distance from him, and leaning against the gate. "I know you think I have wronged you, Herbert," began Walter, "and it may be that I have; but it was done unwit- tingly, if done at all." "It depends very much upon the light in which you look at it," replied Herbert, "whether the wrong be great or small. From  your point of view, the stealing of a girl's affections, whilst you encourage her lover in false hopes, is perhaps a y matter of no consequence; but the dupe looks upon it with another eye." "I have never tried to steal her affections!" exclaimed Walter, starting up and confronting him. "So far from that, I have tried to avoid her; and when I found that she was steal- ing my heart, I went to you, like a man, and urged you to return and marry her. You know what you answered: that, if she loved you, shee would continue to do so; and if she could love some one else, you would not be the barrier in the way! Can you deny that?" "No," replied Herbert. "H have no desire to deny it; I would repeat the same thing again, were you to urge the same course. Had you openly sued for her hand, and told me of   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       247 your love, you would have been free from blame, and I would have taken your hand in friendship, and wished you happiness, even though it broke my heart to give up its treasure; but did you do this? did you not rather lead me to believe that you had no personal interest in her; that, for both our sakes, you were anxious for me to marry her? did you not impress upon me that you believed she loved me, and you cared for her through pure disinterested friendship for myself? In your last note (it is here) did you not tell me she was pining for me? Pining, forsooth! when I find her in your arms! Walter West- brooke, where was your sense of honor,' on which you pride yourself so much, when you could thus deceive a friend?" "You are right, and yet you are wrong!" exclaimed Walter, pacing up and , down in agitation. "If I had deliberately set about doing all you accuse me of, I should, indeed, be a villain; but I have done my best to do my duty, although sorely tried at times, and if once or twice I have missed my way, it is not my fault, but my misfortune. Do not interrupt me," he con- tinued, as he perceived Herbert was about to speak. '-I heard you patiently; bore all your abuse without a word; grant me the same indulgence. To begin with, you are taking a great deal for granted when you speak of my having stolen the young. lady's affections. Who informed you that they were mine? for it is a fact of which I am still in ignorance myself." "Stop there!" cried Herbert, indignantly. "You shall not say such a thing in my presence! You do not know that she loves you, when she allowed you to hold her in your arms, and laid her head upon your breast! dare you say she would have done it with another?"        - "She was hysterical," replied Walter, "and could scarcely stand from over-excitement; it was necessary to support her.

This much I can certify, that I have never spoken a word of love to her in my life; and I doubt if another man would have acted as honor- ably in my position. That I love her, I freely confess; but surely that is no sin. That she loves me I do not believe; whilst I utterly disclaim any intention of winning her from you, or of having any aspirations towards her hand. Does that satisfy you?" "Walter," replied Herbert, slowly, and as one who is con- vinced against his will, "if you speak the truth (and I feel constrained to believe that you do), I have to apologize for wronging you grievously. - If it be as you say, that nothing definite has passed between yourself and Miss Purden, let by- gones be by-gones; and let us start fairly in the race from the present time; knowing ourselves to be rivals, but nevertheless good friends, and giving each other no grounds henceforth for the accusation of duplicity.' I am willing to play my part in the light of day; and I only ask you to do the same, that, whatevtr the sequel, we may shake hands as honorable men, to the end of the chapter." "With all my heart, I agree!" exclaimed Walter, grasping the hand Herbert extended to him, warmly in his own; "only with this exception, old fellow, that I will not be your rival either secretly or openly. Try your luck first, whilst I stand on one side and watch, with the understanding that I do nothing whatever, until your fate is sealed. If you win the prize, then my best wishes shall go with it, but if you fail-do you under- stand? if you fail-then you will come to me and frankly avow the same. Is that satisfactory?" "Entirely," replied Herbert; ", it is even more than that, it is generous of you to give me the first chance." ' As you once said to me," replied Walter, with a dreary smile, "I can wait. Good-night."   THE. CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        249 ,' Good-night," replied Herbert, accepting his dismissal with a good grace, although he had hoped to be invited to spend the evening at Bellevue. He walked quietly home, with his heart once more at peace, and a determination that it should not be his fault if Arinette were not very soon his wife. Walter pursued his way home in a very different frame of mind. He had been playing with fire, and it had burned him. Long ago, when he had first -found himself failing, he should have done what he was now about to do; but he had put it off from time to time, until now it was too late, as far as he was concerned, and perhaps-yes, perhaps, it was too late for  * Annette. "God grant it may be as I have said, and she does not love me!" he groaned, as this thought took possession of him; and then he quickened his pace as he remembered that this was the last night that he could listen to her voice, and feast his eyes upon her face, that had grown to be almost a necessity to his existence. 'Ask me not why this man, no longer in the first bloom of manhood, should have thus loved one, little more than a child, and with capacities very inferior to his own. There are stranger anomalies in love than in the material world, and this was one of them.                        ' He loved her, perhaps, for her pretty face -perhaps for her artless, winning ways; or, perchance, for the spotless purity of her heart, so unlike the women he had known; but this answer, perhaps, comes nearer the truth, that he loved her, because he did! All too quickly the evening sped; and, with a start, he awoke to the fact that Annette was bidding him good-night. - "Is it so late?" he asked as a condemned criminal might; "Is it time?" when the headsman stands beside him.  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC8179-00000123"/> 250        ANNETTE; OR, "Oh, no; it is not very late," replied Annette; "but Miss Mordaunt thinks I had better go to bed a little earlier than: usual to-night." "Let me light your candle for you," said Walter, -taking the candlestick from her hand; but, instead of lighting it, he walked abstractedly out of the room. Supposing he was looking for a lighter, Annette followed him to the end of the hall, where he suddenly placed the candlestick -upon the table, and grasped both of her hands in his. The hall was lighted only by the moon shining through the window, and as Walter stood in the shadow, she could not see his face; but the pressure of her hands became absolutely pain- ful, and a dread foreboding seized her, that he had something sad to tell her. "Annette," he said, at length, struggling with his emotion, '"I told you a few hours ago that my life was yours forever; I meant it then, and I mean it now, but not, perhaps, as you might suppose. "Your friend I am for life; and if aught befall you, and you know not where to turn for help, then remember me; for, whether beside you, or a hundred miles away, your image will be ever with me! My life is passed, and a shadow of happiness is all -that I can ever call my own this side of the grave; but yours has just begun. My child, you must not waste it on an empty vision. There are men, noble, chivalrous, large-hearted men, who would give their lives for such as you, and deem it no hardship. Ah! if such an one should cross your path, do not turn away from him, I beseech you. Give him that price. less jewel, your heart, and Hand H-will find my happiness in yours!" He ceased speaking, then raised the little hands he held to- his lips; a burning kiss fell first upon one, then upon the   THE CHRONICLES OF- BELLEVUE.       25I. other, and he was gone before Annette realized what had hap- pened. Half-stupefied, she groped her way to her room, lighted her candle, and sat down to endeavor to grasp the meaning of this strange interview. The night passed on apace; the moon hid herself behind g cloud, and the lights of the village went out one by one, all save the red light at the tavern, which awaited the midnight coach. Still Annette sat and dreamed above, whilst Walter, as sleepless, watched below. The old clock upon the stairway struck eleven; every stroke went home to Walter's heart. As the reverberation died away, he arose with the air of a man whose course of action is decided, and taking from beside him a note addressed to the "Rev. Herbert Wellesley," and a travelling-bag, he put on his hat, threw his cloak over his arm, and left the house. As once before, a little streak of light was visible upon the grass, and at sight of it Walter' paused and looked up, knowing well from whence it came. The blind was drawn, but upon it a shadow rested, - the shadow of a delicate profile and a girlish figure, sitting in pen- sive attitude within, Walter stood and gazed upon it, as though he would imprint those lineaments upon his heart forever. Something touched his hand, he looked down, and Fideie stood beside him. "Fidele!" he said, in a broken voice, "Fidele, youare hap- pier than I! You are not to be driven from your home, to wander, a vagabond, upon the earth!" He stooped, and taking the little dog in his arms, hid his face in its soft, warm hair. But now the shadow moved.

The strong man's frame quivered from exces- sive emotion, and he seemed rooted to the spot. ' Fidele," now the voice sounded anxious and distressed, and the night air was blowing in upon her; he must let the , dog go. "Good-bye, Fidele," he said. "Go to her; lay in her arms, and tell her, if your coat is wet, it is not with the early dew- from the clouds; but that wrung from the eyes of a man who will love her whilst he has life!" Released from his hold, Fidele scampered away over the grass to his mistress who caught him up in her arms and covered him with kisses, exclaiming: "Oh! you naughty runaway! what a fright you have given me!-." then retreating into the house, the door closed, and the light went out,--not only in the house, but in Walter West- brooke's heart!   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        25 3 CHAPTER XXIX. SKIRMSHNG. T-HE next morning when Herbert Wellesley descended to the breakfast-room, he found the following note beside his plate: "I am off, Herbert, my boy, by the midnight coach. Where, heaven only knows! Why do I run away, you will perhaps ask. Because I am a coward! yes, I say it of myself, I am an arrant coward! and fear to trust myself in the face of danger. "Good-bye to you, then--perhaps for years-it may be for- ever. In any case, that Heaven may prosper you and yours is the earnest wish of         Your friend, W. W. - "P. S. Any communication you may desire to make to me address, under cover, to E. J. Potts, Esq., N. Y., and he will forward it." Herbert was obliged to read this note over several times be- fore he thoroughly mastered its contents. It seemed so incredible that Walter should go into voluntary exile, and leave the field to him without a blow struck in his own defence. In another sort of man such magnanimous conduct would have filled Herbert with admiration, but knowing Walter as well as he did, he was at a loss to understand such sudden generosity. He was a man almost entirely governed by his personal interest, and rarely gave his neighbor a thought, if he chanced ' to stand in his way. It was extraordinary, therefore, that he should be so willing, in this instance,- to give up the wish 22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC8179-00000125"/> 254        ANNETTE; ORI nearest his heart, in favor of one who had no possible claim upon his magnanimity. "Herbert," said Mrs. Wellesley, " your coffee will be cold, my dear; what is there in that note of such deep interest that one reading will not suffice?" Thus addressed, Herbert aroused himself from his abstrac- tion, and putting the note aside turned his attention to his breakfast. "Are we not to know the contents?" said his mother, with' a smile. "It is from Mr. Westhrooke, " replied Herbert, slightly em- barrassed, " he has left? ," "Left?  !" exclaimed Mrs. Wellesley. "You do not mean forever? Is it not a sudden determination on his part?" "He does not seem to know himself how long he will be absent," replied Herbert. "He is an eccentric fellow; I do not think he had any notion of going away when I parted from him last night." "His sister will miss him sadly," continued Mrs. Wellesley. "I never knew any one more devoted to a brother than she is to him." "CC The young lady will miss him more," said the elder Mr. Wellesley. "She has been his constant companion ever since he recovered from his recent illness. Almost every time I have gone out lately, I have met them, riding, driving or walking." "His note is concerning her, " said Herbert, blushing slightly. "He recommends her to my care during his absence." "Oh, ho," said Mr. Wellesley, smiling. "Lies the wind in that quarter?  Look out for yourself, young man; the guardianship of a pretty girl is a dangerous office to undertake for a friend." "He does not hamper me with any severe restrictions" /   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       255 replied Herbert, laughing; "in fact, he rather insinuates that if I can win the young lady's affections, he will give me' his fraternal blessing." "Very generous of him, I am sure," said Mr. Wellesley. "We did not have friends of that sort in our day, Nellie, did we?" he continued, addressing his wife. "Not many," she replied, with a quiet smile. "But you, Herbert," she continued, turning to her son with an anxious expression, " is this arrangement agreeable to you?" Herbert shifted uneasily upon his chair, looked down into his plate, played with his knife and fork, and ultimately left his seat and walked to the window, before he could muster sufficient courage to answer. "I don't mind it," he said at length, in evident confusion. "She is a very nice girl." A profound silence followed this remark, during which the Wellesleys, pere and mere, exchanged looks, but of an entirely different character. Pere Wellesley's said, with evident amuse- ment: "The young rogue has fallen in love!'" but Mere Wel- lesley's said, in dismay: "My boy loves some one more than me!" "Well, what is the matter?" asked Mr. Wellesley, at last breaking the silence. "By Jove, Herbert! your mother is going to cry!" and, leaning back in his chair, he indulged in a hearty laugh at the dreary expression of his wife's face. "Why, mother, dear," said Herbert, coming quickly to her side, " what have I said to grieve you?" and he put his arm around her affectionately.               - ^ "Nothing, dear, nothing! You have always been good and kind to me," said Mrs. Wellesley, in a dismal tone, as if, under the circumstances, it were a special affliction to remember that such was the fact.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC8179-00000126"/> 256        ANNETTE; OR, "' She therefore very reasonably resents the idea of your being 'good and kind' to any one else," said Mr. Wellesley. "But Nellie," he continued, checking his hilarity, " you must remem- ber, my dear, that when I married you I had a mother. My father, also, had one before me; and the same fact is related of my grandfather. It may be a family peculiarity, but we all had mothers, and we all got married. May-be it is the way of the world." "Of course, of course," said Mrs. Wellesley, making an effort to overcome her feelings. "I have no right to complain of you, Herbert; only you are all I have, and it seems so hard to give you up to any girl, however nice." "But mother, dear, is it not rather soon to mourn my loss, when I have not even questioned the young lady as to her feel- ings?" said Herbert. "Perhaps she will not have me." "That is not likely," replied his mother, looking with fond admiration at his handsome face. "She must needs be a very strange sort of girl that could help loving my boy." "Every crow thinks its own the whitest," said Mr. Wellesley. "No doubt Miss Whats-her-name's mother thinks there is not a man living worthy of her daughter." "Miss Purden has no mother," said Herbert, laughing. " She died at her daughter's birth." "Poor child!" said Mrs. Wellesley, in a tone of sympathy. "I did not know she was motherless. We must be kind to her, Herbert, lonely as she is. You must take her out riding, and I will take her visiting, and ask her to dinner and tea. Miss Mordaunt is a well-meaning woman, but not the sort of person to make a happy home for a young girl. We might ask her to stay with us for a while." "She is all right now, Herbert, my boy," said Mr. Wellesley,   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       257 with twinkling eyes; "before another week your mother will be hugging and kissing the girl, to make up to her the loss she never felt. Bless thy dear heart, Nellie!" he exclaimed, as he rose and kissed his wife; "L hadst thou as much room in thy house as thou hast in thy heart, we might open an orphan asy- lum. Go ahead, old woman, adopt as many as you will, but begin with Herbert's little girl." Soon 'after this conversation Herbert bent his steps towards Bellevue, loaded with tender messages and pressing invitations for Annette from his mother, whose interest was now thoroughly  aroused in her. But Annette was in no mood to appreciate these attentions. Her mind was absorbed by one fact - Walter was gone! Where he had gone, and why had he gone, she would fain know; but no one at Bellevue could answer these questions, and she had waited in feverish impatience for Herbert's daily visit, to see if he could give her any explanation. - The news had been a heavy blow to her, coming as it did so soon upon her discovery that Walter loved her, and she knew not how to bear it. "Why did he teach me to love him," she thought, "only to leave me when the lesson was well learned?" "Mr. Wellesley," she said, almost before he was seated, " do you know that Mr. Westhrooke has left us suddenly? He never mentioned his intention to any one last night; but, after we had a gone to bed, left the house and took his departure for--we know not where!"  "I am sure it was another attack of brain-fever," sighed -Eliz- abeth. "I saw it coming on! Don't you remember how excited he got over that wretched poem, Annette? And then his eyes i were. so blood-shot and swollen the next morning, and he con- fessed to having passed a sleepless night.?' 22*         R  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC8179-00000127"/> 258        ANNETTE; OR, "He looked very badly," replied Annette; "but he assured you that he felt quite well."- "Ah! he always says that," said Elizabeth, with a mournful shake of her hed. "He told you he felt much better the night he was taken so ill; and, a few moments later, fell uncon- scious at your feet." "But he had been talking wildly some time before that," said Annette, " and acting very strangely. I had thought of calling you, but feared to excite him." "And has he not been talking and acting very strangely for some time past?" exclaimed Elizabeth. "The other evening, after you had left the room, he sighed so heavily and seemed so unhappy over his books, that I thought his farm accounts must be in disorder, and offered my assistance in going over them; but he told me that it was his private ledger that would not bear inspection. Now, my dear, he incidentally mentioned a few days after, that he had never kept one in his life. Then," she continued, turning to Herbert, " last night, when Annette bade him good-night, he started up and took her candle to light it; but, instead of doing so, he led her the whole length of the hall in the dark, and then, placing the candlestick upon the table, left her to grope her way upstairs by herself." The blood rushed in torrents to Annette's face at this unlooked- for revelation, as she had supposed Elizabeth to be in ignorance as to Walter's "good-night," and she said, hastily: "I do not think he could find the lighters." "He did-not look for them," insisted Elizabeth. "The box was hanging beside the mantel. 6h, I am quite sure that his brain is turned! It is frightful to think of him wandering in a half-crazed condition about the world, with no one to look after him. He may walk overboard from the steam-boat! be run over by the stage-coach! be knocked down upon the high- way! robbed! murdered!"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE."      259 "Oh, pray, be quiet!" exclaimed Annette. "Of what use is it to recount all the accidents that may happen to him. Does not trouble come fast enough without running to meet it half- way?" "Well, well," said Elizabeth, as she turned to leave the room, "when you have lived as long as I have, you will alwys be prepared for the worst; for things rarely turn out better than you expect." "The idea of Walter -I mean Mr. Westhrooke -- being out of his mind!" exclaimed Annette, after she had gone. "He certainly seemed quite himself when we parted last evening," said Herbert, finding-Tfor the first time since his entrance into the room-an opportunity to put in a word, " and the note I received from him this morning, bears no trace of a madman. ' "Did he write to you before he left?" exclaimed Annette, eagerly. "Oh! won't you let me see the note, Mr. Wellesley? May I not just glance over it-?" "I am afraid not," replied Herbert, remembering, in some confusion, the ambiguous style in which it was written. "It was a simple business note in regard to an agreement we had made together, and I do not think he would like me to show it to any one." "Of course, then, I must not ask to see it," replied Annette; "but can you not tell me just what he said about going away?" "He told me to address his letters to New York," replied Herbert, "but are .you really ignorant as to the cause of his departure, Miss Purden?" and he looked searchingly at her. "What should I know of it," replied Annette, reddening, "when I tell you he never even mentioned that he was going."  "Sometimes we divine things that we are not told," said Herbert, quietly.  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC8179-00000128"/> 260        ANNETTE; OR, "My power of divination is limited," replied Annette; "perhaps you will give me the benefit of yours." "Perhaps I could, if I chose," replied Herbert, with a smile, "and you might find that it coincided with your own opinion on the subject. Shall we take a walk?" he continued, noti- cing -that she had her hat and shawl on. Annette assented, and they went out into the garden together. "Are you fond of flowers?" inquired Annette, as they walked along, (" let me pluck you some of these late roses;" and, turning aside from the path, she busied herself among the rose-bushes. "Here," she said, returning and filling his hands with her spoils. "These are my choicest darlings; take them home with you." "You are very kind," said Herbert, "to rob yourself of your pets, on my account; I will take them to my mother who is as fond of them as you are yourself." "Is she?" said Annette, " then you have not half enough. Wait here a moment, whilst I fetch a basket, and then you will be able to carry them more conveniently." She was gone and back in a moment, and then Herbert held back the high bushes, whilst she filled a small basket with the fairest flowers. "That will do," he said at last, "the basket is full to over- flowing. Now," he added, as she stood upright,!" if you wish to make your gift doubly acceptable, come with me to my mother and present it yourself. We do not live very far from here," he continued, as she stood silently considering his proposition, "and my mother is so anxious to make your ac- quaintance. Won't you come?" he added, persuasively. "I will see what Miss Mordaunt says about it," replied An- nette, moving slowly towards the house. "She may want me at home this morning."    THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        26'1 But Elizabeth wanted--no one. She was too much over- whelmed by her dreary prognostications in regard to Walter, to pay attention to anything else.        - '"Go, my dear," she said, in reply to Annette, "and be happy if you can. It is natural to youth to shake off sorrow; but I should have thought you would have missed him!"  "You speak as if he were dead!" exclaimed Annette,- with -a sharp tone of pain in her voice. "Why do you make such an ado about h's going to New York? He went of his own accord, and will probably return in a few days, at the utmost, why then should I be sorrowful?" Elizabeth answered only by a heavy sigh and a mournful shake of the head, and Annette turning from her, hastily left the room, lest she should become infected with her lugubriousness. "There is dear old Rodger," said she to Herbert, as they passed down the walk together, pointing to a field near the house where the horse was disporting himself. "He does not seem any the worse for his run yesterday; but I thought he deserved a holiday, for saving his master's life." "He behaved very well, certainly," replied Herbert, "which is more than I can say for my own horse. I was never so an- noyed in my life, as when he doubled himself up and rolled over, just at the time that it was most necessary for him to put his best, foot foremost. He had a narrow escape from going headlong into the quarry, and I do not think I should have mourned his loss had he done so." "I am very glad it happened as it did," said Annette-a soft dreamy look coming into her eyes at the recollection of Wal- ter's words when she first recovered her consciousness. Herbert gave her another searching look. She was pleased to think that hers had been the hand that saved Walter's life: there was no doubt of that.; and a pang shot through his heart  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC8179-00000129"/> 262         AN'NETTE; OR, at the thought that perhaps Walter absent would be a more formidable rival than Walter present! Certain it was that she had never before seemed so interested in him. "When do you think Mr. Westhrooke will return?" he asked carelessly, endeavoring to ascertain if she really knew nothing about his movements. "He has not taken much baggage with him," replied; An- nette, "so I presume his stay is to be short. Miss Mordaunt does not expect ever to see him again, I believe; but I do not think he will remain away more than a week." A pretty, conscious smile played over her face as she spoke  the last words, born of the hope that he'would be unable to remain longer away from her; but Herbert felt vexed at it, although he knew not why, and said, quickly: "He said in my note that he expected to be gone some time. It is very easy to send for his baggage, you know, when he has determined, upon his destination. He is a restless, roving fellow; it is well, as he says of himself, that he is not a marry- ing man; for his wife would have a hard lot, should she try to follow him up." "I have understood that he was always very domestic in his habits," said Annette; " he has been from home but once since I came to?  to live. Shall we walk a little faster? the air is keen to-day." Annette shivered as she spoke; but not from cold, for Her- bert's words were keener than a wintry blast. Walter had said that he was not a marrying man; and at the same time had wooed her love in everything but actual words. These he had never spoken, to be sure, but she had felt every day that they must come soon; and now, he was gone, without a sign! gone, perhaps to be rid of her, as he did not wish to marry, and perceived he had won her affections.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       263. Herbert's conscience smote him as he saw the effect of his words on his companion. "Let me wrap your shawl closer around you," he said; " we have only a few steps further to go, and there is my mother, awaiting us at the hall-door." "How are you, my dear? ' said gentle Mrs. Wellesley, com- ing to the gate to meet them, and taking Annette's hand in hers. "Have you come to see an old .lady, without waiting for her to call on you? That is very kind, and we must be- very good to you, in return. Come in," she added, as they reached the house; " and, Herbert, go and find your father and tell him that Miss Purden is here and that I am going to keep her to dinner. Now, no remonstrance!" she continued, with a sweet smile. "You have taken a long walk, and must rest- before you return. So do as you are bid, and take off your things." % }   &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC8179-00000130"/> 264        ANNETTE; OK, CHAPTER XXX. A NEW LOVER. ESPITE her unhappiness in regard to Walter, Annette passed a very pleasant day with the Wellesleys. It was an entirely new sensation to be made so much of, and Mrs. Wellesley having adopted her into her motherly heart, petted and cooed over her like a dove over its young. "Now, my dear," she said, as she bade Annette good-bye, "that you see how easy it is to come here, and how very glad we are to see you, will you not come whenever you can? I have so much to show you that you have not seen. There is the dairy, and there are the, birds, and the chickens, and the flowers. You must ride over, next time, and then you will not be fatigued." "Yes, you really must come again very soon," said Mr. Wel- lesley. "We will show you farming conducted on an entirely new scale. Mrs. Wellesley is at the head of everything, and the preservation of life is her hobby. The best in the garden goes to feed the pigs, chickens, etc." "It makes them nice and fat," said Mrs. Wellesley, compla- cently. "Which would pay, in the end, if they made us 'nice and fat' " said Mr. Wellesley; " but, bless your heart, Miss Purden, we are not allowed to kill them; that is considered inhumanity!" "I get so much attached: to them, dear," said Mrs. Welles- ley,!" that I cannot bear to think of their being killed!"  Then the dairy is beautiful to look at," continued Mr. Wellesley; " never a pan out of place, because there is no use for them; there being no cream to make butter with, owing to   THE CHRONICLES OF BE'LLEVUE.       265 this philanthropic woman, who gives all the milk she can spare- to the little dirty wretches that live in the neighborhood. Milk is not over-plenty, at any rate, under this system of farming," he continued; " for we are not allowed to separate the calves from their mammas, until they are quite grown up." "The mothers cry so, my dear," said Mrs. Wellesley, apolo- getically, "that I really cannot bear it." "Sometimes I am inclined to grumble a little, " continued Mr. Wellesley, "when I find all the money going out and nothing coming in; but a walk over the farm with Mrs. Wellesley, and a vivid demonstration from her of how perfectly happy and comfortable everything is, soon restores my equanimity, and convinces me that hers is the true principle of farming." During Annette's absence, Elizabeth had a visitor. It was nd other than the Rev. Archibald Stone, who thought it about time that he became better acquainted with the young disciple living under her roof. Archibald had a keen eye for the main chance, and a bril- liant idea had entered his head, some evenings before, as he sat in his study, apparently writing a sermon, actually thinking of his son's future. This young gentleman was unfortunately minus even the small amount of brains that is necessary to ensure a livelihood, when a man is started with a moderate income, a nominal pro- fession, and the energetic support of an influential father. His father had designed him for the ministry, but the pro- gress he had made in his studies for the- last few years was so small as to cause his father great concern, and a fear lest he should grow gray-headed before his studies were completed.  W He was weak yet obstinate in character, and, whilst easily  managed by an adept in the art, he was very hard to move by another. 23  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC8179-00000131"/> 266.        ANNF TTE; OR, "Some sharper will get hold of him," thought his father, "as soon as he gets his money, and he-will be penniless before a year has passed over his head." What was to be done under the circumstances? Why, place him in good hands, to be sure; and who so capable of caring for a man's welfare as a clever wife? This, then, was the idea that occurred to him, and he per- ceived the necessity of immediately marrying his son; and, cast- ing about for a suitable person, in his 1" mind's eye " he beheld Annette. He had quietly observed her for some time, and knew her to be clever; whilst his son had, time after time, expressed the most unbounded admiration for her. If she had a little prop- erty of her own, nothing could be better; and it was for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not this was so, that Mr. Stone honored Elizabeth with a call. "And you say that at the age of twenty-one she has entire control of the money left her by her father," said the Rev. Archibald, after the preliminaries had been gone through, and he had adroitly turned the conversation into the desired channel. "A dangerous position for a young girl, madame, a dangerous position! Alone! unguided! unprotected!- what is to prevent her falling a victim to some unprincipled scamp, who will marry her for her money? It is a sad case, very!" and he crossed his smooth, white hands, and heaved a sigh of such magnitude that it spoke volumes of Christian anxiety over the ultimate fate of this innocent lamb! "It gives me a great deal of uneasiness," said Elizabeth, "to think of what may happen to her after I am gone!" "And your days may be even now drawing to a close!" said Archibald, cheerfully. "Oh, my dear madame, think of this child's future before it is too late!"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       267 "What ,can I do?" asked Elizabeth, in concern. "She has no relatives in this country to whom I could consign her, in case of my death. " "Then why not select her a legal guardian, madame?" ex- claimed the worthy pastor: " one who will have a right to care for her earthly, as well as her spiritual, welfare? Madame, why not see her well married at once, and relieve yourself of anxiety?" "I have thought of that," said Elizabeth; "but I know of no one suitable to her. I was in hopes that Mr. Wellesley was going to marry-her; but she told me that I was mistaken in thinking that he had ever cared for her, and my brother tells me that he is engaged to a young lady in New York- "-- "Do not, for a moment, madame, entertain the idea of throwing that poor child into the arms of a man like Herbert Wellesley " exclaimed Mr. Stone, adding, in a solemn tone, "Were you aware, madame, that he has a tendency towards ROME!" Elizabeth looked inexpressibly shocked at this revelation, and hastened to disclaim any previous knowledge of the lament- able fact. "I knew," she said, "that he was not one of our flock; but I never imagined he had strayed so'far from the straight path! Poor young man!" "Has he been much with Miss Purden?" inquired Mr. Stone. "Yes; he has been here constantly," said Elizabeth, looking very much distressed. "Annette seemed to enjoy his society, and I saw no harm in it, then." "But now," said Archibald, impressively, " now, when you know all about him, you will, of course, not see so much of him                           . , "Of course not!" said Elizabeth, emphatically. -  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC8179-00000132"/> 268        ANNETTE; OR,. "Miss Mordaunt!" said he, again washing his hands, "I feel for you in your trying position! I would help you, my sister, - if I knew how. Stay! an idea has dawned upon me! It came like a meteoric flash - almost, as one might say, an inspira- tion! Madame, your young charge shall marry my son Joseph! Nay, do not thank me," he continued, as Elizabeth seemed inclined to speak. "I sacrifice him willingly in so good a cause! If it is the Lord's will that the poor child should be thus saved the trials and temptations of this wicked world, so let it be. Abraham would have given Isaac; let me not place myself above the Patriarchs!" "But," said Elizabeth, " you must remember that I have no legal right over the young lady or her property, and she is very determined in some things. Happy as it would make me to see her your son's wife, I cannot influence her one way or the other. She will decide for herself." "Without doubt, madame," exclaimed Mr. Stone, looking the picture of injured innocence; " did you suppose for a mo- ment that I wished you to force the young lady's inclinations? If she is not alive to the advantages of having a man like my son for her husband, I would be the last person to encourage him in throwing himself away upon her. My son, madame, is eminently calculated to produce an impression everywhere he may go. Manly and prepossessing in appearance; of superior abilities, with no vices; but I will send Joseph to speak for himself; " saying which, he rose from his seat and took his leave, stumbling over Annette and Herbert at the hall door. "Rather late for you to be out, my dear, eh?" he said to Annette, a  bland smile playing around his thick, white lips. "Better keep in-doors after sun-down-it is much safer; " and he patted her on the back paternally, whilst he sternly frowned down the wicked wolf that was prowling after this tender lamb.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       - 269, "My dear," said Elizabeth to Annette a few days after this, on her return from a walk with Herbert Wellesley, "I am very sorry you were out this afternoon. Mr. Joseph Stone was here to see you, and it is the second time he has been here this week." "I am very glad that I was not at home!" replied Annette. "I do not know any one that I dislike so much as Joseph Stone!" "I am sorry for that," said Elizabeth; for he seemed so anxious to see you that I invited him to dine with us to- morow." "Oh, dear!" groaned Annette, " is he coming?" "He said it would give him much pleasure," s id Elizabeth. "I wish I could say it was mutual," said Annette; " but he is really the greatest bore that I ever had the misfortune to meet!" "My dear, do not be so hard on the young man," said Eliz- abeth., "He is very worthy, and his father says very intelli- gent; probably it is-his bashfulness that prevents him from conversing freely with you. You must exert yourself and draw him out." "It will be 'fishing for diamonds in a mud-puddle!' " said Annette, "but I will do my best."  Accordingly, the next day Annette arrayed herself in her most becoming garments, and entered the parlor prepared to "sound"Mr. Joseph Stone, and see if, perchance, she were "entertaining an angel, unawares." Joseph arose, with his most awkward bow, and stood until  politely requested to re-seat himself. This he did so precipi- tately, that the chair slipped from under him, and he came to the ground with his usual grace.           -  Scrambling to his feet again, very hot and red, he discerned 23                        :-  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC8179-00000133"/> 270        ANNETTE; OR,- the faintest shadow of a smile hovering around Annette's lips; but it was enough to complete his discomfiture, and he retired to the sofa, where he remained until dinner was announced, answering in monosyllables the questions put to him, and seem- ing to be suffering from an unusual complement of hands and feet; for, everywhere he put them, they seemed to be in the way. Things were not much better at the table. He first dropped his napkin, then, stooping for it, capsized the soup-plate into his lap! The soup was boiling hot, and his agony must have been intense; but he bore it like a Spartan, and gave no sign. Indeed, I think the laughing eyes that looked out from Annette's demure face were to him the more trying ordeal of the two. "Miss Purden will show you over the grounds, Mr. Joseph," said Elizabeth, as they came out of the dining-room. "Get your hat, Annette, Mr. Joseph no doubt will like to take a walk." "Oh, won't you go with us?" whispered Annette piteously to Elizabeth, as she passed her to go up stairs. "I have some private matters to attend to," continued Eliz- abeth aloud, without paying any attention to Annette's whis- pered request, "'but I will not excuse myself; for I know you young people will get along better without than with me." Saying which, she disappeared up the stairs, without giving Annette time for further entreaty. "Fidele!" called Annette--determined to have another companion, even if it were only a dog. Fidele came scamper- ing along the gravel-walk at the summons; but alas! he was taken with a sudden desire to feed on Joseph's heels, and flying furiously at him, seized him by the pantaloons, which he shook vigorously. Now, I know of no more embarrassing position than that of   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       27I a young lover, fiercely attacked by a little dog belonging to the lady of his affections. If he put his hand down to- drive off the animal, ten to one he is bitten; he cannot swear in the beloved one's presence; neither can he kick the little wretch out of the way, without forever ruining himself in her eyes; there is nothing, therefore, to be done but to stand still, as Joseph did, with an imbecile smile upon your countenance. Annette did her best to soothe her pet, but all her efforts were useless; and at length she was obliged to pick the dog up in her arms and carry him. "He is very playful," said Joseph, trying to conceal his dis- comfiture. "He is very naughty," said Annette, " and shall be whipped and put to bed, if he does not behave better in future." On they walked in silence. Up one walk, down another; at regular intervals, Annette said': "This is a rose-bush," or a " myrtle," or a " dwarf; " as it might happen to be, and Joseph said: "Ah, indeed!"  "I wonder if there is any subject on which he can talk," thought Annette, and- "I wish I could think of something to say," thought Joseph. "It is a very fine day," said Joseph, at length making an effort, " except that, I think, we shall have rain." "Why do you think so?" inquired Annette, looking up into the cloudless sky. "The wind seems to be in the proper quarter, and I see no sign of bad weather." "I don't know," said Joseph, feebly; "only we do have so much rain, you know." "I have not noticed the fact," said Annette. "Have we had more than usual this year? Let me see; when did it rain last?" ' f "Yesterday! ' said Joseph, desperately. "Oh, no," said Annette, " you are mistaken. I was, out all  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC8179-00000134"/> 272        ANNETTE; OR; day yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that! Why, Mr. Stone, I do not think it has -rained for two weeks." "No!" said Joseph, looking very much surprised. "I thought it had been raining every day."  "Are you quite sure," said Annette, with a slight curl of her upper lip, " that you know when it is raining?" Turning her head rapidly, one of Annette's stray curls caught upon the button of her cloak, and called forth from her an ex- clamation of pain. "Let me help you!" exclaimed Joseph, burning to blot out all past mischances by some deed of glory, and bending all his energies towards the release of the refractory curl. But the more he struggled with it, the tighter it wound itself around the button, whilst the unusual juxta-position of his hand and Annette's smooth blooming cheek so embarrassed him, that his fingers trembled and twitched nervously, tangling the hair worse than before. "Oh!" shrieked Annette, as he at last endeavored to wrench it from the button, and instinctively she raised her hands, dog and all, towards her head. In a moment another piercing "Oh!" rent the air, as Fidele met his little ivory teeth through Joseph's fore-finger. "Suppose we go into the house?" said Annette. "I think I shall go home," said poor Joseph. "Sal Volatile! Valerian! cold water! anything to restore myshattered nerves!" exclaimed Annette, throwing herself upon the sofa in Elizabeth's room. "OO Miss Mordaunt, I am dying of mental exhaustion!" "I will not go again, I tell you!" exclaimed Joseph, as he stormed up and down his father's study. "She is a great deal cleverer than I am, and she does nothing but make fun of me." "Marry her, my boy," said his father, complacently, " and thenl you may turn the tables."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELtEVUE.        273 CHAPTER XXXI. A REPULSE. oT N OTWITHSTANDING his father's good advice, it was N1 N some days before Joseph could make up his mind to call again upon Annette. He was, like most awkward persons, peculiarly sensitive to ridicule, and- he not only immediately discerned Annette's dis- position to amuse herself at his expense, but was painfully aware how much food. for amusement he constantly gave her. Among his own set, where, as his father's son, he was out- wardly respected and made much of, he could hold his own manfully, and felt neither awkward nor abashed; but no sooner did he come into Annette's presence than all his self-confidence forsook him, and he could do nothing but wish himself away again. Not that he did not admire her, for he thought her superior in- every respect to all other women; but a sense of incongruity haunted him forever, and he felt as if they were constantly re- hearsing "'Beauty and the Beast." The idea of ever marrying her, became absolutely appalling. To sit day after day opposite that beautiful face, and feel how plain his must look beside it-to have to spend hours tete A tete with Annette, during which he could find nothing to say--to be forever on the watch for that furtive smile, as he was now during his brief visits; was this a life to be sought or envied? In vain his father tried to convince him that, once married to her, all would go well. It seemed impossible that he could . ever become accustomed to Annette's daily presence in his  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC8179-00000135"/>  home, or cease to be afraid of her ridicule, whilst the notion of ever treating her familiarly was too absurd to be entertained for a moment; his father, therefore, was obliged to content himself for the present with insisting upon his constantly visit- ing her, and leaving the rest for time and restored self-conceit to accomplish. Annette was at first inclined to receive his advances ungra- ciously, and unceremoniously dismiss him-when she was bored; but finding that for some unknown reason Elizabeth encouraged his visits, she put a restraint upon herself, and endeavored to conceal how much they annoyed her. She never took any pains to make herself agreeable, how- ever, and indeed rarely took the trouble to talk to him, not- withstanding he followed her about like a faithful scotch-terrier, ready to accept any trifling attention she might pay him, but never daring to solicit any. However, he was not always thus humble. Sometimes, after an afternoon passed in her society, during which she had played upon him with her wit, never dreaming that he hid beneath his uncouth exterior a very sensitive heart, he would return home in a towering rage, and vow, for the twentieth time, that he would have nothing more to do with her. At such times his father waited calmly until his passion had cooled, and then patiently recapitulated the advantages to be secured by perseverance in his quest. Meanwhile, Herbert was not idle. He sought Annette's company at all times, and endeavored by constant devotion to prove to her how dear she was to him; but she was either obtuse, or did not chose to understand him; for, so far from making any progress in his suit, it seemed- to him that he each day drifted farther away from the haven where he would be. Sadly, as the winter wore away, did he confess to himself          that his case was hopeless; and to reason as to whether- he had X done well to accept Walter's sacrifice. Had it been of any use? None, that he could see; for An-   :! ftette had never been so kind to him as when Walter was with them; and since his absence she had been thoughtful and " dis- ;! trait," scarcely seeming to comprehend what he said to her. Did she love Walter, after all? Alas! if such were the case, what would she think of the man who had driven him from     - her side?                             Thus passed the time with Annette's lovers; whilst she her- self remained as cold and impassive, outwardly, as the winter' snow now covering the ground. But, inwardly!' ah! there raged a tempest! insulted pride and outraged love clamoring-  for some relief! Where was Walter? Why had he left her? these questions kept recurring all day long; and, in the stillness of the night, ; she wept hot tears to think that she could not banish from her heart one so unworthy of its love. Yet ever, in the midst of  her indignant anger, would come the fond recollection of that : first and last embrace, and a deep voice seemed to whisper:  "Such as it is, my life is yours, forever and forever!" Then a loving hope would rise within her, that he would. soon return; and, finding her still waiting for him, clasp her once more within his arms and make her his forever and forever! -I; On flew the days, however, and he did not come, neither did he send her any token of remembrance; and her heart began  to droop and faint under the pressure of this long suspense. .  During the day she bore up well, for she could drive away her mental pain by laboring with her hands; but towards evening, at that fire-light hour, before the lamps were lighted- :: .:: which had been so peculiarly Walter's and her own-she gave ' * herself up to the sadness that oppressed her.

Thus Herbert found her one cold afternoon, sitting dreamily in the fire-light, reading the past in the bright flames. He took a seat opposite to her, and endeavored to converse, but time and place influenced him also, apparently; for, after the first few common-places had been exchanged, he sank into a reverie as profound as hers had been, and read from the same book a story of his own. , Now is the time, above all others," ran his thoughts. ( If I am ever to learn the truth it must be now. That she does not love me, I know full well; but if she does love Walter, I must know it-that he may be recalled according to our agree- ment."  ' Have you heard from Mr. Westhrooke, lately?" he asked, at length. Annette started, wondering how he had read her thoughts. "I believe Miss Mordaunt had a letter from him a few days ago," she replied. "Does he speak of returning home soon?" inquired Herbert. "No," replied Annette;, "he says nothing at all about it." Herbert gazed anxiously at her as she spoke, trying hard to read her countenance, but she remained quiet and composed, although he fancied he detected a slight quiver in her voice. Again a short silence, and then he said: "Miss Purden, did we not, a long time ago--when the trees were green, and the sun was warm, and the little birds chirped in the leafy bowers over our heads - swear eternal friendship to each other?" "To be sure we did!" she replied, turning her face towards   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       2" him, with a sweet smile upon it. "Why do you mention the circumstance just now? Did you think I had forgotten it? or have you some friendly office for me to perform?" "Neither the one nor the other," replied Herbert. "I am going to act the friend towards you, and only wish to thus pre- face my remarks, so that, if I overstep the boundary-line of pru- dence and propriety, you may lay the blame on over-zealous friendship." "What an alarming introduction I " said Annette. "Have I been doing anything very dreadful, that you open the subject in this solemn manner?" "It is not of what you have done that I wish to speak," replied Herbert, " but of what you may do! Sometimes great events spring from very small beginnings. A little fissure in a rock, may, in the lapse of time, become a mighty crevasse through the constant washing of the waters, thus making two halves of what, together, formed a perfect whole. "As it is in nature, so is it in life. - Often a slight movement of the waters will make a breach between two hearts, into which rush torrents of trouble, misunderstanding, and false pride, until the breach, widening more and more, two lives, which should be one, are forced asunder, and remain unperfected to the end of time." "Is this a sermon?" said Annette, with a smile. "No; it is a tale with a moral," replied Herbert. "Ah, well, go on," said Annette; " but pray do not ask me to point out the moral, for I never find the right one." "I will not trouble you," replied Herbert, smiling. "I will explain myself as I go along. "To be brief, then: I have two friends, who, through some misunderstanding, have been parted; the little rent is made in their friendship.

"Are you very sure that they both desire it?" replied Annette. 'No, I am not quite certain on that point," replied Herbert; l and that is the reason of my visit to you this afternoon. One of these friends, whom we will call Walter Westhrooke, has left me in no doubt as to his wishes, but the other - the lady-- need I name her?*i- has not been so frank, and I am still unde- cided as to what course she would desire -me to pursue." Again silence - and again they gazed into the fire ; but this time Annette read a different tale; for she turned a page in her book of life. "Before Walter went away," continued Herbert, speaking slowly and deliberately, " he told me how deeply he loved you; but he believed that his love was not returned; he thought you loved another! Since then I have watched you closely, and- forgive me if I am too bold - I think he was mistaken in the first, and I know he was in the last! '(You are not happy, that I can see, although you disguise your feelings well." He paused to give Annette an opportunity to speak, hoping against hope that she would contradict him; but as she re- mained silent, he continued: "If I am right, and you do love him, I pray you tell me so before it is too late, and both your lives are ruined by a mis- take. One word of encouragement will bring Walter again to your side; but that word I dare not speak until you bid me." Still no answer, nor any symptom of emotion from Annette. "You will not speak it!" exclaimed Herbert. "You will suffer a little false pride to ruin your happiness forever! Ah! can you not trust me? Would I urge you to do what was not   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        279 right?? By all that I hold sacred, I promise to preserve your confidence inviolate; therefore, speak the truth without reser- vation. Is Walter Westhrooke dear to you?" Annette was sorely perplexed. She could not understand why Herbert should thus plead another's cause, or why that other, if he really loved her, should not tell her so himself. She would rather have died than avow her love before she had conclusive proof of Walter's; and yet, knowing how inti- mate the young men were, she feared to disclaim any regard for Walter, lest Herbert should discourage his suit, and he be lost to her forever!  "Have I offended you so deeply that you will give me no answer of any kind?" asked Herbert, sadly, unable to com- prehend her silence. "I promised to remember our bond of friendship," replied Annette, "no matter what you said, and therefore, I have no right to be offended; but I did not promise to answer a ques- tion, which, if asked by any one else, I should consider unwar- ranted impertinence. Has Mr. Westhrooke authorized you to offer me his hand and heart?" "No, not exactly," replied Herbert, in some confusion. "Then do you not think it would be in better taste to leave your question in abeyance until he does so, or rather until he is able to ask it for himself?" returned Annette. "But he will never do that whilst he thinks you do not love him," said Herbert. "Indeed," said Annette, sitting very upright, and looking at him with growing indignation. "He will not confess his love without the certainty of its being returned; is that what you mean? In that case, it is likely, so far as I am concerned, to remain unconfessed forever. "And you have allowed yourself to be made an instrument , %                -  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC8179-00000138"/> 280        ANNETTE; OR,  ln this unmanly effort to surprise a young girl's secret?" she continued, looking at him reproachfully. "No other testimony than that of my own ears could have made me believe it. " "You misunderstand me!" exclaimed Herbert, deeply dis- tressed at the view she had taken of his conduct. "Walter knows nothing of what I have said to you, nor will he ever hear of it. I alone am to blame, and if my interest in you has led me to say too much, I humbly ask your pardon. Let me take back the question that offended you and ask another instead. Was Walter right in his supposition that you loved another?" "I do not see that this is much less objectionable than your previous question," replied Annette, "nevertheless, I will answer it, and put an end to the subject. I do not love anyone else; neither can I imagine whom he could have thought I loved. I have but one admirer, Joseph Stone, and I scarcely think he would accuse me of loving him. Besides him, the only other gentleman that visits me is yourself, and he would scarcely suspect you." Herbert needed no further proof of what he had already suspected, that he was not the object of Annette's affection, and although he had considered himself prepared for the blow, his heart seemed to faint within him when he received it. For a few moments he remained silent, gazing wistfully at her, and longing to tell her the truth in regard to his feelings, but it would give her pain he thought; so, rising from his seat, he turned to leave the room, simply saying: "I am answered. Good-night."

"Would you not like to visit your relations in England?" "Why should I?" asked Annette, in surprise. "I do not believe they know of my existence." "The truth is," continued Elizabeth, "my position at present is a very awkward one. -This letter is from one of the trustees of my mother's estate, and in it he requests my presence in London to settle some dispute between himself and the other trustee. It is necessary, therefore, for me to go at once, and I do not see what you will do unless you go with me." "Why may I not remain where I am?" said Annette. '"Betsy and I will take care of each other." "But will you not be afraid to stay here, alone?" asked Elizabeth. "Afraid of what?" answered Annette, laughing. "Ghosts? surely there is nothing else that is likely to alarm me in this quiet neighborhood." "I do not suppose that there is any real reason why you should not remain here if you wish to," said Elizabeth; " but it is a rather unprecedented"' thing to leave a young girl like yourself alone in a country house. The time of my return will be very uncertain."   .         - "It is more remarkable that the girl should have neither father nor mother, nor home nor friends," replied Annette, her 24   &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC8179-00000139"/> 282        ANNETTE; OR,' eyes filling with tears as she spoke. "Yet such is imy, sad fate! Would I not have been obliged to live alone when :my father died, had you not given me a home? What other do I know than this? and what other friend have I but you? '" "My dear, you know that I am pleased to have you here," replied Elizabeth. "It is on your own account that I am speaking." "Ah! then let' me stay where I am," said Annette, " nor urge me to force myself, uninvited, upon the notice of those who cast my mother from among them." "You shall do as you like," said Elizabeth, kissing her. "Whilst I live, Bellevue is your home, as long as you choose to make it so. " Thus, the question was settled, and Annette was to remain, with Betsy for a companion, whilst Elizabeth transacted her business abroad. The news of Elizabeth's intended departure was a great blow to Mr. Stone, who perceived at once that if some definite en- gagement was not entered into by Annette and his son before she went, that it would never be done at all. That Annette would not listen to Joseph's suit, if left to her own judgment, he felt quite sure; he determined, therefore, that the offer of marriage should be no longer postponed. There were two things to be done, however, before this could be brought about, the first being to notify Elizabeth of the honor intended to her young guest, and the other was to coerce Joseph into offering himself at once. Not an enviable nor easy task. A note was quickly dispatched, therefore, to Elizabeth, and then Mr. Stone sent for his son. Joseph was at the stable, inquiring into the respective merits of two horses, which had been bought for him by a dealer, sub- v    .

I should like you to give me your atten- tion for a few moments on the important subject now under con- sideration." Joseph's face brightened considerably. "He is speaking of the horses," thought he; but he only said: "Go on, sir, I am listening." "I do not think I have been impatient," continued Mr. Stone; "I have allowed you ample time to make your decision, and now I should like to know what you have decided." Joseph cleared his throat, looked around the room as if searching for a lost idea, for he was never at ease with his father, and at last said, diffidently: "I think I prefer the roan, sir, if you give me the choice!" "You prefer what, sir?" exclaimed his father, with lowering brows. "The roan," stammered Joseph. - "I know you like the black filly best, and she has a great many good points, but the roan has better action!" "I have no doubt that the elegant way in which you express yourself is in vogue'at the Derby," said his father, with freei- ing politeness; " but as I am unacquainted with the language spoken, either there or at Billingsgate, forgive me if I beg you to translate your remarks into plain English; and, whilst under my roof, to treat young ladies with some respect! Of whom do you speak?" "The horses Joe Dodge brought here this morning," said Joseph, sullenly. "Ah!" said his father, " and I was speaking of Miss Annette Purden!"  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC8179-00000140"/> 284        ANNETTE; OR, "Oh," said Joseph, with a frown, as he sank back discon- tentedly into his chair. His father regarded him attentively for some moments, as he sat scowling before him, exhibiting in face, manner, and posi- tion unmistakable signs of dogged obstinacy. "Joseph," he said, at length, in a slow and deliberate man- ner, " from your childhood up to the present time you have never given me a moment's satisfaction! You were cross and ill-tempered as an infant; stupid and sullen as aboy; and now that you have arrived at man's estate, you combine all the attri- butes of your previous conditions. I am tired, sir," he con- tinued, becoming more animated, "of this continued opposi- tion to my will, and I am determined to have no more of, it! Whilst I am alive I will have respect and obedience from the members of my family, or they shall leave my house. Do you hear me, sir?" "Yes, I hear," responded Joseph. "Then take heed to what I say!" continued his father. "I have done the best I could to make a man of you, but with very little success; for everything I attempt for your advantage is frustrated by your mother's over-indulgent fondness, and your own unconquerable obstinacy. I have now one last offer to make you, and you can accept or decline as you see fit. One of two things you must do! either submit yourself to my will in regard to Miss Purden, or leave my sight forever, and run the risk of dying a beggar-for not a penny shall you ever have of mine! Take your choice, sir." "What do you want me to do now?" whined Joseph, his face working convulsively, alarm and indignation struggling for supremacy. "I am sure I go to see her almost every day." "And would continue to do that and nothing else as long as you lived, I suppose," said his father, contemptuously, "if I were not at hand to suggest something else."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       285 "No; I would not," exclaimed Joseph, passionately. c"I would never go near her again, if I could help it. Do you think it is pleasant to be made a Butt of day after day, as I am? to be asked questions by a girl far more clever than myself, which she knows I cannot answer, and to be constantly led on -to make stupid blunders for her entertainment? Ah!" he con- tinued, angrily, " sometimes when I think of how she treats me I almost hate her-! and I feel as if I would give the half of my life to be revenged upon her!" "Then marry her, my boy," said his father. "You could not find a surer means of revenge! I can think of no greater misery on earth for a clever girl than to be tied to a fool like yourself for life!" "I won't stand any more abuse from either you or her!" exclaimed Joseph, almost foaming with rage. "Tell me what you sent for me for, and let me go!" "I sent for you to give you your choice of the two courses that I have pointed out to you," replied his father. "If you desire to remain with me, I wish you to go to Bellevue at once and make Miss Purden an offer of marriage." "Alone!" exclaimed Joseph, in dismay. "' Yes!" replied his father; "yet stay," he added. "No, I will go with you." "When?" inquired Joseph. "'This afternoon," replied his father. "It is impossible!" exclaimed Joseph, starting to his feet; "I cannot do it!" "Then take the only remaining course," said his father, sternly; " and leave my house forever!" "No! no! don't send me away,!" exclaimed Joseph, sinking again into a whine; "I don't know how to earn my living; I shall starve to death!"  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC8179-00000141"/> 286        ANNETTE; OR,- That is your concern not mine," said his father, contempt- uously. "You have your choice to go or stay; once more, will you comply with my wishes?" Joseph shifted from one foot to the other, and looked on the ground in silence for some moments, whilst an inward struggle went on between his inborn obstinacy and his personal interest. Personal interest gained the day, and he muttered, sulkily: "I suppose I must, if I cannot help myself." "You can go now," said his father, pointing to the door, out of which he slouched like a whipped hound. The afternoon arrived all too soon for poor Joseph; and at the appointed time his father appeared before him like an un- relenting fate. As they entered the hall at Bellevue, his knees knocked to- gether with alarm, and he was forced to cling to his father's arm for support. "Don't go in just yet!" he implored. "Wait a moment until I have collected myself!" Mr. Stone paused upon the threshold of the parlor-door, but seeing the room empty, continued on his way, leading the agitated Joseph, who soon recovered his equanimity on finding that there was no one in the room. A footfall on the stairs, however, brought on another nervous spasm, and his father gazed hopelessly at him as he shook and shivered like one with the ague. The footfall came nearer, and the Rev. Archibald lost his temper entirely. "There are times," he said fiercely to Joseph, as he seized him by the shoulder and pushed him into a chair, "when I would like to throttle you, and this is one of them! Stop this nonsense, at once, and act like a man!" '"I don't feel like a man!" whimpered Joseph.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        287 ,' Good-morning," said Annette's sweet voice, as she entered the room, all unconscious of the trouble she was causing. "Miss Mordaunt is very busy this morning, and has sent me to present her excuses." "She could not have found a fairer substitute," said Archi- bald, with a gracious smile. "Joseph, I know, will not quarrel with her; eh, Joseph?" "I don't want to quarrel with any one!" said Joseph, stuttering frightfully. "No," said his father, giving him a look decidedly at vari- ance with his gentle tone, "my boy is very sweet-tempered, Miss Purden; he never quarrels." "That is a very good trait," said Annette. "I wish I could say as much for myself, but I am very much disposed to lose my temper when I am tried, and cannot resist speaking my mind sometimes, when I know it will cause trouble." "Ah, I cannot believe thatj" said Archibald. "Your sweet face belies your words, Miss Annette; I do not think Lou could say anything that was not sweet and kind."   j '"Oh, yes; she can!" exclaimed Joseph.  "ShB can say horrible things when she choses! Faces don't always tell the truth!"  A burst of merriment from Annette, and an exasperated look from his father, convinced Joseph that he had better have held his peace, so he relapsed into silence. ' What is this sad news that I hear concerning Miss Mor- daunt?" inquired Mr. Stone, as soon as Annette had ceased laughing. "Is it really true that we are going to lose her?  "Yes," replied Annette. "She is really going away, but I trust not for very long." "Will you not be very lonely?" said Archibald, sympatheti- cally.  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC8179-00000142"/> 288        ANNETTE; OR, "I must get used to that," replied Annette, " for it is prob- able that most of my life will be passed alone." "Oh, no," said Archibald, deprecatingly, "that is impos- sible; one as charming as yourself will never be allowed to pass her life alone. You will marry, Miss Annette. "I do not think that is likely," replied Annette, coloring. "And why not?" asked Archibald. "Surely you have not so poor an opinion of mankind as to doubt that any man would be proud to call you his? I know of one who would consider himself the happiest fellow in the world, under such delightful circumstances. Eh, Joseph?" Joseph, thus appealed to, moved uneasily in his seat-- but deemed it best to hold his peace. "It may be as you say," replied Annette, calmly, "but were I to marry, Mr. Stone, I would not be content with simply ' the outward and visible sign of a man ' I should require some 'inward and spiritual grace.' " "Of course, of course," said Archibald, smoothing his white hands, and endeavoring to rally from this very pointed obser- vation. "You are in the right, Miss Annette," he continued, "and I am glad you take so sensible a view of matrimony. Believe me, we cannot be too careful in our selection of a partner for life. If your partner in the dance does not suit you, you comfort yourself with the reflection that it will not be very long, and at its conclusion, bow gracefully, take your leave, and select another who pleases you better. But in the dance of life it is not so; this is very long, and in it there is no change of partners." Archibald sighed; Annette sighed; Joseph groaned. "It is on this all-important subject that I have come hither to-day to speak with you," continued Archibald, impressively. "Pleasant as it is, my dear young lady, to live in this delight-   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        289 ful spot, surrounded by kind friends, you must think of the future. Remember, this is Walter Westhrooke's house, and should any accident befall his sister, it could no longer afford you protection. Remember, also, that now, whilst the bloom of youth is still upon your cheek, is the time to make your choice; for when ' the eye hath lost its brightness, and the hair its sunny hue,' lovers take flight, like the birds in the winter season; and those who once counted them by scores, find themselves alone, with only the memory of the 'good times that were.' " "If men select partners for their ' blobm ' and their ' eyes,' and their ' sunny hair,' " replied Annette, "would it not be well for them to marry dolls, who could be moulded according to their wishes, and would not feel the hand of time?" "This is frivolity!" said Archibald, solemnly. "I am sorry to see it in you, extremely sorry!" and he bent upon her a look of Christian sorrow, under which she felt quite abashed. "It is my desire, Miss Purden," continued Archibald, after a slight pause, " to see my son established in life, before I go hence, and am no more seen! .. He is a good youth, and an affectionate one, and will make a loving husband, which we both agree is the main thing in married life., In his appear- ance, Miss Annette, my boy may not excel, but you have just said that the outward shell is of no account in comparison with the kernel it contains; therefore, I am emboldened to tell you that he has long loved you in secret, and asks no more of a kind fate, than to call you his wife! Am I correct, Joseph?" he continued, turning a threatening look upon his son. "Oh, yes," stammered Joseph, "that's it! Call you his wife!' wife! you know!

"It is father! that is, I!" exclaimed Joseph, nervously; "that is, we both wish it!" "Ah!" said Annette, "you are very good, but it is impos- sible for me to marry you both!" "Oh, I don't mean that!" said Joseph; " of course it is I that want to--that is, father, that wants me to want to-- why don't you help me out?" he exclaimed, suddenly turning upon his father like an animal at bay. Archibald's fingers tingled to give his son a good shaking, but restraining his feelings, he said, sweetly: "Forgive my poor boy's confusion, Miss Annette; his love for you has put his wits astray. Give him but a word of en- couragement, put him out of suspense, and you will have no reason to complain of his want of words. His happiness will make him eloquent." "I do n6t know why he should be in suspense," said Annette, coolly. "Have you any reason to suppose that your offer will be accepted?" she continued, fixing her flashing eyes upon Joseph. "Have I ever led you to believe that I was attached to you?" The last sentence, uttered in a withering tone of scorn, com- pleted Joseph's misery. "No; oh, no!" he stammered out, - ' never! Don't be angry with me! I did not wish to come here to-day, but father made me. You know you did!" he continued excitedly, as his father seemed about to speak, "and I told you it was of no use!"

I never will!" said Joseph, heartily, taking her words liter- ally, and pleased to get so easily out of what appeared to him a very bad scrape. "Our business being concluded," said Annette, bowing gracefully to the gentlemen, " to the satisfaction of all parties, perhaps you will be kind enough to take your leave, as I have a great deal to attend to this morning; " and they passed out of the room as she directed, without saying a word., CHAPTER    XXXIII. UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER, NE dark, cold evening, Herbert Wellesley set out on his return home from Bellevue, where he had been passing the afternoon. Elizabeth had gone, and Annette was alone; propriety there- fore demanded that his visits should be ended at nightfall; con- sequently he was now hastening away, having overstayed his allotted time some fifteen or twenty minutes, when he 'ran l against the last thing he expected to find upon the premises- a man!!

"Have you no warmer welcome for a friend than this?" "Give me time to recover from my surprise," replied Her- bert, "and I will be as effusive as you can desire; but now I am dumb with amazement! Do you not know that your sister is absent? What are you doing here so late?" "I might ask you the same question, might I not?" replied Walter, laughing, "or have you the right now to come and go as you please? Are you married yet?" "No," said Herbert, sadly.  "I am still a bachelor, and likely to remain one for the rest of my life." "How   is that?" inquired Walter, "you have not taken a row of celibacy, I hope," "Not exactly," replied Herbert, with a smile, "but I shall yever love but one woman, Walter, and  she, unfortunately,  loes not love me." A  short silence ensued, during which they walked on towards he gate. "Is that so?"  said Walter, at last, in an agitated voice. 'Has she rejected you, Herbert? You promised to let me now, if she did, and I have never had a line from you since left." "She has not rejected me," replied Herbert, ." for the simple -ason that she has had no opportunity; I have never offered yself, Walter; for I felt it would be causing us both useless "Do you think she cares for anyone else?

"I have tried to obtain some such acknowledgment from her, but without success. You Cave not told me what brought you to? ," continued' Herbert, as they paused at the gate. "I came to bid my sister good-bye," replied Walter; " but I hear she has been gone some weeks." "Are you not coming with me? :' asked Herbert, as Walter held the gate open for him to pass through. "My mother will be pleased to have you spend the night with us." "Thank you, no," replied Walter, "I believe I cannot go With you at present." "What will you do then?" asked Herbert, jealously. ' You surely do not intend to pass the night at your own house?" "No,", replied Walter, " but I have some business with my farmer. After that is transacted it will give me pleasure to accept your offered hospitality." "All right," said Herbert, cheerfully. "I shall expect you anytime before midnight, so do not disappoint me; au revoir." Walter retraced his steps with very conflicting emotions. He had, until now, supposed that Herbert had been successful in his suit, and that if Annette were not already his wife, she would. very soon become so. With a sad yet irresistible long- ing to look once more upon her face, he had come hither in the afternoon; but, seeing Herbert, had withdrawn unperceived and was stealing away like a thief in the night, from his own threshold, when Herbert coming out suddenly ran against him. That had been but a short time before, yet how completely had his feelings changed. - Annette was still free; his rival had retired from the field; could it be that she loved him? The mere supposition- sent the blood coursing through his veins, quickened his footsteps, and decided him to put the farmer off for a more convenient season. 25        ,  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC8179-00000145"/> 294         ANNETTE; OR, Passing in through the hall-door, he hastened to the library, feeling intuitively that it was there- that he would find Annette. He paused with beating heart upon the threshold. Yes! she was there! sitting in the fire-light in that attitude of pensive thought that he remembered so well. There was the face he had craved to see so often in those weary months of absence! Ah! how often in dreams had he stood thus and gazed, tracing her familiar lineaments as in a picture! He feared to speak, he scarcely dared to breathe, lest he should wake, as he had so often done, to find the vision flown, and himself alone once more. Annette, supposing that Herbert had returned for something he had forgotten, sat awaiting his entrance; but when he did not come, she raised her eyes, and, in wonder and alarm, be- held Walter standing in the doorway. She tried to rise, but her trembling limbs refused to support her; she tried to speak, but the words died on her lips; and she remained mutely staring at him, as at an apparition. Slowly he came forward, perceiving himself observed. An. nette's eyes never left him, neither did she speak nor move. "Annette!" he said, kneeling -before her on the hearth- rug. "Liebchen! I have come back! I cannot live without you!" Annette sat upright in her chair. She gazed upon the glow- ing face before her! upon the eyes which seemed to hold her spell-bound through the force of love, such as she had never known before; and, raising her hand to her brow, she said, in a half-whisper: "What does this mean? Who is it? Am I dreaming?" "It is I, Walter Westhrooke," replied Walter. "Ah! have you forgotten my very features in this short time? Annette I! Annette! do not turn from me! I have longed and hoped or   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        295 dreamed of this meeting every single moment since we parted! Oh! my darling, my darling! give me 'one word of comfort after all I have borne for you! I have loved you so madly! so despairingly all this time, believing that you loved another! Oh! if you have a heart, take pity on me, I beseech you!" Annette answered not a word. She covered her face with her hands, and her frame shook with convulsive sobs. "Liebchen," murmured Walter, stooping his head close to hers. "Liebchen, do you love me?" His voice fell like music on her ear, his glossy hair swept her cheek, yet not a word could she utter. "Answer me, darling! ' ' he continued; " do not trifle with me, I beseech you I Have I not suffered enough already?" Still no answer. "Annette! Annette!" he cried, "why are you so cruel? Do you hate me, that you thus hide your face, whilst I am lay- ing my soul's wealth at your feet?- Dare you thrust back upon me this love that has become my life.? Do you take me for a sentimental boy, that you play with my heart thus-drawing me to your side again by the memory of your sweet and tender eyes, simply to spurn me when I come? Do you know the tem- pest that is raging in my breast, bidding me to defy this world- aye, and the, world to come! that I may hold you once more in my arms? Surely, if ' love begets love,' mine must meet with some return. Look up, Annette! I do not need words. Let me read your answer in your eyes! Look up, my darling!" he continued, in a tone of passionate entreaty, as, taking her lands in his powerful grasp, he drew them forcibly from before her face, whilst, throwing his left arm around her, he drew her head upon his breast, and raised the sweet face to his own. No need for language now.

The hours flew by, and still the lovers remained locked in each other's arms, unmindful of aught in the world save each other. The clock struck eleven. "Can it be possible that it is so late!" exclaimed Walter, starting. "That clock is my bete noir, Netta! thus it struck the hour for my departure on that unhappy night when I went into exile from love and you!" "Ah, why did you do that?" said Annette, reproachfully. "Why did you cause yourself and me such needless pain?" "Ask me no questions, now!" exclaimed Walter, passion- ately; "leave them for the future. Let this one night stand forth in my barren life, free from a trace of sorrow, that when I come to die, I may at least recall a few brief hours of pure and unalloyed happiness." "Why do you speak thus mournfully?" said Annette. "I Shall we not pass many such hours as these in the future? What can trouble us now we are together?" "I do not know!" replied Walter; " yet I am too unaccus. tomed to happiness to accept it without fears! and now, I must say good-night!" he added, as he rose to his feet, with a sigh. "Ah, my darling! I fear to leave you, lest my joy vanish with the night, and to-morrow find me as miserable as ever! Is it really true that you love me?" he continued, taking her again in his arms. "When I come to-morrow, shall I find you the same as now?" "Do you need to ask that?" inquired Annette, looking at him with a loving smile. "Do you think that, having once loved, I can ever change? If it is this fear that troubles you,   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        297    . cast it at once and forever from your heart; for, whilst I live, : I shall love none but you!"  "God bless you!" murmured Walter, as he pressed her closer to his breast, " and grant that no evil come to you through me! Good-night!" He was gone, and Annette was alone with her happiness, which seemed, at first, too wonderful to be real. Could it be true that Walter had stood upon the hearth a few moments be- fore, and poured forth passionate loving words? had he really kissed her- held her in his arms? How like a beautiful dream it all was now; and yet how real at the time. She went up to her room, and to bed as usual; but in vain did she try to sleep. Her heart was singing a sweet melody, and she must needs lie awake and listen until the dawn of day. When she did at last fall asleep, worn out by excitement, it was only to repeat the scene of the night before, with variations, in her dreams.  Vague fancies floated through her brain. The world seemed to be a vast ocean, on whose surface floated a tiny bark freighted with her own and Walter's happiness. Hand-in-hand they stood upon the shore, watching the pro- gress of the little craft, as it breasted the billows mountain- high, or floated easily in calmer waters. It had almost reached port, land was in sight! a cry of joy was on their lips! when the boat stood still! quivered for a moment, and then went down forever! In a moment nature seemed convulsed! The mountains heaved! the earth opened! Walter was torn from her side; and she began to sink down! down! like one falling from a great height.           -             '? She uttered a piercing shriek, and clutched the air wildly in the effort to save herself; then a dulcet voice fell upon her ear, saying:                           .  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC8179-00000147"/> 298         ANNETTE; OR, "Bress yer dear heart! honey, wat's yer screechen so fur? Dar's nothin gwine to hurt you while dis yer child's 'bout! Wat's de matter wid yer?" And she opened her eyes to the light of day, and to see Bet- sy's black face at her bed-side. The consciousness of her real happiness soon dispelled the terrors of her dream, and as she sprang from her bed into the glorious sunshine which flooded the room, she sang, in the full- ness of her joy: "Be happy whilst you may, For love is yours to-day!" Alas! Annette, why did you not finish the stanza? "But sorrow Cometh zwith the morrow!" CHAPTER XXXIV. "A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED." "TEN  minutes to twelve," said Herbert, in a sleepy voice, as Walter entered the room. "Just saved yourself, old fellow, I was going to bed on the stroke of midnight. I have been expecting you since eight o'clock; that farmer of yours must be a very entertaining man." "I have no doubt he is," replied Walter, smiling, "but I cannot say as I have not seen him this evening." "No!"  replied Herbert, in surprise, "why, what detained you then?  Surely you have not beep all this time wandering around your domains, like a restless ghost?" "Not exactly," replied Walter, laughing. "This is not the    night for such a ramble. The frost would have made a ghost of me long since, had I tried it." "Then, where have you been?" inquired Herbert, curiously. "I have been at Bellevue," replied Walter. "In the house?" inquired , Herbert, suddenly waking up from his sleepiness. "In the house," replied Walter. "In the library, Her- bert, and not alone, either!" "Miss Purden was with you;" said Herbert, with difficulty preserving his self-possession. "Yes; she was with me," said Walter, "and she told me what she would not tell you, that she loved me." A dead silence ensued, during which Herbert struggled with his sorrow. He thought he had only wished for her happiness; but, when it came to the point of resigning her to another, he felt how bitterly hard it was to do. "I wish you joy, Walter," he said, at length. "May you both be very happy." "Amen," said Walter, with a happy smile. "Ah! Her- bert, my boy, you are a better man than I am! I do not think I could have wished you joy, had you won her!" "Yes, you could," replied Herbert, quietly. "No man can purchase happiness by the sacrifice of the one he loves; and most of us can school ourselves to look with pleasure on the happiness of another, although we have no part in it ourselves." "You must not judge other men by yourself," said Walter, looking at him affectionately, "for there are not many like you. "It is to be hoped' not," said Herbert, with a sad smile, "if they are to be tried by such misfortunes."    . "Nonsense!" said Walter, encouragingly. "Do not be"  discouraged, man!

I was in love a dozen times before I was your age, and not a scar remains to 'tell the tale.' When you are my age, you will laugh at this little episode in your life, as a boyish folly." "Indeed?" replied Herbert, "and how will you regard your own present feelings in the future?" "Mine is a different case," replied Walter. "When a man comes to my years, he knows his own mind; and, if he loves then, it is forever; but a fellow does not know how to love the first time. Are you very sleepy?" he added, as Herbert turned to the mantel and took one of the bedroom candle- sticks in his hand. "I cannot sleep to-night, and I have so much to say to you." "No, I am not sleepy now," said Herbert, patiently putting the candlestick down again. "Wait a moment, until I put some fresh logs upon the fire, and then I will listen to you until broad daylight; if you wish it." "There are several matters on which I wish to consult you," said Walter, after Herbert had resumed his seat; "and the first is as to how I am to visit Miss Purden, without calling down upon her the anathemas of the neighborhood." "That is a thing to be seriously considered," said Herbert, gravely. "Had you not better leave? , until your sister returns?" "What? stay away from    her for days, weeks, perhaps months? My dear fellow, that is not the sort of love that I understand; no, you must think of some other plan." "Can you not limit your visits then to an hour or two a day," replied Herbert, "as I have been doing?" "I won't answer for myself," said Walter, laughing. "When I am at her side, it is difficult to persuade myself that it is ever time to go. If her character depends upon my visiting her but one hour a day, I fear it will go hard with her."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       301 "There is but one other thing to do," replied Herbert, with an effort, "' and that is to marry her at once." "And there, again, is another difficulty," replied Walter, gravely. "I cannot marry just now." "What?" exclaimed Herbert, flushing with excitement. "You have wooed her love with the knowledge that you could not marry?" "Pray do not get so excited," said Walter. "I am not quite so black as you would paint me. There is no legal reason why I should not be married to-morrow, but there is a prudential one why it should not be generally known."- "In that case, of course, you could be privately married," replied Herbert, " but I do not see of what use that would be." "It would be of this use," said Walter, excitedly, " that Annette would allow me to pay my visits after dark, and no one would be the wiser." "Yes," said Herbert, slowly; "you might do that, if you can get her to consent." "That shall be my business," replied Walter, "if you will search among your friends for some 6ne to unite us who can 'keep a secret."  "I will do my best," said Herbert, shading his eyes with his hand, and then they relapsed into silence. "Go to bed, old fellow," said Walter at length; "it is out- rageous in me to keep you sitting here because I cannot sleep. You look so tired; do go and leave me." "I think I will," said Herbert, wearily, rising as he spoke, and lighting his candle. "Good-night," said Walter, cheerfully. "Take a good night's rest and you will be alloright to-morrow." "Oh, yes; I have no doubt I shall be,'- replied Herbert.' "Good-night!" and he walked away mechanically to his room. 26-  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC8179-00000149"/> ,302        ANNETTE; OkR, Once within it, however, and the door fastened, his com- posure gave way.       - His sorrow rushed over him like a flood, and it seemed im- possible to stem the tide. Ever since he had known her, she had been the one image in his heart; and he could not tell when he had first begun to love her, so entirely had she been a part of his daily thoughts and dreams. Whilst he had been in New York he had fed upon visions of future happiness, with all the hopefulness of youthful love; and even after the first blow had been struck, he rallied again and deemed the fulfilment of his wishes not impossible; but now all hope was forever crushed. Nor was this all! for would she not soon-aye! far too soon!-be the wife of another, when to love her would be a sin? Therefore, must he drive her very image from his heart, and think of her as one that was already dead. "' hou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife!" he exclaimed, as he restlessly paced the room. "No! that I will never do! if she love Walter I could not wish her for my own! but -oh, God! I cannot help but love her I / If this be a sin, destroy me in Thy wrath! for I cannot root it from my heart!" Thus did poor Herbert pass the night, tossed about by con- flicting emotions; and the morning, which dawned so brightly for Annette, shone in upon a pale-faced man, worn and weary with the strife against the!" flesh and the devil,' who sat and gazed in silence on the grave of his lost love. It is a mistaken notion that we mnay not bury persons whilst still alive. Often and often do we perform the rites of Sepulture for a lost friend, in our hearts, whilst, to the world at large, he still " lives and moves, and has his being." Thus Herbert buried Annette in the silence of the night; and from the " dust and ashes," arose a chastened spirit which shone through his after-life like a silver cord.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        303 He fought a good fight, that night and although the morning found him wounded and bleeding on the field, yet he wore the victor's crown. The day passed heavily enough for Walter, who had been obliged to promise that he would not attempt to see Annette until Herbert could think of some arrangement by which they might meet unobserved. Herbert had made this the condition upon which he gave him his assistance in his other plan, and he was too important an ally to be lost, so Walter consented to his restriction, although with a very bad grace. Herbert constituted himself his ambassador, and rode over to Bellevue with as rabid a love- letter as a boy of sixteen could have written under like cir- cumstances. Annette was very shy at first, but as Herbert continued to speak to her in the gentle affectionate tone of an elder brother, her embarrassment wore off, and she realized how pleasant it was to have a third person to whom she could pour out all her hopes and fears, and discourse at length upon the all-absorbing theme of "first love." To conceal her love would have been impossible. It shed a radiance over all she did and said; her eyes shone with a lustre they had never before possessed, and the whole expression of her face was gentle, tender, and loving. How hard it was to sit beside her and enter cordially into her love for another, Herbert alone knew; nevertheless, he went through his task courageously, nor shrunk from a single trial.                     -   . "And what shall we do now about Walter's visits?" he said at last, as he rose to take his leave.

"What can we do?" said Annette, looking blankly at him. "We must see each other, sometimes-; and I promised Miss Mordaunt that I would receive no visitors after dark." "It is a very perplexing business," said Herbert. "Walter and yourself must arrange it between you. In the meantime, my mother will be happy to have you pass this evening with us, if agreeable to you." "How very kind," said Annette, looking at him, gratefully. "Tell your mother, if she needs any answer, that I will come with pleasure." That evening and the next, and the next, Annette passed at the Wellesleys, no other plan suggesting itself, whereby she could enjoy Walter's society. Her conscience, however, re-, proached her for making a convenience of these kind friends and turning them nightly from their ordinary sitting-room; for how could they remain with a pair of disconsolate lovers, gazing madly at each other, and answering at random all the questions addressed to them. Annette imparted her scruples to Walter at last, and told him that, distressing as it was, she could really no longer im- pose on these worthy persons' good nature. "We must think of some other plan," she said, " or we must meet less often." "There is another plan, Netta," replied Walter, "- that both Herbert and myself have thought of, but 1 have feared hitherto to mention it to you." "What is it?" said Annette; "surely anything is better than the life we are leading!"

"Darling," he continued, " it has come to this, that you must consent to give yourself to me at once, or we must part until Elizabeth returns, for I can no longer bear this trying life!

What do you say? will you send me away again, to go through all the heart-sickness from which I have just recovered?" "No, I cannot do that!" said Annette, softly, as she placed her hand in his.

BRIGHT and beautiful dawned the day on which Annette Purden and Walter Westhrooke were to be joined in holy wedlock. Many had been the discussions as to the proper time and place, but at last it was decided that Herbert should bring his mother and the clergyman to pass the morning at Belleyue; and, whilst the domestics were absent at church, the ceremony should be performed. Thus they met together on this bright Sunday, and stood staring questioningly at one another in the large parlor. "Where is the clergyman?" said Walter, at length, noticing to his surprise that Herbert had entered alone. "Where is the bride?" said Herbert, with a faint smile. One is about as necessary as the other," "Mrs. Wellesley, may I trouble you to see where Miss Pur- den is?" said Walter, turning to that lady. "We have cleared the house so completely, that there is no one left 'n it to send for her."  .   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       309 Mrs. Wellesley complied at. once with his request, and leav- ing the room sought Annette's chamber. She found the poor girl lying upon the bed with her face buried in the pillows. She stood beside her in silence for a moment, wondering if it were possible that she could be sleep- ing; but a suppressed sob from the motionless form convinced her that such was not the case; so, stooping over her, she whis- pered : "Annette, dear child, what ails you? do you not know that they are waiting for you down stairs?" "Yes, I know it," said Annette, in a choked voice; " but- I cannot, oh, I cannot go down! It is all so strange and un- natural. Every one sent out of the house, as though I were going to do something wrong. It seems to me as if I were to be buried instead of married. " "But, my dear child," said Mrs. Wellesley, "you agreed that the ceremony should be privately performed, did you not? Why, then, object to it now? Come," she added, soothingly, "get up, dear, and let me make you look nice before you go down." "I will not go down!" exclaimed Annette, starting suddenly from her recumbent position, and thereby disclosing to view a feverish and excited countenance. "Oh, send them away, Mrs. Wellesley, I beseech you! I cannot get married to-day! There is a horrible presentiment of evil hanging over me like a dark cloud!" she continued, as rising from the bed she began to pace to and fro in extreme agitation. "Annette!"exclaimed Mrs. Wellesley, "how wildly you talk, my dear. Pray calm yourself, and act rationally. . I really cannot tell Mr. Westhrooke that you have changed your mind at this late hour.

Oh, you are ail in league against me, and I have not one friend left, no, not one!" and throwing herself into a chair, she began sobbing violently. Poor Mrs. Wellesley looked at her in amazement. This was not the sort of bride she had expected to encounter, anc. she -was at a loss as to what course she should pursue. Being of a mild and gentle temperament herself, she could not understand Annette's nervous excitement, and feared lest she really did not love Walter. Perhaps, at the last moment, she had discovered that Herbert was her choice, and under these circumstances, Mrs. Wellesley certainly did not wish her to marry the wrong man. "Is this your final decision, my dear?" she said, at length, "Am I to tell Mr. Westhrooke that you decline to be married to-day?" "Yes I yes!" exclaimed Annette, " tell him anything you please! only do not ask me to go down stairs, I beseech you!" Mrs. Wellesley silently left the room in quest of Walter. She had not far to look, for he was impatiently pacing the cor- ridor, anxiously awaiting Annette's appearance. "Where is she?" he asked, as Mrs. Wellesley approached him. "She will not leave her room," said Mrs. Wellesley, looking blankly at him. "What?" exclaimed Walter, staring at her. "She absolutely refuses to be married to-day," continued Mrs. Wellesley, " and she says that we are all in league against her." Walter stood for a moment in deep thought, and then striding up the corridor he pushed open Annette's door and entered. She was still where Mrs. Wellesley had left her, sitting in a * low chair; with her face hidden in her hands.

Is this the  force of your vaunted affection, or are you trifling with my love to drive me mad? Listen for a moment to what I wish -to tell you, and then pronounce my doom. "Years ago I loved another woman, madly! passionately' yet not so truly as I now do you! but, just as my earthly bliss seemed consummated, when I had centered all my hopes in her, and lived only in the light of her eyes, she turned from me to another, changing her love as lightly as a rose sheds its leaves, and trampling my heart under foot, laughed at me for my folly." Walter paused a moment, whilst his breath came short and quick, from intense agitation. "I recovered from that blow, as you know," he continued, "but for years after I was a changed man. Faith and love seemed cold and' dead within my heart, until I first met you. How' you again taught me the long forgotten lesson, I need not stop to relate; suffice it to say that this latter lesson was better learned than the first, and that my faith in your affection for me, and my love for you, have become the loadstone of my existence. And now, Annette, I have only this to say : having aroused my dormant soul within me, and made my life once more of value, oh, beware how you cast me back into the dark abyss from which you drew me, lest I take arms against myself, and so end my misery with my life!" "Walter! Walter!" sobbed Annette, terrified by his ve- hemence, " forgive me, my darling, oh, forgive me I I will go with you now; I was mad to say that I would not. Lead the. way and I will follow, be it to the uttermost part of the-earth."n  "Let me brush your hair, dear," said Mrs. Wellesley, very much distressed at her swollen eyes and dishevelled appearance.  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC8179-00000154"/> :2        ANNETTE; OR, Annette submitted without a word to be put in order, and then submissively followed Mrs. Wellesley down the stairs. Once within the parlor, everything became vague anc indis- tinct. She was dreamily conscious that Walter ,met hear, and, putting his -arm reassuringly around her, drew her- to the extreme -end of the room, where a very pale young clergyman was await- ing her, book in hand.                            \ The service proceeded, but she heard nothing of it.  It seemed an unintelligible babble of tongues, and she was three times requested to repeat her part after the clergyman,-before she understood rightly what was required of her; even then she repeated it mechanically, and comprehended what she w~as say- ing no more than an infant.                       :  ' "I pronounce that they are man and wife! " were the first words that she heard distinctly, and then she became conscious that she was kneeling, Walter Westbrooke's wife, whilst Herbert Wellesley pronounced a blessing over her and her husband. "God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and keep you ! The Lord mercifully with His favor look upon you, and fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace; that you may so live together in this life, that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting." He spoke the words in a full, sonorous tone, as if the blessing came from the depth of his heart, which, indeed, it-did; and although his pallor was extreme, the expression of his face was calm, and even cheerful, as he assisted Annette to rise, and offered his congratulations. "Herbert," said Walter, an hour later, when he was about taking his leave, " why did you subject yourself to such a fiery ordeal ? Was there no other clergyman to be found whoecould have taken your place ?" " There were many clergymen," replied Herbert, " but none   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       -31-3 so -deeply interested in you and yours as myself; therefore% I deemed it best not to trust your secret to another." " You have acted more like a brother than a friend," replied  Walter, pressing his hand warmly. " How can I ever repay you ?"  "If I have secured her happiness, I am content," replied Herbert. "Do not ever give me reason to repent what I have done this morning, Walter. Make her peace and comfort your first thought, and I shall be amply repaid." CHAPTER XXXVI. THE PLOT THICKENS. THUS passed for our heroine that all-eventful period of a girl's life - her wedding day; -and Walter and Annette were united without, apparently, a cloud to cast its shadow upon their happiness, save that their union was still a secret. This gave Walter no uneasiness whatever; but Annette still felt troubled when she thought about Elizabeth. And now arose a difficulty which might have been foreseen. Despite Herbert's remonstrances, Walter's visits to-his bride became longer every day, nor was he as careful, as he, had hitherto been, to prevent their being known. If it had been difficult to prevent him from passing all his time with his "fiancee," it was now impossible to keep him from his wife; ~ and the only effect remonstrance had upon him, was to cause him to take up his abode at Bellevue, to avoid the importunity of his friends. Of course this was soon known, aid Annette's character 27  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC8179-00000155"/> 3I4         ANNETTE;' OR, became public property.' She had no friends but the Welles- leys, and the stories told of her by some were eagerly received by others, and passed thus, from one to another, through the entire village. The persons chiefly concerned, however, paid but little atten- tion to these reports, being too entirely absorbed in each other. The days passed like a happy dream, and they wondered greatly that they had ever been able to support life apart. They knew each other's tastes, so well, that it sometimes seemed as if they read each other's thoughts and so entirely were they in unison, that their life seemed likely to prove a long " honeymoon." Over the old walks they would go, retracing the progress of their love. Every haunt was visited, and the varied hopes and fears of each recounted to the other. The summer came again with its bright sun, and birds, and flowers; nature seeming also to accord with the happiness glowing within their breasts, and not a wish remained ungratified. "My darling!"Walter would sometimes say, "I tremble for the future. What can heaven give me more than I now have?" And Annette, nestling closely, would whisper: "An eternity of such love as we cannot even dream of! Here we must meet with trouble, pain, anxiety, separation; but there, we shall meet to part no more!" "You are too good for me!"Walter would reply. "When you talk in this manner I always become alarmed lest the angels mistake you for one of them, and carry you away!" Ah! could I but close my story here, and leave them in their happiness! Alas! it was too great to last, and so they felt when all was over! Perfect bliss is not the lot of mortals; let those, therefore, who think themselves most secure, have a care ; for sooner or later the storm will burst, and they will find their house was built upon the sand.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.         315 Even as Annette and Walter congratulated themselves upon having made port in good weather, a cloud was rising in the east destined to overshadow their lives forever. It was a balmy morning in the month of June when this cloud first made its appearance. Annette- had entered the breakfast-room at the appointed hour, but Walter was not there. She waited for some time, and then becoming impatient, called Fidele to her assistance, and left the room to find him; but he was not in his room, nor in the parlor, nor in the garden; and although she called his name repeatedly, still he did not come. "It is like a game of' hide and seek,'" she said, laughingly, as she re-entered the house from the garden. "Ah, Fideile, we have not looked in the library," and pushing the door open she gaily entered. "Ah! truant, there you are!" she exclaimed, as she first caught sight of his figure seated at his desk; but, at a second glance, she flew to his side with a cry of anguish; for Walter, although still seated in his chair, seemed to be entirely uncon- scious. His half-closed eyes were lustreless; his parted lips were colorless. His head (was drooped upon his breast, and in his hand he grasped an open letter, as though he would fain carry its secret with him to the grave. Betsy, summoned by Annette's cries, declared him to be in a fit; and with George's assistance, they laid him on the sofa, and applied such remedies as they had at hand. After some moments of horrible anxiety, he gave signs of returning life; and at last, with a deep groan, opened his eyes and looked upon them. As the tension of his muscles became less, his hand loosed its hold of the letter, and it dropped to the ground. Annette stooped to pick it up; but at the rustling of the paper, Walter looked down, and perceiving what she had, snatched it from her hand, exclaiming in great excitement:  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC8179-00000156"/> 316         ANNETTE; OR, "Give me that paper! It is not yours! Why do you touch that which does not belong to you?" "I was only stooping to pick it up for you," said Annette, gently. "I have not read a word of it; but if its contents have caused your sickness, Walter, I pray you read it to me. You know your troubles are all mine now." "What nonsense," said Walter, with a forced laugh. "Why should you suppose that a trumpery note like this should have the power to make me ill? I have often had these attacks; they are nothing; the heat of the day has probably caused this one. How you women love to scent a mystery," he continued, rising from the sofa, and walking unsteadily across the room to where the candles stood upon the table. "There, to prove to you that it is not an old love-letter that you caught me read- ing, I will burn it up before you," saying which, he lit the candle, and held the paper in the blaze until it was consumed. Annette was deeply pained, not only at his words, but at his reticence, for she felt convinced, despite his assurances to the contrary, that the contents of this letter had in reality caused his singular attack. She dared not broach the subject again, however, since he had so summarily rejected it, but tried to wait in patience until he should make up his mind to confide his trouble to her. This was not easy to do, however, especially as the miserable scrap of paper, although destroyed, seemed to be perpetually arising between her husband and herself, and obscuring their view of each other. They both thought of it continually, and tor- mented themselves with the fear lest the other knew their thoughts. Walter became gloomy and depressed; and Annette's good spirits deserted her. Living in the same house, and loving each -other-as dearly as ever, they were, nevertheless, as strangers to each other, and seemed to have missed their way in life - all through a little scrap of paper.    CHAPTER XXXVII. THE RUDE AWAKENING. Annette had made some friends during her sojourn at P  , she had also made two bitter enemies. The Stones, both father and son, could never forgive her contempt of- what shall I say? - their offer! Although Archibald was willing enough to abuse his own son, he was not at all pleased that any one else should do so, and the " milk of human kindness" had been curdled in Joseph's heart by all that he had gone through on Annette's account. Not only had he suffered from her and his father's ill-treat- ment, but some " choice spirits," boon companions of his own, and frequenters of the tavern, had in some way discovered his unlucky secret, and amused themselves immensely at his ex- pense, as they sat around the convivial board every Saturday evening. Poor Joseph, to drown his mortification and misery, drank deeply of the "wine that was red in the cup," and often re- turned to his paternal roof very much the worse for these con- vivial evenings. Of course Walter's change of residence had not escaped the eye of these " roisterers," and they rallied Joseph all the more on this unlucky issue of his courtship. Loath as I am to confess it, Archibald heard of her supposed "fall from grace" with extreme complacency. He had always known " the'girl was not to be trusted." She had never really " experienced religion." "Joseph had been 27 *  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC8179-00000157"/> 31         ANNETTE; OR, att'racted by her, at one tinme," but he' " had advised him to have nothing to do with her." These and like sentences' dropped oracularly from his mouth, like the toads and reptiles of the fairy-tale, as he visited his flock, and bemoaned this black sheep that had come among them. Annette knew nothing of this; neither did she trouble herself over what the little world of? might say of her. She had done no wrong, her conscience was clear, and she (did not even notice that the few visitors she had ever had had of late ceased to call upon her. She had lived in close retirement ever since her marriage, scarcely leaving Bellevue except to pay a rare visit to Mrs. Wellesley. She therefore heard little or nothing of the affairs of the village, and, Herbert being absent, there was no 'one to enlighten Walter. Latterly, Annette had not even been to church, Walter's pre- judices being so great against Mr. Stone, that he absolutely refused to go with her, and she could never make up her mind to leave him during those first happy days. But after the cloud arose between them  it was different, for the time often hung heavy on her hands; thus it was one bright sun- shiny Sunday that the church-bell drew her across the fields to the old church where Archibald weekly harangued   his followers. The bell had ceased its clamor when she reached the door, and the congregation were already in their seats. Elizabeth's pew was next the pastor's, directly beneath the pulpit, and it seemed to Annette that every eye was turned upon her as she made her way to it.  Overcome with embarrassment she opened the wrong door, nor discovered, until she was seated, that she was tete-a-tete with Joseph Stone, in the pastor's pew.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        319 Her first impulse was to retire; but, on second thoughts, she deemed it better to stay where she was rather than again run the gauntlet of those scores of eyes. Joseph was never obtru- sive at any time, and therefore would scarcely address her now, directly under his father's eye. So she remained in her seat, and soon recovered her equa- nimity as the service proceeded-a holy calm succeeding her troubled feelings, as she lost-herself in the prayers and psalms which followed each other in succession. "Come unto me ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," read the preacher; and the words fell upon her heart like dew upon the parched ground. But whilst Archibald was uttering these words of peace, his soul was filled with righteous indignation ; for his eye had fallen upon Annette, not only at church, from whence he had sup- posed ordinary shame would have kept her, but absolutely seated in his pew and beside his son! 'Such audacity would be incomprehensible were it not well --known that " where there is no grace, there is no shame." These thoughts pursued him as he shut himself up in his little box preparatory to electrifying his hearers -with one of his elo- quent discourses, and so overcome was he by his feelings, that the words and even the text of the sermon he had intended to preach entirely escaped his memory. He was not, however, a man to be easily discomposed, and, quite equal to the occa- sion, he hastily selected another text in accordance with his severe mood, and rising, exclaimed, in a full, sonorous voice. "Ye are of your father--the devil! and the lust of your father ye will do!" He began his discourse by a description of the arch-fiend, so vivid and exact that the congregation, felt as though they had become personally acquainted with him; after which he' pro-  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC8179-00000158"/> 320         ANNETTE;.OR, ceeded to enumerate the evil deeds he wrought through those over whom he had dominion; and when, at length, he had worked both himself and his hearers up to the proper pitch of excitement, he burst forth in the following-words: "Beloved, the enemy assumeth various pleasing shapes to tempt the soul of man to sin. I have seen him so well dis- guised that he deceived even the very elect. He saith to the vain heart of woman, ' Behold! thou art fair! The world lies before thee! All these things will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me!' and she who listeneth unto his voice  turneth her steps from the way of life, and entereth into that broad path which leadeth to destruction! Ah, the works he doth in this pleasing shape would draw tears from eyes that never wept before! Entering into her heart, he taketh to himself seven spirits worse than the first, and through her he beguileth the souls of men, wooing them to their eternal damnation! "Brethren, look to it that ye harbor none such among ye! Beware of the devil in this most tempting form, and when you see any who haven- fallen from their high estate as children of God, and regardless alike of the teachings of religion and the restraints of society, are living in open defiance of God and man,; remember that none can touch pitch without being defiled, and pass them by on the other side, for although ' among us,' such are not ' of us!'"  Long was that sermon remembered by all present, for it was an exceptional one; the Rev. Archibald having never preached against immorality before, owing to the strict observance of all conventional rules in his parish, which had made it unnecessary. Whatever their vices, this was not one of them, and their outraged feelings at Annette's and Walter's derelictions can be easily imagined.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        321 f Although Mr. Stone had carefully avoided too great person- ality, his flock felt well assured of whom he was thinking during , his discourse, and Annette herself was, perhaps, the only uncon- scious one in the church. Peaceful in her innocence, she had kept her eyes fixed upon the preacher, never dreaming of the indignation she was exciting, her heart meanwhile feeling with gentle pity for the poor lost souls of whom he spoke. At length the service came to a close, and Annette, rising from her knees, joined the throng pressing out to the porch to exchange greetings with their country neighbors; for it was the custom of those who lived at a distance to drive over to church, and, fastening their horses under a shed erected for the purpose, T remain on the grounds until afternoon service. Passing through the door, Annette turned, with a sweet smile, to greet her neighbors according to custom; but the sermon was still fresh in their minds, and they dared not return the greeting. From one familiar face to another Annette turned in bewil- derment, but averted faces and downcast eyes met her every- where. Silently they made way for her to pass, but no kindly word was spoken; no hand stretched forth to meet her own. On she went, as in a dream, with slow and faltering step, whilst the red blood mounted to her forehead at the slight thus' put upon her, until she reached the churchyard-gate, beside which Joseph Stone was standing, apparently waiting for her.  She endeavored to undo the latch, but- her trembling hands proved unequal to the effort, and hot and uncomfortable, she essayed in vain to free herself from a position that became every moment more unbearable. Joseph, who had up to this time continued to regard her with a glance of malicious triumph, now came forward, and. saying: V  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC8179-00000159"/> O-3       ' ANNETTE; OR, " Here, I'll open it for you," placed his hand over hers upon the latch, with a bold familiarity totally at variance with his ordinary manner, and opening the gate, allowed her to pass through, following her closely. Overcome by her agitation, Annette hurried on, unaware that she was not alone; but, as she entered the lane leading to Bellevue, Joseph came up suddenly beside her, and seizing her hand drew it within his arm, exclaiming: "Ah, ha! my lady! I have you at last, have I? This moment compensates me for all your mocking tongue has made me suffer. I fancy the tables are turned to-day, and you know how it feels to be scorned i " Annette stood still in hot indignation. To what depth had she fallen that this wretch dared address her thus. "Release me, sir! " she said, as soon as she could collect herself sufficiently to speak. '" I think you forget yourself! " "Not I!" replied Joseph, with undisguised triumph. "I remember myself quite well, and I also remember who you are ! No airs,, now! for I won't put up-with them, I can tell you! If you act sensibly, we shall get along very well together; if not-I have old grudges to pay off!  I don't bear any malice now, however, so let's kiss and make up! " and, suiting the action to the word, he threw his arms around her, and stooped his face to hers. "Stand back! " exclaimed Annette, passionately, releasing herself from  his grasp by an agile spring. "How dare you touch me! Have I not told you repeatedly that were you the only man in the world, I would not marry you ? Coward that you are to molest an unprotected girl ! " "Ha, ha!" laughed Joseph, "this is a    very good joke! You say you will not marry me / Do you suppose I am such a fool as to want to marry you, now? By Jove, no ! Joseph   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.  323   Stone looks somewhat higher than Walter Westbrooke's mis- tress !" A wail of bitter misery burst from Annette's lips at these- brutal words. The mystery was now explained. This was what the country folk considered her ! This was the light in which she stood before the world! Everything swam before her eyes, and she staggered back against the fence, clutching the rail to prevent herself from falling. ,' There is no use in making a scene," continued Joseph, with a sneer. "You see I know your secret, and the only thing left for you to do is to treat me civilly, and then I will see what I can do for you., Come, let us wipe out old scores," and he again attempted to embrace her. -" Stand back ! "  exclaimed Annette, once more; but Joseph only laughed at her indignation, and pressed her closely in his arms. " Walter! Walter! " shrieked Annette, frantically. " Oh ! my darling, where are you ? " " Here! I am coming! " exclaimed a voice at some little distance, followed instantly by'the crashing of the underbrush on the other side of the fence; and scarcely had Joseph made his escape good in the opposite direction, ere Walter broke through the tall hedge, and stood beside Annette. "What is it, my darling?"  he exclaimed, in alarm, as he glanced at her ashen face. "Has any one been frightening you? Let me but know who has distressed my wife, and the villain shall pay dearly for it! " " Take me home ! " moaned Annette, clinging to him. "Oh! take me home ! " "So I will, dearest," said, Walter, soothingly, and putting his arm around her to support her feeble steps. " We will go home first, and then you will tell me what'has happened." &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC8179-00000160"/> 324        ANNETTE; OR, But it was not until late in the evening that Annette was sufficiently recovered to give any explanation of her agitation; and even then she refused to tell the particulars of her inter- view with Joseph, only relating his father's sermon, and her treatment at the hands of the villagers. "The cowardly wretch!" exclaimed Walter, at the close of the narrative, ' to couch an insult in holy words, hiding meanwhile behind his pulpit, whence he can uncontradicted scatter broadcast his scandalous insinuations! I feel tempted to teach him that I am no respecter of the cloth,' when the wearer is a hypocrite and slanderer, by giving him a sound thrashing I " "No! no!" said Annette, quickly, " you must not blame him too severely, Walter! Remember he may not have intended to be thus interpreted; and, after all, the fault is in a great measure our own. Oh! darling!" she continued, beseech- ingly, "must this secrecy be much longer maintained? It is breaking my heart!" For a few moments Walter made no answer. He seemed to be struggling against some overpowering emotion, for Annette could hear the rapid pulsation of his heart, as her head rested upon his breast. "Annette," he said at length, " have you forgotten all you said to me once on this subject? how you told me the opinion of the world was of no consequence to you? Am I any less worthy of such love than I was then, or why has my darling thus changed?" "You are more worthy now than ever," replied Annette, twining her arms affectionately around his neck; " but, darling, it is as much for you as for myself that I would have our mar- riage published. Think how your sister would feel should she accidentally hear the village scandal."

"Wait until Elizabeth returns, and I will tell her everything, She will bring with her information of vital importance, and she must soon be at home again." "It shall be as you say," said Annette, with a sigh; " but, Walter, waiting is very hard." "Separation would be worse!" exclaimed Walter, passion- ately, as he stooped to ki s her. "Walter! are you crying?" ejaculated Annette, as a hot, tear fell upon her cheek. "I do not know," replied Walter, with an unnatural laugh. "Perhaps I am; I will not answer for what I may do when the thought passes over me that I may one day lose you!" "How sweet it is to be so dearly loved," said Annette, softly. "Ah, Walter, waiting seems easier now."  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC8179-00000161"/> 326        ANNETTE; OR, CHAPTER    XXXVIII. WALTER S VENGEANCE, DURING the following week, Walter tried to skttle in his mind what course he should pursue in order to protect Annette from further insult. To leave her now, that he had brought so much trouble upon her, would be positively cruel; there remained, therefore, but this alternative, either to leave P--- altogether, And seek an- other home where they were not so well known, or\to remain where they were, and endeavor to live down the calt nious reports of which they were at'present the victims. To Wal. the first seemed the preferable course; but Annette regarded it as a cowardly retreat before the enemy's guns. Elizabeth would never understand it, she was sure.     / Finding it impossible to move Annette on this point, Valter now turned his attention to diverting the public opinion in his favor. How this was to be done, however, was a problem n: so easy to solve, as the persons among whom they lived Already looked upon Annette and himself as lost souls. Let them think what they chose, however, that would not affect him if they would but cease talking; that was what he wished to put an end to. The more he reflected on the subject, Lthe stronger became his conviction that the Stones, both father and son, were the ones chiefly concerned in the circulation of the story now afloat. Through them, therefore, a defensive blow must be struck. Acting, accordingly, on this resolution, he made his way to   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        327 Mr. Stone's on the last day of the week, to prevent any recur- rence of the trouble of the previous Sunday. The Rev. Archibald was at home, seated in his library, pre- paring the morrow's discourse, and received his unexpected visitor with a good deal of inward perturbation and outward calmness. "I fear that I have called at an unseasonable hour," said Walter, glancing at the books and papers upon the table'; " but I will not trespass very long upon your valuable time, and I trust that our interview may have a beneficial effect upon your sermon." "No hour is unseasonable, sir, to a clergyman," replied Mr. Stone. "He is at the service of rich and poor at all times. Take a seat, sir; take a seat," and he pushed a chair towards Walter. "Thank you," replied Walter, making no further use of the chair than to place his hands upon' its back. "My business with you will, I hope, be too quickly dispatched to render it necessary for me to sit down." "If there is,anything that I can do for you--" began Mr. Stone, blandly, with a Christian air of interest; -but he was suddenly interrupted by Walter. "There is a great deal that you not only can but must do for me, Mr. Stone," said he, " before we part this evening." "I am sure it will give me great pleasure," continued Archibald, as quietly as though no interruption' had occurred. "I am extremely glad to hear it," replied Walter, " for it will make my task all the easier; let us to the point at once, then. I have a simple question to ask you, sir, to which I re- quest a simple answer; and according to that answer I will. : regulate my future course of action. Mr. Stone, did you or did you not refer to Miss Purden and her present residence at Bellevue, in your last Sunday's sermon?"  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC8179-00000162"/> 328.       ANNETTE; O'R, "My dear sir!" exclaimed Archibald, washing his hands urbanely. "What an extraordinary question! How can you expect me to remember words or thoughts expressed in any particular sermon, especially one preached without notes?" "Perhaps you can recall the text," said Walter, " and some of the leading remarks." Archibald regarded the arm of his chair thoughtfully for a few mpments, and then said, shaking his head and sighing deeply: s It is of no use; the infirmity of increasing age, my dear sir! I can recall nothing of it; I hope it was an edifying discourse??" "That you shall judge for yourself when I have refreshed your:memory on a few points," replied Walter. "I have heard through various sources, sir, that your son and yourself have assisted in the promulgation of an infamous, slander in regard to Miss Purden; and that you so far forgot, on the last Sunday, the Christian principles you pretend to teach, as to designate her (of course not by name, even you would scarcely dare to do that) as one who had ' fallen from her high estate as a child of God,' and was living in open defiance of both moral and religious sentiments. Now, sir, this young lady is as pure as the angels in heaven! and it would be well for you and yours were you all as certain of eternal salvation as she is! I have come here to-day to enlighten you, if you are indeed laboring under a mistake, in regard to her character, and to ask whether I am to consider your remarks as personal." 'The young lady may be all that you say," replied Mr. Stone, "and I have no reason to doubt that she is," he con- tinued, hastily, as he noticed Walter's lowering brow; ' but can you deny, sir, that she is acting rather-a-- imprudently in continuing to live at Bellevue duiring your sister's absence?"

You evade it! but, nevertheless, I must have an answer before I leave!" "And of what consequence is it what I may or may not have said?" replied Mr. Stone. "If the young lady is inno- cent, then she need not fear what any one says." "It is of great consequence to me!" replied Walter. "I do not choose that a guest of mine shall be foully slandered whilst I am at hand to protect her!" "What is it that you wish me to do?" inquired Archibald. "If- I am mistaken, and your sermon had no personal appli- cation," replied Walter, "I have nothing to ask of you but that you will remove the impression made by it upon your congregation." "And if it be otherwise?" inquired Mr. Stone. "In that case," said Walter, sternly, "I know of nothing that could prevent my taking you by the throat, and breaking my walking-stick over your back!" Walter had drawn a step or two nearer during this speech, and now stood within easy reach of Mr. Stone, on whom he fixed his flashing eyes. Mr. Stone felt very uncomfortable; nevertheless, he retained his composure, and turning his mild gaze upon Walter, said: "I think, sir, you have forgotten that you are speaking to a clergyman!" "Under the imaginary circumstances," replied Walter, "I should consider myself justified in remembering only that you were an unscrupulous villain, and treating you accordingly." A look of saintly patience passed over Mr. Stone's face. "Ah! well," he said, " it is my duty to bear patiently with an enemy, and if he smite me on the right cheek, to turn to 28 *, , .  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC8179-00000163"/> 330         ANNETTE; OR, him the left! Go on, young man! vituperate my honest name and holy calling! I will not-answer you back." "I have no desire to be other than just to you," replied Walter. "You have but to deny the implication derived by your own flock from your sermon, and promise to enlighten them as to the truth, and you will hear no more from me." "Why should I deny it - " began Mr. Stone. "Then you admit it?" cried Walter, fiercely. "No! no!" replied Archibald, becoming very pale, as Walter drew still nearer. "You mistake me, my dear sir; I was about to remark that it seemed scarcely necessary to deny an inference so entirely at variance with my well-known charac- ter for charity. I never preach personal sermons, Mr. West- brooke; and if I have been so unfortunate -as to wound a too sensitive nature, or to leave a doubtful impression upon my hearers, of course I will do all in my power to repair the evil." ' That is all that I could ask," said Walter, slightly inclining his head. "I will therefore take my leave, only recommend- ing to your attention the fact that it is very unsafe to preach enigmatical sermons!" "I will endeavor to bear it in mind for the future," replied Mr. Stone, as he rose, with alacrity, to open the door for his visitor, who, with a quiet 'goed-afternoon," passed out, and left him to the consideration both of the sermon he was about to preach, and the one that had just been preached to him. Having succeeded so well with the father, Walter determined to come to an understanding with the son, without loss of time, and knowing by experience where he was to be found on a Saturday evening, he turned his steps towards the tavern. Arrived at the door, Walter turned up his coat-collar, and pulled his hat over his eyes, before entering, that he might not be immediately recognized.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       33I As he had expected, Joseph and his friends were seated in the bar-room, before a table covered with bottles and glasses, and when he entered their merriment was at its height. A burst of laughter greeted one of Bill Jones' witty sallies, under cover of which Walter stole quietly in and ensconced himself, with his back to them, on the opposite side of the room. No one noticed his entrance, and the conversation proceeded without restraint; thus Walter had an opportunity of listening, for half an hour or more, to their anecdotes, their opinions in respect to the speed of various horses, and other things equally uninteresting. Nothing was said, however, on the subject that had brought him hither, and Walter at last determined to leave as quietly as he had come, and postpone the purpose of his visit to another occasion. Just as he had come to this conclusion, and was rising to leave the room, his attention was suddenly arrested by Bob . Williams, who exclaimed: "What's the matter with Joe? I say, boys, he's going under the table!" "No, I'm not!" said Joe, indignant at the imputation of being drunk thus early in the evening. "Then what the devil are you after?" said Bob. "I'm putting myself out!" spluttered Joe, clutching his shirt front with both hands, and struggling convulsively with himself. "And where the deuce are you going to put yourself?" said Bill Jones, whilst the others stared at him in utter bewilder- ment. "I'm putting myself out./" reiterated Joseph. "I'm- on-- fire! O Lord! it's burnt through to the skin;" and  he tore at his shirt more frantically than before.            vr   &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC8179-00000164"/> 332        ANNETTE;, OR, "' On fire!" exclaimed his companions, starting up to his assistance; and on forcibly removing his hands, they discovered a round hole burnt entirely through his shirt. "By Jove!" exclaimed Bob, half choking with laughter, "if he has n't really set himself on fire! Well, if you are n't the biggest fool I ever set my two eyes upon! You ought to have a nurse to follow you about."    - "How in the name of all that's wonderful did you do it?" asked one. "Spontaneous combustion!" replied another. {' Organic inflammation of the heart striking upward!" shouted a third. "It was the ashes of my cigar," growled Joseph, sulkily. "Boys," said Bill, solemnly, "don't you believe the first word of that! No cigar ashes ever burned such a hole as that in a fellow's shirt. It's the heart that did it, and no mistake." "Poor Joe!" said another, patting him on the shoulder in mock compassion; "did it take the disease so hardly? It's gone worse with him than the chicken-pox or the measles!" "Never mind, Joey!" said Bill, " it will soon be over! The ' eye-teeth' are the hardest to cut; but when they are once through, then you 'll be ' a little man!' " "Stop your chaff!"said Joe, angrily; "I 'll stand no more from any of -you! I've heard enough about that damned girl, and you shan't run me any more!" "My dear fellow!" exclaimed Bob, "we don't want to 'run' you; you do it fast enough for yourself, without assist- ance." "What are you aiming at?" exclaimed Joe, fiercely. "When did you ever catch me running away, I should like to know?" "I don't know that I ever actually saw you," replied Bob,   THE CHRONICLES OP BELLEVUE.        333 carelessly; "but I 'll wager ten to one that you would make good time if the lady of your affections stood behind you." "Do you mean to insinuate that I'm afraid of the girl?" said Joseph. ( I know that the girl was so afraid of having to marry you, that she took up with the devil in preference!" replied Bob, quietly; which remark was followed by a burst of laughter from all the others, Joe excepted. "It's a lie!" shouted Joe, starting to his feet. "She wanted ; to marry me! She was desperately in love with me; but I knew just what sort of a girl she was, and would n't have any- thing to do with her." "You would n't marry her now, I suppose," said Bill, with a shrewd twinkle in his eye, " even if she had asked me to men- tion to you that she was agreeable." "Marry her now!" exclaimed Joseph; "not exactly. I marry a girl who has lost her character! who is an object of scorn to all who know her. I'm not quite such a greenhorn. I tell you, sir, before I'd consent to marry Annette Purden -"  But here his speech came to a sudden termination; and he stretched his length upon the floor, felled by a blow from Wal- ter, who had drawn near unobserved. Joe's companions drew back a few paces, and looked with contemptuous compassion upon their fallen mate; but no one moved to assist him to his feet, as he lay writhing upon the ground. "O Lord!" he groaned, " what's the matter? Who knocked me down?" "You had better get up and discover," said Walter, sternly; and taking him by the collar, he pulled him up to his feet again. % "Gentlemen," he continued, still holding Joe in durance  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC8179-00000165"/> 334        ANNETTE; OR, vile, "when I tell you that I am the friend and protector of theI young lady just mentioned, and that every word which this! scoundrel has uttered in regard to her is a groundless lie, I am sure you will excuse me for breaking up your pleasant party by taking justice into my own hands, and thrashing him here and  now."              - "You shan't do it," yelled Joe, struggling violently in Wal- ter's powerful grasp. "Some of you fellows come and help me. He'll kill me!" The " fellows" looked askance at one another. "It 's a personal affair," muttered Bob. "It is n't any of my business," said Bill; and the rest of the party seemed to acquiesce in their neutrality. "Let me go!" shrieked Joe once more; but to no purpose, for Walter's cane fell upon his shoulders at the same moment, and so quick and sure were the blows he dealt, that there was no time for further parley. "There," exclaimed Walter, at length, quite out of breath, "I think that ought to do for the present. If you want any more, however, you know  how to get it; a repetition of the words you have spoken this evening, or anything said deroga- tory to Miss Purden, will produce the same result. Good- evening, gentlemen, "he continued, releasing Joe, who fell into the first convenient chair; "the performance is over. I am sorry to have interrupted your conversation," and, with a polite bow, he took his leave, and passed out into the street unmo- lested by either Joe or his companions.    CHAPTER XXXIX. A TERRIBLE DISCLOSURE. WALTER'S energetic behavior had the desired effect, and for the time being put a stop to the gossip of? ; for no one felt inclined to risk offendingone who was so ready to avenge his wrongs. Peace again reigned at Bellevue, and Annette's happiness was only troubled when she remembered that Elizabeth must soon return; for she dreaded her censure in regard to the step she had taken in her absence. Walter himself seemed to grow uneasy as the time drew near, and although he assured Annette that her fears were groundless, he nevertheless tried very hard to persuade her to leave P for a while, until he had made the necessary explanations to Elizabeth. But this Annette resolutely refused to do, saying that she had done nothing wrong, and would not therefore subject herself to suspicion by running away. If Elizabeth were angry, she would be very much distressed;- nevertheless, she would stay where she was until she heard her opinion, whatever it might be. Fur- thermore, she suggested that Walter should meet Elizabeth in New York when the vessel arrived, and tell her the true state of the case, lest the gossip of? should reach her first and :: prejudice her mind against them.  This Walter agreed to do at last; but, unfortunately, the vessel arrived sooner than was, expected, and the Rev. Archi-.  bald Stone; who happened to be in New York, received Eliz- abeth instead of her brother, and thus the very misfortune befell them that they had been so anxious to avoid.   &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC8179-00000166"/> 336        ANNETTE; OR, It wculd be impossible to describe Elizabeth's distress at the account she heard from -Mr. Stone of the proceedings at Bellevue. That Walter had returned, after she left, to bid her good-bye, did not seem improbable; but why he should have remained when he found Annette alone, she could not under- stand. It was with a heavy heart that she at last reached home. Her spirits revived for a moment as Annette, alone, came forth to meet her. Perhaps there was no truth in the story after all, and she had been needlessly worried; jbut Annette's agitation, her evasive answers and confusion when Elizabeth spoke of Walter, soon quenched this small spark of hope, and convinced her that Archibald had grounds for his suspicions. And where was Walter? Annette had been asking herself the question all day long. He had made one- last attempt to get her to go away with him, that morning, and had pleaded long and earnestly that she would listen to his advice, and give Elizabeth time to recover from her surprise before she met her; but Annette was not to be overruled on this point, and persisted in remaining where she was. "Make your own way, then!" exclaimed Walter, "and if we are both ruined, you may thank your own obstinacy!!" say- ing which, he had turned on his heel and abruptly left her; and since then she had seen nothing of him. Annette was looking and feeling very unwell. This long strain upon her nervous system had told upon a constitution never very strong; and Elizabeth was struck at once by the change that had taken place in the light-hearted girl. Who- ever was in fault, she decided that Walter- was the one to be spoken to; so she maintained a strict silence towards Annette on the subject. At dinner, Walter had not yet made his appearance, and    1i n  L1 V lnLI L. oi 'Vv A JoA V uV i . J S/ although the two ladies did their best to appear unconstrained, a cloud hung between them which they found impossible to dispel, and the conclusion of the meal was a relief to both. When Elizabeth had gone up stairs, Annette sought refuge in an alcove of the parlor window, which Walter had screened off for her during the summer, and within which was placed a sofa. This had been her favorite resting-place on many a sul- tryafternoon, and hither she now came to give vent, unobserved, to the tears and sobs which threatened to suffocate her. A pas- sionate fit of weeping was succeeded at length by a calmer flow of tears, followed in its turn by an apathetic calm, born of her  physical weakness, which finally merged into slumber. How long she had slept she could not tell, before a sound of voices penetrated her dreams; but by degrees she came to con- sciousness, and recognized Elizabeth's voice raised to a higher pitch than usual from intense excitement. "And have you no better excuse than this to offer for your- self?" she exclaimed, as Annette Wonderingly opened her eyes. "No other reason to urge for the ruin of this poor child than that you loved her? Love! Alas! how the word is misused, and the passion mistaken!" "I fought against my heart as long as I was able," responded Walter's voice; but oh! how changed it sounded. "I left her, as you know, when I found that I could not control my feelings, and determined never to see her again until she was the wife of another; but you summoned me back again. I came, and found her alone, and also discovered that she loved me. How could I leave her then? I am but a man, and fate was against me!" "Ah! how you men shirk duty and then curse 'fate! ' "' - exclaimed Elizabeth. "Was there no honor in you, Walter Westhrooke, that you could beguile the heart of an innocent 29          W    &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC8179-00000167"/> ANNETTE; 6R, girl, whose lonely and friendless condition made your protection all the more necessary? Why did I leave her? Oh! it almost breaks my heart to think what has befallen Arthur Purden's child, to whom I promised a mother's care!" and Elizabeth's voice broke down from excessive emotion. ' Now he will tell her," thought Annette, as she lay still with beating heart, awaiting Walter's response. But Walter said nothing, and a smothered sob from Elizabeth was all that broke the silence. "And what will you do now?" said Elizabeth, at length. "You cannot suppose that I will allow her to remain with you?" "I do not know; I have not thought about it," stammered Walter. "No! I suppose not! nor of anything besides your own selfish pleasure!" exclaimed Elizabeth, bitterly. 'Oh! my God, what is to become of the poor child! Homeless! friend- less! what can she do! where can she go to hide her shame!" This was more than Annette could stand, and waiting but a moment to hear whether or not Walter would confess the truth like a man, she emerged from her hiding-place, and confronted Elizabeth. "What have I done, Miss Mordaunt?" she exclaimed, with flashing eyes, "that you should use such strong language in regard to me?  Why am I  homeless and friendless, and why should I hide my head?" Walter, who was standing by the mantel, started at the sound of her voice; and, at sight of her, as with proud step and erect head she came  forward from the, shadow, he buried his own head in his hands with a groan. Elizabeth gazed at her in speechless sorrow. At length, she said, in a wondering tone:    "She asks me why she should be ashamed! This gentle, innocent, loving girl, that had made herself dear to me, despite ; all prejudice to the contrary,-asks me, with the air of an Empress, why she should shun the face of her fellow-creatures! i. The Lord be merciful to you, child! the Lord be merciful!" and Elizabeth's emotion entirely overcame her for the second time. "Walter," said Annette, turning to him, deeply affected by Elizabeth's evident distress-"Why do you not tell your sister the truth, and relieve her mind?"  Elizabeth looked up quickly at these words, and, rising t her feet, exclaimed:           . O Walter, if there is any explanation to be given, do not keep me longer in suspense. If you have anything to say, say -: it at once, I beseech you." -j                ' ; But Walter made no answer, neither did he raise hid head  . from his hands.                 V      x 'Walter,' said Annette, gently-- I what is the matter? Why do you not speak and defend me? Ah, he is afraid you will be angry," she continued, glancing at Elizabeth, who had retreated i to her original position in dumb distress.  Leaving Walter, Annette "crossed  the room, and kneeling .% down before her, she said:                  i "Look at me, dear Miss Mordaunt; look into my/ eyes and d tell me if you see there aught of shamed or disgrace?"  - - Elizabeth raised her head and looked into the face of the  :i^s kneeling girl. Flushed with excitement it was, but every line  seemed marked with purity and innocence, whilst a clear, e ::A truthful, and serene light shone in her soft, blue eyes.  ;?}i "Ah! child, child!" said Elizabeth, sobbing, " I am lost in '- amazement.

"Who dares to couple my name with such a word! Listen now, whilst Zanswer your questions asked some moments since, as to what was to become of me now that you have returned.

Behold, then, that I have both a home and a friend! My home being the place where I now  am, and my friend--stands nder!-your brother, Elizabeth   Mordaunt, but nmy us-  Sand!" "For God's sake! Netta "- gasped Walter; but it was too late; the fatal words had been spoken --and Elizabeth, pale as death, had-risen from her chair, and was slowly approaching them. "Are you mad !" she articulated, with an effort, as she paused before Annette, "or amn I dreaming! What didyou call yourself?-his wife " "Aye, his wife!" repeated Annette, proudly meeting her e with a look of conscious innocence that betokened her honesty and truthfulness. "His wife! my God  ! then what is'she whom he married seven years ago I "Elizabeth almost whispered these words, so intense was her agitation; but every word fell with fatal dis- tinctness on Annette's ear, and life seemed suddenly to stand still. A moment she gazed motionless at Elizabeth, as though her words had turned her to stone, then springing towards Walter, she seized him by the arm, exclaiming: "Walter! Walter! do yo  hear what she says? Will you stand silently by whilst she tells me that I am not your wife-? his is no tim e for concealment," she continued, passionately, "or for personal consideration. M y honor is at stake, Walter;   she will not believe me when I tell her we are married. Speak - to her, my husband. Tell her that in; very truth we are joined ; tSii together according to the laws of God and man. ' Her voice shook with emotion, her frame quivered with  intense agitation, yet Walter moved not nor spoke. She remained a moment watching, with strained eyes aad  ears for the upraising of his head in her defence; but when he: spoke not, a fearful foreboding seized her heart, and she shiv- - ered from head to foot; then, throwing herself upon the ground before him, she clasped him about the knees, crying wildly: "My darling!

His  face seemed&amp; cast in an iron mould, and the wild misery of his" eyes alone told of the agony he was enduring.        !  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC8179-00000169"/> "He will not speak!" exclaimed Annette, suddenly raising herself again to her knees. "He hears me, sees me, and says not one word of denial in regard to what she says! It is true, then? I have no home? I have no friends? A dishonored outcast must I flee to some secluded spot, and there forever hide my head? He does not speak!" she shrieked, again tossing her arms wildly over her head. "It is all true! My God! My God! Oh, let me die!" and she sank forward again, fall- ing unconscious at Walter's feet. A little moan escaped his lips, as he stooped to raise her inanimate form. He took her in his arms to carry her to her room, and on the way thither he showered kisses on the white, still face, the soft brown hair, the little waxen hands, with min- gled sobs and groans; but all unheeded they fell upon the sense- less form, as Annette lay in a. swoon as dark as death. "Go!" said Elizabeth, as he laid his precious burden down upon the bed in that little room where she had so often thought and dreamed of him- , and may God forgive you the ruin you have wrought!!" Silently he withdrew from the room. What right had he, the destroyer, to remain in the presence of his victim. Down the stairs and out of the house he went, like one in a dream; out into the deepening shadows, to pace with uneven steps beneath her window, and listen, in agonizing suspense; for a sound of life from the room above. Ah! what memories crowded his brain through that long vigil! At that window, a little more than a year before, she had stood and sung in the moonlight! and as the soft notes had stolen into his heart, he had stood where he now was, and watched the changeful expression of her face! There had he first seen into her heart, and dreamed what her love would be when once aroused! Alas!. how changed now was that face,   so beautiful then in the reflection of what in reality had wrecked her life! The night closed in, and the damp, chill air almost benumbed his senses, yet still he walked the ground, absorbed in these painful reflections. At length he returned to the house, hoping to leave behind him his sad heart; but within as without he found no rest, and wandered up and down the hall, tempted to exclaim, with Cain: "My punishment is greater than I can bear!" CHAPTER XL. REMORSE.,  THE day was breaking in the east when Walter heard his name called from the hall above. Hastening up-stairs, he encountered Elizabeth coming in search of him. "Walter!" she said, hurriedly, as she perceived him ap- proaching, " go quickly for the doctor! Annette is very sick! Bring Mrs. Wellesley with you, also," she added, as he ran down the stairs. s I must have some one to share my respon- sibility as nurse." Walter was out of the hall-door in a moment, and in a: very short time drove rapidly past the house on his way to. the village. Dr. Webster was easily found, and, accustomed to- be sum- moned from his sleep at all hours, was soon on his way to Bellevue; but oit was quite another affair to arouse poor, timid Mrs. Wellesley, and persuade her to accompany him. Walter's &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC8179-00000170"/> 344         ANNETTE; OR, patience was sorely tried by her many questions, and the time she took to make her toilet. - Even after she had actually got as far as the door, she remembered a dozen things she might want that she had forgotten; but Walter absolutely placed her in the wagon and drove away, consoling her with a promise that anything she wanted should be sent after her. When they finally arrived at Bellevue, the sun was above the horizon, and Walter entered the house in fear and trembling, lest something had occurred during these precious hours that he had been forced to waste, and Annette had passed away from his sight forever. But Betsy met hem at the door, and told him that although very ill, Annette was still alive; and, leaving him in the hall, she escorted Mrs. Wellesley up the stairs. Left alone again, Walter strode restlessly up and down, en- deavoring, as it were, to deaden his mental suffering by bodily weariness, whilst he awaited the doctor's appearance from above. Hour after hour passed and yet he did not leave the sick- room. Walter's suspense grew intense. When at length his weary limbs refused to support him any longer, he sank into a chair at the foot of the stairs, and watched and waited still. Oh! the length of those weary hours'! He feared to look forward, he dared not think of the past! therefore, he remained in a scarcely conscious state, almost paralyzed by his misery. To lose Annette at all would be hard enough, but were she to die before he had the poor consolation of exculpating himself of any intention of wronging her, he felt that he should go mad. The doctor came at last, and Walter eagerly interrogated him. "How is your patient, doctor?" he said, in a husky voice. "She is very ill, sir," replied the doctor, without stopping. "Not dangerously ill!" gasped Walter. "You do not think that she will die?"  "She is in danger of worse than death," replied the doctor, Xi gravely; "at present she is raving mad! God knows whether  - she will ever recover her reason!" "Great heavens!" exclaimed Walter, grasping his arm to  - , detain him. "What can be the cause of this, doctor? Can it be possible that she has inherited the malady?" "Insanity is not always hereditary," replied the doctor. "It proceeds from numberless causes. She has, as you must know, been ailing some time, and her illness seems to have   - been accelerated by some sudden shock, which has also de- : throned her reason." Walter said no more. Releasing his hold, he permitted the doctor to pass on, and stood in silence overwhelmed with this i new misfortune which had come upon him.             ! For once he forgot himself entirely. The thought of all that Annette had suffered at his hands completely overcame    him; and, possessed with but one idea, namely, to atone for  the past if possible by the future, he turned and hastened to her room.                -: Should she recover from her present illness, he inwardly , determined to carry out his original plan, and take her away  :; from?  as soon as she could be moved. Even were her    - mind still disordered, he felt convinced that, far from the scene of her trouble, and under his tender care, she must sooner or later recover.  Elizabeth met him at the chamber-door.     .   . Her eyes were swollen and red; but she made no remark, silently stepping aside to allow him to enter.        :::  The room was darkened, and on the bed reclined Annette,  -: half sitting, half lying.

ANNETTE; OR, In her arms she held an infant, and as she rocked herself backward and forward, she moaned, rather than sang, a lullaby. At sight of her Walter's-heart leaped within him, and then sank down again like lead. Oh, the piteous beauty of that face, the wreck of what was once so fair, until the destroyer left his mark upon it! "She begged of God your life!" sobbed Elizabeth, as he stood ,rooted to the spot, unable to go either forward or back. "I heard her innocent, guileless prayer, and preserved you 'to become her destroyer!'" "Who is that?" said Annette, raising her head at the sound of Elizabeth's voice. "Walter," she continued, as her gaze fell upon him, "is it you? Come hither, dearest, and look upon our little son!" "It is dead!"- said Elizabeth, faintly. "It only lived a few minutes; but she will not let us take it from her." "Dead!" repeated Annette, looking from one to the other. "Yes, thank God, it is dead!  What did I say?" she ex- claimed suddenly, in great excitement. "Oh, that I should jive to thank God that my baby was dead!" and drooping her head upon her breast, she wept and moaned again. "Ah! my little one," she sobbed, " is this the end of all my hopes and prayers? How often, oh, how often in my dreams have I felt your little arms about my neck, and looked into your bright eyes with love and wonder! Alas-! my dreams are only dreams, and I awake to know that hope and you are dead! You shall not take it from me!" she exclaimed fiercely, as, with flashing eyes, she pressed the infant closer to her breast. "  Are you not satisfied?" she continued, fixing her gaze on vacancy. "You have taken from me my father, mother, hus. band! my hopes and happiness! Leave me my baby, relent- less fate!"   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        347 - For a time she remained silent, and they hoped that she was falling into a slight slumber. Elizabeth made another effort to remove the-child, hoping that once out of sight, Annette's excitement would be allayed; but in a moment Annette was wide awake again, and holding it tighter than before. "Why do you touch it?" she exclaimed. ".It sleeps well; you may wake it too soon! Ah! do not trouble its slumbers; there is so much weariness in the world. I want to go to sleep myself! It has blue eyes, Walter," she continued ; " it opened them once, and smiled upon me! - or did I dream it? Life is so like a dream, I scarce know truth from fiction; but I think my baby smiled at me, and said, ' Thou shalt meet me in heaven! ' then it closed its sweet eyes again, and its spirit passed away!  It opened them again in heaven, Walter. Straight to our Father's throne it hath flown, and there it pleads, with tiny clasped hands, for you and me-its father and its mother! But what is it that we i lave done?" she continued, with a perplexed look. ' "What is this-sense of sin that oppresses me so? I cannot understand it. Ah! well, God knows it, and He will do what is best!" so saying, she sank back upon the pillows, and, thoroughly exhausted, fell asleep at last. So deep was her slumber, that they removed the child with- out her perceiving it, and theday was well-nigh spent when she awoke. The doctor had returned, and in, dread suspense her friends . had stood around her bed, fearing lest her eyes were closed forever; great therefore was their relief when she at last looked up with her usual gentle expression, and proved herself to be rational again. Perceiving that she was conscious, the doctor motioned Wal-  ter to leave the room, lest the sight of him should arouse sad f;  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC8179-00000172"/> 348         ANNETTE; OR, recollections; and he crept noiselessly away, with a heart full of thankfulness that her life was spared. Two weeks passed slowly by, during which Walter did not ask to see Annette. His mind was set upon one thing, namely, to explain his conduct to her; and he felt that, until he could speak plainly, it would be useless pain to inflict his presence upon her. Elizabeth promised to admit him as soon as the doctor thought proper, and he awaited as patiently as he could this interview, which he felt would decide his future destiny. If Annette consented to his wishes, there was still a bright spot to look forward to in life; but if she refused, and condemned him to total separation, nothing but despair appeared before him. A life of constant and racking remorse, such as this would entail upon him, seemed too bitter to be borne. After Annette had been allowed to leave her bed, and sit up for a little while every day in her chair, Elizabeth had deter- mined to plead for Walter's admittance; but whenever she looked at her, her resolution gave way, and, fearing to open the subject first, she waited for Annette to ask some question rela- tive to him. But Annette asked nothing; indeed, she rarely spoke at all, but sat all day long, with her hands lying in her lap, gazing vacantly before her. "Where did they put my baby?" she asked one day, with quivering lips; and Elizabeth, rolling her chair to the window, silently pointed to the old chestnut-tree, beneath which was visible a little newly made grave. After this, each day she made them place her again beside the window. Sitting thus one day, she suddenly turned to Elizabeth, saying: "Your brother may come to me now, if he desires to do so."   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        349 Walter received the summons with reviving hope, for he had begun to fear that Annette would never consent to listen to his story, and he hastened at once to her room. Pale and motionless she sat in her accustomed seat, and neither moved nor spoke as he approached her. He stood beside her for a moment in silence, and then put- ting his arm around her-"My darling I " he said, and would have kissed her, but, shrinking from his embrace, she pointed silently to a chair at some distance from her own. Walter turned from her without a word, and seated himself -where she indicated. A pause ensued, which it seemed as though neither of them could break, so overcome were they by their feelings. At last Annette spoke-falteringly, almost unintelligibly, it is true; yet the spell that bound them was broken by her voice. "I have sent for you," she said, " to hear your story! It is but justice to hear what you have to say for yourself!" "But are you strong enough to bear so much excitement?" said Walter, gently. "Shall we not defer all explanations until you have entirely recovered? Take my assurance that things are not so bad as they seem, and let me nurse you back to health before I enter into particulars." 'No!" said Annette, decidedly. "We have waited too long already! Ah! had I but known all before I married you!" " "Would to God you had!" said Walter; "but it is too late to think of that!" "Put off the recital no longer, then," replied Annette, "lest it be 'too late ' forever! Go on, I beseech you, and tell your  tale minutely! Spare me no detail; for I desire to know at once what of good or evil there is in you! Surely I havee -:; ^ earned the right to hear the truth at last!"        : 30  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC8179-00000173"/> ANNETTE; OR, "I will tell you all, to the minutest detail that I can remem- ber," replied Walter. "I have no desire to hide aught from your eyes; but I pray you be patient, and wait a few days longer." "Not a day! not an hour!" cried Annette. "I will have the truth, the whole truth, and at once " "There is nothing left me but to obey you," said Walter, after a moment's pause, during which he anxiously regarded her. "I will therefore begin my narrative, and tell you all that you wish to know, as honestly and truthfully as if in con- fession. "When I was quite young, little more than a boy," he con- tinued, "I was launched upon the world without an anchor. Deprived of both father and mother, and with no guardian but my sister Elizabeth, I assumed the entire control of myself and my property at an age when it was least advisable to do so. -"The world and its pleasures lay before me spread out like a garden of flowers; and, entering on my course, surrounded by false friends and flatterers, I sipped sweets from every flower, regardless of the poison that lurks sometimes in the fairest. ( My chosen friend was a young man by the name of Stude- vant, a Frenchman by birth. He was a wild, reckless fellow, possessed of great personal beauty, and a great variety of ac- complishments. He generally took the lead in all our escapades. "One night, weary of the monotony of our respectable Eng- lish entertainments, he suggested that we should amuse ourselves by visiting a small French theatre in an out-of-the-way part of the town, with which he was well acquainted. I agreed at once, as I did to most of his suggestions, and we were soon on our way-he to make a fool of me, and I to my destruction. The company in which we found ourselves was not the most select; but I was not of the age to be very choice in that re-    THE CHRONICLES OF -BELLEVUE.       351 spect, and accepted things as I found them, being amply com- pensated for all else by the principal actress, who carried my susceptible heart by storm as soon as she appeared upon the stage. "The play itself possessed but little interest, and Studevant yawned more than once during the performance; but I cared for nothing but that graceful figure upon the stage, and the most stupid commonplaces seemed sparkling 'bon-mots,' when spoken by those ruby lips. "'Let us go behind the scenes! ' I exclaimed, as the curtain fell amid the plaudits of the undiscriminating public, in which I was not behindhand.  "Nonsense,' said Studevant, laughing. ' What should we . do that for? There is no one worth speaking to but "La Belle Amalie," and she will have naught to say to us.'  "'What?' said I, 'does she belong to the "invincibles?" So much the better! Let us charge the fortress!' "'Mon Dieu!' said Studevant; with a yawn. 'How en-  thusiastic you are. How I wish I was young again.'  "'How old are you?' said I. "'Twenty-six, if you count my years,' said he, laughing;  'but a hundred years older than Methuselah, if you count my sins. Lead on, I11 introduce you to your divinity, but after  that you must take care of yourself.'  "' All right,' said I, and we went on to the green-room. "Amahe was not there, but a note from Studevant soon procured us admittance to her private room, where she received ; us with such becoming modesty and decorum, and was so much -:':) handsomer even than I had supposed, that I fell a victim to : : her charms at once, nor made an effort to escape the toils. :,: "Studevant left me, as he had said he should, and I escorted!- s! my goddess home; not alone, however, for a tall woman, ;1:-   &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC8179-00000174"/> 352        ANNETTE; OR, dressed in black, accompanied us and kept an argus eye upon me. Arrived at her house, Hexpected to be invited in, but, with many blushes and sweet smiles, she told me that her aunt with whom she lived was absent, and therefore, as she never received gentlemen at that hour alone, she would be obliged to send me away, ungracious as it might seem; but she hoped I would not forget her so entirely as never to call again. "With many assurances that to forget her would be impos- sible, I pressed her hand, and returned home inwardly rejoicing that she was so prudent, and congratulating myself on the dis- covery of a pearl of great price. s"The next night found me at the theatre again, and the next, and the next. In fact I became perfectly infatuated with Amalie. In vain Studevant expostulated, and other of my companions ridiculed me. I still devoted all my time to the engrossing pursuit of my goddess.       \ ;' There was one thing that seemed strange, and that was, the more ardently I pressed my suit, the more coy she became. Only one explanation of her conduct occurred to me-fool that I was-and I thought she feared dishonorable proposals. "This view of the case only heightened my esteem, and added respect to my burning passion; which culminated at last in a resolution to marry her, if there were no other way of obtaining her love." Here Walter paused, overcome by his emotion. It was a long time since he had thus circumstantially recalled these scenes, and the memory of this his first, real love, and the miseries attendant on it, completely overpowered him.   CHAPTER XLI. WALTER' S STORY.             ; A FTER a moment's pause, however, Walter continued his recital.                      ' ; "I called Studevant into council," he said, "and told him : what I proposed doing, and he told me carelessly that I was a ; great fool; but consented to give his assistance if it were neces-  sary. He reminded me that Amalie did not move in the same  circle as myself, and that my friends would probably frown . upon us both; but I felt no uneasiness on that score, being . a perfectly persuaded that she would be an ornament to any  circle, and really not caring whether my friends did or did not  approve my choice. Give me Amalie for-my own, thought I,  and the world may say what it will,            ,S "It is needless to weary you with the details of my court-  ship; suffice it to say that my suit prospered, and that before -. very long, Amahe had consented to be my wife.       ; : "We were married very quietly; Studevant and Amalie's  .:: aunt being the only witnesses; and then, for a time, I was happy. '.S1 "So fond, so trusting, so loving was Amalie, to all appear-  ances, that my every hope seemed realized. It was agreed  between us that she should remain at the theatre until her en- gagement was at an end, as her generous nature would not :! allow her to defraud the manager of her services until the ; X season was over, and then she was to leave the stage forever; :  and, after travelling with me for a time, was to be ,introduced A to society as my wife.        .

"If Hcould but leave the rest untold!" "What you have said is sufficient," said Annette. "Do not put yourself to further torture; it cannot undo the past." "No! no " replied Walter.  "You must hear it all! You shall know me now as I am, that you may pardon or con- demn, as you see fit! i' There is not much more to tell. The days passed by as merrily as a marriage-bell; and I took no thought for the future, except to dream of the day when Amalie would be mine alone, no longer subject to the rules of the theatre. "At length one evening as I parted from her, she said to me, with a fond, coquettish smile: "'Make the most of your wife to-night, sir, for to-morrow the public claims me." "' To-morrow night? ' said I, in surprise; for although often engaged during the day in rehearsals, after theatre hours she had hitherto been all my own. "'Yes,' she replied. ' To-morrow night you must remain away, or I shall disgrace you at the theatre on the following one, for I have my part to learn in a new play.' She sighed as she spoke, and the separation she announced, though but for a night, seemed to be as grievous to her as to myself. "We embraced each other again and again, in view of this coming separation of twenty-four hours, and never had she seemed to be more fond and caressing than when I left her that night. "The next day passed wearily for me, with no prospect of seeing my darling that evening; and, as the night closed in, I could not refrain from walking around to the house, just to have a glimpse of her as she returned from the theatre. "The night was inclement, the rain poured down in torrents;   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        35  yet I waited impatiently a half hour or more for her carriage to appear. "At last it came, and leaning forward eagerly to see her . face as she alighted, I saw instead the handsome features of my friend. Studevant, who, springing first from the coach, handed  Amalie out, and not only escorted her to the door of the house, but entered with her. f A miserable jealousy seized upon my heart. Why should Studevant disturb her less than myself? I tried to persuade myself that all was right, and my fears of treachery groundless; : yet the more I thought about it, the more wretched I became, until, accidentally feeling my private key in my- pocket, I un- - hesitatingly applied it to the door and entered.        , "I 'stole up the stairs like a thief, and approached the room from whence their voices issued. There was silence for a   : moment, during which I fancied I heard Amalie sobbing,.,and then Studevant said, roughly:                ) "' What are you howling about  Have I not done more    - for you than you have any right to expect? Most men would  , have left you, when weary, without a word or a sign; but I  : have not only told you that I was going, but supplied my place, and 'actually married you to a man of property, who, if you play your cards well, will support you in ease for the rest of -? your life.'                           : ' (I did not want to marry him,' exclaimed Amalie, through - her tears, ' and that you know very well. I only did it when you insisted upon it, and threatened to leave me otherwise! I would rather a thousand times have remained on the stage and  ; ^ still retained your love than have married this overgrown'boy, -: to live forever after, in affluence perhaps, but overpowered by I: his sentimental twaddle!

This was the woman I had thought pure as an angel, and this the man I had called my best friend. "' Stop your crying! ' exclaimed, Studevant, impatiently. 'What have you to complain of? Is it my fault that I do not love you any longer? Can a man remain constant forever? Have done with this folly, and make the best of things as they are, or your precious husband will become suspicious, and you will lose both husband and lover together.' "' IYou are a brute!' exclaimed Amalie. You have won my heart; you know I adore you, and you advise me to trans- fer my affections to a booby whom you forced me to marry through misrepresentations! ' "This was too much; I could stand no more, and without waiting for a moment's reflection, I precipitated myself into the room, and stood face to face with my false friend and his guilty partner. "' Westhrooke! ' ejaculated Studevant. '" ' Mon dieu!' exclaimed Amalie, rushing behind him for protection. "' Come forth, Amalie,' said I, 'you have nothing to fear from me; I do not war with women! Sooner or later your sins will bring their own punishment, and in neglect and pov- erty shall you repent the past! But as for you, sir,' I ex- claimed, turning upon Studevant,' I demand satisfaction for the shameful wrong that you have put upon me. You have be- trayed my friendship, ruined my life, and, above all, cast a stain upon my name, which must be washed away by your blood or my own! Stand forth, if you have any manliness left in you, and accept my challenge! ' 'Studevant never moved a muscle, nor betrayed a symptom of uneasiness. Leaning idly against the centre-table, he calmly surveyed me, as I spoke, with a look of placid interest.  THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        357 "' I do not wish to fight you,' he said, quietly. ' I have done you enough wrong already.' "' But you shall! ' I exclaimed passionately, ' or I will brand you as a coward! ' "A slight flush mounted to his brow at the last word, but he answered as calmly as before : "' If you insist on being shot, and send me an invitation in the regular way, I, of course, as-a gentleman, will attend your wishes at any time or place you may desire; but, meanwhile, do you not think a lady's boudoir rather an unfit place for a quar- rel? Suppose we withdraw, and settle this affair elsewhere.' "' With all my heart,' said I, turning to leave the room; but as Studevant also bent his steps in the direction of the door, Amalie rushed between us with a shriek, and throwing her arms around him, exclaimed: "' Do not go with him, Gustave! do not, I pray! He will kill you; he is so enrage / ' "Studevant shook her off carelessly, and continued on his way, saying, with a laugh: ' Better pray for your husband, ma chere! ' "The preliminaries were soon settled, and we met and ex- changed shots the following day. "The details of the duel would only weary you. I therefore will only say-that my adversary's ball passed several feet above my head, to our great surprise, for he was considered an excel- lent marksman, .whilst mine wounded him slightly in the shoulder. "I would have had him fire again, but he absolutely refused to do this, saying that he had no desire to kill me, and that if I was satisfied, we would retire. "I submitted, although I was far from satisfied; for I had Cal- culated certainly upon either killing my man or being carried home lifeless myself, and 1 began to suspect that he had not   &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC8179-00000177"/> 358        ANNETTE; OR, aimed at me at all, certain of my inability to injure him mate- rially, and not desiring to injure me. "Almost heart-broken I returned home. The miserable life that I had hoped to -have lost was still mine, and what to do with it now was a problem. In my distress I made a full con- fession to my sister, the only true friend of whom I could boast. She entered -heartily into my trouble, and took upon herself all the necessary arrangements for our speedy departure from England. "She it was who suggested our emigration to America; who negotiated with Amalie, through our lawyer, to drop my name for a certain sum of money; and who, giving up home, friends, and kindred, followed me to this country. "From the first day of my arrival here I endeavored to put away all thoughts of my troubles, and tried earnestly to forget that Amahe had ever existed for me; and, indeed, my misfor- tune became, after a time, as vague as a dream. "-It was again brought to life, however, when I began to dis- cover how dear you had become to me. I had never thought that I could love again. I was therefore the more startled when I first perceived how often you were in my thoughts. When, I found my passion uncontrollable, I fled your presence, deter- mining never to see you again until death had broken the fetters that bound me, or you were wedded to another. "When Elizabeth wrote me her intention of returning to England, I begged her to ascertain for me, if possible, what had become of Amalie, without giving her any reason for the request; but shortly after I had written to her I received a letter from my lawyer, informing me that it had been more than a year since -Amalie Duval had drawn her income, and that, as shortly after the last payment an actress answering to her descrip- tion had met with a fatal accident, falling through a scaffolding upon the stage, it was to be supposed that she was dead.   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        359 "On receipt of this news, I started immediately for home   i to prevent Elizabeth from making unnecessary inquiries; but, as you know, she had gone before I arrived. What followed my visit here, you well know; but you do not know that the letter, which felled me to the ground on that day you found me fainting in the library, was from Elizabeth, telling me that Anrahe had answered an advertisement she had caused to be inserted in a newspaper, and was now in good health, only having been prevented from drawing her income by a severe illness of nearly eighteen months. "Oh! my darling! my darling! could you know what I suffered when I read that letter, your gentle nature would for- give me all that I have done! -All the sins of my life were atoned for in that bitter moment, when I read the death-warrant of our future happiness!" Here Walter ceased, being unable to control his grief, and leaning his head upon his hands, gave vent to his over-charged feelings in violent and convulsive sobs. It is painful at any time to see a man weep; but far more dreadful than tears are those dry, gasping sobs, which seem to rend the frame without affording nature the least relief, like a thunder storm without rain. Annette's heart was wrung with anguish at the sight of his suffering, and gladly would she have comforted him, but com- fort there was none. Their case was hopeless, and she could only sit and watch him in dull despair. He recovered his composure, however, after a time, and again turned his face to her, saying: "And now we must look our destiny in the face, and decide how we can best bear the troubles that have come upon us. Ever since you were first taken ill, I have been thinking of your, future, .and after long consideration I have come now to pro- pose that plan which seems to me to be the best.  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC8179-00000178"/> ANNETTE; OR, "Netta," he continued, approaching and taking her hands in his, "we are now one in -the sight of God, and our souls are too firmly knit together to be lightly parted; yet I must not expose my darling to censure. Let us, therefore, fly to some place where we are utterly unknown, where evil tongues will be hushed, and abide there until, freed from the hateful fetters that now hold me, I may renew our marriage vow. I swear before God!" he continued, kneeling before her, "that I will do this, at the first moment of my liberty; and until then I do promise to love, honor, and cherish you as my lawful wedded wife, so long as we both do live! Tell me, shall it be as I say?" and pressing the hands he held to his lips, he kissed them passionately. Annette seemed unable to answer, so overcome was she by emotion. She gazed at the kneeling figure before her, with a look of agony in her eyes, and although she essayed to speak once or twice, no words fell from her lips. "You consent, darling?" said Walter, misinterpreting her silence, and winding his arms around her. With an effort she aroused herself. "Why! oh, why! do you tempt me to sin?" she faltered, making an effort to release herself. "Walter! Walter! I am weak! be strong for me!" "There is no strength required," said Walter, gently. "I am not urging you to do what is wrong. Whatever amiss there might be in this course has been already done, and we cannot undo it by separation."  "Alas, no!" replied Annette, "but, whereas God does not hold us guilty of sin committed through ignorance, yet will He not forgive us if we continue in the same after our eyes have been opened!" "You are taking an exaggerated view of the case!" exclaimed Walter. "You do not consider that we have been actually   v             - -  THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        361 married! Surely you cannot think that I will consent to leave you now? That is out of the question! The only thing to be considered, is whether we will remain here, and brave public opinion, or make a home for ourselves elsewhere!" "And you really do not see what a grievous sin I would commit in yielding to your persuasions?" said Annette, fixing her large eyes inquiringly upon him. "Do not thus stifle your conscience, and trifle with the wrong! We must part! there- fore, let us strive rather to help one another to bear the parting ' with Christian- fortitude, than encourage delusive hopes of happiness!"  "We must not part!" exclaimed Walter, passionately. "O my precious one, I could not bear it! My love for you absorbs my whole being. I cannot, cannot live without you! Ah! did you love me truly, you could not suggest such a course!" "If I loved you truly-as I do," said Annette, slowly, "then would I say, as now- Walter, farewell! Farewell, until the day of our probation' is over! farewell, until with hearts void of offence, we may meet again! and if before that time, this frail thread of life should sever, remember, darling, that there is another and a better life to come, in which we shall be free to love each other! If it be God's will, Walter, farewell until then!"  "But, Netta! my own darling!" exclaimed Walter, in agonized entreaty, "listen to me for a moment longer!" "No!" she replied, "I have heard enough! Go! For God's sake leave me!I can bear no more!" and, disengaging herself from his encircling arms, she sank back fainting in her chair. Alarmed at her condition, Walter feared to remain; reluc- tantly, therefore, he withdrew from the room, and summoned Elizabeth to her assistance. 31 &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC8179-00000179"/> 2         ANNETTE OR, -    ,. CHAPTER     XLII. WITH THE EBB. OR several days after the foregoing conversation Annette was too unwell to bear the least excitement, and Walter was positively forbidden by the physician to hold any commu- nication with, her. He submitted without remonstrance, feeling that this relapse was in great measure owing to his want of consideration in introducing such an exciting subject before Annette- had regained her strength. His distress of mind was great at his want of success in induc- ing Annette to leave Bellevue with him. He had never antici- pated her refusal, thinking that he could easily overcome her objections, so dearly did she love him; and he could not make up his mind to accept her decision as final, hoping against hope that, in the end, she would yield to his wishes. But Annette could be firm when a principle was concerned, although easily guided in all else by her affections; and even after the doctor had removed his prohibition, she steadfastly refused to see Walter again - saying that their former interview had been final, and to meet again would but open their wounds afresh. Elizabeth upheld her in this resolution; and finding that listening all day long for Walter's footsteps, or the sound of his voice, was a constant strain upon Annette's nervous system, she besought him to leave for a time, as such continued excitement must gradually wear Annette's life away. After much persua- sion, he yielded to her advice, and made preparations to go   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.       303 away for a time, secretly hoping that, when Annette heard of his intention, she would not permit him to go alone. The day fixed for his departure arrived, and shortly before -, the hour, Walter tapped lightly at Annette's door, and handed Elizabeth a note for her, requesting permission to bid her fare-  well for the last time. Annette read and re-read this note, and an intense longing seized her to see him once more, to lie again within his arms, and feel his Ups upon her brow. "Only this once!" she murmured to herself. "It shall be the last time! Surely God will forgive this weakness. Let him come in!" she said; and Elizabeth turned to the door to admit him.   But scarcely had she taken a dozen steps in that direction before Annette began to realize how hard it would be to part ; again from Walter, should she indulge her wish to see him. : Once again subject to the spell cast upon her by his voice and : i eyes, would she have strength to resist him?

"Calm yourself, dear child!" said Elizabeth, tenderly, press-' ing her to her bosom, and stroking her soft hair. "I will not  let him come to you!

So be it; I obey her behest ;" and mounting his horse, which stood ready saddled, he drove the spurs into his flanks, and dashed past the house without even raising his eyes to her window. "What sound is that?" exclaimed Annette, starting to her feet as the horse's hoofs fell upon her ear; and staggering to the window, she looked out just in time to catch a glimpse of horse and rider, as they passed out of the gate. "Walter! Walter!" she shrieked, stretching out her arms in the direction he had gone, " come back to me; O my darling, come back! I will go with you now, anywhere you may say!" but Walter was far beyond the reach of her voice. "He is gone! he is gone!!" she moaned, tottering into Elizabeth's arms, as she hastily came towards her. "I have seen him for the last time! Now let me die!" "No! no!" said Elizabeth, supporting her frail form; "you shall not die, my child! You must live to be his com- fort in the years to come!" but Annette shook her head sadly, repeating: "I shall never see him again!" Walter's banishment did not have the effect on Annette that was expected. Either she grieved too deeply for him, or, all necessity for self-restraint being over, she gave up to her real weariness; for from the day he left her health failed .rapidly. All was done for her that love could suggest; yet each day she lost strength, and seemed to be so many steps nearer the end of her journey.              .   / Doctor Wallis was sent for at last, as consulting physician, but without Annette's knowledge; for she dreaded the presence -   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        365 of strangers unacquainted with her story, who naturally might not sympathize with her sorrow. The doctor came, under the name of friend, however, but her disease baffled him so completely, from his ignorance of the cause of her illness, that Elizabeth found it necessary to admit him to her confidence. The good man was overwhelmed by distress when he heard the tale of Annette's woes, saying, sadly: "It would have been better for the child had she stayed with me. Her heart is broken, madam, and the Great Physician of souls alone can heal it! Why not send for a clergyman?" Elizabeth had thought of this before, but knew not for whom to send- Mr. Stone being out of the question -and Herbert Wellesley still absent. At the doctor's suggestion, however, she wrote to Herbert, telling him how very ill Annette was, and asking him to come and see her. Herbert lost no time on the Way, after this summons reached him. He had heard through his mother what had befallen Annette, but with true delicacy had hesitated to inflict himself upon her, lest his presence should distress her. Now, however, he hastened to P--, and presented himself before her imme- diately on his arrival. He, like all others who saw her for the first time since her trouble, wasdeeply affected at the great change that had taken place in her. Silently he stood beside her chair, holding her wasted hand in his, and gazed on the wreck before him, vaguely wondering if it were not years instead of months since he had last seen- her. "How very kind .you are-to come and see me,'; said Annette. "I am very lonely sometimes, thus confined to my room."  "I cannot express the sorrow it gives me to find you thus!" 3I1  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC8179-00000181"/> 366         ANNETTE; OR, replied Herbert, in a voice full of feeling, as he took his seati beside her. "Have you been ill long??" I Yes! no!" replied Annette, wearily. ' I cannot tell! It seems a long time since I was well and happy; but the days, if counted, are perhaps not many." "You must get well quickly now," said Herbert. "I have come home on a visit, but the time will pass slowly without my friend and companion. I shall not know what to do without you." "I shall soon be well!" said Annette; " that is, it will soon be well with me!" Herbert's heart beat rapidly with emotion at her words, the signification of which he understood but too well. "You must not allow yourself to become depressed," he said, "for the spirits in a great measure affect the health. Strive to look forward beyond this cloud that is overwhelming you! In the years to come your present suffering will have become as a troubled dream of the past, from which you have awaked to thank God that it is not true!" "What more is life?" replied Annette. "It is true, our bodies move and act, but which one of us can tell whither we go, or foresee the result of our simplest actions any clearer than we do in our sleep? Life is but a long dream!--and eternity is the awakening!" Herbert bowed his head, but made no answer. He was over- awed by the great change that had taken place in this once light-hearted girl. He had come to teach her, but she seemed years older than himself in experience. "Do not you speak to me of the future!" she continued, laying her transparent hand in his. "Look at me, and say if you really think there is any future for one as wasted as myself, in this world! Do not try to deceive me; I know that I am   THE CHRONICLES OF BELLEVUE.        367 dying; therefore let me have the luxury of talking unrestrainedly with you, at least." "You must not speak thus," said Herbert, looking with intense pain from the wasted hand to the delicate face, from which the hue of :health had forever disappeared. I cannot bear it. God grant that there be a long life in store for you!" (No! no!" she exclaimed. "God grant that I may go quickly to my rest! How could I bear to drag out my three- score years and ten in a world in which I have no place? Dis- honored! ruined! lost! let me hide my head in the grave!" Hush! hush!" exclaimed Herbert, pressing his quivering lips to the hand he held, whilst tears of anguish filled his eyes. "You shall not say such things about yourself! You have a place in the world, and one that no one' else can fill! Who could be to me the friend you are? and - think of Walter!" "Think of him!" exclaimed Annette, in a voice of agony. "Do I not do so all the day and all the night, although I know it to be wrong. Oh! what can I do with my love!" she, moaned. "He it was who gave it life i it wound itself around '"': him, clinging with many tendrils to his'heart, and now it must be torn away from the wall that sheltered it; for it is a sin to love him, since he is no longer mine!- My heart is broken!

You are mistaken 'though; for, alas! I have passed through the fire before you!" " "You?" ejaculated Annette, looking wonderingly at him. '"Yes, even myself!" he replied, with a sad smile. I once . loved, and with a love so deep and earnest that time can never change it! I thought I had taught my darling to return the feelings I cherished for her, and life seemed opening before me crowned with happiness! when, suddenly--before I had time to realize my fate - she was taken from me, and I was left'alone forever, the great love of my heart, like yours, astray, with no dwelling-place on'earth!" "Did she die?" asked Annette, in a low voice. "No! she married!" replied Herbert, ",and I spoke the words that parted us forever!" "How did you ever bear it?" said Annette. "It was very hard at first," replied Herbert. "It seemed almost too hard; but I schooled myself at length to witness my rival's happiness even with composure. I said to myself all that I have said to you, and added besides: ' Whilst there are so many of God's people fainting by the wayside, from the heat and burden of the day, it ill becomes me, His minister, to sit aloof and murmur at the lot He has seen fit to assign me.' So I rose up, and took my cross, as a gift from a loving Father, and meekly may I bear it to the end of my life, remembering always His words, who said: ' Could ye not watch with me one hour?" '" "I am so sorry for you!" said Annette, gently. "I never knew of this before!"  "Do not be sorry," replied Herbert, cheerfully; "for even now I am reconciled to my fate, and feel that it is for the best. O                    i   Through suffering I have learned to sympathize with others, as I never did before, and had my hopes been fulfilled, it may be that an earthly love would have usurped the throne of a heav- , enly one, and my heart remained where my treasure was upon  : the earth!"                        r "Your story is very sad," said Annette, "but my fate is worse than yours; for, at least, you know that the one you loved is happy, whilst with anguish, I remember that every pang I suffer finds echo in another's heart." "If she whom I love were happy," replied Herbert, "I    : could easily bear my own troubles; but she is not happy! and I am obliged to stand idly by, and watch her agony without the power of lightening her burden of a feather's weight!"! "Then, indeed, are you to be pitied and admired," replied Annette, sinking back thoughtfully in her chair.    '   :i "I do not court admiration," replied Herbert, with a smile,  rising to take his leave; "but if my experience has given you E any comfort, I am amply repaid for the effort it has been to tell my story to you.

But although her mind grew tranquil, Annette's physic condition became gradually more alarming, and, without an decided disease, she seemed to be slowly fading away. Da by day her strength failed; until, at the end of the month, sh was no longer able to rise without assistance, but was carries daily to her favorite seat beside the window, where she remained too weak to talk much, until evening, when she was carriec back  to  bed. Harrowing -as it was to Herbert to thus watch her gradual decline, he felt that it was an inexpressible cmfort to be able to remain with her to the last, and pitied Waiter, who would have given worlds to have been by her side. Annette never spoke of Waiter. She appeared to have for- gotten her own sorrows in those of others; for her ear was open to the smallest complaint, and with ready hand she lavished money on the poor. Herbert was her almoner; and, finding how  much comfort it gave her to do good, brought to her notice some new case for charity at every visit. I wish I could do something for you," she said, wistfully, to him one day. "It seems that the best friend I haveis the only one for whom I can do nothing. I should like to see you happy before I leave you."   THE CHRONICLES OF-BELLEVUEb.      371   :(!? "I am happy," replied Herbert; " that is, as much so as I shall over be in this world I "- "I do not like to hear you say that," replied Annette. "It sounds so sad; I should like to strew your path with roses, give you back your love, and secure your happiness forever, that when I am gone you might think of me with tender regret and . say: ' She was not ungrateful ' "a "It is not necessary for you to do anything to make me re- ; member you," replied Herbert. "I shall never cease to mourn you, should you leave me!" "But is your love still hopeless?-" inquired Annette. "How  fares it with her whom you love?" "Ask yourself!" replied Herbert, with deep emotion. "How- ; - fares it-now with you, my first and only love!" and, stooping, he kissed her hand. "Can this be true?" exclaimed Annette, raising herself from the pillows, " am I the one you have loved so dearly?- " "Even so!" replied Herbert, with quivering voice. "I -  have loved you more than my own happiness!' and I gave up  more than life when I married you too the man you loved!" fI "I am so grieved!"' said Annette, tenderly, laying her dis-'  engaged hand upon his bowed head. "Poor Herbert! how nobly you have acted, and how much I have made you suffer! -  "No! no!" said Herbert, " you have been all that is good - and kind to me! All that I have been able to do for you has brought its own reward in the pleasure it gave me to contribute.: in ever so small a way to your comfort, and my misery now, is  caused by the knowledge that there is nothing left to do!"  "But there is a great deal left to d o " said Annette. "Are  you not now my friend and comforter? What should I do!! without you?"

"God bless you, my friend and brother!"said Annette; and leaning towards him she kissed his forehead.       i And  now the tide of life ran out with frightful rapidity. Calmly and uncomplainingly she lay for a few brief days, so quiet that more than once her sorrowing friends thought she had already gone on her long journey!  She never again mentioned Walter's name. Her soul seemed free from all earthly thoughts, to be lost in communion with  Heaven. Once, indeed, she opened her eyes, saying softly and dreamily:  '"When I have gone to sleep, lay me beside my baby!  It will be lonely through the long winter night!"

"My darling, my wife, ? I am here! Where is she?" he continued, looking anxiously  around. "Why does she not come when I call?" and, before they had time to speak, he was off and up stairs.

The bed stood bare and Upright, no drapery nor covering upon it! 'Annette!" iow his voice had sunk to a whisper, as a dreadful fear came upon him! Ah! could the dead hear and move, Walter, she had been in your arms before now! "' Where is she?" he gasped, as he staggered back to the waiting group below. "Oh! give me my wife, for the love of God!" They gathered around him, in grief! They broke the sad news to him, as best they could!
