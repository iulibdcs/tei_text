TmE publisher flatters himself that he is now offer- ing to the reading public, a work of rare interest and surpassing excellence; abounding as it does, not only in profound and lofty thought, but also in beautiful and glowing imagery, bold metaphor, strik- ing figures and happy illustrations. Truth, attired in the drapery of symbolic lan- guage, figures and metaphor, is, sometimes thereby, rendered more attractive and alluring: this consid- eration evidently led to the production of the fol- lowing Allegory ;-in which, under the figure of a winged chariot is represented the Car of Progress emerging from a cloud of thick darkness, and a state of barbarism; thence taking its way through the earth, giving light and knowledge to all ages and nations. Undeniably, the Winged Chariot, is a gigantic production,--bearing the highest stamp of genius; and is destined to be regarded by every intelligent; reader as a priceless gem snatched by a master hand from the highest realms of thought. "    <pb n="4-v" xml:id="VAC5840-00000003"/> 4     THE PUBLISEH'S PREFACE.           e Besides the Allegory, this volume will be found to contain two other productions of sterling merit from the same gifted pen. The first is entitled: "The Way the World Goes." The second:  The Wheel of Fortune; or the Ups and Downs of Life." In these several works, which it has been deemed expedient to publish in one volume, is to be seen, not only the great powers of the author, but also the exceeding versitality of his pen-which is no less ready in scintillations of wit and humor, than  in the ponderous reflections born of sober reason. A. B. VOLNEY.   CHAPTER I THE blue sky was putting on dusky habiliments; the bright orb of day "had already dipped behind the western hills; and eventide was beginning to awe the world into stillness and quiet. In a pensive mood, I had sought a sequestered wood, not remote from the rural home of my childhood; and sat me down on a moss-grown spot at the foot of an ancient elm, giving my mind to gloomy meditations, and solemnly ponder- ing upon the present, past, and future. The history of centuries gone by, and the checkered annals of the human race, like a vast panorama, seemed to pass be- fore me,-while my heart grew sad and my thoughts sombre. At length, languidly reclining my weary head upon a spur of the venerable tree that overshad- owed me, I mused till gentle sleep unawares stole o'er my faculties, and in dreams I was carried back, far, far back, to ages past. Methought, that the ever moving wheels of time had suddenly reversed their motion, and in a twinkling rolled back many long, long centuries. "Itow wonderful is this!" thought I; from the womb of eternity the buried past is born again into time. The world how different! Men and things how strange they seem!"I marveled much, methought, and long; then I sighed, grew sad, and wept at what I saw. Rude and barbarous, appeared the age; ignor- v    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5840-00000004"/> 6      THE WINGED OHARIOT. ant and superstitious the race of men that multiplied upon the earth; war, rapine, and oppression, darkened and desolated the fairest portions of the globe, and the world was filled with loud lamShtations, wretched- ness and misery. Yet methought religion, (falsely so called,) had erected her numberless altars; provided her hordes of priests, her gods and demigods; and daily immolated her countless victims. On every hand were to be seen hideous images, and all manner of deities; here frowning idols stood to be worshipped; and there wrathy gods were waiting to be appeased. some were offered the blood of beasts; while others,  required human sacrifices. Though differing in rites and ceremonies, rethought, the various systems of religion, as understood and prac- ticed by their blind devotees, breathed the same spirit of intolerance, cruelty, and persecution. While the gods of different nations burned in wrath towards each other, the people, following the example of their gods, lived at enmity, hated and reviled one another; nation went to war with nation, tribe with tribe. Methought, as I gazed about, mine eyes chanced to light upon an ancient, stately, and gorgeously decorated fane, to which seemed repairing vast multitudes of worshippers ; by curiosity led, methought, I approached their altars, and paused to observe their devotions. For oblations, hu- man victims were chosen, and sinless infants fed the flame. Ah! what horror filled my soul! methought, when I beheld innocent babes, torn from the arms of weeping mothers, and given to torturing fires, to sat-t a   THE WINGED PHARIOT,       7 isfy the vengeance of vindictive deities. What wails of woe, what shrieks I methought I heard; what dread- ful moans pierced mine ears! Meanwhile, it seemed ferocious gods did gloat to see the helpless victims writhe 'mid cruel flames, and sometimes laughed out- right, to hear the frantic mother's loud lament. From this horrid sight, I shuddering, turned away; and bowing myself to the earth, exclaimed in my deep despair, "There is no hope! Superstition hath changed men into brutish beasts! nay, worse, turned them to demons. Alas! for wretched man, lost is he in a path- less wilderness of error-and who shall deliver him fi'om his blindness?" At this juncture, methought, I was approached by a Genii, who-in a kindly voice, bade me arise; then stretching forth his hand in which he held a magic wand, gently touched mine eyelids; and immediately I was endowed with miraculous power of vision, and was able at a glance, to survey the wide universe, and behold the transactions of men in every part of the earth. And I perceived that over all nations, ani in every land, reigned one perpetual, impervious, and unbroken night; dismal was the darkness, and fearful the gloom that enveloped humanity, and hung upon the future destiny of our race; cheerless, rayless, and starless, every sky --A feeling of utter despair again came over me; my heart grew faint, and I prayed for death; beseeching Heaven that I might find refuge in the grave from the dread scenes mine eyes were compelled to look upon. The Genii, perceiving my    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5840-00000005"/> 8b      THEim WOINGED CHARIOT. grief, now sought to console me, saying: "Despair not, there yet is hope; the heavens shall bend, and man will be redeemed! Celestial wisdom cometh down from above, and the portals of light are destined to be opened! Under this veil of ignorance, beneath the darkness and rubbish that crush the heart, and oppress the soul of humanity, there are thoughts that struggle, and fires that burn." "Ah, but can fiends be redeemed?"I asked, turn- ing, at the same time, a look of incredulity upon the prohecying spirit that stood by my side. "Believe me, son of mortality," responded the Genii, "men are but walking, and talking in their sleep-ay,  .; and in their sleep, plundering, tormenting, and mur- dering one another. The moral sensibilities being   : dead, vile passions rule the soul. But this moral death must have an end; and the deep sleep that turns ration-1 al man to a prowling beast shall be broken. There is. a voice to speak, and a light to shine forth that shall break the fatal spell, and rouse a slumbering world from its horrid dreams." Scarce had the Genii thus spoken, methought, when a sudden corrosocation of light, more dazzling than ere was noontide splendor, flashed upon my bewildered sight, electrifying all my powers, and mantling the  sky above me with a lustre, eclipsing, even the vivid glare of the auroraboralis. This startling phenome- na, as it seemed, was followed by the rumblingsound of chariot wheels; the trampling of steeds, and the cry of a great mulitude. / g-   THE WINGED CHARIOT.        9 "Now, behold," said the Genii, " the ushering in of a new era."  Turning about, I beheld, issuing from a cloud of thick darkness, a Winged Chariot, drawn by flying steeds, and encircled with a halo of golden light, reflec- ting from earth to heaven, and which increased every moment in splendor. Mingled emotions of delight, surprise, gratitude and rapture, now filled my heart; my spirit leaped for joy, and with wild enthusiasm, I hailed the glorious dis- pensation; so cheering seemed the advent of lightupon a night so dark, and a world so sad and drear. Hea- ven, methought, had come down to earth, and angels were descending and ascending. My admiration, most of all, was excited by the appearance of the charioteer, who seemed a beautiful virgin, wearing garments of purity, and clothed in sparkling habilaments that shone with more than diamond lustre. Her face was radi- enti as the sun, and her eyes were like the lightning. Laurels, plucked from the hills of immortality, encircled her brow, and the bright morning star glittered in her coronal; her voice was melody, and her gestures elo- quence. Bravely erect she stood, reining with con- summate skill her milk-white steeds, that swept on like a tempest-sometimes touching the earth; some- times scaling the mountains; then anon, bounding away high in air, and careering above the clouds! At the side of the virgin, stood a noble youth, gazing proudly aloft,-his kindling eye seeming to pierce the heavens, penetrate the veil of the hidden fature,-and    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5840-00000006"/> TO      THE WINGED CHARIOT. even to scan very immensity. With one hand raised in sublime and meaning gesture, he seemed to say: "Onward and upward 1"In the other, he held a staff, from the apex of which floated a snowy banner, bear- ing in bold relief, this sublime inscription: "Progress! Eternal progress Reform! Excel- sior!" After sufficiently recovering from my astonishment,   - "Pray," said I to the Genii, " what may this mean?  I beseech thee kind spirit, instruct me." "That is the car of progress," the Genii replied, " the work of reform, is already begun; look now for great commotions, and the transpiring of mighty events." "Pray," said I again, "tell me, who is that lovely virgin, in queenly attire, and whose lily fingers the silvery reigns entwine?" "Her name is Wisdom," answered my instructor, ' a goddess of great renown,-yet known, loved, and worshipped by few upon the earth. By her side, you behold bright eyed Genius, whom she inspires with prudence, hope and courage. The milk-white steeds, harnessed to the Winged Chariot, are called, Truth and Reason, Tnowledge and Virtue." ' They are very beautiful,"I observed, "and seem 3aparisoned in su ans, and draped in heaven's own  purple light." /  "And powerful as they are beautiful," said the Genii.  Tis the office of Wisdom," he continued, "to guide  he flying coursers, while soaring Genius unfurls the  wnowy banner, and exhibits in their most attractive    THE WINGED C(IIABIOT,      1 forms the treasures of knowledge, and the excellence and fadeless beauties of trtth and reason. The mighty words emblazoned upon the unsullied banner, are pro- phetic, and proclaim to all nations the glorious mission of the car of Progress. They are traced in characters of light, that every eye may see and read them." "And why,"I enquired, "hath the chariot wings as well as wheels?" "Because," responded the Genii, "it must needs fly through the air, as well as roll upon the earth; for since the transgression of man, and the setting in of the long, dismal night that still overshadows this wretched world, the ravenous wolves of hell, have ceased not to prowl through the earth, seeking to devour the unwary, and mad to drink the blood of martyrs. Besides, the great Red Dragon, that cometh down from the City of the seven hills, constantly lieth in wait for the chil- dren of light. Moreover, there are yawning chasms, deep ravenes, dismal gulfs, and stupenduous mountains to overleap; therefore the Chariot hath wings as well as wheels." "Are not the immaculate steeds thereby inconveni- enced?" questioned I, still confounded and overwhelm- ed by the mystery of what I saw. "By no means," replied my patient instructor, "though possessing unconquerable energy, they are nevertheless of a nature so ethereal as to walk the sil very air with the same facility they tread the solid ground.", While the Genii, yet- spake, methought, the whole    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5840-00000007"/> 12    TTHE WINGED CHARIOT. earth shook; the mountains were displaced, the seas went mad, foaming with terrible wrath; and the up. tossed ocean lashed her rocky shores with ten-fold fury! Ay, and fierce lightnings, rent the air; bellowing thunders startled the very dead in their grave and fiery clouds, like chariots of war, seemed driving reck- less through the sky! And now, the temples of idolatry, with their graven images, and gods of clay, brass and iron, began to quake, and all the antiquated fabrics of political and religious despotism, began to totter and to tumble down; while priests and prelates stood aghast, and kings and tyrants trembled on their throne. As the chariot advanced, it seemed to expand, and its velocity to accelerate; while the redeemed multi- plied in its train. The-slumbering nations, were now startled from their dreams; and awaking, were struck with amazement, and stood gazing in stupid wonder, till a race of gloomy monks taking sudden alarm, broke from their dens and caves, and running in breathess haste, lustily cried: "Stop that car! stop that car!" At this, methought the Genii smiled; and so ludi- crous was the appearance and conduct of the terrified monks, I myself was provoked to laughter. "And now behold," said the Genii, "Hell rages, and the sons of perdition come forth!" I looked-and lo, there followed a bustling gang of officiating clergy, who frothed, raged, cursed, and tore   THE WINGED CHARIOT,       13 their robes; and lifting up their hands in pious horror cried: "Our holy religion is profaned! Strike down that banner! Accursed be he that dares defend it " The Druids, and the iag9i, though hardly so voci- ferous, were none the less exasperated. Moved by deadly malice, and excited to diabolical fury, all poured out their anathemas upon the new dispensation and the heralds of reform; bitterly protesting against inno- vation, the introduction of new ideas, and new theories. The princes and potentates of the earth, roused like lions from their lair by the hue and cry, and now tak- ing courage, joined in the general clamor; and utter- ing terrible imprecations, cried with stentorian voices- "To hell with the car of progress! To the deepest hell with the banner that waves over it! Accursed be he that beareth it; and every soul that enlisteth under its folds! Damned be they who say reform ! By this, the brainless rabble got their cue, and furi- ously echoed the curses which fell from reverend and royal lips. Like brutish beasts, they rushed forward at the bidding of their masters, ferociously assailing the friends of progress, and whoever was seen wearing the badge of reform. Madly seizing the winged char- iot, they essayed by violence, at once to overthrow and demolish it. A mighty warfare, now ensued; fearful was the struggle; and for a while, seemed a dubious conflict. All the powers of darkness, rallied to the support of ignorant despotism; the great Red Dragon, roared and raged; and the blind herd of animal men,    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5840-00000008"/> "     THE WINGED CHARIOT. filled with fanaticism, fought with desperation. But they contended against immortal truth, the law of progress, and the cause of reform: these held a charm- ed life; and though crushed to earth, were destined to rise again. With one hand, the gigantic power of re- form, warded the wicked blows of her infuriate foe; while with the other, she went on demolishing the superstructures of error, subverting empires of dark- ness, and sweeping down the ramparts of hell in her course. Methought, there issued from the chariot, flaming swords, that flashed amid the smoke of battle, like the glare of falling meteors; and they cut in every direction, slaying on the right, and on the left. At length as it appeared, hell wrought to phrensy, and led on by howling demons, made a final desperate charge: for a space, terrible seemed the clash of arms, and the din of battle; then came a deafening sound, as if the rock-ribbed globe had- burst asunder: and in a moment, profound darkness enveloped all. At this, a pang worse than that of death, ran through my soul; for methought, the cause of Heaven was lost, righteous- -ness overthrown, and the last ray of hope had perished. But now, suddenly, as in creation's morn, when sun from chaos ascending, burst in glory upon the new born world, so broke the light of Heaven upon the dreadful pill that for an instant, had o'er spread the battle field, on which were met in deadly strife, the powers above, and the powers below. Each I saw contending still, and with might and main, striving for the mastery; but perdition had already received   THE WINGED CHARIOT.       15 a fatal blow; and in a moment more, the cry, "vic- tory! victory!" rang out from the battalions that fought on the side of progress and reform. The gal- lant and brave charioteer, now grasping her reins with firmer hand, put to their utmost strength and speed, hei milk white steeds; and Genius rising upon his-tiptoes, proudly waved his snowy banner; ever and anon, shouting with trumpet tongue--"Progress! Reform! Excelsior! ' Triumphant, over the heads of kings and clergy; and in spite of hell, and opposing millions, the victori- ous chariot rolled on, while still its burnished wheels and glittering pinions, chased darkness from its path- way through earth and sky. How I enjoyed, this triumph My bosom throbbed with ecstacy; and at the top of my voice, I echoed the shout of "victory I " But ah! 'how quickly my enthusiasm was changed to melancholy, when I turned to surve:ythe ensan- guined field of battle, which seemed a gory plain of vast extent, covered with the dying and the dead. I perceived that many intrepid, many noble spirits had fallen there. Valiantly had they fought for truth and contended for the right; but overpowered by brute force, had been hurled to the ground; some slain at the instant, while others, spared but for a more cruel' fate, were straightway dragged before ecclesiastical courts, summarily condemned, and X heartlessly sen- tenced to torture and to death.  I now in my despondency, invoked the Genii; who    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5840-00000009"/> 16      THE WINQED CiTARIOT. in a moment appeared by my side. "Pray," said I "good Genii, what shall be the end of all this ?" "These things must needs be," he gravely responded; "that truth and righteousness may triumph, and the reign of peace be established. Ere humanity is re- deemed from the bondage of sin and error, the earth must be drenched in blood." "And has Heaven ordained it to be so?"I question with a sigh. "- Nay verily;" replied my instructor, "it is the great wickedness of man that maketh it a dire necessity. Many of the good and virtuous among men, many brave, and many mighty shall fall by murderous hands  but the cause of reform, shall know no defeat; the course of the car ofprogress shall be forever onward; the charioteer that guides it, the standard-bearer, and the milk white steeds, shall pass unscathed and un- harmed, ever waxing stronger and stronger, fleeter and fleeter. Now behold you," continued the Genii, "the flying chariot going forth in the majesty of its strength, and describing the circle of the whole earth, still dif- fuising light and knowledge in its course." I looked, and lo! a spectacle of surpassing grandeur and sublimity, met my admiring gaze: blazing through benighted lands, through chaotic elements, frowning clouds, whirlwind and howling tempest-on, and on sped the chariot, sweeping o'er land and sea; some- -times its wheels rolled in fire; sometimes in blood; then on dark and surging billows tossed; anon, riding on the winds of the wind, and gliding upon the   Xi   -    THE WiaibnECHARIOT.      17 fretted bosom of the itorimi:loud, in mighty circle. wheeling, round - and roundd the wide world it flew. Where it touchld the ground, methought the earth quaked, and the hills and valleys around, were strange- ly convulsed. Yet I observed methought, immediately thereafter, a delightful calm ensued: clouds and dark- ness passed away; the air became pure and balmy; the hills and mountains were made green; the valleys fruitful, the wilderness blossomed, and the solitary pla- ces were made glad. In the meantime, I perceived there were vast sections over which the winged char- iot glided at an immense altitude; producing no visi- ble effect, leaving-not: a discernable trace behind. Tiis at first, I understood not, and besought the Genii to explain. "Darkness so dense," replied the spirit, "can not at once be penetrated by the arrows of light; 'twill require centuries to dissipate the thick night and dis- mal gloom that encompass these miserable regions. The great designs of Heaven in this dispensation, are not to be consummated in a day. Wisdom is patient, truth and reason untiring; fear not, the winged char- iot whose goings forth you behold, .and whose mission I   is to all nations, will roll on till every land is enlight- ened, and all tribes, kindreds, and tongues are re- deemed, and the whole earth is made a paradise." Now methought, I began to comprehend more fully the philosophy of reform, the workings of the law of    progress, and the nature and scope of the mighty movement which I beheld going forward with such    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5840-00000010"/> rls TaTu WINGGED CAARIOT. trium h. I perceived that this great work in man's behalf, was intended, not to advance and 'elevate him in any one direction merely, but in many directions; nay, to improve his powers, and ameliorate his condi- tion in every respect. I'saw it contemplated the prop- er unfolding and ffill. development of man in all things  the maturing and perfecting of his faculties, his ad- vancement morally, physically, and intellectually. Whik religious reformation', was it seemed, the 'lead- ing aim, yet manifestly, the guiding power in the 'glo- rious dispensation, looked not singly to this ; but sought to bring about universal reform, and a thorough en- lightefiment of the race, teaching mankind to be good. wise, and happy,.   C HAPJTER 11. TuF.'.WNlV again to the Genii, I begged to be instruct- ed more fully in the law ofprogrmss and in the nature of eternal ucnfoldings. Manifesting a willingness to comply, he bade me follow him. I obeyed, and straightway' was led ffiroughi a desolate and dreary region, to the foot of a great mountain; there pausing, my companion bade me ob- serve the sterility and utter barrenness of the place' I looked, and it was so: the ground appeared fruitless, "flowerless, lea-fless; pale was the light, and oppressive the air; nor was there aught within mv compass of of vision to relieve the eye, or break the dread mono- tony that reigned, on all sides round. A fueling of utter desolation came over -me; and I was about to sink down in despair, when the Genii' bade me look up. Then lifting my eyes, I beheld what seemed an inter- I minable acclivity, mountain on mountain piled, pierc- ing the clouds, and lost to the view far away in the dizzy regions of the upper sky. The base ofthe moun- tain appeared rocky, rough, and unsightly; while far upits sides ere stupenduous jutting ledges; over- hanging granite, and huge stones that looked frown- ingly down upon me, and seemed to cut off all ho e of ascent. Just above the rough unbeautifuil objects that intervened, mine eyes rested, upon a green spot, where grew fi-uits and flowers of, exquisite beauty, and I dig-    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5840-00000011"/> 20      THE WINGED CHARIOT. cerned also the sparkle of a welling fountain, delight- ful to look upon. The Genii now addressing me, said: "When thou hast climbed this mountain, thou shalt something more comprehend of eternal progress." Thus saying, my spirit guide leaped forth, and with alacrity run up the mountain's rugged side-bidding me at the same time, follow him. Up, and up, he glided like a flying shadow, till in the distance he dis- appeared from my sight. With feeble, faltering steps, I essayed to follow; and with faint hopes of success began to ascend the mountain. Up frightful steeps, and o'er jaggy rocks, I slowly clambered, sometimes loosing my course, and ever and anon bewildered amid brambles, fogE; and seemingly endless labyrinths into which, oft -uawares I wandered; then retracing my erring steps, would again begin the difficult ascent. On and on I went, surmounting obstacle after obstacle, till at length, faint and weary, I reached a green and gentle slope, in the midst of which, a little gurgling stream gushed from the mountain side; while here and there, was to be seen a tempting cluster of deli- cious fruits and fragrant flowers. I drank of the cool crystal waters, and quenched my thirst; I ate of the good fiuit, and satisfied my hunger. Immediately thereafter, I received strength; and was able with new life and energy, to resume my journey up the moun- tain. With infinitely greater facility I now ascended; upward, and upward, mounting with ever increasing   THE WINGED CHARIOT.        21 alacrity. What at first seemed a task, at length proved my delight. At each successive step as I ascended I breathed more freely, inhaled a purer air, the; climate growing more salubrious, the scenery more enchanting, fruits more plentiful, and more delicious; greener appeared the foliage, and brighter the flowers; and every new prospect that burst upon my view, seemed more transporting than the preceding. Although having ascended as it appeared, above the clouds, darkness, and inclemency of lower earth, my soul seemed to expand, and my whole nature to vivify and etherialize. And now tinkling rills, sparkling brooks, gushing founts, and verdant groves, perpetu- ally greeted my eyes; birds of brightest plume, and sweetest song, charmed mine ears. After a time, paus- ing a moment in my course, I gazed upwards, survey- ing with enraptured vision, the vast expanse of varie- gated acclivity, presenting ineffable pictures of beauty, grandeur, and sublimity, till my heart overflowed with gratitude, to the great creator who had made all things so glorious. Never before, methought, had. I so fully felt the power of contrast, nor so adequately conceived the beauty and wisdom ofprogress. Rising perpetu- ally from the less perfect to the more perfect, I perceived. how new springs of delight were awakened, and new fountains of joy constantly opened in the heart. Kind ling with fiesh enthusiasm, and filled with ecstacy, I again sallied forth, eager to explore still higher regions and sublime realms. Bending still mine. eyes aloft as I ascended, I chanced to espy my truant Genii, stand.    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5840-00000012"/> 22      TH WINGED CHARIOT. ing on what seemed the very pinacle of the vast accli- vity. The dizzy eminence he occupied, looked a rosy summit, bathed in light celestial. Cheered by the enchanting prospect, and animated with the hope of again joining my spirit guide, and of standing by his side on the mountain top, I darted up methought, with the agility of the antelope; from slope to slope, and from eminence to eminence, I ran with increasing cele- rity, till at length I soared, it seemed, like the mountain eagle; and after a mighty sweep through the yielding air, alighted beside the Genii, who welcomed my pres- ence, but smiled at my disappointment; for I found that instead of having gained the mountain top, I had but reached an eminence which formed as it were, but the base to another mountain, loftier still. "Pray child of earth," inquired the Genii, " what clouds thy brow? Is not thy toil repaid? Shall thy spirit droop in such an Eden as this? Look around thee upon this radiant spot; what a contrast to the rocky desert and barren waste thou sawest at the foot of the mountain! On every hand behold the pleasing prospects and glowing landscapes! Look upon these beautiful bowers, and those delightful forests, robed in living green! and these silvery streams that meander through them. See the golden fruits, running vines, and fragrant blossoms that perfume the breeze. And let thine ears drink in the sweet melody of these birds of paradise. Beside, are not all thy powers strength- ened and improved by the exertion called forth in climbing this mount of progress? Is not thy mind   THE WINGED CHARIOT.       23 more brilliant? thy soul more active thy body more vigorous? Art thou not better, wiser, happier?" "'Tis even so, good Genii,"I readily confessed; "but I had thought to find here the mountain's gilded summit; instead thereof, I behold vast acclivities still rising before me." "Ay! thou shalt ever ascend, but never come to the end;" anwered he. "The mount of progress, is inter- minable as space, and endless as the years of eternity. This know thou is the meaning of Eternal Progress. And 'tis the great duty of mn to aid and foster this law of his nature; for thereby he glorifies God, pro- motes his own happiness, and answers the true end of his being." 'Ay! ay!" my heart responded, "I now comprehend." "All along thy journey upwards in the path ofprog- ress, resumed the Genii, "new beauties, new joys, new delights, new glories, shall greet thee! Not even with thy mortal life, shall thy journey cease; for when the clay tenement dissolves, then will thy freed spirit, with infinitely greater facility, climb the shining way of pogress. Clothed upon with powers and faculties, requiring and destined to eternal progression, thou shalt learn is a happy condition of thy being; but for contrast and comparison, which mainly depend on progress, there could be no appreciation of the good, the true, nor the excellent. Beholdest thou not the law ofprogress in all things? It lies at the very-founda- tion of thy being; runs through all nature, extending from the hights above to the depths below; pervades    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5840-00000013"/> -24     TmE WNGED CHARIOT. the heavens, the earth, matter and spirit. Matter ever refines; spirit ever etherializes; and the tendency of a universal being is onward, onward, onward, and -upward." Having thus spoken, the Genii suddenly vanished; the great mountain disappeared, and in a moment I sank down to the plain I had previously occupied. What I had just seen and heard, left a deep and vivid impression on my heart; and greatly increased my solicitude for the enlightenment of mankind, and the ultimate success of the cause of reform. I rejoiced to see that the winged chariot still held on its way; ay! and with increasing power and growing splendor! With pleasure, I perceived it had already wrought mighty changes in the earth; and that the world was fast becoming wiser and better. Under the benign influence of its light, 'twas apparent, man was losing his ferocity, laying aside his barbarous customs, and becoming humanized, civilized, and enlightened. A spirit of inquiry seemed rapidly spreading abroad; and apostles of reform were here and there rising up, and such as were ready, if need be, to lay down their lives for the sake of truth. Among the leading spirits of the age, who joyfully hailed the car of progress, I observed a noble looking youth, whose thoughtful mein, and dignified air, deep- ly interested me. "There," said I to myself, "is a mind that looks beyond the present moment; ay, that peering through the darkness of the times, sees the tops of distant   THE WINGED CHARIOT.       25 thoughts, and the shadows of coming events."Wrap- ped in profound meditation, he sat alone, underneath a vine-clad arbor. While I stood contemplating the youthful philosopher, methought his abstracted air, chanced to draw upon him the attention of two passers by; who pausing to regard him, thus spake one to the other: "Softly Foscari; here's that mysterious man Galileo." "Mysterious? Why mysterious, Alnomer?" returned the individual addressed. "Neither day nor night giveth he rest to his labor- ing thoughts." "A wonderful thinker, eh?" "And an untiring student. Few things, I conjec- ture, that mortals may know, lie beyond the reach of his mighty mind." "Ay! I dare say. See how lost in his thoughts." "Oft I've seen him wandering alone in the silent hours of the night, with his upturned gaze rivitted upon the high heavens, as if holding mysterious converse with the stars." "How fixed his eyes! Methiuks I almost fear to look upon him;" said Foscari, drawing back, and turning pale, from superstitious apprehensions. "May i:h  he not be a wizard 2" added he, with increasing trepi- dation. "Poh! a wizard!" replied Alnomer, contemptuously and in a sarcastic tone. "Hist! he speaks," added he, as Galileo rose to his feet, speaking to himself, still unconscious of being observed. 3    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5840-00000014"/> 26      THE WINGED CHARIOT. "It, must be so; the earth moves, and with what velocity!" soliloquised Galileo, as he walked away, abstractedly bending his eyes on vacancy. "He's mad! the fellow's mad!" exclaimed Foscari. "The earth moves, did he say?" "I'm sure he did. Can he mean the great world we stand upon?" "What else can his words signify?' "Now I remember by the way, the tongue of report doth tell of a strange theory which this same Galileo, hath of late conceived, concerning the earth and hea- vens: and touching which 'tis averred, he once dis- coursed to certain of his pupils, setting their young minds greatly upon the marvel." "And pray what claims he to know of the earth and heavens, more than we do?" "As I understand his theory runs some how thus: The earth is round, and rolls round from west to east causing alternate day and night." "Round? ha! ha! ha! with half an eye, any man can see 'tis flat. Ah! 'tis plain, the fellows's mad. Some evil spirit it may be, hath put this same thing into his head, and thereby cracked his brain. Monks and Gray Beards, tell of wandering Goblins, War- locks and witches, that are wont to do such things." "Pshaw! pshaw! Galileo's no cracked brain; rely on that."  "At all events, his theory's most absurd, as any child may see. Who does not know that the rising and setting of the sun causes day and night?"   --;,     THET WINGED CHARIO.       27 "The going of the sun, he maintains, is but appa- rent, not real." "Then is not our existence real--only apparent. Besides, if the world runs according to his silly no- tion, I marvel we do not all lose our footing, and tum- ble the Lord knows where!" "But there's a law in nature, he affirms, called the attraction of gravitation, by the force of which we and all other objects upon the earth's surface, are held secure. "Nonsense! nonsense! set him down for a madman." "Indeed I must own, it's very like madness. Yet, some there are, who make bold to say his theory com- mends itself to their reason." "They are mad as he. That the world stands still, any man can see who hath eyes, or if he have none, can feel it does not go." "Galileo doth likewise teach, that the earth hath also another motion, an annual revolution round the sun; which causes the seasons, and brings forth winter and summer; seed time and harvest." "Wilder, and wilder I I must reckon every man a lunatic, who listens to his ravings." At this juncture, methought a morose, wrinkled vis- aged, cadaverous looking man, wearing the garb of a monk, approached the talkers. "Father Calvari," said Foscari, "I would that thou had'st been here a moment sooner." "Wherefore, my son?" demanded the monk in se- jj pulchral tones, much in keeping with his tombstone face.    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5840-00000015"/> 28      THE WNGED CHARIOT. "Knowest thou a young man named Galileo?" asked Foscari. "Have seen him;" answered Calvari," though not oft. I like him not; he thinks too much, a dangerous thing." "Ay! ay! father Calvari; and offends Heaven no less than it pleases Satan." "Thou art verily right my son. This same Galileo, hath an impious craving for knowledge, and an un- godly boldness in searching out hidden mysteries. 'Tis even rumored of him, that led on by the Devil, he hath of late, fallen into a most dangerous heresy." "No marvel; but knowest thou the complexion of his heresy " "'Tis affirmed, with what truth I know not, that he insanely ascribes motion to the earth." "That he is verily guilty of holding such an opinion, both Alnomer and I, are ready to testify. For even within the present hour with our own ears, we over- heard him in discourse to himself, utter words of like purport to that wherewith he is charged." "Then he must be reported; and if need be, brought before the holy Inquisition. "Alnomer, art thou also ready to bear testimony against the heretic?" "Your pardon, father Calvari: what though Galileo be in error respecting his novel theory? the heresy cannot be reckoned damnable; his opinions, touching the motions of the earth, you must allow can be fraught with no great mischiefeither to church or state." ^v5N   TmE WINGED CHARIOT.       29 "Thou speakest not wisely Alnomer; new ideas dis- turb and agitate men's minds; and old opinions once unsettled, may fall to pieces like ropes of sand, and in downright infidelity end. Against so dire an evil to guard, 'tis needful all change of opinion to prevent." "Such a policy, may check the advancement of the  human mind; but will not prevent the world from moving, if indeed it hath a motion, and Galileo chance to be in the right." "Better, far better, that the earth even, were removed from its place, than that the minds of men should be jostled from their ancient pedestals. "Come Foscari, go with me; thou shalt have the profit and honor of being informant. Galileo must be taught to tread with more caution upon forbidden ground." And the two departed in company, leaving Alnomer alone; who, after a moment's silent reflection, solilo- quised thus:- "Superstition, thou inexorable, dark, and cruel mon- ster, I execrate thee 1 An enemy to freedom of thought thou puttest the rational mind in chains; ay! thou dost imprison truth, and interdict the tree of knowl- edge; and the car of progress, thou delightedest to impede in its course.

The dread hour, at length arrived; andI beheld the noble youth brought before the sable court, to answer for his novel and strange opinions respecting the mo- lions of the earth. With manly boldness, the young astronomer stood up before his accusers, inquisitors and judges,-to speak in his own defense; and with mighty argument began to make plausible his new theory; but in the midst of his eloquent speech was ordered to be silent. Then I percieved that bigotry had no ears for the    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5840-00000019"/> 36      TilE WINGED CHARIOT. voice of reason; and that the eyes of ignorance were incapable of discerning truth. "Prepare the fire, and bring forth the instruments of torture ;" said the chief inquisitor, "if the heretic renounce not," continued the tyrant, " he shall burn." The faggots began to blaze; and the cruel instru- ments of torture were paraded before the accused. The dauntless youth, now for the first, grew pale; and as he looked upon the kindling fire, a shudder ran through his frame, and he was seized with a sudden trembling-quaking, as if his very joints would part assundert "Say, Galileo," demanded the inquisitor, "adherest thou still to thine opinions?" "I renounce them all;" answered, the accused, in faltering accents, and with downcast look. "Solemnly, and upon your knees, renounce them forever."Was the stern command of the spiritual judge. Reluctantly kneeling, the proud youth humbled him- self, to kiss the dust at the feet of abhor'd ignorance and bigotry-outwardly renouncing what he inwardly felt to be true. Going out from fhe presence of the tribunal, Gali- leo paused:-a moment pressed the ground with his foot, and to himself said: "I've renounced-but the world goes still." Then, dashing away, with his wonted buoyancy of spirit, he directly overtook the Winged Chariot, and joined again the phalanx of progress and reform.   THE WINGED CHARIOT.        37 "How is it Galileo, you still wear your head?" said one. ' Having further use for so convenient an article," facitiously replied Galileo, "I deemed it wise not to surrender it to brute beasts, when 't was to be saved by a mere breath of words." "To save thy life, thou hast then denied the truth." "By denying it, I live to fight for it." Saying which, he snatched the snow-white banner from the hand-of genius, and proudly waving it, shout ed aloud: "Progress! Eternal progress! Reform! Excelsior!" On dashed the Winged Chariot; swift rolled its glit- tering wheels ; fleeter than the wind sped the milk white steeds ;-again the earth shook; muttering thun- ders were heard in the distance; and the mighty ele- ments of creation were thrown into fearful commo- tion! But far above the tempest that rocked the earth and heavens, and the dismal darkness that hung like a pall upon the strugling nations, the bright morning star appeared, giving promise of a better and happier day. '.i    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5840-00000020"/> CHAPTER III. Through the lapse of centuries, I had watched with intense interest the progress of the Winged Chariot; and beheld with unspeakable satisfaction its brilliant triumphs and mighty achievements. A resplendent halo, stretching from horizon to horizon, marked its course; and every time it swept round the circle of the earth its path of light grew more luminous; and un- dulating waves of golden radiance spread out over the nations, pouring sunshine into all hearts and minds that were open to receive it. While I gazed upon this spectacle, the Genii, whom I had long lost sight of, surprised me by his sudden reappearance. "Son of mortality," said he, "art thou yet convinced that my prophecy is to be fulfilled ." "I am convinced ;" responded I, "the law of pro- gress, I perceive, is eternal; its power and glory I've witnessed; and now am I fully assured that the Cha- riot is destined to roll eternally onwards, ever work- ing out the grand and glorious designs of heaven." "But now mark me," rejoined the spirit, "thy con- fidence is about to be shaken, and thy faith staggered." "How can that be?" I marveled within myself, while I turned a look of amazement upon the Genii. "Now behold you," he said, pointing to the flying car which was gliding with great celerity through the most enlightened portion of christendom, "see that xxxviii   "      Jla"-HE WINGED CHARIOT.      39 dark, portentuous cloud that gathers about the Chariot, and stretches across its track of light." I looked; and lo, a tumultuous throng of enthusi- asts and fanai' s, who had just put on the badge of re- form, were rusing wildly upon the Winged Chariot, mad to make known their zeal, and to render them- selves conspicuous in reforming the world. "While they are the professed friends of progress," declared the Genii, "they will prove its greatest ene- mies. Ah, see, the new converts in their rashness have already compelled the Chariot to halt in its triumphal career." And it was so; ay, and in their folly the brainless fanatics reproached the charioteer, and uttered loud complaint against-the flying steeds.  ;  "The car moves tardily." Cried one. "The steeds are puny." Averred another. =v  "The work of reform they make not thorough." Protested still an other. "How can they thus complain?"I asked, "when so wonderous, and so glorious a change hath already been wrought in the earth?" "'Tis the voice of fanaticism," replied the Genii, "that never is heard to speak the- words of truth and soberness. Fanatics are impatient, precipitent and blind. You can scarce have failed to perceive that from the moment the Winged Chariot issued from the cloud of darkness which had hitherto obscured it, light has been shed upon the benighted of earth as fast as  the feeble eyes of the mind were capable of receiving I    a eneduo h  eigtdo atha ata     <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5840-00000021"/> 40      TIIE WINGED CIARIOT. it. But those mad enthusiasts, would have the work of reform consummated in a day; and eternal progress to run its course by the setting of the sun." And now the cry was raised: "Let the flying steeds be dismissed, that we ourselves may be harnessed to the car." At this,Wisdom, rising to her feet, gravely expos- tulated with the clamorous multitude; but they re- mained deaf to every rational appeal. "We are the men," they cried, "to fight the battles of reform. Commit the cause to us, and leave the chariot of progress in our hands." "Then shall you see the fruits of your folly ;" re- plied Wisdom, "let those mad men be harnessed to the car ;" she added, resigning her post, and retiring in disgust, followed by her sister spirits. Now a great contention arose among the fanatics as to who should work in the lead. Fierce was the dis- putation; and each aspirant urged his claims with clamorous tongue,-and speeches loud and long. It was finally decided that each man's tongue should be measured, and that he who was found to have the long- est should lead the van. Wisdom, though standing aloof, was not wholely inattentive to what passed ; hear- ing this singular proposition, she sighed inwardly, and whispered to herself: "Better measure brain than tongue." But to measuring tongues they went. The result was, Mr. Crackbrain, whose unruly member proved to be of greatest length, was declared leader. All being at length harnessed, with break-neck speed   THE WINGED CsaRIOT.       41 they scampered away like unbridled asses. Not far had they gone, when some got out of wind; and others becoming alarmed, began to kick up, and protest against going a-head at such a rate. Dire confusion ensued,-and the chariot was brought to a sudden stop by being upset. A ludicrous scene was here pre- sented: each blamed the other,-and all had got their legs out of the traces. After much wrangling and angry disputation, 'twas decided that Crackbrain be - '  deposed, and Mr. Ignoramus made leader in his stead. This change, however, proved of no advantage; for Ignoramus' eyes being situated in the back of his head, he was'nt long knocking his own brains out, and breaking the necks of all his followers by plunging headlong over a precipice. "By this catastrophe," remarked the Genii, "the world gains more than it has lost; for wild enthusiasts, and reckless fanatics, invariably do more harm than good to whatever cause they espouse."   I observed now a more judicious and sober minded class of men come forward and take charge of the Winged Chariot. Though not free from the shackles of bigotry and superstition, they seemed, nevertheless '1:  to be among the most enlightened of the age, and to have some tolerable conception of the nature of pro- :,1': gress and the philosophy of reform. Perceiving there was now a gleam of hope, Wisdom ,-,:  . drew near and sought to inspire these disciples with celestial illumination. But among them also sprung up questions that engendered dissension, division and    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5840-00000022"/> 42      THE TWNGED CHABIOT. strife. Each was anxious to carry with him his own favorite views touching theology, philosophy and science, to the exclusion of all antagonistic opinions entertained by others. Bitter controversies, and angry disputations now began; which, the longer they were protracted the fiercer they grew; Wisdom, now lifting up her voice, said: "Wave these matters, about which you ae not likely to be agreed, and with one accord push forward the car of progress." But alas, when. men's passions are aroused they sel- dom listen to the voice of wisdom. So it proved on this occasion; in angry discussions the great cause of man's advancement and elevation was lost sight of; yet upon returning to their sober senses they would for a time make common cause of progress and reform till some new question would come up, giving fresh occasion for division and wrangling. Especially did the new, and I might say, the uncertain sciences of Phrenology, Psychology, Mesmerism, Spiritualism, &amp;c. become fruitful subjects of dispute among the professed friends of progress. Some were for rejecting, and some for accepting these theories at once and without investigation. Others, more wise, recommended the ordeal of enlighted reason; and counseled caution, coolness and candor, both in receiving and in rejecting new things. But this advice was little heeded by rash and impetuous spirits, who had neither the capacity nor the patience for research and calm deliberation. The fanatics at length becoming impatient of all re-   WA-   THE WINGED CHARIOT.       43   istraint, broke loose from the phalanx of the more ju- diious and sober minded, and at once commenced a furious and indiscriminate war upon all venerable and long established institutions, tearing down and demo- lishing everything, and building up nothing. This ridiculous folly, ultraism, and madness, caused many who had worked well for a time in the harness of pro- gress, to become alarmed, and precipitantly abandon the cause. At this crisis, Wisdom again came forward; and with Genius by her side, once more resumed her post. -  The milk white steeds-Truth and Reason; Knowl- edge and Virtue, were again harnessed to the Chariot, which was soon in rapid motion. And now again, the genuine work of progress and reform went on with triumph; while from the battlements of heaven loud Hallelujas resounded, and the redeemed of earth raised a shout which caused hell to tremble, and brought down the chief pillars of the kingdom of darkness.  At this juncture,-and in a state of intense excite- ment, I awoke; and instantly rising, bent homeward my steps, deeply impressed with the strangeness of my :: w  vision. And up to the present hour have I been un- able to shake off the conviction that it was something more than a dream, in     <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5840-00000023"/>   THE WAY THE WORLD GOES: A STORY.

"A thought strikes me, Orlando;" said George Fleetwood, addressing his companion, a young carpen- ter, laboring at the bench by his side. "A thought strikes me ;" he repeated with emphasis; and tossing aside the implement he was using, wiped the teeming perspiration from his heated brow; then stepping back a pace or two, assumed an abstracted and thoughtful air, as is profoundly pondering the new idea which had just bolted into his mind. "A thought strikes you?' responded Orlando Haz- leton, facetiously; "impudent! thoughts are sometimes impudent ;-and very impudent to rap a fellow on the brain so hard that he suddenly drops his jack-plain- and then must needs subside into a quandary." "But now Orlando, to be serious, how is it, that men of genius, like you and I, consent to toil and sweat as we do? It's work, work, work! day after day, month after month, year after year! Have we -no  higher aspirations? Are we never to be anything more than mechanics?" "Anything more " returned Orlando, in a tone of rebuke, "what more would we, what more could we be? Is there anything higher to aspire to? point me to a loftier position, or one more honorable-in the esti- mation of honest men. Is there no dignity in being a xlvii *&amp; fil    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5840-00000025"/> 48    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES. mechanic? To rise above that dignity, were to trans- cend the very Deity!"                ! "Flighty, sir, you're flighty! run wild; must be quite out of your head!"  "Why, my dear fellow, God himself, is a mechanic:  think of that. And do not his works honor him? They speak his praise, declare his wisdom, and show  forth his power and goodness. And in all things he bath made, his name is glorified." "That you see, is a very different thing;-we are  not gods-nor likely to be."              ; "Yet you must allow, the mechanic, considered as  such, is Godlike: he imitates the great creator. Is mortal man degraded by that, wherein he resembles, and follows the example of his maker? Who construct-  ed this living temple?" he asked, laying his hand on his breast, "Who made the earth, the trees, the flowers, and the countless objects of beauty and grandeur we behold in the lap of nature, spread out over this mag- nificent world? Who was- the architect of the skies? i who framed the universe, and put in motion its stu-  penduous machinery? Is the hand of omnipotence ever  : idle? Or does -the great mechanic of the'skies, disdain to stamp with his signature the humblest shrub, the meanest herb, or homliest pebble on the face of the  globe? Nay, upon the most insignificant object of cre-  , A^ ation, as well as the most stupenduous, his name's in- scribed.

At the feet  of the man of wealth, have I seen the poor laborer,  who, if measured by his soul, would have overtopped the lordly aristocrat, like some lofty tower on the  mountain's brow, lifting its head proudly above some humble cot in the valley below!"          -[: 'True, Orlando, that may be true,-I grant you 'tis; but let us look at things as the world looks at them-  the unthinking, unreasoning world, if you please." "Well, well,-what then?-go on."          g "Since we live in the world, we must needs conform :  to its customs, fashions,' sentiments-we must think  : and act, as the world thinks and acts. Ay, we must  go the way the world goes. The man who is able to  live Without labor, whether by fortune, by cunning, or by fraud, it matters little whether he be prince or moln- key, the world will respect, flatter, and even kneel to him; while he who toils for his bread, if not absolute- 1 ly scorned, is at least esteemed unworthy to rise, and  incompetent to shine, in any honorable capacity." "Yet, you would perpetuate the very thing you re-  probate.

"Since we can not change the world, it might be wisdom, to humor its whims, and to court its smiles. At all events I'm resolved, hereafter, to go the way the world goes." "The right road to the devil, George." "I'll at least find plenty to jostle me on the way." "That you may; not a few travel that way. But better, far better, George, in my humble judgement, resolve to work on, and lead an honest life." "There's no disguising it, Orlando, say what you will, labor is vulgar, and is only suited to the gross and un- refined. Besides; it blunts the intellect; dulls the edge of our faculties, and stupifies the finer sensibili- ties of man's nature." "Strangely you overlook a great fact: our best scholars, ablest statesmen, distinguished jurists, and most eloquent divines, have undeniably risen from the ranks of working men and mechanics. The leading spirits of the present, as well as of all past ages,-ay, the stars of the literary and scientific world, come from the laboring classes.--Yes, the most brilliant minds that have adorned society, and blest humanity with their light, have been found among the poor, those subsistence depended on daily toil." "Hardly, Orlando, among such as eat their bread in the sweat of their brows."

While his hammer swing- ing arm, acquired strength by wielding the heavy im-r  element of his trade, his busy brain grew strong, plying ; the mighty engine of thought. Instead of blunting  his intellect upon the hard, smooty anvil, over which  he toiled for bread, he but gave it point, edge and temper. While an exertion of sinew, bone and muscle,  drew showers of sparks from the smitten steel, there  was a hammar plying in his brain with no less ener-  ;: gy, bringing out scintillations of soul, that upward ascended to glitter in the firmament of mind,-and reflect back again to earth. A host of illustrious  names, were it needful, might be arrayed, showing be- . yond controversy, that the greatest, profoundest think- ! ers, are ever to be found among men who have work-  ed with their hands as well as their heads." "You then believe not, Hamlet, whom Shakespeare, makes say:  "The hand of little employment, hatA the daintier i senses V"                       S "Ah, that may have been true in Shakespeare's day: for then, kings were tyrants, the rich were lords, and  the laborers were serfs; but in a free country, where  labor is free, and the laborer a free man, the sentiment of the great poet, is untrue." "Well, well, there's no end to argument; besides, I ; hate long speeches. Changing the topic then,-what think you, by this time, of Miss Alnora Delmont, the pink of the aristocracy?" * *     -  iii!

'"Call it such, if you like; beauty, and amiability, I cannot but admire-nay worship." "Sadly smitten, I perceive, but no doubt you 'll sur- vive it." "No, love is immortal; we survive that only which dies while we live. "The life of love, Orlando, depends upon what it feeds on. Yours lives on air, or what is about as unsubstantial, alabaster complexion, ruby lips, and a bright blue eye. Upon such frailty founded, love must of necessity be frail, mutable and short lived." "My affection for Alnora, hath a deeper lodgement; a pure spirit, a noble heart, and great soul, underlie the fair exterior you talk of. Alnora, possesses a higher beauty than that which charms the eye-a fadeless beauty of mind-feasting on which love becomes im- mortal." "If Alnora dared love a mechanic, Orlando, I little' doubt she'd freely give her heart to you." "And why, indeed, may she not love a mechanic?" "Being a wealthy merchant's daughter, and of aris- tocratic mould, of course it would 'nt do. Between the aristocracy and working men, you know there is an impassable gulf." "It ought not, it need not be so." "But it has, is, and will be so while the world stands. The best of the argument may be yours; but    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5840-00000028"/> 54{    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES. still there rcmains the great gulf, deep and wide as hades, separating the democracy from the aristocracy." i "From my humble station, to Alnora's elevated  position, that gulf must be bridged. If I'm notde- ceived, she'll meet me half way." ' I trust it may not break beneath your feet, engulf- ing you both. A perilous adventure! beware."  "In the hope of gaining everything, who is not  willing to risk something"   r  .F   CHAPTER II. Alnora Delmont, referred to in the preceding chap- ter, was the daughter of a wealthy wine merchant, in the city of New York. She was an only child; well educated, and highly accomplished; reputed hand- some; and had reached a marriageable age. Her mother, a vain, ambitious woman, had in her folly, zealously sought to make her daughter like her- self, and fill her young mind with silly aristocratic notions; fortunately, however, with little success; the natural good sense of Alnora, rejected the false ideas of life, and its objects, which the unwise mother, would fain have instilled into her heart. Though finding herself unable to mold the spirit of her daughter, to suit her own notions, she was still ambitious to secure for her such a matrimonial alli- ance as might augment the wealth and respectability of the family; nor did she easily surrender Ihe hope of accomplishing this cherished object. Alnora's grandfather, Mr. Bluster, who was the ex- act prototype of his daughter, Mrs. Delmont, and no less solicitous than she, that Alnora should marry for wealth, was a purse proud, whimsical, capricious old man, who had grown rich by taking advantage of the unfortunate and necessitous. And although once a poor mechanic himself, had come to despise the labor- ing classes, contemn the poor, and to estimate every lv    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5840-00000029"/> 56    THE WAY TIE WORLD GOES. man according to the measure of his means, and by the standard of dollars and cents. Having taken it  g into his head to find Alnora, a rich suitor, one morn- ing after an absence of an hour or two, the old man, might have been seen returning from Wall street, with unwonted gayity and good humor; entering the drawing room, where Mrs. Delmont was seated, he ex- ultingly said:  "Now my prayers are answered, or soon will be; I shall live to see my grand-daughter married as becomes  her family and station, to a man of fortune." "Why do you say so?" demanded Mrs. Delmont, looking up with an expression of surprise. "I 've just had an interview," responded, Mr. Blust- er, " with the wealthy banker, with whom, at the ball : last night, she had the honor of dancing."  "Mardell?" inquired Mrs. IDelmont, eagerly. ( Ay; and he's delighted with Alnora; perfectly delighted with her." "I wish she were delighted with him." "She must be, she must be delighted with him:" said the old man, with great emphasis. "A singular girl, is Alnora," remarked Mrs. Del- mont, despondingly, "she values not riches, cares nothing for a name, and I fear is without ambition."'  i' "Spoiled by having her own way I but in this mat- ter, she must be ruled. Mardell, is a prize; a capital prize; to refuse him, would be madness!" "So it would. We must prevail upon her if we can."           :    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.      57 "Where is Alnora?" "In her chamber, I think."' "The banker, by my invitation, is to call this very day. Tell her so; and see to it, that she makes her toilet to the best advantage. Let her look the queen! Little is gained by making a conquest, if it be not well maintained."Saying which, he turned about, and in a hurried manner left the apartment. Scarce had the old gentleman made his exit, when Alnora entered the drawing room, and was thus ad- dressed by her mother: "Your grandfather brings news, my daughter. I shall begin to think you've something of your mother in you after all. Mr. Mardell, I understand was com- pletely captivated last night! Your charms proved quite irresistable, and took his heart it seems by storm!" "Poor man!" responded Alnora, in a tone of deris- ion, " cupids darts, I apprehend, took less effect than did his gin and brandy potations, in which he indulged so freely." "Nonsense; how provoking you are! But come, there's no time for jesting; make speedy preparations to see your admirer; he will honor you, or so intends I understand, with a call to-day." "Honor me!" replied the daughter, contemptously, such honor, I doubt not, will quite dazzle me t" "Not a bad indication, to hear a young lady ridicule her lover; she's sure to admire and marry him after- wards."    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5840-00000030"/> 58    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES. "We'll see.'" "Now my dear, a little more pains with your toilet.  How 'twould delight me to see you an accomplished coquette t and you might be as well as not. Long ere I had numbered as many summers as you've seen I'd turned the heads of a score of young sparks; had a dozen beaux or more, and was accounted the belle of my native village." "But your daughter, ma, can never be a belle, nor  a coquette." "I'm sure there's no good reason why; you could if you would, play such a part to admiration /"  "Be that as it may, rest assured, I want at least the -inclination."                     'f "Well, well," said the mother coaxingly, "love and marry Mardell, ard, I'll upbraid you not for that." Saying which, she withdrew from the apartment, leav- ing Alnora alone; who after a pause, thus soliloquised:  "' Mardell!-as if I could think of him; a heart-t less, soul-less, superanuated old bachelor! not if he  were encased in gold, and every hair on his head should blossom into a thousand pound note!" At this moment a servant entered, announcing Mr.  Mardell. At the same instant, Susanna, a domestic, who had just donned her best apparel to go shopping,  came in: Alnora, turning to her said: "Mardell, is announced; let him be admitted, but say to him, I am out; for I shall be ere he comes in. t hope he'll take offense, and never more return."    THE WAY THE WORLD 'GOES.      59 Then gliding out in an opposite direction from that in which Mardell was to enter, she quickly disappeared "It's lucky," said the domestic to herself, "I chane- ed to be dressed in my best, since I've got to be sein by the great nabob of Wall street." Directly, Mardell made his appearance, politely bow- ing to Susanna, whom he mistook, owing to her gen- teel attire, for a fashionable belle. "Miss Delmont at home?" enquired the banker, again bowing. "She is out sir ;" answered the domestic. "Went she away before her grandfather returned from Wall street this morning 2" he inquired with a suspicious look and clouded brow; for he had been in- vited by Mr Bluster to call that morning, and supposed Alnora, of course, had been informed of his intentions. "No sir," replied Susanna, with a significant inton- ation, "But directly afterwards. Please be seated sir." Then walking to the opposite side of the chamber, and taking up a newspaper, she affected, to be occupied. Mardell, now looked all the disappointment and chagrin which he inwardly felt; and whispering to himself, through his clenched teeth, said: "Then she must have expected me. The devil! what can this mean? has the old man undertaken to make a fool of me?-No, that cannot be. I'll wager, his grand-daughter thinks to win me by this kind of artifice; affects indifference-ay, 'tis her policy; aha! I'll be even with her in that. Now turning a furtive glance at the domestic, who seemed still occupied with    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5840-00000031"/> 60     THE WAY THE WORLD GOEs.  the latest news, he further soliloqtised: "Who can   : this be I wonder? A fine looking girl, by Jupiter 1 Perhaps a relative-yes, I'll venture 'tis Alnora's cousin Lizzie, of whom I've heard her speak so higly;  a belle, they say, of the first water. Hang me, if I  hav'nt half a mind to make love to her, if for nothing else, than to spite Alnora. It might, by the way, have ii a salutary effect to excite her jealuosy, and pique her a  little. But this Lizzie, is rather a coy bird, I under- stand, and must be cautiously approached. She comes this way ; let me think of something to say." Now    i speaking aloud-- A delightful morning Miss."  "Yes sir ;"Susanna replied, putting-on an-air of ce- ? remony; then, in an undertone, remarked: "Import     l ant information-"   "I call you Miss, presuming you are an unmarried  lady."  "'Tis my good fortune sir, to be yet free from the -shackles of wedlock ;" adding in a whisper: "What a fool he is!"'  "The shackles of wedlock: ha! ha! Then you es- teem wedded life a state of bondage, it would seem?" "Is it not,:sir?" "Upon my word, miss, I see not why a woman  should loose her liberty when she becomes a wife."  "Could I but have my way," said Susanna, with a  mischievous twinkle in her eye, "every living man should loose his, upon becoming a husband'." "Good heavens.! Miss, you can't be serious?" "MOsit serious; why shouldn't I be? Do not hus-  :Ji!,   THE WAY THE WOiLD- GOiEs.     6 bands invariably turn despots, when not at 'once hen- pecked into meekness and submission-as all ought to be 2" And turning away walked again tothe opposite side of the appartment.  "By Jove, I begin to think her a termigant-a re- gular vixin!" said the banker, aside to himself. '"But it may be, after all, she means little what she says:- the fact is, upon the whole, I rather like' her humor. Confound me, if I'm not tempted to propose taking- her out riding." Now, advancing towards her, he said: "How would you like Miss--Miss Lizzie, shall I call you?" "If you choose, sir,-and fancy that name." "Always right in my surmises. Then as I was ab- out to say, how would you like an hour's ride in the salubrious air this beautiful morning?" "Sure, nothing could please me better, sir ;" replied the domestic, eager. for a prank, and now fully com- prehending the mistake under which the banker la- bored.  "My carriage is at the gate;" he added, 'let me then have the honor, and enjoy the pleasure of your com- pany." "I'll be highly gratified, sir-and can be ready in a moment ;" she observed, with an air of cheerftulness; and going into a private chamber, made preparation for the ride. During the most part of the preceding conversations Uncle Jack, as he was familiarly called, and who made no ceremony at any time in visiting the Delmonts, /-'    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5840-00000032"/> THiE WAY THE WORLD GoEs.- having entered unobserved, stood near the threshold  of the drawing room, where he overheard what past.  After a suppressed chuckle, he humorously said to him-. self: "Ah, ha: a regular swell-head, unwittingly play-  ing the agreeable to a domestic! ha I ha! ha a ca- pital joke!"                      ; Mardell, strutting across the floor, while Susanna  : was gettingready, and thinking himself alone and un- observed, thus congratulated himself:  "A devilish good hit: Revenge is sweet. By the  lord Earry, I'm not to be beaten in a game of decep-  f tion ;-let the heiress put on her hauteur, if she thinks  it'll win. Coquette me who can!" Susanna, re-entering, bonnetted and shawled, pro-   1 ceeded to a table in a remote corner of the room, pick- ed up a pair of silk gloves; saying to herself, as she did so--I'llput on Alnora's gloves, to conceal the  working complexion of these tell-tale hands, that are not of the purest lilly white. Fingers of idleness may go ungloved, but mine, to pass current with a cox-  comb must be covered." Now, signifying to Mardell,  her readiness, he offered his arm, which was accepted, aud directly they were side by side in the bankers splen- did vehicle, whirling with the pomp of tiptop aristo- cracy down Broadway. *  "- *  -  * - ,  *       *       ,  Soon after Mardell and Susanna had taken their de-  parture, Alnora returned. Scarcely had she entered the parlor when her grand-father came in.    Txn WAY- THE WORLD GObB      68s "Has the banker yet called, Alnora)?" he hatily inquired. "I've seen him not ;' she simply answered. "Some accident, it must be, detains him ;".remark- ed the old man, with evident concern. "I hope grandpa," said the girl, earnestly, "you'll invite him to call no more." "What, what? have you lost your senses 2 Disdain the richest man in the city? Away with such foty! not a word more; Mr. Mardell, has already signified to me that his mind's made up; says, he can love and- make you happy." Quite too hasty; he may find reason to change his mind. At all events, 'twould become him more to presume less, till he knows whether his love's recipro; cated. Rest assured, it never will be by me." "Then my trouble for my pains!" exclaimed the old gentleman, fietfully. ' A thankless task I've had; :" lie continued, in an excited tone; and poor Mr. Mardell must now suffer the disgrace and mortification of be- ing discarded,!" And stamping his cane angrily upon the floor, hurried out of the "apartment. "How ungrateful, Alnora!" said Mrs. Delmont, who had entered while the above conversation was going on. "Consider what pains your grandfather's taken," continued she, "to find you a suitor, worthy of your hand, and suitable to your rank and fortune!" "I must then unite myself to a man I hate, and make myself unhappy for life, in order to be grateful, and to humor agrandfather's whim, or rather, tosatis. /  ,     <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5840-00000033"/> ";    TuTHE WAY THE WORLD GOES:.1 fy his avarice! What other recommendation than money, brings this vaunted suitor?5" "Ah,.my child, in riper years, money, you may learn to value. Zone, lightly as you prize it, is character, influence, everything I Mark my words, you'll find it so.' without waiting to give her daughter an op-  portunity for reply, she left the room, going into an-  other apartment. *Heaven forbid!" exclaimed, Alnora, to herself. "If it be so," added she, with saddened tones, "then is life less desirable than I'd thought. If money be everything, alas all that I've learned to love and value, are nothing! After a pause and a sigh, she added;  "'Tis little use to have a heart in this cold, unfeeling i world."  "Say you so, my winsome lassie?" called out Uncle  Jack, in a merry tone, as he came dashing into the  drawing room, having overheard Alnora's last remark.: "Too much heart, simple girl, that's the trouble;" said he, "its throbs are too mighty for the delicate frame-  work, the tender bosom that holds it."  "Yet I would not cast aught of it away, Uncle  Jack ;"-returned Alnora, "fbr what were life without  a heart to feel?"  "Less bitter, less bitter, be assured;" he answered, half serious, half in jest, "like you, I once had a heart to feel; but found it expensive to keep; so turned it out of doors to mix with a stony hearted world, where it soon had a chance to petrify.

"True Uncle Jack, a heart that feels, in this unfeel- ing world, must cost us dearly ;-at least, it obliges us to expend many sighs and tears ;-yet, let me ever cherish a heart of tender sensibilities. No treasures do I prize like heart treasures." "Had'st thou less of heart, dear one, thou'dst know less of sorrow." "Ay, and, perhaps, less of joy." "That indeed might be;-divested of a capacity to suffer, we should necessarily be deprived of capacity for enjoyment. But how illy suited, alas, such an ethe- rial nature as thine, to this selfish, bleak, and hollow- hearted world!" "Give me misery, with a heart to feel, rather than make me queen of the whole earth, and doom me to heartlessness. I'll hope on, Uncle Jack, hope on, till disappointment come. To mortals in adversity, hope's rosy light, is like the rainbow's glow on the bosom of the weeping cloud.' "Changing the topic, Alnora-are you aware the great Wall-street banker, called while you were out to- day?" "Yes; and I left on purpose to avoid seeing him."

"You'll not thimkI've been idle," replied Susanna, taking off her gloves, "when you see these washboard blisters." At the same time advancing towards him, and holding out her ungloved domestic hands; the sight of which struck her aristocratic gallant, for the moment,: speechless. With a ghastly expression of countenance, he began to recede, hem, and cough, Af- ter backing him half across the floor, in making him see the marks of toil upon her hands, she turned away saying to herself: "Alas, the sight of a few little work blisters, has at once disenchanted the poor mortal." After standing dumbfounded for a space, Mardell, ex- claimed to himself; "Heaven and earth!-a hired girl! and the drudge of the family Have I lost my senses? Coquetting a servant --taken her out riding!-Was ever a man fooled and bedevilled at such a 'rate? If this gets out, I'll never hear the last of it.

"Sure, I've made an impression!" soliloquised Su- sanna, who stood, seemingly occupied, in a remote part of the room; "if not on his heart," she added, "at least upon some internal muscle or membrane. perhaps, his gall wallet." The banker, after a few uneasy strides to and fro across the floor, again paused as if to reflect upon the dilemma, in which he had placed himself;-then di- ') /i-i    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5840-00000035"/> eS'         ,,TuHEi WAY TfIE WOBLD GOS. rectly gave vent to his thoughts in the following words:-  "Zounds-I instead of spiting Alnora, I've but ex- posed myself to her ridicule.

Having let off the effervescence of his outraged feelings, he  abruptly took his departure.  "Ha I ha!" laughed Susanna, "If he'll but go hang himself, it'll be a good joke." Alnora and Uncle Jack, to the no little surprise of Susanna, now gave fall vent to their risibilities, and coming out from their hiding places, the three indulg- ed in immoderate laughter at the expense of the poor banker.  -  act.-,-        -         4.! - ,  . .   CHAPTER II. A few days subsequent t the incidents mentioned, in the latter part of the foregoing chapter, Alnora and her cousin Lizzie might have. been seen, at eventide, promenading the garden-walks together, at Mr. Del- mont's, engaged in earnest conversation; their tones were soft and low, which might have led to- the con- jecture, that some love affair occupied their minds,- which indeed was the case. "Now Lizzie," said Alnora, "let me give you a pro- blem."  "A problem? well, if it be neither deep, nor diffi- cult." "Suppose, cousin, occupying the social position you do, it should happen that you meet with a mechanic, a young man of suitable age; in every respect aman: and in the true sense, a gentleman; yet of poor, and obscure parentage: and say, he may be, owing to ha- bits of toil, wanting somewhat, in easy polished man- ners;-his footfall is heavy; his hands hard and sun- burnt: but suppose, that in spite of this seeming coase- ness, you admire him above all the exquisites and fashionable fops that ever fluttered round you;--ay, you see in him an intrinsic worth, that renders him superior, in your estimation, to the wealthiest and  proudest among the suitors for your hand:' add to this, that he cherishes for you, a true, pure, deep " lxix. 1 1*    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5840-00000036"/> 70    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.  and constant love ;-what would you do in such a case?" "That you've puzzled me, I must at least confess, Al- nora. To marry him, or even to encourage his love and receive his attentions, would be to loose my po- X sition in society, and forfeit the esteem of my friends."  "And would you crush your heart's warm, spontau neous love, for the sake of fashionable society, and the deceitful smiles of a vain, frivolous, and- conceited aris-  tocracy-  "Hardly can I tell, Alnora, what, under such cir- cumstances I might do.

I admire him,--can't help but  admire him. 'Tis not, I persuade myself an emotion of love: but a peculiar regard not very unlike it."  @ "Pray, whoi ist, Alnora? Have I seen him?" "No, if you had, you'd loved him." "Then you reckon me the more susceptible, eh?"  "At least a more ready appreciation you have of true merit." 'I shall be tempted, I fear, to become your rival. But go on, cousin, tell me more:--my curiosity's get- ting on tip-toe. Is he the carpenter, who is doing the work on your tenement?"   THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.      71 "The same.

And a more jealous eye will be kept upon you on account of your slighting the banker, whom they are so anxious to have you wed. And by the way, I understand, Mardell, will take no denial'" "No; he perseveres, notwithstanding all the slights and insults I can offer him." "It grows late, Alnora, I must return home." "Let me see you soon again, cousin." "I will; and shall be anxious to learn how this ro- mantic love affair progresses." "Remember now, Lizzie, make no confidants in this matter. I would have disclosed it to none other." "Fear me not; your secret is perfectly safe-rely on hat." After Lizzie, had taken her leave, Alnora indulged n the following soliloquy : "How is it, I must always have some body to help ne keep a secret? And why not that some body, want ome body to help her keep it? And -then the third ome body, want still another some body? and so on, ill the whole neighborhood's in possession of the thing o be kept?

"So, -so, the birds have all flown;" soliloquised grandfather Bluster, upon entertng the sitting-room, X after an early morning's walk, and finding it deserted. Directly discovering one of the domestics in an adjoin-  ing room, he said: "None left within doors but you,  Susanna? 2"  "None sir," replied she, still going on with her work.  "Gone out to taste the air," remarked the old gentle- '  man, half soliloquising. "'Tis well," he continued, "the morning's breath is balmy, sweet and refresh- ing. Which way have they strolled ." demanded he,' again turning to the domestic. "Mr. and, Mrs. Delmont, are walking in the garden, Alnora's out riding." "Aha!" said the old man, resuming his soliloquy,  and speaking loud enough to be overheard by the do- mestic, "with Mardell! My scolding did the girl some good. I well knew she'd begin to think better  of her grandfather's advice after a little sober reflec-  tion."       -  "She did'nt go with Mardell," said Susanna, inter-  rupting the old man's soliloquy.

In uttering the last sentence, he -low- ered somewhat the tones of his voice,-yet his words, were loud enough to be heard by Susanna;--who, as soon as the old man went out, remarked to herself: "What an angel she would have been, with her grandfather's temper and amiability.

"Good morning, Uncle Jack," said Alnora, bound-  ing into the house like a skipping lamb. "Smart as a honey-bee," exclaimed uncle Jack; "'out this morning, I understand, before the dew was off the flowers! Ay, that's right-stir your youthful  blood ; snuff the free, fresh air of heaven ; no one ever foundered from taking too much breath;-you may  stint the stomach, but forget not to cram the lungs."

"True, that may be superior minds, sometimes stoop ?i to humble callings." "How stupid I am!" exclaimed Alnora, now taking  the hint, "not to have seen from the first, that you were  only quizzing me. Uncle Jack, I may, ere long, have f something to impart to you-and then your advice and friendship to crave." "In anything, Alnora, murder and treason only ex- epted, I'll be happy to serve you ;" said Uncle Jack,  half serious, half in jest. "But beware," he added, I "you make- not too many confidants.

"It's no use, it's no use," muttered Grandfather Bluster, as he entered the drawing-room; "Alnora wont be advised; sterner measures must be used- else she'll never marry him." "I know not what to do ;" replied Mrs. Delmont, I've lectured her till my very tongue's grown weary." "Just the way," remarked Mr. Delmont, "to make her hate the man you'd have her love. Love can't be forced, can't be forced; it must be free as air, and spring spontaneous from the heart like a gushing stream from its deep fountain. There's no use trying either to spur or bridle it." 4 I disagree with you Mr. Delmont' said the old man, impatiently, " love, is like a headlong, brainless colt, that never can be safely rode without whip, spur and bridle." "Ah, when you'd make it a steed to be rode to for- tune," replied the other, "then reining and goading may be needful ;-the race may be won, and the gold- en prize carried off, but what you reckon love in the beginning, turns out hate in the ending."Saying which, he took up his hat and cane and went out. "Take things into your own hands, my daughter," said Bluster to Mrs. Delmont, ," take things into your own hands." "That I intend," replied she with emphasis. "Yon lxxix    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5840-00000041"/> 80    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES. have got to hold a tight rein upon that girl, if you want her not to disgrace the family by marrying some  thriftless plebian." "She'll marry the banker, or Ill know the reason  why 1" responded the lady, rising to her feet- with a determined air, and going out of the apartment.  ' Love, love," soliloquised, Mr. Bluster, " a whim! an idle dream! What's it worth? One may starve to death on it; we cantiot eat it; drink it; nor clothe  ourselves- with it. It shelters not from chilling winds nor beating rains. It'll do for idle poets and romancers to write about ;-but it never butteredrany man's bread, nor woman's either; it never filled any man's purse:  I therefore count it a profitless thing." It was in the cool of the evening-a quiet, balmy summer evening; Alnora was walking in the garden, seemingly wrapped in deep meditation; at length  pausing, and turning an admiring gaze upon the glory which the last beams of the king of day were paint- ing upon the western sky, she seemed to drink in divine inspiration, and thus, touchingly soliloquised: "On the gentle bosom of yon blushing cloud which; hangs o'er the sea, the weary sun is pillowing his burn-  ing head. Hie ,yellow locks fade from the blue sky, which now 'gins to put on dusky habiliments." Here  :pausing, her eyes wandered over the wide expanse of heaven; then resuming her soliloquy, thus went on: "Sable night, comes in state to shut -the gates'of :light;-hlere and there, a silver star with more than , .    TiE WAY THE WORLD GOES.       81 diamond lustre, glitters amid the deepening azure of heaven's, wide canopy."Again pausing, and turning her gaze eastward she said: "And now with silvery sheen the queenly moon, rising from her vapor couch, looks o'er the dewy hills, serenely smiling through the white, fleecy clouds that so softly veil her face of beauty. How tranquil, how impressive the hour! Sweet solitude how instructive thou art T Under thy genial influence my heartgrpws pensive, and is filled *ith delicious sentiments' - Now bending her eyes to the ground, while a shadow gath- ered upon her brow, betokening the presence of a heavy thought, she began to traverse the garden walks and thus, in scarcely audible tones, discoursed to herself; I wish Orlando were here to exchange a word and a thought with me. How false, and how cruel the cus" toms of the world  My poor heart is like the impris- oned dove, that day by day beats the bars of its cage with its snowy wings; it longs,it sighs and pants to be free. Does he think of me?" - At this juncture, she was startled by the sound of footsteps near. "Pardon me ;".said a familiars voice. "Why, Orlando, it is you," said Alnora looking confused. "I disturb your meditations," remarked the young man in the tone of apology.  "No matter," rejoined the blushing maid, "I was only a little surprised."  "I've sometime anxiously desired,. Alnora, to speak with you at greater length, touching that on which we    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5840-00000042"/> 82    TaE WAY THE WORLD GOES. last conversed; but the golden ball of opportunity has been hard to catch. Jealous eyes have been constantly upon us; and it is now only by stealth that we are per- v! mitted to exchange either words or look."  4' 'Tis even so."  ' Do they still insist that you marry for gold?"' "They will hear to nothing else."  "I trust, Alnora, you think not of a compliance?"  The young lady sighed, and for a moment remained !silent; which, Orlando, misenterpreting, was led to exclaim-"Alas! Alnora, and is it possible you've consented to sacrifice yourself?--to throw away your heart's noblest, purest treasures-will you at last bow down to mammon, and worship at his shrine? O, an-  swer me,-must you, after all, give your hand to the man you have professed to despise?" '"Not till my soul is bankrupt," answered she, firmly,i 'in every redeeming quality; bereft of every gem,   j fobbed of every virtue!" "Why did I distrust? my own heart should have told me gold could not buy thee. Sweet angel, thou art thyself a jewel more precious than glittering gold or sparkling diamonds 1 Nay, I do not flatter;-speak  loved one-speak to me fieely. Why so coy? You seem  strangely reserved."  "Orlando, believe me, I confide in you, and would keep back nothing; my love for you I seek not to dis- guise."                        : "Then am I happy.

"Fondly, O, how fondly I believe what thou sayest!" he exclaimed, clasping her hand with all the enthusi- asm of love. "And wilt thou then be mine?" "Think, Orlando, what it is to be disinherited and disowned." "'Tis hard, I know 'tis hard; and hardly have I the heart to ask so much; yet I do. How selfish, how sel- fish is this wretched heart of mine! but 'tis love for thee, 'tis love for thee, Alnora, that makes it so." "Wrong not thyself, Orlando; no selfish nature is thine. Naught dwells in thy generous bosom that an- gels might not be proud to cherish." "Say not that I am unselfish': why do I ask thee, love, to give up friends, home, riches, rank, flatterers, luxu- ries,-all, all for my sake, for myself, who have nothing to offer thee but my poor heart and toiling hands, Yet, how willingly, how gladly would heart and hands be taxed, all their energies to maintain and make thee happy!" "Could I ask more? "But to see thee brook poverty, the scorn of the rich, and the burning taunts of thy kindred, who would mock to behold thee-in the humble walks of life, and wedded to one who is doomed to toil-how can I think of it?

"Were that all, Orlando, there would be no barriers to our union. But such an event, I fear, would break, my father's heart." "So muck does he dislike me?"X "No; but he's proud, very proud ; and besides, at- taches muchimportance to wealth. Though he be wrong in this, how can I cross him-and, in a matter so se- rious "  'Then you bid me hope no more?" "That, Orlando, were too sad a thing to say." - "Alnora, let my heart break if it will; better it should, than that you be made unhappy. Consider no longer my wishes, but your own welfare; and heaven  direct you for the' best."  Hearing the garden gate open, Alnora looked around-, saying as she did so: "Discovery might bring reproach.  Let us for the present separate. We'll speak further, anon."        ,  "So be it: till then, heaven keep and protect you." , "Adieu, Orlando, till we meet again. May holy an- gels guard you." "Adieu, dearest, adieu." After going a few paces, Orlando paused to look  after her ' and in the fulness of his warm heart which afresh had been set on fire, he exclaimed within himself:  "What a seraph she is!

"Well, well, for manners sake, and to please a wo- man, who is never pleased, but with herself, I must drink a glass of wine,' soliloquised Uncle Jack, as he sat down to a table at Delmont's, on which had been placed, for his special accommodation, a bottle of wine and silver cup. "The fact is,' continued he, still dis- coursing-to himself, "my cousin,- Mrs. Delmont, is a very clever lady, in her way; especially when about to crave a particular favor. In that, however, I mustown she's not singular ;-'tis the way the world goes."Then filling his cup, he raised it to his lips, saying; "Wine, like women, to be tested, must needs be tasted."Sip- ping the beverage and setting down his cup, he added-: "I'm heartily glad grandaddy Bluster .happens to be away to-day--he always gives me the itch."' Scarcely had he finished this sentence, when the old man entered the apartment, with a clouded brow, and evidently in an ill humor. "Confound it-here he. comes- I whispered Uncle Jack to himself, "like old Riugtail, rat the very men- tion of his name. I wish the-seven plagues had him t!

"She might as well as not marry a millionaire!" ex- claimed the old gentleman with emphasis ; at the same moment looking up, discovered Uncle Jack. "Ho, ho, grandfather," cried the latter, not seeming to have noticed the old man's soliloquy, "spry as ever!" "Ah, I might be," he responded, complainingly, "had I fewer troubles, and less to try my christian pa-  tience."  "Ha, ha, ha!" chuckled Uncle Jack. 'Now really, that makes me laugh. Ha, ha, ha! Why, grandfather Bluster, believe me, you are happier than a king ; and have no more need for patience, than has a donkey for ! a prayer book!"  "Hang the vulgar fellow!"-muttered the old man, turning round scornfully, "he must needs adorn his speech by coupling me with a Jackass."  "The devil admire me if I speak not the truth. Buti alas, grandfather, 'tis not in man to be satisfied: the rich must be richer; the great, greater ;-even age and  decrepitude, while fortune smiles, we see still cherish-  ing ambition, avarice and pride." - "Say not age and decrepitude to me, Uncle J4ck;  'tis a liberty I allow no man to take.

"As well on their heads as heels," whispered Uncle Jack to himself, "little matter which end's up when one extremity may boast as much brains as the other." "Believe me, sir, Alnora would sooner marry a pen- niless wretch, not able to purchase himself a grave, than she'd wed a nabob, who could lead her to a princely palace? But I'm not to be baffled: by me came the wealth which has enabled the whole family to prick up their ears, and find countenance among the aristocracy. To my money they owe their respectability and position in society." "When a man becomes his own trumpeter, he never lacks for mind," remarked Uncle Jack, in an under tone, which the old man failed to heed. "Yes, sir, my money has made them what they are. And now my word shall be law." "Better leave Alnora to her own choice, if you'd have her marry happily," observed Uncle Jack, now grow- ing more serious. "Her own choice? Aha, to ruin the reputation of us all, by uniting herself to some worthess plebeian!" "Count not every man worthess whom fickle fortune may have left moneyless." "Ah, but who has respect for a bankrupt? scarce less despised is he than a knave." "There is a species of bankruptcy, more to be depre- ciated than the penury which collapses the purse-a    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5840-00000045"/> 885  '  THE WAY TEE WORLD GOS.-  bankruptcy of soul! And which, alas, now-a-days, is coming much into vogue."  - 'Tis plain, Uncle Jack, you have very low ideas; and so had your father before you. Now, as to the re-  lationship between us, and on which you so much pre- sume, I count it very distant." "Would to heaven it were remoter still."       l '/The same kind of blood runs not in our veins-- that's evident."  "So I think;-God be thanked. But letting this pass-I trust, Mr. Bluster, you'll no longer strive to press Alnora into a false and mercenary marriage. Ask her not, I entreatyou, to give her hand to a man who  ? is incapable of winning her heart. Let her affections guide her. For there is an intuition of the heart more  sure than the logic of the head. The unbiased mind of youth is often instinctively right on great moral ques-  tions, while age, learning and experience, run wide of the mark. Rely upon it, 'tis safer to trust the heart, than the head." "Set yourself up to give advice to me, sir?'" demanded the old man, indignantly.                 "I set myself down to it, sir," coolly replied Uncle F.. Jack, at the same time lifting his cup, and deliberately sipping his wine. "I count it presumption, sir!-besides, I half sus- pect you, sir, for putting absurd notions into my grand- daughter's head-perhaps the very cause of her aver. sion to the millionaire."

Here the old man kindled to a desperate rage: "You, sir," he vociferated, "I pronounce an impertinent, pry- ing, plotting, mischief-making, pestilential fellow! Un- derstand that, sir!" Uncle Jack, now -illing his cup, provokingly re marked: "I must fire up a little, while it blusters." "Do you hear, sir?" thundered the exasperated old man, as Uncle Jack was in the act of quaffing his flow- ing cup. "This wine relishes exceedingly well," was his only reply. "I call you, sir, a vile intruder!" continued Bluster, with increasing vehemence, and burning wrath, "an interloper!-much given to not minding your own business!" "The harder the wind blows, the sooner the storm will be over," again sipping his wine. "This is deli- cious. Wine, like woman's ruby,lips, woos to kiss, and come again." "No business have you, sir, concerning yourself about what's none of your business." "An excellent beverage!" said Uncle Jack, turning off another bumper. "Never mind, sir, never mind-every dog has his day!" "And every day has its dog."'

I   CHAPTER VI. Uncle Jack, who possessed a noble, generous heart, notwithstanding his plain, blunt manner, had now re- solved upon doing all within his power to defeat Mrs. Delmont and grandfather Bluster, in their detestable scheme of forcing Alnora into an unwilling marriage.  Notwithstanding the coolness which directly began to manifest itself towards him at Delmonts, he hesitated not to call whenever so minded. Some time subse- quent to the offense he had given Mr. Bluster, he went in, hoping to have an opportunity of giving a sly word of advice to Alnora. Entering the house in his usual unceremonious, and careless manner, he began to look round for the persecuted girl; but was directly con- fronted by the old man, who abruptly bade him begone. To the insult he only replied, by remarking: "If all the fools were out of the world, there'd be more room in it." "Ah! and if Satan had his own, where would you be, scape-grace?" "Why, some where mourning the loss of our grand- father, to be suree" In a fame, the old gentleman hurried off into another apartment. Uncle Jack seated himself alone, and sat some time, patiently watching for Alnora, who at length made her appearance. But no sooner had she entered into conversation with him, than she was inter- "    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5840-00000047"/> 92    TmE WAY THE WORLD GOEs. rupted by her grandfather, whose suspicions were wide awake. "A word with you, Alnora," he said, in a tone of authority, at the same time motioning her to the oppo- site side of the chamber. "What, grandfather?" she gently inquired, as she approached him   . '"Mr. Mardell now awaits your answer. Ie author- izes me to say, that for the last time, be offers you his hand. Now, my dear, such another opportunity may never be yours for making a great marriage. Only think of it-an opulent banker is at your feet." "There let him stay, and kiss the ground, if he likes," replied the girl, indignantly. 'Tis then, avarice and pride, you'd have influence me, rather than the higher  considerations of moral worth, virtue and intelligence,  in making choice of a companion for life?" ' "Have your own way! have your own way P' said the old man, kindling with fury. "Look upon wealth  and station with contempt I but you'll one day see the folly of it. Remember what I tell you." "I grant, there's power in wealth, and advantage in station ; but how oft do hollow hearts and empty heads enjoy both." Mrs. Delmont, now coming in, the old gentleman turning to her, said: "I can beat nothing into this girl's head; if I do, it leaks out again the very next minute." "'Tis plain, she'll never come to anything, unless it is to beggary."          ,   THE WAY TriE WORiLD ,:GOE      93: "Yes-then she'll find the associates she prefers - mechanics, coachmen, and, the like. Simple girl, how/ little she knows of the world! If our-coachman were a lord, she could not treat him with greater considera- tion than she does."            X "Pray, what loose we, said Alnora, by treating every- one with respect? or what gain we, by showing unkind- ness to our inferiors? How easy it is to be courteous, even to a beggar. Orlando is civil to me ; why-shouldI be rude to him? Shall I let a coachman surpass me in politeness?" "Nonsense.!" exclaimed the old man, "let laboring men know their places. What are they better than slaves?"  "You surprise me, grandfather; were you not once a laboring man?" "Hush! hush!" said her- mother, "never mention such a thing!" "I remember hearing grandma say," rejoined Alno- ra, "he used to be a hard worker, and an excellent shoe- maker." "Hold your tongue, I bid you. I'm surprised at your indiscretion; suppose such a thing should get out?" '"What of it? is it not true, that he once made shoes?" "That was long ago," said the old man, "and before I'd got up in the world." "Little matter what we sprung from," remarked Mrs. Delmont, "so we're prudent enough to keep it to our- selves."    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5840-00000048"/> "    E THm WAY THE WORLD GOES. Uncle Jack, who still occupied a seat in a remote part of the chamber from where the talkers stood, feign-  ing to be inattentive to what was Eaid, nevertheless overheard the entire conversation. A mischievous thought now entering his mind, he approached the old man, and grasping his hand warmly, said: "Aha, grandfather, I'm now convinced the time hag been when you were an honest, well-meaning man, and useful citizen. Yes, yes, give me the man who has hammered out an honest living upon the lapstone-ay, the plain, old-fashioned lapstone. The time has been, when it was no disgrace to be a mechanic; labor was once honorable, and working men respected. But that, grandfather, was before you got up in the world." -  "The old man, greatly confused, tried to pull away; but Uncle Jack still holding on to his hand, seemed determined that he should hear him out. "Don't go yet, grandfather; stay and let us have an old-fashioned talk about old times-when men were  honest, and honesty was honored." Without being able to stammer out any distinct re-  ply, the old gentleman broke away, and hastened to get out of the hearing of these annoying compliments.  Mrs. Delmont, no less confused than the old man, also hurried out of the apartment. "Grandpa honors not the stepping-stone by which he climbed up in the world," remarked Alnora. "Because it was a lapstone," responded Uncle Jack, laughing. "To live by honest toil, is no more honora- ble; cunning fraud and overreaching, are now-a-days, 'EI   THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.      95 far more respectable, than homely toil, and plain hon- esty. Well, well, so goes the world-and sure, the devil likes to have it so."  "I hope grandpa has now taken a lesson of humility, that may profit him,"' observed Alnora. "The recol- lection of having been a shoemaker, though mortifying to his pride, may improve his piety."                -         <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5840-00000049"/> CHAPTER VIII. "Alnora," said Mr. Bluster, entering the drawing- room, one day, where the girl, sat playing upon the pianoforte, "by my invitation, Mr. Mardell is to call this afternoon. I'm resolved the breach shall be healed. Now, like a good girl, take your grandfather's advice, and make an apology to the gentleman, for the many  slights you've given him-especially for the last, which wounded him so deeply."  "I apologize to Mardell?" she replied, indignantly,  while her pretty white lip curled with proud scorn. "He'll certainly expect it."  "Just as certainly then will he be disappointed."  : The old man's brow now gathered blackness; and he was about to burst forth in a tempest of wrath, when Uncle Jack suddenly entered the room-saying, in a deep, solemn voice, and with a roguish look: "We three meet again."               A "And I'd as soon meet beelzebub," growled the old man, turning his back upon the intruder.  "A coolness in the atmosphere to-day," remarked Uncle Jack, fixing a meaning glance on Bluster. "And there'll be a coolness for some time to come," responded the latter, in a surly tone. "Then will not our fat melt nor our love dissolve us," rejoined Uncle Jack; then turning to. Alnora,  j said: "And how are you, my dear girl? I declare you 96   THE WAY THE WORLD GOS:       97 look charming as a moss-rose! No wonderMaidellis bewitched." "He's more likely to be bedeviled!" exclaimed the old gentleman, in a tone of violent passion. "Hi, ho! grandfather's not so cool as he was a while ago.   Mrs. Delmont now entered; and in a moment after, a servant appeared, announcing Mr. Mardell. "Show him in," said the lady. "Better show him out," remarked Alnora, aside. Directly the banker made his appearance, bowing very low, as he passed the threshhold, in a strained effort to show his politeness. "Ah, my good sir,"' cried grandfather, grasping his hand warmly, "we owe you a thousand apologies!" "Indeed, sir, indeed!" returned Mardell, again bow- ing.  "Grandfather, let me beg an introduction to Mr. Mardell, of whom I've so often heard you speak," said Uncle Jack, in a mock serious tone. "And always in the highest terms," said the old man, with emphasis. "Always." "Mr. Mardell, this is Uncle Jack, as every body calls him." The banker bowed stiffly, and with an air that savored of great condescension. Uncle Jack waited till he was through, and had got fairly straight- ened again; then;-with a scrape, and a conge, re- turned the nabob's saiutation.-his manner leaving the 9    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5840-00000050"/> 98    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES. latter in doubt, whether to ascribe it to awkwardness, or consider it a take-off. "Now, grandfather, go on with your thousand apol- ogies," said Uncle Jack, "and by the way, that reminds me of 'The thousand and one stories of the Arabian Night's Entertainments ; a remarkable book! and all  of which I most religiously believed from my youth up." "Uucle Jack's a queer fellow,"' remarked the old  man, apologetically. "But as I was saying, Mr. Mar-  ? dell, we owe you many apologies; for it must be con- fessed, sir, you've not been treated by every member of  our family, with that consideration due to a man of your standing, and circumstances." "Miss Delmont, I dare say, will be able to make the whole matter perfectly satisfactory," observed the bank- er, turning to the young lady, with a simper and a bow, making sure that the heiress had at last grown peni-  tent, and was ready to kneel at his feet. A haughty look from Alnora, however, in which was filly ex- pressed the supreme contempt she felt, quickly unde- eeived him. 'An apology, my daughter, an apology!" said her grandfather, coaxingly. "I've none to Offer," replied she, in a firm, decided tone of voice. "Go, then, and marry a serf or a beggar! for aught I care," stormed the old man; and wheeling about, commenced pacing the floor in a state of great agitation.  At this juncture, Molley, a servant girl, came in with a boquet, saying:    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.       99 "Some prettyflowers, Alnora, for you."  "O, they are beautiful!" exclaimed Alnora, taking the boquef from Molley. "Who sent them 2" "A young gentleman." "Aha, 'tis evident I have a rival," remarked the banker, with an affected smile, behind which, mani- festly lurked the bitternees of gall. "Say, Molley," demanded Mrs. Delmont, "where did they come from?" "I mus'nt tell; Orlando told me not to," answered the simple-minded girl. "A coachman for a rival, Mr. Mardell-a coachman for a rival!" exclaimed Mrs. Delmont, attempting to jest, yet evidently in no humor for laughing. "I am highly honored," returned he, bitterly. "The fellow should be chastised for his impudence," said Bluster, passionately. "Cast them away, Alnora; cast them away!" "God made the flowers, grandpa; why should I des- pise them?" replied the noble hearted girl. "But consider whose hand plucked them," observed her mother-"a plebeian's!" she added, with scorn. "They smell as sweet," returned Alnora, snuffing their fragrance with an air of gayety, "a if a prince's hand had culled them." Mr. Mardell now!abruptly made for the door, to take his departure; and looking in an exceeding ill humor. Mrs. Delmont, following him to the threshhold, said: 'I trust, Mr. Mardell, you'll think nothing of Alno- ra's freaks: she's a giddy, thoughtless girl, and I doubt    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5840-00000051"/> 100    THE WAY THt WORLD GOES.  not, will soon be sorry for what she's done. I'll see to  it, that she treats you so no more." "Then will I rest easy, madam-assured that Miss Alnora has a mother who knows how to teach her to appreciate a man worthy of her hand," replied he, gra- ciously bowing; then made his exit. "Poor fellow!" said Uncle Jack, in a tone of mock sympathy, "if he should chance to meet the tholkiller-"' "He'd need a coffin more than a wife," chimed in Alnora, finishing the sentence. "Grandfather Bluster now turned upon them like a tempest--his lowering brow looking black as a thun- der cloud. "The explosion's coming Alnora!" cried Uncle Jack, "Iet us get out of harm's way. Satan, lay me by  the heels if we ain't in danger of a blowing up!" at the same time hastening out of the apartment, followed by Alnora. "Perdition overtake that audacious fellow!" vocif- erated the old man; "if I once begin on him, he'll think it's hailing! I warrant he will. Go lecture that l girl, my daughter;-go lecture her well." "That I will," said Mrs. Delmont, emphatically, and going out with an air of determination. "In the meantime, give that interloper a broadside." "Never fear, I'll give him the mischief! see if I don't." "Hang me," soliloquised the old man, now left alone, "if I don't believe that simple girl loves the coachman. 1 'LX   THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.      101 Confound the fellow, let him presume to drive a coach over the dignity of our family-zounds!" His thoughts now becoming too great for utterance, he shook his head, struck his cane upon the floor, and made haste to seek the open air, that he might breathe more fieely.    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5840-00000052"/> CHAPTER IX. When it come to be fully believed that Alnora loved  Orlando, the poor girl was tormented almost out of her life; and compelled to suffer all that ridicule and ma- lignant reproach could inflict. At length, growing weary of the taunts and unmerited abuse of her friends and acquaintances, she determined upon retaliation, and straightway devised a most laughable plan for car-  rying it out. She made a party, inviting all her aris- tocratic associates who had taken part in calumniating her; and also such of her friends as she chose to let into the secret, and who consented to assist her in car- rying out the joke. In the meantime, she gave out  -4 word that a titled foreigner, youthful and handsome, and of great wealth and distinction, was to be in at- tendance on the occasion. And for this distinguished individual, Orlando, in'suitable disguise, was to be  passed off.  When the appointed evening arrived, the invited guests assembled in due time, and waited in anx- ious expectation, the arrival of the notable personage, who was to be the lion of the occasion. "Who say you is to be our honored guest to-night?" inquired Mr. Delmont of his lady, in a whisper. "And so little attention have you given to the im- portant occasion, my husband " replied she; "why Count Napier." 102   THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.     103 "Count Napier I Who in the name of wonder is he V" "You've often read of him, I dare say.'" "Read of him? the mischief! not I." "All the world should know who Count Napier is."  "If there's a Count Napier on this great globe, my dear, I've had no account of him before." "He might be a very important gentleman, for all that, Mr. Delmont. Alnora had the good fortune to make his acquaintance, providentially, it may be; and I trust something may come of it." "Where and when, pray, did this happen?" "As to that, she leaves us to conjecture. Wherefore, I know not; but it's just like her?". Grandfather Bluster, now coming up, slily touched Delmont on the shoulder, exclaiming, in a shrill whis- per: "A French Count! only think of it; and rich as the mines of California! Alnora, it seems, has taken a great fancy to him-isn't that a miracle? If she but hitch on to a Count, Mardell may go,- since she despi- ses him so." "Poh!" replied Delmont. "Thus it is, you devour everything by a greedy anticipation; better wait with patience, the development of events ." Uncle Jack, narrowly observing Delmont's manner grew fearful that he suspected something; and turning to George Fleetwood, who was also in the secret, said: "4I'm confounded fearful Delmont will see the coach- man 'in the Count." "Too well disguised is he; the devil wouldn't take him for the same," replied Fleetwood.    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5840-00000053"/> -404 THE WY    WORLD GoE Cs. "Uncle Jack," said Alnora, aside, "it's time for Or-  lando to come in."  "You mean the Count; make no mistake."         "I'll beware. Go notify him all's ready." "I will. Stand you near the threshhold to receive  and introduce him." While this private conversation was going on be- tween those who were privy to the plot, there was a promiscuous talking among the guests generally. "I'm growing impatient," said Miss Jinks, "I do wish the Count would come." "I'm perfectly on nettles to have a sight of him,"  observed Miss Ivy. "If he should turn out as hand- some as Alnora represents, I'll be smitten, sure-and make love to him instanter."  "I may be before you in that," remarked a third, "but I doubt not, Alnora's ahead of us all." "Ah, but she loves the coachman," whispered Miss Jinks, in an insinuating tone, accompanied by a wink and a sneer. "She hasn't the taste to appreciate a man of dignity," remarked Miss Ivy; "I doubt whether she could discern  the difference between a coachman and a Count." At this juncture, a servant came in, announcing the  Count. "Let him enter," said Bluster, in a very important  tone. Perfect stillness now prevailed, while eagerness and curiosity stood on tiptoe. Orlando having doffed his coachman's livery, was superbly dressed in a suit. of black. Upon his lip was   THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.     105 pasted a huge moustache, that gave him quite a foreign air ; and having been supplied with jewelry by Alnora, he was well bespangled. With proper ceremony and becoming hateur, he now made his appearance. Al nora, advancing, took him by the hand, remarking as she did so, "We were growing almost impatient, Count." Then turning to the company, said: "Count Napier, ladies and gentlemen."All rising, they bowed with profound respect.          . "Now we'll see what we'll see," whispered Uncle Jack to George Fleetwood. Delmont,-coming forward, took the stranger-by the hand. "My father, Count Napier," said Alnora. "Happy to see you, Count," said Delmont, coolly, each bowing. "My Mother."Count bowed to Mrs. Delmont, who, advancing wlth a queenly air, took his hand, saying- "We rejoice, C6unt, to make your acquaintance." Next came old man Bluster, who, grasping his hand warmly, said- "Worthy Coun, we are highly hon- ored."                 ,: "Say rather, I am highly honored," returned the Count. "Ah, sir, you were born to wear brighter honors than we are able to confer." "For once," remarked Uncle Jack, aside, "the old blunderbuss stumbled on the truth." "You Americans in your too great generosity, are wont to spoil us foreigners."    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5840-00000054"/> 106    THE WAY TILE WORLD GOES.  "'Hang me," whispered George to Alnora, "if he don't play the Count pretty well, for a coachman. Nor  :i does any one seem to entertain the slightest suspicion  touching his pretensions."' "I don't much like," observed Uncle Jack, "the way Delmont looks out from the corner of his eye." "Count," said grandfather Bluster, leading up Al- nora's aversion, "this is Mr. Mardell, the principal banker in our city."They shook hands with cold for- mality; and soon all were seated, and a promiscuous conversation commenced. "What a splendid looking man he is!" remarked Miss Ivy to Mrs. Delmont. "You may well say so," answered Mrs. D. "See  what a noble form, he has; and what an expansive, towering forehead." "And what an eye!) "Piercing as an eagle's. Then observe his princely bearing, and the majesty there is in his look!" "It takes dame nature, and the right kind of a moth- er," whispered Uncle Jiack, "to make a true nobleman." "At a glance," resumed Mrs. Delmont, after a little  pause, "one can see he's a man of high birth and fin- ished education." 'If she but knew he were the coachman," said Uncle Jack to himself, "what a different aspect he'd put on! her eyes would behold in him nothing noble, qaught to admire; and how different a report her tongue would make!" "That Miss Jinks," whispered Miss Ivy, "see-how     THE WA- THE WORLD GOES.     1 forward she is! What a desperate effort she's making to monopolize the Count's attention." "I wish she'd not been invited," responded Mrs. Del- mont, "the Count will think we Americans know noth- ing about good breeding." "Grandfather," said Uncle Jack, aside, "what's your opinion of the Count? and how like you him?" "He's a man all over, sir," promptly answered Mr. Bluster, "and might have been a king I He's just such a man as I would select for my granddaughter, provided she had ambition sufcient to aspire so high." "Now, sir, consider, and be candid, were he stripped of his title, and his wealth, what then? Think you he'd still wear the stamp of nobility?" "Undoubtedly, undoubtedly I it's in him, sir, it's in him." "Ah, how easy it is, for rank and titles to blind and deceive us!" "A man of my discernment, sir, is never deceived in a man-never, sir, never!" "Had you met this same ostentatious Count in the livery of an humble coachman, I'll wager you'd seen in him nothing to admire; could have discerned no traces of noble blood: he'd been a coachman, nothing but a coachman; nor would you have dreamed that nature ever intended him for anything more. Besides, you would have esteemed him presumptuous in at- tempting to aspire to anything higher. I've seen it so; 'tis the way the world goes."    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5840-00000055"/> 108    TiE WAY TIE WORLD GOES.             4                     .     I "There's no use talking to such a dolt ;" and turning f away, the old man addressed himself to Mardell, saying: "What think you, sir, of the Count?" "We Americans make great fools of ourselves," an- swered he, "in flattering foreigners at such a rate." "He's jealous," said the old man, turning to Mrs. Delmont, "afraid the Count will cut him out." "Molley, now coming in from the kitchen on an er- rand to Mrs. Delmont, chanced to fix her eyes upon the Count-stopping a moment to stare, she cried out in her simplicity: "La, sakes! if there ain't Orlando, dressed up fine as a gentleman I Hoo, hoo I and a great patch of home- made whiskers stuck under his nose!" "You simpleton!" exclaimed Mrs. Delmont, "hold your tongue; that's the Count." "Count fiddlesticks! can't fool me," said the girl, confident they were attempting to play off a joke at her expense. "Go back to the kitchen, you idiot!" stormed grand-  l daddy Bluster. But the servant heeding not the old   e man's command, sauntered towards the Count for the    purpose of scrutinizing him more closely.  "That hair brained Moll,'? said Uncle Jack to Alno- ra, "may expose the whole affair; I must get after her." And following her round, he directly caught her eye, and made signs for her to go out. But the domestic, taking every thing as intended to fool her, grew angry; and after making a mouth at Uncle Jack, said, spite-   THE WAY TE WORLD GOE.       109 fully: "'Tis Orlando, so it is; and that's Alnora's gold chain he's got on." "The saucy imp!" exclaimed Bluster. "What can she mean?" "Alnora's gold chain, did she say " inquired Mrs. Delmont, with a look of wonder and amazement. "Could such a thing be possible?" queried Bluster. "Impossible! impossible!" cried Mrs. Delmont, be- coming excited, and evidently growing a little suspi- cious.  "Upon my soul, H-I-" stuttered the old man. "What, what?" demanded Mrs. D., half divining the cause of his embarrassment. '" begin to doubt him," replied Bluster. "Mooll is about fool enough," he continued, "to see straighter than any of us." "But how could a rustic put on such thorough bred airs?" said Mrs. D. "See how all our guests are taken with him; and every unmarried woman is evidently smitten. But O, dear me, if he should turn out an im- postor-" iHere her voice faltered, and her breath failed. "I begin to see in him a look very much like the coachman," avered the old gentleman, eyeing the Count narrowly. "Don't say so," cried the lady, in a suppressed voice; "you frighten me out of my senses" " "If we're imposed on, I intend to know it.!" said Bluster, resolutely; "I'll take a peep at his gold chain; if it's Alnora's, then we're hoaxed, and she's had a He    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5840-00000056"/> "O    Tm WAY TH E W  WORLD GOES. hand in it." Then calling out in aloud voice, he said:  "Will the Count please walk this way?" "Don't, for gracious sake," entreated Mrs. D.; "I'll faint." "Keep still" said the old man, "I'll make excuse to show him a picture I have here." And taking a min- iature from his pocket, he remarked to the Count as he approached: "Here, sir, is the likeness of a rich relation, who, in his last moments, made me heir to his estate." "Indeed, sir,', answered the count, taking the minia- ture to look at it, "then 'twas not so hard to bear the bereavement; but harder, perhaps," he added, "to make a show of sadness at the funeral."      Now while the Count looked at the picture, grand- father Bluster, eye-glass in hand, eagerly scrutinized the glittering chain that encircled his neck and bosom. "For decencie's sake, don't stare so," whispered Mrs. Delmont to Bluster. "An interesting face!" remarked the Count, glancing first at the miniature, then at the old man's phiz; "A  very peculiar expression," he added, with a significant intonation, looking alternately at the picture, then at the old gentleman, who still examined the chain, and seemed to be growing more and more excited over it. Uncle Jack, perceiving his increasing agitation, ap- proached him, and in a low voice, said: "Grandfather, in the name of Jehosiphat, don't stare your eyes out I The Count will think you never saw a gold chain before."   THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.      1" "I've seen this one before; Satan pickle me if I hav- en't!" cried the old man, in a fury. "I'd swear to it," he continued, "on a stack of bibles as high as our church steeple!"Now clapping his glass again to his eye, he looked the Count intentiyin the face some mo- ments without winking or moving a muscle. The Count returned his stare with a comical twinkle. The old man at length becoming satisfied that he recognized the coachman, exclaimed, at the top of his voice: "A vile impostor! Ladies and gentlemen, we're imposed upon; this fellow's a counterfeit Count! No body but Orlando, our coachman?". "The tremendous sensation created by this declara- tion, and the terrible scene of confusion that at once ensued, can be more easily imagined than described. "Oh, my Lord!" shrieked Mrs. Delmont, throwing up her hands and flying from the apartment. Miss Ivy almost swooned; and Miss Jinks was near going into hysterics. "Death to the impostor!" cried Mardell. The guests generally, were now seized with con- sternation, at the idea of blood being shed, and rushed helter skelter from the chamber into other apartments. Those who were not frightened out, followed after to enjoy the sport. The Count finding himself left alone in his glory, directly broke forth in hearty peals of laughter; then growing serious, he thus soliloquised  "Ah! such is bubble reputation -a breath makes it; a breath brakes it, and 'tis gone!

But a few moments had elapsed after Un6el: Jack's aparture, when Mardell, pistol in hand, entered the rlor, followed by grandfather Bluster the latter cry- g, "Shoot him! shoot him!"' The banker presented 3 revolver, pointing it at Orlando's breast. Alnora, lick as thought rushed between them; and speaking ith all the energy of her soul, said: "Coward? assassin!

At this moment, George Fleetwood, who had been:r t to procure a weapon; came dashing in, and giving. 'lando a pistol, told him to defend himself.

Mardell, perceiving that Orlando was now armed,  rave back, and attempted to shield himself behind  George; the latter, quickly stepping aside, bid the par- ies take open ground; "Now a fair exchange of shots!" he said cooly. Orlando advanced, presenting his revolver; but the banker's courage having all oozed out he again re- treated, dodging behind Bluster. "Are you a coward '" bawled the old man; at the same time catching hold of the dastard, thrust him for- ward. "Are you ready?" demanded Orlando, pointing his  pistol again.  I I, -I!" stammered the terrified banker, quaking -from head, to foot, and trying to get away; but the old  man held him to it, assuring him, that he'd got to shoot, or be shot. Orlando finding there was no dan- ger in the fellow, concluded to fire above his head; at the discharge of his piece, his antagonist fell; and for a time was thought dead; but no wound being discov- ered upon his person, restoratives were applied, and he was at length brought back to consciousness; but for -long time refused to be convinced that the contents of Orlando's pistol had really missed him.   CHAPTER X. Alnora's parents now suspecting her of an intention to elope with Orlando, determined on sending her to- England to reside with her father's relatives. And to make sure she did not escape before the time fixed upon for embarkation, they took the precaution to look- her up in her chamber. Orlando no longer being allowed to come upon the premises, all further intercourse between the lovers was consequently cut off. Susanna, who was still at Delmont's in the capacity of a domestic, being disposed in every way possible to befriend Alnora, managed to convey intelligence to Orlando, respecting her imprisonment, and the plan on foot, for their final separation. Upon receiving the news, Orlando hastened to Un- cle Jack for counsel, flily resolved in his mind, by some means, to defeat the scheme of his adversaries, and rescue the object of hislove. "By heaven," he said to himself, "she'll not go against her will! I'll lose the last drop of blood .in my veins first!"A Upon finding Uncle Jack, he learned it was further planned, in relation to Alnora, that Mardell should fol- low her to England, and proffer to bring her home again, upon the condition that she consent to marry him. "5 ,1    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5840-00000061"/> "6    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES. "E're that shall be," declared Orlando, "I'll do des- perate deeds?" 'Tis possible I think, without rash measures, to de-  feat their aims;" remarked Uncle Jack, "and now  let me propose a scheme which I'm confident will suc- ceed."  "Let me hear ;" said Orlando, eagerly. "I'll go to Delmont's at night-fall-having, by the way, previously apprised Susanna of my intentions; and concealing myself from observation, under the shadow of a weeping willow in the back yard, I'll watch an opportunity to enter the house stealthily, and some where secrete myself till all are asleep. The family usually perch upon the marble steps in front, about twilight to enjoy the cool air; that will afford me an opportunity to enter unobserved through one of the back- doors." "And what will that avail, even if you succeed in escaping observationS " inquired Orlando, "Alnora's chamber door will be locked, and the key gone; be- sides, the domestics I understand, are also locked in their rooms during sleeping hours, to prevent them from lending assistance to any one who might attempt to let Alhora out."  "Let me further develope my plan ;" said Uncle Jack. "At a given hour of the night, say about twelve o'clock,  you and George Fleetwood, shall be at the outer door, which I, being within, can unbolt, and admit you. This done, we may proceed to the chamber where Al-   THE WAY TnT WORLD GOES.     " nora's imprisoned, and uniting our strength, suddenly force the door, and bear her away." "The thing is possible ;" said Orlando, "and being possible, we'll make it a certainty. But go we pre- pared for the worst; should we encounter opposition, desperate measures may become necessary. Rather than fail, I'm ready for the most desperate." Deciding upon the erliest possible time for making trial of their plot, the two separated, each charging the other to be punctual, and to leave nothing undone that might facilitate the accomplishment of their designs. *   o    k   -    *      -  * Courteous reader, if not yet weary of my story, you will now please accompany me to an humble cottage in a sequestered part of the city, where reside the wid- owed mother, and only sister of Orlando Hazleton. A benevolent looking, kind hearted, old fashioned lady, is Mrs. Hazleton. Though plainly dressed, her apparel is neat and unsoiled. Her hands bear the marks of toil, yet upon her brow you read contentment. Htr daughter, whose name is Eveline, looks a sweet rosy girl of sixteen; and seems, like her mother, satis- fied to be humble and unknown. The evening had arrived for the contemplated-elope- ment; but Orlando had kept the whole matter secret from his mother and sister. It was growing dark; Mrs. Hazleton stood in her cottage door, looking anx- iously in the direction she expected every moment-to see her son.      -  "What can detain Orlando? he promised to be home    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5840-00000062"/> U18  * THE WAY TE WORLD GoEs., for tea," she said, in a tone of disappointment. "Ah, he comes; 'tis his walk. My son we've been waiting supper more than an hour." "I was unexpectedly detained mother;" answered Orlando, "nor can I now stop long enough for tea; a friend waits to see me, with whom I have business."  "Brother, you seem excited;" said Eveline, "some- thing I'm sure has occurred to disturb you." "Been walking briskly," he replied evasively, "that's the excitement." "Something more than that; come, tell me." "Nonsense! what an imagination you have!" Say- ing which he turned about to depart. "You shall not go Orlando," protested Eveline, at the same time laying hold of him playfully, "till you let me know what's the matter." "Well, if you must know, its but a little affair of love." "Love! it can't be that you're in love Orlando"  Said his sister, laughing. "What about it my son 2" asked his mother serious- ly, has it brought out into some difficulty? Your look seems to say so." Orlando hesitated, and seemed for a moment lost in melancholy thought. "Who do you love, my son?" continued the old lady, "you need   i not fear to tell your mother and sister."' "I love Alnora Delmont," he at last replied. "Alnora Delmont?" said Eveline, in a tone of sur-i prise, and with a look of astonishment. "Orlando, Orlando," repeated his mother, "that an 7 7[   "HE WAY THE WORLD GoEs,.    I1a will not do my son, that will not do. Remember you're but the son of a poor widow; Alnora's the :daughter of a wealthy merchant. . "And what of that mother?" "Too unequal are you in the circumstances of life." "Should she be disinherited, which I presume will be the case, then we'Ul be equal in that respect." "An heiress marry her father's coachmana!" ex, claimed Eyeline, "why brother the whole world would be astounded!" "What care I for that? As to what the hollow-heart- ed world may say is nothing to me." "But to have people wondering and gossiping about a thing so strange and uncommon!" "I've lived to see that wealth and a name, are more in the world's estimation, than sterling merit, and highest moral worth. Heart and brain are nothing in the balance against gold. True, Pm the son of a poor widow; but of my mother I'm not ashamed. Better blood runs not in the veins of queens. If my occupa- tion's an humble one, its honest." "But know thou my son," said the mother, "the rich are powerful; make them enemies, and they will crush you."      : "Ah, 'tis an evil i've seen under the sun, that the poor are scarce less willing to bend the knee to the rich, than the rich are to have them do it."'

The sun, the moon, and the stars, shine as brightly for me, as for them. The birds warble as sweetly in my ears, as in theirs; and nature every where has as many charms for the poor as for the rich." "I grant brother, that by nature you're as good as they are; but nobility of nature will never in the world's estimation, redeem you from the disgrace of being -oor." ' "A fearful infatuation my son," said Mrs. Hazleton, "allures you to the brink of ruin. Delmont will never consent for you to marry his daughter; he'd sooner  surrender to you his life. I entreat you give it up; drop the matter where it is; I know by persisting you will get into trouble; for you must encounter formida- ble and fierce opposition. Better not rouse the lion from his lair; another step may plunge you into a whirl-pool of tribulation." "Let the worst come to the worst, I'll go forward if the stars fall!'

It was in the dusk of the evening,-the street lamps were not yet lit up; a dim light flickered in the hall of Delmont's mansion; the family, with the exception of Alnora, and one of the domestics, had collected on the verandah to enjoy the cool evening breeze. Their Conversation was low and sad; a listner might have thought they had just returned from a burial, and left in the cemetary the dearest idol of their hearts. At this hour, a crouching figure might have been seen enter the mansion through aback door, and glide stealthily across the floor. "This way, Uncle Jack," whispered a soft voice, "I'll deposite you in a closet up stairs." "Hark! Susanna," said the individual addressed, "I hear footsteps in the hall." "Conceal yourself Uncle Jack; quick! here, hide behind the ottoman." He obeyed, but not in time en- tirely to escape observation. "Who did I see here just now " demanded Mrs. Delmont, entering the parlor, and looking about, as if  expecting to find some one concealed. "Who-?" replied Susanna, affecting surprise, "you saw me I suppose." "My eyes could not have deceived me, I plainly saw the figure of a man." "You frighten me! Could it have been a ghost?" 122   HE WAT THE WORMD GoES.      123 "'Tis very mysterious; I saw no one go ,out; the gliding figure seemed to vanish like the shadow of a dissolving cloud." "If you'd only seen what I saw last night," remark- ed Susanna, breaking off in the middle of the sentence, as if too much terrified to go on.. "What-what did you see?" eagerly enquired Mrs. Delmont. "Don't ask me," replied-Susanna, affecting to be se- rious. "I must not frighten you."' "Gracious heaven!" exclaimed the excited lady, "I verily believe the house is haunted." Grandfather Bluster coming in at the moment, said: "What'sthe matter? whats the matter?" "Oh, we've seen a ghost i" answered -Mrs. Delmont, gasping for breath. "A ghost poh! I wouldn't wonder if there was some plot going on, and Uncle Jack at the bottom of it." "I wish old Bluster were at kingdom come!" whis- pered Uncle Jack, to himself. "But the plagues of tihe earth are even longer lived than its blessings. While the devil owes heaven a spite, there'll still be a Bluster." The parlor lamp was now lighted, and the outer doors locked. Soon after, Delmont came in, having just visited Alnora's apartment; taking a seat near his lady, he said:-  "A strange infatuation! I'm bewildered and con- founded! It surpasses my comprehension, that our    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5840-00000065"/> 14   : THE WAY THE WORLD GOES. daughter should prefer an humble coachman to a weal- thy banker."' "Have you sounded her mind further," inquired Mrs. Delmont, 'upon the subject of going with her  uncle to England.", "I alluded to it, but she was silent and made no reply." "'Tis a great trouble," growled Bluster, 'pity Mar- dell had'nt shot the coachman, as he came near doing." "When one is shot, and the other hanged, no doubt the play will end," responded Delmont. "No danger of a banker being hanged for killing a coachman? rejoined the old man. "Always give me a fool," whispered Uncle Jack to himself, "to echo popular sentiment."  "Better retire soon Susanna," said Mrs. Delmont  "that you may rest well, and rise early; I want break- fast betimes in the morning, for Alnora and her uncle will embark early; they sail for England to-morrow."  Susanna went to her room, but trembling with fear lest Uncle Jack should yet be discovered before all retired. In gloomy silence, broken only by an occasional-re-  mark, the three sat till the clock struck twelve. "We may as well all retire," remarkedI Delmont rising,: "see that Alnora wants nothing, and be sure  that her chamber door is left secure; and handing his wife the key of the prisoner's apartment, he withdrew. "She's already supplied with every thing necessary," said Mrs. Delmont, "I'd rather not see her again to or                   \    Tir WAY Th WOpRLD GOSS.    !25 night; 'twould only make me feel more uncomforta- ble."Saying which, she threw the key on the centre table, and followed her husband. Grandfather Bluster now rising, said to himself:- "I must go see that Susanna's locked up; no telling what plots she may be contriving. Ah! this is a troublesome world." "If you don't get to a worse one, old boy," solilo- quised Uucle Jack, behind the ottoman, "the: devil will be cheated, and hell defrauded." And now crawling out from his hiding place, soon as the sound of the old man's footsteps had died away, he said: "Thank heaven! I breathe freer. And s good for- tune would have it, she's left the prison key!" at the same time snatching it up off the table, and proceeding towards Alnora's apartment, saying as he went: "Now is the winter of my discontent made glorious summer." Upon reaching her door, he rapped gently, to which she immediately responded, not having yet gone to rest. Unlocking her door, he whispered a few words into her ear, then hastily went to the front outer door, which he unbolted, and on opening found Orlando and George in waiting. As they entered, Alnora came out of her chamber, exclaiming: "Freedom once more!" "See, the bird has escaped from its cage l"-said Un- cle Jack. Orlando met, and embraced her with deep emotion.    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5840-00000066"/> 126    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES. * Make no delay;" remarked George Fleetwood, "discovery might give us trouble." "So it might ;" said Alnora, "we'll hasten our de- parture." All the rest going out, Uncle Jack remained to bolt the front door, and to place every thing just as it had been left by Mrs. Delmont; having accomplished this, he made his exit through a back window, saying as he touched the ground--"May heaven speed'what has been so well begun." *    *     *             * On the following morning the Delmont family were astir at an early hour. Susanna, full of anxiety, and not knowing what had happened during the night, embraced the first opportunity of rapping at Alnora's chamber door; getting no response she said: "Thank heaven, she's out sure's I live." 'It's a trial," remarked Mrs. Delmont, as Susanna entered the sitting-room where she was, "to have Al- nora go so far away; but who knows-in England she may marry a nobleman." "If she has'nt already married one of nature's noble- men," said Susanna, mentally, "'tis because they found no clergyman last night."Now speaking aloud, she said mischievously: "tHow would you like to have her marry a Count?"  "Hold your tongue, you jadet never presume to  say Count in my hearing, it makes me furious!" "I'm sure Count Napier dazzled you all." "Be silent, I bid you!"   Tm TH T E   W THWORLD 'ESGo  2i "'Shall we have breakfast right away'" tinqutied Delniont, coming in after having completed his toilet. "Directly;" replied his lady. "Susanna go waken Alnora." -  "I scarce can brook the thought," remarked Delb mont, "of her going to England."  "Circumstances render it necessary;" said his wife; "Absolutely necessary," chimed in grandfather Blus. ter, who had just come in. A servant now entered announcing Mardell. "Admit him;" said the old gentleman. Delmont frowned, but said nothing; and when the banker was ushered in, he received him politely, but with a de- gree of coolness that was by no means flattering. Susanna, coming in directly after Mardell was seated, informed Mrs. Delmont that she'd rapped on Alnora's door, but received no-answer. "So soundly does she sleep?" said Mrs. Delmont; and handing to the domestic the key of Alnora's apart- ment, bade her go in and rouse her. "Say to her," cried Bluster, "that Mr. MardelI:has called to take leave of her, before she's up." "No," said Mardell, "I've called to say that my mind's made up to accompany her to England."' "Indeed I indeed?" said the old man, "I trust then she'll be more reconciled to go." Susanna, having been again to Alnora's chamber, returned with the astounding intelligence that the prisoner was not to be fouud, It's quite impossible to conceive the utter astonisli    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5840-00000067"/> 328    fT mE WAY TUE Wo0w GCos. ment thi announcement created. After a breathess silence of some moments, Delmont said: "Can it be possible she has eloped"            "Good heavens!" cried his lady, frantic with the flithougt. t                  '     , "My Lord!" exclaimed Bluster, "we're disgraced forever Confusion! distraction! The devil's had a   hand in it. How can it be otherwise Her cham- ber door was locked, and the key laid on the table, and there 'twas found this morning; and the outer doors were all bolted, none of them, it seems have been bro- ken open. Depend upon it, there's a wonderful mays- tery about it."' "No doubt," said Mardell, "she has eloped with the base born coachman."  "It must be so ;" said Mrs. Delmont, "let them be pursued. Delay not a moment, -Mr. Delmont." "Take a revolver with you," advised Mardell, "and blow the villain's brains out." "There's no use being headlong in the affair," ob- served Delmont, "AIlnora's of age; and if already wed- ded to him, there remains but one way for us, besides that of leaving her to her fate." "Talk not of leaving (her: to her fate ," said Mrs. Delmont, "we'll never submit to such a disgrace. But pray what other alternative is there." "We may alledge insanity; pretend she has lost her reason; that substantiated, will, in the eyes of the law be sufficient cause for setting aside the marriage, if in- deed it has already taken place."

"Ho, ho!" he shouted, "here I am bright and early; come to bid good bye to Alnora, whom I hear is this day to embark for England.

Ah-' so. goes the world." Now turning suddenly to Mrs. Delmont he said gaily: 'How are you cousin? Ive not had the pleasure of seeing you before, since the memorable night of the party, when Count Napier turned all our heads'."  "I'm in no humor for jesting ;7' she tartly replied. "Uncle Jack," aid Delmont, "we are all sadly per- p'exed to day." "It perplexes me to hear you say- so;" returned Uncle Jack, putting on innocent looks. "Ou'r daughter Alnora is lost."  "Lost? howV? not committed suicide 2" "Worse! worse!" exclaimed Bluster, "far worse, eloped with a villian."

"We are officers of the law-and have been com- manded to take into custody Miss Alnora Delmont." "There's no such person here, gentlemen," said Al- nora, advancing towards them. , "Youir pardon, madam,' returned the officer, "we  recognize in you, the individual mentioned in the writ."  4My name is Alnora Hazleton." "But we are instructed to serve the writ upon you as Alnora Delmont, recognizing you by no other name." "I'm not without proof sirs, of my late lawful mar- riage to Mr. lHazleton." "You may not be aware madam, that insanity is alledged against you, as the cause of your strange conduct in this ill assorted marriage." "Very extraordinary indeed, is this proceeding; but since you claim to be officers of the law, it becomes my duty to submit, relying upon law and justice for protection." "My God?" exclaimed Orlando, springing to his feet, "what means this villainous conduct? Fraud, falsehood,- and perjury, are now to do their worst? 'Tis a hellish scheme, meant but to separate us, and blast forever our hopes of happiness! By heaven, 'll not tamely submit to it!

It was midnight in New York; Mardell, had yet escaped the vigilence of the police, and found his way into the back room of a miserable rum shop in the vi- cinity of the Five Points. He sat upon a stool near an old rickety table, orna- mented with a bottle and tin-cup. Though much in- toxicated, his mind seemed to be seriously pondering over his late misfortunes. "Curse upon the dire mchane,he muttered, "that brought my well planned villainy to lightly  Aye, betrayed by treacherous accomplices; entoiled; now, even hell itself deserts me, and that when most of all I need fell devise and diabolic aid. With such an infernal plot, I thought sure the devil would help me out." At this moment, a ragged, gallows looking fellow entered, unobserved by Mardell, and paused to hear what the inebriate was saying to himself. "Well;well," continued the villain, "New York's not all the world; outside of it I'll find room to bus- tle. To-morrow, aye to-morrow, 11 weigh anchor, shake hands with this accursed spot of earth, and bid good bye to the more accursed wretches that crawl upon it. Yes I'll go to-morrow." "If bars and bolts hinder, you not," spake the list- ener. 136   THE WAY THE WORLD GOES.     13T "Starting to his feet with consternation, Mardell looked wildly about, till his eyes fell upon the intru- der, whom he directly recognized; at once dismissing his fears, he said: "Ho, ho! and is it you Zaro?" "'Tis I, why start you so ' "Upon my word, I thought my father had come." "Your father? ha! poor old man, he's long since gone to his grave, and sleeps as soundly in Pottersfield, as if you'd given him a decent burial." "I mean not him, but spake of another-my father below, that venerable old gentleman with horns." "Mistook me for his infernal majesty, eh I Do you pretend to say we look alike." "Father and son never resembled more." "You flatter me. But jesting aside, you were really frightened."  "To confess the honest truth Zaro, men there are in the city whom I care not to see. But no matter, tell me the news--have you any." "None to your ears welcome." "What is it, pray?" ) 'When the devil's to pay, 'tis indeed time to pray."5 "His devilship, I nothing owe."  "In his service you've worked well I own; and no doubt will one day be rewarded with-a tail; should your master have none other to bestow, he may do you the honor to unscrew his own." "Tell'me at once Zaro, what's in the wind." "Something beside fragrant odors." 12    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5840-00000072"/> 138    THE W'AY THE WORLD GOES. "Unsavory rumors afloat?"

"For villainous deeds, we must needs have villains." "But a villain may be too villainous.  '"I grant you, so these men have turned out. May they not go long unhung." "Now take the advice of a friend, and be off on the wings of the wind. From the penalty of the law, flight only can save you." "I'll take your counsel; and have only to say, in the language of Lord Byron's affectionate adieu to Lon- don: "Farewell damned town." "Saying which, he started for the door, but was caused to halt by an exclamation from Zaro, who said: "Hark! what noise is that? Police! police! scam- per! scamper!' Confused by the sudden alarm, Mardell, instead of running out, darted, under the table, and sat squat, like a toad. Zaro receding into a cqner, stood mo- tionless; two officers entered; and after looking round a moment espied Zaro. "Ah, here's a man, or a statue;" said one to the other. o    "Say stranger, have you seen about here to-night a fellow named Mardell ". "Mardell? who is he? inquired Zaro in a tone of indifference  . "Late the rich banker, so considered of Wall street; but formerly, a kind of one horse lawyer, infesting these parts, and generally known about the Fivq Points." "A sort of pestilential fellow, eh?" "A pestilence he is too,-worse than small-pox, cold plague or famine."  "What follows he now, his legal profession again?" "Were that all, le might in our warrant find a flaw, and prove himself a villain according to law.' Come Haller, let us go       * -  "Wait a moment, I'll search round a little here; the chap may be concealed," Mardell now began to quake, making sure he'd di- rectly be discovered; but his friend Zaro hastened to divert the attention of the officers, by; saying: "Hold-hold a;moment; now I remember, by the way, 'tis reported, and may be true, a man hark you, of that very name, Mardell, I swear the same-on this present day, about night-fall, came to an untimely end." "Killed?" demanded the officer, 'Stabbed to the heart,"  "And died on the spot?"  "Immediately expired--spake not a wod," "Where happened it, and how "    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5840-00000073"/> U^0    TmnI WAY THm WORLD GOES.- '"n someocoffee-house; and about a game of euchre." "I'll venture," said one to the other, "that's the man we're after."' "I'll warrant 'tis. Stranger, heard you anything farther concerning the fellow?"'  ; 'Only, that he'd been charged with having com- mitted a forgery, and that the police were after him." "The very samel" exclaimed the officer, turning towards the door. "Then give yourselves no further trouble," said Zaro, "in the clutches of the devil, he's already safe." 4Aye, aye," responded the officer, "Old Nick's got his own, at last; homeward let us return to rest." -a tthat! ha a!?" laughed Zaro, soon as the police- men were out of hearing, "not a bad- invention, to thwart a good intention." "Confound me if I count it good ;" responded Mar- dell, "with very fear and dread they froze my 'blood!" "Now my good fellow," said Zaro, "make straight skirts for Texas, Mexico, or some other infernal place." "So I will ;" he replied, at the: same time siezing his bottle, said: "One more smack; thank heaven the hounds are off the track!" Just as the bottle-reached: his mouth, the officers- suddenly re-appeared. "Ah!" exclaimed the foremost, "but here's the fel- low's ghost. Sure the devil's lost his roast." Dropping his bottle, and plunging out through, a side window, Mardell gave leg-bail. The officers pur- sued with all possible speed, but were distanced in the chase.   CHAPTER XIV.' -We now return to a further account of the unfortu- nate Alnora.  After much ado on the part of her -parents-a long trial arid great expense, they utterly failed to make out her insanity; nevertheless, they refused to give her up to her lawful husband, until forced to, -by a writ of habeas-corpus. Shortly after her release, Uncle Jack called at Del- mnopts. When he entered the house, Grandfather Blus- ter, Mr. Delmont, and his lady, were sitting together: in gloomy silence, But nothing daunted, Uncle Jack put on his usual airs, and in-a tone of hilarity said :- 'Ho! ho! Hope I see you all happy!" "Little cause have you for such a hope ;" gruffly replied the old man. 'So much cause,") rejoined' Uncle Jack, "that 've come expressly to congratulate you." "Upon what in heaven's name?" demanded Mrs. Delnont, in-no amiable mood,  "On your great good fortune," answered Un cle Jack "in not being able to convict your daughter of insanity.' She has proved herself as I learn, of sound :mind. Happily, the precious girl, it seens, has escaped the hereditary taint of the family.  "Hereditary taint!"t exclaimed theI indignant lady, "what mean you sir '"           . . "1    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5840-00000074"/> "2    THE WAY THE WORLD GOES. "Ah, the sad infirmity of madness madam, which clings with such fatal tenacity to the Bluster blood." "Heaven give me patience!" cried the excited wo- man, springing to her feet, and running to the oppo- site side of the chamber to catch the fresh air from an open window; "if I only had breath," she gasped, "what a blowing up I'd give him!" "The reputation of our family's assailed!" vociferated the old man; "I call you to an account sir; the taint of madness-in our family, eh Presume you to say such a thing, vile calumniator? You shall answer for it, sir!" "Soundness of mind- in my family sir, may be tra- ced -t-raced-'"  "Within one of Alnora's grandfather ;" interrupted Uncle Jack. The old man now kindled to such a passion, that he could utter nothing more; and began to pace the floor in great agitation. "With good reason," remarked Delmont calmly, "we might all be charged with madness." "Let me now state a fact Mr. Delmont;" said Un- cle Jack, laying aside his sarcastic tone and manner. "Orlando Hazleton, is not in reality a coachman, but a mechanic-a first class carpenter; never drove a coach till you employed him. He first made the ac- quaintance of Alnora, while working on your new tenement; and for the sake of enjoying frequent inter- views with her, he sought, and obtained the situation of coachman."  g 7-   THE WAY THE Wom Dw GOES.'    14&amp; "That- surprises me, Uncle Jack;" responded Del.- mont, "and is he indeed that excellent carpenter, that I had employed on my new building?" "The very same."  "Mrs. Delmont," said he, turning to his wife, I; begin to think better of our son-in-law.'"  "'Tis not so bad his, being a mechanic," replied the lady, "but our daughter should have looked high- er than that." "Madam, forget not," remarked Uncle Jack, "that you are the daughter of a shoemaker." Had he hurl- ed at her a harpoon, he would scarcely have created a greater sensation; she shuddered but said nothing; and grandfather started nervously to his feet. "I mean no reproach, either to you or your father; apologized Uncle, Jack, "for there's nothing discreditable in being a shoemaker." "Why should there be 2" said Delmont. "Why sir, only think of it," further remarked Un- cle Jack humorously, "the shoemaker's the very foun- dation of society; we all stand upon the work of his hands. And but for the foundation, where would the superstructure be?" At this juncture, Billy Bogus, a clownish fellow, in Delmont's employ, came, in awk- wardly gazing round with his mouth open. Uncle Jack paused a moment to observe him, then went on. "Consider the shoe sir, it hath beauty as well as utility. Sir, I could show you, if it were not to reason too curiously, how even the toe of a shoe, might awaken new ideas in a man's mind: look at that '    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5840-00000075"/> I4'    THEi WAY THE :WORLD GOES. toe of mine sir; now observe one of its uses; and lifting his foot, he kicked Billy Bogus behind; which coming so unexpectedly, terribly frightened the clown, and sent him out in a canter. This gave occasion for a little merriment, all laughed, and sadness seemed at once to give place to good humor and cheerfulness. '"But now, let me come again to a more serious mood;" said Uncle Jack. "Depend upon it," he continued, "there's no use keeping up a family broil, unless forsooth, it be in the shape of: a roast turkey, pig,. goose, or some thing of that sort. Then conclude at once and forever to bury the tomahawk with Al- nora and Orlando. Smoke the pipe of peace, and for- get the past." "For one," answered Delmont, "I am willing." "What say you, Mrs. Delmont " demanded Uncle Jack, turning to the lady. After a moment's hesitation, she replied: "It might be better for us all." "Grandfather, do you consent." The old man made a serious pause; then in slow and measured accents, said: "But for good luck, which raised me from my hum- t ble calling, I might still -have been a shoemaker. At Orlando's age I was no better off in the world than he is. - Who knows but the poor fellow may one day climb as high, as I have? I can forgive and receive him." "Second sober thought" remarked Uncle Jack,   THE WAY THE W OBRL  GOje. 145 "sets right matiy wrongs. Say then,-I may go at onee, and invite them hither."  "Go,' said Delmont, "and by the way, give our compliments to Mrs. Hazleton and daughter, and bid them come with Orlando and Alnora,." Gladly will I obey your commands ;" said Uncle Jack, and immediately departed, "Come noW," said Delmont, rising, "we'll forget- our troubles, banish sorrow, and be happy." "So be it;"' responded his wife, "and with glad hearts, make ready to receive our children." "It will be a joyful occasion ;" added the old man. With great satisfaction, Alnora and Orlando received the intelligence of a reconciliation; and they hesitated not, to accept the invitation, conveyed through, the po- liteness of the warm-hearted, but eccentric Uncle Jack. On the evening of the same day, Orlando, aecompa- nied by his wife, mother and sister, might have been seen with cheerful faces, flowing spirits, and elastic step, making their way to the Delmont mansion, where they were all received with a hearty welcome. Grandfather Bluster and Mrs. Delmont, with over- flowing hearts, met them at the threshhold, -andre- ceived them with a joyful :greeting. Delmont the1 came forward, with his usual calmness and delibera- tion, and after politely greeting Mrs. Hazleton and daughter, he took Alnora by the hand, saying: "Welcome home dear daughter ;" now extending his other hand to Orlando, continued, "and since every 13    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5840-00000076"/> "6.

"Than this reconciliation," responded Orlando, "nothing on earth could give me higher satisfaction. The coneord of sweet sounds, is not more grateful to the ear, than are the voices of love and friendship to the heart. Doubly grateful become the latter, under circumstances like the present, when every note of dis- cord is drowned, and each jarring string attuned to divinest harmony."' Alnora, now addressing her father, said: In obeying the sared laws of love, I've been com- pelled -to disobey parental advice; you now forgive -the offence; I rejoiee in your forgiveness; and yet more rejoice that you also forgive him for whose sake I offended you, and with whom- my destiny for life is linked. I have seen that great marriages, such as the world calls great, are not always happy. An humble condition in life, such as the world calls humble, I pre- fer to splendid misery. And now, though I've not become the spouse of a Banker, nor of a Count, I am happy in being the wife of one on whom God hath set the seal, and placed the impress of true nobility."

"Forever adjust- ing your hair, perfuming, painting, powdering!' con- tinued the mother, in a tone of vexation, "Indeed my child I'm quite out of patience with you." "Now ma!" murmured Juliet, coaxingly, 'I must be a little particular you know.'  "A little particular! Ah, if that were all Juliet- but when it has come to this, that you study nothing but dress and flirtation, 'tis time for me to complain. Beaux balls, and parties, seem of late to occupy your mind from morn till night! -Then too, only think of the expenses, and how extravagant you are!" 'The pink of fashionable circles must be gay," re- plied the daughter, haughtily tossing her head, as she proudly surveyed herself in the looking-glass from top to toe. "Alas! Juliet, I fear the pink bath lost its sweet-. ness." "Well, well, though wanting its delicious perfume, I must look the pink still." And turning again to the mirror, the vain girl went on with her tedious labor at the toilet.

"'Tis serious, I know not why, but-the more I fix, the more I am un1fixed!" said the daughter fidgeting, and- again changing the style of her flowing tresses. "When I'm anxious to appear the best, then I'm sure to look the worst. These curls are so provoking! I've combed, twirled, and twisted them, a thousand ways; nor do they suit me yet!" "Little wonder; having adjusted them for the thou- sandth time, 'tis hardly to be expected your whimsical taste will at last be satisfied." "This-paint makes such a daubing!"

Juliet Foxglove, though light hearted and vain, had many amiable traits of character; and indeed possess- ed the elements of a noble nature and a great soul. Her education, though considered liberal, had been of a light and frivolous character; which however, was less her own fault, than that of her parents and teach- ers. Mr. Foxglove, Juliet's father, who for several years was a money-broker in the Queen City, had rap- idly accumulated wealth, and maintained his family in circumstances of affluence and luxury. At-his death, which happened a few years prior to the date of our story, the estate not only ceased to augments but strait- way began rapidly to diminish; for Mrs. Foxglove as well as her daughter, had formed habits of extrava- gance which she found difficult to change, when neces- sity rendered frugality and a retrenchment of expenses needful; and while she preached economy to Juliet, denied herself no luxury, and was scarcely less fond of display than she. - A few brief years, and poverty was at their door; and with itsame anxiety, despond- ency and wretchedness. Ere thiskchange intheir cir- cumstances, however, Juliet had fully won the affec- tions of Stanly Woodbury, but mmanaged in t--e mean- time, to keep her own heart 'unenthralled.

CHAPTER III. "Say now, Bettie Blossom," said a young, gssip ing flirt, "do you really believe, that Stanley Wood- berry thinks of marrying that butterfly, Juliet Fox glove?" "Impossible!" exclaimed the young lady addressed, "he surely can't have such miserable taste. "So I think;" remarked Miss Nettles. "Did yon hear how the proud Foxgloves are com- ing down?" inquired Hattie Winkle, a bird of the same feather. "Why, no; but I've always expected it;" responded Miss Blossom. "They'll soon be flat enough; all their fine costly furniture, has to be sold to pay their debts." "You don't say!" cried Miss Nettles, while a gleam of malignant delight lit up her countenance. "I thought the whole city knew that; its in every body's mouth!" "La me!" said Miss Blossom, "Jule need'nt tr to hold up her head any longer." "Good enough for her ;" chimed in Molly Nettles, "she's been sailing round in fine feathers long enough." Thus the three gossips went oi, betraying anything but that amiable ind kindly spirit, which so becomes the female character.  In the midst of their conversation, a gentleman, fa- 157    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5840-00000082"/> 1-58    THE WHEEL OF FO1UNE, miliarly acquainted, with each one of them, entered the apartment; after the usual compliments, Miss Blossom observed: "I dare say Mr. Oliver, can tell us all about it. They -say the widow Foxglove is gone toi the wall, totally broken up; and that Jule's quite crestfallen, poor thing! I suppose her admirers will now be like an- gel's visits, few and far between." "The pecuniary circumstances of Juliet and her o- ther, replied Mr. Oliver, are truly distressing; but their misfortunes should not be reckoned criminal. Juliet mayr now have fewer admirers; btit she is none the Ieds worthy of being admired. She's not without her faults; yet it must be admitted the girl possesses many estimable qualities."'  "I can see nothing to recommend her, but poverty and pride ;" said Miss Winkle, in a Epiteful tone, and with no very amiable expression of countenance. "We are laZt liable to mishaps, and all have our fail- ings ;" rejoined Mr. Oliver. "I've no sympathy for such extravagant people ;" remarked Miss Nettles, "from plenty and luxury, they've suddenly come to beggary." "Truq, yet the problem's easily solved; 'tis ever the ease, that the rapid accumulation of wealth begets pro- digality and extravagance; and riches suddenly gained rarely fail to bewilder and intoxicate the mind of the possessor; hence the affluent, often come to' destitu- tion as rapidly as they rode to fortune. At Foxglove's' death, income ceased, and outlay   THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.      159 went on as before; poverty, was the inevitable conse- quence, and bankruptcy came unawares." "Well, I guess they'll not sail quite so high here- after ;" observed Hattie Winkle, with a significant toss of her head, and an air of exultation. "And- I imag- ine," she added, "her fondness for -flattery,. and love of praise, will now be rarely gratified'; that was- in- deed a-great weakness of hers." "A weakness, Miss Winkle, common to frail huma- nity," answered Oliver; '"even the world's great men, in all ages, have more or less, betrayed. the same -kind of weakness; the most illustrious have rarely been free from it; why then should we expect a pretty girl of seventeen to be superior to it, and have courageto turn a deaf ear to the honied' words-of-praise ,?"Saying which, Mr. Oliver withdrew, leaving the idle gossips to rattle their tongues uncontradicted.    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5840-00000083"/> CHAPTER IV. Shortly prior to the time Juliet and Stanley had agreed upon to consummate their union in holy wed- lock, there came a sudden crash among the banks; some failing, others temporarily suspending; and yet others, taking advantage of the panic, seized upon the opportunity, and closed without any intention of re- opening, or ever meeting their liabilities. Among this class, was the bank of Swindler and Co. The gen- eral excitement served them for a, pretext, and under color of self protection, they closed their doors, prom- ising depositors, however, to resume business soon as the panic wasover. The news of the suspension reached Stanley Wood- berry, soon after it happened; hastening to the spot, he found an immense concourse of excited men and women surrounding the bank. They were chiefly de- positors, consisting of merchants, farmers, mechanics, widows, orphans, and beggars. Here was Dives and Lazarus; and there the bejeweled nabob, who had his thousands in the closed vaults, crowding side by side with poor washer-women, whose little savings and hard earned shillings had been entrusted to the same treacherous hands. Anxiety was written upon every face-despair on some; a low, deep murmur, ran through the promiscuous crowd; none were bois- terous, but all gloomy and dissatisfied. Stanley for the 160   THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.      161 moment, forgot his own vexation and disappointment in listening to the misfortunes and distress of others. But complainings and denunciation, were of no avail, the law protected and justified the bankers in closing their doors. During the time allowed them for suspension, when none but Swindler &amp; Co. could know what was going on within the closed doors of the bank, they made good use of their opportunity for emptying the vaults, and conveying their valuable contents to a safe hiding place. After the lapse of some weeks, the public were cool- ly notified that an assignment had been made, and that depositors must wait till the affairs of the bank were properly adjusted, and the amount of the assets and liabilities ascertained. Months now passed before the real state of things was fully known to the public; but at length it came out that the liabilities were found greatly to exceed the assets. And now, the most that depositors had to expect, was to receive, in the course of a year or two,. a small portion of the sums they had deposited. Stanley Woodberry, though a young man of firmness and great energy of character, was much depressed by the loss he thus sustained. He flt the heavy stroke the more keenly, seeing it would necessarily cause some postponement of his contemplated nuptials. But the saddest stroke upon his heart, was yet to come; he was not long in perceiving that his loss had such an effect upon Juliet, as greatly to change her manner "    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5840-00000084"/> 62  Tim WHEEIL oF FORTUNE. towards" him. A constrained formalityi distance, and Coolness, directly began to be manifest ; this most un- looked f'or change in her demeanor, touched him deep- ly; and now yielding to discouragement, he grow dejected, and sunk into a repining, melancholy state 'of mindOud Juliet one day- in conversation with -her mother res- peethig Woodberry's pecuniary misfortunes, said: C41. like himllmuch, but really ea nnot think of niarry iug a poor man; rStanley's loss gives we sufficient rea- son for changing my mind." "Thten it was his -money, and not himself, that you loved?,"  replied Sr. Foxglove, in - a tone of sharp rebuke. 'Say, what Uo will, ma  oety puts out the fireS Of love."

While the two yet conversed, the ex-banker returned and alighted at his stately mansion, which stood in full view of the talkers, and went in. Stanley now proposed going immediately to call up- on him; saying: "As you are in hard circumstances, Mr. Rosindale, I'lldun him for you. The amount being small, pos- sibly he will pay it." "I've no faith in that," replied Rosindale, "but I have no objection to his being dunned." Proceeding at once to Swindler's residence they rang the bell, which immediately summoned a servant, who showed them into a parlor where Swindler was sitting. The young men walked in modestly, politely bowing to the banker as they entered. After introducing Rosindale, Stanley announced his own name. Swindler made a slight inclination of the head, but'deigned not to rise from his seat. A little stung by this discourtesy, Stanley remarked, by way of refreshing his memory-"We once had a financial transaction together, you no doubt remember, Mr. Swindler."  "Not the slightest recollection of you sir," was the gruff and uncivil reply. "A poor memory's sometimes convenient,"Stanley cuttingly remarked, "I chance to be," he continued, "one of the unfortunate depositors, -who suffered by the failure of your bank."   THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.     167 "Presume to insult me sir-and in my own house?" vociferated Swindler, kindling at once to a violent passion. "I insult no man who is a man," returned Stanley; "but waiving that matter, I entreat you listen to a brief statement in behalf of the young man who ac- companies me. He deposited in your bank the small sum of one hundred dollars, which never has- been re- turned to him. He is now in needy circumstances, and would be much obliged if you would accommodate him." "T is, is not my place of business, sir," abruptly answered the banker. "Please, then, inform us sir, where your place of business may be found." "For the present, it suits my convenience," replied Swindler, putting on a haughty air, "to suspend busi- ness." "I thought as much; then we are right in calling upon you at your residence. And let me hope sir, you will not decline accommodating my needy friend." "I can't bestow charity on everybody," he answered doggedly; and signifying by his manner that he was tired of their company. "No charity sir," returned Stanley, with warmth, "does he crave at your hands; he but demands his -own.  "Ill mannered dog!" exclaimed Swindler, "I'll take none of your insolence!" and springing to his feet,    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5840-00000087"/> 168    TH N WHEEL OF FORTUNE. reached for his cane that was lying on a table before him. Woodberry's blood now took fire, and quick as thought, he made a grab at Swindler ; the latter being in a stooping posture at the moment, his top knot ap- peared the most convenient point to fasten upon; and without pausing to consider whether the luxuriant growth that covered his pate was well rooted or not, he instantly seized him by the hair, and thought at a jerk to have brought him sprawling, to measure hisg length upon the floor; but unluckily, the shining locks yielded to his gripe, and to his amazement he found but a greasy wig in his hand,-and beheld, what looked, a bald-headed hobgoblin, starting back in terrible dismay. But Stanley's blood was up; not now was he to be detered by what might turn out a " raw head and bloody bones," charging upon the unwigged banker, he aimed to take him by the throat, but chanced to fasten on his cravat, which he soon found to answer equally well his purpose. Strong in grip, the young man brought the insolent nabob to his knees the first twist. But on seeing the fellow grow black in the face, while his eyes started from their sockets, he was touched with a feeling of pity, and immediately relaxing his hold a little, gave the strangled wretch a chance to breath. Swindler embracing the opportunity, which hethought might be his last, lustily cried-"Murder! Murder!" His wife, to whom he had been but recent- ly married, being in an adjoining room, heard the   "HE WHEEL OF TORTUIME.  terrific outcry, and came running into the parlor half frightened out of her wits. Stanley now gave the cravat another prodigous twist, which operated as a kind of stop-cock upon the' banker's bellowing; silence was thus again restored for a time; but what a spectacle was there forthe hort rifled eyes of Mrs. Swindler, so late a happy bride I Shrieking aloud she turned from the hideous sight, and made all possible haste back to her own apartment. After giving the fellow a good, wholesome choking,  Stanley and his friend took their departure, leaving the discomfited banker to moralize on the event at his- leisure. We return again to a further account of Juliet and her mother, whose circumstances were perpetually growing worse, and every day becoming more embar- rassed. "Alas, Juliet," said Mrs. Foxglove, in a despairing tone, ' I see not what's to become of us-poverty wretched, hopeless poverty is grinding us into the very dust. Can you not take a school, learn dress- making, or do something of that sort?" "Impossible, ma, impossible!" replied the daughter, in faltering tones, while tears filled her eyes, and be- gan to course their way down her pale cheeks. "Why impossible?" "I know not," sobbed Juliet, "but it just seems I can't. I wish I were different; but I cannot unmake 15    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5840-00000088"/> 1T0     THE WHEL OF FORTUNE. myself; pity you did not teach me to do something when I was younger." Like many other mothers have done, Mrs. Foxglove saw toolate her own faults and failings reflected in the character of her daughter. And now, when it was be- yond remedy, she deplored the false education by which her child was well nigh ruined, and left utterly unfitted for life's great battle. Juliet, was not by nature deficient either in physical or moral energy, but unhappily for her, these qualities had never been rightly developed, nor called into prop- er activity by a judicious training. f.            CHAPTER V. "Pray, what's the matter, Mr. Swindler!" said the banker's lady, after having some time closely observed her husband, who sat wincing and twitching in a man- ner that indicated an uneasy state of mind; and which Mrs. Swindler, not without reason, conjectured was produced by the contents of a letter he had just pe- rused, and still held uneasily in his hand.. "Nothing, nothing ;" replied the husband, hemming and making an effort to put on an air of indifference. "Can't deceive me Mr. Swindler, that uneasiness you manifest is not all for nothing," insisted his lady. "Very observant, madam," he replied in a tone of sarcasm, "but that displeases me not; I like to be noticed, it flatters my vanity." "Make light of it if you will-I know a heavy thought hangs upon your mind. What letter is that P" "It's of no importance." From whom does it come?" "A plague of an old woman who has managed to get into jail." "Well really, that's curious enough. And how does it happen that she writes to you." "Wants me to look after her children. She thinks me marvelous charitable, I imagine." "Yes, yes, I begin to comprehend the affair-it's all 171    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5840-00000089"/> 172     THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE. clear enough!" said the good lady, much excited, and her eyes flashing fire. "I'll venture," contined she, tartly; and with increasing agitation, " the woman has some right to ask you to look after her children-she perhaps knows who they belong to." "' Not getting jealous I hope, my dear?" "' What business has such a woman writing to you, I'd like to know ." "To set your mind at rest on that subject, Mrs. Swindler, you shall have the satisfaction of reading the letter ;" remarked the husband coolly, at the same time offering it to her. "I've no wish sir, none in the least," she quickly replied, spurning the missive, "to peruse your love iotes-especially when they come from jail birds." "Now madam, permit me then to tell you, this let-. ter is from the widow Neal, that washer-woman who made so much ado about the trifling sum she deposited in bank. --Remember you not that haggard looking creature that used to come every week to dun me, and whom at last I had to kick out of doors to get rid of?" "Very well I remember-and thought you a mons- ter of cruelty for spurning her so. It Would have look- ed much better to have returned the little money you owed her, and wh'ch by hardest toil she had earned." Now taking the note from her husband's hand, she proceeded to read it, and was evidently deeply moved  by its contents. "You must acknowledge madam," said Swindler, , a -  .   -.Lai .vY:iIEEL oF IORTUNE=. 17 with an air of triumph, "that your evil surmise wa without foundation, and that I am innocent." "Innocent!" retorted the wife indignantly; " th man who robs a poor widow, and brings to want he: helpless children, can hardly be esteemed innocent I you are innocent of the thing my thoughts accused you of, I find you guilty of a much higher crime." "Bless me, could I help Mrs. Neal's being a thief' "Had you not wronged her out of her scant earn ings, the poor woman might never have been tempted to take what was not her own," Now casting her tearful eyes again upon the-letter, and tracing the touching lines with emotion, she di- rectly exclaimed:  Alas, unhappy woman! her chil- dren were crying for bread, whilst she had no means of satisfying their hunger. Hear what she says, Mr. Swindler. 'To feed my perishing babes, I yielded to temptation, and took without liberty that which saved them from starvation. Detected in the crime, I'm cast into prison, and no more permitted to look after my helpless ones. I left them in a little hovel on Bank alley: for God's sake forget it not-send -them food, that they perish not with hunger.' With much feeling she read the last paragraph, then turning to her hnis- band, said ; "Have you a heart, and can you hesitate? Go at once, I entreat you, and give her at least the amount you owe her, that the unfortunate woman may be able to send relief to her dear, suffering children." "You are very inconsiderate, Mrs. Swindler, do you K    <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5840-00000090"/> 174     THE u WIM  OF Foit'rUNE. not-plainly -ee that to pay our -debts, would be to im , poveris-'h us?"

"Reserve your dark prediction, my angel, for the superstitious, on me they aro lost. I fear no iude- ments-e---ither in, this world or the next." On the following morning Mrs. Swindler, on look- ing, into the daily paper, saw it announced that the widow Neal, had died in prison. After hastily read- ing the accounti she dropped the paper, exclaiming: Oh) -dear, died in jail! died a ravinggmaniac! The poor woman has gone to her account. 0- God! hap- less creature! hapless mother! Will not thia touch the bankers'heart? a many heart it would." While she yet discoursed to herself in this'pathetic strain, her husband came, in; she immediately handed him the paper, and- without saying a word,- pointed to the paragraph she desired bi'm to, read. He glanced at the article a moment, then contemptuously cast the paper aside, re-marking as he! did so: "I've no taste -for reading about funerals, nor am I inclined to put bn iaourning for the death of a pauper." "No one has more reason to mourn for that poor   1LHE W HEEL OF rJORTUNE-    17P creature's death than ourself, Mr. Swindler.

It was at the dead of night; the banker and his lady locked in their chamber, slept--but he not soundly: disturbed by dismal dreams, he moaned, gnashed his teeth, and now and then muttered dreadful impreca- tions. At length he awoke-'woke suddenly, and start- ing from his pillow, convulsed with fright, cried out: "Oh! oh! what on earth is that?" His wife, roused from her slumbers, demanded the cause of his disturbance. "See! see!" he cried, with increasing terror. "What? what? you're dreaming. Why start you so '" "See, that old woman has come out of her grave!" "I behold nothing, and am sure you do not," insist- ed the lady. "Why, there, right there she stands; 'tis the widow Neal, who died last night in jail. Drive her away, be- fore I loose my senses." "Fie! fie! my husband; you see but the shadow of your own fears. Be composed; you're all of a tremor and cold perspiration seems breaking from every pore.' "No wonder, only see what a look she puts on; it freezes my blood!" The wife now striking a light, the spectre vanished. "'Tis gone, thank heaven!" he exclaimed; " 'twas 176   THE WHEEL OF ]FORTUNE      1T7 very strange!" he added, wildly gazing round the room, while large drops of perspiration stood upon his pale brow. "Ah, you saw but with the eyes of a guilty consci- ence," remarked his lady. "Say no more, I'll try again to sleep," said he, throw- ing himself back upon his pillow. The light was ex- tinguished, and all was quiet again. But scarce an hour had passed, when the banker a second time startled his wife by springing up in the bed and uttering a cry of terror. "In the name of wonder what ails you Mr. Swind- ler?" she said, at the same time shaking him violently as if to scare away a spell of the nightmare. "The ghost! the ghost," he shrieked, clinging to his wife for protection. "Nonsense!" she said, impatiently; "coward, there's no such thing." "Have you eyes, and cannot see the aparition? Why, there it stands. Hark, it speaks." "Do you hear a voice?" '"Yes, do not you?" "No, not a sound, but that we ourselves make," "It cried, 'my children! my children! Oh God my poor children!' Now 'tis gone. A fearful thing to be thus disturbed in one's sleep." "Ah, sir, a fearful thing it is to be disturbed by the voice of an accusing conscience. Already fulfilled is my prediction-a strange judgment has overtaken you."    <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5840-00000092"/> 178     THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE. A servant girl, who lodged in an adjoining chamber, hearing the alarm, came in to inquire the cause. "Kate, Kate," said Swindler, "something must be done for the widow Neal's orphan children. Though late the hour, it must be done to-night. Do you hear?" "Well sir," replied the girl, half inclined to think the man had gone mad. "A raving ghost has been here, and prates about their starvation. Take them something to eat. Go at once." "I'll go sir," answered the servant, and turned about to make preparation. "Take not our fine flour," said Swindler, "in the pantry you'll find a little sack of shorts; that take to the hungry brats; I dare say their appetites are keen enough for brand."- "That will not be sufficient Mr. Swindler," said his wife, "it is a very small amount." "Bountiful! a half-peck of shorts is bountiful." In- sisted the hushand. Obediently Kate took the sack of shorts, and off she went through the darkness of the night to feed the motherless children. The banker, now laid himself down again to slum- ber, feeling a sense of duty done, and hoping for the remainder of the night to rest undisturbed. But e're he had composed his mind to sleep, the aparition re- turned.   "HE -W HEEL OF J'ORTUNE.     179 '"Ah, here it is again," he shuddering, cried, "and will not be appeased." "Speak to it," said his lady. "Hark, 'tis itself about to speak." And with uplift- ed hands, open mouth, and staring eyes, the terrified mortal gazed, upon what to his companion, seemed vacancy. "Heard you anything 2" questioned the wife. "Ah, the ghost derides me for the scant provision I sent the orphans." "No marvel. But what does it say!" "Mockingly it says: 'Shorts, shorts, shorts! a half peck of shorts!" "Yes, yes, thine own conscience it is that thus taunts thee." "Vanished from my sight once more, thanks to the powers above.

But Tom sat upon his blanket, keeping a sharp look-out for the ghost. Directly a light foot-fall was heard upon the 'stair- way ;instantly Tom sprang to his feet,-a moment paused to listen; confirmed in his apprehensions, and frightened till his kinky hair almost stood straight on end, he leaped upon the banker's bed, suddenly wak- ing and terribly frightening him. "De ghost! de ghost?" cried the darky; "de ghost coming' down stairs!" "Hark!" whispered the banker, quaking in every joint. Soft footsteps were now distinctly heard, tap, tap, tap. "Oh mercy on us!" ejaculated Tom. "Lorry, golly, gosh, pity take pon my poor tarnal soul!" "Pray for me Tom, I've no knack of it ;" said the dismayed wretch, shaking like jelly. "See," he stam.

All his apprehensions now removed, Tom with an air of bravery, blew out the light, and threw himself down on his blanket. "You villain!" cried Swindler, angrily, "why did you extinguish the lamp!" "So dat you mont sleep while I keeps off de ghosts." "Let us then have no more false alarms." Quiet again prevailed; but before balmy sleep had sealed the eyelids of the unhappy banker, a fresh cause of alarm sprung up. "What's that?" said Swindler, "I hear something else coming down stairs." "Nudder ghost, I reckons ;" replied Tom derisive- ly; now confident that nothing but cats could come down the stairway. "Walks devilish heavy for a cat, Tom." "'Tis a tom-cat, may be." "Hush, hark! 'Tis 'tis. Light that lamp, quick as lightning I tell you." "Nebber fur, dis nigger 'grees to take any ghost by de collar what comes here to night." At this moment the stair door suddenly swung wide open; aud a tall, hideous figure, with a frightful head of horns; with ashy face, and glaring eye balls, and from whose mouth issued a blue dismal flame, appear    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5840-00000095"/> 184     THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE. ed on the threshhold. For an instant, the demon as it seemed, stood perfectly still, without the sign of mo- tion, or the moving of a muscle. Swindler and his darky were petrified, and appeared for a space, neither to move nor breathe. Now, suddenly the monster shook its terrific head, and rattled its horns. This broke the spell, and brought the frightened mortals to their prayers. The banker in the phrensy of excite- ment, and with dreadful perturbation of mind, cried: "O pray good devil, show mercy, and spare me this once I But oh, most precious and most excellent devil, if vengance you must have, O pray take this wicked nigger." 'No, no, massa devil," cried Tom, I's but a poor, hornry colored individual, not worth hell-room; but dis ar a rich gentman, what you's a right to, as every body says." Again the frightful object shook its head, and rat- tled its horns; then bounding towards the terrified banker, pitched and raved at a furious rate, till the frighted mortal could endure no more, and swooning, fell senseless upon his pillow. Feeling sufficiently revenged, Kate now darted back up the stairway, and doffing her horns and dough-face, made her exit from the house, without being discovered.   CHAPTER VI. Passing over an unimportant period in the history of the ghost haunted banker, we find him in the course of a few years, again left a widower. Soon after the death of his wife, connected with which event there was something of mystery, dark suspicions were whispered, and surmises of foul play, in the sud- den demise. Be that as it may, his career in crime constantly accellerated, and every day he seemed to be- yI   come more profligate, infamous and abandoned. This is perhaps true of all evil-doers, who impose no restraint upon their vile passions, and wicked inclina- tions. Remorse may rankle in the breast, and like a fiery serpent perpetually sting the guilty soul, and coil and hiss, within the sin-polluted bosom, yet rarely does reformation take place in the life of a man who becomes so reprobate that he no longer' seeks to cultivate and cherish the better feelings and nobler sentiments of the heart. Now unencumbered by the domestic relations and matrimonial ties, which had hitherto imposed some re- straint upon his conduct, Swindler at once put on the airs of a gallant, and sought to victimize every poor and unprotected female that chanced to strike his fancy. To carry out his base designs, and gratify his licen- tious inclinations, he not only taxed his wits and em- 16             (185)    <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5840-00000096"/> 186     THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE. ployed every artifice that low cunning is capable of, but also freely used his money. About this time, the death of Mrs. Foxglove occur- red; and Juliet was left to struggle with poverty and adversity unaided and alone. Tifs infamous plotter against female innocence and virtue, chanced to turn his salacious eyes upon the fair Juliet, whose forlorn condition and destitute circum- stances had by accident come to his knowledge; staight- way he conceived the dark design of compassing her ruin. The unhappy girl feeling the need of a sympathising friend, and being by nature trusting, open-hearted, and unsuspecting, she was. poorly shielded against an in- sidious attack from one coming in the guise of fiiend- ship. Swindler, having enlisted a polished villain to as- sist him in accomplishing his nefarious designs, and one who had long been a hired accomplice in his ser- vice, he was the better prepared to ensnare the unwary and deceive the simple-hearted. One day in conversation with this unscrupulous man, his associate in crime, he thus addressed him: "What say you Gowen? I'm desperately in love." "For the thousandth time, I imagine;" responded his friend. 'I must needs love often," remarked the banker, sincee my amours are short-lived. Know you Juliet Foxglove, the broker's daughter?" "Ay, why shouldn't I."   THE WnHEE oF FORTUNE.     18T "What think you of her?" "More tempting is she than the apple of Eden,. which caused our-fall." "Will gold and flattery win her?" "Doubtful; yet gold, with us poor mortals, almost iJ! anything will do-quite make a christian ofa Jew." "Her mother having lately deceased, the girl is now left I'm told, altogether destitute and friendless; so its likely she'd gladly embrace an opportunity of getting :  a comfortable home."    "That may be; and should you desire it, I'll take pleasure in mentioning the subject to her." I?   "Just what I was about to propose. You antici- pate my wishes. How long have you known her?" "I only know her history, and have several times seen her face. She knows not me, be it said to her credit, nor shall she; yet when I have talked with her she may think she does." "I doubt it not." "But she's high metal, and must be cautiously ap- proached." "When a pretty girl is poor, I take it her fall is sure." "Not always. Be not too sanguine; I fear we'll find the fair Juliet too strongly intreuohed in virtue. If we succeed, it will be through some deep laid scheme of deception. With her, a shallow plot, be assured, will not work." "Money and a promise to marry, may be necessary, nothing more, I predict."

"Employ her to do some kind of sewing for you; solicit her to come to your house while she does it; if she consents, give her a finely furnished room, and make her comfortable; and be sure you do not make love too fast.- Let her think you in earnest, then she will at least respect you; and doubt not your wealth will tempt her. If she at last consents to marry you get up a sham wedding, show her a spurious license, which I can readily write for you; let Ben Stikes into the secret, teach him the marriage ceremony, dress him in clerical style, and fear not but that he'll play the parson admirably." "But in such a game there might be danger." "If s8e suspect no fraud, you need have no appre- hensions." "But should I at any time wish to get rid of her to make room for another, what then? She would like- ly get me into trouble by proving the fraud." "Hav'nt you friends to swear for you? and how easy a matter is it to discredit and blast the reputation of a moneyless, homeless, unprotected girl." "Well then, Gowen, go sound the sea of her mind; if you find it fair sailing, report accordingly, and I'll reward your pains." "' will go and seek her out at once; if yet without any permanent employment, you may expect me to bring her immediately to your house,"   THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.      189 &amp;"I trust you may. Then I'll promise myself a rare treat, and a rich time of love-making." Gowen was a man whose address, manners, and conversation, were scarcely less pleasing, than his prin- ciples were corrupt, licentious, and abandoned. Know ing well how to insinuate himself into favor with the unsophisticated, he was altogether a dangerous man for Juliet to meet with; especially at a time when her heart was crushed by misfortune, and overshadowed with the darkness of despair. Gowen found her at a time when she was in the most straightened circumstances, and anxiously seek- ing employment. Putting on all the blandishments he was capable of, the sycophant approached her as one actuated by the purest principles of benevolence; professed sympathy, in a tone of sincerity; lamented her forlorn condition: informed her of the opportunity that now opened to her for a pleasant and permanent a  -situation, and proposed accompanying her to the resi- f   dence of the wealthy Mr. Swindler. - SlSuspecting nothing wrong, Juliet unhesitatingly ac- cepted the proposition; and going with the stranger 1i  to the place recommended, was introduced to Swin- dler. The affair was speedily arranged--Juliet was employed as a seamstress; and consented to remain at the banker's house. S      ,    <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5840-00000098"/> CHAPTER VIII. "Now do tell," said Bettie Blossom, "has Juliet Foxglove come to that of a sewing girl? Well, well, such a coming down!" "High blown pride is sure to get a fall;" remarked Molly Nettles, affecting something like gravity of tone and manner. "'Tis said the old ghost haunted banker's making love to Jule." "Mercy on us! and his wife hardly cold in her grave!" "That's nothing for a widower; to marry they're ever in haste-as much too fast as bachelors are too slow. A widower at first sight proposes; but these bachelors-I could wring their noses!" "Its funny when they do get roped in;" said the other, "the way Polly Rickets did was a sin." "Pray what did she?" "You heard of her marriage, I suppose A" "Why no; whom did she wed?" "Jimmy Rinkle they say-if the wind don't blow him away." "Lame! when?" "Last evening ; and gave him such a fright, he slept not a wink the live-long night!" "Good enough for him! 'Twould be my delight to give some old batch a similar fright." "No doubt it would; I'd prefer a braver man." 190   CHAPTER IX. Swindler, lost little time in essaying to make love to his intended victim; disguising his worst- traits, he studiously sought, in her presence, to appear amiable. His inate coarseness, however, in spite of all his efforts to dissemble, was not all the while unapparent to Ju- liet, who at first received his advances with little favor; but subsequently upon considering her friendless and In destitute condition, was tempted to sacrifice herself, and for the sake of affluence, as she supposed, consent to a union so revolting to her feelings. Swindler, wearied by being kept long in suspense, while his attentions received so little encouragement from Juliet, was several times on the point of turning her out of doors. At length by specious promises, and the assurance that she should be the queen and. mistress of his mansion, and have his thousands at her command, he obtained her consent to marry him. At the same time there was no intention on his part to wed her legally, but in sham ; and thus to mislead and deceive her for his own selfish and base purposes. # *  *  #  *  +  *  It may be as well perhaps, in this place, again to introduce Stanley Woodberry. During the period which had elapsed since our last account of him, he experienced many turns in the wheel of fortune, and passed through a variety of vicissitudes prosperous and adverse. For nearly three years he 191    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5840-00000099"/> 192     THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE, had lost sight of Juliet, and knew not whether she had married, or still remained single. At the time we now speak of, he was residing in a small village, some distance from the city, devoting himself to literary pursuits, Not a little surprised was he, upon receiving one day a letter from a citizen of Cincinnati, whose name was Vandike, and who at the time the said letter was addressed to Stanley, was lying at the point of death, and expected that every day would be his last. Con- science smitten, in view of eternity, he came to the de- termination, that as far as in his power lay, he would make amends for the great wrongs of his wicked life. He had learned the extent of young Woodberry's loss through the dishonesty of Swindler, who at the time of his failure, made over with fraudulent intent, all his valuable property to him, (Vandike) who still held it, and with power to make any disposition of it he chose. The dying man, fully confessed himself the hired ac- coiplice of the villainous banker; and expressed the wish to see, before his death, Stanley's loss restored to him. That this might be effected, Woodberry was urged to come immediately to the city. He complied with the dying man's request, and making haste, reached Vandike's residence, the day before hisdeath. A legal transfer of all the property he thus held for Swindler, was made over to Stanley, including the splendid man- sion in which Swindler then lived, and the principle part of the costly furniture it contained.   THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.      193 Stanley was now made-acquainted with Juliet's sit- uation, and learned from Vandike, who was entrusted with all Swindler's secrets, as well as with his property, that the unfortunate girl was to be deceived and sham- ly wedded to the villain; and that the farce was to be enacted that very night, which was the evening of the same day on which the property passed into Stanley Woodberry's hands. Stanley yet felt sufficient regard for Juliet to inter- fere in her behalf, and to see that she was not thus sS blindly led to ruin. Proceeding at once-to Swindler's al mansion, though not now Swindler's, but his own, he was just in time to witness a consummation of the vil- lain's plot. A small company of well dressed black-legs were convened to witness the farsical transaction. When Stanley approached the outer door, he was mistaken by the servant stationed there, for one of the invited guests, and ushered into the spacious parlor Without ceremony, and just at the moment when Juliet and Swindler was asked by the counterfeit parson to pres- ent themselves on the floor to be joined in the holy bonds of wedlock. At this solemn mockery, the guests exchanged sly glances, and seemed to make an effort to keep down their risibilities. Swindler took his victim by the hand, to lead her out upon the floor; the girl hesitated, and her sorrowful looks plainly told that she felt the terrible truth, that she was about to be sacrificed. Her deceiver, finding 17    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5840-00000100"/> 194     TmE WHEEL OF FORTUNE it-necessary to use physical force took her by the arm, and raised her to her feet. The ceremony commenced, but in such a bungling manner, as caused the suspi- cion to flash upon Juliet's mind that it was all mock- ery, and but a fraud to compass her ruin.  "I will not, I will not!" she cried; and pulling away, dashed off to the opposite side of the chamber.  "You're mad, foolish girl, you're mad!" exclaimed Swindler, "are you not to be the queen of this man- sion, and have at your command, all I possess Can you be so weak as to spurn the offer, and prefer the life of a-homeless beggar? You shall not act so in- sane a part!" Saying which, he again seized her by the arm, and attempted to drag her out upon the floor. "Away, false man, away!" she cried, with indig- nant look, and flashing-eyes.  "Think not," he replied, "to trifle with me thus." Stanley could wait no longer; rushing forward, he  took the villain by the throat, and with tremendous force hurled him headlong to the floor. The spectators were astounded; but none attempted to interfere. Swindler, recovering form his prostrate attitude, turned to confront his assailant; but soon as he had fully fastened his eyes on Stanley, he recog- nized him, and quailed beneath his fierce and wither- ing glance. "Robber, deceiver, and villain, well may you now turn pale and tremble;" said Stanley, "my hour of  triumph has come at last.   THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.     195 "Not only am 1 able to thwart you in this infernal plot against innocence and virtue, but I shall have the pleasure of teaching you a salutary lesson of humility. Ay, look now yourself to be turned out of doors, and to become the homeless beggar you have threatened to make her whose destruction you've sought." "Your repentant accomplice, to whom with fraudu- lent intent you made over your property, hath this day in view of his approaching end, transferred to me this mansion, with the chief portion of household goods and furniture it now contains." Swindler looked aghast; Stanley's words had fallen like thunder-bolts upon his ear. He stood petrified, and seemed for a space, utterly incapable either of speech or motion. The guests were overwhelmed with amazement, and began one by one to disappear. Stanley now turned to Juliet, who pale as marble, stood seemingly transfixed to the spot, and gazing wildly upon him; an instant they hesitated, then rush- ed into each others arms. 'Twas a touching scene; each was deeply moved, and for some moments stood weeping, looked in each others embrace. Swindler, partially recovering from his shock, stag- gered towards the door, muttering a curse upon them both; and making his way out, went and hung himself. Shortly after this event, Juliet Foxglove and Stan- ley Woodberry were married in the mansion where he found her. And at the last accounts were still resi. ding there, happy in each others society, and blessed with a number of interesting responsibilities.    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5840-00000101"/> AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BEN BOAZ.  CHAPTER I. Having just reached, as it were, life's meredian, I pause to turn a retrospective glance along the path-  way I've thus far traveled; and to contemplate for a brief space the diversified scenes through which I've passed-surveying rapidly, the whole course of my checkered and meandering career, from thebeginning, up to the point at which I have now arrived. How mysterious is memory I While thus my mind's  eye turns to the past, I seemed as in a moment, to live over again years that have fled, and to behold trans- piring anew, as it were, the events I've already wit- nessed, and that dot the course which for half a life- time, I've been journeying. While recollection, wafts me along through the lapse of by-gone days, hardly can I persuade myself that the actualities I've been cognizant of, are in very deed reality. Their history seems more like a strange, wild dream; or a romance, full of marvelous exploits, won-  derful accidents, startling events, singular and curious 196    AUTOBIOGcRAPHY O BNr BoZ. 19 incidents. The oft repeated remark that, "factisstran. ger than fiction," is not without foundation in truth. A picturesque spot, in a rural district of WestIndi- ana, was the home of my childhood, and theplace of my nativity. Lying upon the east, north, and South, were boundless forests; upon the west, delightful plains, beautiful undulating prairie, decorated with every vari- ety of wild flower, and blossoms of every hue. To the south, in view of the humble domicile, in which I was born, a majestic hill, or rather, mountain, crowned with mighty oaks, the black walnut, and the-tall poplar, lifted its summit to the skies, as if ambitious to kiss the morning's earliest rays, and to be tipped with gold at eventide by the sun's last lingering beams. Be- yond that, and for many miles in extent, were-huge ridges, deep ravines, and rocky cliffs, darkened by the thick foliage of tall trees whose branches interlocked and seemed matted together, as if on purpose to shut out from earth, the geniel light of heaven. With what awe, and with what a deep, pervading sense of the sublime, I oft in the days of my boyhood, wandered through those deeply shaded wilds, gazing upon the solemn grandeur of hill and dale, and mountain glen. And how oft, in the night time, I've listened to the howl of the wolf, and the scream of the panther echo- ing there, while with childish fear I shrank into the chimney corner, or trembling, clung to my mother's knee.

His first appearance in the neighborhood, was about the time the school-house was erected. Upon his mak- ing application for employment as teacher, a commit- tee was chosen tolook into his capabilities. At a given time, the Rabbies met, and gravely proceeded to dis- charge the duties imposed upon them as a committee of examintion. They first produced a spelling book, requesting the applicant to spell the lesson commen- cing with the word baker; the performance was sat- isfactory; they next required him to read a chapter in the Bible, in this also he gave satisfaction; and the stranger was pronounced a competent teacher. The cream of the joke was, that only one out of the three that composed the committee, could either read or spell. In fact there were not four men in the neighborhood, at that period, who knew "B. from bull's foot."  After the school had been in progress some time, it was discovered that the teacher had occasionally a pe- culiar strangeness of manner, bordering as it was thought, on insanity. This misfortune was directly attributed to his great learning; he had been too highly educated; his skull had been; crammed so fill of knowledge, the poor fel- low's brain hadn't room to contain it. Immense sym- pathy was felt throughout the community for the luck- less school-master, whose mind had been so overbur- dened with learning ; and some parents seriously talked of taking their children from school, for fear their heads   AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BEN BOAZ.     201: might also be turned. It soon was discovered how- ever, that the pedagogue's strangeness was less owing to his education, than to a certain other cause, a too free use of intoxicating drinks. To guard against the evils growing out of this unfortunate habit, the trustees of the school, in contracting with the teacher for a second term, bound him in an article of agreement, not to get drunk in school hours. In early youth I became somehow impressed that I should one day be a minister. This impression led me to a more diligent study of the scriptures, and of pulpit oratory. To test my oratorical powers, I often went alone into the woods, and mounting on a log or stump, would take my text, and discourse to the trees. Careful to follow the example set me by ministers of experience, I waxed warmer and warmer, louder and louder, from the commencement to the end of my ser- mon. While I 'waked the echos, my forest congrega- tion paid due respect; and though not the severest, critics, were perhaps as competent judges of sermoniz- ing, as many other audiences that I've since addressed. In the seventeenth year of my age, I was sent to Wabash College, to complete my education; impa- tient however, to enter the ministry, which my mind was now bent on, I unwisely cut my time short at that institution, and connected myself with the Indiana. Conference, of the Methodist Episcopal church. My first year in the ministry was at Brookville.    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5840-00000104"/> 202    &amp;UTOBIOGRAPHY oOF. BF,. BO82i. It is now myhonest conviction, that my appointment tos, important afield of labor, was, decidedly inj'udi- cious on the part of the appointingpower of the church. I wwas tho young a man, had too little ex 'perience, knew too little Df the world, and of ministerial duties to meet the responsibilities and properly discharge the arduous duties which -there devolved upon me. Whatever gifts, a young man may possess, he wants experienie, to be a profitable "preacher, especially to an intelligent com- munity., And Brookville, at that time, was consid- ered. one of the mIlost refined and intelligent places in the state. I weRl remember the crushing weight that hung -upon my heart, and seemed to ptrylize all the powers of my mind, the first time I entered the pulpit at Brookville ; the house was crowded to overflowing by a gay and fashionable assembly; men too of expe- rience, of enlarged minds, and more than ordinary eru- dition, sat -before Me; what an absurdity, methought to -myself, that at mere boy as I was, should rise up t offer, instruction to the mature, the learned, and the gray haired whom years, had made wise. But the church had so decreed, and I dared not disobey. After read- inggmy text, I scarce knew what I uttered from the be- ginning to the end, of my, discourse; I occasionally grew blind, and seemed to loose my breath ; so op- pressed was, I with the consciousness of my incapacity    to do the subject justice, and satisfy flie intelligent por- tion of my audience. So greatly was I mortified on account of my crip- pled effort, that my mind was made up befre deseend-   ;   'AuTOBGIOGIRAPnY 'oF B= BoAZ'.   203 in'g fto&amp;' -the pulpit to abandon my 6allibg, till year$ and study bad better matured my faculties. But to my great relief, a weak minded Qld man directly grasp-* ed my hand, and began Iavishimg -the most extravagant praise upon my discourse. I thought him- sadly want- ing in "udgment, if he were sincere; yet, hiis encomiu-nd had the effect to raise my head a little, so that I breath- ed easier. -Shortly after, as I made my wayi through the crowd, I overheard a be'y of silly girls compliment- ing the sermon; I was unwilling to acknowledge to Myself that I set any value Upon eulogies from such a source; yet in s, ite of my better judgment, their'prai- ses made me feel decidedly more comfortable. By bard study -and close application, I was enabkd to sustain- myself through my firs conference year-bet'- ter than I at fikst anticipatted. Towatrds the latter part of the year, I deemed it expedient to write my sermons and read them from the pulpit, instead of extempori- zing as I had been acculstolncd to do. This, on the part of the leading members,of the church, was Objeocp tionable; notwithstanding my written sermoDS were better, they preferred extemporaneous discourse., For tho sake of my own improvement however, I persis- ted in writing. At the next annual Conference, I wim not a little surprised to,'Jnd a charge preferred against me for Breaching from manuscript. I was defended, However, by the most intelligent members of the Con- ference, and the charge was withdrawn. I liave not designed, by, any means, to give in this autobiography, any thing like a ffill or extended ac-    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5840-00000105"/> 20    AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BEN BOAZ. count of my ministerial career. The first three years, I got along for the most part, smoothly. My time was much taken up in reading and study; this habit made me appear unsociable, and to some extent ren- dered me unpopular with the people. The chief draw- back upon my proficiency in the study of theology, was my exceeding susceptibility to the tender passion. A pretty face, and the light of a soft, sweet eye in wo- man, sometimes triumphed over my attachment to books, and made sad havoc of my studies. The man or the minister who can look unmoved upon a noble female figure, or resist the charm that lurks in a glo- rious eye in woman, has either more grace or more philosophy than has ever fallen to my lot. Had any one predicted in my early youth, that I should live to see life's meredian in a state of celibacy, and still a bache- lor, I'd thought him no prophet. But it has so hap- pened. Were I asked the reason why? I should find the answer difficult. It is not that I preferred celi- bacy; nor that I wanted favorable opportunities to marry. In fact, it would require a volume to render a reason for leading a life so contrary to my nature.   CHAPTER II. In the beginning of my fourth year in the ministry, I was appointed to Franklin, a pretty little town in a central part of the state. After preaching there a month or two, I was removed by the presiding elder of the district, to Indianapolis. Here my trials commenced; and such trials as ended in a down-fall from which I never fully recovered. My first offense was that of ad- vancing certain sentiments not entirely Methodistical. This, not only awakened opposition, but much bitter animosity against me. I justify not myself; nor do I justify those who sought to crush me, because of my new opinions. About the time the difficulty I refer to occurred I fell into a singular nervous affection, and experienced mental sensations, which I've never yet been able sa- tisfactorily to account for, nor rationally explain. The first symptom I felt of it, was on a summer evening; I sat alone in my studio, the deepening twilight added gloom to the solemnity of my thoughts. Languidly reclining upon the casement of the window by which I sat, my gaze was directly fixed upon the bright even- ing star; Venus methought, never before looked -o ra- diant, so sweet and lovely. While I mused, still in- tently looking at the brilliant star, whose soft silvery light seemed to penetrate mine inmost soul, suddenly 205    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5840-00000106"/> 206   AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BEN BOAZ. a strange, wild sensation came over me; it was unac- countable,-I felt alarmed, and rising quickly to my feet, hastened out into the open air, and walked briskly till I reached a maple grove adjacent to the suburbs of the city. The sensation was not very unlike that which we experience immediately after taking ether or chlori- form. It was not an unhappy feeling, but rather one of ecstasy, almost rapture; a kind of transport. My soul seemed to expand, filling boundless space, grasp- ing immensity, and compassing the very out-posts of creation.- I imagined it something that would directly pass off; in that however, I was mistaken ; the excite- ment increased, my thoughts constantly grew wilder,. and my feelings more extatic. I passed the whole night alone in the grove, wandering to and fro, and occasion- ally iUttering impromptu poetry. When the day dawn- ed, my mental excitement somewhat abated, and my strange feelings partially passed away. And now I began to feel oppressed, found it difficult to breathe; a deep and dismal gloom gathered upon the sky of my mind, and I grew exceedingly unhappy. In the mean- time, singular theories came up before me, and won- derful visions full of fantastical imaginings, floated through my feverish brain. When night came on again  my wildness and strangeness of feeling returned; and  thus I long continued to be alternately elated and de-  pressed. A roving spirit at length came upon me;  I advised with no one, but made up my mind to travel abroad. Leaving Indianapolis, I went south, making an extensive tour through Tennessee, Alabama, and   AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BEN BOAZ.     07 Lousiana; preaching and lecturing in every town, vil- lage, and city, through which I passed. Sometimes I was Orthodox, sometimes Hetrodox. Traveling but tended to aggravate the unhealthy ex- citement of mind under which I labored. The opposi- tion with which I frequently met, and the heated con- troversies into which I was often drawn by ministers who were as silly as I was wild, had a very injurious effect upon me. I but do justice to myself in saying, that it was in this peculiar state of mind, that I made all my theolo- gical mutations, and turned the curious sommersets about which so much was said a few years ago in cer- tain newspapers. Not being rightly understood, the press, as well as individuals, did me great injustice About the time I grew weary of roaming, I received a call to preach for a congregation at Louisville, Ken- tucky; I accepted, and there located myself for one year. A restless spirit again seized me; directly I was upon the wing, lecturing and preaching as before. I at length turned my attention to the teaching of Elo. cution; in this, for a time, I succeeded well. I taught several classes, in a Baptist College, at Franklin, In- diana. Subsequent to that, I visited Ashbury Univer- sity, at Greencastle, Indiana, where owing to my here- sy in religion, I met with no little opposition in at- tempting to get up a class. But three young men, out of the great number of students in the Institution, con- sented to take lessons of me. After a few weeks, how- ever, I managed to make friends among the students,    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5840-00000107"/> 208   AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BEN BOAZ. and succeeded-in obtaining a class of fifty. Before getting through with my course of lectures by too great exertion, I took cold upon my lungs, and for near two months was confined to my room, and thought several times at the point of death. Finding the vocal effort, necessary in teaching Elo- cution, too great for my attenuated and feeble frame, I abandoned it. I next went to Iowa; and after visiting all the prin- cipal towns in the territory, as it was then, I located at Iowa City, a beautiful town, and surrounded by a glorious country. I found the people intelligent and enterprising. And had I been in health, and in a calm, quiet state of mind, I could have made myself content and happy. I formed a congregation to which I preached several months. I never was more attached to any commu- nity; but a spirit of change, and of rambling haunted me; I went to other parts; again traveled south; and after about two years returned to my native State, and, fortunately improved in health of body and mind. Having by an unhappy eccentricity ruined my pros- pects for usefulness in the ministry, I now turned my attention to the study of law, and was in a few months admitted to the bar.  Not long after taking up the legal profession, by some freak, it came into my head to write a book. At once giving up the practice of the law, and resolved on becoming an author, I took up my pen and went to work. In the course of a year, I produced a book of   AUTOBIOGRAPHY Or BE3 BoAZ.    209 three hundred pages. The task proved more difficult, and the labor more arduous than I anticipated. The work was published in Cincinnati, and had a sale of some eighty thousand copies. How it happened that I made nothing by my labor of writing the book, is perhaps best known to certain publishers, who reject the maxim, that "honesty is the bestpolicy. After the work had had a wide sale, I was induced to dramatise it. My friends being sanguine that the play would have an immense run; I was further in- duced to rent a large hall in the city, employ a com- pany, and have the piece produced under my own su- pervision and management. Knowing nothing about theatricals, and wholly unacquainted with professional players, I was rather poorly prepared for going into such a difficult and extremely hazardous enterprise. I, however, went a-head undaunted, and quite san- guine of success. Such another set as composed my company of play- ers, perhaps the Lord never made, if indeed he made them at all. I must however say, thereweretwo Ger- man ladies in the company, of decided talent; and had the play been German, they would have shone bri- liantly. At our first rehearsal, one of my actors was so drunk he fell sprawling upon the floor, in attempt- ing to go through his part.  Some days previous to the time fixed upon for pro- ducing the piece, I received a letter from an actor at New York, whom I had engaged to play the leading part, stating that he would not be able to fill his en- 18    <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5840-00000108"/> 210    AuTOBIQoGAPUY o0 BES BoaZ. gagement. This discouraged me, and I was upon the, point of giving up the enterprise; but having already incurred considerable expense, for wardrobe, scenery, &amp;c., I finally determined to go forward, "sink or swim survive or perish." But I could see no other alterna- tive, than to take the leading part myself-and which I did, under a fictitious name. On the first night of our opening, the audience was much larger than I had anticipated; and composed of a highly intelligent class of people. I never reme- ber to have felt the same degree of anxiety,on any oc-  casion as I did that night. I wasn't sure in the begin- ning, that all of the players were sober; besides, I knew, whether drunk or sober, many of them would butcher their parts. With trembling sensations run- ning through my nerves, and an oppressive misgiving about the heart, I ordered the curtain to be raised it weznt up, the play commenced, and such a comnlence- mernt! Passions were torn to "tatters, to very rags!" I xas tortured, but in silence had to endure it. My prompter, though a fine scholar, found his task  a difficult one, and having never before served in such a capacity, he unavoidably made sundry mistakes. One of his blunders led to the following ludicrous scene : A corpulent lady, who had a daughter figuring in the performance, and whom she was ambitious to see dis- tinguish herself, stood behind the scenes, watching her daughter go through the part, with great solicitude-; the prompter slightly misled the youg lady, by giving her the wrong word, which oqsca sioed a trifling blun- d W4 ph Qe,   AUTcOBIOABiAP  OF- B N-BOA,.  2s der; the excited mother directly rushed out upon the stage, just as the curtain began to come down, with fiery flashing eyes, and hands; upraised; gasping for breath a moment, then putting on grim terrific looks, she exclaimed: ;The damned fellow prompted her wrong!" Fortunately, the curtain descended in time to pre- vent the audience from witnessing what was not- set down in the bills. As soon as the prompter recovered from the fright with which the lady's terrific looks and gestures had filled him, he went into convulsions of laughter; and such a general roar took place behind the curtain, as must have caused the audience to feel they were not getting their share of the fun. The play throughout, worked rather stifly; the scenes were badly arranged, and some of the dialogues en- tirely too long. Most of the players were badly up in their parts; their acting was unnatural, and their elo- cution worse than miserable. The German ladies and myself, by a few happy hits, in the last act' brought down the house with applause, and to some extent re- deemed the play. On the second night, the hall was densely crowded at an early hour. Unfortunately, a few hours before, I had been taken suddenly ill, from an attack of pleu- risy, and not only was unable to go to the hall, but so violent was the attack, I could give no advice as to the management of the affair. Some of the actors, upon seeing a full house, insisted that the play should go on at all hazards, for the sake of saving the money, as    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5840-00000109"/> 212   AUTOBIOcmAPHY or BE BoAz. some six or eight hundred dollars had been taken in; others opposed attempting any performance without my assistance. After a long dispute, it was decided that an apology should be made to the audience, and their money refunded. Several weeks after this, when I had partially re- covered, I authorized another attempt to produce the play; but my means by this time being exhausted, a very lame and decidedly unsuccessful effort was made to get up another furor. This piece was played some five or six nights, but under very great disadvantages, and with more expense than profit.   CHAPTER I. Notwithstanding, every turn in the wheel of-fortune seemed against me, I resolved to "try, try again ; and resuming my pen, I went patiently to work on another book; in a few months it was ready for the press. This production, in my own judgment, was far superior to my first; yet notwithstanding its greater merit, I was for certain reasons, inclined to think its sale would be more limited. I published two editions of the work; after which the stereotype plates passed into the hands of a publisher at Chicago, who there issued a large edi. tion; but to what extent the book has since been sold I'm unprepared to say. About the time the above mentioned work came out, a grossly libelous article appeared against me in a cer, tain newspaper, not remarkable for, its truth-telling proclivity, which was calculated greatly to injure the sale of the book. To vindicate myself before the public, and refute the vile calumny, I promptly brought suit for libel, against the editors and proprietors of the paper; If a suit for scandal be justifiable under any circum- stances, it certainly is, when an editor, taking advan- tage of his position, maliciously defames an individual in private life. For what chance has a private citizen, to defend his reputation against the foul aspersions 213    <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5840-00000110"/> 214    AwomonAParIFI  or Buq BOAZ. which the conductor of a public paper may wantonly propagate through his prostituted columns?

The judge on the bench, putting on an air of dignity, and speaking in a grave tone, alluded to the great length of time the case had been in Court; dwelt at length upon the immense  trouble it had given, and hinted strongly that the plain-  tiff was but persecuting, and seeking to annoy a class of men, who should be privileged to say and publish what they pleased, and about whom they pleased, to   : the wide world.  Without further delay, I was forced into trial, and that to, with the disadvantage of a packed jury to try the case, whose minds were evidently made up against me, before they were empannelled. The speeches made by defendant's counsel, were ad. mirably adapted to the taste and capacity of the jury-  replete with billingsgate, low vulgar slang, and witless sayings. The verdict was what might have been expected, from men who could be bought at a low price. The public knowing very little about the facts in the case, and seeing unfair and partial reports of the trial, I now stood before the world under a darker cloud than at any previous time. I felt that it was hard, very hard, that unscrupulous men should thus with impu- nity rob me of the little hard earned reputation I en- joyed, and thereby rob me of every earthly comfort; for reputation to me was money-was bread, subsist-   ' ence, life itself. A man in my position, without moral  character could do nothing. 10   AUTOBIOGRAPH OoF BEN BOAZ.    2 Now destitute, reduced to crushing poverty, and al most friendless, I again went to work with my pen; another book is in progress; what the result may be, and what success shall crown my present labors, it is hard to tell. One thing I feel is certain, if I were in easier crcumstances, and happier, I could write better I crave to be understood, to be better known -I crave that the world should read my heart, mine inmost heart, my heart of hearts; then, but not till then, will the public do me justice. 19    <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5840-00000112"/> THE FALLE N ANGEL.  I BY BEN BOAZ. CHAPTER I. The bright vision of a cherubic face haunts me. An- gelina, as she looked when first I saw her, never can I forget; she was then a child, a beautiful child,-too fair, and too angelic, I thought, for earth! Blue as the summer sky, and bright as the twinkling stars of night were her speaking eyes. Her hair was of a gol- den hue, and drooped in sunny ringlets upon a smo6the white forehead, and hung in flowing tresses about her well formed shoulders.  Who that beheld her in the days of her purity and  innocence, could have predicted her fall? As soon should I have looked for a seraph to become a fiend.  Angelina's parents were poor, but highly respected,  :L and always managed to make a genteel appearance.  Angelina was the eldest daughter; and from her in- fancy had been idolized by her parents. Though in  her tender years, a sweet spiit, full of gentleness, kind- ness, and love, she after a wile grew vain, proud and 218   i   THE FALLEN ANGEL.       219 ambitious. Poverty, instead of humbling her spirit, seemed but to chafe, irritate, and embitter. If she went into society at all, none but the first cir- cle or upper-tens would do; nor could she endure that her apparel on any occasion, be inferior to the best. Thus to figure, required more means than the limited circumstances of her parents could well afford; and it often happened that on particular occasions, the de- sired equipage and apparel, could not be furnished; in silence she would suffer the privation, and through pride, remain at home rather than not vie with the rich. In her eighteenth year, a pecuniary misfortune hap- pened to her father, which brought the family into still more indigent circumstances; it was clearly percepti- ble that as Angelina descended into the vale of poverty, and was deprived oflthe means of gratifying her vanity and pride, she grew the more haughty and disdainful In this, she exhibited a peculiar trait of character; for while adversity almost invariably produces humility in other minds, upon Angelina, ithad the opposite effect; she became unamiable, misanthropic, and almost reck- less. At length she married-married unhappily; united herself to a man unsuited to her in every rest pect; spiritless, morose, dogmatical, and overbearing, and withal jealous. The consequence was, a separa- tion directly took place. Angelina now felt that she was not only poor, but that a deep shadow. had come upon her reputation. Soon after parting from her husband, she avowed to     <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5840-00000113"/> 20       THE FALLEN ANGEL. er friends and relatives a determination to enter a onvcnt and spend the remainder of her life in seclu- ion; directly after making this declaration, she dis- ppearea from their midst, leaving all Who knew her ) suppose she had really entered the Cloister. Instead of this however, she had found quarters in an obscure part of the city which had been provided for her by a profligate youth whom she thought wealthy, as he had  but a few years previous to this time, fallen heir to a large inheritance.          .. That Angelina tolerated attentions, and received  favors from this profligate, was the more unpardona- ble inasmuch as she knew him to be a married man; besides, it soon became evident, that on her account, his wife was neglected and abused. It is not in the nature of the human heart to go at nee into the greatest depth of iniquity; Angelina at     ; first experienced terrible qualms of conscience; and  ven, sometimes remonstrated with Rodolph, (which was the name of the recreant husband,) for neglecting his wife; but by degrees her conscience was seared, Ler heart grew obdurate and unfeeling, and a spirit of  recklessness and desperation took possession of her mind. Rodolph, was also too young to be utterly depraved; having yet some heart, and some conscience, he was not prepared to plunge immediately into the blackest crimes men have been known to commit; yet each re- turning day found him a worse man than he was the preceding; for there is a steady growth in iniquity,   as well as in goodness. The man who improves not in virtue, assuredly is going farther in vice; he who is not walking upward in the path of righteousness will certainly be found taking downward steps in crime. Notwithstanding the large patrimony which had come into Rodolph's hands, he was now verging to- wards the end of his means; for by prodigality, intem- perance, and licentiousness, he had in an incredible short space of time, nearly squandered his entire heri- tage; but while it yet held out, Angelina shared a iberal part, and for a time was enabled to live in con- 3iderable splendor.

Having been much in the company Rodolph, for nearly a year, she had learned to stimu-. :e on wine, and occasionally took even stronger ink; and when she again found herself embarrassed means, she at once resorted to the intoxicating cup; and although having too much self respect to get al - utely drunk, she almost constantly kept her brain Ld and her blood in a feverish heat by alcoholic     <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5840-00000114"/> 222      THE FALLEN ANGEL. drinks. On one occasion, after having quaffed a glass of brandy, she said: "Rodolph, I must have money. Do you hear? I must have money!" "But where is it to come from, Angelina?"Replied the bankrupt, putting his hands into his empty pock- ets, and returning the fierce glance of the desperate woman with a vacant stare. 'To come from? no matter where;" returned she with still greater emphasis. "I've given you my last dollar ;" rejoined he in a despairing tone, and with a down-cast look. "Swindle somebody; rob, murder, or do anything, so that you get money." "That might be attended with disagreeable conse- quences;" calmly responded Rodolph, and turning about, left the room. Not many days after this conversation occurred, An- gelina chanced to make the acquaintance of a wealthy widower, who although inclined to be rakish, and given to licentious habits, was nevertheless very illiberal and penurious. Using all her artfulness, she sought to win his affections; not that she liked the man, but in the hope of getting hold of his purse strings. Divulging her scheme to Rodolph, she said cheerily: "My faded prospects brighten again; and my buried hopes rise up out of their grave once more." "I congratulate you Angelina, and hope you may realize your highest expectations ;" returned Rodolph, "but tell me more-how does this happen?"   THE FALLEN ANGEL.      23 "Know you a man, named Hano P" "Yes, a detestable old miser." "Well, is it certain he is rich? "Ay, as a Jew. His estate is immense. "Aha! that is what I like to hear; these hands itch in expectation of grasping his hoarded gold. I'll cap- tivate, wed, and then decapitate him." "Capital! then I'l help you count your gold, as you assisted me to reckon mine." "Doubt not, you'll share my gains." "Let your plans be well laid, and deep." "Ay, deep as the sea." *f  *,  *  *  *  *  *  * Never did a coquette strive harder to achieve a con- quest; but all the captivating airs that the beautiful Angelina was capable of putting on, failed to reach the miser's heart; and had she been chaste as ice, and pure as the mountain snow she might still in vain have sought to hurl her polished shafts at his adamantine bosom-- where no love, except the love of gold, ever dwelt. Yet he visited her oft, and seemed fond of her society; but mere dalliance, with a man whom she despised, Angelina could not long endure. Finding at length, that Hano had no real intention to marry her, she grew impatient, and began to meditate another scheme. Seeking out Rodolph, whose visits had now become less frequent, she said: "Mv mind's made up for more summary measures; I'll no longer dally with lano, he's trifled with me    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5840-00000115"/> 224      THE FALLEN ANGEL. long enough; but I'm not to be baffled in getting his gold." "If he will not marry you, what can you do? I see no other way of getting your hands into, his coffers." 'My plan is this; you can assume his name, and going through the forms of law, be married to me as Hano, and let the marriage be so recorded; that done, I will invite Hano to come to my room on a certain   ! night; you, at the hour appointed, shall be lying in  wait, prepared to dispatch him; soon as his breath is  stopped, his body may be cast into some by-way, where when found, it will not be known who did the murder. Then will I be widow Hano, and entitled to a goodly  share of the miser's great estate. Should this be ques- tioned, I would only have to produce the record of the marriage." "A stupenduous project, Angelina ;" remarked Ro- dolph, while his countenance betrayed something of doubt and misgiving.  "Stupenduous let it be; are we not equal to it?" said the daring woman, in a spirited and determined tone; "Rodolph," she added, "what is life without the means of living? and what is life without ambition? Hope-  less poverty is worse than death; it crushes ambition,  lays a leaden hand upon the boldest aspirations of ge- nius, cripples every energy of the soul, and dampens the ardor of the most hopeful; it even puts out the di- vine fires of love, embitters the sweetest pleasures of life, and makes our very existence a curse. Here is a chance of gaining that which at once will place you   THE FALLEN ANGEL.       225 and I in circumstances to gratify our vaulting ambi- tion. Play the game well, and there's no hazard." "Perhaps it might succeed." "Say not perhaps, it must and will succeed. Say that you but consent to the plot; then may we promise ourselves a long hey-day, fair sailing, and many gol- den rounds of pleasure for years to come." "Command, and I will obey." "Enough; to-night I'll dream of hoarded treasures, of a gorgeous mansion, of splendid equipage, of rich- jewels and sparkling diamonds. Where shall I next see you, and when?" "To-night I will be till twelve o'clock in the Billiard Saloon, adjoining your apartments; if it be needful, send for me there." "I will, adieu. Think upon the wealth that's soon to be ours." "Be assured my thoughts can dwell on nothingelse, except bloody murder."The latter part of the sen- tence was half aside, and in an undertone, not intended to reach the ear of Angelina; yet it did, and caused her to doubt his courage. Then to herself she said: "If Rodolph's coward conscience shrink from the haunting ghost of bloody murder, my own hand must do the deed. Now, I go to Hano, and will plant upon his hated lips my last Judas kiss. The bullock pre- pared for the slaughter, licks the butcher's hand ere he  bleeds."    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5840-00000116"/> CHABPTER IL. Perceiving.- it Rodolph, a faint-heartedness at the thought oof blood, Angelina grew distrustful of the sternness of his nature, and fearing a failure,deter-   p mined to sound the mind of another -one whom she thought more reckl ess. The individual now fixed upon  in her mind,' was Orla Radcliff, a young man, connect- t ed with the Billiard -Saloon -already mentioned, and over, whom -she had acquired great influence. She was -not long ending an opportunity to open her mind to Radcliff upon -the subject ; presum ing him not verY scrupulous, she felt confident of williigghim to her purpose; yet'she proceeded t-0-unfold, with a degree of caution, her diabolical plot. The YOUDg mau lis- tened with greedy ear, and seemed -at first to fall in with the scheme; but when Angellina's whole plan was fully developed, she perceived that something like a shudder ran 'over lifin ; at this she changed her tact, and straightway began to dwell upon Hfan'o's unamia- ble traits of character, and his illiberal and miserly dis-  l position; and represented that he had trifledl with her affections, and made her false promises. Thus she feuc- ceededin allaying, meas-arably, his qualms-of conscience' in view of the dreadful deed contemplated; but the most potent argument, and that which finally, deter- mined him in favor of the conspiracy, was a liberal promise of gold, when the affair was consummated. 226   Tim: FAT, Lux AxGGTr,., Orla Rladcliff, notwithstaliding his consent to a' crime so black and damning, was not without conscience, por without tender s ' pathies.. No sooner had Angelina left him alone, than he began to repent--; and was hear- -fily sorry for having P-ledged himself to become an ac- complic e for the -commission of a 'crime 'so inious as the contemplated murder. As I ba-ve said, the BI'lliard Saloon, was situated near the apartments occupied by Angelifaa. On -the night oft the same day she, had, opened her plot to -Ro- dolph and Radcliff, at a late hour, the latter having left the Billiard Saloon, in which Rodolph and - few others were playing, he was walkzin'g- ly, up and-, down the floor of an1 anti-chamber-, : in great purturbation of mind. An acquaint 8Fthis, whose -name was Boswell, passing, out of the saloon' chanced to observe through an open door, the agitated air of Radcliff; immediately entering thoe chambei, he ac- costed- him thus: "1rhat, Orla what you look in trouble."

Rest easy, my good fellow; I ven- ture to predict there'll be no blood shed." Saying which, Boswell took his departure-fully impressed that the young man had been hoaxed. Scarcely had he disappeared, when Angelina enter- ed. In a moment divining the cause of Radcliff's rueful looks, she said:  "Why do you keep away, Orla? Look not so pale and sad. I rely upon your fidelity." "You may, upon my fidelity to God and humanity." "Is not your mind made up 2" "Yes,-to have no hand in the murder."  "Murder, you call it, to cut the throat of a dog  We meditate no murder; only intend ridding the world of a wretch, whose life is of less value to man- kind than his money would be."

"Persuade me not ;-my hands are unstained; let me never defile them in blood." "Gold will purify, and make them white as snow. Now let not your faint heart draw back, and so lose thy reward. But say no more for the present. Go bid Rodolph come to me;- I have need of him." As soon as- Radcliff had gone out, Angelina said to' herself: "Nothing better did I expect of Orla; he's without courage,-and would have his cowardice pass for the curbing and checks of conscience. Give me a man of nerve. Rodolph, too, I distrust; to talk of throat- cutting, gives him a whey face; but with me at his back, he dare not flinch." In a few minutes Rodolph came in, pale as Ham- let's ghost, and trembling like an aspen leaf. "What news Rodiolph " said Angelina, in a tone that was intended to inspire him with confidence." "I have heard none ;" he answered in a feeble voice. 'I've seen Hano,-and am more than ever con- vinced that he deserves not another day to live. He visits me to-morrow night-and for the last time; the earth must be rid of him-and let it be at once. Come at an early hour in the morning, that our business may be arranged in due time. Our marriage must date prior to his death." "Let us weigh the matter well, Angelina; deeds of blood are not lightly to be considered."    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5840-00000119"/> 232       THE FATeiS ANGEL. "In that you are wrong, Rodolph; the less consid- ered the better. Reflection but conjures up ghosts to excite our fears. The work is begun; and we'll not pause till ready to count our gains." Now turning about to withdraw from the chamber, she added: "I shall expect you at sunrise." Rodolph bowed, but answered not in word. Soon as Angelina was out of hearing, he said to himself: "Still is she unshaken in her bloody purpose. I could wish the dreadful deed had never been con- ceived."  \gKh  '  I . 'A '   CHAPTER III. On the following morning, Rodolph hastened to Angelina, filled with new fears and dreadful forebod- ings. "Dear Angelina," said he, "I've passed a misera- ble night; such dismal dreams as tortured my wretch- ed brain, were never given to poor mortal before. Me- thoughtI' d taken out my dagger to kill Hano; as I was about to strike, he started back a pace, threw up his hands, and looked so pitiful, 1 straightway relented, Then you shrieked in my ear like a very fiend, up- braiding me; and with fearful epithets urged me on. Thus goaded to desperation, I stabbed him; made a cruel gash, but not mortal; I drew my steel again, and aimed to plunge it to his heart; he warded off the blow. Now falling upon his knees, and bending upon me an imploring look, he prayed me, for heaven's sake, to spare his life. Again I relented,: and again you shrieked in my ear,--and with ten-fold more fury than before,-called me coward, villain, fool! and snatching a dagger from your own bosom, threatened my life, if I did not take his. Like a demon, I again fell upon the bleeding wretch-gave him blow upon blow, gash upon gash,--and cut and carved him most horribly: still he did not die. Overcome and sickn i- ed by the bloody scene, I sank exhausted to the floor; whereupon you rushed forward, and with your own 20              (233)    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5840-00000120"/> 234      THE FALLEN ANGEL. dagger dispatched him. Now filled with dismay at the sight of our murdered victim, I fled; and after going afar, concealed myself in a deep, dark cave of the earth. But not long had I buried myself in that dismal solitude, when Hano's bloody ghost appeared to my horror-stricken sight; so great was the shock, I instantly awoke: and for' an hour after, my heart  thumped like a hammer against my aching ribs." "Tell me not of idle dreams; such weakness be- comes you not, Rodolph; leave visions to weak wo- men-a man should give them no heed ;" replied Angelina, after listening with breathess awe and trembling limbs to the narration of Rodolph's dismal dream.  "True, it was but a dream," rejoined he, "'yet of so appalling a nature,-it shook my very soul; and in spite of me, a terrible impression still remains." "Where now is the firmness I thought to find in you? Resolution already grows pale, and faints when shadows appear. Such being the measure of your strength, I must lean upon my own." After much persuasion, she succeeded, to a great extent in quieting the apprehensions awakened by his dream; and he consented to assume Hano's name, and with her go through the forms of marriage. A min- ister was procured to officiate on the occasion, who was an entire stranger to all the parties ; and every pre- caution used both for secresy, and to make the transac- tion appear legal. As the hour drew on, in which Hano was to receive   THE FALLEN ANGEL.      235 his quietus, Rodolph's courage again began to fail,-- and his heart sank within him-whether. from the workings of conscience or of cowardice, it was some- what difficult to determine. At any rate, such became the state of his mind, that he despaired of being able to carry out their nefarious plot, by consummating the last act, which was to stain his hands with blood. Go- ing to Angelina, he said: "The deed is too dark for me; I cannot enact so dire a tragedy." "Why then did you promise me Why, would you have my- expectations sit in air?- Ah, only that I might experience the humility of coming down again, and feel the pangs of disappointment. Here our high hopes, with all our plans, suddenly fall to the ground; and for the reason, you have not the courage to go forward."  "The thought of taking life paralyses me." "The thought of being hanged for it," whispered Agelina to herself,- paralyses you more." Then speaking: aloud, she said: What is life? a brittle thread, liable any moment to be broken. And what is the life of one man, when thousands are dying dai- ly? And is not death, sooner or later, the lot of all? Better men than Hano, are falling every hour. Think how many are wasting by slow diseases, or tortured' by burning fevers and racked with pain, who would welcome death as a kind messenger.

"Being a wicked man, he's unprepared to die." "He's well prepared--a fit dish for Satan, who shall have him. Where should he go but to perdition? Would you have hell defrauded? Worthier men are roasting there; why shouldn't he?" But his blood will be upon me. There is a day of judgment." "And hope you for heaven? your presumption is greater than your courage." "I want no greater sins to answer for, than I've al- ready committed." ' Among the multitude you've been guilty of, and in the long black list registered against you, this one would scarce be noticed. But if for heaven you've any ground of hope, then bid farewell to me; I'm go- ing the other way. And since to perdition doomed, I'm resolved not to go for a trifling cause nor light offense." '; There, may be some choice, even in hell." "If you'll put the miser out of the way, I doubt not it'll gain you some distinction in that region, and perhaps secure you a seat in a warm corner. If it be a crime to send Hano to perdition before his time, that crime we've already committed in thought and heart; the very deed would stain our souls no deeper." "I pray you let me rest a moment; I'm faint and sick at heart."And he sat down, sighed, moaned, and passed his hand over his aching brow and throb- bing temples, as if to sooth his distracted and fever- ish thoughts.

He will call again,--perhaps to- morrow night, if you press him.', "Ay,-you want a Chance to dream again;' I fear yon never intend to play the man." Finally,' thinking it better to exercise p ti&amp;ce, An- gelina consented to a postpoinemient of the affair, and allowed Rodolph to depart, with the promise of re- turning the next day. Hano came punctually at the appointed hour, and was received by Angelina with smiles and blandish- ments, and treated in every respect as the adored of her heart. A more discerning eye, however, than Hano's might have seen the deceitfulness of her smiles, and the hollowness of her caresses and professions of love. Before his departure, she prevailed on him to pledge his word that he would sup with her the fol- lowing evening. By no means confident that Rodolph's courage would not again desert him, she determined on sounding Oria Radcliff once more. And for the purpose, invit- ed him into her room soon after Hano- had taken his leave, where she set before him the most tempting beverages, and urged him to drink freely. After his cup had been filled and emptied several times,- she deemed him in a fit condition to enter into her views; and broaching the subject of the secret plot which she had before divulged to him, said:    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5840-00000122"/> 238      TEE FALLEN ANGEL. "Orla, you want money, and so do I. A few thou- sand would make us immensely happy. You know as well as I, there are those who have it in great abundance, that are not worthy of it. Hano is oneof them; his heaps of silver and gold lie useless in his coffers,--while we have a bare subsistenc. Were it ours, what magic power it would at once possess and with what marvelous powers it would suddenly invest us! What splendid creations it would call into exist- ence! Money, in the hands of those who know how to use it, is omnipotent. Besides a thousand other  blessings, with it, we can buy a good name; purchase character, influence, glory and renown! Money con- ceals moral and physical deformities; it hides a black heart, veils bad manners, and gives beauty to ugliness. What say you Orla, shall we not put our hands into Hano's coffers .?"        '  ( Can we do it without being guilty of his death?" "What signifies his death? Why set so much value upon life? Are not whole armies of men sent upon the battle field to be slaughtered-and often upon the slightest pretext for war. Then you see how little va- lue governments set upon the lives of their best and bravest subjects and citizens. Yet in your esteem a villain's life is a thing of consequence; his death a great evil,-while at the same time the earth groans to  be rid of him, and perdition impatiently waits to re- ceive him." You almost persuade me, Angelina, it would be   THE FiLLEN ANGEL.      239 doing good service to mankind, to give the fellow a push towarrds that borne whence no traveler returns." "Believe me, Orla, you could scarcely do the world a greater good; besides putting out of the way an ex- tortioner, a usurer and an oppressor of the poor, you would be putting dead capital into circulation." "Another glass of good old Holland-gin, and doubt not I'll be clear on the subject; at the same time fill- ing up and turning off another bumper. "The plot now looks feasible, and the deed commendible ;" he remarked, setting down his glass. "Now swear to me you Will assist Rodoll-\to give Hano his quietus."  I will swear ; where's your bible  -  "Bible! I've not seen such a thing for a twelve month.," "The more pity for you. I've one in the anti-cham- Der." "Bring it in." "I will ;" and he went out. "If he but takes an oath to do the deed, I have him; for to swear falsely, he solemnly believes would damn him forever. - But let me follow the fellow; he's not to be trusted alone with his conscience. H-e might take a thought to pray over it, before he returns." Saying which, she hastened after him; and as soon as the bible was found, urged him upon the spot to take the oath. Swearing to take the life of Hano at her bidding, he kissed the sacred book, and they separated for the night.    <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5840-00000123"/> CHAPTER IV. Late in the afternoon on the following day, the three conspirators were seated together in a private chamber, conversing in low tones. On a table near by was a bottle of wine, and a decanter of fourth proof brandy. Rodolph whispered with white lips: "It's a deed when done; that never can be undone." "Strong reason that,? replied Angelina, why it should be done-and done quickly." "With respect to wrongs that may be rectified, we have less care; but in performing an act, unalterable in its nature, and necessarily connected with eternal re- sults, and carrying with it endless consequences, we may with much reason pause." "There is your weakness again: at the point of victory, and in the very moment we're ready to snatch the prize, you must pause; thus you ensure defeat. What a general you would make, Rodolph! When your regiments were about to make their last charge, while victory hovering over their arms, was ready to perch on your banners, you would suddenly command  a halt; and while you paused to reflect on the eternal  consequences of the action, crowning victory, snatch- ing away the laurels with which she was about to en- circle your brow, would fly away in disgust,-and, perhaps alight on the enemy's standard." "Say what you may, Angelina, 'tis a fearful thing (240) !}   THE FALLuN ANGEL.      241 4to shorten human life by the hand of violence, 'My heart sickens at thought of it." "A; sickly heart is'yoursRodolph. And how beats yours, Orla Radcliff?, Come, no sighs, nor ghastly looks-speak what's on your mind." "There's a hereafter, Angelina ;" gasped Orla, with difficult utterance. - "True, there is a hereafter-a great hereafter; and in view of, that hereafter, remember your oath." "My oath-yes, I've taken an oath, a damning oath to do a damning deed." "Ay, a solemn oath, which to keep-not, is damna- tion beyond redemption." "My oath binds me not to the thing I've sworn to do, unless you command me; and I entreat you, com- mand me not-or if you do, command me not to do it." "Fixed as the throne of the everlasting is my pur- pose; stern is the decree--Hano dies. If your dag- gers fail,I cCarry steel that's true. But the curses of heaven light upon you Radcliff, if you keep not your oath!"

"My heart is paler than my face, Angelina;" ob- served Rodolph. Your liver is whiter than either;" she whispered to herself, as she passed the brimming tumblers to their hands. One potation created a thirst for another; the glasses directly went round again; and after awhile, again. Soon the young men began to brighten; color return- ed to their faces, and a sparkle was seen in their eyes when the miser's gold was mentioned; no shudder was now perceptible, when they spoke of blood; the horrifying sound of the word murder, lost its chilling effect; and conscience letting go its hold, stood avaunt. A little after night-fall, Hano made his appearance; Rodolph and Orla concealed themselves, while Ange- lina ushered him into the drawing room. Spending very little time in compliments with her guest, she spread her table, and hastened supper, fearing to make any delay, lest Rodolph and Radcliff becoming sober, should lose their courage. Having prepared the sup- per and conducted Hano to the table, she begged to be excused a moment; then going to Rodolph and Or- la, she inquired '-Are you ready?" The young men looked at each other, but returned no answer. Turning to the decanter, Angelina filled three glasses, saying: "A beverage for eachl--then comes the last act in the tragedy."Tipping thel, glasses, the three drank. O '   THE FALLEN ANGEL.      243 "Now, if murder be committed,", remarked Rodolph, "Iet it be laid on king alcohol." "Never fear," replied Angelina, I'll bear the sin, and answer for it in Heaven's court. Lay all the guilt on me. Now, I'll go engage him in conversation; his back is turned to the door through which you will enter; when I strike upon the tea-salver, both of you advance with drawn daggers; let your aim be sure, and bury your steel deep in his heart, that no cry of murder be heard."Now leaving them, she re- turned to the apartment where Hano was at supper, and seating herself at table opposite Hano, and facing the door through which the assassins were to enter, she commenced a rapid and desultory conversation- being excited both by what she had taken of strong drink, and by the thought of the bloody deed which she expected the next moment to witness. Hano could not have failed to notice her confusion, and the peculi- arity of her manner; yet being aware that she some- times stimulated, he no doubt readily attributed her strangeness to having partaken too freely of wine. Directly Angelina gave the signal. "She strikes upoi the salver," said Rodolph, " lead the way Radcliff.'2  "I prefer to follow you ; returned the other. You have sworn to slay him, when she bids you; I am bound by no oath." "Would to heaven I were not ;" said Radcliff, stag- gering towards the door, which he partly opened, peeDing in at Hano. "He eats well ;" whispered he    <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5840-00000125"/> "     THE FALLEN ANGEL. in a drunken tone, "it looks a pity to spoil the fellow's supper." Again closing the door, and turning to his companion, he said:  I've taken on too much steam Rodolph, I fear making a botch of it." "For heaven's sake beware of that; an outcry would confound us. I'd rather do it myself than have it badly done." "Then go in." How my heart thumps! Radcliff." "Mine is up in my throat; the devil take me, if my breath is not likely to be stopped before Hano's."  Angelina, again leaving the table, hastened to in- quire the cause of' their delay. Entering the camber, she said: ' I struck upon the salver; why did you not come?" "Something holdsme back ;" answered Rodolph. "' Tis you cowardice, villain! Let the devil push you forward. Ye are dastards, both! I'll turn cut  throat myself; and mark me, if I begin, I'll not stop with severing Hano's wind-pipe. Wretches, forget you that gold is to be the reward of the brave deed?" "But suppose the murder bring our necks to the halter,--what will Hano's money be worth to us then?" "See you this dagger?" said Angelina, in a stern voice and with flashing eyes, as she drew the glitter- ing steel from her bosom; and after bending a fierce, tigress gaze on Rodolph, she added, "If you take not lano's life, this weapon will take yours." "Let me drink again; then I'll assail him, if hell   ,:,- ,; E(X LC L  . OLYrtkb s245' yawns upon the instant." She filled his cup; and af- ter he'd quaffed it, said: "Now put on courage; one thrust with your dag- ger, and all is over; then comes our hey-day." "Follow me Radcliff;" said Rodolph, pushing back the door, and going in. "I will," answered the other, " even to hell--since we are on the road." Hano, hearing a noise, looked around. On percei- ving two men advancing with drawn daggers, he be- came alarmed,-and springing to his feet, cried out: "Who are these men? Assassins, what would you with me?" As he uttered the last word, Rodolph bounding towards him, struck an ineffectual blow, inflicting but a slight wound. Hano threw up his hands, crying:   Spare me, spare me I for heaven's sake spare my life!"  Rodolph touched with pity, and suddenly remem- bering his fearful dream, refused to strike again. Rad- cliff, now urged on by Angelina, rushed forward and stabbed the victim several times, but inflicting no mor- tal wound. The wretched man falling upon his knees begged for his life; Radeliff could do no more, and relenting, threw down his weapon.  Angelina, now filled with desperation, and drawing her dagger, sprang forward like an enraged tigress, and by a sin- gle stroke plunged her murderous weapon to Hano's    <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5840-00000126"/> 248      THE FALLEN A NGL. heart. He sank to the floor and after a groan' and a struggle, breathed his last. 4( Now 'tis done,-and well done!" exclaimed the murderess in a fiendish tone, and looking gloatingly upon the crimsoned steel that bad pierced the heart of her victim. "I would not have struck that final blow for the wealth of kingdoms ;" said Rodolph, gazing with ago- ny upon the expiring man. "Nlor I;" said Radcliff, shuddering. "Wonderous magnanimity 1" exclaimed Angelina, mockingly, "noble hearted men ha! hal Whose daggers cut, gashed, and mangled the wretch so bar- barously a" "And who set us on 1" "Not your own bravery. You dastards but tortur- ed him; I ended his misery. But delay not; take away his body-and dispose of it as I've advised-you." Instantly obeying her commands, they carried off the lifeless remains of the unfortunate Hano to a cer- tain locality where murders had been frequently com- mitted; this they did that suspicion might scent ano- ther direction, which otherwise would likely have pointed to them.  There is a pitch of wickedness, which when first reached, the mind of the transgressor is apt to be shocked at thought of its own depravity. It was, so with Angelina; when she came to look properly at the atrocious deed she had committed, her mind re- coiled, and a sense of horror filled her guilty soul.   TREF FALLxEN ANGLr.      247 Now giving herself up to the pangs of remorse, bitter regrets and self-reproach, her heart was lacerated and' wrung by inconsolable grief. At length wrought up to frenzy, and her feverish brain running wild, she saw, or thought she saw the ghost of Hano coming towards her, and pointing to the fatal wound her dagger had made. "Alas, bloody ghost," she cried, "take pity, and vanish from my sight! You drive me to madness I Show me not that bleeding gash; withered be the hand that inflicted it I Woe is me! for my sins are greater than I can bear."  "Heartless, treacherous-woman," said the appari- tion, " know thou, that from hell's confines let loose for a season, I come to be thy tormentor." "Spare me," she shrieked, "Oh, spare me! poor ghost spare me!" "Ay, as thou did'st me, in plunging thy poinard to my heart. May the worm that never dies, gnaw thy guilty conscience day and night. May the fire that is never quenched, kindle around thy sin-polluted soul! May remorse evermore rankle in thy unfeeling bosom! Thorns and thistles bestrew thy pathway to the end of life's journey!

Oh! oh! -oh!" she cried, turn- ing from the apparition, and looking heavenward. "The pangs thou feel'st giveth me joy.

Thus-I'll remind thee of the sunny hights of innocence and purity, whence thou hast fallen ;-ay, even to the lowest depths of infamy."  ' Oh, name it not; tell me rather of hell's tor- ments."  "There was a time when thy spirit was spotless, thy mantle white as snow; a time when there was no blem- ish upon thy fair name, no cloud in thy blue sky, no thorn, no asperaties along the blooming pathway thou did'st tread.

At this the apparition vanished from her sight.

"All smoke, Mr. Boswell; it was all smoke! Just as you predicted, so it turned out a joke, at my expense." "I fear sirs it may be seriously at your expense be- fore all's over.

Alas, not only does this crushing grief fall upon my heart, but I must also endure the terrible accusation of being acces- sory to his death! Palsied be the tongue that dares utterit-! And may the blackness of darkness, and the pains of hell forever be the portion of the vile wretch who dared cast on me the foul suspicion!" "I believe she could curse the bark off a tree ;" said Boswell to himself, as he unceremoniously withdrew; "I'd better be making my escape ;" he added, and not without some reason for his apprehensions. "How in heaven's name," said Angelina, "came h/e by a clue to the plot "  "Through certain words," answered Radcliff, "which I incautiously let drop." "Miserable wretch! well you then deserved to have your tongue cut out." "Would to God I'd lost my tongue before I took that wicked oath to stain my hands with Hano's  blood!"   THE FALLEN ANGEL.      255 "Say no more;" remarked Rodolph, " it must now be our study to conceal what we've done." "To do that,"Tresponded Angelina, "more blood must be shed; Boswell must be puC out of the way." "Lay a trap for him,:' answered Rodolph, " and let us do it while our hands are in." After a long parley, it was decided that Boswell should also receive his quietus,--and at the earliest possible moment. As he regularly frequented the billiard saloon, an opportunity was not long wanting for carrying out their dire and bloody intentions against him; his next visit to the billiard saloon was his last; decoyed into a private room by Radcliff, who pretended that he had something to divulge concerning the death of Hano. Immediately upon entering the apartment, he was set upon by Rodolph and Angelina, who with drawn dag- gers had been lying in wait for him. The surprised man was quickly slain, aud without being able to utter a cry of murder. Putting his body in a box, which they had previously prepared, they carried him to the basin of a canal not far distant, and putting gravel in the box with the corpse, sunk it in deep water. The assassins now felt secure, as Boswell, the only living witness against them, was out of the way. And Angelina, now reckless, and bent on making the most of the opportunity gained through blood-shed, immediately took possession of Hano's dwelling which was a splendidly furnished mansion.

"Ho, ho! Silvester, you're the most pious manI've conversed with for many a day."  "I'm no saint Edwin; nor by any means a pattern of piety; I look upon this matter philosophically; and have honestly come to the conclusion that the windows of heaven have really been opened of late: hence this general looking up, and the wonderful interest that community, all at once, as it were, is taking in spirit- ual things." "Come along then, and let us discuss the matter. And by the way here comes our mutual friend, Fla- vins ; he is also an outsider,-and I may say an infidel: let us ask his opinion of this wonderful phenomenon, if 1 may so call it." "Ah, my good friends, Silvester and Edwin," said Flavius as he came up, "what news a "The latest news to me," replied Edwin, "is this religions revival, which I understand is spreading like fire in a stubble field, from one end of the land to the other. And by the way, Flavius, since you are no   THEi GRnAT REBVVAL.      21 bigot nor fanatic, tell us what you think about this great revival " "I've never sought to disguise my infidel sentiments you know; yet I must confess the more I see of this world, the more I'm convinced that it can't. do without religion. . Besides, I have perceived that these church- going people, usually do more than any other class, to improve society, and benefit and elevate poor humani- ty. They are rarely among the disturbers of the peace and the pests of society. Had we no worse citi- zens than church people, there'd be littleuse for watch- houses, police, &amp;c. Not but there are many honest, clever fellows among us outsiders ; for I yield not the palm to any Christian with respect to benevolent intentions, sympathy for the distressed, and good will towards the great brotherhood of humanity. Notwith. standing this, however, I'm convinced, beyond a doubt, that Christianity in our land does more to prevent vice, crime and injustice, than all our laws, chains, prisons and scaffolds. Not only so, religion whether it be of human or divine origin, gives light, hope and comfort to the mind; and such light, hope and comfort, as nothing else can give. If you seek for the happy and content, expect to fnd them among the enlightened pious. Observation having satisfied me that the Chris- tian religion, exercises a wholesome influence upon the human mind, and tends to ameliorate the condition of mankind every where, I can have no feeling of hostil- ity towards a religious revival,-especially such a one as is now in progress; which is no spasmodic excite-    <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5840-00000134"/> Sa2     TnTi GaiAT REVIVAL. ment, characterized by wild fanaticism; though deep and all-pervading the interest felt in the work, yet it goes on quiietly, steadily, and rationally; taking hold too, of minds, in many instances the most obdurate and unbending."  "Upon none of those points am I disposed to join issue with young " replied Edwin, "but the question that most puzzles me, is this--whence comes this mys- terious influence'that's movingwith such mighty force the great sea of a million minds Is it light from heaven? S our friend Silvester professes to believe or  is it of the earth, earthy "' "That matter," answered Flavius, "I must leave for you and Silvester to discuss." Saying which, he bade the young men good day, and turned off in another  direction. -i Well, -now then, Silvester, you take the position that this revival is from heaven; I maintain that it's all of this lower world,-that it began, and will end upon the earth: besides, that it is evenescent, and must pass away as an empty cloud, having effected no en- during good."  Then, since you are the challenger," responded Silvester, go on with your argument." "tSo Iwill. Now I demand, if this awakening is from heaven, why didn't it-come ere this? What apo- logy is there for this new start, this late impetus, and sudden waking up? 'Has religion all at once been in- vested with new charms? Has hell come a step closer? Or has the old ship of Zion rang her last bell,   THE GiEAT REVIVAL.      26 that there's such a rush to get on board? I imagine you will grant that Christianity wore as many attrac- tions in 1857, as it does now in 1858; that the golden gates of heaven were open then as now; that perdi- tion gaped as wide, and that the devil was as big a devil, and had as many claws then as now? Grant these, and where is the apology for the late revival?" "I grant you," replied Silvester, "Christianity has been invested with no new charms: God, who is the same yesterday, to-day and forever, gave to man in due time, a perfect,system of religion,--susceptible of improve- ment only in the practice of it. When men'behold not the excellencies of this religion, 'tis because of the blindness of their minds and the hardness of their hearts. That heaven was as willing in 1857 as in 1858; to pour-down this glorious light upon the earth, and draw the hearts of the people to spiritual things there is no reason to doubt. Had the churches tight- ly improved the means of grace, and the celestial-illu- mination previously given, doubtless this great revival would have occurred at an earlier period; but so earthly, and so perverted is the human heart, that we must have line upon-line, and precept upon precept.' And God seeing that nothing could break the hold which'the affections of the people had upon the things of the earth, but that of bringing ruin upon the very foundation of their worldly hopes, he sent a crash among the banks, and caused wide spread pecuniary distress throughout the land, which was felt by the rich even more than by the poor. This great calami-    <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5840-00000135"/> 264      TiE GREAT REVIVAL. y as we all esteemed it, proved a blessing in disguise , it haa, in a measure, snatched our thoughts and hear' i zway from materializing influence, and turned them to better things; we are all beginning to see 'that the worship of mammon wont pay. "Then the pith of your argument is, that the hand )f heaven by this blasting stroke upon the worldly fortunes of men, has so far dislodged from the heart, the love of money, as to make room for the light and love that cometh down from above?" "You understand me, I perceive." "I must urge one grand objection against your  whole theory, itis this.: when our affections are placed ipon the things of earth, they are where they ought ;o be." "Christianity, by no means enjoins that we despise or neglect temporal things; but that we use the good hings of earth without abusing them. But that our  minds and hearts should be wholly engrossed by tem- Poralities, and the affairs of this life, seems to me a reat absurdity, if you grant the soul immortal. If our existence is to terminate with the brief period al-  dotted us on earth, your position is then tenable; but upon the hypothesis that there is another and a better world, it unquestionably becomes us to act with 'eference to the future. Not only is this necessary in . Drder to fit us for another and a higher life, but it's es- sential to our happiness here, that the mind be fortified with the hope of a hereafter. The assurance of living again, gives interest to our life on earth; stamps ex-   ...... -.Vaaa    s   265 itence with importance, and confers infinite value upon the mind." "I own, Silvester, it's very pleasant to think, that when done with earth, we are to be transplanted to the skies; and he that is ful]y persuaded of it, cannot fail to find therein, an incentive to the practice of virtue and walking uprightly." - "And do you doubt the soul's immortality, Edwin?" I regret being compelled Silvester to answer you in the affirmative. And that doubtforyears, has hung like a dark cloud upon my spirit; and when by chance I may bask in the sunshine of pleasure, that dread thought of annihilation coming up, puts out the light, and all is gloom again. The prospect of- an eternal sleep in the cold grave, casts a dismal shadow on the fairest and brightest objects that surround me in life, and turns to bitterness the sweetest cups of pleasure." "In that respect I'm prepared to sympathize with you, having been haunted myself by similar doubts  and tortured by the most chilling and painful appre- hensions touching the question of the mind's immor- taitv. But every shadow has disappeared, - e last doubt is gone." By this time the young men had reached the resi- dence of Mr. Irwin, Silvester's father: each being inclined to continue the conversation, they walked into ;he garden, and seating themselves in a pleasant arbor 'esumed the colloquy. "If a man die, shall he live again?' is a question vhich Job asked, but to my mind did not satisfactorily 23    <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5840-00000136"/> 26Of     Tam GREAT REVIVAL. answer:;" observed Edwin, "and your convictions being now clear on the subject, I shall be greatly obliged if you can, by any means, chase the clouds from my sky." "Everything surrounding us in nature," responded Silvester, ' intimates immortality to man. Even these fragile flowers, these delicate spires of grass, and each herb, shrub and tree, whisper to us of immortality; for' they themselves are immortal." ' Immortal? how is that 2" "Eternity is stamped upon all entity; the earth, and everything that lives on the earth, ay, every par- ticle of matter in the wide universe may justly boast of immortality "      i "But see, I pluck this flower," remarked Edwin, tak- ing up a sweet blossom that grew at his feet, "watch how soon it will wither and die. Do I not thus con- found you?" "By no means. Science teaches us that all matter  is indestructible; that which seems destruction, is but  decomposition ; the flower may fade, droop and fall to the ground, the green grass may wither and decay; but nothing is lost that giveth to either, form, beauty and fragrance."  "Ah, but when the blushing flower and the spire of grass have perished, where are the delicate tints of j the one, and the deep green of the other?"  I answer, those rich hues of purple and emerald, have returned to the great fountain of light; for all color is derived from light."   -TH GREAT YEXVVAL.      '2a "And where is the life of the decayed flower- and withered herb .? "Gone back to the ocean of electricity, that fills, permeates and pervades illimitable creation. Nothing absolutely dies,--nothing perishes; indestructibility is a law of nature; and that law is eternal, universal and unchangeable. If then, indestructibility be stamped upon every particle of unthinking, unconscious matter shall we doubt the imperishability of mind  Can it be that the towering intellect, ever reaching upward, and sending forth thought more swift, and more vivid than the lightning, shall perish and cease to be, while meaner things, even the very dust of the earth must remain forever Gross matter being immortal, 'we may with reason conclude, that the finer and more sub. limated essence of mind, must be equally so." "The argument seems plausible, yet by no means conclusive. Silvester, I've stood by the couch of the dying, and seen mortal man breathe his last breath; but saw no spirit rise from his lifeless form,-discerned no traces of a soul's-departure. Show me a spirit and I'll believe; no faith have I in things which cannot be seen." "You forget that some of the most powerful ele- ments and agents in nature are invisible, and have never been seen by mortal eye. I say the most pow- erful: look when the heavens gather blackness and terror; when the earth trembles, and mighty thunders roll; what is it that upheaves the mountain cloud, and sends it careering wildly taroughi space? what is it    <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5840-00000137"/> 268      THE GREAT REVIVAL.  that bends the stubborn oak, wrings its strong branches, and dashes many a lofty tree crashing to the earth? 'Tis the unseen winds--the invisible air. Again, what keeps this great globe in its orbit And what links together in eternal harmony the circling spheres, the revolving planets, that perpetually whirl through measureless space with inconceivable velocity? 'Tis an invisible agent, an unseen power, which we call attraction and repulsion-or the centripital and centri- fugal forces. Then why disbelieve that the soul exists after death, because you do not see it? The spirit being a substance too etherial to be apprehended by our out- ward senses, eludes observation ; but we are not to con-. elude, that because it leaves the body, and departs from earth unseen, it must therefore necessarily turn to nothing. We can hardly doubt our immortality, if we but  consider the nature of our moral And intellectual facul-  ties, and attentively observe the laws of mind. Be-  sides, every emotion within our bosoms, the ardent wish, the unsatisfied desire, friendship, love, hope, fear, all indicate immortality." /              i Thus the conversation went on between the young -men for quite a length of time; before separating, Silvester prevailed on Edwin to agree to accompany him the next morning to the business men's prayer- meeting.  Edwin Ainsley was a young man of intelligence, and possessed a warm heart; but unfortunately in his early youth he had been thrown into the society of                        r    THE GREAT REVIVA.       29 such as scoffed at religion, ridiculed everything sacred, and regarded churchgoing people as a deluded class, blinded by bigotry and superstition. Silvester Irwin, although more religiously inclined, had not been brought up under religious influence; but from some fortuitous circumstance, he was lead. into the habit of attending church, and thereby learned to respect religion. The revival now in progress, had deeply interested him from its commencement, though he had not yet seriously thought of becoming religious. He was particularly pleased with the movement, on account of the harmony and good feeling which he saw it was calculated to bring about, and was really producing among the different churches and various denominations, that had hitherto been little inclined to act in concert. In this he discovered a thoughtfulness and a noble trait of character highly praiseworthy, especially in one of his age. For few events could be more desirable than that which was calculated to break down the prejudices, and do away with the animosity and hostility of feeling, that have too long existed bet- ween the different sects--retarding more than any other cause, the progress of Christianity.    <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5840-00000138"/>  - CHAPTER HI The next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, Silvester Irwin and Edwin Ainsley, made' their way to the business men -prayer-meeting: they found the spacious church densely crowded, by a thoughtful, sober, intelligent looking congregation. Prayers were fervently offered; the singing was spiritual, and impressive; occasional remarks were made by laymen and ministers appropriate to the oc- casion, and always brief-as was also their prayers; a deep feeling pervaded the assembly; yetnothing like noisy enthusiasm, at any time, disturbed the sweet serenity which seemed to reign in every mind and heart.  A very peculiar feature of the meeting was, that laymen and ministers of almost every denomination were mingled together, and seemed to enter into one spirit, forgetting alldifferences of creed and opinion. "I have never before seen anything like it;" ob- served Edwin, to his friend Silvester, as soon as the benediction was pronounced, " besides, there is a mys- - terious influence here; sure as we live I felt it run all over me directly after I came in; and I feel it now in every nerve." "Does it affect you only physically?" inquired Sil- vester. "Both mentally and physically ;" replied the other, 270   THE- GZrAT EViVAL.      271 "my mind is singularly impressed that Christianity is true." "But you have ever been wont to idolize reason, while you regarded feeling as proving nothing." "Be that as it may, what I have felt since entering this temple of worship to-day, has done more to con- vince me of the soul's immortality, and that the hand of heaven is in this revival, than did all your fine are guments yesterday."  Silvester was now affected to tears, and his heart was too full to make further answer; After this, Edwin Ainsley not only attended regular- ly himself, the morning prayer-meetings, but induced a large circle of young ladies and young men, among his non-church-going acquaintances, to attend also; a majority of whom, became deeply interested. Among them was a young lady of a philosophical cast of mind, and apparently, possessing but little warmth of heart, who attended merely for the novelty of the affair, and to please her associates, who had become interested in the meetings. Edwin, from some cause was particularly solicitous that this young lady, whose name was Ieloise Greenwood, should be brought under religious influence; but day after day she sat unmoved while others were melted to tenderness, and her friends and acquaintances were weeping and pray- ing around her. Heloise was ever respectful; betray- ing no disposition to scoff at religious things; yet she remained cold and unfeeling as marble, Edwin    <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5840-00000139"/> 723      THE GREAT- REIrVAL. observing her continued indifference, said to her one morning as they went from church: "How is it, Heloise, you alone remain uninterested, among hundreds that daily attend these revival meet- ings? "'Think not so;"- replied the young lady, "I am indeed interested,-that is, I'm interested in seeing the rest of you interested." "But not interested for yourself? I'm sorry for that." "If I c9uld see and feel as you do, Mr. Ainsley," responded Heloise, "that there is something to be gained by becoming religious, I should certainly em- brace it at once."                . "In my estimation, there is much to gain, every- thing to gain by becoming religious. Those who have experienced conversion, testify that it fills the heart with unspeakable joy in this life, and gives an assurance of unfading bliss in the world to come." ' Give me a religion that addresses itself to my un- derstanding and is consonant to reason." "Does not the Christian religion address itself to your understanding? and is it not consonant to right reason? "I do not so understand it." Allow me to convince you, if I can, that Christi- anity is at least rational in theory." I'll listen to you with much pleasure; and should be most happy to be convinced; for whether true or false, a belief in religion is no doubt a source of com- fort to the mind: and this thing of conversion, I sin-   TuE GREAT iREVIVAL. 27 cerely look upon as a happy and sweet delusion., Bul now please, proceed with your argument, and give- me: the rationale of your religiou."   "Well then to begin, I mayaffirm in the first place, that in this life we need light from heaven; for with- out that light we are in utter darkness. Look at it thus-say we push aside the Bible, and strike from the moral heavens the orb of Christianity, where (are we then, and what have we to cheer and comfort us amid the sorrows and afflictions that betide us in thisjarring world, especially in the hour of death.? What know we of God or futurity? We are ignorant of what we are; know not whence we are, nor whither we are go- ing. Our very existence is an enigma; we can know but little of human duty, and are left, at best, to vague conjectures with respect to -a future state." "Ah, but the picture is overdrawn; you color too deeply; we do not go to the Bible for all the knowledge we gain; light is to be derived from other sources; ay, it flows through a thousand and ten thousand other channels." "I grant you; but for the correctness of my. posi- tion, I need but appeal to history, and ask you -to look at what the world was before the light of Christianity shined upon-the benighted nations of the earth; or I might point you to the present condition of heathen- dom, where the gospel has not yet been carried^: what degradation, barbarity, ignorance and wretchedness we everywhere behold - And what is more evident than that civilization uniformly follows in the footsteps    <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5840-00000140"/> f2tL     TxE GRiEAT REvIvAL. of the heralds of Gospel truth? Wherever Christi- anity:goes in its purity, man is elevated, society is improved; laws and governments made more wise and just. If then it be true, and. that it is you will hardly deny, that the world is thus benighted, and hu- manity so deeply sunk in superstition, barbarism and misery, without the light of revelation, it must be ad- mitted there was a necessity in the case,-that light from heaven was needed. Thus far then, we have pre- sumptive evidence that the needed light has been given, -and that that light is Christianity. But this is not all, Christianity comes to us, claiming to be of divine origin, and supporting that claim by external, internal and collateral evidences. It is attested by prophecy and miracle, which constitute the. external testimony; the internal evidence of its divinity, we find in its  adaptation to the condition, the wants and circumstan-  I ces of man; also in the purity of its doctrines, the  holiness of its precepts, and the wisdom and power of  the great and glorious truths it embodies, and which it  enforces upon the minds of men."             [ "And what is the collateral evidence of which you  speak a,                     .  The efficiency of Christianity, its achievements, its 'iiSits, the wonders it has accomplished, and is accom-  plishing; constitute what may be called the collateral evidence.

"How will you account for the wide difference which now exists between Christendom and heathen- dom d Why have not the barbarians progressed, if human progrees can go forward :as well without the aid of the Christian Religion?" "Im inclined to attribute the advancement of man- kind, in Christian lands, to other causes than tlat of religion.

Upon this point, Edwin continued to expatiate, till they had reached the house in which Heloise resided. "I'm unwilling to confess myself vanquished Mr. Ainsley," said Heloise, "and if you'll come in and have a glass of water with me, or wine if you prefer it, we'll sit down and resume the discussion." Edwin readily accepted the invitation, and went in. After taking a glass of water, declining anything stronger, he humorously remarked: "I am now prepared to hear dry arguments." c Listening to your last," retorted Heloise, "is per- haps the cause of my thirst."   There being no one in the parlor to interrupt their conversation, they seated themselves for further debate. - I join issue with you, Mr. Ainsley," remarked Heloise, "upon the question of necessity. You main- tain, if I rightly understand your position, that man- kind needed a revelation: and to supply that necessity heaven had vouchsafed Christianity. I hold that the light of nature and reason are, and ever have been sufficient; that we need no Bible to teach us what we are, whence we are, or whither we're going. Human reason when properly developed, is not as impotent as theologians would have us believe, nor is nature a sealed book as they teach,-to the reflecting mind it is a volume full of instruction. Nature everywhere re- veals a creator; and with ten thousand tongues pro- claims hiswisdom, power and goodness. To-the eye of reason, God appears in all his works; as the poet hath beautifully said :-   THE GREAT REVIVAL.       211" ' He warms in the sun; refreshes in the breeze; Glows in the etars, and blossoms in the trees. Lives through all life; extends through all extent; Spreads undivided, and operates unspent." "In the immensity of creation, we behold the pow- er of God; in the vast variety, beauty, order and har- mony of his works, we see his--wisdom: and if we would contemplate his benevolence, we behold it in the adaptation of everything to beneficient purposes, and in that he withholds not his bounty even from the unworthy. What more in our present state need we know of Deity, than that which nature teaches us?" "Since by -revelation we have received a knowledge of the character and attributes of God, it is easy to see his glorious perfections manifested in the works of crea- tion; but how happened it that such exalted ideas of a supreme being were never conceived until communi- cated to man through his written word, given by in- spiration  Idolatrous nations have ever ascribed to their imaginary Deities abominable attributes, and the vilest passions. A God of immaculate purity and supreme holiness never was conceived of outside of the Bible. But leaving this question where it is, it must at least be conceded that man's relations and duties to God and to his fellow men, as well as the great remedial system or scheme ,of salvation, never could have been learned from -the book of nature.

Edwin directly withdrew; Hleloige following him to the door, expressed the wish that she might soon again have the pleasure of hearing him converse upon the religion he had so lately embraced. "I hope," remarked Edwin, "you will not grow weary of the morning prayer-meetings." "Should iot the revival hold out too long," res- ponded Heloise, with an air of levity, "I expect to see it through." "I trust," rejoined Edwin, "the work may go on till the whole world is converted." "Ha, ha! your high church steeple will topple be- fore that happens ;" said Heloise, humorously adding, "your zeal, Mr. Ainsley, to say the least, is worthy of a good cause."   CHAPTER III. Week after week passed by; and still the morning prayer-meeting was kept up, and the revival feeling continued to spread,-while scores were being con- verted and brought into the church; still Heloise seemed no more interested than at first; she was con- stant in her attendance not only upon the prayer-meet- ings, but also upon preaching and the regular Sabbath services, yet unbelief rendered her heart impenetrable, and there seemed not the remotest prospect of a change in her feelings or sentiments. Edwin, whose heartwas fired with religious zeal, grew more and more solicit- ous that the awakening spirit should reach Heloise. Having failed to affect anything by argument, he tried the power of prayer,-and advised her also to pray; she at first laughed at his proposition, but finding him so earnest, so devoutly sincere, she consented to try the experiment, and promised him that on the next Sab- bath she would pray with as much sincerity as she could. Though Heloise felt herself a confirmed skeptic, yet it's questionable whether she had soberly decided in her mind that Christianity, which had stood the test of centuries, and flourished amid the decay of Empires, living through a thousand revolutions, and witnessing the rise and fall of unnumbered kingdoms, monarch- 24              (281)    <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5840-00000144"/> s and republics, could really be a fable, an invention ' man, having no foundation in truth. Sabbath came; feeling bound to keep her word, Zeloise rose early, and after making her toilet, opened ar chamber window, which looked eastward; it was bright morning, and the sun's golden disk was just aering above the unclouded horizon: bowing upon ar knees, and fixing her eyes upon the rising orb of ay, while she endeavored to lift her heart to God, she us prayed: c Thou Great Creator of the Universe, at whose bid- ng yon fountain of light pours forth his glorious ef- Igence, I entreat thee, cause thy truth to shine upon iy understanding; and open thou the eyes of my ind, that I may know and do thy will. Grant me race divine, and wisdom from above; guide my err- lg feet into the path of righteousness, and show my nful heart the way of holiness. If in prayer and ith thou would'st have me look to thee, O, teach me )pray, and-help me to believe. If in the name of  hristand his atoning merits, thou'dst have me come  thee, O give me faith in the world's redeemer; lead  ie to the foot of the cross, and grant me salvation   i om sin."' Here her voice faltered, and her utterance ecame difficult; for a mysterious influence had touch- d her heart,-and it's adamant was beginning to aelt.  "What means this gush of feeling?" said she in stonishment, to herself, -while her lustrous eyes so un- "ustomed to weep, overflowed; and pearly tears,   likea morning shower in spring, rained down upon her damask cheek. "Really, I am crying!' she ex- claimed, "and what for? It cannot be grief-nor is it joy. What a strange feeling there is about my heart! Can it be a supernatural influence  It's too much to believe that my poor prayer has really reached the throne of high heaven ; yet I feel something with- in my heart, which tells me there is power in prayer." Again claspig her hands, and looking upwards, she said: "O thou who art supreme in power,. wisdom and goodness, graciously grant, if thou art a prayer-answer- ing God, to hear the voice of my supplications; save me from unbelief, chase this darkness from my heart, and cause the snn of righteousness to arise, that I may behold thy glory, receive salvation, and rejoice in hope of life everlasting." In closing the last sentence, an emotion she had never before experienced, suddenly checked her utterance; the lght of heaven broke upon her mind, -her heart was filled with joy unspeakable; and with her soul overflowing with transport and heavenly raptures, she sprang to her feet, clapped her hands, and gave glory to God. Nor did she rest until she had told her joy to all the family. Her parents, being unbelievers, were greatly astonished--as were all her infidel ac- quaintances, when they had listened to her story. The circle with whom she had attended the morning prayer- meetings were overjoyed on hearing the news of her conversion; especially was Edwin Ainsley delighted:;  ?    <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5840-00000145"/> 284      TEH: GREAT REVInAL. and now was his faith in the power and efficacy of prayer greatly strengthened ;-for in this instance he thought he saw it clearly verified. "( How blind I've been!" said Heloise to her unbe- lieving friends, "that religion I once looked upon as the baseless fabric of a vision, I now contemplate as a tower of light built upon coral reefs in the midst of a dark and stormy ocean, to guide the tempest-tossed mariner. How could I have been so absurdly skepti- cal as to disbelieve, and contemptuously reject that glo- rious system of Christianity, on which eighteen centu- ries and a half are looking down,-and which stands like a mighty rock on. the sea shore, against which surging billows for ages have dashed, and spent their fury in vain? Christianity stands an everlasting mon- ument of the power and glory of God. The waves of infidelity may dash against it, and rage and roar, but at last they'll fall harmless at its base." The design of this narrative, it will doubtless be readily perceived, is not to bring foward wonderful he- roes or heroines, who must be followed through mar- velous adventures, and in whose fate the reader is ex- pected to be interested; but rather to sketch a few of the leading incidents, connected with the great religi- ous awakening, which has been in progress near two -months at Cincinnati, and while I write, is still going forward. It is scarcely less curious than interesting to trace -the causes of conversion, and look at the slight means and feeble instrumenntalities, that are often employed to   THE GREAT REVIvAL.  bring about important religious results. The convic- tion and conversion of an avowed infidel, which oc- curred but a few days since, may be traced to the fol- lowing incidental remarks, which dropped from the lips of a silver-haired, venerable looking man, at one of the morning prayer-meetings: "Many years ago," remarked he, rising to his feet 'at the conclusion of a prayer,. "a French philosopher conceived the design of regenerating France ; -having traveled into all parts of the country, and visited every city, town and village, he saw that unhappiness, anxie- ty and misery universally prevailed.  "' This evil I must remedy,' said the philosopher, 'but the cause of the nation's unhappiness must be re- moved-;-and what is it? ah, I see: the laboring classes are overwrought; the people work too hard; I will introduce labor-saving machines, and thus lighten toil; then the people will have more leisure, and be happy.' "So he went to work, and introduced as rapidly as possible every new invention, and all the arts that ci- ilization had any where brought into requisition. Now a much smaller amount of labor was found necessary, and all classes had sufficient leisure. - Then he again looked about him, and traveled abroad, in; hopes of finding a change, and seeing the people content and happy; but it was not so; dissatisfaction and wretch- edness still prevailed.            ; '"Ah, I've made a mistake,' said the philosopher, it is not leisure they want to make them happy; 'tis education.

Now confident that universal happiness must be the result, he looked around, and again traveled abroad.  4 'How is this    said he, 'I have missed it again; knowledge and learning do not bringhappiness; none are happy but the children; and they know as little as the birds on the trees.' "In despair, the philosopher retired to an obscure place in the country to spend his remaining days. After a time he was one day wandering alone through a rural district, not very far from the spot he had cho- sen for his declining years; in a valley he chanced to espy an humble cot,-curious to know what kind of a being or1beingsresided in such a poor and out of the way habitation,he turned his steps towards the little desolate looking cot. Upon reaching it, he found seated atthe door of the decayed and ivy-covered dom- icile, an old man, whose locks were white as snow, whose limbs were palsied, and whose eyes were dim with age; yet in whose countenance there was an air of content, and even of cheerfulness, which the philo- sopher had rarely met with, either in cottage or in pal- ace,-among the rich or among the poor. -'"Ah, a human face once more!' exclaimed the old man, as the stranger drew near; and slowly risng, he took his visitor warmly by the hand.   TE GREAT REVIY&amp;AL,      $X "' Andjcs a human face so rare a sight to you, my venerable friend ' demanded the philosopher, bending an inquisitive and wondering glance upon the: time- worn brow, and furrowed cheek of the hermit.  "'Seldom, very seldom are my fading eyes glad- dened by the face of my fellow man;' replied the old man; then begging the philosopher to be seated on a moss-grown bench by his side, he said-' Let me hear the sound of your voice-'twill be music to my ear.' "'Have you no companion ' inquired the philo- sopher.               .- "'None on earth,-except the birds; they sing to me sweetly; yes, and the flowers too, in my little gar- den, are my companions.'  "'Have you ever been blessed with wife and Chil! dren? ' Yes ;' replied the hermit, turning a solemn and abstracted look upon a weeping-willow, that grew on a little mound but a few rods from his cottage, and after a pause, he said:- 'My eldest son perished near Moscowr in company with many other of Napoleon's brave men, who found dreary graves amid Russian snows. My second son and two daughters were lost at sea. My youngest, and only surviving childa boy of fairest promise, and the hope of my declining years, fell at Waterloo. Beneath yon willow tree, sleep the ashes of my heart-broken wife, and I am left alone.'

"'Indeed your-look bespeaks a mind at rest; yet I'm unable to conceive how a man can be happy who has experienced so many heart-crushing misfortunes, and then at last to be left so desolate, and doomed to die alone How can it be? It puzzles all my philo- sophy.' "'Tis easy explained ' returned the old man calm-  ly, Irve learned to look to heaven for friendship and  consolation; and to lean for protection, upon the strong arm that upholds the mighty universe.' ' He spake in a tone of cheerful confidence, which quite amazed his philosophic companion, who silently and thoughtfully gazed into-the old man's face. After  a pause of some moments, the hermit thus went on-  ' When I see the sun rise in the morning, I look to God, and say: My Father! When he sets in the  evening, I lift my heart in gratitude to the giver of light, and say, Biy Father!

It is not leisure the people want; it is not learning: ah, I have found it out-'tis religion they need,- pure and unde. filed religion; not superstition, not bigotry nor fanati- cism; but a religion that is full of gentleness, kind- ness, charity, faith and hope. :Yes, yes, this is the se- cret I so long have sought, and in vain have expended money and labor to find: here I most unexpectedly stumble upon it-and the great problem of, how to be happy, is solved; --ay 'tis confidenee in God,- faith in a divine Savior, communion with heaven, and the sweet hope of immortality and eternal life. How sim- pie, yet how sublime! With religion, a man is even content in solitude; content without the :sympathy of his fellow men, content to be unknown aind unloved iby human kind,' "'You are right sir,' responded the hermit, 'with. religion, we find true contentment; repose for the longing heart, rest for the weary mind andanxious thoughts. I have tried many conditions in life; I had wealth; but it satisfied not: through wealth I acquir- ed fame and position; still my mind rested not; anx- iety, perplexity, restless ambition, and an undefinable aching void within my breast, rendered me anything But happy. A single day in this solitary retreat, des- pite poverty and loneliness, brings me more sweet en- joyment and unalloyed bliss, than did years, when I was rich and -surrounded by friends and flatterers.' ' I doubt it not;' said the philosopher, drawing a 25    <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5840-00000148"/> 290      THE GREAT REVIVAL. little nearer the old man, lest he should loose a word of what he uttered. 'Yet the philosophy of it I would like to understand ; he added. "That I can give you;' replied the hermit, 'the reason's plain. Man was not made for this world alone; hence, there is nothing on earth commensurate with the desires,--longings and aspirations of his soul; he must look beyond this. life to find a resting place for the immortal mind. Our hopes to be firm and un- fadipg, must be built above the stars; our joys to be pereneal, must flow from heaven; pleasures, not born to die, are only plucked from the flowery vales and rosy hills that bloom above the skies.' ".' It must be,' so answered the philosopher, 'as the sun pours light and warmth upon the earth, causing life and beauty to appear, so religion illuminates and vivifies the soul, producing the loveliness of virtue, and the beauty of holiness. And as a cloud darkens the sky, so impiety shrouds the mind in gloom.' "'Make the world religious, and you will make all men happy.' ' 'But do you never doubt, my venerable friend, the reality of the Christian religion ' "How can I doubt so great a truth?-a truth no less palpable than the noon-day sun! As well may I doubt the existence of God. If there be a God of in- finite power, wisdom and goodness, which all nature proclaims, 'tis not reasonable that he would leave man burdened with a thousand afflictions, without a solace; and walking in the dark valley and shadow of death,   TmE GREAT REVIV.       .1 without a light to guide his feet, or a hope extending beyond the grave. Besides, the influence of religion on the heart, carries with it ample evidence of its divinity.' "'I think you are right, sir; yet while for yeas I have been attempting to regenerate France, and make all classes happy, I've not been as fully persuaded -of the veracity of the Bible and the truth of the Chritian religion as I could have wished.' "Little wonder then, that you failed to accomplish your praiseworthy object.' "'So I now think; I have learned a great lesson from you.' ' And am I then instrumental of some good, while I stand trembling o'er the grave, in thisdeepsolitude.' "'Ay, my old friend, you have enlightened one, who has consumed years, and spent his thousands in a fruitless endeavor to lead his fellow men into the path of happiness. From the hint you've given me, the light of an infinite truth has suddenly flashed upon my mind.' "'There is a happiness in doing good; the pleasure I already feel, is an ample reward.' " I have now only to regret, that upon this subject I1l find the people of France less inclined to listen to me, than on any other. When I proposed to lessen the amount of their toil, and increase the wealth of the country, they lent an attentive ear: when I proposed to improve and multiply educational institutions:, they were still willing to hear'and approbate my plans;, but    <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC5840-00000149"/> 9Z      THET AsGRAT REVIVAL. when I shall recommend religion, and talk to them about eternal salvation, I fear they'll turn a heavy ear.' "'Ah, I daresay; for men are strangely perverse, and much less inclined to seek the kingdom of hea- ven, than they are the short-lived pleasures of earth.' 4 When the philosopher was about to take leave of the hermit, he offered him several pieces of gold:- 'What use haveI for money ' said the old man, 'where and with whom shall I spend it? I have sufficient food and raiment; my little garden yields me plenty to eat; and as for clothing I need no more than what I have. Money may be of use to you, but it can be none to me; for I cannot go to hunt up the poor and needy; I'm too old and frail.' "'But my friend, who will close your eyes when life's sun is set ' "'Ah, I trust providence will put it into the heart of some Christian to come and do that act of kindness; if it should be otherwise, my humble bed will be my grave.  "At this, the philosopher wept, and said: 'I can- not leave you thus to die alone; no, no, you must go with me; I have too, an humble dwelling; and will take pleasure in making you comfortable during your remaining days, and when they are numbered, give you a Christian burial.' "The old man now bowed his head and wept. Af- ter some further persuasion he yielded consent; and on the following day the philosopher brought a carriage, and conveyed the heriit to his own rural home, where.

The above narrative was listened to by the infidel previously alluded to, with profound attention; and thereby he was lead to sober reflection upon the sub- ject of religion, and to the reading and study of the scriptures, which resulted in his happy conversion. And by means even more simple than the narrative just given, God seemed pleased day after day, to bring scores from darkness to light; and from the error of their way, to rejoice in the hope of eternal life. And still while I write, the good work. is yet in progress, goes on gloriously, and with constantly increasing interest. The revival spirit, like a bright wave of sparkling and refreshing waters, sweeps widely o'er the land, pu- rifying and regenerating all hearts that yield to its be- nign and saving influence. There is -moral grandeur in the work ; the minds of men letting go the dull and empty objects of earth, are grasping the brighter and more enduring treasures of the skies. The golden chain of redeeming love seems to encircle the earth; and the Christian religion, like a mighty fulcrum and lever, is raising the moral world from the confines of darkness and perdition, to the sun-light and neighbor- hood of heaven.    <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5840-00000150"/> CONCLUS ION, I've' built a vinery, 'and planted a vineyard and now I turn ro-und- a moment to survey the field, and conft template what I have wrought.

After this herculean task- w"m over, then came the tedious work of training the brsiiih- ing vines that spread out in-uumberless ramifications, and of teaching the tendrils to cling to the vinery.

Turning about, I perceived that the individual who addressed me, was an eminent and experienced phy- sician. '"I'm sure doctor," said I, "this black and thorny tree, can yield nothing delicious." "True," replied the doctor, "but it will physic,- and that is sometimes as necessary as nourishment." So taking his advice, I let it stand. The last thing planted in the vineyard is called,- Light from Heaven. This is a slender vine of vari- ous branches; but I cherish the hope it may bring forth choice and wholesome fruit. After I had completed my work, and laid aside my watering pot, pruning-hook, and other implements, I laid me down under the shadow of a vine to rest; so arduous and constant had been my toil, and so grate- fal and soothing was the delicious shade and cool even- ing breeze, that I soon fell asleep and began to dream. Methought I was approached by one who called him- self a critic; his appearance was by no means pre- possessing; he had a little round, puckered mouth, his eyes were small, his nose sharp as a knife, and his forehead, though not very low, was beefy. He addressed me in a whining, piping voice, which was so offensive to my ear, that I felt greatly annoyed. After a good deal of flummery and wonderful profes- sions of friendship, he asked the privilege of walking   CONCLUSION,        5y through my vineyard,-hinting at the 8ame time, that for a small amount he could be of vast adcrantage:.to me by way of puffing.. My reply was, that I wanted, but a fair and candid expression of an enlightened pub- lic opinion, touching what I had produced; and aa money generally put bad spectacles on the eyes of critics, I'd made up my mind to let them go unpaid. At this, his little mouth put on a very peculiar pucker, and come together like the lips of a reticule, when its strings are brought up with a jerk. H-e now stood for a space, seemingly wrapped in silent medita- tion ; then suddenly collecting himself, and making an effort to look wise, he insisted upon going in at all events. I granted his request; and opening the gate, bade him enter. "Well, well," he exclaimed, directly after passing through the gate-way, " what on earth grows there?" "An Allegory,"I replied. "A strange looking thing ;" he observed, curling his lip, " and I defy any one to guess what it's intended; for; or whether it will bring forth grapes or acorns, or something worse than either. At any rate I don't like its odor--it-smells of the lamp." "Little wonder if it should," was my reply, "fQr born to hard fortune, I'm compelled to work by lamp- light as well as day-light." Going on a little further, he suddenly paused, and. lifting his cane, pointed, with a cynic sneer to a bunch of grapes on my largest vine, saying--"What little shrivelled, sour-looking things!'-  k     <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5840-00000152"/> gAs, L    CONCLUSION. "Ah," said I, but you don't seem to see them fine, large, plump clusters that grow all round the puny things you point to. This vine is called-TLhe Way the World Goes;- and your criticism is in keeping with its name. The world has an evil eye, and can always more easily see imperfections, than beauties and excellencies. You, like the world, come not to behold what is good, and award my toil the just meed of praise, but to seek out and magnify faults, that you may gratify a censorious disposition, and appear wise in the estimation of the unthinking multitude." With a satirical smirk he turned away and passed on to the next. "Ha! ha! there's too much foliage here; I see nothing but leaves." "Only because you look for nothing else ;"I answer- ed indignantly. "Lift them leaves with your cane and you'll see underneath them something delicious." "Andwhat an oddly constructed vinery! this frame- work has no just proportions; it reminds me of a wind-mill, and but for the vines that cover its deformi- ties, it would answer admirably for a scare-crow. Why didn't you build it exactly square, or else perfectly round 2" "That was not to my taste: there is nothing square in nature,-nor is there anything perfectly round on all sides." "At least you might have built it in straight lines." "But remember, nature abhors straight lines; she prefers the graceful curve, the undulating and wavy."   CoNcLUSION. .29 Well, there's one thing I'll predict, you'll see plenty of sap-suckers about here by-and-by." "I doubt it not; for the most beautiful and fruitful vines generally have rotten places enough for such mis- chievous birds to peck at. The reason is, in growing them, minor defects are overlooked, in the loftier aim of perfecting the fruit, giving it flavor, and rendering it wholesome. Sap-suckers are a species of critics that subsist on mean insects, worms, and such like things, that generate in unsound substances. To find a loathsome horn-bug in some ugly crevice, or under a bit of scaly bark, they'll pass by the ripest and best firuit.-                . "You intend no insinuations, I flatter myself?" said the critic winking his weazel eyes, as if I'd thrown sand in them, and again puckering up his little round mouth. To conceal his agitation, he commencedspit- ting as as if he'd unwittingly swallowed poison, and kept up the fire for quite a length of time,-and every time he spat, threw up his arms, and pitched his muz- zle forward with as much violence, as if trying to ex- pectorate from the bottom of his boots. While I was meditating how to make a suitable reply, a new thought seemed to strike him, and all at once, changing his tune, he began lavishing upon my vineyard a fulsome and sickly praise, which to my ear proved ten-fold more offensive, distasteful and unbearable than was his censure. At this, methought, I lost all patience, and giving way to my burning indignation, turned Turk upon the insolent fellow, and straightway booted \    <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC5840-00000153"/> O0        CONCLUSION. -him out of my vineyard. The excitement of the ope- ration, broke my slumbers, and I awoke convulsed with laughter at the ludicrous scene painted upon my imagination. I am about to lay down my pen, and it may be for- ever and aye. With much anxiety, and no little rack- ing ransacking of the brain, have I written this book; and now with the utmost solicitude, cast it upon the waves of an ebbing and flowing public mind,-where subjected to the capricious and uncertain ordeal of pub- lic opinion, it must sink or swim as that decrees. Be it just or unjust, I must needs abide the decision. -Should the mighty tribunal of the public mind, doom :the work to obscurity, 'll not repine, but try it again.
