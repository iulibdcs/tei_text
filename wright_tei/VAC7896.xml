NEW YORK  LIVERMORE &amp; RUDD, No. 310 BROADWAY. 1856.  &#xD;<pb n="" xml:id="VAC7896-00000002"/> INTRODUCTION.   WE have all strolled in a flower-garden in October, at noon-time, when the vertical sun-rays infused a modicum of life into plants, benumbed and blighted by the autumn chills. The wilted corollas exhale, with their dying breath, a perfume; pungent, aromatic, and more grateful to the nostrils, than the redolence that clings around Persian vases, or the odorous unguents- of Poppoea's toilet. The paths strewn with variegated leaves; the torn petals, scattered seeds, and broken twigs, recall the tristful thought that summer is past: so, do" the memories of yesterday's joys and yesterday's loves, bring a pleasurable sadness to the heart, and the drudging chronicler tastes anew, delights in which he has participated, or mourns again, sorrows he has shared. To be candid, the scribe is at the confessional, though, with the kind permission of an indulgent pub- lic, he will wear the vizard. The title of this, our veritable history, may, at first      &#xD;<pb n="iv-v" xml:id="VAC7896-00000003"/> iV         INTRODUCTION. glance, seem a misnomer, relating, as it does, the career of the family of the late lamented Silas Page, Esquire. If we have chosen to ignore that gentle- man's name, it is, we beg to observe, without intention of slighting his cherished memory, but solely by reason of the overpowering pressure of his distinguished widow's claims. Moreover, as will be perceived on perusal of this narrative, the Pageian achievements and influences were comparatively insignificant, while birth, connections, position in society, and other desir- able accessories of life, were entirely on the lady's side. We have, therefore, in contradistinction to the reprehensible custom which sinks a woman's maiden name, however famous it may be, into that of her husband, however obscure, his may be, deemed it but due to Widow Page, to grace this chronicle with her illustrious patronymic. We are also strength- ened in this intent from the fact, that she has often assured. us, confidentially, that Mr. Page's mental acquirements and tastes were totally inadequate to support her in the position she was entitled to. To use her own words-"It is certainly useless to disguise it, I married beneath me; I must confess it to have been a marriage of interest. I was young and giddy. Poor papa had lost the greater part of his immense fortune by endorsing notes to oblige friends, and left mammna in somewhat limited circumstances, I was,   INTRODUCTION.        V therefore, sacrificed-though,-there can be no impro- priety in mentioning it at this time-a distinguished statesman, who has since occupied the Presidential chair, was rejected by mamma, through preference for Mr. Page. Still, I cannot say I have had any great cause to regret it. Mr. Page certainly was, a very at- tentive husband, and kind and affectionate father, though, at times, eccentric-very." To sum all, we design it, also, as a slight acknow- ledgment of kindnesses received, from Mrs. Page; of the many times our unworthy knees have reposed be- neath her hospitable mahogany--or rather oak; and of the dainties eaten, and numberless magnums of choice grape-blood quaffed, from the surface thereof. Not that we have been influenced in our duty as im- partial historians by the remembrances of these favors bestowed; for we are inflexible, rigid, and, unlike those compared by Pascal to un roseau peint en fer-a reed painted as iron-unswayed by Zephyrs, unbent by Boreas. With these prefatory observations we present our scroll.   &#xD;<pb n="vi-vii (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7896-00000004"/> rf - I    CONTENTS, CHAPTER                  PAGO I.

IT is now some five and fifty years ago, be the same more or less--as the deeds say-since Silas, son of Asaph Page, left his native village for Manhattan Island. Had we been present at the time, and pos- sessed of unimpaired optics, we might, doubtless, have seen the adventurous lad boldly clutch his slender bundle, and, with buoyant foot, step on board the good sloop, Betsy of Coxsackie. After a- passage of remarkable brevity and freedom from the perils of the treacherous element, the gallant craft bumped her bluff bows at a wharf, situated near the present intersection of-Rector and Greenwich streets. Silas went ashore, and wandered about the vast town in quest of employment. For several days his efforts were ineffectual, and he returned each night for shelter beneath the hospitable 1l  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7896-00000006"/> 10   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. deck of the old sloop. At last, the fates were pro- pitious, and he succeeded in obtaining work in the shop of a good-natured cordwainer. After a probational month, being mutually pleased, Silas was indentured to his employer, and commenced his career as a disciple of Saint Crispin. He faithfully served his time, and at its expiration, established himself. on his own ac- count, in Jacob street near Beekman's Swamp. By the simple exercise of thrift and industry, he soon accumulated an amount of money sufficient to enable him to enlarge his sphere of action, by embarking in the traffic of hides: tanned and untanned. Prosperity, who seldom deserts the frugal and diligent, again favored him, and ten years later found Silas Page the owner of the largest leather warehouse in the Swamp, and of several tanneries in the interior of the State. Still, Silas was npt contented. He had, to be sure, arisen from an humble country lad to the prominent position of a wealthy mer- chant in, the chief city of the Union; but he felt there was an undefined something neces-   ANTECEDENTS.      " sary to complete his happiness. Alexander sighed for other worlds to conquer, and why should our worthy citizen be less exacting of dame Fortune? He cudgelled his brains during his leisure moments-which were very lim- ited-to discover the desideratum, but unsuc- cessfully, and would probably have remained in ignorance of it to this day-had he lived so long-had not a lucky accident popped the idea in his head, leaving him bewildered by the momentous suggestions it awakened. In a word, Silas Page was a bachelor and Silas Page needed a home. Of course, a home included wife and children, peace and happi- ness. He succeeded in getting the wife and children, but whether the other comforts followed in train, we will not positively assert. It happened in this wise. At a social gather- ing to which Silas was invited (and he was invited to a great number of these) he met the celebrated belle, Miss Spuytenduyvel, whose multitudinous charms created an unusual im- pression on his mercantile mind. From this moment, abstraction and disquietude disturbed '  ,            /  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7896-00000007"/> 12   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. his methodicity; new and strange emotions possessed his being; and, after a calm, analyt- ical deliberation with himself, he came to the conclusion, that the cause of his unwonted perturbation was-the enchanting Miss Spuy- tenduyvel! The fact is, thought he, I must get married. Strange, I should never have thought of it before. Then, with grave consideration he weighed the advantages and disadvantages of a connubial existence; made all due allowances for incon- veniences; calculated the increased expendi- tures, the risks and chances ; struck a balance; and found the result, in a pecuniary point of view, extremely unsatisfactory. Silas shook his head, closed his mental ledger, and deter- mined with a vigorous will, to banish all ideas of a marriage contract from his mind. But alas! how vain and futile are such intentions. The very first thing he did, on reaching his apartment, was to take up and kiss a wilted flower that lay on his dressing-table-a gift from Miss Spuytenduyvel. The seraphic smile, with which she had fastened this little token to   ANTECEDENTS.      13 his button-hole on that evening, came vividly and sweetly to mind. His mercenary calcu- lations vanished like mnist before sunbeams, and he went to bed, indulging in rapturous visions of supernal bliss, in all of which Miss Spuy- tenduyvel bore the prominent part. A short time after he proposed for the hand of his fair- enslaver. He was accepted. The wedding, which came off subsequently, attracted consid- erable attention, as such an event could hardly fail to do. The bride, though poor in worldly goods, was rich in gentility; and a daughter of the good old Knickerbocker house of the Spuyten- duyvels was, according- to New Netherlands prejudices, a match for the wearer of a ducal coronet. It would hardly be worth while to invoke the bulky shade of Yan Yost Spuyten- duyvel, the founder of the family-the first of the name who set foot on the muddy flats of Communipaw-and relate all the exploits of that corpulent man. Suffice it to say, that by bartering glass beads with the Indians for mink and beaver skins, he amassed innumerable guilders, which his grandson Killian lost sub-  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7896-00000008"/> "   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. sequently, by an unfortunate speculation in sassafras bark. The decadence of the family dates from this' event, until we find Nicholas Spuytenduyvel-the father of Mrs. Silas Page --reduced to the inglorious post of customs gauger. A worthy, one-legged man, was he, kinsman of the Van Dams, Van Tassels, and Van Kortlandts, besides being a descendant and co-heir of the famous Anneke Janz. In the latter respect, indeed,- tradition runs that the old gentleman became a dreaded bore on the subject of his relationship with that lady, and made a nightly practice--while enjoying, with true Dutch gusto, his schnapps and pipe at Hotchkiss's tavern-of fulminating his philip- pics against "that remnant of a regal hie- rarchy," the Trinity Church corporation. One night, after indulging--during an excit- ing debate on the old topic--in an extra glass of fine flavored brandy, that " wouldn't stand much water," he sallied homeward, in a some- what befuddled state. While stumping past Lorillard's warehouse, he unfortunately fell down a newly-excavated cellar, thereby frac- turing his neck and wooden leg. He left a   ANTECEDENTS.      15 disconsolate widow, a handsome-daughter, and innumerable debts. The disconsolate widow managed, as we have related, to transform the handsome daughter into the wealthy Mrs. Page; then drying her tears, kindly consented to abide with the new- married couple, and bestow her mature wisdom on their family councils. Silas Page, whose lineage boasted no greater ancestor than a Tory army contractor, compen- sated by money his lack of patrician attributes, and, altogether, despite a disparity of age (the bride was seventeen-the groom forty),- the marriage was considered an advantageous one for both parties. Worldly-wise mothers said Maria Spuytenduyvel had made a great" catch." Various young ladies, who had vainly endea- vored to entrap the goldfinch, now declared they ".wouldn't have married the man fofrtwice his money." "Sour grapes!" said Maria; "I1 would rather be an old man's darling than a young-one's slave." Upon the whole, the bar- gain was a fair one. When a maid weds a man old enough to be her father, the inference drawn is, that she receives an adequate compensation  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7896-00000009"/> 16   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. for the sacrifice: and if the'bride had youth and beauty, had not the husband the where- withal to purchase them-? Now Silas entered on a new life. Mrs. Page was a dashy woman; ostentatious and showy. Being now enabled to gratify her propensities, she soon launched into all the fashionable eccentricities of the day. This conflicted sadly with her husband's peace and quietude. Her grand parties were always fearful ordeals to him. The poor man, uncomfortably encased in gloves and new clothes, took refuge in a re- tired corner, to chat on stock-market or cotton- crop with some fellow-merchant. The frequent tiffs between his wife and her mother were also causes of great annoyance, until the old lady left in high dudgeon, to reside with her brother, in Chenango, where she died shortly after, full of years, honors, and Maccaboy snuff. Luckily the birth of a son dissipated his nas- cent regrets, and he found, in parental affection, a holy, peaceful happiness, unknown before. The man's soul, though steeped in eager lusWt of lucre, needed but the application of iS  w     e   ANTECEDENTS.  '     17 nature's touchstone, to evolve a pure, bright ray. At his wife's instance, they removed from their home in Murray street. to a grander dwell- ing on Washington square. Mrs. Page grew exclusively genteel-hired a French maid from Alsace to dress hair, clear-starch, and teach the children French in its Parisian purity; and promoted the coachman to white cotton gloves, and a velvet band around his hat. Now, Silas was stigmatized by his envious and less fortunate friends as an " aristocrat." His corner neigh- bors, the Montagues, who cherished a mythical crest, having been inadvertently omitted from a ball of Mrs. P.'s, revenged themselves by calling him "parvee-noo," and repeated the old jest about there being "( nothing like lea- ther." Here let us moralize.  Wealth will excite envy, where talent or learning passes unnoticed. Who prizes a Humboldt's friend- ship? Yet, who among us delights not in the nod of recognition from yonder greasy citizen, that turtle-fed millionaire? Not that we mean a fling at the wealthy, and readily admit a manf is not necessarily a rascal  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7896-00000010"/> 18   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. because rich. In the genus Snob, we find two species, eminently contemptible. The one, fan- cy themselves moulded in finer clay, and thereby entitled to inflict insult on their fellow-man ; the other, a blatant crew, howl rancorously against those more fortunate, because, forsooth, their claims to friendship and fellowship are not recognized! The asinine arrogance of the first finds its only counterpoise in the spiteful venom of the other. Mrs. Page, as was natural-in a person so highly connected, felt a justifiable pride in her family, but Silas, on the contrary, boasted par- ticularly of being a self-made man-of having come into the city without a copper in his pocket, etc. He carried this feeling so far, in fact, as to have preserved his old cobbler's bench. It lay away in the garret, and when Arabella, his eldest daughter, " put on airs," as he called it, he would show her the bench, telling her to remember that her father 'was a shoemaker, and an honest man."  Such a proceeding was always viewed by his wife with undisguised horror, and she would have consigned this relic of his early occupations to   ANTECEDENTS. the flames, had she dared to. But on this point, Silas was strenuous, and the Spuyten- duyvel blood was obliged to submit. Another habit, he indulged in, was also high- ly distasteful to his good lady. His custom, on coming home from business, was to enter the house through the basement area. "I do wish, Mr. Page," the lady would say, with a little acerbity, "I do wish you would leave off that vulgar habit of coming in through the basement. One would think you were the baker or butcher. I noticed, as you came in, Sarah Montague and her mother, at their parlor window, laughing heartily-the Capulets have made remarks about it--the whole row has noticed it." "The Capulets, and 5Montagues, and the whole row, can go to the-the"--would Silas respond, irritated by his wife's import nacy. "Must I, to please the Capulets and AIonta- gues-must I, exhausted and tired by my daily labor, climb twelve steep stone steps, walk sixty feet of hall, down twenty other steps, and walk forty feet more to my supper- table, when I can get to it by a short cut of  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7896-00000011"/> 20   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. four steps? No, Mrs. Page, I'll not do it, not to please the whole world! I may be taken for a butcher or a pirate-it may be as vulgar as possible, I don't care. Isn't it enough that at every party you give, I must choke in stiff collars and cravats, squeeze my feet in small boots, and get a headache the next morning for my reward? Isn't that enough, I say, without requiring me to walk a quarter of a mile every evening to my tea-table? No," would Silas add, relentingly, as Mrs. P. show- ed signs of an approaching shower, " if you'll set the table in the front parlor, I'll-I'll- compromise. I'll sacrifice myself so far as to climb the stoop-not without." Of 'course, Mrs. Page would bewail the fate that linked her to such a husband, and wish, amid her sobs, that her dear mamma were alive to shield her from his brutality. As the weeping lady approached the hysterical stage, Silas would quickly leave the room, which en- tirely obviated the necessity of the servants resorting to the customary restoratives. True, Silas Page was a parvenu. That is to say, he had acquired his money by his own in-   ANTECEDENTS.       21 dustry, and was not indebted for his fortune, to the luck or shame of some unscrupulous ances- tor. Why the term parvenu should, in this repub- lican country, be twisted or misconstrued into one of opprobrium, is difficult to conceive. It should be eagerly desired by all, and respected as such, when the possessor has honorably ac- quired it, and- Faith! it is sought for eager- ly enough. Let parvenus flourish and multiply good people, our turn may come some day. Still Silas's wealth increased, and his money- bags waxed plethoric.  But, unfortunately, while accumulating riches, he lost his health. Shilling dinners, at cheap restaurants, swallow- ed at irregular hours, and often, in the hurry of business, skipped altogether, brought on the national disease; dyspepsia. After being be- drugged and be-physicked, as is usual in such cases, without the slightest beneficial effect, he was compelled to resign his business, and be- take himself to a country life. He bought an estate in Westchester, lying at the entrance of the Sound, and commenced to erect a country seat.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7896-00000012"/> 22   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "What shall we name the house, dear?" said Mrs. P. to her spouse. "Name the house! why I'm not building a tavern nor a hotel." "Pshaw! I mean, how shall we designate the place? How is it to be known?" "Why, I can put a neat door-plate on the gate"- "Mr. Page, you talk like a simpleton. You know very well, it is customary for every gen- tleman to have some name for his estate." "Very well, Mrs. Page, have it your own way-anything for a quiet life. Do as you please." So the place was christened Aiglemnont-a name she had discovered in a favorite novel, "The Mashed Heart"--Aiglemont being the baronial hall of Reginald de Tourbillion, the husband and " masher" of the aforesaid heart. During the progress of the work, the super- intendence it required, the open air exercise and regular meals, induced a better state of health; but at its completion, when there remained nothing to occupy his mind, he relapsed into his former hypochondriacal condi-   ANTECEDENTS.      23 tion. One morning, the gardener found him in the barn, in a gloomy, dejected mood, and with a razor in his pocket; after which, he was hurried to town, and permitted again to min- gle in the activity of business. This affording but partial improvement, he dismissed his family physician, and resigned himself to the whole round of empiricism and quackery. For several years he lingered, suffering the tortures of monomaniacal dyspepsia, until dis- ease proved the conqueror, and he fell victim to an abuse, that kills off more Americans than King Cholera;--a neglected stomach. Common sense and shrewdness, were old Silas's chief characteristics ; love of money, and love for his children, his two passions. Those graphic delineators who depict the American merchant as a stupid blockhead, exhibiting an ignorance deplorable in a shoe-black, would have found a different type in Silas Page. He was, to be sure, an unlettered man, unable to descant on the beauties of a Cellini vase, or to quote Horace; but those who would have es- sayed to make him a butt for ridicule, would have been readily undeceived; and had they  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7896-00000013"/> 24   THE SPUYtr'NDUYVEL CHRONICLE. wished to pursue their investigations, and at- tempt to over-reach him, would most likely have realized the fable of the shearer who came back shorn.   CHAPTER II. BROCKHOLST ROOSEVELT AND SAMUEL HYSON. SILAS PAGE was dead. The Chamber of Commerce convened, passed obituary resolutions expressive of their regret, and resolved to'attend his funeral in a body. The corpse was taken to Greenwood, and inter- red in the family vault. Then the "last will and testament" was examined. The property was found devised to the children, reserving, of course, the dower right to the widow. The executorship was intrusted to one Mr. Roosevelt, a distant relative of the deceased, and Samuel Hyson, of the firm of Hyson &amp; Co., opulent commission merchants. Brockholst Roosevelt was a rich old bache- lor-a model bachelor; ruddy, solid, healthy, and happy, a gentleman of urbane manners, and refined tastes.

He was a good specimen of an American gentleman; of one in whom'the na- tional vanity had been eliminated by travel, and the national uncouthness polished by polite intercourse. Often, at noon, you met him in Wall street, primly dressed, -neatly gloved and cravatted, wearing the inseparable gold-headed Malacca, and discussing monetary matters with some acquaintance. He was ardently devoted to the art piscatory, and loved fishing as he de- tested politics. Every spring found him whip- ping the trout-streams of Long Island; every summer trolling for blue fish in Naragansett's Bay, and every autumn bassing at Hell Gate. Mrs. Page held him in great deference. He in- terested himself principally in the children's welfare and education, while the other trustee, Mr. Hyson, took entire charge of the estate. This latter gentleman was one of that class whom society pronounces 9" eminently respecta- ble," i. e. he wore a white neck-cloth, was el- -der in Dr. Context's church, and a director of   BROCKHOLST ROOSEVELT AND SAMUEL IIYSON. 27 the Tract Society. You seldom saw a list of contributions for some worthy purpose without finding his name inscribed thereon as a donor. His enemies taxed him with hypocrisy--his clerks and dependents styled him a miserly. tyrant. Yet it is doubtful if the former charge could justly be laid against him, there being but few hypocrites in the strict sense of the term. And, though some of the means whereby he had accumulated wealth, would not bear the test' of consistency with his professions, still, these, he argued, were business matters, entirely dis- connected with his conduct in a private and in- dividual capacity. He had, for instance; though a strong aboli- tionist, caused some slaves to be sold at Savan- nah to satisfy a judgment obtained against a Southern debtor; again, he had realized a snug sum by inducing some mechanics to build on unimproved lands of his in Brooklyn, and then, taking advantage of their reverses, foreclosed the mortgages and purchased their homes for a mere song. This latter transaction a severe moralist might condemn, as bordering on the dishonest, nevertheless old Hyson felt that he  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7896-00000015"/> 28   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. had been keeping strictly within legal bounds, and even considered the act commendable as evincing shrewd business talent. ' Do others, or they will do you," is an axiom with many of our commercial men. To lie, cheat, and take advantage of your neighbor's credulity, or ignorance, is not knavish, but, on the contrary, smart, keen, and clever. The individual who can most grossly shave (a nice term for cheat) a customer, finds in it the sub- ject for a good joke. He gains the reputation of a sharp practitioner, while his dupe is laughed at for a simpleton and fool. And yet, these men would hesitate to commit petty larceny; would recoil from shop-lifting: not so much from dread of the law, but because they are slightly obtuse on ethical points, and fear to put themselves beyond the pale of re- spectability. Mr. Hyson, we are certain, would never have picked your pocket, yet he would not have hesitated to foist upon you damaged Twankay for first-chop Pekoe; or again, he could not have been induced to take a hand at whist, such was his abhorrence of gaming, but in a fair speculation, like blowing up a   BROCKHOLST ROOSEVELT AND SAMUEL HYSON. 29 bubble stock to par, he would gladly have seized the opportunity of turning an honest penny. He is a keen casuist, by-the-by, who 'can discriminate between speculation and gambling; between the roulette table and the stock-board. As we remarked, there are but few hypo- crites in the strict sense of the term-few who feel they are but dissemblers-few who know, ingly, counterfeit virtue. Those generally styled hypocrites are such as, Butler says, "Compound for sins they are inclin'd to, By damning those they have no mind to." Hyson was one of these. He knew his imper- fections. 'He was aware that certain transac- tions of his would not bear the test of probity, still, he readily soothed his rebellious conscience by the truism, that "No man is perfect" and that he had amply amended his errors by strict attendance at worship; munificent charitable gifts; and a stern, severe, opposition to the vices he had no mind to. Few of us are not actuated in the same way.

To sustain his position in society, Mr. Hy- son found it incumbent to live in a fashionable neighborhood, to keep a carriage and liveried lackeys.

Towards evening, we notice on the piazza of the "States," a lady and a gentleman walking leisurely to and fro. The lady (between ourselves), we should say, was forty-three or so. The gentleman about the same age. The lady is attired in semi- mourning, tastily arranged, and bears about her sharp features the traces of faded beauty. There is a shade of haughtiness on her counte- nance, scarcely perceptible, however, at the present moment, as she seems disposed to be affable to her companion. The latter, who is holding his hat behind his back, we have no difficulty in recognizing as an Englishman. The unmistakable Britannic whisker, the fleshy cheek, the collar and cravat, betray him at once. Joviality radiates from his smug face, and his humid eye, shot with engorged veins, betokens an inordinate love for dinner and drink. This is the Hon. Captain Frederick Rackett, a scion of the English nobility, who visits this country to bag grizzly bears and canvas-back ducks. The lady is Mrs. Spuytenduyvel Page. She speaks--"I don't know why, exactly,   SIX YEARS AFTER.     35 but, really, Captain, I feel an irresistible incli- nation to ask you how you like our country?" "Aw, madam," answered the Captain, pull- ing up his shirt collar, "I hardly dare express an opinion, but, upon my word, I must say, I haven't tasted a good beefsteak, or bottle of port, since I have been in it." "O no, Captain; I dont mean that. I merely wish to know what are your impressions in re- gard to our form of government, of its justice and liberality; in fact-what do you think of our republican institutions?" "Hem-I dessay the institutions and all that sort o' thing are very fine," returned the Cap- tain; " but, I find a want of a-um-dignity, grandeur, that will prevent this nation from ever rising to any eminence. You should have a nobility here, to uphold your rank. You should, indeed." "We have something of the kind," rejoined Mrs. Page, quickly; "our best families, you will find, exert a controlling influence, and add respectability to the opinions of the lower classes. For, some among us, Captain, can lay claim to gentle blood; indeed, among the  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7896-00000019"/> 36   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Cavaliers of Virginia, and the Knickerbockers of this State, you can find many who trace their ancestry to names famous even in Euro- pean annals." Mrs. Page was about to dilate on the fame and greatness of the Spuytenduyvel family, and explain how a collateral branch of the house was descended from the Dukes of Courland, when she was interrupted by the appearance of two young ladies. The Captain, seemingly much relieved by this interruption, bowed, grinned sweetly, and extended a thickly-stuffed glove towards them. The taller one, a handsome, blooming girl, inclined her head, without accepting the prof- ered hand. It was Amy Page. The other, Miss Fanny Hyson, said with a mincing air of offended dignity: "I don't think you are at all gallant, Captain ; I have been waiting for you at least half an hour." "I beg your pardon, I wasn't aware of it, 'pon my honor," said the Captain; '"Mrs. Page and I were talking politics-discessing national questions." "Politics!" cried Fanny, casting up her eyes   SIX, YEARS AFTER.    37 in mock astonishment, "I hardly believe it; I should hope you had better taste." "I am certainly excusable, as Mrs. Page broached the subject," answered the Captain. "What! Mrs. Page talk politics!" repeated F'anny. "Impossible! I believe you were flirting."  "Ho! ho! ho!" roared the Captain. "Fanny, my dear," said Mrs. Page, reprov- ingly. Fanny was a fast girl, an espiegle, and permitted herself many things that other peo- ple dared not attempt. "Well, and why not?" she continued. "It isn't a crime, is it? People do such things, don't they?" "Do you speak from experience-?" inquired the Captain. "What an inquisitive man you are!"  "Do you notice how I am traduced?" said the Captain, appealing to Amy Page. "I fan- cy Miss Page would not judge me so harshy; by'-he-by, I have not had the pleasure of see- ing you in several days; you have kept your- -self somewhat secluded, have you not?" U"My sister has been unwell, and I have been  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7896-00000020"/> 38   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. obliged to devote my time to her," answered Miss Page. "I admire your sisterly affection," gallantly spoke the Captain; "I hope Miss Arabella is better."' "Somewhat improved, thank you," said Miss Page. "She ventured to descend to the parlor, this evening." "O, indeed! I must pay my respects to her," said the Captain. They entered the drawing-room. Arabella, Mrs. Page's eldest daughter, bore a remarkable resemblance to her mother. The same sharp features, and cold black eyes; the same expression of disdain and stylish arro- gance, tamed, however, by the shadow  of physical suffering; for she had received in infancy a hip-injury, that crippled her for life. The waxen countenance and blue segments beneath her eyes, betrayed the insidious disease that preyed on her vitality. "Miss Page," said the Captain, bowing, "your most obedient." Arabella acknowledged his presence with a smile.   SIX YEARS AFTER.     39 "I am delighted to find you have recovered sufficiently to gladden our eyes with your presence, and illumine our souls with your sunbeam smiles," continued he. Arabella illumined his soul by another smile. At this moment a young man joined them-a thin, light-built youth, with a consequential, jaunty expression on his pale face. "O, Alf.!" exclaimed Miss Fanny Hyson, ,where have you been? I thought you in- tended to walk with us." "Can't help it-couldn't come-been down to the lake with a lot of fellers-had a game dinner, and all that. There!" said he, as the lively strains of Dunker's band came merrily on the ear, "the hop's going to begin- come." They went among the dancers. Alf. clasped the vivacious Fanny, and whirled her in the mazes of the polka-redowa. "Miss Page, may I have the honor?" said the Captain. "Excuse me, if you please; I do not wish to dance this evening," -answered Amy. "Amy, my dear, do dance; I love to see  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7896-00000021"/> 40   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. you," said her mother, with the slightest con- traction of the brows. "Please do-do be kind enough," entreated the Captain. Thus pressed, Amy could not refuse. Near the entrance of the room stood two individuals, gazing at the dancers. One was an aged man, wrapped, though it was midsum- mer, in a voluminous blue cloak. The other, a young man, slight, consumptive-looking, 'and with coal black hair and eyes. They were evidently Cubans. The younger one raised an eye-glass, stared at Amy, and, turning to his companion, said: "i Que'muchacha tan linda!" The music ceased.' Fanny, panting and tired, seated herself. "Alf., do look at that pretty fellow," said she to her partner. "What pretty fellow?" inquired Alf., sav- agely. "That young fellow by the door, with the black moustache, and sweet pensive eyes." "That Spaniard, do you mean? Do you call him pretty?" returned Alf., with a disgusted   SIX YEARS AFTER.     41 air. (Alf. had neither moustache, nor pensive eyes)   . "O, pshaw! you're so jealous." "Jealous! Hoh! hoh! hoh! Ha! ha! ha!" said Alf., with a melo-dramatic laugh. "Jeal- ous-ha! that's pretty good-come-and of such a monkey as that, too; hoh! oh! (sar- donically). But come, Fan, this is a mazurka." Alfred Dilly and Fanny Hyson were reputed excellent dancers, and as they treaded the mea- sure of that most graceful of dances-the ma- zurka-the assembled eyes were upon them. Fanny was barely sixteen.. In height, no taller than "'the statue. that enchants the world," face pretty, white skin, and dancing blue eyes. Her low cut dress displayed bewil- dering shoulders, and her brown hair, puffed at each temple, added piquancy to the arch features., As they neared the door, wheretstood the Cubans, Fanny, accidentally or otherwise, dropped her handkerchief.' The young Cuban perceiving this, picked it up, and, at the con- clusion of the dance, came forward with Cas- tilian grace, to return it.  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7896-00000022"/> 42   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "Your handkerchief, Miss, I believe," said he, speaking broken English. "Thank you," replied Fanny, and she darted a glance from her roguish eyes that would have caused St. Anthony to shake in his sandals. Alf. assumed a ferocious air, and the Cuban retired. Captain Rackett with Mrs. Page and her daughter now came up. "Really, Miss Hyson, I must compliment you on your dancing," said the courtly warrior. "It's absolutely fascinating." Fanny laughed, showing her teeth. " O it's so warm here. Come, Alf., do let us go on the piazza."  She slyly removed a flower from her hair, and, when brushing past the Cuban, dropped it at his feet, playing her eyes at him, meanwhile, like a prism. The young man. picked it up, and, unper- ceived, save by Fanny, pressed it to his lips. Permit us to shift the scene adrd introduce you to another member of the Page family. Within a mile of the United States Hotel, was a small building, containing bar, billiard saloon  and pistol gallery. At the end of the- billiard saloon, you found a stair-way   SIX YEARS AFTER.       43 and passage leading to a wing of the building, where the green table flourished. On the evening, in which the incidents we have just related occurred, a party were con- gregrated in this room, engaged in the ingenious and instructive game of faro. For various reasons, the company deserves a particularization. At the centre of the table, sat a man with his coat off, dealing the deck.*  He wore a flat-rimmed hat, covering his close-cropped hair and beardless face. A dropping of the lids at the corners, gave his eyes a covert, malignant look, and his battered features bore no small similitude to a Calmuck's. His torso was Sam- sonic, and his neck, the great point of strength, of Doric massiveness. This was Tom Rock, shoulder-hitter, election broker, emigrant run- ner, etc., etc. By his side, resting on a sword- cane, stood a sallow-faced man with tufted * Our sporting gentry are Shakesperian-- Vide King Henry VI., part third.

He was a Southern black-leg, graduate of "Natchez under the bluff," and hero of many a Vicksburgh brawl. Cockney caricaturists, who generally rep- resent a Yankee as sitting in a rocker, long- nine in mouth, sherry cobbler in hand, and a waist-belt full of revolvers and Arkansas tooth- picks, would probably have taken him as a fair specimen of American gentler'en.* ,- Across the table stood two individuals especi- ally note-worthy. - One, a tall handsome man of betweeri thirty-five and forty years, was ele- gantly dressed, even a dash of danidyism was per- ceptible in the embroidered shirt-front fastened by small diamond    buttons, and the Madras cravat tied d la Brimmell. .The other, a young- er man flashily attired, betrayed  in his once comely face, the terrible inroads of dissipation.

The first of these gentlemen was Mr. Rich- ard Jeffers, or Dick Jeffers in common, parlance, the keeper of the most fashionable gaming- house in New York city, who, business being dull in the metropolis, was enjoying elegant leisure, and plucking a chance gull at the Springs. The other gentleman was Mrs. Page's son, Edgar Spuytenduyvel Page. The residue of the Company consisted of a little red whiskered "jock," who had a b. m. entered for the morrow's trot, and a few sprigs of our " first families" who were thus killing time, while their anxious parents were enjoy- ing themselves in happy unconsciousness of their sons' whereabouts. The game proceeded with varied success. Jeffers took no part in it, but was observ- ing Edgar with some interest.  It appear- ed also, from a remark of his, that he wished to dissuade him from playing.  Tom Rock, perceiving this, could hardly conceal his dis- pleasure. 1, ,   &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7896-00000024"/> "   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Edgar had lost a considerable sum, when, at a turn in the game, the Southerner quietly offered him a side-bet of twenty-five or fifty dollars on the next card. 1"None o' that," said Tom Rock. "Just for a flyer," said the Southerner. "I'll take it," said Edgar. Neither party, however, posted the stakes. The card was dealt, and the Southerner won., "I'll take that fifty, if you please," said he. "What fifty?" said Edgar doggedly. "That fifty you lost," responded the other. "What do you mean?" returned Edgar. "Pint up-on the square. You know you lost,." said the Southerner. "You lie," said Edgar defiantly. "What!" yelled the other. "For two pins I'd toss you--sudden! You blasted swindler," swaggered Edgar, attempt- ing to pull off his coat. "Come, come, no bounce," growled Rock. Whizz-crash! The Southerner, taking a tumbler that lay on the side-board, hurled it,   SIX YEARS AFTER. leveling the best blood of all the Spuyten- duyvels. -"Be quiet! no fighting," roared Rock, who, to restore order, shot out an arm, muscular as Milo's, that, catching the Southerner at the eye, made the lost Pleiad dance before his astonished vision. Jeffers raised Edgar. Find- ing him stunned and helpless, he coolly let him drop. The glass, shivering on his forehead, had inflicted a contusion and a cut. Brandy was then poured down his throat, the blood wiped from the wound, and ice applied to his head. During the confusion, the Southerner, under the impression that he had killed his antagonist, decamped. Edgar, revived by the stimulants, was lugged * along by Jeffers and two others to the hotel. They smuggled him into his room, a physician was sent for, and the report spread that he had fallen from horseback. Mrs. Page and Amy were in great consterna- tion, and Amy passed the night by her brother's bedside.  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7896-00000025"/> 48   THE SPUIY'TINDUVEJL CHRONICLE. "Another conquest," thought Miss Fanny Hyson when laying down to sleep. "I'll have swch a delightful flirtation." "I flatter myself I've made an impression," soliloquized the Captain-in the solitude of his chamber, as he' stood before a mirror smirking and brushing vigorously at his russet whiskers. "Hem-we shall see." Alf.

Just as he set about picking a second-joint of the individual, he awoke from the blissful illu- sion to stern reality.   CIIAPTER IV. AMY AND ARABELLA PAGE. MRS. PAGE was, as before intimated, a very aristocratic lady. Not exactly as that term is understood in this community, where every person that keeps carriage is an aristocrat, but we mean, she entertained a profound deference for birth and blood. And though she could lay some claim to these advantages, by reason of her Knickerbocker origin, still, she secretly felt her pride pale before the splendors of titled rank. The English nobility in particu- lar, were the objects of her intense admiration, and in good sooth, German barons and French counts, are at a great discount heie. The beg- garly crew find small favor in our republican eyes. They even stand in better odor in Eng- land, where titles of any description command 3-  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7896-00000026"/> 50   TIIE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. a premium. -But in this, our country, pinch- beck pedigrees will not pass current. Even the Duke of Hesse-Schnapplewitz, with his ninety-nine quarterings, would hardly elicit a passing remark in our happy land; and, for the simple reason, that one of our bullion barons could buy him, his duchy, corporal's guard, and all. He may be very well in Iis way, but we know how to appreciate true nobility and worth. Gilt is not to be palmecld on us for g old, nor blazonry for broad pieces. But your English noblemen--your Percys and Grosvenors-with their thousand pounds income a day, are altogether different affairs. We are ready to render theim the homage due their illustrious rcank and wealth, and with good reason, for after all, what are these mag- nificos in. spite of Battle Abbey and Burke's Peerage, unless backed by coal mines or con- sols? No more than we, worthy reader; let us console ourselves with this cheering reflec- tion. And we verily believe, that were the best blood of all the Howards to go a-begging, he could gather no more coppers than the meanest tatterdemalion of them all.   AMY AND ARABELLA PAGE.    51 When Mrs. Page met the Honorable Captain Rackett, a younger son, it was reported, of the Earl of Fitz-Barbacan, you may rest assured her ladyship was in high feather, and took im- mediate measures to monopolize him. Sensible was she to the advantages of securing such a lion for her soirees, and, perhaps, entertained she also, some ulterior designs connected with her daughter's welfare. This latter hypothesis seeming the more probable, when we notice how she constantly impressed the Captain's at- tentions upon Amy. Several days after the accident which had befallen Edgar, Mrs. Page and her two daugh- ters were in their apartment. The French maid, Adele, had just dressed her mistress's hair and left the room. Arabella sat in a Turkish chair, reading. Though it was early, this lady was attired with consummate splendor. Her robe was of showy silk, her slim transparent throat nestled in point lace, fastened by bril- liants-diamonds hung in her ears, and her thin, vein-laced hands, were loaded with rings. The mockery was complete.   That wasted pain-racked body betrothed to the worms, be-  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7896-00000027"/> 52   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. dizened, alas, in sumptuous garments. As if to smother the devouring disease beneath this outward gaudery. By the window sat Amy, sewing.  If she appeared beautiful amid the shadows and facti- tious lights of evening, how transcendently so, was she, in the glare of day. Hers was not that artificial, ball-room beauty, that fades to phantom ghastliness in the sunlight, but the freshness, the dainty charms of a young girl in the fullness of life and health. The oval of her countenance was somewhat shorter than in the Grecian model; her features were small, and softly rounded, giving them an inexpressi- ble charm of grace and candor; hair dark, and eyes a shade darker; eyes, rich and full of soul; and a complexion so delicate and fair, that the least touch tinged it a deeper pink. These, added to an elastic form, moulded like a Hebe's, completed an exquisite type of American female beauty; that beauty, so emi- nently classic and patrician, but alas, so eva- nescent. Our children are all cherubs; our Sylvias and Clelias of seventeen are endowed with rose-   AMY AND ARABELLA PAGE.    53 petal faces, and Phidian-cut features. But at five-and-twenty-Heavens! what a change. What ruin do we behold?  What poisonous simoon has blighted these fair flowers? Dr. Colocynth will tell you: "It's the climate, my dear sir-the climate!" and the doctor will learnedly descant on the desiccative properties of our west winds, and their effects on our popu- lation, when, in fact, the cause lies simply in -neglected stomachs; because our girls live on pound cake and preserves, and breathe furnace air! Yet Dr. Colocynth is fully aware of this, but, instead of prescribing steaks and exercise, he doses their feeble frames with quick- silver and opium. But, again, a physician's business is to cure disease, not to prevent it; and don't all the world laugh at the noodle, who killed his goose that laid golden eggs? "I wish, my child," said Mrs. Page, in her dry tone, "I wish, Amy, you would exhibit'a little more animation in society. I wish you had a little of Fanny Hyson's dash. It does seem to me that you appear exceedingly awkward at certain times."  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7896-00000028"/> 54   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "How so, mamma?" inquired Amy, raising her eyes. "The other evening," continued her mother, "the other evening, for instance, you appeared like an ill-bred country girl, and before Captain Rackett, too. I wonder what he must have thought. I really felt vexed at the manner you acted." Amy was silent. Arabella had laid aside her book during the colloquy and listened. "Yes," said she, after a pause, "I noticed it also. You seemed to be pointedly inattentive to the Captain." "I know no reason to be otherwise," said Amy, addressing her sister. "O, you're very innocent," returned Arabella sarcastically. "( For my part, I think the rude- ness was intentional." "I should hope not," interposed Mrs. Page, with some asperity. "No daughter of mine could be guilty of any impoliteness to a friend of ours."

Amy reddened. "Why do you tease me in this way? Why are you so unkind?" "He! he! he!" retorted the amiable girl, forcing a derisive laugh. "Dear me! how charming, how pretty." "Arabella, my dear, be silent," said the mo- ther. "Amy, I command you to treat Captain Rackett with all the courtesy, deference, and respect, due one of your mother's friends." Poor Amy's feelings were so discomposed by this attack, as to unable her to control her tears, and she left the room weeping. Arabella's eye followed her with a malicious -even malignant gaze. The controlling passion of Mrs. Page's eldest daughter, was envy. Deprived by infirmity of the pleasures natural to youth, and which her ardent nature longed for, the passion had in- tensified into morbidness. Her pride and vani- ty, of which, like all envious people, she pos- sessed a large share, being constantly rebuffed, embittered her life. She was no meek sufferer;  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7896-00000029"/> 56   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. no patient invalid-this proud girl-but the violent, arrogant, soul compelled to chafe in impotence, like a toothless tiger, vented its spitefulness on those within its power. She inflicted the pin-stabs of her malignity on a kind sister, whose only fault was her comeliness. For Amy was a rankling thorn in Arabella's side. The praise and admiration, the beauteous girl inspired, were as draughts of aloes to her decrepit sister. And bitterer still to Arabella was the consciousness that, had it not been for the disease which cursed her, she also, might have commanded the admiration-aye, the as- pirations, the devotion, of love. But now, what was she? A poor, neglected, slighted, pitied, object! And when she thought of this, her proud soul lashed itself into tortures far keener than the tame pains of a sick-bed.   CHAPTER V. DON FRANCISCO MENIL Y GUZMAN. THE grand ball that closes the season, took place at the Sans Souci Hotel. It was, of course, a magnificent affair, and for a detailed account of which, the reader is po- litely referred to the city journals of that date, where he will find a minute narration of the festivities, including the initials of the principal guests; a description of their costumes, etc. There were some personages present, how- ever, not mentioned in the public prints; for instance, Richard Jeffers, Esq., who strolled through the halls, attracting much attention by his stylish figure. and gentlemanly bearing. Many a lady turned to look at him and inquire of her partner, who that distingue looking indi- vidual was? Probably the partner knew; if he 3*  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7896-00000030"/> 58   THE SPUYTENDUYVEI, CHRONICLE. did, however, he carefully abstained from Im- parting that knowledge to others, for obvious reasons. Indeed, there were but few handsomer men at the Springs that season, than our dashy leg, who, also, sported the neatest turnout, as he reined his span of Morgans before a box phaeton, with one of the " bank" waiters on the back seat, trigged in drab leggins and cockaded hat. Mrs. Page, alone of her family, appeared at the ball, Amy being prevented (to her satisfac- tion) by some unforeseen circumstance. The Hon. Captain Rackett was much chagrined at her absence, but, nevertheless, dissipated his regrets at supper, and enjoyed himself hugely. Fanny and Alf. got miffed at each other, oc- casioned by Fan's flirting desperately all the evening with Pancho Menil y Guzman, the young Cubano. Alf. was quite huffy and he- ;roic, but Fan., with a toss of her head, told him he was a fool, and bade him reconcile him- self at his pleasure. And Pancho was a great favorite with the ladies. He. told them, in his sweet, broken, accents, how much he admired American ladies, who were, he said, the most   DON FlANCISCO MENIL Y GUZ IAN. 59- beautiful women in the world. He also in- formed theml, confidentially, that his family were true " blue-blooded" grandees in Arragon, and that his uncle, Don Pepe, the old man in the blue cloak, owned, in Cuba, two thousand slaves, five sugar-plantations, and the finest vegas in the Vuelta Abajo. To Fanny he was particularly attentive. During a stroll in the garden, he made a passionate avowal of his "Iofe," and sportively insisted on retaining her enameled watch and chatelaine, saying he would only part from them  with his life. Strangely enough, he kept his word, at least they were not returned to Fanny, who had al-, lowed him to wear the watch that evening; for the next morning, Pancho Menil y Guzman decamped by a very early train, leaving with the Messrs. Marvin an unsettled bill, and seve- ral empty polmatum pots. Great was the fluttering among the femi- nines when this fact transpired. Many of them having exchanged rings, bracelets, and other trinkets for the vows of this volatile gal- lant.

The old Don twisted a cigarrito, shrugged his shoulders, muttered, c"Quien sabe?" and gave them to understand, that the delinquent was only a casual acquaintance, and had also victimized him out of five Spanish ounces. Perhaps no class of foreigners obtain such success over the susceptible hearts of our na- tive damsels as Spaniards. Their raven hair, velvet eyes, -small feet, and the silver-toned Castilian-the simplest and grandest tongue- prove irresistible. At least, Senor Francisco Menil y Guzman found it so. The ball closed the season at the Spa, and, with the exception of a few old-fashioned vale- tudinarians, all departed. The Pages, instead of passing the autumn months at their country-seat, returned to the city, whither the Captain, kindly deferring a visit to Canada, consented to accompany them. We now find him, his sole-leather trunk, va- lise, hat-box, and cane, domiciliated in the mansion on the Parade ground.

He accepted soon after the presidency of the Killaloo Club-an organ- ization in the pay of a political party, and devoted to the propagation of republican prin- ciples, and the destruction of antagonistical ballot-boxes at primary elections. Edgar, sullen and chop-fallen, had left seve- ral days prior to the departure of his family. We find him now in the city, confined to his room, smoking cigars, and wearing his hair carefully brushed over a healing scar. Fast life in New York is an humble imitation of that of London and Paris. It partakes, in a slight degree, of the peculiarities of each. Our wealthy youth, lacking the stamina of the English blade, endowed by cricket at Rughy, and boating on the Cam, with the frame of an athlete, is debarred from the rude feats of knocker-wrenching, milling cabmen, etc. Be- ing also without the taste or wit of the Parisian jeunesse dore'e, he remains an abject imitator of each, forced to content himself with mild deeds   &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7896-00000032"/> 62   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. of dressing, getting tight, flirting, and polka- dancing. Edgar Page, whose well-developed frame led him to prefer athletic sports, had sought re- creation in the ruder and grosser amusements. Shunning the drawing-room, as too insipid for his active temperament, he mingled with jockeys, prize-fighters, and gamblers. Here his generous heart ruined him. Frank and un- suspecting, these leeches' found him an easy prey. Jeffers soon- singled him out as a fine pigeon to pluck, and, step by step, led the art- less youth on the Appian way to hell. This consummate tactician avoided the usual greedy method of less skillful hawks, and, instead of submitting him at once to wholesale plunder- ing, proceeded systematically to work. The first point was to gain his intended victim's confidence, then, after getting him thoroughly under the fascination of play, to mildly ad- vise him to desist, well knowing that Edgar had no more control over himself than a hum- ming-bird has under the magnetic eye of a, toad. Thus had Edgar been sucked into the vortex   DON FRANCISCO MENIL Y GUZMAN.  63 of vice, and the unfortunate victim, with brain sodden by dissipation, became as wax in the moulder's hand, regularly yielding the major part of his handsome allowance to the clutch of the superfine sharper.  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7896-00000033"/> CHAPTER VI. MRS. PAGE'S SOCIABLE. MR. HAMMERSLY MX was yawning over The Attic Salt-cellar, at the northernmost win- dow of the Union club, when his attention was aroused by a carriage crashing to the curb in front of Delaine &amp; Dimity's. A young girl, richly attired, stepped from the vehicle. He saw not her face, but the pavement be- ing muddy, she displayed a rounded ankle and small foot, shod in the snuggest little tan- colored gaiter in the world. "By   Jove!" thought Hammersly, smitten through broadcloth, linen, and pericardium, "there's an Arab instep. I wonder who she is?" Seizing his hat, Mr. H. Mix left the club- house, walked to the equipage, and stood for a   MRS. PAGE'S SOCIABLE.    65 few moments, glass at eye, critically examining the bays. "A fine pair, those. Whose are they, my man?" said he, addressing honest Mr. Hamil- ton, the sable coachman. "Yes, sir, they are that," answered Hamil- ton with justifiable pride. "They belong to Mr. Hyson, sir." "' Ah, indeed!" said Hamumersly, turning to examine Fanny, who came from the store, fol- lowed by the polite shop-walker, bearing a package. Fanny returned stare for stare; she could have stared the Sphynx out of counte- nance. The door was slammed to, and the carriage wheeled off. "Hyson, eh?" soliloquized Mr. Mix, as he returned to the club. "Who'd ha' thought the old rascal had such a pretty daughter. Gad! I must seek an introduction." Mr. Hammersly Mix was the son of an emi- nent jurist, and bore a name illustrious in American history. Unfortunately, however, while inheriting the name and wealth, he had not received a spark of his progenitors intel- lect. He had graduated at Nassau Hall, then  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7896-00000034"/> "   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. 'travelled-dawdling through the palaces and cathedrals of Europe-and returned home with an affectation of English manners, a taste for Parisian cookery, and a large collection of French phrases, which he mangled in the most amnusing manner. As the great Artificer has made nothing in vain, we must presume Mix had his uses.  His creative faculties were naught, as the most laborious work lie ever did was breaking in new boots; but he an- swered the purpose of t tool-an eating ma- chine for cooks, and a wearing machine for tailors, and besides rendering poor men recon- ciled to their lot, he served as a warning to all indolent boys He was "tall, slimn, and-elegant," ladies said, and wore a heavy, overhanging moustache, flanked by limp whiskers. He assumed a spe- cies of supercilious impertinence, wlhich he imagined was the acme of European refine- ment. He was mistaken. It is not customary with either English or French gentlemen to elbow your'neighbor, or tread oin his toes, with- out apologizing. Politeness is like an air-cushion, some Demo..   MRS, PAGE'S SOCIABLE.    67 critus has said. There may be nothing in it, but it eases the jolts of life marvellously. Mix readily obtained an introduction to Fan- ny Hyson, and found momentary relief from the fatigues of indolence in the sprightly ban- ter of the little Circe. One evening they went to the opera. Some individual, more sanguine than shrewd, and actuated by the laudable desire of inspiring the American public with a taste for refined music, and filling his own pockets, had imported a corps of Italian vocalists, to perform at the newly-erected theatre in Astor place. Mrs. Page had subscribed for the season. From a prominent box in the second tier, she displayed tri-weekly, a splendid diamond necklace, blazing on her painfully developed clavicles. On the night in question, Amy and the Cap- tain were also present; the latter chatting, and showing his white teeth. Fanny and Mr. Mix were seated on the op- posite side of the'house, Mix scanning each nook and corner for a pretty face. Fanny, ob- serving her friends, playfully shook her bouquet  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7896-00000035"/> 68   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. at them.  Mix, in his tour of observation, caught sight of Amy, where his glass lingered during the greater part of the performance of Barbiere. Gem of operas! Brilliant creation of Ros- sini the Grand! Who can listen unentranced to those light, liquid notes, sparkling like crystal spray, or falling richly and softly as a shower of spangles. Who does not float into opium dreams of Sevilla la maravilla! Sevilla the proud, where the beggar wraps his tattered capa, and struts with hidalgo haughtiness; to Andalusia-land of golden skies, of perfumed atmosphere, of arabesques, and marble foun- tains; anh see the laced dames at the gilded mirador, the panther-like majas, with flashing eye, and gartered poinard, while the gay segui- dilla, the castanet, and rattling fan, mingle in the picture of enchantment! With the closing crash of the orchestra, a cavern gloom palls our soul. We are clay again, and return to the dull, droning world. From that night, Mix became a slave to Amy's charms. Fanny promised to present him to her friends. She imparted his desire for   MfRS. PAGE'S SOCIABLE.   69 an introduction to Mrs. Page. This lady, de- lighted at the opportunity of cultivating the acquaintance of a young man of " such good family," met his wishes, by giving a sociable, to which Fanny invited Mix's escort. Punctually at the appointed hour, Mix and Fanny arrived at Washington square. Hammersly bowed his respects to Mrs. Page. Arabella was at her side. "3lMy daughter, Arabella, Mr. Mix," said the mother. "1 Ah, delighted!" and with a short stare he turned away, in quest of her sister. Amy had shrunk aside on observing him enter, but he quickly singled her out. "Miss Page, permit me-I had the unspeak- able pleasure of seeing you at the opera the other evening. SMay I hope you were pleased?" "Very much, indeed, sir," answered Amy. "Yes-the rendition was exceedingly well executed-a-that is to say, as well as-such things are executed in this country, and-a-- by that class of performers. Charming girl, Fanny, isn't she? So exuberant, so "spirit- well." Mix prided himself exceedingly on his French, as in fact, on everything else. He  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7896-00000036"/> 70   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. endeavored to engage Amy in conversation, but with little success. She was generally re- served in society. To exchange the trite, insipid phrases, called small talk, was beyond her en- durance. It is an onerous task for a sterling mind to prattle platitudes. The Hon. Captain Rackett was in the back drawing-room, the centre of a bevy of laugh- ing girls. Mix noticed him somewhat superciliously. "The honorable Captain Frederick Rackett, son of the Earl of Fitz-Barbacan," remarked Mrs. Page, with some emphasis. "You proba- bly know the name." "O-ah-yes," drawled Mix, reconciled, "I saw him once-quite intimate with the Earl in fact-we crossed the Simplon together. A very gentlemanly nobleman, indeed, though unfor- tunately a martyr to podagra." "Come, let me introduce you," said Mrs. Page, taking his arm. The Captain was a little displeased at being disturbed in his amusement, and bowed stiff- ly to Hammersly. "Now," said Ahrs. Page, "I must also intro-   MRS.

She was literary, and corre sponded with the WeeklyGleaner, under tie noir de ]plume of Delia Daha. A tall, spare man, bearded like Titian, was describing, with enthusiastic face, to Mr. Roose- velt, his rambles in the Adirondack region. It was Alexander Thurleston, a landscape paint- er of some renown. "One evening" said he, "I proceeded towards the -foot of the highest peak. Leaving a dense grove, I emerged sudden- ly on a portion of Paradise. Such a surprise; I stopped involuntarily, awe-struck, as a rash intruder in the home of Dryads. Imagine, if you please, a small sheet of water-a diamond in an emerald setting-a lakelet-so lucent, so still, that, in its diaphanous depths, the purple fish could be discerned suspended in the crystal,. or darting away like argent arrows. On one side, a wood of maples, larches, firs, and nee- dle-leaved pines, traced clearly on the blue. In the background, the precipitous plane of I  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7896-00000037"/> 72   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. the frowning mountain, rising blackly sky- ward; and, on the western side, a gradual de- scent to the valley. Imagine all this to be seen at an autumn sunset; the occident in con- flagration; crimson and gold floods suffusing the silvered azure, and shedding a warm penumbra on the orange and scarlet leaves, on the sienna trunks, and verditer boulders. I stood there in motionless admiration, hardly daring to breathe, and expecting every moment to be- hold the scene vanishing like a vision, until night bade me retire. I have seen the Tyrol- ese lakes, Windermere, Loch Lomond, but nothing to compare with this exquisite high- land tarn." "I understand that delicious salmon trout, are to be caught in those lakes. I should like to fish there," said Mr. Roosevelt. "Fish there! Would you-could you fish in such a spot?" said the artist, aghast. "Mr. Roosevelt would fish in the Ilissus, or in the rills of Helicon, I believe," said Miss Euphemia Page. "O, unaesthetical man; could you ruthlessly dip a lead in this mirror of the nymphs, and 4   MRS. PAGE'S SOCIABLE.   73 sit stolidly watching a cork amid such beau- ties. Roosevelt, could you fish in the violet deeps of beauty's eyes? Could you shoot at cranes resting on the pediments of the Parthe- non?" All this was jocularly said.

"Now, gentlemen," interrupted Mrs. Page, "do listen, Miss McKilty is going to favor us." Miss McKilty was the .prima donna of St. Magnus church, of which fashionable and de- vout congregation Mrs. Page formed part. Quietly taking her seat at the piano, she sang with much good taste, "Ah non giunge." "Exquisite! dee-lightful!" said Miss Eu- phemia, at the conclusion. "What do you think of our republican voices, Captain?" inquired Mrs. Page. 4  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7896-00000038"/> 74   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "Very fine, indeed," said the Captain, who had been laughing and chattering during the singing, " very fine!" "Yes," said Mrs. Page, patronizingly, and fanning herself with a regal air. "( Yes, Miss McKilty has a sweet voice, and modulates her tones with much expression." She had a lingering doubt as to the propriety of praising Miss McKilty, this lady having been invited solely for her singing, and being, in fact, as much a part of the evening's entertain- ment as the wines or ices. "Foe my part," said 1Mr. Roosevelt, "I cannot comprehend liow persons, unacquaint- ed with the language, can appreciate Italian music; I much prefer a siinple English ballad, to this florid, ornate melody, though I must add my praise (bowing to Miss McK., who had retired to her due insignificance), to the grace- ful talent, and artistic manner', with which it was performed. Still, it appears to me that the pleasure one receives from harmonious sounds, is much enhanced by the sentiment expressed in the accompanying poetry. sMay I trespass so far on your good-nature, Miss   VMRS. PAGE'S SOCIABLE.    75  McKilty, as to ask you to sing some English ballad?" Hj;   Miss McKilty complied, and sang ".Love's IAv  Youngr Dream." i:   "Now, Amy," said Mr. Roosevelt, after Miss McIKilty had concluded, ," you must sing me one of those old Scottish songs I have heard you sing with so much pleasure." utJg  Amy, ever ready to please her guardian, !ai whom she held in great esteem, sang one of   those old Jacobite songs, redolent of the hea- ther, wild as the glens, and plaintive as the coronach of the Gael.

Or must we cull our lays from the extemporization of slaves, and cherish the corked banjoist as our bard and minstrel? Amy's voice was eloquent, pure and soft as her beauty.  How  irresistible this additional charm--at least so thought Mix, and so did Mr. Roosevelt, who sighed to be thirty years . younger.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7896-00000039"/> 76   THE 'SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "Amy, my child," said the latter, when she had concluded, " accept my thanks for your kindness." "Miss Page," said Mix, " you have enthralled me. Philomel would die of envy." Amy, though annoyed at his pertinacity; could hardly refrain from laughing. Ham- mersly plumed himself on having turned a neat compliment. He continued-"What an ele- gant bouquet!  Do you admire camellias? You remember the ' Miller's Daughter'- And I would be the tuber- Rose, or japonica so white, That nestles round her tiny nose, Or peers into her eyes so bright. I'd never fade, but bud anew, If I were only clasped by you!'" While emphasizing you, he darted a killin glance at Amy. "Really, Mr. Mix," said she, laughingly you improve on Tennyson." "Nothing-nothing-impromptu," said Mi: carelessly. It was an impromptu that had nearly cos him a cerebral fever to concoct three month   MRS. PAGE'S SOCIABLE.   " before, and belonged to his list of stereotyped compliments. "Who is that conversing with the Earl- with the-Captain Rackett?" inquired he. I:  "That is Miss Brockaway.  Are you ac- quainted?" ?  "Superb creature, isn't she?" I   "And wealthy, Mr. Mix." "Indeed! I must get an introduction." As he turned aside for a moment to obtain a better view of the "superb creature," Amy accepted Mr. Roosevelt's arm, and they went down to supper. Here the Captain was in his element. He was much taken with wicked little Fanny, and was carrying on an intense flirtation with her, much to the annoyance of Miss Brockaway; a girl with a face like a rosy pastel in an ebony frame. Mrs. Page was weighing in her mind certain probabilities in regard to the Captain and Mr. Mix. The latter, to his great chagrin, was seated next to Arabella, whose coldness and silence added to his discomfort. Mr. Roose- velt was quietly eyeing the Captain, and felt a growing dislike to that personage, as he saw  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7896-00000040"/> 78   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. him monopolize a cold partridge, and drain several huge bumpers of Hermitage. The conversation now became general. They talked about the new contralto-Mrs. Miggles- worth's reception-the Rev. Arthur Damson's hands-Mailliard's marons glac--the wedding gifts to Dr. Context's daughter, fifty dozen sil- ver spoons, score of watches, dozens of brace- lets, and wedding-dress, costing fifteen hundred dollars-about Banghup's new house with the silver grates and door knobs, and gold spittoons -then an animated debate as to which of the Misses Hunkeyford had captivated the young Emperor Francis at Vienna-then about the last new novel--"The Whitewasher"-and so forth. The Captain had been making the best use of his time, you may depend. With his rollick- ing way he pushed a claret-jug towards Mr. Roosevelt-- Try this, Mister-Mister-what- d'ye-callum." "Mr. Roosevelt, sir," said the old gentleman sternly. ' I beg pardon, Mr. Rosywelt-Ho! ho! ho! Well, try the wine-I doubt if ever I tasted   MRS. PAGE'S SOCIABLE.   79 better in Europe. Appreepo, as we say in- French, I drank some superior Tokay once," began the Captain, throwing himself back in his chair and looking around with a glowing face. "It was at Vienna-I was hattashay to the embassy at the time. Lord Harry Gulper and I went to dine at old Metternick's. Of course the best in Vienna were there-Hesterhazy and his diamond jacket, and lots of other nobs. They tried to fuddle me before the evening was over. Gulper and Hesterhazy swigging on Jonesburg and Ruddyshimer, while I stuck to Tokay. 'I say, Rackett, my boy,' says old Metternick, ' try the Shatto Margo.' 'No you don't,' says I,' this tipple 'ill do for me,' and prime stuff it was, too; but in less than three hours, old Metternick was under the table, singing 'Nix my Dolly,' and Hesterhazy was drunk as a lord. I gave them each such a tum- bler of salt and water, and I give you my word that, in less than ten minutes, they were as sober as you or I." At the recital of this exploit Mr. Roosevelt became thoroughly disgusted, an(a remarked afterwards, that the presence of the ladies,  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7896-00000041"/> -80   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE.' alone, prevented his pulling the fellow's nose. Enlivened by frequent potations, the Captain became exuberantly gay. He was the life and soul of the party- -"Roseywelt you don't drink--Robert, you rascal, fill Miss Hyson's glass." "O no, please, Captain, I couldn't take any more." "But you must." After a little by-play, Fanny,-not averse to the nectareous fluid, permitted her glass to be replenished with champagne. "Mrs. Page," said the Captain, " you should go to England. Hang it! this is no country for a gentleman; it's only fit for snobs. There is no style here. Such liveries! and Johns in shocking four-and-nines! Bless you, madam, you should go to London." "I should like to go abroad very much, but I dread so crossing the sea," said Mrs. Page. "A friend of mine, Mrs. Doolittle, has lately returned from: London, where her husband, the General, was Secretary of Legation. She told me she was highly gratified with her tour. She   MRS.

I'd show you more life in a fortnight than you could see here in a twelvemonth- there's the opera, for instance, and drawing- rooms, reviews, races, Greenwich Fair, and what not!" "O, I've no doubt there are abundant sources of amusement," said Mrs. Page. "Some of them, I understand, of quite an eccentric char- acter. I am told it is a common practice among the young gentlemen of the nobility for-a lark-I believe they call it-to play barrel or- gans in the streets, attired in primrose gloves and white ties." Mr. Roosevelt and Amy had retired to the drawing-room during this conversation. Mrs. Page rose from the table and the others fol- lowed.      4*  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7896-00000042"/> 82   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. From the fever flush on her cheek, and her empurpled lips, it was evident that Fanny had partaken overmuch of the bubbling Sillery. She sat at the piano and dashed off the popu- lar melody of "Fi! hi! hi!" The Captain, frolicsome as a young ele- phant,on being asked to sing by the ladies, roared out the "Standard Bearer," with varia- tions of his own. Now the Captain's voice vibrated between a very " robust" tenor and a rather " profound" bass; and from a pervading mellow huskiness, and liability to baulk in the upper notes, it was plainly perceivable that his vocal organ, like Falstaff's; had been im- paired by " singing of anthems." His effort, therefore, proved a failure, though hle enjoyed it highly, and treated them, as an encore, to an imitation of Tamburini's Suoni la tromba with equal success and noise. This accomplished, Fanny rattled off a polka, and the Captain, sportively clasping Miss Brockaway, whirled her around the room, regardless of the proximi- ty of chairs and tables. He was soon fa- tigued, and puffing like a corseted ox, took a fan from the piano to cool himself.   MRS. PAGES S OCIABLE.   83 Fanny ceased playing, and with mock im- perativeness, demanded her property. The Captain tantalizingly refused. Fanny sprang from her seat and strove to take it from him. A pretty struggle ensued; during which the fan was reduced to fragments. ' Now I don't care, Captain, you hateful thing," said Fanny with a provoking pout. "Don't you, my adorable Fan? But I do, and mean to keep these as keepsakes; and these, too," said he, snatching her gloves and handkerchief. "I think you are a-real-wicked-naughty man!" exclaimed Fan with affected indigna- tion, and as she endeavored to take her hand- kerchief from hm, he caught her hand and kissed it. Mrs. Page, who had watched him with vigi- lant eye, seemed somewhat displeased at this behavior. The concluding exploit of the British Lion, was to costume himself in Fanny's opera cloak and hood, and dance a grotesque pas seal in the hall, to the great delectation of the young ladies.

RAPID CHLDREN. Miss FANNY HYSON was a fair specimen of the class, denominated fast girls. Her father, old Samuel Hyson, had always enforced strict religious observances on his family. His household was redolent of sancti- ty. Piety reigned around. In following the scriptural injunction of training his children in the way they should go, his son and daughter had passed their childhood in a state of semi- asceticism. A straight-jacket system of educa- tion was pursued. The slightest fault at Sab- bath-school, or least inattention to the preach- er's sermon, was invariably punished. Occa- sionally, the punishment partook of the devo- tional, and correction was administered by a command to commit to memory certain chap-  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7896-00000044"/> 86   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. ters in the Testament. This resulted in the book, they were taught to reverence, becoming an object of detestation-a dreaded rod instead of a cherished balm. Such was the method employed to inculcate goodness in the child's heart-not tatght to love virtue, but to fear ,the chastisement of the transgressor. And can the result be doubted?  When the springs were released, and parental restrictions relaxed, the resilience threw the unfortunate children into the opposite extremes of heedlessness and skepticism. The boy, giving rein to long-pent passions, fell into vicious ways; and after a violent quarrel with his father, ran away to sea. He never returned home, but was killed in a drunken brawl, at Callao. Mr. Hyson, doubtless, imagined he was pur- suing the course best adapted to promote the welfare and happiness of his children; but we know it is good intentions misdirected that pro- duce the most mischief. It is often remarked, how many sons of pious and worthy people turn out to be what is technically called " hard cases." We opine that it is often the result of' a similar systenm, and that some parents would   nAPID CHLDREN.     87 shape their children's souls as cooks do jelly- in a mould. These people imbue religion with a melancholy tinge ; deem rejoicing and glad- ness foreign to its precepts, and believe hermits and hair-cloth acceptable to God. They place his ministers in an unnatural position; believe they must wear the solemnity of their profes- sion on all occasions; that they should ever re-, main frigid and sad, and that a nimbus of gloom should constantly surround their persons. We lately heard strictures on an eminent divine for his too enthusiastic art-criticism! Verily, we will soon deny them admiration, as evincing an irreligious proclivity. Recreation and sport being as much needed by the mind as food is by the stomach, man is led into vice, by seeking pleasure in wrong and forbidden paths. To counteract any evil ten- dency,-morality should be infused in our amuse- ments. To effect this, our clergy and public instructors should mingle in them. If these gentlemen would countenance well-conducted theatricals, races, regattas, etc., all their offen- sive features would be eliminated; and, thus purified, they would become innocuous, profit-  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7896-00000045"/> 88   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. able resorts, instead of presenting, as they now too often do, schools of vice. It might seem odd, at first, to behold Dr. Tyng cultivating the cornet; Dr. Chapin bowl- ing at cricket; or the Rev. H. W. Beecher playing euchre, or listening to some linnet- throated Amina; but the oddity would soon wear away. All innovations seem ridiculous. An inch more to your gabardine, or a red fea- ther in your casque, will set the world a-laugh- ing--men are such children. But we soon adopt the fashion we had previously ridiculed. A short time ago, moustaches were an abomina- tion, and a sign of temporary aberration of mind in the wearer; and now we know a high- ly respectable member of the Society of Friends, who wears a remarkably fine one, and finds it exceedingly wholesome, too. 'To return to the Hysons.' Fanny's mother was a harmless, insipid wo- man, afflicted with ill-health, and, according to her repeated assertions, constantly on the verge of departure from this sub-celestial sphere. As she had reiterated this declaration, at short in- tervals, during a period of twenty years, it is   RAPID CHLDREN.      89 to be presumed that her retirement had been protracted by unforeseen circumstances. Now, her asseverations, that she was " not long for this world," fell unheeded. A creaking door, they said, lasts a long while. Though illiterate, she -knew the value of education, and deter- mined that her children should enjoy its ad- vantages. Fanny was, therefore, sent to the most fashionable schools, and the best teachers in all the elegant accomplishments were pro- cured for her. But possessing no inclination to study, and being, unfortunately, the daugh- ter of wealthy parents, her politic instructors permitted her to do as she pleased, which plea- sure consisted chiefly in flirting and falling in love, diversified by dancing, shopping, and promenading Broadway. She was constantly under the influence of the divine passion; and her tender little heart had received as many stabs as a pincushion. Her attachments were innumerable. At four- teen, her music-teacher, Signor Ladronni, was driven distracted by her coquettish attacks; causing him to sigh deeply when thinking of Mrs. Ladronni and their ten children. Another-  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7896-00000046"/> 90   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. passion was for a curly-headed apothecary's clerk, which resulted greatly to the apotheca- ryv's profit, by Fanny's frequent purchases of tooth-brushes and Lubin's extracts. Then she adored Percalin, a young French importer, who kept an entrepot of taffeta ribbons, in Beaver street. Percalin was obliterated by a dashy shop-walker at Beck's, who, in turn, was eclipsed by the superior attractions of a certain light-comedian; then her glances fell on Alf. Dilly, then Pancho Menil y Guzman, etc., etc. It may well be supposed that the daughter of so opulent a man as Mr. Hyson, was not without suitors-many of them, doubtless, at- tracted as much by the papa's wealth as the daughter's charms. Percalin, indeed, with his multitudinous compliments, had one eye to the main chance.; and, after spending a small for- tune in bouquets and bon-bons, retired in despair, ungallantly styling la semillante Fannee, unl coeur de caoutchouc--an India-rubber heart. The Rev.

But, although his alabaster brow, white hands, and melodious intonation, were objects of admiration with all the ladies of the parish, his inaptitude for moustaches and polka-dancing blasted his hopes. And Fanny remained in maiden meditation, if not fancy free. Alfred Dilly is the male prototype of the class represented by Miss Fan. Alf. was employed as " check-clerk," in a Wall street bank, where he made but a dull show, and was retained solely by the influence of his brother, the cashier. His intellect neyer arose beyond skillfulness in cravat ties; his wit was limited to some stupid " sell." But he belonged to the Gimcrack Guards, a crack corps of elegant uniforms who paraded regularly, six times a year, from the Battery to Union square. He was also attached to the Ganymede Hose, an aristocratic fire company. Fire cap and military uniform, were the chief objects of his existence. You should hear the little fellow, at Poz- zoni's or Sinclair's, brag about his achievements at a fire, or offer, when tipsy, to whip any man  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7896-00000047"/> 92    TtIE SPUYTENDVUYEL CHRONICLE. in the crowd. Egad! he seems as pugnacious as Palafox, yet the bellicose youth was cuffed by his mother's maid, for attempting to kiss her, and kicked out of Jones' billiard-room by a marker, for threatening to " lam" that function- ary with a cue. Being the youngest child, he has remained mamma's darling. His father did not perceive the necessity of giving his childen more learn- ing than he had received himself; for, said he, unwittingly quoting the school sign, ("I got along well enough without going to college, and if a man can't get along with reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic, he can't got along at all." So Alf. studied the three " r's" for a short time, and was sent into the counting-room at thirteen. He now grew precocious, rapidly acquiring a taste for dress, cigars, and late hours. These  accomplishments, interfering with his business duties, he received an invita- tion to transfer his services to some other lo- cality, and was then fobbed off on the bank. He had a dispute, lately, with his father, who objected to his son's late hours.

It is a marvel to many, how Alf. can afford the dash-can support this style and display, on his limited salary. The following scrap of conversation between Alf. and his mamma, reported verbatim by the omniscient little bird, explains all: (Alfred has been, soliciting a loan. ) MAMMA doq.).  "Now, Alfy. dear, this is really too much. How can you, Alfy, treat your poor old mother so?

WE will conduct you this evening to Mr. Dick Jeffers' residence. Turning  from  the crowded thoroughfare into Park place, we descend the street half way to the College green, and stop at a house of handsome exterior. There is nothing about the building to attract our attention, or denote its occupants. On the contrary, it wears a deserted aspect, and seems to shrink from public notice. Prac- ticed eyes might detect that the number on the silvered door-plate is prominently bright and distinct, and the blinds too carefully closed; still, there is no skulking to second floors a  over tailor shops, and Mr. Jeffers occupies the whole house. 5'  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7896-00000050"/> 98   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Though technically known as a "hell," there is nothing particularly alarming in the interior of this mundane pandemonium. The rooms, as an auctioneer would say, are luxuriously furnished with rose-wood furniture, tapestry carpets, and ormolu chandeliers. It is yet early, and the play has not corn-  menced. In the back parlor, 'a dealer sits by the unemployed table, readiig the evening paper. In the front room, we find the proprie-  tor, Jeffers, in an arm-chair, conversing with our friend, Edgar Page. The latter sitting, heels on mantel and cigar in mouth. "So you drove to M'Comb's to see Rock, did you?" inquired Jeffers, continuing a con- versation. "Yes," answered Edgar puffing away, " and he looks as fine as wheat. He'll whip any man of his weight, you can bet your life." "They say Dunn's in good condition," said Jeffers. "Rock'll flax him out in ten rounds," re- turned Edgar dogmatically. "There's no telling-it's like everything else," said Jeffers.   MR. RICHARD JEFFERS AT HOME.  99 "I feel so positive about it," said Edgar, "that though I have already backed Tom pretty heavily, I wouldn't hesitate to risk a few hundred, or so, more." "Well," said Jeffers, " you know that Tom's my favorite, also, and that I've got my money on him, still, there's no knowing. Perhaps I may hedge, at any rate, I wouldn't advise you to venture any more." "I know what I'm about," returned Edgar. "If you feel inclined to back down, I think I can accommodate you." "If you insist upon betting, I don't know but what' I'll accept your offer. What odds will you give ?" "Odds ! come, I like that," exclaimed Edgar, flinging his burnt-out cigar in the grate, and taking a fresh one from the case on the mantel. "Well, I don't know,'" said Jeffers, "you were so eager, I'll take it anyhow; what shall it be ?" Edgar leaned back reflectively for a few moments. Jeffers eyed him sharply. "The fact is," spoke   Edgar abruptly, "that-that I'm short just now." &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7896-00000051"/> 100   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "That's easily remedied." "I don't know about that." "Can't you raise it? borrow it in some way?" "Well, I might try, though I'm in for so much already that--" "I guess we can arrange it," said Jeffers carelessly. "Draw your note, and we will see what can be done." The above conversation related to a prize- fight about to come off between Tom Rock and Dunn the "Cove of Cork," an imported bruiser. It created much excitement in sport- ing circles, and Edgar Page was one of the backers of the former pugilist. Waiters, setting the supper-table in the room they occupied; interrupted their colloquy. "Here, steward! some brandy in a wine- glass," said Edgar. The liquor was brought him on a silver salver by the nimble servitor. Edgar drank it at one gulp, and remained in torpid abstraction. The call for supper aroused him. He par- took but slightly of the hot viands, but applied himself vigorously to the champagne, which, in truth, was Mumm's Cabinet.   MR. RICHARD JEFFERS AT HOME. 101 After supper the gaming began in earnest. The banker, a natty little fellow, with trim whiskers and quick eye, slipped the cards glibly beneath his white hands. The table was sur-' rounded by players. Several young men were paying their initiatory tribute to fast life, and a portly grey-headed man--" capper" to the es- tablishment-was prodigally laying piles of bones on each card. If vanity ruins women, conceit ruins man. 'Tis the inflated imp of self-importance that leads us into the quagmire, and leaves us with a mocking laugh, befogged and floun- dering. It drove Mulroony from a lucrative market stall to the political arena and the sequence of neglected business and starving household. So, young Agio left his bank-desk and snug salary to enlarge his sphere of action. Mul- roony imagined himself the man for the exigency, and Agio confidently believed his financiering talents needed but a field to insure a fortune. Mulroony is now a ragged loafer, and Agio cut his throat to escape th? State prison.

Sensible men know well that the chances are against them ; that saloons are 'not kept and luxuries furnished gratis, solely for the purpose of affording every comer an equal opportunity to gain or lose. Still, so infatu- ated are they, so reliant on their luck, so con- ceitedly confident, that they gamble in the face of this, fully convinced that, although every other player must lose, they are destined to win. In a lottery of a million chances, each ticket-holder not only cherishes the hope that he will draw the prize, but is actually disappointed should it prove otherwise. A losing player will become discontented and angered, as if an unfavorable result were strict- ly a fortuitous circumstance. Standing by a gaming-table, the money dis- played kindles our cupidity-the ever-present conceit in our success incites us to play; we play-we lose-we play again-we lose again; prudence would caution us to desist, but the overweening reliance on our good fortune over- rides all objections, and we continue, until stripped of everything; we remain-astounded   MR.

Edgar looked listlessly on, but did not play, costly experience having taught him not to put his faith in faro; for, though there is an appa- rent fairness about the game, that renders it very attractive to the unsophisticated, like the. toothache, the novelty may please, but one is soon cloyed.   &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7896-00000053"/> CHAPTER IX. THE ANCIENT PISTOL. AT the upper end of Laurens street dwelt, at this period, an aged negro, named Johnson, who had the reputation of being extremely wealthy and miserly. He resided in one of a row of houses belong- ing to him, and tenanted principally by colored people. The buildings were somewhat dilapi- dated, and evinced but little taste for order or cleanliness in the occupants. The one that Johnson, or old Jeff Johnson, as he was called, lived in, presented a much better appearance than the others. It was a clean, three-storied brick house, with a high stoop, and bright brass door-plate. Old Jeff had been a slave in early life, be- longing to a Creole lady of Louisiana. His   THE ANCIENT PISTOL.    105 mistress, dying without immediate heirs, be- queathed him his freedom and a handsome legacy, as a recompense for years of faithful servitude. He came North, where, by judicious manage- ment of his money, he accumulated a fortune. Being totally uneducated, he was indebted to a sagacious and keen perception of character for his pecuniary success. His vocation was that of money-lender, and his custom comprised the most lucrative branch of the business. Small tradesmen, without credit, but who could at certain times procure ample security, sporting gentlemen, young -men about town, and others who were unwilling to appear before the public as borrowers-of such were his patrons. These being persons mostly indifferent to the percent- age charged, if they can but procure the moment- ary accommodation. Many of the faro-bankers and " ivory-turners" of the city had transactions with old Jeff; for these gentlemen do not al- ways do business on the cash system, and are often obliged to accept ' promises to pay" instead of ready money. Much of this paper is worthless, but sometimes the drawers are 5.    &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7896-00000054"/> 106   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. young men of expectations, who, when in re- ceipt of their fortunes, gladly smother the exposure of youthful indiscretions, by paying their obligations. Many a young man about to contract an eligible marriage, has been startled by a polite invitation from some law- yer to take up a long-forgotten note, and avoid unpleasant litigation and publicity-a request seldom; if ever, uncomplied with. The next evening after the conversation be- tween Jeffers and Edgar Page, the former called at the house in Laurens street. He was shown into the parlor. The domestic, leaving a spirit-lamp on the table, withdrew, to acquaint her master. It was a chilly evening, and the room was fireless. "Deucedly cold and cheerless, this," mut- tered Jeffers. "Any one could swear it was the infernal den of some rascally miser." The door opened. Old Johnson, wrapped in a cloak, shuffled in. By a quick glance over his copper spectacles, he recognized the visitor, but merely intimated it by a low grunt.   TIIE ANCIENT PISTOL.   107 "Ah, Mr. Johnson, how d'ye do? Health pretty fair, eh?' said Jeffers. "Ugh!" growled the old man, seating him- self; " can't complain-fair," and he broke into a fit of coughing. "( Well, Mr. Johnson, I was passing by, this evening, and I thought I'd drop in, as I know you like something good when you can get it, eh?" continued Jeffers, smiling, and drawing his wallet. "Ugh!" said the old man; "I dunno, I dunno." "I've got some tip-top paper here-a little note, at short date; there-what do you think of that?" Old Jeff was unable to read; still, he took the slip of paper, and scrutinized it. "What is it?" he inquired, at last. "A note of young Page's; you know him- good as gold." "Got no money," said the old man, return- ing it. "But look here, Mr. Johnson; you can't have anything better than this; you've had some before; you know all about it."  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7896-00000055"/> 108   TIIE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. "Got 'nuff of dat," growled old Jeff. "But you were paid the last-duly paid. What objections can you have to this?" "Ef it's not paid, dere be too long to wait." "But my endorsement's good for this amount, -I hope, and you know that when the estate's divided, the fellow will have a fortune." "Dunno--dunno nuffin," returned the old man, doggedly. "I got no money jes' now- can't allus hab money." "Well," said Jeffers, " you miss it, that's all. Such paper will do to keep; it's like wine-it improves with age. However, since you wont take it, I'll not press the matter. Good night, sir-good night." Leaving the house, Jeffers wended his way to another section of the city. Passing down Broadway, he crossed in front of the Hospital buildings, then entered a long, narrow street, that led into the purlieus of squalor and crime. In this Gehenna-this fag-end of the slums of Sodom--within shadow of the grim Tombs, where the gallows-tree flourishes-vice pullu- lates, and blossoms into crime.

Hard by, we find the " fence," or thieves' broker, and Sheeny and Moses transplanted, shop and flut- tering frippery, from Field lane. Here, also, are those never-failing baits and allurements of the Evil One: the dram, policy, and pawnbro- ker shops-those three insatiable hoppers, that devour the hard-earned wages of the poor, in exchange for disease, want, and despair. Up this noisome court, we see a huge brick pile. It is six stories high, built to stow the greatest number of human beings in-the least possible space. The architect has well accom- plished his intention. Families are packed like pigs in pens. They call it "1 Kelly's Barrack." -It belongs, however, to Samuel Hyson, Esq., who complacently avers, that it pays a better inter-  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7896-00000056"/> "O   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. est on its cost than any other piece of property he owns. So it does. It returns at least thirty per centum. "A leetle better than Government stock," adds Samuel, smilingly, "and just as safe." Hyson never visits the place, the rents being collected and brought to him by his agent, Kelly--a very efficient and faithful man, Mr. Hyson considers him. So he is-though a trifle brutal and summary, if the rent (invaria- bly in advance) be not promptly paid. And there are children born here. Here are immortal, priceless souls, committed by the Al- mighty to our care, and left by us to wither and rot. These are the children we unjustly and tyrannically abuse; we punish them for doing what we have not forbidden, them. Do we hang a horse if he kick a man to death? Why, then, should we exercise our vengeance on beings as little conscious of righteousness and evil as the quadruped. There are children of fifteen in our State prisons.

It is our burning shame, not to have enacted, long ere this, laws absolute enough to render it compulsatory upon all parents to send their offspring to school to be not only thoroughly educated, but, if needful, supported during that period at government expense. Jeffers traversed this wretched quarter, pick- ing his way carefully, to avoid the feculence that beset him at every step. Entering one of the large eastern thoroughfares, he stopped at a tav- ern in a side street. There was a large lantern over the door, and red baize covered half the win- dow, on the upper panes of which was painted the advisement, "Boarding and Lodging." This was a well-known sporting hostelrie, hight "The Ancient Pistol," kept by Slogger, an Englishman, ex-knight of the knuckles, and wLilom antagonist of the bold Belcher. On entering, Jeffers found the place thronged. It was the occasion of the final deposit of money staked in the forth-coming fight. Behind the bar, Slogger, a burly gray-head, in a white apron, was busily drawing " tobies" of ale. On the wall you saw his portrait (taken  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7896-00000057"/> "2   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. in a belligerent attitude), and surrounded by others representing Caunt, Ward, and Cribb, besides colored pictures of Epsom races, Melton hunts, etc. Jeffers pushed his way to a rear room, usually devoted to free-and-easies and sparring lessons, but now occupied by a miscel- laneous assemblage. A large detachment of professors-of the art-fistic was present. There was a study for the ethnologist in this gathering of gladiators. The physical points between the Celt, Saxon, and native, were well marked ip these finely-developed specimens of animal strength. There towered the champion, typical of American vigor, a graceful giant, straight as a spear, a fusion of the Apollo and Hercules, all thew and sinew, small face, cut features, slim cuniform jaw, and game head springing from the broad chest ; none of the Anglo-Saxon here, no large, moon face, yellow hair, and loggy frame; but trim, compact, clipper-built, and so well proportioned as to deceive the eye in regard to his muspular power. Another pugi- list, who stood by, famous for prowess in i" rough-and-tumble," seemed built of steel, was vivid as a cat, and possessed the veritable   THE ANCIENT PISTOL.   113 snake-head and falcon eye of the Roman Athlete. Foreign savants, who theorize on the degene- racy of the American race, should pursue their investigations among those whose habits..or oc- cupations retain the system in its normal state. The mass of our people, both physical and mental laborers, so outrage the laws of dietetics, that it ceases to be surprising to the initiated that so many compare unfavorably in physique with Europeans. When we study Brillat Savarin, and learn to love our dinners, we will mend all that. Our canallers, drovers, and butchers, we may add, present a different aspect in spite of the variable climate. Edgar was arguing with a man who was list- ening tipsily. This latter was a senator; a Gracchus of the Plebs-urbana. Born in the home of eloquence, of the blood of Burke and Sheridan, he was destined to sway the masses. He had the presence, the voice, the eye, the gesture of an orator. Master of intrepid rhe- toric, discerping invective, and bladed wit, he was formidable. To what position might he not have attained? But ere its ripeness, the  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7896-00000058"/> "4   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. acid of intemperance was laid at the brain-core, and the intellect crumbled. As Jeffers approached, Edgar turned aside to speak to him. "Well, what luck?" "No use, Ned, it can't be done," answered Jeffers. "Why not?" said Edgar with a stupid gaze from his roist eyes. "The old darkey wont do it." "Did you tell the old beggar you wasn't particular about the shave, eh?" "Told him  everything. He didn't care about taking the note anyhow." "Dammit! must have some money. Can't drain the old woman very well." (The old woo man was his respected ma, Mrs. Spuytenduyvel Page.) "What's to be done?" "Wouldn't any of your friends-wouldn't old Hyson advance anything on your next quarter?" "Not he! Get blood from a turnip!" "I'd do it myself," said Jeffers, " but I've got use for all I can spare just at present, and besides, you know, I've got that note for the sorrel mare that I suppose must lay over."   THE ANCIENT PISTOL.    115 "That's out of the question, I know, Dick, I wouldn't ask you, and I mean to take up the other note, if I can." "Well, if old Hyson won't advance, get his note; he surely will not object to that." "That's so! I'll try, anyhow." Edgar was considerably in debt to Jeffers. The latter held a note of his for $500, given in pait payment for a fast trotter-a Iambrino mare, that had won a purse on the Centreville track, and was, advantageously disposed of immediately after the race, by her owner Terretts; a livery-stable keeper. This mare had been matched several times since her delbt, without winning; and, singularly enough, had been twice beaten by the horse she had pre- viously conquered. She was sold for one thou- sand five hundred dollars-one thousand cash, and a note for the balance. Knowing ones as- serted, thatEdgar had been "put through a course of sprouts," and that the note had found its way to Mr. Jeffers' pocket, as remuneration for his services in the transaction. Jeffers, to account for his possessing it, told Edgar he had discounted it for Terretts, which the gudgeon  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7896-00000059"/> "6   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. believed. Besides, Jeffers was Rock's principal backer; but, having discovered that the oppo- site party had tampered with his man, to bribe him into selling the fight, he had pru- dently and quietly laid money on the other side. He endeavored, as we have seen, to draw Edgar into a bet, but the latter had, unfortu- nately exhausted his means. Hence, we per- ceive the motives that impelled him to assist Edgar in procuring money.   CHAPTER X. COUP DE MAIN. A FINE sunny afternoon, with just sharpness enough in the air to brace the nerves, and add elasticity to the step. The Hon. Captain Rackett has turned from the perron of the New York Hotel, and is stroll- ing gaily up Broadway. The Captain is en grande lenue. His dress, a miracle of taste and fashion.  Witness the trowsers of Glengarry plaid, the waistcoat of Duff tartan, the gorgeous gold-spangled scarf, the yellow gloves, and drab paletot thrown carelessly back to deploy the glories of scarf and waistcoat!  From gaiter-buttons to cus- pidal-collars, all is gotten up, as the advertise- ments say, in the extreme of magnificence, and regardless of expense.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7896-00000060"/> "8   THE SPUYTENDUYVETL CHRONICLE. Our iridiscent friend is evidently in a com- placent mood, and walks jauntily along, swing- ing his stick and smirking at the ladies. He has just passed Mr. Hammersly Mix, who, by-the-by, did not recognize him. Mix stalks along with his pale, vacant, face; languid as a wilted lily. We must admit, we prefer the vulgar, barbaric tread, of our red-faced friend, to the feeble elegance of our republican aristo- crat. Since Captain Rackett discontinued his visits to the Pages, as per request, he has offered homage at the shrine of the fascinating Fanny. -He was not a man to pine away at an unsuc- cessful suit, and, indeed, upon mature delibera- tion, had concluded, that Mr. Hyson's daughter would be a more desirable match, in a material point of view, than Miss Page. With this idea, he laid siege to the fickle heart of the former damsel, determined, with the dogged persist- ence of the Saxon soldier, to invest the fortalice, and carry it by a bold stroke. He had ample opportunity to prosecute his suit-Mrs. Hyson confining herself to bed-room and basement, and never entering the parlor, when any one.   COUP DE MAIN.      119 of her daughter's 'company" was present, while iMr. Hyson was too much occupied with the Bashi-Bazouks, or the Esquimaux, to at- tend to such small matters as his daughter's welfare. (Hadst thou but known, O Hyson, how often, whilst thou wast occupied with, or praying for the conversion of the distant heathen, thy daugh- ter was flaunting at theatre or opera-those temples of Satan, as thou namest them--how thy parental heart would have shrunk with hor- ror, O Hyson!) Captain Rackett turned down Fourteenth street. Meeting Madame 31egarey's young ladies, he tipped a succession of winks and grins, that enfiladed the procession. Then into the Avenue, until a few squares brought him to Mr. Hyson's residence. This palace of our merchant prince, was an elaborate structure, built in the Complex order-- a pleasant conceit of some ambitious architect, . that would have delighted Mr. Ruskin. Stop and admire, and you will concede that we have nmade strides in Masonry since the days of Hiraln the Builder.

Around the corner, you find an oriel window, an Ionic porte-cochere, and a carriage-house in the Flamboyant with a dash at the Byzantine. The structure, in fact, is considered a marvel of taste and beauty; and perhaps it is, yet, the embattled parapet, however useful in the Middle Ages for pouring boiling oil on mediaeval duns with middle-aged bills, will strike a modern observer as neither useful nor ornamental. The Captain rang at the Norman portal. Instead of a grim warder, rattling a huge bunch of keys, appeared Abram the knife-boy, rolling his china eyes. Without further ceremony the Captain sent in his name; divested himself of paletot and hat, and went into the drawing-room. Then, before the pier-glass, he pulled his shirt collar, passed his hand through his hair, smiled com- placently. Drawing off one -of the yellow gloves, he took a diamond ring from his vest   COUP DE MAIN.      121 pocket and slipped it on the little finger of his ungloved hand, and-he was ready. The interior of the house contrasted singu- larly with its exterior. The parlors were dreary, formal rooms, their white walls unre- lieved by any ornament, save a large engraving of the Signers of the Declaration of Izdependence and one of the Diet of Spires. The shrouded furniture was ranged with a precision that was inhospitable. In a few moments, Fanny rattled down stairs and danced in. "I'm so tired-I've been read- ing so much," said she. The Captain took a seat beside her. "What work has had the pleasure to entertain you?" "O! I forget what the title is--but it's so interesting--I skip all but the love passages, though.  There's one scene where Lord Mor- daunt--he's the hero-a   sweet fellow, with curly hair and dark orbs, stabs himself with his scarf pin, because Claribel refuses him a jetty tress. O! it's so delightful--Lord Mordaunt turns out to be a housebreaker after all." " Ah, indeed! Did you go out this morn- ing?" said the Captain, cooingly.  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7896-00000062"/> 122   THE SPUYTIENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "No; I was up so late last night. I went to a party at the Brocatelles. I lost my heart, too." Ah!" said the Captain, with a tender twist of the eyes, and drawing nearer. Lost it- who's the happy finder?" (How inquisitive you are." "I inquisitive? O! How can you be so cruel as to say so?" and he attempted to take her slender fingers in his fat, red hand. Fanny drew her hand away. "There's no cruelty in that, I'm sure." "( No cruelty! Ah!" (drawing a long sigh, and giving an insinuating leer). This last was a failure, for Fan began to laugh outright, and tap her Cinderella foot. The Captain assumed a solemn aspect. "Miss Hyson-this is hardly a fit subject for mirth or levity. Your generous nature would not per- mit itself-I am certain-to knowingly trifle, and inflict pangs, on a-simple and affection- ate heart." Fanny opened her eyes with surprise. "You must have observed," continued the Captain impressively-" you cannot have mis-   COUP DE MAIN.     123 taken the-the delicate attentions, I have paid you. "Well, what of that?" "What of that! Can you ask me, what of that?" said he reproachfully. "Oh! don't be serious. I don't like to be serious." The Captain choked his swelling emotions. "I will try-I will endeavor to smother my lacerated feelings, but-(a gurgling sound)- Miss Hyson-listen! From the first moment I beheld your charming countenance, I was im- pressed with a rapturous bliss unknown be- fore. I cherished this in my inmost heart. I had found the soul that was to beat in conge- nial unison with mine own. You certainly cannot have been blind to the devoted, ardent, adoration, I have laid at your feet. Say, an- gel!" he exclaimed, sinking with "corpulent grace on one knee, "' say you were not." "Why-I--" "Idol of my heart, say you love me!" "H-don't know, H" "Miss Hyson!" said he, vehemently, and springing to his feet. The time for trifling  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7896-00000063"/> 124:  THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. has past. Tell me plainly-put an end to my agony-calm the volcanic feelings of my bosom! Will you be mine, or am I rejected?" "Rejected!" exclaimed Fanny, curling her Roxalana nose, "I hav'n't thought of anything of the kind. Why, I don't intend to get mar- ried in at least two years. I hav'n't seen the person I would like, yet." "The die is cast-!" said the Captain, with the calmness of despair. "I have nothing to live for-this blighted heart must cease to beat," and he drew a revolver from his pocket. "What are you going to do?" said Fanny, turning pale. The Captain gave a tragic start, and flour- ished the pistol around his head. "Ha! You don't know my nature," said he, with a des- perate glare. "Six barrels! Double-shotted- twelve bullets through my crazed brain! A moment more, and a gory-clotted-ghastly- corpse rolls at your unrelenting feet!" Fanny screamed, and ran to the door. The Captain caught her quickly-stopped her mouth with his hand, and supplicated her to be quiet. "I'll live for your sake," said   I           COUP DE MAIN.     125 I'   he. "Say you will be mine-make me bless- ed." "I will-I--" said the bewildered Fanny. "Heavens be thanked!" said the Captain, dropping his weapon and clasping her in his arms. "You have saved my life. I live but for you, dearest darling-mine own one-when shall it be? When shall I call you by the sweet- est title of-wife?" The Captain, burly as a brewer, looked while embracingc this pocket Venus, like a jaunty bear caressing a raspberry bush. "I--I--don't know," said Fanny. ," Speak to pa-but don't ever act so again.  You frightened me almost to death." The girl had never seriously thought of marriage, and the Captain had been rebuffed by her laugh, each time he essayed to introduce the subject. At last, adopting the fierce ex- pedient we have just related, he impressed her so forcibly with his determination, that, alarmed and yet pleased, she yielded. The Captain called on Fanny's father. On entering the private office he found that gentle- man busily engaged, and took a seat to await  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7896-00000064"/> 126   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIRONICLE. his leisure. Mr. Hyson was at his desk, count- ing money he had just received from his steward, Kelly. This latter worthy was meekly sitting on the edge of .a chair, with his hat between his knees. He was a thick-set fellow, and would have been prepossessing, but for a low fore- head and thick brows, beetling over little gray eyes, and a small, sharp, snub nose. He wore a sanctimonious look, a plaster over his left ear, and a yellowish green aureola around his right eye. He was a converted Roman Catholic, and employed occasionally by Mr. IIyson to distribute Testaments and tracts. Mr. Hyson also allowed him the use of an upper room in the Orange street building, for the purpose of a Sunday-school for the little children of that neighborhood, and anticipated a deal of good from his efforts in that field, but Mr. Kelly had experienced unexpected difficulties and embar- rassments; for, in his laudable endeavors to bring some little Patsy Brallagan or little Bid- dy Moloney to the school, he had to undergo unequal and desperate combats with the mam- mas of these interesting juveniles, and the   COUP DE MAIN.     127 necessity of the plaster over his left ear was explained by the fact of Mrs. Moloney's resort- ing, on one of these occasions, to the kitchen I  poker.  The aureola around the right eye was the result of a conflict with Mick Hogan, the sexton of St. Honora's. Mr. Kelly (so he ex- plained it to Mr. Hyson) had stepped into Gallagher's porter-house, for a moment, to "prisint"Mrs. Gallagher with a tract on "The Sin of Liquor-selling," when, who should he meet but Mick Hogan himself, somewhat in liquor. Mick began immediately to use abusive and profane language, calling him a " heretic," an "ipostate," and so forth. Mr. Kelly mild- ly remonstrated with him, but Hogan boasting- ly offered to fight him for whisky-skins for all present. Mr. Kelly, horror-stricken at the pro- posal, was about to flee, when Hogan "tuck" him at the eye, and peaceable Mr. Kelly was obliged in self-defense to suggillate the sexton. Mr. Hyson expressed his condolence, and the money being found correct, the lamb-like Kelly departed, with the consciousness, that, if he did npt figure in some future "Book of Martyrs," the world was decidedly unjust.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7896-00000065"/> 128   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "Now, sir," said Mr. Hyson, turning around from his desk and pushing his spectacles on his forehead. "What can I do for you?" With soft-drawn words the Captain explained his wishes. Mr. Hyson was, for a moment, shaken from his equanimity. "What! marry my daugh- ter? Why, sir-who are you?" The Captain replied loftily, that he belonged to one of the oldest and noblest families in England-had testimonials which he could show (though he had not thought it necessary to come provided with them, his character be- ing sufficiently well established)-had letters from Barings, Rothschilds, Coutts, and many others-was cousin to Mr. Matthew Marshall; whose name Mr. Hyson might have seen on Bank of -England  notes-and was about to state his relationship with the India Board, when Mr. Hyson cut him short, with a brief, "Good morning sir-my time is pre- cious." The Captain was not so easily baffled. He told Fanny the result of his interview with her father, gaining her sympathies by expatiat-   COUP DE MAIN.      129 ing in heart-rending accents on the cruelty of her hard-hearted parent. Mr. Hyson lectured his daughter severely, and forbade all intercourse with the Captain. This had the effect of stimulating her oppo- sition; for she possessed considerable spirit, and a large share of that independence which characterizes American children. The Captain cunningly fomented this feeling; and Fanny, incensed at her father's interference in a matter so entirely and intimately her own, fell into the snare. By a little persuasion, she was induced to elope. They crossed to Brooklyn one morn- ing, where a facile clergyman consented to unite them. Fanny's heart failed her at the j uncture; but on the exhibition of a small vial, labeled Prussic acid, poison, and a threat of the Captain's to kill himself on the spot, she consented, and the ceremony was performed. Thus was this child of sixteen, who had never known any greater trial than that of a tight slipper, or a surfeit of sugar-plums, thrown into the possession of forty years of vice, simply be- cause our code permits a girl, at fourteen, to marry without parental consent.

The passion, in a sensitive person, becomes intense and vin- dictive beneath the stings of the world. Who would have thought, on beholding old Jeff, the negro usurer, that the same emotions which filled the heart of the great Somerset, lived, with two-fold vigor, in this mummified African? that, under the miser's seemingly- senile stupidity, he felt so acutely the world's contempt? In his intercourse with the whites, he was continually reminded that, though enjoying physical freedom, mere exemption from shack- les and bondage, he still occupied a position of degradation, was regarded as belonging to an  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7896-00000067"/> 132   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. inferior order of beings, akin to the brutes, Inca- pable of intellectual acquirements, and unfit for companionship or equality. Hie saw, moreover, how the potent talisman of wealth boughlt him the condescension and servility of the favored race; but he knew its hollow, contenmptible import, and he felt, as Shylock the Jew felt --implacable for the sycophantic pound of flesh. He ridiculed the efforts of his brethren, who were continually devising metlhods to secure equable Lights and privileges. He had long perceived how futile were all their expedients; he saw how the bands of prejudice still ironed the efforts of their professed friends-the abo- litionists-how it contracted their sympathy; for, whilst vehemently asserting the right of the negro to life and limb, they denied him confra- ternity and social equality. As for the uphold- ers of African colonization, he laughed their efforts to scorn, holding their scheme as one simply intended to rid themselves of the obnox- ious class. Expatriation he would never con- sent to; he and his brethren claimed, as an inalienable right, in the land of their birth, a   OLD JEFF, THE. USURER.   133 foothold in life, and a grave in death. Stoical- ly, he wrapped himself in his pride, brooding on his wrongs; taking and giving insult. He had espoused a white woman. Whether to show, by this act, how low the superior race could grovel beneath the golden wand, or to give a stab to prejudice, we know not; but he had sought and obtained a newly-arrived Ger- man girl, who, ignorant of the disfavor attached to blacks, was enticed, by the dazzling pros- pect of a life of wealth and ease, to accept him. She married him, living to bitterly repent it. Shunned by her friends and acquaintances--an object of aversion to the women of her hus- band's race-she became moody and vacant- minded. To steal respite from her existence of silent agony, she abandoned herself to lauda- num-drinking, and, at last, only escaped lunacy by death. The fruit -of this marriage was a daughter-a comely mulattress--who seemed to have inherited her mother's sadness. Secluded and isolated, like a caged bird, she knew less of life than a nun, and lived in dread obedience to her father's dark, deep will.  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7896-00000068"/> 134   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Old Johnson's sole aim of life was centred in this daughter; and he determined that she should never wed but with one of the favored tint. His ambition being, that his descendants should not remain branded Helots, consigned to contumely and disdain. This intention was so generally known, that it was currently cir- culated among the vulgar, that a bushel of gold pieces was to be the guerdon of the adventur- ous gallant of acceptable color, who dare brave public opinion for fortune's sake. Others said, a row of houses was to be Virginia's dowry, the day she wedded with her father's consent. With such inducements, it was not extraor- dinary that she had been sought in marriage by most of the eligible colored youth of the city, and not a few of the Caucasian plr sang. But Virginia was still a maid; the first aspir- ants being debarred by their dusky hue, and the latter comprised but worthless adventurers, glad to acquire a fortune at any sacrifice. With this slight sketch of the history and projects of the old negro usurer, we will re- sume our narrative where Mr. Dick Jeffers, accompanied by Edgar, visited him.   OLD JEFF, THE USURER.    135 Old Jeff being unacquainted with the latter, eyed himl rather closely. "Now, Mr. Johnson,"' said Jeffers, "I wish to introduce to you my friend, Mr.. Page. He has a little choice paper he would like to have discounted. The fact is, they are notes given by Mr. Hyson-firm Hyson &amp; Co.-to Mrs. Page, Mr. Page's mother.  Mrs. Page could readily sell them in the street, but, for obvious reasons, she would not like to have her name appear as a borrower. I believe that is the state of the case?" (turning to Edgar for con- firmation). "Precisely," answered Edgar. "It is hardly agreeable, you may well ima- gine," continued Jeffers, " for a lady of Mrs. Page's wealth and position, to apply for any such favor; but being at this moment in want of funds fobr a special purpose, she cannot well avoid it. She could easily procure it of any of her friends, but would prefer a method of less publicity, even if she had to pay a little more for the accommodation.  I  must also explain that these notes were given by Mr. Hyson to Mrs. Page, as part settlement of some property trans-  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7896-00000069"/> 136   TIIE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. action belonging to the estate of the late Mr Page; Mr. Hyson being, as you may be aware: one of the executors of this estate-there they are, two notes: six hundred dollars each, hav- ing six and eight months to run, respectively. The old man took them (pretending to ex- amine). "I don't think you can have anything better. Hyson's too well known to need any comment, and as for Mrs. Page," continued Jef- fers, laughingly, " why, it's doubtful if I'd prefel Astor's name.' With two such signatures, I don't think there can be much risk, dc you?" "I dunno," answered old Jeff with his cus- tomary caution.' He had been watching Edgar during the conversation and cogitating over the affair. There was something unusual in notes of this description being offered to him, espe- cially through such a medium as Jeffers. It appeared unaccountable; and with these sus- picions he was about to dismiss the matter ab- ruptly, when, on after consideration, he decided otherwise. Turning to Edgar, he said: "I see dat dey am not indorsed-call agin to-morrow -come alone-I spose d'ere yourn?"   OLD JEFF, THE USURER.   137 "Oh yes," interposed Jeffers, "I'-ve no interest in the matter beyond obliging Mr. Page." The usurer being unskilled in the use of the alphabet, it was customary for applicants to leave their vouchers until he took counsel on their genuineness. His chief adviser in such cases, was one Benagle; a wealthy lottery- broker that Johnson had established in busi- ness by " backing his books," and who, in grati- tude: proved an efficient, trustworthy coun- sellor. The next day Edgar called as appointed. The security was apparently satisfactory; for old Johnson, after a few trivial questions, told him that he would take them at twenty per cent. discount. Edgar, ignorant of the value of money, and satisfied if he could realize enough for present wants, regardless of ultimate cost, accepted without hesitation. Johnson gave him the notes to be endorsed by his mother. On returning with the neces- sary signatures, he received nine crisp one- hundred dollar-bills, which the usurer counted over not less than a dozen times.  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7896-00000070"/> 138   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. , How long you know Mr. Jeffers?" said he to Edgar. , Quite some time-can't say exactly." The old man gave him a searching look "Bell, I wouldn't be too friendly wid 'im ef ] was you-dat's all." 1,   CHAPT ER -XII. BREAKING THE BUTTERFLY. FANNY HYSON'S flight and marriage occasion- ed a great sensation in the fashionable circles. Elderly ladies and prudent mammas said it was "shameful," and denounced the Captain as an "adventurer," though some of them had pre- viously endeavored to scheme this same adven- turer into an alliance with their own daughters. The young ladies, on the contrary, sympathized with Fan, and justified her in escaping from the thraldom of harsh, unnatural parents. Our children are independent from the cradle. They chafe at parental control, believing-them- selves as wise as their parents, and some a lit- tle wiser. This is the strength of our republic- anism.

"I come to inform you-ah-um. I suppose you are aware that-aw-in short, that I have the honor to occupy the distinguished position of--that I am, in fact, your daughter's hus- band." "I am aware," replied Samuel Hyson, with resignation, 'that I have cherished a disobe- dient child, whose ingratitude biteth sharper than a serpent's tooth." "I merely wished to observe," said Rackett, tapping his boot with his stick, "that I aml ready and willing to accept any proposition or advice you may have to give-aw-respecting our future prospects.

Fanny did not dare approach her father. She visited the house clandestinely, however, dur- ing his absence, receiving the condolence of her mother (who thought Fan the wisest and best of human beings), and what was more neces- sary, pecuniary aid. For it appeared that, through some remissness on the part of the Captain's correspondents, his expected remit- tance " per steamer" did not arrive regularly; whereat his credit was at low ebb, and friends, tailors, boot-makers, etc., etc.,: who had ad- vanced on the faith of those remittances, grew skeptical, dissatisfied and urgent. Once, a stout gentleman in a state of plaid and pale ale, called at Mr. Hyson's office, de- siring to see him. After an elaborate apology, the gent broke suddenly into a violent philip- pic against the Captain. "The feller's a dem  swindle! I'll 'ave 'im arrested this instant!

"All I 'ave to say is this-will you pay the debt or not? If not, I'll publish the 'ole mat- ter to the 'ole world!

I am totally unaware that I have anything, whatever, to do with 1Mr. Rackett's debts." The man seemed unable to comprehend Mr. 'Hyson's placidity, and, after a little more grum- bling, went away swearing that they were all a pack of rogues and scoundrels, in, league to defraud him, and that he would get a warrant to " arrest the 'ole lot." After the first flush of wedlock, Fanny began to regret the step she had taken., Her caprice-it was not love-rapidly van- ished -at the discovery of her husband's true character and position. She wished to return, but dreaded her father's resentment. She en- treated her mother's intercession to procure her recall and forgiveness; but Mfrs. Hyson stood in awe of her husband, and hardly dared broach a topic on which he had enjoined strict silence. At last, she ventured timidly to suggest Fan- ny's return.

But Fanny's pride would r permit her, though she was sorely tried. Rackett, growing impatient at old Hyso obstinacy in refusing to acknowledge h was at times irritable, and even vexed at youfthful bride. He absented himself a gr deal, and did not come home until late in night, or early in the morning, and when did, he returned such a bombard of spi reeking with tobacco smoke, that Fanny thoroughly disgusted. One night, she was sitting up, endea ing to read a book through her dimn eyes.   BREAKING THE BUTTERFLY.   147 It was past one, and Rackett had not yet returned. At last she heard him muttering and growl- ing, as he tumbled on the stairs. Then he fumbled at the knob, and not being able to open the door began to kick and thump lustily. To prevent noise Fanny let him in. He stumbled in grumbling--"What-the deuce-do-you--lock the door for, eh?" "It wasn't locked," answered Fanny. "I say it was locked! What d'ye mean- hey?" Pulling a chair he managed to seat himself after a few drunken efforts. He took a cigar. "I say, Fan, give us a light." "Get it yourself. Smoking at this time of night!" said Fan aroused and angered.

Then, as the reality burst on her mind, she withdrew to her bed-room, covered her face, and allowed the scalding tears to course fast and full. At intervals, she could hear the heavy snoring of the Silenus, dozing off the effects of his debauch. Thus she passed the night. When morning broke, she hastily put on her bonnet; brushed past, without glancing at her sleeping husband; descended softly; and, on reaching the street, ran swiftly home.   CHAPTER XIII. AIGLE3IONT. IT was spring. Dame Nature had cast aside her ermines, and donned a kirtle of gay green. Riant, graceful lMay shook her chaplet of blos- soms, perfuming the light ether with balsamic fragrance. The newly-mated birds carolled their epithalamia, and bobolink twittered his tale of southern swamps and rice-seed. In the city, winter-imprisoned invalids ventured to the parks to drink draughts of new life; and the strong in health and stomach, to Win- dust's for salmon and asparagus. The Pages were at Aiglemont. Aiglemont was situated at -a short distance from Throgg's Neck, and built on a bold bluff, overlooking Long Island Sound. East of the villa, a row of huge Northern pines  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7896-00000076"/> 150   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. sheltered behind their titanic cones the farm- house-a stout old manse, with red shutters, wide porch, and most picturesquely surround- ed by dense shrubbery. Any one of taste, or romantically inclined, would have preferred it, as a residence, to the Italian villa erected by the late Mr. Page; and, in spite of its want of "modern improvements," the occu- pants of the buff-colored edifice were often, during the dog-days, glad to accept repose between its cold stone gables, and shaded roof-tree. The villa bore a somewhat denuded aspect; still it had some pretensions to architectural beauty, and escaped, the box-like air and flat roof of city dwellings. The latter imper- fection mars the effect of many of our fine houses. Better return to dormer windows and corbie-step gables, than build rows of unmeaning cubes. A lawn sloped to the roadside, and, on the edge of-the eminence, a row of poplars stood sentinelled, by which the place could be distinguished from the opposite shore of the Sound. Then an abrupt descent led to   AIGLEMONT.      151 the water's edge; and, from the acclivity, the boats on the surface seemed like shells-the steamers like vivacious insects. A grove stretched away from the rear of the old manse, where, amid the tops of some primeval oaks, the fish-hawks nested-birds which the farmer guarded with ancestral reverence, and loved to watch, when swoop- ing the waves in search of prey. Miss Euphemia Page had torn herself from her Albany relatives to sojourn, during the summer, with her affectionate sister-in-law. She continued her correspondence with the Weekly Gleaner, dating her letters from "Lily- dell"-an imaginary place-and giving delight- ful accounts of an imaginary pony, Prince; an imaginary cousin or " coz," Clarence, etc. Little Louisa, Mrs. Page's youngest child, was also at the house, on leave of absence from the Priory-much to the discomfort of every one in general, and the domestics in particular. This girl was then ten years old, of elfin make, and the  most mischievous plague imaginable.  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7896-00000077"/> 152   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. Her mother had foolishy imbued her from infancy with love of dress, and she now pos- sessed the vanity of a mature coquette. Her precocious intelligence and lively prattle made her a pet -with visitors, who encouraged her pertness until she had become disagreeably forward and familiar. She was especially annoying to her sister Arabella, who, by endeavoring to exercise authority, provoked her impertinent retorts. With Amy, she seldom interfered-the latter's quiet, unob- trusive manners not inviting Louisa's malici- ousness. The great event, since the removal of the Pages to the country, was the arrival of an old playmate of the girls-one Ben Coutant, who had been absent from. home at least ei ght years. Ben was the son of a neighboring farmer; a descendant from the good old Huguenot stock--the gallant French blood of Marion, Jay, and Faneuil. Coutants cluster as thickly around New Rochelle as Hasbroucks around New Paltz. Ben-(it was once hinted his name was Benjamin, but we scout the idea!)-Ben all   AIGLEMONT.      153 remembered, as the wildest scamp for miles around. He could run faster, jump further, climb higher, swim longer, and dive deeper than any other lad you could " scare up." At that age, when our effervescent blood shoots us off like a rocket at each impulse, Cook's Voyages, Robinson Crusoe, and sea novels, had sent him on salt water with an indefi- nite idea of becoming some grand personage- perhaps a cross between the Red Rover and a commodore.- Now Ben- had returned with a pair of horny palms, and a stock of that rough experience which teaches us, that all is not gold that glitters. A few hard knocks in early life, form an admirable tonic. The sooner a boy learns, that the roads of this world are not carpeted nor strewn with manna and quails, the better. And the village was in a ferment! He had brought back such wonderful curiosities and had seen so many strange places in his travels. He wore purple silk trowsers and jacket, made by a Chinese tailor, and was tattooed New Zea- land fashion, on his left arm! His miraculous camphor-wood trunk contained such stores of 7-  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7896-00000078"/> 154   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. shells, carved paddles, Feejee fish-hooks, spear- heads! and what not.  His little brother, Willie, became an object of open-eyed wonder, by running about with a scarlet gold-buttoned mandarin's cap on his chubby head. Ben came to visit his old friends, the Pages. He was awkward at first, for the widow's dig- nity embarrassed him; but he shook hands heartily with Amy, causing the tell-tale blood to mantle her cheeks. Arabella acknowledged him with a frigid nod; for his prior attention to Amy was sufficient to incur the enmity of this amiable girl; but Miss Euphemia bestowed a gracious smile, which restored his equanimity. Amy looked in astonishment at her boy lover. He had sprung from a light, active lad, to a tall sun-burnt man-straight and sinewy as a young Sioux brave. His features were not chiselled with Praxitelian art; he was not pretty; but you read truth in the frank brow and lucid eye. "I never should have known 'Amy-Miss Amy I mean-she has grown so tall and hand- some," said he. Arabella darted a look of sup- pressed rage.   AIGLEHONT.      155 "So you have been travelling, I understand, Mr. Coutant," said -Mrs. Page, condescending- ly. "Making a foreign tour. Ah! every one travels now-a-days. How far did you go, pray?" !"Well," said Ben laughingly, "I should say it was a lengthy tour, or rather a large one ; for I've circled the globe." "Indeed," said Mrs. Page. "Of course you visited Paris?" "No ma'am, I did not. Whalers seldom take that direction." "Ah!" ejaculated Mrs. Page, with a peculiar deflection of the voice, which meant, " only a sailor." Ben fell immeasurably in her estima- tion. Instead of a gentleman tourist, he was merely a vulgar whaleman. "You went to the South sea, Mr. Coutant, did you not?" inquired Miss Euphemia. "Yes, ma'am," answered Ben. He was in doubt whether to address her as miss or ma- dam. Her age warranted the latter appella- tion. s"Pray, did you visit Typee, that Mr. Mel- ville draws so enchanting a picture of?"  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7896-00000079"/> 156   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "And see any mermaids?" said Louisa. "No ma'am, I believe not." "Then you did not fall in love with some gentle Fay-a-way, and leave your heart amid the waving palms of the Pacific?" continued Euphemia. "No; I find it more convenient to carry that article with me," answered Ben. Then Ben brought in a large package con- taining gifts for the family. On being opened, it diffused a strong aroma of tea. For Mrs. Page, he had a crape shawl; for Arabella, a rice- paper album and sandal-wood fan; for Amy, pine fibre handkerchiefs; for Louisa, a set of rice chessmen; and to Miss EupheCmia he gave the embroidered slippers of some clump-footed Chinese belle; saying gallantly, they were too large for her to wear, he had no doubt, but he had chosen the smallest. AMiss Euphemia was delighted at the compli- ment, and declared he was quite " a Raleiigh!" He also set a joss, nautilus-shell and pearl- oyster, amid the trinkets on the ctagere and flanked the parian Ariadne on the mantel with branch-coral, and two large cachalot's teeth;   AIGLEMONT.      157 on one of which was etched, the "Blubber- hunter" barque,- and on the other, a savage warrior, tattooed like a checker-board. Mrs. Page saw this desecration of her parlor ornaments with alarm; and after Ben's depart- ure, instantly ordered the joss, shells, teeth, etc., to be 'removed to the kitchen. The crape shawl she gave to her maidS having already a much finer one. The shells, teeth, etc., were not taken to the kitchen, however, Amy, having a taste for curiosities, placing them in her own room. Amy pictured to herself that night, a cer- tain parting with this same Ben, years before, when they were children. A picture she had recalled, again and again. When Ben bid her farewell, one evening at the garden gate, and told her he was going to sea. How she looked at him in amazement, when he said boldly he was going to seek his fortune, and see the world. And she looked so sad at this; that Ben cheeringly said he would surely return; how she plucked a rose to give him, and he held it by her cheek, and said the flower paled with envy-and how her faced glowed at his re-  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7896-00000080"/> 158   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. marks. It was all very silly and childish, no doubt, but Amy thought of it often, neverthe- less; and in the winter nights, when the wind screamed, and the blast howled, she wondered where poor Ben was, and silently breathed his name in her prayers. Ben called again the next day, and stayed all the afternoon. He entertained the ladies with graphic descriptions of capturing the whale; giving the minutiae about striking the fish, try- ing out, etc., interspersed with numerous tech- nicalities, until Aunt Euphemia (who listened attentively in her laudable endeavors to sip knowledge at every fount) was completely confused with ideas of " spanker-booms, blub- ber, stun-sels, squid, Kanakas, shovel-nose sharks, tackles," etc., and dreamt that night of trying out the colored cook in the laundry coppers, to make- spermaceti tapers, while the fat wench shouted lustily: "Dar she blows!" After tea, Ben accompanied Amy in her even- ing walk. They were slightly embarrassed at first, but Ben's bluntness broke the ice, and the natural diffidence soon wore off. They chatted   AIGLEMONT.      159 gaily, and recalled reminiscences of their child- hood. As they returned, they passed the gar- den wicket-the spot where they had parted, Ben stopped, gazed searchingly in her face, caught her hand, and smiled--"Amy, don't you remember?" She cast down her eyes beneath his eager look, and the quick crimson suffused her white forehead. "What?" she answered at last, with an air of affected surprise. "Well," said he, dropping her hand, while his cheerful look was changed to one of sadness, ," Well, I was thinking, Amy, eight years ago, I left you here, expecting to return with a laced coat, a hainger by my side, and a bag of moidores, and-went on a fool's errand. Eight of the best years of my life; thrown away and wasted -eight years spent in knocking about from ship to shore-spent in the company of the scum of the earth-spent like a vagabond- like a Cain!" Amy was amazed. "What have I accomplished? What have I gained? Nothing, but to become purposeless  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7896-00000081"/> 160   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. -without ambition, without aim.  All my bright visions of future happiness, and gorgeous hopes, have vanished like a dream. It had been better, perhaps, had I sank in the sea, than realize this.': A Heraclitus at twenty-three! It was singular to hear this young man, elastic and buoyant with vigorous life, utter sentiments consonant only with an unnerved, sated Sy- barite. A word and look from Amy had caused this bitterness; a word and look from her effaced it. "Why, Ben, how can you talk so," said she. "How can you be so wicked-remember you have health and reason. Should you not be thankful, each moment of your life, that you are permitted to retain these, instead of repining uselessly." '"Amy, I'm a fool, and you're an angel, and as wise as Minerva," said he, resuming his levity. "But I could not help thinking with xhat ambition I  left home, and now I return, without having accomplished anything to merit any happiness, any honor, or even kind remem- brance from you."   AIGLEMONT.      161 Amy seemingly heeded not the purport of his assertion, and said, seriously, "I am sure you could not have done anything to deserve dishonor or unhappiness from any one." "How serious you are! I mean to say, Amy, that I am without a profession, without a career, without purpose-save one-and that one-" he checked himself. Amy's heart palpitated fearfully. He would have died to have told her how he loved her-how earnestly, sincerely and stead- fastly he loved her--how her image had been his star--his guardian angel--how she had been ever present to him, by his sick bunk in the loathsome forecastle, speaking to him in his fever dreams, in his delirium-his last thought on the brink of death! He would have told her all this and more-but his soul's chivalry for- bade him. What had he to offer in return for her priceless love and wealth of beauty? What was he? A penniless rover, uncouth, unrefined, and she?-a maiden, rich, "Framed in the prodigality of nature," and sought by thousands.  No! he would   &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7896-00000082"/> 162   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE, struggle with his passion; he would renounce all hope, leave, and try to forget her. All this sped through his mind, while Amy walked by his side, pale and silent. What he would have said we know not; for at this moment Loo joined them, much to their mutual displeasure.   CIIAPTER XIV. TUCKER'S ON THE ROAD. THE bout between Rock and the "Cove of Cork" had taken place. Wishing to avoid a description of the contest, we will merely state that, at the third round or so, the Cove," elastic as a Bilboa blade, struck out skillfully with his right, and, as it is styled in the playful imagery and airy diction of the ring, "drew the cork," which compliment his grateful antagonist returned by a buffet that fell on the unlucky "' Cove" like the sledge of Thor.               foul by This latter blow was pronounced "foul" by the referee, but exception being taken to his decision, a scene of savage tumult ensued. The rabble engaged in a " free fight," and a promis- cuous, impartial, and large amount of business,  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7896-00000083"/> 164   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. in the fancy line, was consummated in a very short space of time, until all had received their due share of the amusement. The result of this affair created much dissen- sion and bitter feeling among those concerned. The partisans of Rock declared the decision un- just, while some even hinted that their cham- pion had sold himself, and purposely given the foul blow. The stakeholders were placed in unenviable positions, and found themselves the objects of crimination and attack. Many  brawls and affrays were the consequence. The police made several arrests, and some of the participants were held to trial, but it ended as prosecutions against such individuals always end. Their friends levied contributions from prominent politicians, who gladly subscribed to release such valuable janizaries from durance. The "Cove," however, was, through some negli- gence, convicted and imprisoned; but the Gov- ernor, at the intercession of a particular friend (who pocketed a handsome bonus for his influ- ence), immediately rectified the error, and set him- free.   TUCKER'S ON THE ROAD.    165 Edgar Page, being a loser, was, of course, among the dissatisfied. Besides a large sum as backer, he had laid right and left on his favor- ite. Since the battle, he had gathered, from various sources, good reasons to suppose that Jeffers had tampered with Rock. Satisfied that his suspicions were correct, he sought to tax him publicly with his baseness; and an alterca- tion ensued, shortly afterwards, that turned them into deadlyv enemies. It occurred at Tucker's. Tucker's, or, "The Half-way House," is one of the many pleasant hostels that line the Bloomingdale road. Two miles, or so, before arriving at the vale of Manhattanville, you- turn off at a circular lane, that leads to the shaded inn. Why called half-way house, we never could ascertain; but godly people averred sol- emnly, as theyheard the roystering on Sabbath afternoons, that it meant half-way to that sub- terrane locality, where, when the temperature falls to "' white heat," Satan, shivering, dons his overcoat, and the satanic stokers grumble for exttra blankets. Nevertheless, it is an agree- able spot to whileaway an hour on a summer's  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7896-00000084"/> 166   THE SPUYTENDUYVEI, CHRONICLE. day.  Trees environ the house; and, at the rear, the green sward slopes to the broad Hud- son. Before you, the noble river glides majes- tically to the ocean's mouth, and the bosky dells and glades of classic Weehawk stretch to the basaltic cliffs above. "Weehawken! In thy mountain scenery yet, All we adore of nature, in her wild And frolic hour of infancy, is met." It was a fine afternoon, and a large number of vehicles were drawn up at this suburban tavern. The piazza was crowded with sport- ing-men, seated in low-back arm-chairs, suck- ing cobblers, or juleps. The conversation ran altogether on the points of the'various "flyers" and " wind-splitters" congregated there. By the bones of Bucephalus! what an absorbing topic this horse-flesh i8! How deep the wis- dom therein, and how hair-splitting the criti- cism! Could a group of virtuosi be more pro- found over a suspected Guido?

Dick, hold the stakes." Jeffers was standing by the bar. "No," said Edgar, "he don't hold my money.") "What's the matter, Ned?" said Jeffers. "Iatter!" said Edgar, indignantly, "I'll tell you what's the matter." "Come, come, let's have a drink over it," said Keyser, to conciliate them; ," what'll you have, Ned?" "I don't drink with him," said Edgar, sul- lenly. "Nonsense," said Keyser, taking him by the arm. "No, I don't," repeated Edgar, "I only drink with gentlemen."   TUCKER'S ON TIIE ROAD.   169 "Let him alone, Jake--he's drunk," said Jeffers, flushed. "No, I ain't drunk," roared Edgar, pushing the butcher aside; "I ain't drunk, I know what I'm about, and I know what I mean to say to you!" Despite his assertion, his glazed eye, and thick utterance bore strong testimonyagainst his sobriety. Jeffers emptied his tumbler, and turned to leave the room. Edgar caught him by the col- lar as if to detain him. "Hold your horses, Dick Jeffers! Face the music; I want to speak to you." Jeffers shook him rudely off. "Don't bother me." Edgar stood before him to block his way. "I want to give you a piece of my mind. I want to tell you my candid opinion of you. I consider you a king-cheat-a scientific swin- dler-an artistic pickpocket-a thief--a--" Jeffers' aquiline features were incandescent. "Go away!" said he, with a forced laugh.

Edgar, shaking his fist in the gambler's face. "No, I'm not crazy, but I've been robbed, I've been swindled by you! Yes, you! You black- leg, shark, and scoundrel!" Jeffers struck him, and sent him reeling. He gathered himself to attack Jeffers, when his companion with the sharp face and Keyser seized End held him. "Let me go, Jake," screamed Edgar, wrest- ling and struggling. "Let me get at him. Let me kill the thief!" As the volcanic snow-cones grow black be- fore an eruption, so Jeffers scowled- "Take the drunken beast to bed." As he reached the door, he turned, shook his finger at Edgar, and said- "Mind, my man, I'll pinch you for this!;' and his eye gleamed cold and cruel as a dirk- blade.   CHAPTER    XV. PRODIGAL DAUGIITER. FANNY, repentant and heart-broken, arrived at her father's house. It was early, but the servants were astir. Her mother's heart filled with joy. Her father, raising the postulant with his usual serene benignity, said, "Our daughter, that was lost, is restored to us, let us kill the fatted calf," and-went to break- fast and buckwheat cakes. The imperturbation of that man! wearing the same unruffled face on all occasions. His power in smouldering the fires of indignation or damming the floods of joy was wondrous.- Like aquafortis, his anger burned oilily and flameless. His prayers were lip-prayers, with- out fervor, without heart. Little Pipps, his errand-boy, said he never prayed earnestly but  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7896-00000087"/> 172   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. once, and that was for a rise in sugars, of which he had bought a large stock on specu lation. When Rackett found his bird had flown, he went directly to Mr. Hyson's house, stormed terribly, and demanded the restoration of his wife. Mr. Hyson sent for a policeman. Rackett left, vowing to institute legal pro- ceedings to recover possession of the " partner of his bosom," who was cruelly imprisoned from him by her parents' malevolence. Mr. Hyson commenced a divorce suit. Rackett's star was setting fast. Shorn of his leonine glory, the houses he had formerly visited were now closed to him. His credit was gone, and he grew a common sponge. During Mr. Hyson's absence from home, he would make periodical visits, and alarm the household by maudlin cries for his wife--his " darling, dear- est Fanny"--until bribed by Mrs. Hyson with a few dollars to leave. Then he would hang around bar-rooms and ale-houses, awaiting an invitation to drink or dine from some acquaint- ance.   He would ask the loan of a dollar   173 PPODIG'AL DAUGTHTER.  from a man he had never seen before, or half a dollar, or a quarter, and accept even a six- pence. He would pop on Alf. Dilly, for in- stance, at the St. Marc. Behold Alfred in his " rooms" (an eight by ten bed place and a closet for boots and clothes), in his dressing gown, before the mir- ror, brushing last night's curls out of his hair. A step on the landing, and Rackett enters. ,'Ha! Alf., my boy, glad to see you. Sky parlor this, eh? Quite a journey to get up. Got anything to drink?" "Ring the bell," said Alf. Brandy is brought. "There ain't overmuch room  here," said Alf., "but I'm snug. See-fine prospect over the square. With an opera-glass, I can see the girls in Miss Megarey's school." "O, you rogue!

She fell in love with me- A glorious crea- ture-big and plump, and a bust like Juno! When about to go home, I was tight as bricks; forgot all about Kitty; insisted upon escorting Miss Smith home.  Her fther, mother, and two sisters were with her.

After we got along a little ways, I took out a cigar, lit it, and began to smoke. 'Doesn't incommode you, ladies?' says I. 'Oh! not at all,' says Miss Smith; but the old lady began to cough. I smoked away; she coughed and coughed, till she nearly broke- a blood- vessel. Asthmatic, I suppose." "Ho! ho!- ho! pretty good," roared Rackett, helping himself to more brandy.

HASSAN, TEE WATER-CARRIER. EDGAR fell sick from the effects of acon- tinued debauch. He was removed from the city to his mther's country house,  here kind ministrations and change of habits prevailed over disease. It left himn debilitated, but he was well enoulgh in a short time to amuse himself in driving the Mambring mare to New Rochelle, Pelham Bridge, and other surround-. ing localities, pelting along the roads like mad, riding over obese geese, brushing with competing "flyers," or lounging in tavern bar- rooms  playing " crack-loo  ," for drinks.  He was so seldom at home, and his continued presence there was something so unusual, that he was seemingly a stranger. Edgar loved his mother and sister Amy; but his   IIASSAN, THE WATER-CARRIER. 179 tastes being so uncongenial, he always felt bored in their society. With Arabella he hardly ever exchanged a word; each seemed absolutely to ignore the other's existence. Now he found an agreeable companion in Ben Coutant. This latter fellow, though he had courage- ously determined to fly from the vicinage and obliterate all thoughts of his passion, still, like a silly moth, continued to circle around the altar flame. Each visit he resolutely vowed should be the last; and again-and again- was this vow broken. Since Edgar's arrival his visits had grown fearfully frequent; but fortunately, or unfortunately, Edgar taking a strong liking for him, was constantly drawing the poor fellow 'off on some pleasure excur? sion or other, much to his- disappointment, and, we may add, Amy's also. As for this young lady, she began to imagine that Ben regarded her with indifference, and grieved silently in consequence. It was not singular that Amy should retain a pleasant remembrance for the object of her child-love; but it was remarkable that the  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7896-00000091"/> 180   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. impression should retain its pristine freshness during a lapse of years-during'the transitions of thought and aspiration, iricidental to ad- vancing summers. Yet there was nothing in Coutant likely to secure the affection of a high-bred girl, like Amy. His uncouthness and ignorance of the elegancies of life, should, on the contrary, have provoked the smiles of one whose charms com- manded the homage of a host of shining cava- liers. But Amy turned in distaste fi'om the offensive adulation--the vapid compliments of lacquered men-to the natural mind, the bold spirit, and frank truth of her rough lover. Hers was the strong sympathy of sense. She was not what is commonly called accomplish- ed. She neither read Metastasio nor sang Mle. Chopin's romances; but sihe possessed the refined taste that loves the simple--the beautiful-the good.  If Ben lacked the more delicate traits of perception, his intellect was stamped with rough-hewn sense, and his large heart beat with earnest truthfulness. His awkwardness was invisible to Amy, and when it called forth the witticisms or remarks of /   HASSAN, THE WATER-CARRIER.  181 others, her indignation was aroused in his behalf. One evening she was much dismayed at his appearance. There was nothing terrifying about him, however--no blood-no alarming looks: it was simply his hat! His hat! the reader inquires, how so? Know, then, unsophisticated one, that dur- ing the height of the California fever, each adventurer to the auriferous region, found it absolutely necessary to provide himself with a peculiar kind of soft felt hat: this was the first item of outfit--the nest-egg of future fortune;-the six-shooter and jack-boots were next in order. Amny saw the symbol, and her apprehensions were immediately excited. "Are you going to California?" said she. "Well," said Ben, with a sickly smile, "I don't know." The- humbug! He had courageously come to bid them all farewell, and now, at the junc- ture, like a craven, hesitated. " Ben,'may I ask you why you would go?" said Amy.  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7896-00000092"/> 182   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "To acquire what I never can acquire here," said he. "What is that?" inquired Amy. "Why, fortune, wealth, riches." "So you could acquire riches there?" "I may." "O, you may. Well, supposing you suc- ceed; what would you do with them?" "Spend them, I suppose." "You will be very happy in doing that, no doubt." "I don't know," answered Ben. "Really, Ben," said Amy, attempting a laugh without her heart, " you seem to be proceeding with very vague and indefinite ideas of what you are about. You say you may acquire wealth, and if so, you do not know whether it will be of any use. Is it worth while 'going so far merely to acquire uncertainties? Could you not tempt fortune nearer home?" Amy flushed: she recollected, suddenly, that perhaps she was too eager, and was going too far. Poor Ben, however, had not perceived it: he was too ignorant of woman's nature to no- tice how her heart controlled her lips.   HASSAN, THE WATER-CARRIER. 183 Amy assumed .a careless air. "Did you ever read the story of ' Hassan, the Water- carrier?'  "The little hunchback, do you mean, who was strangled by a fish-bone?" "No, you will not find it in the Arabian Nights. It is in a little book of Louisa's. If you have nothing better to do than listen, I will read it to you." Amy got the book and commenced to read the story of HASSAN, THE WATER-CARRIER. "Once upon a time --" ("Be a little more'definite in your dates- or I shall hardly believe it to be true.") ("( Stop and you shall judge.) Once upon a time, there lived in Bagdad a poor water-car- rier, Hassan by name. Having a family of many children and being a man of'large affec- tions and forethought, it became a constant source of anxiety to him, what provision he could make for them in case he should sud- denly die--" ("He should have gone to the Bagdad Life  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7896-00000093"/> 184   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Insurance Company, and insured his life," in- serted Ben. "If you interrupt me in this way,I shall not read the story, and you will lose its excellent moral." "Not for the world-proceed.") "One day, while filling his skins from a spring in the outskirts of Bagdad, he was sur- prised by a brilliant cavalcade, who were traveling citywards. The   procession was headed by a tall, venerable man, with- a long, white beard, and mounted on a jet black courser. The pearl-embroidered trappings of the horse, and its gold mouth-piece, attracted Hassan's admiration. It was the grand vizier, Mustapha Zengis, who was proceeding to the espousals of his son with the princess Floribel- zodora, daughter of the Kaliph. Hassan stared at the procession. Such a profuse display of riches he had never before beheld. Even the attendants were attired in vestments of the costhest fabrics, and Nubian slaves, in tissues of silver and girdles of gold, carried gorgeous vessels, containing untold treasures. The blaze of splendor was blinding; and poor Hassan,   HASSAN, THE WATER-CARRIER. 185 who stood like a blockhead, dazzled by the cor- uscations of precious stones, and astounded at all this pomp, was rudely pushed aside by a fierce-looking black, with an immense scimitar. Hassan gazed after the retreating train, until it had vanished in the distance; and thenj re- membering it was noon, he performed his ablutions, and, like a devout Mussulman, prostrated himself towards the tomb of the Prophet. After eating his frugal meal of dried dates, and quenching his thirst at the spring that bubbled up from a huge rock, his mind re- verted to the scene he had witnessed, and he began bewailing his lot in such terms as these: "' ' , Allah! it seems to me that thy slave is unjustly treated; that his lot in this world is beyond endurance. Behold, I beseech thee, those mighty men who have just passed me, as a lion does a dog! What undue abundance is theirs, whilst I can barely procure the necessary sustenance for my existence and that of my children! How seemingly unrighteous to me, when I think, that simply the stone which adorns the vizier's dagger--in his eyes a bau- ble-would suffice to shield me and my children  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7896-00000094"/> 186   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. from want forever, and also enable me to dine every day on roast kid and pistachio nuts!' thinking of a dish he was remarkably fond of, for it seems as if selfish desires will intrude, even in our best intentions. Thus he continued, rending the air with his lamentations, when suddenly-" "A genius, in a cloud of smoke, sprang from his dinner-kettle," interrupted Ben. --"A little old woman, wrinkled and gray, hobbled from some unknown place. She peer- ed queerly at him from her weasel eyes, and said: 'My son, console yourself; I have heard your complaints, and believing them just, I wish to make you happy and contented. I will grant you whatever wealth may be found on the earth you may think necessary to accom- plish this. But remember, you shall have but the quantity you first wish with which you must always remain satisfied, and on no account will I grant a second wish, or augment-your portion. Consider well. How much do you need?" ("Ah, that's always the way with those fairies; there's always some awkward pro- viso.")   HASSAN, THE WATER-CARRIER.  187 "Hassan was overjoyed, and was about to bawl out quickly for the priceless ruby on the vizier's dagger, when, luckily, before the words had escaped from his mouth, his wish included all the jewels in the procession; then again, quick as a flash, his ideas arose to all the wealth of the kaliph; then, as rapidly, to all Bagdad; and, as his desires augmented, encompassing all the world, he was nearly, beside himself with excitement. "'Come,' said the fairy, impatiently, 'speak quickly; I cannot waste all my time with you.' "'Patience, good dame,'- replied Hassan, coaxingly, while he set his wits to invent some method whereby he could overreach the fairy, and not only obtain all the possessions of the earth, but also secure all solar and lunar trea- sures. 'Well,' said he, at last, slowly, as he saw the fairy would wait no longer, ' I think- I'll take-I'll take-I should like to have this spring continually flow gold, and I to possess it solely.' ( ' Hassan, you are unreasonable; there would be no end to your wish. I told you  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7896-00000095"/> 188   THE SPUYTENDUYYEL CHRONICLE. that you must. name a limit, which you can never exceed. But come, take a spade, and follow me.' She led him to a neighboring thicket, and, pushing aside the bushes, showed him a stone tablet and ring, inserted in the ground. ' Raise this stone,' said she, I and be- neath it you will find an exhaustless store of wealth. Take what you need; but mark, the instant you are satisfied, or you lay aside the spade; the stone will cover up the treasure, and all the powers of earth cannot remove it. Re- member!' Hassan stooped to raise the ring, and exposed to view a surface of gold and sil- ver, interspersed with precious stones. He turned to thank the fairy for her generosity, but found she had suddenly disappeared." ("On a blue cloud, I suppose, waving a star- tipped wand.") "Hassan brought his skins, and filled them. 'Now,' thought he, ' I'll throw out a lot more, and carry it off at my leisure.' As he worked, he found he uncovered richer treasures. His eye glittered with covetous joy, and, bearing in mind the fairy's warning, he clutched the spade tightly, and delved vigorously on. Up he   HASSAN, THE WATER-CARRIER.  189 threw ingots of gold and sequins, coins of all kinds, and rare stones; showers of diamonds and sapphires; amethysts and onyxes, rubies and opals; then necklaces of immense pearls, each worth a kingdom. Poor Hassan, as he scattered these jewels through the air, was un- dergoing a singular transformation. From a man of simple nature and affectionate heart, he had become suddenly exacting, and fearfully athirst for riches. His very lineaments had changed; his features had sharpened, his eyes protruded, and a yellow tinge overspread his countenance. It seemed, as he toiled on, as if the fairy had changed him into the demon of avidity. By throwing up the gold, he had piled two large mounds on each side of him, and had also, consequently, sunk some distance beneath the surface. Still, on he dug, more furiously than ever; his energies and greed increasing as he dug. Night came, and still found him at his work. The moon-shone over him; the stars winked and blinked at each other, as much as to say, What an insatiable wretch! nevertheless, on he continued, as if he meant to pierce his way to the antipodes. At  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7896-00000096"/> 190   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. last nature could withstand the strain no longer, and his efforts grew weak. He began to feel the pangs of thirst and hunger, yet he still cast up feebly the ingots and gems. He raised his eyes while working. The hills of trea- sure were very high, and he was down very deep. There was an incalculable amount of wealth there-still would he have one mnore spade- ful-just one-and another-another-now he would stop; no, but one more-one more; thus he thought, promising himself that each should be the last, and dreading each time to relinquish the spade. At last his fainting frame refused to second his will, and he sank down exhausted. The spade fell from his unwilling hands, and he lay panting at the bottom. What was his horror, now, to find the monstrous mounds of treasure slowly crumbling upon him! He tried to call for assistance, but the stream of coin filled his mouth, and choked him. His writhing was useless. On-on- rolled the frightful mass of metal, crushing and grinding him beneath its ponderous weight, and, last of all, the stone tablet moved to its, place, and sealed him forever in his grave of gold."   HSSAN, THE WATER-CARRIER.  191   "I perceive the moral," said Ben ; " but I am not much afraid of such a death befalling me. I am no at all alarmed at finding as rich ,placers.' Still, the story is apt. Gather- gather - clutch - hoard - and to-morrow we die!" With such - arguments did Amy demolish his flimsy resolutions. We are easily dissuaded from any distasteful project, and Ben, delight- ed at this evidence of Amy's interest in his welfare, exclaimed at last, "M]inerva again," and tossed away the California hat. The next day he replaced it by a broad palm- leaf, and cradled three acres- of his fathers wheat before breakfast.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7896-00000097"/> CHAPTER XVII. MR. HAMMERSLY MX. DURING the canicular heats, 31r. Hammers- ly Mix had been yachting, fishing, and bath- ing, in the bright waters of Narragansett bay, and flirting in the corridors of the Ocean House, Newport. As the hegira of fashion commenced, he be- thought him to seek repose in the umbrageous quietude of Throgg's Neck; and enjoy halcyon hours in the society of Miss Amy Page. The Harlem cars deposited him, his carpet- bagr and hat-box, at Williams' Bridge; from whence an antique carry-all conveyed him to Mrs. Page's residence. Arrived there, and finding the door hospita- ply open, he went in, without announcement. The first room on the right was the library,      *- :?.J    MR. HAMHERSLY MX.    193 and as he entered this, the skirt of a dress vanished through an opposite door, and a chair rocked violently from the spring of a recent occupant. This apartment, library, ante-chamber, or by whatever name designated, was smart in green and oak. Over the mantel hung the coat of arms of the Spuytenduyvel family in all the pomp and circumstance of gules, or, and azure. Unskilled are we in the noble science of ar- moury, and therefore unable to enlighten the reader on its composition, but, whenever a visit- or entered this room, Mrs. Page invariably in- formed him that the mullets ,az., on field or, were conferred on her ancestor,Vly van Spuyten- duyvel, surnamed the Sleepy, for doughty ex- ploits performed in the service of Philip of Burgundy.  The learned visitor doubtless re- memberins the famous factions of the Kavabel- jauws and the Hoeks--the Cods and the Hooks --that distracted the land of dykes for so long a period, by their conflicts in settling the mo- mentous question, as to whether the codfish took the hook or the hook took the codfish. The Hodks subsequently espoused the cause of 9  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7896-00000098"/> 194   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. the fair Jacqueline, but Vly the Sleepy was a prominent codfish and partisan of Philip of Burgundy, who munificently rewarded this faithful adherent with the three mullets azure.* After this explanation Mrs. Page fails not to add: ', Of course we quarter the arms of Cour- land, as you see." Then will the complaisant visitor, with a sapient stare at the escutcheon, respond: , O yes," when, it's a hundred to one he don't know a chevron from a wyvern. To while away the time until somebody came, Mix took up a book that lay open on the table. It was ," The Whitewasher," a new novel, written by a young lady of fifteen, and which, in the words of the critic of the "Glean- er," '" displayed the profoundest and most in- timate knowledge of the world, and the keenest research in the mysterious workings of the human heart."  He had got greatly interested with old Gumbo the fresco-painter, when little * Hence; all those of the Knickerbockers, whose ancestors took sides with the Kaabeljaws, are styled the "Codfish aristocracy."-SMTH'S Peeragre of America.

Mix, ain't it?" "How did you find that out?" said he, sur- prised. "O why, I saw Aunt Effy run up stairs as fast as she could go, and she bawled out, "Mix is here." You see she wasn't dressed up, and her hair wasn't fixed-nor nothing. She don't like to see company when her hair's not fixed. She'll be down again soon, I think." "Aunt Effy, who is she?" inquired Mix. "Why, Aunt Effy's my aunt. Don't you know Aunt Effy?,  Don't you know Miss Euphemia Page?" "Oh-ah, yes. The lady with a beautiful head of hair, thick braid, curls, and all that." 4' Yes," said Loo, " and she's very particular about it, too, and puts it away in a green box, every night, before she goes to bed." "Ah indeed," said Mix.

I do believe, it takes her six hours to dress. How long does it take you?" "Umrn--well," commenced Mix, a little puz- zled at this candid young lady; but at this mo- ment a rustling of silk on the staircase luckily interrupted the alarming disclosures, and Aunt Euphemia bounded lightly in. She stopped suddenly for an instant, like a startled fawn, then drew up her eyebrows and tripped archly towards him. "Why! Mr. Mix," said she, holding out both hands. 4( How-do-you-do. What a delightful surprise. Why how long have you been here?" O, unconscious Aunt Effy! what a trap for polite fibbers hast thou fallen into! ;- I have been here but a short time," said Mix. "This young lady has been entertaining me.' "That's my niece, Miss Louisa," said Aunt Effy. "Ah! I was unaware that Mrs. Page had so young a daughter." "But where have you been? You are such a stranger. Hasn't it been shockingly warm weather?",   MR. HAMMERSLY MX.     197- i "O hideously so. How did you survive it? Positively, I have lived on nothing but straw- berry ice for six weeks; breakfast, dinner, and tea." "Well, what is there going on in the world. We're quite cloistered here. Do tell me every bit of news you can think of." "I have been sporting with Nereids in the foamy brine of Newport, but gladly resign them for the fascinating Hymadrads- of this rustic re- treat." "Now, that's elegant indeed," said Aunt Effy, clapping her hands gleefully. "But what news do you bring from there." Mix related the latest gossip of the watering- place, gave an account of the attempted elope- ment of Miss Z-    , with the ophicleid( player of the Germania band, which was frus trated by one of the hotel boot-blacks; an( drew a droll picture of Miss X--, the Balti more belle, in her Leghorn flat, and flounce( Turc-satin bathing-dress, trimmed with Honi ton lace.

"Where is Miss Amy?" inquired Mix. "She has been spending the day at a neigh- bor's, but I expect her home every moment," replied Mrs. Page, at the same time going be- hind Mix, to draw down a window-shade. "She's in the poultry-yard, feeding the chickens and pigeons; she-" -Loo stopped suddenly, on catching her mother's eye; for that majestic lady was making the most fright- ful facial contortions from behind Mix's chair. Putting on a smiling mask, she said, "Amy is such a singular being. She will leave her Ger- man or Italian at any time, to amuse herself with some trifle or other." Which was not at all surprising, when we recollect that she was totally unacquainted with those languages. An instant after, the young lady alluded to made her appearance, and, to her mother's great alarm, in her plain white muslin dress and sun- bonnet; but Amy, like the sensible girl she was, was not in the least disconcerted nor ashamed of her attire, but quietly rodded to   MR. IIAMMERSLY Ml. 19 Mr. Mix, as if he were simply a gentleman, and not Mr. Mix, the elegant beau, with fifty thou- sand dollars a year income. As the good girl threw off her large, white sun-bonnet, she dis- played that happy face, all a-glow with Hygeia's badge; and a blushing track across her white throat, showed where the enviable bonnet-rib- bons had pressed. Mix gave the killing glance. ' Miss Amy, ever the same ;" and he took the tips of her fingers. A shade of discontent passed over her coun- tenance. Tea was announced. As Mix entered, Arabella, from her easy chair, inclined her head with her customary coldness, and the widow introduced her son, whom he had never seen before. Amy was unusually silent during the meal. Aunt Effy monopolized the conversation, and rattled on with volubility. "Fond  of fishing, Mr.  Mix?" inquired Edgar. , Y-e-s-I do a little that way sometimes." , Fish bite sharp now, off the Point, I under-  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7896-00000101"/> 200   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. stand. Shall we try our luck to-morrow, if it's favorable? What say you?" "O, yes!" shouted Loo.  "Let's all go a-fishing." "If the ladies would accompany us?" said Mix. "If it's not rough on the water, and you will all promise not to rock the boat, perhaps I will consent to go," said Aunt Euphemia. "And so will I," exclaimed Loo. "That will be very agreeable. And will you go, also?" said Mix, appealing to Amy. "I can hardly say," said she. "O, yes-she'll go," said Ed(gar. "I will speak to Ben to-night about getting Cluppin's sail-boat. She's a handsome, comfortable. little yacht, and will bowl us along finely." After tea, they took chairs and sat on the piazza, to enjoy the evening breeze. Two visitors called. One was Dr. Coyne, the village physician-a middle-aged gentle- man, who seemed particularly engaged with Arabella-the other was Ben, who brought a small box under his arm, containing a sixteen- keyed accordeon. Mix stared at him. There   MR. HAMMERSLY MX.    201 was something in his rough, hearty manner, grating to fine-strung nerves. He was sur- prised to observe Amy treat the fellow po- litely. Edgar sat with his legs on the balustrade, eftuming like Stromboli. "Please don't smoke, Edgar," said Amy. "Must smoke, Amy, to keep the gnats off. I say, Ben, we're bound on a fishing-excursion to-morrow-want Cluppin's Lively." "I'm on hand," said Ben; and they arranged the preliminaries. Then Ben took his accordeon from its case, at the request of the ladies, and favored the company with the choicest of Mr. Christy's melodies, dwelling especially on "O, Susan- nah!"-an interesting female, who was pathetic- ally, and yet picturesquely represented with a buckwheat cake in her mouth and a tear in her eye. The curtain of night drew gradually o'er the scene. The panorama before them was mag- nificent.

In the far distance, a light-house revolved its lamp, like a burning star! "' The beacon's crimson, rolling eye,' " quot- ed Aunt Effy-, how emblematical of our transitory lives! One moment illumined by joy-the next, obscured by sorrow. "Very," said Mix, who was wondering who the deuce Ben could be. "What a night for meditation!" continued Aunt E. "How one feels the awe and majesty of nature's grandeur. ["Yes, and the mosqui- toes," added Edgar, sotto voce.] Still, I have never felt so impressed as I did at Niagara. There, one drinks in deep draughts of inspira- tion at every breath. How I should love to visit Switzerland-Tyrol! to sail on Leman's bosom, beneath the walls of' Chillon; to gaze on the cloud-piercing glaciers, and cross to sunny, fatal-gifted Italia!" "Yes," drawled Hammersly, who thought he had stumbled on a pun, " the glaciers of Switz- erland are fine, but I prefer the, ices of Italy." "  O, for shame!" exclaimed Aunt Effy. ,I But did you go to Egypt!"   MR. HAMMERSLY MX.    203 "I--yes, 'I strolled that way," answered Mix. ( O, I should dearly love to go to the cata- racts of the Nile, up the Blue Nile, or Pink Nile-which is it?--and live on lotus-buds! How delightful it would be!" "Yes, the pyramids are quite remarkable productions, and there are some superior mum- mies; but the fleas are annoying." "O, horrors! Mr. Mix, how can you?" "Better stay at home, Aunt Effy," inter- posed Edgar, " and live on lettuce. It will make you just as drowsy, and it's a great deal more agreeable. I say, Ben, this is slow. Play up. Let's have a little more music." The obliging fellow took his instrument, and strained out "Oft in the stilly night"-a little wheezingly, to be sure; but you could easily recognize the tune. "Kellay set ome?" said Mix to Aunt Effy, partly to display his French, and partly that the others should not comprehend the ques- tion. Aunt Effy blushed slightly.  She, did not understand.

"Mr. Coutant," said she, to change the conversation, "can you play 'Come e genteel,' the serenade from Don Pas- qually, or one of Schuberth's'noctlo-nes?"Ben could play neither the serenade northe nocturne; but he gave them "Wood up" with surprising effect. After having played this lively air five or, six times, he commenced the dulcet ballad of ' What fairy-like music!" Mix retired to bed. He had no ear for music. Amy would have listened all night. "Now, Ben, spin us a yarn,old boy. Shake- speare-ain't it?--says, you fellers that go down into the ships to sea, do see a great many wonderful things in the briny deep-eh?" You must remember that our friend Edgar's scriptural knowledge was exceedingly lim- ited. "Do, Mr. Coutant," said Aunt Effy, " do tell us something romantic-some fearful tale-in- troduce a stiletto, an orange-grove, and a Donna Inez-do, now." 'I have nothing romantic to tell you," re- plied Ben.   MR. HAMMERSLY MX.    205 "Then, tell us something horrible, something that will make our hair stand on end like the quills on a fretful porcupine. That will be so lovely." "I don't think such a result would improve your looks, Aunt Effy," said Edgar. "Neither can I tell you anything very hor- rible, as I never even witnessed a murder, but I will relate a little incident that occurred to me in London. When I first expressed to my father my desire of going to sea, he, thinking it was but a passing whim, said I had better go on a short voyage at first, and recommended me to a friend of his who commanded a Lon- don packet. This did not exactly satisfy me, as all my dreams were of the South Sea Isl- ands, so that on the arrival of the vessel at her destination,I ran away,and endeavored to obtain passage on board of some Indiaman. During my stay in this metropolis, as I had a little money, I determined to see all the notable sights. I rambled in those immense parks that constitute the chief beauty of this vast city-stared open- mouthed at the elegant equipages with their plushed and aiguilletqd footmen; went to the P  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7896-00000104"/> 206   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIIRONICLE. Tower, and fed my curiosity and imagination with thewonders of this ancient strong-hold. There was so much here to gratify the student of novels-the armor that locked valorous knights, the antique weapons, the instruments of torture, the headsman's axe and beheading block, Traitor's gate, that recalled chilling hor- rors of the rack, and the rat-infested dun- geons below the moat. Then I went to St. Paul's, coiled myself up in the copper ball that caps this vast pile, and descended to the cool crypt, to stand beside the grave of Nelson. When visiting the Abbey, and lounging be- neath its groined roof, I took a lesson in the expensive school of experience.  I was ad- miring the statuary and reading the inscrip- tions, when I was attracted by a casual remark from  a gentleman seemingly engaged like my- self. He was a middle-aged man, of genteel appearance, and I was soon led into a conver- sation with him. His observations were really very interesting and instructive. We came to a satue of Wilberforce. "Ah!' said he, ' look at that countenance. How expressive! What benignity, what good-   MR. HAMMERSLY MX.    207 ness is there imprinted! How true an index to the owner's character-to the overflowing goodness of his heart. Notice the mild pla- cidity of those features! What guileless in- nocence and- child-like simplicity have we here. The very attitude denotes the quiet repose of a pure and affectionate mind, affec- tionate not for one only, but for all-his vast heart grasping the human race in its all-com- passing love. Ah! I could have worshiped that man if I had known him-yes, I could have died for him.' \ "I respected my newly-found friend for these beautiful sentiments, and began to enter- tain great esteem for him. I said I thought so, too. "'Yes, sir,' he continued, ' that man holds a place in my esteem far greater and higher than prince, poet, or warrior ever can. What need of monument, of "(   storied urn or animated bust," erected to the memory of such a man. How superfluous. No, sir!

My young friend, fashion your life on such a model-fashion your life on such." "What an eloquent man, thought I, and what a heart he must have. Wishing to say some- thing, I told him: 'I am a stranger here, sir.' "' Ah' said he. "'I have only been here a week, I am an American,' I added, wishing to impress him with this important fact. "' Ah, indeed, from the States. Allow me to congratulate you, sir. A great country, and a great nation that-a young giant, fresh with youthful vigor. The sap is rising there. You should be proud of your birth-place.' "' I am,' said I with importance. "' I would that I were an American-a mem- ber of that glorious confederation where every man's a sovereign, I should value my citizenship beyond a dukedom.' "Sensible man, thought I. "'But see,' he continued, 'here I am in my native land-alone in this great city--without   MR. HAMMERSLY MX.    209 friends or acquaintances. Of what benefit or use to me is Magna Charta, or Bill of Rights? I am a sea-captain. Three weeks ago, I sailed from Liverpool for Antwerp. While in the Channel, we were wrecked (here his voice fal- tered), and my eldest son, my darling boy, was lost (he turned to brush away a tear and hide his emotion), and probably when his mother hears of it-and I dread to communicate this sad news to her-it may break her heart. I am here without a penny, I dare not write to my family in Liverpool, for fear of the anxiety the letter would cause, and I wish to broach the mournful intelligence myself, but I am en- tirely without the means of getting there. It is but a trifle to be sure, and I would gladly repay it a hundred-fold, on reaching hlome, but, being without friends, what can I do. How- ever, why'should I sadden your' happy heart with the recital of my misfortunes. Heaven shield you from similar misery! Let us talk no more about it,' he added, as if wishing to change the'subject.

"' If you think, sir,' I ventured, ' that a small sum of money, enough to pay your fare to Liverpool, could be of use, I will let you have it.' "'No, would you!' he exclaimed joyfully, and grasping both my hands. 'My dear, dear fellow I how kind, how noble, how generous of you, and how blessed your parents must be in the possession of such a son.' "My heart expanded. ' How much is it?' "' Only twelve and six,' he answered. "I gave him the money and he again grasped my hands, and exclaimed as the tears bedim- med his eyes, ( Bless you, my dear boy! Hea- ven will-record this noble act.' "4I glowed with reckless generosity, and could have lent him a pound. "' Give me your address,' said he, taking a small memorandum-book from his pocket, 'so that I may remit you the sum immediately on my reaching home, with an additional amount as a slight recompense for your kindness, and   MR. HAMMERSLY MX.    2" my wife will add some trifling jewel, that I beg y6u to accept as a small token of her grati- tude, for your unbounded- benevolence.' "I don't want any reward,' said I. 'I merely do what any one would do in my place.' "' My dear fellow, you must accept of some mark of my esteem-you must really, I should be very unhappy if you did not. Now promise me you will.' ,' Rather than pain him, I promised, and gave him my address. "' Here is mine,' said he, and handed me a slip of paper on which he had written: Capt. Andrew McClure, No. 13 Paradise rotw, Brydges street, one door above the Bold Benbow Inn- Liverpool. ' And when you go to Liverpool, don't fail to call and see us, by all means. Now, say you will,' and he shook my hand heartily. "' I will.' "' Now, my dear young friend, you have been so kind and generous to me, that I don't mind opening my heart to you.

It seems as if there were a bond of sympathy between us, in fact,' he said, with a burst of con- fidential affection, as if you were my son.' "He was again deeply moved as he said this, and I expected some horrible revelation. "'Yes, I am not ashamed to tell you what I would scorn to confess to any one else. My dear young friend,' and he struggled with his pride, 'I have not tasted food for two days, I feel weak and faint.' "'Good gracious,' said I, staring at him. 'Why didn't you tell me that before,' and I hurried him out of the Abbey, and into the nearest tavern. Here he smothered his sorrow with a beefsteak and trimmings, and drowned his grief in a pot of porter. After this per- formance, he acknowleded in a meek voice, that he felt better.' I was pleased with the man's delicacy, in foregoing to mention his physical wants while thinking of the misfor- tunes of his family, and forced him, when leav- ing, to take a sandwich in his pocket, which he accepted with much reluctance, having been already, he said, too great a participant of my excessive liberality. We shook hands, and I   MR. HAMMERSLY MX.    213 left him, with the pleasing consciousness of hav- ing performed a good action-at no ultimate cost. "Three days after this occurrence, while visit- ing the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, I was astonished to see my friend the Captain, lounging about and admiring the pictures. I went to him to seek an explanation. He affected surprise, blandly denied having ever seen me before, said I must surely be mistaken in the person, and-coolly walked away. I was vexed at being duped in this way, though, after all, I suppose it was a just punishment for permitting selfish motives to prompt my charity; for, without the bait of being refunded, most probably I would not have lent him the money." You may depend upon it, Amy did not be- lieve a word of that last assertion.  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7896-00000108"/> CHAPTER XVIII. PISCATORY. WHEN Hammersly appeared the next morn- ing, he found Edgar on the lawn busily en- gaged with rods, floats, snells, etc. "You're not going that way, I hope, Mix?" said he, pointing to the other's apparel. Mix was in varnished pumps and striped silk stockings. " O, I've nothing on to spoil." "Yes, but any way, you'd better put on a pair of thick boots and get one of the girls' flats or hoods," said Edgar. "4 Come, I'll rig you." An early breakfast was prepared. Amy was not present. "Where's Miss Amy?" inquired Mix. "She's not going," answered Loo.   PISCATORY.       215 Mix was greatly disappointed. They started; Edgar and Nip, the colored boy, going ahead with baskets and tackle. Mix stumped along in heavy boots, Aunt Effy by his side and a wide umbrella over them. He objected to wearing a girl's hood. Arrived at a small stone jetty, they found the little yacht moored. Ben was awaiting them. He, also, was disappointed. "Come, jump in," said Edgar. "We must make the most of this tide." Mix, Aunt Effy, and Loo were deposited on the cushioned   seats. Ben took the tiller. Edgar pulled out his cigar, case, and Nip elongated himself on the lee side of the jib. "Isn't this lovely!" exclaimed Aunt Effy as they glided out of the placid cove. "The might and majesty of the ocean! How forci- bly is one reminded of Byron's beautiful lines." And she quoted: "'O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea, Our thoughts as boundless and our souls as free. Far as the breeze can bear the billows' foam, Survey our empire and behold our home!

Pitching her shrill voice, she began the appropriate song of "A life on the ocean wave," and the musical Ben chimed in the chorus bass-ly. [What is it gives people such an inclination to vocalize when on water-parties?] They were sailing along the lee-side of a neck of land that jutted into the Sound. As they rounded the point and came into open water, they found a rough sea on.   Then the   , music ceased instantaneously, and Aunt Effy, clutching the gunwale nervously, assumed an anxious face.  "Mercy! what's that?" said she, as a wave danced playfully in and filled her lap.

Edgar and Loo laughed somewhat rudely. "Don't be alarmed, Miss Page," said Ben. "There's not the least danger." But Aunt Effy was not so easily reassured. "Let us return, Mr. Coutant-do, please-we shall all be drenched to the -skin." "I think it would be more. prudent, for the ladies' sake," added Mix with a sickly smile. He was beginning to feel very pale, oscilla- tory motions being incompatible with his bili- ary temperament. Ben immediately put the boat about and began to beat back. They ran  in to the shore and landed Aunt Effy, Mix, Loo, umbrella, and lunch-basket. Edgar and Ben sailed back to the fishing-grounds. Terra firma and a sandwich restored Mix's diaphragm to equanimity, and he proceeded to extend his elegance beneath a shady but- lO  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7896-00000110"/> 218   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. ter-nut. Not a consistent position, we must observe, for one who discoursed so enthu- siastically about yachts and yachting at New- port. Aunt Effy and Loo amused themselves by sitting on a rock and patiently holding baitless hooks in the water; until the boat returned. Edgar and Ben exhibited a long string of fish as trophies of their skill. All reembarking, they proceeded homewards. Dinner was awaiting them. Half-famished they fell to with the voracity of " forty bears." "Why, Mr. Mix," said Mrs. Page, "how sunburnt you are." "I will give you some cream. It's the very best thing in the world," said Aunt Effy. "Pshaw!" said Edgar, "it will give you a healthy color, Mix." Hammersly ran to a mirror. True enough, his face was red as raw meat! . The reflection of the sun's rays from the water, had scorched his thin skin a fiery hue. He was in despair! He went to his room. Aunt Effy sent him a bowl of cream. Locking the door he plastered it over his face an inch thick. It trickled into   PISCATORY.       219 his ears and eyes-over his hair and moustaches. Thus bedaubed he paced the room in vexation.

A cup of tea and some toast was brought to him. Then he threw himself on the bed, and as he lay, tossing in a fever of torment and chagrin, he could hear from below, Amy's rich bubbling laugh, and the ,4 infernal"' accordeon of that " clodhopper," Ben. ^ -  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7896-00000111"/> CHAPTER XIX. DELIA DAHLIA--LOO PAGE. MR. HAMMERSLY MX'S first impulse, on awakening the next morning, was to wash off the cream from his face, and run to the looking- glass. The inflammation was allayed, but the tip of his nose was scarlet. Imagine, elegant reader, how annoying to a person with a shapely white aquiline, to have it swelled to undue proportions, and flaring like a drunkard's beak; at a time, too, when he needs all the resources of grace and beauty. With despondency sinking his soul, he de- scended to breathe the fresh air, and revive his drooping spirits. It was early, but Aunt Euphemia was in the   DELIA DAHLIA-LOO 'PAGE.   221 garden, trowel in hand, horticulturally em- ployed. "So early, Mr. Mix?" said she, on espying him. "Yes, I come to breathe a little fresh air." "Your face looks much better this morning." "Think so?" said he, gratified. "Dee-cidedly-a little redness here and there -nothing of any consequence.  But you're very matudinal for a city gentleman, are you not?" (Aunt E. was very correct in her pro- nunciation, screwing her u's in the orthodox style; therefore, she said " machewdinal.") She rattled on. " O, I do so love the de- lightful morning air! to attend at nature's levees-when the birds are at their toilets shaking ( from their little throats such floods of delirious music,' and when earth's jewelry glitters in the rising sun. Come hither," said she, in an airy Delia-Dahaish way, and taking his hand with child-like simplicity. "Come, T haven't shown you my garden yet-there- that's mine. Laid out under my sole supervi- sion. What do you think of my taste?" "Elegant-elegant," he murmured.  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7896-00000112"/> 222   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Do you really think so?" said she, looking into his face with middle-aged archness. "I call it-Flora's hearth-rug. No attempt at a pun, I assure you. Our gardener has so little taste in these matters-men do not, you know, generally appreciate flowers, but I idolize them; so I thought I would lay out a portion of the garden to suit myself. I like a due observance of the rules of taste. Instead of jumbling lil- ies, carnations, verbenas, and coxcombs, in one promiscuous confusion, I prefer a pleasant and judicious contrast; so you see, I have planted that gorgeous, blushing rose, amid a snowy circle of malapert lilies, and that heavy, drowsy poppy is relieved by winsome pinks. Here-let me fasten one of those gaudy little fellows, in slashed velvet doublet, to your but- ton-hole-there-now (giving him a gentle accolade), I dub you my most faithful and valorous Knight of the Slashed Carnation," and she laughed ripplingly at the merry conceit. "She's in love with me-that's evident," was Mix's inward reflection. "She's not exact- ly pretty, but she certainly is a woman of superior intellect."   DELIA DAHLIA--LOO PAGE.  223 "Are you poetic?" continued Delia Daha. "I mean, are you a pre-Raphaelite in poetry- do you cull your honey from Mount Hymettus -sip nectar from the fountains of Castalia, or trammel your thoughts to beaten paths; drive Pegasus on the turnpike, as I may say, or stroll with the winged charger to untrodden solitudes. Do you read Wordsworth?" "H have a fine copy of his works at home. An Oxford edition, elegantly bound!" "I love the Lakists above everything. I adore nature." "And I adore woman," returned Mix, gal- lantly. She tapped his hand playfully with her trowel, to punish him for this audacious re- mark. "Now, don't smile," said Mix, "and murder while you smile." "Pshaw! nonsense. Do you call Amy pret- ty?" said she, changing the topic. -"She re- minds me so of Evangeline." "Yes-I should say she was pretty," said Mix; "but who is this individual you -call Ben?"   &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7896-00000113"/> SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. " Ben Coutant ? 0, Ben is the drollest crea- ture-he's not very good-looking, but he is so good-natured and obliging."  Some women cannot mention a man without a comment on his looks. "How is it," inquired Mix, "that we don't have more of Arabella's company ?" " Arabella's unwell, poor child; I feel so sor- ry for her. She's a source of constant anxiety to my sister-in-law, and, indeed, to all of us. But she's so amiable and sweetly resigned. She would really be a treasure to any man." The breakfast-bell interrupted their colloquy. It was an unusually dull meal.  Mix's nose passed the ordeal of observation without pro- voking any remark. Neither Arabella nor Louisa was present. Amy, who did the honors, was trist, and her eye-lids seemed red, as if from weeping. Aunt Effy endeavored to enliven them with her sprightly chat. Mix eat with a good appe- tite, being greatly relieved at Arabella's ab- sence. He was always uneasy in her presence, being intuitively aware she disliked him. It seemed as if he were constantly read by her     DELIA DAHLIA--LOO PAGE.  225 basilisk eyes, and the gaze laid on his soul. Why she was absent, and why Amy looked sad, we must retrograde a little to explain. After returning from the fishing-party, Louisa ran to Arabella, to relate her adventures. When she had ended, she added, "I suppose Amy would have gone with us, if it hadn't been for that Mix." "Why, what makes you think so ?" inquired Arabella. "0, because she don't like him," answered Loo. " How did you become so wise, miss ?" "I know: and besides, she's in love Ben Coutant, and Ben Coutant's in love her." How do you know ?" " Well-she listens all the time he plays on the accordeon, and she looks pleased when he comes; and he thinks there's no one in the world like her; and -" "Stuff and nonsense !" ejaculated Arabella. You're always making such wonderful dis- coveries. You always imagine every one's in love with Amy." &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7896-00000114"/> 226   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. I don't think every one's in love with you, at any rate," retorted Loo. "Hold your tongue, miss!" said Arabella, assuming the tone dictatorial, always highly offensive to her youngest sister. "I won't," answered the little vixen. "Go out of the room this instant, you impu- dent little hussy!" said Arabella. "I'll go when I please," said Loo ; and draw- ing towards the door, she ran out, crying, "Try and catch me, cripple!" Arabella turned white. "You imp! I could tear you in pieces!" and the words issued be- tween her teeth, vicious as an adder's hiss. This cruel taunt threw Arabella into such a rage, that the reaction made her ill. She was put to bed. Mrs. Page boxed Louisa's ears, and ordered her to be immediately taken back to the Priory. Then she sent for Amy. Little Loo, with childish cunning, had dis- covered that which her mother, with all her worldly tact and experience, had not even thought of. Amy went to her mother's room. They were alone. A   DELIA DAHLIA-LOO PAGE.   227 "Amy," said her mother, "Amy, can it be possible that you have given any encourage- ment to this young man-this Coutant?" "I- Hmother-"  Poor Amy blushed scar- let. Mrs. Page read the answer in her daughter's face. "I am astonished! I never should have be- lieved it!" said Mrs. Page, sternly. "That you should so far forget your position-that a daughter of mine should demean herself, by as- sociating-by receiving the addresses of a-low -vulgar-person!" Amy stood, with downcast eyes and heaving bosom. A pause. "However," said Mrs. Page, relentingly, "I will forgive you, this time; but you must not see this person again. I forbid it. Now, Amy, I wish to have a little reasonable conversation with you. Whatever I say, my child, you are well aware is solely for your own happiness. You are young and inexperienced-liable to fall into those silly, romantic, and dangerous ideas, that so many young people entertain. Your presumed wealth, my daughter, will con-  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7896-00000115"/> 228   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. tinually make you an object of designing- -scheming-adventurers, from whom I want to protect you ; and I also wish, that my daugh- ter, when the proper time arrives, should con- tract a marriage suitable, in every respect, to her birth, family, and education." Mrs. Page spoke of birth like " the daughter of a hundred earls," and held a mechanic in as much contempt as a Guelph would have held her. She continued: "Above all things, bear in mind, Amy, that what I advise is wholly for your own benefit. I have always found you a dutiful daughter, and I hope you will always remain so. Be more circumspect-more select in your society. Such a person, for instance, as-Mr. Mix, I would not object to in the least. He is a gen- tleman of education, good family, and-wealth. No one could find a more desirable acquaint- ance. I am afraid you have been somewhat distant and reserved towards him. This must not happen again. It is sufficient that Mr. Mix is my guest, to entitle him to all pos- sible cordiality and friendship, from all my children. Remember, Amy; and I hope I   DELIA DAHLIA--LOO PAGE.   229 shall not have occasion to find fault with you again." In the solitude of her chamber, Amy gave vent to the pent-up sorrow of her full heart. It was not her mother's determination in regard to Coutant that caused her the keenest grief- for she cherished a shrine of love that none could eradicate, and where she could worship, even were the object far away. But her sensi- tive mind shrank from the true interpretation of her mother's counsel. The command to en- courage Mix's attentions was too repugnant to her maidenly soul. Hence the sad eyes, and Arabella's absence.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7896-00000116"/> CH APT E R XX. THE MAMBRINO MARE. MR. H. Mix had not entered upon his de- signs against Miss Amy Page's heart with any "serious intentions." He had no idea of proposing for the girl's hand; no thoughts of marriage ;-in fact he was not a marrying man: he was a male flirt, and meant it all for pastime; to gratify his vanity-to add one more to the hecatomb of hearts sacrificed to his irresistible charms. He came-he saw-she conquered. And we find Mix entangled in his own snare and ready to lay his heart and fortune at the feet of his enslaver. He had not, as yet, had an opportunity of declaring his passion; Amy having avoided him as much as possible. This he attributed entirely to maiden bash-   THE MAMBRINO MARE.    231 fulness. Could he but obtain an occasion to prosecute his suit; to put his formidable tac- tics in play-his batteries of delicate praise- his exquisite, touching compliments-his skill- ful engineering in the art of courtship would, he doubted not, soon reduce the citadel to capitulation. Such an opportunity at last presented itself. Edgar had often desired Mix to ride behind the Mambring mare, and try her paces. But the 'latter, not relishing the company of the former individual, had uniformly excused him- self. Edgar having gone to town, Mix, one day, had the mare harnessed and invited Amy to accompany him in a ride. Amy would unhesitatingly have refused; but a look from her mother forbade her. Up by the door the buggy was drawn. The nag, a trim little animal, delicate as a Cordo- vian palfrey, stood between the thills pawing the earth with her small, round hoofs. Amy stepped into the vehicle. Mix, elate and happy, was soon by her side. He drew the reins over the mare's back, and she glided away with the rhythmical gait of a practiced trotter. It was  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7896-00000117"/> 232   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHtONICLE. towards evening, and the sun had lost his fiercest rays. They' drove along a shady road skirting the Sound. The light breezes were fanned into coolness by their velocity of flight. Mix thought he had never enjoyed so delight- ful a drive. The exhilaration of rapid riding, heightened by the musical ring of hoofs, and, above all, the presence of the handsome girl by his side, filled his cup of joy to overflowing. Amy had never appeared so charming to him. She had gradually thrown aside her look of chagrin and yielded to the influence of scene and moment. The graceful candor mirrored in her face., mingled with an expres- sion of pleasure sparkling in her dark eyes. Sing not, ye bards! of the passion-lit orbs of Roman girls; praise not the liquid black- ness of Moorish maidens' eyes; insipid are, they, by the true, clear flame, radiating the summer-lightnings of a soul robed in fearless innocence and purity! "How lovely the scenery--how exquisite- how grand!" said Mix.   THE MAMBRINO MARE.    233 "Very," said Amy, drily. "Can anything exceed the transcendent, the superfine beauty of this landscape?" "Nothing," responded Amy, in the same tone. His companion's taciturnity weighed on his spirits. To shake it off, he indulged in a rhap- sodical burst:-"What a glow of delicious, sensuous joy thrills through every fibre of our being, in such moments as these! The nerv- ous emotion of reining a gallant steed; the intoxicating enchantment of rural scenery, and last, though not least-no, not the least by a jugful-the pleasurable society of a charm- ing - fascinating-- lovely - beautiful - girl." He paused an instant to obs6rve the effect; but Amy was looking in another direction. He resumed. "The country, without doubt, is the proper home of lovers. Love scenes are always laid amid shepherds, sheep, dells, and groves. Natural emotions among Nature's works.  One can't imagine fresh, genuine affection existing amid the conventionalities of fashion. Love in cities becomes an exotic. I was always pastorally inclined. I have a remarkable taste for bucolics."  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7896-00000118"/> 284   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Amy was picturing in her mind, Mix as an Arcadian, with crook and oaten pipe. She is evidently drinking in my words, thought Mix. I must follow them up. "Do you remember those exquisite lines in the Lady of Lyons, where Claude depicts to Pau- line his fancied palace on the borders of Lake Como? They are so pertinent and beautiful." And he recited for at least the fiftieth time, to as many different young ladies, the well-known lines commencing: "A palace lifting to eternal summer Its marble walls from out a glossy bower Of coolest foliage, musical with birds Whose songs should syllable thy name!" etc. When he came to the concluding words, "Dost thou like the picture?" he tenderly added, " dearest Amy!" and strove to encircle her jimp waist. She shrank as if a reptile stung her! her face flushing and lip trembling with maidenly anger. Confound it! thought Mix, what have I done? A long silence en- sued. "Miss Page," ventured he at last, " have I trespassed; have I vexed you in any way? If   THE MAMBRINO MARE.    -235 so, it is entirely unintentional, and I beg most sincerely to apologize, as I regret it very, very deeply!" She replied not, but her breath came quick and her eyes filled. Mix-felt abashed, and knew not what to say. Having gone a considerable distance from home, he proceeded to return. They continued to ride in silence, and were about half-way back when clouds gathered and it grew suddenly dark. Noticing these signs of an approaching shower, Mix drew up the leather apron to protect themselves. In a few moments, large leaden drops came pattering down, which rap- idly augmented to a pouring rain. Suddenly a vivid sheet of lightning illumined the gloom, followed by a terrific clap of thun- der. The horse, startled by the cloud-mine, reared an instant, and then, with a spasmodic spring, shot off like bolt from bow. Mix was frightened. The road was a good one, but one side led along an abrupt descent, and it was pitch-dark. He clutched the reins with all his power, wound them around his arms, and braced himself against the dasher.  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7896-00000119"/> 236   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Amy was silent, and the lightning's glare showed her motionless as a statue. On, on they sped, with the fleetness of wind! An- other quick flash rived the blackness; the mare neighed with terror, baulked--an axle snapped, and they were thrown violently out. The mare darted wildly off with the shat- tered vehicle. Mix, unhurt, sprang up and sought Amy. He raised her; she seemed in- animate. He spoke to her, called her by name; but received no answer. The rain on her face, he mistook for blood, and a feeling of inconceivable horror chilled his pulses. Distracted, he ran to seek aid. Not far from the spot, he beheld light gleaming through some cottage window. Taking Amy in his arms, he hurried frantically towards it. Beat- ing in the door, he laid his burden on a chair and hastily explained the accident. The wo- men of the house employed all their means to resuscitate her. There was no wound visible, and she seemed merely to lay in a swoon. Without waiting longer, he ran, half-crazed and drenched to the skin, to acquaint her family.   CHAPTER XXI. THE SAGE OF TUCKAHOE. Two visitors at tea that evening. "Mr. Wrexem--Dr. Coyne," said Aunt Effy, introducing these gentlemen to each other. Mr. Wrexem-Mr. Emmanuel'Kant Wrexem -often styled the " sage of Tuckahoe"-is a metaphysician, and a friend of Aunt Effy's. As he is popularly estimated to have been born a century or so too soon. we will describe him, to give a faint idea of what the human race will be a hundred years hence. His general aspect is pale-pale face, pale hands, pale eyes, and pale hair, the. latter brushed out of all regu- larity over a stupendous forehead. When Dr. Coyne waq presented, he held out a limp hand,  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7896-00000120"/> E SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. stared at him through his spectacles, and said, "Aw!"He is always in the clouds, flounder- ing in the Infinite, tacking about from Cause to Will, splurging in a sea of Monads, Categories, Harmonies, etc., or communing with the shades of Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, the Schoolmen, and all the other Titans of Thought. In the mighty laboratory of his brain, he triturates tomes, and sublimes apothegms of such compact wisdom, as would give an ordinary mind a brain fever to comprehend. "A seeker-great mind-oon espree for," whispers Delia to the Doctor. "Look at his head. Ideality sticks: out like a door-knob. Did you hear him lecture last winter?" '. No, I believe not." "You must-I will lend you his 'Age of Pewter.' Always in a reverie-a forger," she added, tapping her forehead with her finger. Doctor Coyne was a little bewildered at this last remark, not knowing whether she meant to allude to the metaphysician's being a black- smith, or to attribute to him a propensity for counterfeiting tokens, when she cleared the mystery, by explaining that his caput was the   "forge of thought," which it undoubtedly was, and from whence he hammered out ideas of the lucidity and density of horse-shoes. Cards were proposed. This was the only amusement Arabella could indulge in. Aunt Effy and Mr. Wrexem were partners. What affinity could exist between Arabella and Doctor Coyne-both so frigid and satur- nine? You would as soon imagine two amor- ous icebergs. "They are your cards, I believe, Mr. Wrex- em," said Delia. "Aw--O-pardon!" said Wrexem, recalled from a dialectical combat with the spirits of Duns Scotus, Puffendorf, and Abelard. You should have seen the metaphysician shuffle the pack. This occupied fifteen minutes. Then he dealt, beginning with his -right-hand adversary. "The other way, if you please-elder hand first," said Delia. "Aw-a-yes-thanks."   He recommenced. When half through, he stopped, and gazed in- tently at the centre of the astral-lamp, mutter- ing to himself: "Spinoza is wrong-decidedly.  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7896-00000121"/> 240   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHIONICLE. In dichotomizing the soul, we certainly find the diadroms omniform." "( Apples of gold in pitchers of silver," whis- pered Delia to the Doctor. The metaphysician slowly resumed deal- ing. M' is-deal," said Arabella. "O --excuse -I-- Mrs. Page interposes: "; Can I offer some re- freshment, Mr. Wrexem? A little raspberry vinegar?" "Thanks--thanks; a little cool water, pure and simple, I prefer." "Your play, Mr. Wrexem," from Delia. "I was oblivious "-he trumped his partner's trick. Delia was a little annoyed. The metaphysician was again ruminant. A glass of water broke the meshes of transcen- dental webs. "Thanks-thanks-sweeter than hydromel. Cleopatra's draught of dissolved pearls was acrid; but the thirsty Bedouin quaffs liquid diamonds at the desert oasis. ("Recep- tivity" was wide awake, however.) Behold the hydatides! Tsi the Hylozoic, believed them capsulated souls of sprites--"   THE SAGE OP TUCKAHOE.    241 "We're to have a famous soprano next sea- son, I am told-a Signorina Frezzolini, from la Pergola," broke in Mrs. Page. "The Thomists assert that the sacred tooth of Bhudda--" "Third hand high, if you please," said Delia, somewhat vexed at perceiving that, though her partner might be an excellent metaphysician, he was but a poor whist-player. "How fearfully it storms! I am very much afraid Amy and Mr. Mix will be caught in it," said Mrs. Page. "They may, probably, stop at some ac- quaintance's house until it abates," said Aunt Effy. "You have revoked, I believe, Mr. Wrex- em," said Arabella. But Wrexem was off in China, wrangling with the ghost of Confucius. He was about opening his mouth, intending to regale them with a brief dissertation on the oddic force in con- junction with Mantchoo philosophy, when a plaintive neigh arrested their attention. "What can be the matter?" exclaimed Mrs. Page. "  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7896-00000122"/> 242   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Dr. Coyne sprang to the window. He could see nothing through the gloom. The coachman, Patrick, now entered the room. "Please, madam, here's the mare with broken pieces of the wagon. I'm afraid some accident has happened to Miss Amy." How depict the consternation this announce- ment produced? Mrs. Page's cheek blanched, and her hand trembled; Aunt Euphemia grew hysterical; poor Mr. Wrexem was flapped back from China; but Arabella was silent; she ut- tered no word of surprise or alarm, and-God help her!-for a moment, a gleam of diabolical joy danced in her cockatrice eyes. Dr. Coyne followed the coachman to the stable. Holding up the lantern, they beheld the mare standing in her stall, her flanks beat- ing, her eye dilated, and her open nostril swell- ing with fear. The shattered shafts had torn her slim legs; and her satin skin and neat fet- locks were bloody. As the coachman patted her soothingly, her intelligent eye grew calm, and she became tranquil. "What can have become of them, do you suppose, Patrick?" inquired Dr. Coyne.   THE SAGE OF TUCKAHOE.   243 The man shook his head. "I hope nothing; but this looks bad indeed, sir, in this storm." The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Mix, ghastly and wild, rushed to them. "O good God! quick, get the carriage, the horses-harnessed, quick!" "What's the matter, man-what's the mat- ter? Is she dead?" "O no! no! no!"Mix gasped out. " O, I'm a villain. It's my fault-my fault." The carriage was speedily prepared, and they drove furiously to the cottage where Amy had been left. They found her restored to consciousness, but in great anguish. She was suffering from a broken limb. Mix never forgot the spectacle; how she looked in her soiled garments; wet and bedraggled; her white face, bloodless lips, and wet tresses! They laid her on the carriage-cushions and brought her home. Mix slept but little that night. He re- proached himself for the accident and felt abject, guilty, when he thought of his cow- ardly, insulting behavior to an innocent, un-  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7896-00000123"/> 244   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. offending girl. The coxcomb had a kind heart beneath his embroidered vest. When morning dawned, he descended qui- etly from his room and slunk away, like a thief, from that house, never to return.   CHAPTER    XXI I. AMBS-ACE. AMY was out of danger and rapidly recover- ing, when, one evening, Mr. Roosevelt came hastily up from the city. He evidently had something of importance to communicate; for he was in a state of great perturbation, and without any of his urbane formality, asked to see Mrs. Page at once. When that lady appeared, he rose nervously towards her. "Mrs. Page," said he, "1 excuse my abruptness and--don't be alarmed, I beg of you." "For mercy's sake! Mr. Roosevelt, what has happened?" said- the lady, clasping her hands in apprehension. "Now-now--don't, I pray you-don't be  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7896-00000124"/> 246   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. agitated, my dear Mrs. Page. Do calm your- self, I beseech you." "But what is it, Mr. Roosevelt? Don't keep me. in suspense any longer. What is it?" said Mrs. Page impatiently. "Yes-yes-well. It's nothing at all-- don't be alarmed--such things will happen- (Mrs. Page stamped her foot)-well-well- the fact is-Hy'son has failed!" , Well," said Mrs. Page, somewhat relieved, "what then-what of that?" "Why, the firm of Hyson &amp; Co. having failed, it may involve--mind, I say it may involve a portion of the estate-a portion of your property." "You don't mean to tell me that!" said Mrs. Page, sinking back in a chair. ( You don't say that?" ,' So I fear. I was informed of the failure yesterday, and on pursuing my inquiries and investigations, I found good reasons to believe that Hyson had disposed of a large amount of bank and state stocks he held in his name as exe- cutor. How far the villain has proceeded, I am unable to say; but enough is known to make   AMBS-ACE.       247 it certain that you have been mnost infamously robbed and plundered by this man--this vil- lain-whom your late husband held in such high esteem and consideration. ("Good gracious! Mr. Roosevelt, what is to be done? Am I to be ruined--to be left desti- tute?" said Mrs. Page despairingly. "No, my dear lady. Calm yourself, I beg of you. You have still enough remaining to keep you in comfortable circumstances. Some- thing may be ultimately recovered. I shall set about the task immediately. Meanwhile, give yourself no uneasiness: it may not be as bad as I represent it." This was a sad blow- to Mrs. Page.  She could not spare anything from her income; and to be compelled to contract her expendi- tures, to retrench any of her accustomed luxu- ries, was an awful affliction. Perhaps she would be obliged to forego all city gayeties and resign herself to a droriing country life. - The prospect of such a calamity was terrible, and caused her a cataclysm of tears. Mr. Roosevelt was the worst person in the world to communicate unwelcome intelligence,  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7896-00000125"/> 248   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. and his excessive anxiety to break it as gently as possible, generally produced the opposite effect from what he intended. Like all old bachelors, he dreaded family scenes, and wo- man's tears were a bughear to him. Con- sequently, seeing  the widow  about; to commence lachrymatory operations, he rang the bell violently, and on the appearance of the maid-servant, slipped quietly from the room. iMr. Roosevelt takes a cane chair and seats himself on the piazza. 4"Bad business, bad business," he mutters. Like all men who try to drive away thought, he commences to whis- tle-a thing he had not attempted these thirty years. The whistling is a failure. "Luckily," mutters Mr. Roosevelt again, ," there's a com- petency left--very lucky-very lucky." As he says this, his glance falls on the Sound-on the water. Now, the water, in Mr. Roosevelt's mind, is associated but with one thing--not with brandy, as in Edgar's case, or with ships, as in Ben's; but with fishing. Patrick, the coachman, is passing at this moment.   AMBS-ACE.      249 "Patrick," inquires Mr. Roosevelt, "are there any bass at the bridge?" "Plenty, sir. There never was known so plenty before. Some very large ones was caught there all of last week, sir. Mr. Pell, sir, he caught one a' Wednesday, as weighed nigh a' five-and-twenty pounds; and Mr. Morris, he caught, but yesterday, two fine ones, of twenty pounds each." "Is it possible? Bless me! At the bridge, did you say?"2 "Yes, sir. Mr. Pell, he caught his fish right off the broken buttress." "Really, that's superb." Mrs. Page and the Hyson failure were out of Mr. Roosevelt's head in a twinkling. "What bait did they use, Patrick?" "Shrimp, sir." "That must have been a fine one of Mr. Pell's. Did he play much?" "About two hours, sir. He broke the lance- wood tip, and they thought they'd lost him; but after a while he was so weakened, they managed to land him." Mr. Roosevelt suddenly recalled himself. 1l1 ^  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7896-00000126"/> 250   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "No-no! What am I thinking about? I've more serious business on hand. Let me take my supper and go to bed, so that I may start early to-morrow morning, and pursue this mat- ter of Hyson's." He went to bed, to toss about in that fever- ish, unpleasant condition, when the spinning brain obstinately refuses to yield to Lethean in- fluences, and all the events of the day pass, re- pass, commingle, and transform into all the hues and shapes of a kaleidoscope. It was a mirage of fish and Hyson, and Mrs. Page and Patrick, big bass and bankruptcy, and so on, until, at last, the " tired eyelids closed on tired eyes." It was very early when he awoke; he never slept well in a strange bed. His first thought, on arising, was of the failure; the second was of fishing. "It's a fine morning for fishing," soliloquized he, looking from the window; " a very fine morning, indeed ; and the tide, I think, is about right. I wonder whether it would be indecorous in me to fish, under the circum- stances? I think it would be a little unseemly. No-no! I mustn't do it. That rascal, Hyson!   AMBS-ACE.    -  251 (A pause.) But it really is a very promising morning. I wonder whether I could get bait at Fowler's? Edgar's tackle is in the carriage- house; I can find that easily enough-tut- tut! I'm ashamed of myself, to think of such frivolity, when I've matters of importance to attend to. Five-and-twenty-pounds bass! Pro- digious! And twenty-pounders caught but yesterday!-dooking at his watch). It is very early yet. I wonder if I haven't time to go and have a cast before breakfast? I cannot cer- tainly return to town before ten. I'll go and speak to Patrick." He went to the stable. Patrick soon furnish- ed him with the necessary apparatus; and with a horse and wagon, they proceeded to Pelham bridge. At the bridge-house they luckily found shrimp; and, a moment after, Mr. Roosevelt was expertly swinging his grass line off the broken buttress. "Patrick, I don't think it necessary for you to wait for me; you may return. I shall stay here but a few minutes, and then I will walk back." There he stood, with a glow of animation on e  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7896-00000127"/> 252   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. his good-natured countenance,- watching the float, and thus he remained, oblivious of every- thing else, until late in the afternoon, fascinated by the anticipation of two hours' play with an immense bass tugging at the hook. He did not return to the house ; and when Patrick came to seek him, he was informed that Mr. Roosevelt had gone directly to the city. So it was. On Monday, September the 8th, 185-, the great house of Hyson &amp; Co. suspend- ed payment (the genteel word for bankruptcy). At half-past two o'clock on that day, they were estimated to be worth " millions;" at three o'clock their paper was "lying over" at the bank counters; and, a few minutes after, nota- ries were hurrying to and fro, protecting the acceptances and promissory notes of the stupen- dous firm of Hyson and Company. Their bankruptcy caused the failure of the Munnisunk and Squnkum Valley Railroad Com- pany, and of the Stock Security Bank, of Squn- kum,Valley, Oregon Territory-two valuable corporations, in which they were especially and greatly interested. That gigantic enterprise,   AMBS-ACE.       253 the hunnisunk and S. V. R. R. Co.-which was intended to develop the immense resources, etc., etc.-we have all heard of: the Stock Se- curity Bank was a quiet little speculation, belonging to Hyson &amp; Co., and highly remu- nerative. The bank itself was reported to be situated in the centre of an inaccessible marsh, in Squnkum Valley, Oregon Ter., the cashier of which institution was a deaf half-breed, who responded to all demands for specie payment by presenting a rifle, pregnant with leaden death, at the demander. Under those circum- stances, it was not surprising that bill-holders preferred paying two per cent. discount to Shavem &amp; Cheatem (Hyson &amp; Co.'s brokers) for redeeming them, than undergoing-a trip to the delightful valley of Squnkum, and a call on- the half-breed. The notes, being amply se- cured by pledge of stock, obtained a large cir- culation; but, unfortunately, on examination, the stock was found to be shares in the Munni- sunk and S. V. R. R. Co.; and, as this gigantic undertaking had also failed, and was mortgaged (at a low estimate) for about six times its value, it requires no knowledge of integral calculus  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7896-00000128"/> 254   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. to ascertain that the shares were worth about two cents a pound weight to the paper-makers. Luckily, the bank-bills were extensively dis- seminated among the poorer classes--mechan- ics, laborers, etc.-and, therefore, no one person could have lost a large amount. Edgar was but little moved by the bank- ruptcy, even though he had been informed that a large portion of the estate was involved. He was in town at the time. "Poor mother!" was his reflection. "(I suppose she is greatly affected by it; she could not bear to descend from her position. But what is the use of fret- ting? nothing like taking things easy!" and tossing off a glass of "Hennessey, 1805," he lounged to the Miranda Rooms, to play pool. When he returned'home he found a note, directed to him. It was written in a feminine hand, and conveyed the intelligence that Mr. J. Johnson desired to see him on particular business. "Confound it," ejaculated Edgar, "I had forgotten all about those notes. They're not due yet, either, but I suppose Hyson's smash-   AMBS-ACE.      255 up has frightened the old rascal. Hang it! What's to be done?" The existence of those obligations had com- pletely faded from his memory. His mind, under the influence of strong potations, had become so slothful and hebetated as to be un- able to retain any impression. Now, their recollection 'caused him much perplexity and agitation. He called at old Johnson's. The usurer met him at the door, led hint into a room, and shut the door carefully. "Now, look heah! Mister Page, look heah; what you mean by dis?" and the old man tot- tered towards him, rolling his yellow eye-balls. "Mean by what? what's the matter?" said Edgar, surprised at his impetuosity. "Matter! I tell you : you mean to rob me! Yes, to rob me! Me, an ole man!-I know, I know." "Rob! What do you mean?" exclaimed Edgar, changing color. "Yes rob! steal! cheat!-look, look! I find you out. But I'be got you. I make you pay for dis. You don't rob me, I kin tell you!"  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7896-00000129"/> 256   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. During these ejaculations the old man seem- ed convulsed with frantic rage, and Edgar's countenance became ashy pale. ("But, Mr. Johnson," said he, collecting him- self, " these notes are all right. They'll be paid when due. Why alarm yourself?" "Alarm meself! Yes, how paid? You got no money-not a red cent. What dis name good for, eh? Tell me dat, tell me dat. Never mind, anyhow. I got you, I got you. You rob me wid a forgery, eh? I see dat!" At this last accusation, poor Edgar sank back. An icy dart pierced his heart. He had not realized until this moment the importance, the criminality, of his act. Conscience-stricken, he betrayed himself. "Oh! Mr. Johnson, don't say that," said he, imploringly, " don't say that! Think how dis- graceful. You shall not lose anything, I assure you. It will be all right. Give yourself no alarm about it. I'll bring the money to-day. Oh! don't mention it to any one, I pray you." The old man descended from his stilted in- dignation with remarkable suddenness-from a typhoon to a calm. He said, in his usual tone,   AMBS-ACE.    -  257 "I know bell 'nough, Mister Page, dat your family's a berry 'spectable one. I wouldn't do noffin to disgrace you or dem, ef I could help it. But den, you see, dis is my persition; can't 'fiord to lose anything. I made my money hard, and it comes too hard to lose it. I'm an ole man, I tell you; and den, besides all dis, I don't want to get inter trouble." "What trouble? You can't get into trouble. Take my word, Mr. Johnson, depend upon it you shan't lose a cent. I give you my sacred word of honor." "Bell, I dunno.- It's a great criminal oftense agin de laws, dey say, dis forgery. I don't want to lose my money, and I don't want to get inter trouble. You're a young man ob good co'nections, I know. You're folks is nice, genteel, folks; but den you see how 'tis." He paused. Edgar winced at the mention of his crime, and gazed helplessly and vacantly at the old negro, who scrutinized with unceas- ing vigilance every expression of his counte- nance. "Now," resumed old Jeff, insinuatingly, "you're a kind o' nice young man, and it would i          &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7896-00000130"/> 258   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. be ra'ally too bad for to ruin sich a young feller like you-mus'n't do it ef I kin help it-mus'n't do it." Edgar caught a little hope, and listened eagerly. "Now, I was gwine to say-- You're a sin- gle man, ain't you?" "Yes," answered Edgar, mechanically. "So I s'posed; and you've led a putty wild, rough, sort ob a life, too, I guess, eh? Now, ef you was all right and clar, now, would you reform? Settle down for good and marry, and be stidy, eh? Tell me dat?" "Yes, yes," promised Edgar. '( Bell, now, maybe I'd forgit it all ef you would do dat, kase I only want your good, you see. Ef you'd onney marry some nice gal, wid plenty money, too-you might be berry happy den. I don't s'pose you'd hab any 'jections to dat, eh?" "I don't know, I'm sure," answered Edgar, who had listened attentively, and was amazed at the drift of the conversation. "Bell, to come to de pint. Now I jest tell you dat, I knows a gal-bell, she's my darter-   AMBS-ACE.      . 259 dat's de fact--she's likely--and I tell you, I'll give her 'fifty tousand dollars in good yalla goold de day dat she marries. Dat's de fact." Edgar recoiled as the usurer unfolded his proposal. His soul revolted at the thought, and he would have returned an indignant answer had not the recollection of his position checked the intention. "Now you see what I means," continued old Jeff. "I tell you plainly dar's no nonsense about me. You has your chice. You can eider cut stone at Sing-Sing or marry and make your fortune." Poor Edgar's heart sanka as he heard these propositions, both fraught with disgrace to his family and misery to himself. Nevertheless, he did not despair, reflecting that, perhaps, it was merely a ruse of the usurer's to obtain from him, besides the payment of the notes, a handsome bribe on the score of securing secrecy. "Now, Mr. Johnson," said he, affecting a careless air, "*we understand each other. Come, I'll pay you the notes and make you a liberal present for your discretion in the matter."  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7896-00000131"/> 260   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "No, no," said old Jeff, shaking his head doggedly. "I can't do dat. I'd tole you what I'd do. I got noffin more to say." "Give me till to-morrow to consider. I'll return, I promise you, faithfully. I'll return to-morrow afternoon." "Bell, you kin do as you like about dat. I got de notes and de proof. I ain't a gwine to be cheated out ob my money. Ef you was to run away it wouldn't help you much, I guess." Edgar turned away from the miser's house with a sick heart. A slight fault in its inception, the simple strategy of the moment, had trepanned him into disgrace and destruc- tion. How earnestly he cursed Jeffers, who had suggested the forgery, and then betrayed him--though, in reality, old Jeff. had been aware of it from the first. It is with such maddening emotions that men commit mur- der! But how escape the dilemma? He might fly, but his absence .would only confirm his guilt. He was indifferent to the world's scorn, but he dreaded the shame and humilia-   AMBS-ACE.       261 tion that would bow his mother's proud head, and sully his father's name; for Edgar, through- out his career of dissipation, had always re- tained a strong reverence for his parents. And Amy-his best, his dearest friend-how such an accusation would wound her kind heart. He saw no method of escape. The crafty negro had too skillfully constructed the snare. Yet he could purchase silence, and smother his crime: but how? By marrying this negro's daughter-chaining his life with a being to loathe and despise. But would the expedient be less bitter; would not opprobrium point the finger and sink his relatives to the same depth of shame?  Yet, why should the world know it. Might not secrecy be maintained, silence insured, his fault hidden, and the honor of his family remain stainless?"Of what use am I," thought he, with a bitter groan; "how worth- less a being; what matter if such a vile weed be cast away? Should I hesitate an instant in sacrificing myself, when I can thereby protect innocence and affection, from the consequences of my guilt?"He passed a fearful night.. The black sands of life ran slowly.

It is such awful moments that punish the sins of years. Merciful sleep, at last, wrapped his soul in oblivion. He awoke at dawn, languid, unrefreshed, and alive to his unfortunate position. Punctual to promise, he returned to old Jeff's house. "I have come, Mr. Johnson," said he, firmly, " to accept your proposal. I will marry your daughter. You shall give me the notes and the fifty thousand dollars." Old Jeff could hardly conceal his satisfac- tion. The aspiration, the ambition of his life, was about to be attained. His progeny would not be despised Pariahs-a reviled and ostra- cized class-but, with erect brow and proud step, would enjoy all the privileges the Creator has conferred on his most favored children. The ceremony was to be performed that evening. Old Jeff went to his daughter, and bid her-prepare for the wedding. Bereft by her isolated life of many emotions natural to her- sex, and accustomed to yield   AMBS-ACE.       263 implicit obedience to her father's word, she mechanically obeyed the summons. Edgar, on confronting his bride, became agitated; but, banishing reflection, he assumed a reckless air. Virginia dilated her eyes like an antelope, and gazed on him in wonderment. She was a damsel, no darker than many brunettes, with an eye of night, a dusky garnet- tinted cheek, and ripe, scarlet lips. Her African blood only betrayed itself in the fretted hair, "'Nubian nose, and vertical set of the head and neck. This latter trait, the legacy, perhaps, of some great grand-dame, who acquired it ages ago, carrying water-jars from the Nile. Carrying an amphora on the head, by-the-by, would be an advantageous exercise to intro- duce in our young ladies' seminaries. It would give the pupils an erect carriage and well- developed bust-no insignificant charms. Virginia's face, in fact, was just such as one would imagine peering   through a harem's lattice; coupled with a form undulating as an almee, and plump as an odalisque. A colored clergyman, an intimate friend of r  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7896-00000133"/> 264   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONISLE. old Johnson's, arrived towards evening. The marriage was performed simply in presence of two domestics and the father of the bride, as witnesses--this privacy being observed at the request of the bridegroom, who desired to pre- serve the matter from publicity for the moment. Virginia laid her fingers in Edgar's hand. He awaited the shock with brazen firmness. The old man stood by, garrulously joyful. The binding words were pronounced-they were man and wife. After the minister had retired, Edgar turned to his father-in-law: "Give me those notes; my share of the contract is performed." The old man brought them.   "Dar, me boy," said he, patting him on the shoulder, "you be a good feller; and, I tell you what, you nebber be sorry dat you married my darter, I kin tell you. Edgar snatched the notes hastily from his hand, scanned them carefully, and then, with nervous fingers, tore them into infinitesimal pieces.   CHAPTER XXIII. CAFPE COQUELIOOT. WE need hardly mention that Ben was greatly grieved -at the accident which had befallen Amy, and called faithfully each day, to ascertain the progress of her convalescence. Since Hyson's failure, Mrs. Page exhibited a different phase of manner towards him, and received the quotidien bouquet most graci- ously. The good lady, in her altered circum- stances, reflected that, perhaps, Ben would not be so bad a match for her daughter after all, particularly as Major Coutant, Ben's father, was a well-to-do farmer with a large unen- cumbered farm and a small family. A cogent consideration, also, in Ben's favor, was the improbability of Mr. Mix's reappearance; and another, that a speedy reduction in her family 12 '  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7896-00000134"/> 266   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. circle was most desirable, with her present income, even under the penalty of a mesalliance. Ben was highly pleased at this change of demeanor towards him, and conversed quite pleasantly with the hitherto glacial dame. During one of these interviews, he, surcharged with confidence and brass, inadvertently blurt- ed out his deep, deep admiration for her daughter Amy. Instead of calcinating him on the spot by the fire of her indignation, as he had fully expected, she actually smiled! saying encouragingly, she had, with a mother's eye, long perceived his devoted attachnment! He was astounded and overjoyed. We shall not describe by what sophistical logic the recreant rogue overruled and set aside all his fine, mag- nanimous motives; but merely say, that he impatiently awaited an opportunity to offer Amy his hand and heart. Amy soon recovered. Youth and vigor tri- umph rapidly over physical injuries. When able to rise and walk about the room, Ben visited her. He found her so altered, but still so supernally beautiful. Her figure was wasted to slightness; her full eyes seemed to dilate   CAPFI COQUELICOT.    267 with increased serenity, and the cheek, robbed of its roses, lay lucidly clear by the thick bands of soft hair that tenderly caressed it. "My dear Amy," said her mother after Ben's departure, " our friend Ben improves vastly on acquaintance. Really, he is not so -so -I am very much pleased with him indeed." "Are you, mother?" said Amy. "Why certainly, my dear," replied Mrs. Page. "One cannot form a correct opinion of another at first sight. In fact, I see nothing in him objectionable in any way. He may be a little singular about his accordeon; but that's of no consequence." "I thought you would like him, mother, when you knew   him better," said Amy, re- joiced beyond measure at this change in her parent's opinion. But on reflection, this de- lightful foam  subsided. She  was so well aware of her mother's match-making propen- sities, that she feared this change indicated another plan  for the disposal of her hand. And, though   conscious that these schemes were always prompted by maternal affection, yet how could she ever, without offending  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7896-00000135"/> 268   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. maidenly propriety, tutor herself to accede to them; even when, as in the present instance, her heart was already enlisted in their favor. When they were wealthy, Ben was despised; but- now, in their adverse circumstances, he would be accepted. Never would she lend herself to such a measure. Amy's room was in a wing of the house, the windows looking on the side lawn. It was a neat little nest, betraying in its arrange- ments the taste of a mind replete with deli- cacy and grace. She was awakened the next morning from her slumbers by a peculiar rattle at the window. Thinking it might be the creeping vines rustling against the blinds, she paid no attention. The sound being repeated, she arose and attempted to look out. It being gray dawn, she could hardly distinguish any object; but a moment after, she heard her name pronounced in a loud whisper. Affright- ed, she returned no answer. Again the voice repeated, more loudly, "Amy! it's me-Ed- gar! Come down one moment; I wish to speak to you."   CAFE COQUELICOT.     269 Recognizing her. brother's voice, she hastily attired herself and descended, alarmed at this unusual occurrence. He approached; she step- ped out from the door, threw herself in his arms and looked in his face with apprehensive gaze. "What's the matter, Edgar? what has hap- pened? what brings you here at this time?" she inquired rapidly. "Nothing-nothing," said he, with affected cheerfulness. i"I come at this hour because I don't care about seeing any one but you- there's a letter-I want you to give it to mo- ther. Be careful of it. Now, my sister, I am going away, and--" "Going  away! Edgar? -- What do you mean?" "Yes, Amy, going away," answered he, sadly, " and God knows when I shall see you again." Amy burst into a flood of tears. ^ What for, Edgar? Where are you going?" said she, between her sobs. Poor Edgar's eyes moistened. This was the most poignant of all his life trials. "Don't cry, Amy," said he, the tears com- s?  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7896-00000136"/> 270    THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. ing from his own eyes. "Don't cry, my sister. Kiss mother for me, and little Loo and Ara- bella." He pressed his lips to his sister's pure, candid forehead. A moment after, he mounted his horse and rode furiously off. Amy watched him as he disappeared, and then, with over- laden heart, returned to her chamber. She could  hardly realize  the scene.  Was it a dream? But the letter vouched for its real- ity; and after a renewed burst of tears, she went, bewildered, to her mother, to deliver it. It ran as follows: "DEAREST MOTHER: "I have been entrapped into an imprudent marriage, that I do not wish to acknowledge. Necessity, therefore, com- pels me to leave you. I do not know where I shall turn my steps. Wheresoever it be, I shall endeavor to earn a livelihood in an honest way. I know, dear mother, that you have but little to spare from your reduced income, and I do not expect any aid from you. I do not need it. When I shall have settled in any place, I will write and inform you. Accept my love and remember me always, mother. Think of me and remember me often to Amy, Arabella, and Louisa. "Your ever dutiful and affectionate son, '"E. SPUYTENDUYVEL PAGE." "Misfortunes never come single," said Mrs. Page, throwing   down  the  letter.  "Poor   CAFE COQUELICOT.    271 Edgar. First, I am robbed of my property, and then, as if that were not too much, my son is foolish enough to make an imprudent and improper match. O, my! dear-dear. What shall I do? Hand me my salts, Amy, from the toilet-table." "But, mother, what shall we do? We must not let him leave us in this way. What may become of him? What shall we do, mother?" "O, my dear child, don't ask me. I don't know. Don't bother me, child. I have too much trouble to think about anything. Speak to your aunt, or to Mr. Roosevelt, or to anybody." Believing it useless to argue further with her mother, Amy took counsel with Aunt Effy, and the result, of course, was to send for Ben Coutant. Aunt Effy explained their distress and requested his advice and assistance. "If you would be so kind-Ben. If it would not be giving you too much trouble," added Amy, timidly. If he would be so kind! If it would not be giving him too much trouble! Trouble to him, who would go through fire at her beck.  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7896-00000137"/> 272   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. What irony! He did not say this, however, but expressed his sympathy, and said, it would be the greatest pleasure for him to go to To- bolsk or Timbuctoo, at a moment's notice, to serve them in any way. After mutual consultation, it was decided that Ben should seek Edgar, ascertain his rea- son for leaving, and try to dissuade him from his purpose; if this were not possible, he was to keep him in close custody, if necessary, un- til he could communicate with them. Ben started immediately for town, and went directly to Edgar's hotel; here he was inform- ed that the object of his search had left the previous day, no one knew whither. He was but little acquainted with Edgar's haunts, still he had no doubts of readily ascertaining his whereabout. Knowing his peculiar propensi- ties, he pursued the following plan. Beginning at Union Square he went down, visiting each public-house and restaurant in Broadway. It being but little after noon, these places were comparatively deserted, and the employes were somewhat astonished to behold a man rush violently in, and, with a stare, and a quick   CAFE COQUELICOT.    273 glance around, bolt as suddenly out. Down he went into cellars, sniffing the commingled aromas of lemons, oysters, and brandy; up into billiard-rooms, into an atmosphere of rancid cigar smoke, and hardly rousing the drowsy markers (never wide-awake until gas-light), before he was in the street and climbing the stairway that led to Monsieur Alphonse Phil- libert's hair-dressing and shaving saloon. He scanned the various polls undergoing tonsorial operations. There was Alf. Dilly, subjected to the manipulations of a feeble brigand in a stale shirt and paste breast-pin-who shampooed the little head to the accompaniment of"'Zitti zitti." Not perceiving the sought-for features, Ben darted out ere the feeble brigand could bawl, "Shave-sir?"On he went, entering all the down-town hotel bar-rooms; the Irving House, the Astor, Howard's, etc. Then he stopped at Guerins' confectionery-no success. Ben was somewhat disappointed. Suddenly he re- collected there was yet another well-known dispensary of bibibles where Edgar might pos- sibly be found. A few moments walk brought him to "Coquelicot's." Every one, of course, 12*  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7896-00000138"/> 274   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. has heard of "Coquelicot's." If you want a. potage a la reine, a truffled turkey, or a salmi de becasse, you obtain it there in the orthodox style. Do you want a magnum of true Clos de Vougeot, you can get it at Coquelicot's, at least, if you cannot get it there, you will find it no- where this side of the Atlantic, and he will give you some capital Liebfraumilch in conso- lation. It is a cosmopolitan cafe. Are you a French gourmand, you go there for des petits plats d la ficfon des Trois Freres. If Italian, you find your Naples maccaroni and true Parmesan.

If Patagonian; suprgme d'albatross. N. B. The last three dishes, we perceive by the carte, must be ordered a day previous. Ben entered this celebrated cafe. In the coffee-room he found Frenchmen sitting at the marble tables sipping their absinthe or demi-   CAFE COQUELICOT.     275 tasse. At the bar a knot of German Jews from the neighboring auctions were refreshing, and chaffing bargains. Scraps of polyglot conversa- tion met his ear on all sides. In the dining- room, the white-aproned garqons were hurry- scurrying and ambitious gentlemen were order- ing "feelays" and "so-tays," and insisting on airing their French to the waiter, when that official would understand them much better in the vernacular. Ben made a careful survey of the frequent- ers, but without seeing his man. He was about leaving, when he met an acquaintance of Edgar's, whom he had casually met before, coming down the stairway from the upper story. ("My dear sir, have you seen Edgar Page?" The fellow was a little flushed. He stared at Ben.  a Page-yes, I believe so. He's up stairs-you want to see him?" "I do." "Come with me, then." He led Ben up stairs and into one of the private rooms of the second story. You might fancy yourself in a cabinet of some boulevard  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7896-00000139"/> 276   TIBE SPUYTENDUXVEL CHRONICLE. cafe; the floor in parquetry, waxed and pol- ished; the gilded mirrors, red damask cur- tains, and windows da 'espagnolette. Here, seat- ed around a circular table, were some dozen fellows, among whom  he recognized Edgar. The cloth had been withdrawn, and number- less bottles crowded the board. The company' were all evidently in the seventh heaven of Jean Raisin, and Rackett (who had (" wrung" himself in) sat opposite to Edgar drinking champagne out of a blue finger-bowl. "Allo Ben," cries Edgar stupidly, ' take a chair old feller--glad you come-wai-  waiter--garsong-here, bring a clean tumbler for this gentl'man." Ben merely tasted the wine. He now ascer- tained that Edgar had announced his intention of leaving soon for Europe, and was giving a few friends a parting banquet. Cards were ordered, and the party amused themselves in playing brag at a dollar ante. Ben noticed that Edgar was plentifully sup- plied with gold (old Jeff's Inoney), and was losing  to a genteel-looking fellow, who was the only one remaining sober. Ben resolved ,.f-*. .

This proposal was adopted by acclamation. After the brewing, a lank youth with lay- over collars and hedge-hoggy hair, an incipi- ent politician, who labored under the belief that he resembled the late General Jackson, rose tipsily to his feet. ,' Feller-citizens-" "Hear, hear!" from Rackett.

"Feller-citizens, in the spirit of '76-" ( Rare old spirits that-let's have some," says Rackett.

"Shy a dollar at the beggar, Edgar," said Rackett-" you're nearest the window-and tell him to play a polka and we'll have a dance." The gentleman from Naples, stimulated by this unwonted generosity, ground out his re- pertory, over and over, from Teddy the Tiler to Di pescatore ignobile. Rackett and the General tried the polka- step to the tune of Casta diva; but the time of that piece not being very well adapted to a lively dance, they got confused and fell over the table, upsetting it and burying the Gener- al's head in the dregs of the punch-bowl, with his heels kicking wildly above. This bombilation aroused the house, and a waiter entered the room flourishing a napkin authoritatively; "Monsieur Coquelicot he saze he vill-ze gentlemans no make zo mooshe noise." "Kick the caitiff," bawls Rackett. "Black his rascally eyes."   CAFI COQUELICOT.    279 Monsieur Coquelicot now made his appear- ance, and the bill being settled by Edgar, the party dispersed. Ben dragged Edgar along the streets, fol- lowed by the General, who persisted in ac- companying them. On the way, this youthful politician became dismally patriotic, and in- sisted on making a stump speech to the way- farers. Mounting some steps, he commenced with lugubrious shrieks a harangue composed of hiccups-aegis-palladiums- principles- freedoms-Marathon-eagles -Jefferson -con- stitution-the whole starred and striped and star-spangled most beautifully-until inter- rupted by a preposterously ragged newsboy with a polite hint, conveyed in the'flowery rhetoric peculiar to the class, to "Dry up!" The politician responded to this delicate request to desiccate, by-a magniloquent frown and a hiccup, when a "fellow-citizen" in a red flan- nel shirt knocked his hat over his eyes; from which undignified position he was relieved by a benevolent policeman, who was kind enough to take him under his protecting wing. During this episode, Ben had hurried off  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7896-00000141"/> 280   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. with his charge. It was too late to bring him to Throgg's Neck that evening, and he there- fore decided on taking him to a hotel and remaining until morning. Edgar permitted himself to be undressed and put to bed. Ben laid down beside him, first taking the precau- tion of locking the door and putting the key in his pocket. Unfortunately he slept too soundly; for, on awakening, he found Edgar had escaped. Re- grets were useless, and Ben set forth again indefatigably to the search, determined, should he again obtain possession of him, to carry him home, if need be, in his arms. His ef- forts, however, were destined to be fruitless; for the fugitive sailed the same morning in a steamship for New Orleans.   CHAPTER XXIV. "OVE AND CHTTAGONGS. THE Pages sold their house on the Parade- ground, and passed the winter at Aiglemont. Months had passed, spring had again returned, and still Ben had made no progress in his suit. For some reason or other, to him incomprehen- sible, Amy seemingly shunned his society, and, although the widow was never so kind nor so amiable, hle imagined that, perhaps what he had gained in favor with the mother, he had lost with the daughter. He chafed for an opportu- nity to declare his passion, and ascertain the worst; but, as Amy studiously avoided a tete-d- terte, it was a long time before he could obtain it. At last, Mrs. Page one day ascended to her room, leaving them together in the drawing-  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7896-00000142"/> 282   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. room. Before Amy could find an excuse to retire, Ben was by her side. "Amy," said he, taking her hand. He said this so solemnly, that Amy was alarmed. "Amy, I wish to confess a passion that I have long kept. pent up in my heart. I respect and love you, Amy, sacredly, religiously, and with all my soul!" Her countenance was momentarily tinged with a finer rosiness. He continued in a firm, earnest voice; I wish to shape all my strength and efforts to win your love, and enable me at some future period to attain the end of all my ambition. Will you sanction this? She struggled with her heart. Drawing her hand from his, she shook her head sadly. . "Don't say that!" exclaimed Ben, wildly. "Don't, Amy; let your heart speak." "I must not," said she. It cost her a fear- ful pang to say this. "Why not, dear Amy? There was an in- passable barrier once between us, which I hope does not now exist. I cannot believe I am hated by you. Answer me?" entreated Ben.   "OVE AND CHTTAGONGS.   283 "Don't question me; I cannot explain." His soul was chilled. In a sad voice he spoke: "Am  I presumptuous? Forgive me. I had no intention of " "( O, no! no!" said Amy, her affection bursting all restraint. "Don't pain me by saying that." He read the secret of her love. He was blessed! At this moment, an inopportune footstep near the door sent him scampering to the furthermost corner of the room, where he sat with glowing face, hypocritically staring at an inverted book, when Aunt Euphemia enter- ed. Amy, still agitated, was looking 6ut of the window. "4 O! Mr. Coutant, do come and drive away one of those hideous, ugly, Chittagongs, that has found its way into the garden. Such a fee-rocious one; it stands directly in the path. I dare not pass it. O! am so afraid of them," said Aunt Effy, prettily terrified. "' Certainly, of course," said Ben, throwing down the book. "Where is it?" and, seizing a parasol, he rushed valiantly out to annihilate the brutal and offending fowl.  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7896-00000143"/> 284   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Major Coutant dwelt within a half-mile of the Pages. He was but a militia major, of course, but a man universally esteemed, and who had represented his district with no common ability in the Assembly. He was a widower, with but two children; our old friend Ben, and little Willie, and Aunt Phoebe Davenport--the major's sister-in-law-presided over the household. We find the Major and his son in the barn- yard one afternoon, taking in a load of hay. Ben is on the cart pitching to his father in the loft. We plainly perceive where Ben obtained that resolute, honest look; there it is in the father's face, combined with the beam of wis- dom compatible with silvered hair. The noise of wheels grating to the gate, arrests their atten- tion. "It is Mrs. Page's carriage, father," says Ben, blushing. The Major lays aside his fork and proceeds to the house. Meanwhile, Mrs. Page has stepped from her carriage, and picks her way daintily over the gravel path. Aunt Phoebe comes forth to   "OVE AND CHTTAGONGS.    285 meet her, in an intense state of fluster and apologies. Such an honor! For though they had been neighbors these ten years and more, this was the first time Mrs. Page had deigned to call on them. Aunt Phoebe is much agitated about the par- lor key. The parlor, she informs Mrs. Page, being generally kept locked, on account of the obstreperous Willie. But Mrs. Page is so con- descending, she will even take a seat on the porch bench.  At last the key is found, the window-shutters thrown open, an arm-chair hastily dusted, and Mrs. Page walks in, staring around the room with that pleasant and polite stare, only fashionable people possess. Aunt Phoebe is again profuse of apologies, berating "that Willie," as the cause of the unpresent- able condition of the parlor, and mentioning pies as the reason of her negligent attire.' But Mrs. Page says, amiably, "Don't mention it," and is kind-hearted enough to admire a " tidy" of Aunt Phoebe's workmanship, which com- pletely reassures Aunt Phoebe. By this time, the Major makes his appearance.  He has  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7896-00000144"/> X 286   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. evidently been sprucing up; as he is very hot in the face, very moist in the hair, and displays an amplitude of buff vest, and redundancy of starched linen, which he wore not, whilst pitching hay. The Major, as is his wont, goes stoutly to the lady, holding out a broad palm, in which she places the tip of her glove. "I hope you are well, madam, I bid you welcome," says he, heartily. "Major Coutant, I believe?" interrogated Mrs. Page. "That's my name, madam." "I called-be seated, Major, if you please." The Major had been standing. Not that he was in any way abashed, for queens and milk- maids were alike to him, but from a sense of singular, rustic, politeness towards strange ladies. "I called-hem!-" commences Mrs. Page, with a little diplomatic cough. "I called in relation to the-the peculiar intimacy existing --I presume you are well aware-between my daughter Amy and your son. The fact is, that Benjamin has solicited me for my daughter's   "OVE AND CHTTAGONGS.   287 hand, and before I give my consent to this union, I should of course wish to know if it meet with your entire approbation, and what you would propose doing in case of such an event happening." "Well," says the Major with a smile, "I perceive that the boy has a hankering that way, and, from what little I have seen of the young lady, I cordially approve of his selec- tion. Come in, Willie (this was addressed to a big blue-eye, peering through the door-crack, which vanished at the calD. As for the rest, why, I doubt not, the young folks can arrange their affairs without my interference." "True," says Mrs. Page, " but I have not the slightest idea how Benjamin is pecuniarily situ- ated, and I naturally hesitate before' resigning my dear child to-to-you understand me, Major?" "Perfectly, madam. My son's wife is my daughter." "Exactly--I simply wished to satisfy myself in this respect, deeming it my duty to confer with you upon the subject." "Madam, I leave all in your hands. I am  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7896-00000145"/> 288   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. grateful for your kindness. I hope I may be able to reciprocate. By-the-by, I spoke to Mr. Jones about purchasing your red oxen; has he mentioned the subject to you?" "No, I believe not. I will inquire, Mr. Cou- tant. Good-day." Aunt Phoebe wished to retain the august dame to tea, but unsuccessfully. She said, "you must excuse me," so sweetly, that Aunt Phoebe was partially reconciled to the disap- pointment. She swept grandly down the path- way to the gate, attended by Aunt Phoebe and the Major, and with a majestic nod rode off. Mrs. Page was not so well satisfied with her visit as she might have been. She had not pro- duced that impression on the minds of these simple people she had anticipated, and which was her greatest delight to produce. The Ma- jor was not awe-struck. He did not seem to profoundly appreciate the honor about to be conferred upon him by an alliance with her fami- ly. Ceries, we may- venture to say, that by his ever-present aplomb, and the steady manly way in which he gazed in every interlocutor's eyes-he would have shaken hands with the   "OVE AND CHTTAGONGS.   289 Czar quite imperturbably, and received the an- nouncement of the betrothal of his son with the imperial princess as a matter of common- place occurrence. After bowing off the lady, Aunt Phoebe ran to the opposite neighbors, the Reynolds, to communicate the all-import- ant intelligence, and interchange -opinions. The Major carefully laid aside his Sunday coat and vest, and resumed his wqrk. "So, Ben, I understand that you and Mrs. Page's daughter are likely to enter into part- nership." "Yes, sir," answered the verecund Ben, meekly. "Well, in that case, I suppose we must fur- bish up the old house a little. You had better consult with your aunt about it." l "Yes, sir." "And let me know when the ceremony is about to come off. Toss away, Ben." Mrs. Page, for some private reason, was urgent that the wedding should come off im- mediately. Amy would have preferred to wait a year or so longer, but of course it was impos- 13 ,  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7896-00000146"/> 290   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CIRONICLE. sible to resist the solicitations of her lover, backed as they were by her mother's request. Aunt Effy took great interest in the young people, and undertook to superintend all the arrangements. Mrs. Page also desired that the ceremony should be performed in as simple and unpretending a manner as possible; she not being over anxious either to open her purse, or to display her son-in-law and his family to her ultra-fashionable acquaintances. Aunt Effy ob- jected to this, saying, that as people did not get married every day, it was not unreasonable to allow them a little ostentation on that import- ant event. But as Amy entirely coincided with her mother in this respect, Aunt Effy was obliged to succumb. They were married in the village church at Pelham. An army of the bridegroom's relatives were present. A regiment of Coutants, Le- counts, and Lefevres from New Rochelle, pla- toons of Guions and Gedneys, from Mamaron- neck; Secors, Davenports, Lawrences, Under- hills, Morrises, Pells, Hunters, Motts, Valen- tines; in fact, half the county.

The last-mentioned gentleman was not present. The obsolete aunts were greatly affect- ed by the ceremony, and cried very much at parting with " that dear child," which, consid- ering this was the first time they saw her since she was two years old, was a remarkable in- stance of strong attachment at short notice. Mr. Roosevelt came out unusually fine and gay. He gave away the bride and saluted her with the courtly grace of a red-heeled marquis at Marly; said envy should not prevent him from congratulating his friend Ben, which it did not, until Ben nearly shook his arm off; gallanted the obsolete aunts; toasted the newly-mated couple in a neat epigrammatic speech, wherein he hoped their married life would prove as free from crosses as a Presbyterian chapel; and vowed, in the presence of all as witnesses, that he never would marry any but a Westchester beauty.

Major in an instant, and accepted an invitation from him, to stay a fortnight and explore a new fishing-ground. Amy and Ben acquitted themselves remark- ably well. Ben was too joyful to think about anything or to do anything except to shake hands with everybody. Amy's happiness was tinged with a shade of sorrow, caused by the absence of her brother from her nuptials, and the uncertainty of his fate. Mr. Wrexem, as we have said, was absent. He had accepted an invitation from Aunt Effy on the occasion of presenting her with his translation of Jacobi's von Gottlichen Dingen, and would have honored the wedding with his presence, had not an accident supervened. The facts were these. The Metaphysician, on the day before the wedding, had occasion to visit the city on business. While walking up Park Row cogitating on Coleridge's doctrine of Ideas, his attention was attracted by the loud hammering and bawling of an auctioneer. There was a placard before the auction room announcing a large sale of gold and silver watches. This, by association, brought sudden-   "OVE AND CHTTAGONGS.   293 ly to mind a rendezvous he had at a certain hour. He felt in his fob, when he recollected that he never carried his watch; his wife, owing to his absent-mindedness, having taken it under her sole charge. "How awkward it is to be without a time-piece," thought he. "Let me see, they are selling some here. I will ex- amine." As he entered, a knot of fellows, who had been standing idly about, became suddenly zealous about a watch the auctioneer was offer- ing to competition. "Now, gentl'men, I have to offer you this splendid gold watch and chain. It's a magnifi- cent time-piece-double hunting case-patent extra lever-cylinder escapement-chronome- ter balance-compensating curb-independent second-twenty-six holes jeweled-mlade by the celebrated Roskell of Liverpool, and war- ranted for one year or no sale. Now gentl'men, what am I bid for it (thump), speak quick, or I pass it (thump), no bid." "Five dollars," spoke mildly a gentleman in black, with a white cravat and smooth face, doubtless a clergyman.

"Gentl'men, this is ridiculous," said the auctioneer, sarcastically; , six dollars for such a watch as this! - Why, the chain alone is worth ten times the money. I think you must all be either blind or beggars." "Let me see the article, if you please,". po- litely requested the clergyman. "Certainly, sir, inspect; and if you don't find it as I represent it, I'll return you your money." The clergyman took the watch near the light to examine it. Mr. Wrexem was standing by. They all crowded around making various re- marks on its excellence. "I'll give you  four dollars for the chain alone," said one to the salesman. "No, sir, I can't do it; they must be sold together. They belong  to a poor widow woman, whose husband died last week, and it must be sold at any sacrifice, as she is in the   "OVE AND CHTTAGONGS.    295 greatest want of the money to save herself and five children from starving." "Poor thing!" said the clergyman, benevo- lently, "I'll give you ten dollars." "Ten dollars, ten dollars--" "Twelve," cries green spectacles. (' Twelve dollars, twelve-" ("Fifteen," bids the clergyman. "' Remember, gentl'men, this watch is sold for cash, and for cash only. If you hav'n't the money, you mus'n't bid. Fifteen, fifteen!" The competition between green specs and white cravat became quite spirited, until green specs' last bid was thirty dollars. -"It certainly is a remarkably cheap time- piece," whispers white cravat aside to Wrex- em, " and I would buy it, but, unfortunately, I have not more than thirty dollars about me." Addressing the auctioneer--"Mr. -Auctioneer, would it be infringing upon your regulations or conditions of sale to ask you to accept a de- posit of thirty dollars, and allow me-the neces- sary time to, procure the balance from my residence, in case I should purchase it?"

Must have the cash at any sacrifice. Thirty dollars, last bid?" "It is wonderfully cheap," again whispered white cravat to Wrexem, as he withdrew quietly to the rear. It also struck Wrexem that it was a very low price for a time-piece of that description. But he was very sharp. "Is it gold?" inquired he of the sales- man. "Warranted, twenty-two   carats fine, and going for the absurd sum of thirty dollars- not half the price of the cases." "Thirty-five," bids Wrexem. "Thirty-five is bid--thirty-five. Can I have any more?" appealing to green specs, but green specs had run the length of his tether, and after a few flourishes of the hammer the watch is knocked down to Mr. Wrexem. "This lot closes the sale for to-day, gentl'- men," said the  auctioneer. "Please walk in the rear room, and settle your bills." Mr. Wrexem counted out thirty-five dollars to a man at the desk.

Mr. Livingston, the gentleman in green spectacles, bid fifty, and you bid fifty-five." They were about calling in Mr. Livingston to corroborate their assertions when Wrexem yielded the point. "Perhaps I am   mistaken," thought he; "however, even fifty-five dollars is cheap for such an article." He gave the fifty-five dollars. Showing his purchase to a friend, that after-, noon, he was informed that it was galvanized brass, and not worth as many cents as he had given dollars. On returning to the shop the next day, and demanding the restitution of his money, they denied all knowledge of him or the watch. 13*  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7896-00000150"/> 298   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. On his menacing them with the terrors of the law, they laughed scornful laughs, and behaved rudely. He of the roseate whiskers glowered truculently at him from behind his vernal gog- gles; the auctioneer threatened to brain him with the hammer; and the clerical individual in the white cravat assailed him with abusive epithets, and, at last, squaring off scientifically, dealt him a plumper on the pineal gland of Descartes that well nigh knocked the soul from his body. Poor Mr. Wrexem was confined to his bed for several days by this rough usage, and, con- sequently, unable to appear at the wedding, but he sent Amy, as a wedding gift, some fine specimens of the fossil ferns of the oolitic period, which he had discovered while they were digging a new well near his residence.   CHAPTER X XV. DEATH AND DICING. JEFFERS was lying dangerously ill. On a Saturday night, at a late hour, a hack- ney coach drove up to the house in Park place, from which a woman descended. Ringing at the door, the colored porter readily admitted her. She walked hastily along the entry passage, up the stairs,: and into a back room, where the sick man lay. He was sleeping. "How is he now, Molly?" whispered the woman to the nurse. "( Ow--he's much bitter, mam, I think," an- swered the Gampish individual. The vAsitor, throwing off a scrap bonnet, overladen with feathers and flowers, went be- fore a mirror to smooth a thick mass of ringlets.  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7896-00000151"/> 300   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. She was a tall woman, clad in a tawdry, mere- tricious way. Her face, once handsome, was now thickly rouged and powdered. After dis- posing her toilet, she went to look at the slumbering man. How disease had altered him; his unshorn face was cadaverous; those once ebon locks and whiskers now grizzled, and tawny where the dye had burnt them; his eyes pitted, and his neck shrunken and lean. A knock at the door. It was the doctor. The woman quickly with- drew to the end of the room, and took a book," to hide her face. The physician gave her a glance, and turning to his patient, felt his pulse. "You gave him those powders as I directed, did you?" said he, interrogating the nurse. "Ow, yis sur-I did, sur." Jeffers awoke from his fevered sleep. "How do you feel now?" inquired the phy- sician. "I--I--doctor--" but a fit of coughing in- terrupted him. At last, recovering breath: , I feel better, I think, doctor." But his voice sounded hollow'as clod on coffin.   DEATH AND DICING.     301 "You must not deceive yourself, Mr. Jeffers. I feel it my duty to inform you that you are in a most critical state." "I'm better now, doctor, I know; I feel de- cidedly improved." ', I hope so, sincerely," resumed the doctor. "But, Mr. Jeffers, you must be prepared for everything. Even in the fullness of health we know not how soon we may be stricken down. We hold life but by a thread.  How  much more necessary is it, then, in sickness to be ready to look death calmly in the face. Let me advise you, Jeffers, as a friend-as a brother, to see some clergyman." "Nonsense, doctor!" said Jeffers, peevishy. "My friend, I will use no deception. I must candidly and truly tell you your position. I do not think you can live forty-eight hours longer." "What will you bet on that?"* said Jeffers, feebly. The doctor, with a pitying smile, turned from him. * Several similar instances of the ruling passion strong in death have occurred within our recollection. -   &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7896-00000152"/> 302   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. "Nurse, don't forget, in an hour, the other powder. I'll call again in the morning." As he left the room, the woman arose from her seat and went to the bedside. "Nell, is that you?" inquired Jeffers, in a weak voice. "Yes, Dick; I say, how do you- feel now?" "I've got the horrors; that d--  doctor wanted to scare the life out of me. Here--go in that cupboard, there; you'll find a decanter of brandy; bring it here." "No-no," interposed the nurse.  "You mussent have that; it 'ull kill you, shure." The woman pushed her rudely aside. ("Mind your business. Where's the tumblers?" She poured some of the liquor in a glass, drank it, and then filled it for Jeffers. He tossed it off quickly. "That's the medicine, after all! It does me more good than all your mixtures and powders. Give me some more." She obeyed, and also took a dram herself. "By heavens!" exclaimed Jeffers, "I feel as light as a feather and as strong as a horse." An- other fit of coughing strangled him. The par-   DEATH AND DICING.     303 oxysm was fearful. A moment after, he sank back- a current of arterial blood flowed over the white coverlet; he was dead! "Hees ded!" whispered the nurse. ( Dead!" repeated the woman, with a wild glare. "My God! I must leave this place. I can't stay here." In the room below the gamblers were busily engaged. The circle of inflamed players were eagerly watching the game. A waiter glided noiselessly towards the dealer, and whispered in his ear; his hand stopped as if paralyzed! "Gentlemen, we must stop the game; Jef- fers is dead." A shiver of terror ran through the group. They gathered their checks from the table in silence. One, an old man, whose emotions were ossified by the one passion-a stony-eyed wretch-remonstrated. "It isn't fair; I pro- test; let us finish the deal, anyhow; I am sure to win." He was overruled, and the throng-of gamesters left the house and turned homewards, as the chilly dawn of the Sabbath morn was creeping over the city streets.  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7896-00000153"/> 304r  THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. Far out in the country that morning, as the birds sang, the bees hummed, and nature re- joiced in the gladness of the peaceful, sunny Sabbath, an old lady wendeda' her slow way to the village church. How little did she reck, that her one child, her graceless son, was lying at that moment a stark corpse!-slain in his sin by the Almighty Hand!   CHAPTER XXVI. ,SUMMARY. THE excitement created by the failure of Hy- son &amp; Co., soon subsided. Hyson, however, was overwhelmed by the disaster, and came near being carried off by an apoplectic fit-so it was reported--at any rate, when he rolled down in his coach to the meeting of the credit- ors, he was exceedingly pale, and his neck- cloth was awry. He was the object of much commiseration; and the principal creditors, in the height of their condolence, were ready to accept any terms, particularly as they had as- certained that all the real estate belonged to Mrs. Hyson, and that the schedule of liabilities show- ed a large proportion of " confidential debts." One poor rogue, who demurred on the plea of being ruined by the compromise, was speedily  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7896-00000154"/> 306   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. silenced by Hyson's threatening, if they could not agree on his proposal of ten cents on the dollar, to throw the whole matter in the hands of atfignees. This settled the matter. The creditors having a wholesome dread of set- tlements by assignment. The Page estate was 7mot on the list of pre- ferred debts; and the Pages were fain to con- tent themselves with the modicum allowed them. Hyson &amp; Co. made a snug thing of it, and they now stand in better credit than ever. Mr. Hyson received an additional pang to the sum of his afflictions from the conduct of his steward Kelly. That ungrateful serpent, at the first news of the failure, decamped with two months' rent of the "Barrack ;" and Mr. Hyson, on investigation, discovered that he had been in the habit of selling the tracts, books, clothes, etc., left with him by benevolent persons for distribution, to junk-dealers and others. Rackett was arrested one evening, for being drunk and disorderly, and taken to the city prison. In the night, during an attack of de- lirium tremens, he dashed his skull against the   SUMMARY.   -307 cell wall and killed himself. They buried him in Potter's field. And Fanny, that rose of yesterday, we meet her often in Broadway, clattering her heeled gaiters. She dresses in elegant mourn- ing, and calls herself Mrs. Rackett (!).

CHAPTER XXVII. MR. WE.

But, alas! those intellectual pearls, sown broadcast to, perhaps, unappreci- ",  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7896-00000158"/> 314   THE SPUYTEN DUYVEL CHRONICLE. ative minds, are lost forever, and lie hidden in the bed of Lethe's dark, Sluggish stream. Mr. We was a man of genius-of talent- of wit; accomplished, learned, graceful, hand- some, fascinating; a poet, philosopher, critic- a Bacon, a D'Orsay, a Byron, a Crichton-he was all these and more-in his own estimation. Other people, we are afraid, took him at a dis- count and rated him a young man of great van- ity and small parts. Mr. We was, like many other great men, a widow's son. The good old affectionate soul toiled hard to procure an education for her boy, and happily died in the full conviction that her darling would eventually become President. He entered Chancellor X    '-- s office to study law, but unfortunately, a dangerous bee buzzed in his bonnet; the bee that sucks the flowers of Mount Hymettus, and she hummed, iambus-trochee-anapaest and dactyl contin- ually, and drove Blackstone and Chitty out, and Pope and Byron id. Great was the havoc in foolscap, and mule frenzy did his eyes roll in, until one day Chancellor X-- who was very precise and a little profane, said -to   MR. WE.       315 him: "Mr. We, there are two ways of going to the devil, one is by rhyming and the other is by drinking, and one is about as effectual as the other." And the Chancellor locJed up the foolscap and drafting paper. But he whistled against the wind, and though the writing pa- per was under lock, there were still law-blanks to be scrivened on, and many a dull mortgage or subpoena bore on its white back his turgid trochaics or harmonious heptameters. Mr. We attained the summit of earthly bliss, when his "( Stanzas" (written on a satisfaction-piece) ob- tained an insertion in the "Weekly Gleaner." This was the last straw that broke his legal back, and the Chancellor having discovered that Mr. We destroyed about twice as many blanks as his services were worth, bid him transfer his talents to a more congenial sphere of action. Mr. We waited on Mr. Z---, the proprietor of the "Gleaner," with a MSS. volume of poems. "They're very fine, no doubt," said that gentleman, 6" but there's no demand at present for poetry. We publish a little now and then      -  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7896-00000159"/> 316   THE SPUYTENDUYVEL CHRONICLE. when short of copy, or to fill up a column, but it's not read. The market needs short, inter- esting, exciting tales." Mr. We was, therefore, compelled to quench the afflatus, and bend his quill to prose. He achieved quite a success with his legends of Venice. He served up that devoted city ini every style. He dished up salmis of bravos and Rialtos -lion-mouths and gondolas - Bridges of Sighs and Councils of Ten-inquis- itors and Adriatics--doges and St. Marks. He stewed, and broiled, and roasted that poor un- fortunate Bianca, and that scowling villain, Jacopo-then they were peppered and salted, a black gondola or a plash in the Grand Canal thrown in-then again seasoned with a glass stiletto or a poisoning ring, and topped off with the mysterious Three or the dungeons be- neath the leads--thus for- three years did he batten like a ghoul on the remains of that "doomed daughter of the sea." He was then offered the post of sub-editor on that journal, and took charge of the arts and literature department. He cut up- the new books, wrote the theatrical criticisms, and   MR. WE.       317 slashed away at the pictures of the Academy of Design. Now had Mr. We reached the apogee of his greatness, now could that little body hardly contain its swelling pride. He doubted -not that the world's eyes were upon him ; that the great Thomas Babington Macau- lay conned his criticism with fear and trepida- tion; that Mr. Hawthorne lived in constant dread of his trenchant pen; that- Mr. Forrest sought his friendship from selfish motives; and that Durand and Kensett shook in their boots at -an unfavorable mention of their productions in his articles. In fact, he believed that a word or two from him could make or mar a reputation. By his patronage of Delia Daha, he ob- tained an introduction to the Page family, and like a host of others he fell in love with RMiss Amy. For a long time he was a constant vis- itor there, looming very large and very grand. How polite and deferential was he to Mrs. Page; how patronizing to Aunt Euphemia; how clever, brilliant, and witty to Amy; how friendly to Edgar; how ironic to Mix, and how sneering and lofty to Ben. But what a fall  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7896-00000160"/> 318   THE SPUYTENDUYYEL CHRONICLE. was there, my countrymen! when this Admira- ble Crichton, in the fullness of his inflation, proposed to Miss Amy Page, and was rejected. Picture to yourself the sad dismay of this suitor, self-satisfied that he needed but to cast the handkerchief 'to be accepted. But the check was salutary. Mr.-We commenced to criticize himself, and the scales gradually fell from his eyes. Now, we can venture to say, he is acquiring some wisdom, as he begins to discover how little of it he has got.   &#xD;</p>
