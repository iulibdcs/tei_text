            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN I was first invited to prepare an introduction to the story of "Carmine," I had
               not seen the manuscript, nor was I at all familiar with the character of the story;
               and it even seemed to me somewhat strange that an introduction should be needed. In
               the hasty thought with which I gave my promise, it seemed as if I was to introduce
               into society an unborn babe—without name, without character, without any known
               attributes; but as the proof-sheets were placed on my table, I saw the eminent
               fitness of preparing some special word of introduction to that which is to be a
               venture in an almost untrodden field of literature.</p>
            <p>The intent of the author has not been so much to tell a pleasing story; to relate
               Carmine's hatred—to tell how Miss Carmine was loved and wronged, as to place upon the
               pages of history a series of pictures showing the life of the Texas frontier; a life
               that is now passing away in the cloudy smoke of approaching engines. That life will
               never return, for, while grass grows and the waters run, the conditions of its
               existence can never be reproduced. The Indian, whose breath is as the morning vapor,
               soon will be known only in picture and in history. His history is secure; the white
               man's history is secure: civilization is on record, and barbarism has its printed
               annals. But between these two—on the confines of which both pass and repass—is, or
               rather was, a state of society that has had no printed history. It is a peculiar
               state of society; the traders and those who gathered around the camps of the frontier
               were no ordinary class of men:<pb n="iv" xml:id="VAC5694-00000004"/> they were either
               good or bad; either strong for the right or powerful for the evil. Educated, refined
               and intelligent; or, ignorant, uncouth and besotted. Pictures of such life must be
               strong in their lights. There is no gentle diffusion; no soft, sweet dimness: all is
               bold, strong, rugged. It is for this reason that stories like that of Carmine are so
               fascinating. They are pictures in strong light; they are intense; they ravish the
               mind, and delight it with presentations of life under new forms and in new
               combinations. This is the time when these pictures must be prepared, or the knowledge
               necessary to their delineation will be forever lost. This knowledge can only be in
               the hands of a few. In their nature none can now know them, save those who have
               participated in their life, endured its privations, and enjoyed its contrasts. The
               time will be when these simple pictures will have that relation to the world of
               literature which the annals of the border wars of Scotland now have to ours. Then it
               is wise to preserve them, and for that reason, if for no other, we are sure that
               every reader of "Carmine" will join in the request that the author will follow with
               other delineations of life on the Texas frontier.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IT was in the pleasant month of November, some twenty years ago when
                  the events to be recorded in this narrative transpired.</p>
               <p>It was scarcely passed the noonday-hour at Fort Belknap, on the Brazos river, when
                  the sentinel on guard observed, hastening over the wide expanse of timberless
                  sand, the forms of two horsemen riding rapidly towards the Fort. The corporal of
                  the guard was soon called, the two advancing forms speedily pointed out to him,
                  and then he was joined by several officers in undress uniforms, one of whom
                  appeared to be of superior rank, for he carried, in addition to his gold-headed
                  cane, a spy-glass. It was Colonel M—, the officer in command. The Colonel gazed
                  for an instant at the moving objects, as if to determine their character or fix
                  their identity, but failing in this, amid profound silence he placed the glass to
                  his eye; he looked earnestly for nearly a minute, then suddenly turning to Captain
                  Collins, who stood near his left shoulder, he whispered:</p>
               <p>"Order your men for immediate service; it is Deerheel and the Indian Wacco, two of
                  our trustiest scouts; the speed they travel means urgent haste and swift help. I
                  doubt not the train is near at hand, and Hosamarea threatening the
                  stragglers."</p>
               <p>"At the last conference," replied Captain Collins, "I urged<pb n="6-7"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000005"/> you to have the dirty villain shot; the rascal is
                  doomed to give us everlasting trouble."</p>
               <p>"We'll discuss his merit at some future time, Captain; but lose no time, order
                  your men to mount—both man and beast require exercise—quick! now see that you
                  relieve the train with all possible dispatch."</p>
               <p>The bugle soon sounded the call to arms, when, as if by some magic charm, men
                  darted from the dark rooms of the lower floors of the three-story stone buildings,
                  horses were led from the stables with orderly haste, and then was seen a stirring
                  scene of troops mounting their steeds with ready haste, while their features
                  assumed the stern cast of war's dread visage, and the battle horse champed his bit
                  and pawed the solid earth, as though eager for the fray. Scarcely had the company
                  formed into line ere the clattering tramp of the advancing horses was heard
                  approaching the sentinel, where the Colonel and Captain Collins, with impatient
                  haste, were awaiting their arrival.</p>
               <p>"Welcome! honest Deerheel, and you, Wacco!" said the Colonel to both the riders as
                  they alighted from their saddles. "Your horses look pretty well blowed; hard work
                  and worse news, I suppose. You see I have anticipated the latter: there—behold
                  that array of strength, and say if succor is not near at hand for the train, if
                  required;" and then, with a satisfied smile, he glanced at his fine company of
                  troopers.</p>
               <p>"I think, Colonel, your judgment has served you well this time. We scouted well
                  the foot hills as you advised, and then took a circuit round to the river bank,
                  near Rocky Point, and there struck a full trail; this we followed for two days,
                  when the scent became too hot for us; then we struck across the old Bear path and
                  lay close for observation. I knew you were expecting the train, and I firmly
                  believed the devils had got wind of it; and was more particularly satisfied of
                  this fact by finding this knife, which I know belongs to Powderhorn Joe, the
                  fellow, you know, who left the Fort, some ten days ago, on pretense of bargaining
                  for a white boy, whom, he said, was taken captive by the Apaches near Apache
                  Pass."</p>
               <p>"I marked him well, Deerheel," replied the Colonel, "and when I permitted him to
                  have the use of the arms and horse I thought I was doing wrong, but he plead so
                  earnestly for the rescue of the boy that I could not in my soul refuse him."</p>
               <p>"You acted like a man—like a soldier," replied Deerheel, "but I see it all now,
                  Colonel. He is a spy for Hosamarea, and he has informed this Comanche chief of
                  expectations in regard to the arrival of this train, and unless they are well
                  prepared, and constantly on the watch, they will have a hard time of it."</p>
               <p>"It is too bad," replied the Colonel, "will there never be any safety for man and
                  beast on this river? Murder after murder, theft after theft, and scarcely any
                  redress. The force at my command is scarcely able to hold the Fort, and aggressive
                  warfare is not my policy. But come to my room—not a word to any one," and then the
                  three confidants started for the Colonel's rooms, where they found Captain Collins
                  waiting orders to depart. Deerheel, whom Colonel M— seemed so particularly anxious
                  to see, and to whom he extended so cordial a welcome, was a man of some
                  twenty-five years of age, of fair complexion, gray eyes of great brightness, not
                  over tall, but possessing well-proportioned limbs and evenly-developed muscles,
                  and there was a litheness in his step that denoted great activity of limb and
                  nerve of muscle. Nor was the name of Deerheel, given him by the friendly Indians
                  lounging around the Fort, misapplied, for on one occasion, when a wounded deer
                  passed near the sentinel on duty, it was set after by many of the garrison and
                  Indians, but Deerheel soon distanced them in the chase, being the first to bury
                  his hunting knife in his chest. Wacco was an Apache Indian, small of stature, but
                  active, brave, and vigilant, and devoted to the white scout, to whom he was
                  indebted for his life in a battle with the Comanches. The white scout's steps he
                  had followed through many a tangled forest, now tracking the bear to his cover,
                  and then again watching the motions and the war-path of the subtle and daring
                  Comanche hunter and horse thief. At night, while the white scout was sleeping in
                  some dense chaparral, he has watched his slumber with all the faithful anxiety
                  that a mother could bestow on her sleeping child. Wacco seemed to have no other
                  motive in living than to return, by a most affectionate devotion to his friend,
                  the great favor which Deerheel had done him in the fight with the Comanches; and
                  the white scout was<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5694-00000006"/> not insensible as to
                  the value of Wacco as a friend and ally; and one, too, on whom he could, with a
                  certainty, count in the hour of extreme hazard.</p>
               <p>Scarcely an half hour had elapsed since the arrival of the scouts, before the
                  company of troopers, led by Captain Collins, had passed the sentry of the Fort. A
                  line of horsemen swung down the road with a heavy trotting gait, when the word of
                  command to "double-quick" was given. The horses were urged to a gallop, and then a
                  thick cloud of dust obscured them from further view.</p>
               <p>It was the day following the one on which Captain Collins took his departure with
                  his company, in search of the advancing trail, when a soldier led a gray horse
                  from the stable; and after carefully examining the animal's feet, and then
                  straightening the hair of his mane and tail, brought it before the trader's
                  door.</p>
               <p>"One moment, 'Mike,'" spoke a tall form which issued from the house, "I must see
                  the Colonel before I go. Ah, here he comes. I will meet him." At that moment the
                  Colonel advanced and extended his hand, saying: "Ah, Carmine, you are going to
                  ride; a fine, stout horse you have there, I doubt if it has its equal in the
                  garrison."</p>
               <p>"He's well enough," replied the trader. "I've owned better and I've had worse.
                  He's a little too fractious for my use, and if you like him I will send him to
                  your quarters to-morrow." "I accept the gift," replied the Colonel, giving the
                  trader a hearty grasp of the hand while he spoke. "Colonel," replied Carmine, "I
                  have a favor to ask of you, and I wish you to allay a great anxiety of mind which
                  has possessed me since yesterday. I am constantly annoyed by a presentiment of
                  evil. Pray, tell me truly, what news brought the scouts? No one seems to know
                  anything about the hurrying away of the troops, and the silence observed about the
                  whole affair."</p>
               <p>"I may tell you now," replied the Colonel, in a serious tone of voice. "The train
                  is nearing the Fort, and likely to be attacked by the Camanches; but I think I
                  have defeated their little game, as Collins is not a slow rider, and his men not
                  the boys to give way when they scent the breeze of battle."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how I thank you for your prompt action in this hour of peril. Know
                  "Colonel—;" here the trader's voice failed him, when, in a scarcely audible tone,
                  he added: "my wife—my only child, my darling Lucy—are coming with that train."</p>
               <p>"And I warrant you they are safe," rejoined the Colonel in a consoling voice. "I
                  tell you I would stake my life upon the issue. Collins will be there with his
                  troopers, and braver and truer hearts never followed such a leader to battle. I've
                  seen them hard pressed, but they never flinched yet, and though really
                  outnumbered, they never turned their backs upon these terrible pests of
                  civilization. I am hourly expecting them, and I have no doubt you will meet them
                  escorting your wife to the Fort."</p>
               <p>"Yes; I know Captain Collins well; he is a brave and honorable officer, Colonel. I
                  am glad he is in command; but I cannot account for it—I have a strange
                  presentiment of evil. I wonder, too, why the Indians should desire to attack the
                  train, because they have been informed by several of the men in my employ that
                  most of the goods and supplies were to be distributed among them," replied
                  Carmine. "Besides," he added, "there is but one solution of the mystery of their
                  plundering the train, and that is the taking of some prisoners and claiming a
                  reward for their return."</p>
               <p>"Did any one know of your wife and daughter being with the train?" asked the
                  Colonel.</p>
               <p>"No one but Powderhorn Joe, and I have too much confidence in him to think for a
                  moment that he would betray me; though I confess, of late several persons have
                  warned me against him, as I understand he has lost heavily at play."</p>
               <p>"Heavens! is it possible?" replied the agitated Colonel. "He knew this? I thought
                  his actions very strange of late. I have been sadly imposed upon. We have both
                  been betrayed in our confidence in the villain. I foolishly allowed him to go on
                  an errand of mercy, to redeem a captive boy. Ah, I see it all; 'tis a vile plot.
                  For true, there is danger. Your wife and daughter are in peril. He will try to
                  capture them, and, knowing you to be rich, he will extort a heavy ransom; but let
                  us cheer up. I think the boys will arrive in good time to foil the murdering
                  scamps."</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5694-00000007"/>
               <p>Carmine's frame trembled with visible emotion. He grasped the Colonel's hand in
                  silence, pulled the rim of his hat closely down over his, eyes, and then, mounting
                  his gallant gray, was soon lost to the gaze of the sympathizing Colonel.</p>
               <p>The trader rode with rapid pace along the road leading from the Fort towards the
                  northeast. At intervals of distance, patches of mesquite shrubbery checkered the
                  valley or river bottom, and not unfrequently the broad leaf of the cactus plant
                  was interspersed through the dense thickets of chaparral. Having, with a hurried
                  gallop, traversed the sandy portion of land lying between the timber and Fort, he
                  tightened up the bridle-reins, and, with soothing words, reduced his restive horse
                  to a very slow walk.</p>
               <p>He sat firm in his saddle, and, save the merest curve in his shoulders, and an
                  impatient movement in his body, would have been considered a graceful and more
                  youthful rider. His form was well proportioned, his beard was red and of more than
                  ordinary length, and his hair, which was of a light auburn hue from exposure to
                  the sun, waved in luxuriant curls as he was borne along by his quick-motioned
                  steed, in solitary reverie, toward the advancing train.</p>
               <p>"Weekly have I ridden this road; hourly have I looked for the happy meeting with
                  those most dear to me in life and now all ends in a desperate chance whether we
                  shall ever meet—and that the dust of the plains may not prove their resting place
                  and the Indians their executioners. Alas! alas! far this evil day! woe! woe! to
                  the life of man!"</p>
               <p>Thus soliloquized the trader, as he brought his horse to a halt, and then listened
                  attentively, for his ear seemed to catch the report of distant firing. "No, no,"
                  he added, "my anxious fears mislead me; silence! all is silence! Man nor beast is
                  visible in this desolate abode."</p>
               <p>He had now reached a distance of four miles from the Fort, when, urging his horse
                  into a brisk trot over that part of the road, on both sides of which the
                  cotton-wood trees and chaparral shut out a very extensive view of the surrounding
                  country, he found himself in the middle of a dry creek, which, in the spring
                  season of the year, was filled with the waters of the snow in the mountains.
                  Ascending the slight incline upon the opposite bank he beheld before him three
                  Indians, with reversed lances, rapidly approaching, and upon further scrutiny, he
                  discovered seven more warriors of the Comanche nation, also following in the same
                  direction. Carmine possessed great decision of character. With him, to think was
                  to act. He was thoroughly conversant with the nature and habits of the surrounding
                  tribes of Indians; so, reining in his fractious animal, which appeared anxious for
                  retreat, and very restive under restraint, he awaited, anxiously, their
                  approach.</p>
               <p>They came up to him in a friendly manner and demanded tobacco. Carmine assured
                  them by signs and gestures that he was unarmed, and then drawing a small
                  pocket-knife, he cut up what tobacco he had into eleven pieces, placed these upon
                  the palm of his extended hand, motioned to them to each separately take a piece,
                  also that one was to be reserved for himself. This they did, good-humoredly,
                  whereat, they seemed amused by the novelty of the proceeding; and, after saluting
                  him with their spears, departed as rapidly and suddenly as they had appeared. Not
                  liking the prospects ahead, the trader again turned toward the Fort, but his pace
                  was slow, for he seemed loth to give up the object of his ride. After riding back
                  for a mile, he dismounted and seated himself upon a fallen tree near the road, and
                  then indulged his imagination in many wild conjectures in regard to the future
                  events of the day's proceedings. An hour or more he sat in deep musings, when his
                  horse suddenly pricked up his ears, then wheeling round, gazed earnestly up the
                  road over which he had but recently retraced his steps. "More of these cursed red
                  devils, I suppose," said the trader, as he prepared to mount his horse, but
                  scarcely was he seated in the saddle when a trooper, riding at a furious rate of
                  speed, passed him with racer-flight, and, without deigning to notice him, urged
                  his course directly toward the Fort. Carmine could distinctly see a large spear
                  wound upon the flanks of the trooper's horse, as he passed, and then feeling a
                  sickening sensation creep over his form, he dismounted to await results. "As my
                  worst fears portended," he whispered, "they have met the Comanches, or else the
                  fellow is bearer of news and was waylaid by the eleven and they sent a lance into
                  his beast."</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5694-00000008"/>
               <p>Leaving Carmine in his distressing mental condition, we will follow the gallant
                  Captain Collins on his march to relieve the train: They bivouacked some eight
                  miles from the Fort—this was the night of the day on which they took their
                  departure. A halt was then made and scouts sent out in different directions to
                  look for Indians. The night passed quietly away, and a glorious sunrise ushered in
                  the day, when, after an early breakfast, the scouts returned, reporting the train
                  to be in sight and Indian signs most numerous. Captain Collins, more brave than
                  cautious, determined on striking the main trail and following it, and, in case of
                  failure to come up with the Camanche, to make a circuit round the foot of the
                  hills and join the train about noon. This was a fatal error, as we shall presently
                  see. To Deerheel or Wacco, the presence of the eleven, or even their trail, would
                  have instantly convinced them that mischief was brewing, and that the small band
                  was merely used as a decoy to entangle the trail, and to lead astray the Captain
                  and his cavalry—and so it seemed in the end, for the Captain failed to come up
                  with the main body of the enemy, though he had ridden some ten miles in pursuit.
                  It is well known that the Indians usually attack their enemies early in the
                  morning or late in the evening, and Captain Collins felt no fear on the score of
                  safety for the train, but as his men were in want of nourishment, he left off
                  following the trail and directed his march to meet the advancing teamsters. He had
                  proceeded but a mile or so when he came within sight of the wagons and distinctly
                  heard the reports of firearms. He then fancied he saw the smoke ascending from
                  behind the wagons. "Forward!" rung out his clear, manly voice; "double-quick, men!
                  The train is attacked; let us not be too late to the rescue!" and spur, and lash,
                  and shout, urged the horses to their utmost speed. It was too true, for at this
                  very moment the emigrants and the few soldiers with the train were fighting for
                  their lives and property. Hosamarea, the greatest schemer and most cunning chief
                  of the Camanche nation, had planned the onset, and Powderhorn Joe, a naturalized
                  chief, had led the attack. The train was composed of some twenty wagons and had an
                  escort of some eight or ten soldiers, but being so nearly arrived at the Fort, and
                  fearing no attack by daylight, they had thrown off all discipline, and the
                  teamsters themselves had ceased to be vigilant, and even the wagon-master and
                  agent of the transportation stores had fallen back behind the train, in hopes of
                  getting a shot at some straggling buffalo bulls, which sullenly retired as they
                  approached. The thick undergrowth of mesquite-chaparral concealed the Indians from
                  view, and at the very moment the teamsters thought their lives and cattle were
                  most secure, Powderhorn Joe and his band, with lance and tomahawk, were upon them.
                  The cattle, terrified by the scent, aspect, and murderous whoops and horrid shouts
                  of the savages, swerved from the roads, either breaking the tongues of the wagons,
                  or completely overturning them. The men though taken by surprise, drew their
                  revolvers from their holsters, and seeking shelter behind the wagons and among the
                  oxen, made a desperate resistance, and succeeded for a time in deterring the
                  Indians from a bodily rencounter. But if the savages hesitated, it was only for a
                  few moments, for, having drawn the fire of the wagoners, and cut off the
                  wagon-master—and also the soldiers, who sought safety in flight—with the most
                  fearful and fiendish yells, quickly encircled the wagons, and again, like furies,
                  rushed upon their defenseless victims, and the butchery began in real earnest and
                  with the most sanguinary results. Like one maddened into rage by some evil spirit,
                  was seen Powderhorn Joe, followed by several chiefs, running from wagon to wagon,
                  first glancing into one and then bounding away, as though in search of some one
                  whom he expected to meet with in the train.</p>
               <p>He was dressed at every point like an Indian, and wore the feathers of a chief in
                  his disguised hair. With a drawn bowie-knife in his right and a revolver in his
                  left hand, he hastened on in his search until reaching the center wagon, which was
                  distinguished from the others by its painted sides and double canvas covering, he
                  halted, and next bounding upon the tongue, he hurled from the front entrance some
                  boxes which had been piled up for protection, and then were heard the appalling,
                  screams of women in distress, mingled with cries for mercy and for help; but
                  unavailing were their pleadings and entreaties, and their agonizing tears of
                  distress. But time was too precious for Powderhorn<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000009"/> horn Joe to listen, even for a moment, to the
                  prayers of the suppliant. He was a merciless foe, and soon was seen to issue from
                  the rear of the wagon-box carrying in his arms the form of a young girl, with hair
                  disheveled and hanging in a mass of wild confusion over the shoulder of the
                  monster, as he bore her to his horse, which was tied in the bushes near the point
                  of attack. At this moment, the faint echo of the bugle's blast lingered for an
                  instant above the noise and confusion of the strife. This challenge was answered
                  by a renewed shout of defiance from the savages, who, dodging behind the wheels of
                  the wagons and squatting in the bushes, prepared to dispute the spoils which they
                  had justly won by the harsh rules of war. Like a herd of wild horses, flying
                  before the flames of a prairie fire, with Captain Collins leading, the troops were
                  upon them. There was hot work, close quarters, and quick and desperate fighting
                  then and there. Here flashed the gleam of the sabre; there fell a trooper from his
                  steed—firing at the foe while lying wounded upon the ground; here came the quick
                  report of the revolver; there flashed the pointed lance. On sped the fight, from
                  wagon to wagon; from bush to bush—the wild and confused alarm of battle swelled
                  until the air was filled with sulphury smoke, and the curses of the wounded
                  Comanches were heard above the noise of battle. One hour of close, hard and
                  desperate fighting, and the savages no longer disputed for the plunder, but beat a
                  precipitate retreat for the adjacent timber, pursued by as many of the cavalry as
                  were able to sit upon their horses. A courier was dispatched to the Fort, and this
                  was the trooper whom Carmine observed to pass him on the road in such a wild fury
                  of speed. Captain Collins had been seriously wounded, as also had some dozen of
                  his men, two having been killed by the ambushed foe. Many of the teamsters had
                  been wounded, and were lying scattered around in the bushes or under the
                  wagon-beds, and many had been killed, while fighting till the last gasp. Several
                  hours elapsed before assistance was brought, when a guard was placed over the
                  wagons, and the wounded removed in ambulances to the Fort. Mrs. Carmine was handed
                  from the wagon in an insensible condition, and carefully placed in one of the
                  ambulances, and when restoratives were applied she frantically called for her
                  daughter—Lucy—with such heart-rending cries of misery as to cause the stoutest
                  heart to feel the pressure of a sadness of the spirit. She had received a severe
                  knife wound in her hand, and an ugly gash upon her shoulder, while defending her
                  daughter in her struggles with Powderhorn Joe; and so ended the fight and the
                  capture of Miss Lucy Carmine, a girl in her sixteenth year, refined in her
                  manners, fair in her beauty, dutiful in her conduct towards her parents, and as
                  innocent of evil as the fairest flower that decks our western plains. Need we
                  wonder, then, that the breast of the trader was filled with such anxious
                  solicitude for her safety? Need we suppose otherwise than that, when he heard of
                  the great misfortune which had befallen the train, he was smothered, stifled with
                  grief and sorrow, and that a dumbness, emanating from the influence of despair,
                  mastered his resolute will, and that he sank insensible for a time upon the cold,
                  yet his native earth?</p>
               <p>As the ambulance, containing the wounded wife drew near, Carmine seemed to collect
                  his scattered senses, and once more regained his feet. To a close observer, the
                  stooping bend in his shoulders seemed more round and his gait less firm than
                  before the capture of his only, and to him beloved, child. The manly heart of
                  Colonel M— prompted him to be present on the occasion, to offer that consoling
                  sympathy so much required, and so greatly appreciated by a wounded and distressed
                  spirit in the hour of oppressive grief. Arm in arm with the trader, he led the way
                  to the ambulance.</p>
               <p>"Carmine," said the wife, between the sobbings of her suppressed emotion, "I came
                  into this wild country at your bidding, but the loved one, who sanctified our
                  lives by her love and piety, is"—</p>
               <p>"A prisoner; merely a prisoner," broke in the discreet Colonel. "My whole force
                  will be used for her rescue. Be assured, no harm will come of it, save the
                  inconvenience attending captivity, which I will prove to you shall be of short
                  duration."</p>
               <p>"But the misery of this journey," broke in the agonized wife; "so near our
                  destination; so near, so near to you, Carmine; so near the Fort—where she was to
                  meet that father who so idolized a child so truly deserving. Have you nothing to
                  say? O,<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5694-00000010"/> my husband! has the shock proved
                  too severe for your nerves? Remember, we still live for each other; as we have
                  journeyed together through the past, let us be true to ourselves in the
                  future."</p>
               <p>"Amen!" added the Colonel. "Such a wife; such a woman; such a Christian lady,
                  Carmine, is both a treasure and a comfort."</p>
               <p>"I feel oppressed, Colonel; do order the ambulance to the Fort—yet, stay!" said
                  the trader in broken sentences, for as he glanced around the circle of dismounted
                  troopers, his eye rested upon the passive form of the white scout, Deerheel. The
                  young man's countenance was deathly pale, his arms were folded across his chest,
                  while his Indian companion stood, rifle in hand, gazing wonderingly into his face,
                  marveling much at the change which had so suddenly taken place in the white man's
                  skin.</p>
               <p>The trader's and the scout's eyes met in direct, or—it might be said in military
                  parlance—within point-blank range. The gaze of Deerheel was cold and fixed, while
                  that of the trader was moistened with tears.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>DEERHEEL," said the trader, "you may consider this blow to be a
                  just retribution for the wrong I seemingly did you in the East; but, sir, I am of
                  that opinion still, and, were my daughter now at liberty, and were she to plead
                  for your marriage on bended knees, I would not alter my first determination."</p>
               <p>"Husband! husband!" almost shouted the wife, "I see it is Richard Crampton to whom
                  you speak. Pray, restrain your temper. I have long since forgiven him, and I know
                  his image lives in the mind of our child."</p>
               <p>"If she lives!" muttered the trader. "But, Colonel, bid them go and leave me for a
                  moment with this young man;" and then no more was spoken until the troopers and
                  ambulances had passed on towards the Fort, after which the trader resumed his
                  speech:</p>
               <p>"I said, Crampton, that I would not alter my mind in regard to your wedding my
                  child. You know well the reason for my thus denying your union. But why, why
                  should I speculate about that which may not exist? O, my daughter! my child! my
                  lost Lucy!" Further restraining his tears and grief was impossible, and Carmine,
                  who had evinced such a resolute bearing in the presence of his wife, now broke
                  forth into wild lamentations of despair.</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5694-00000011"/>
               <p>When his paroxysm of grief had subsided, the young man approached and offered his
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"Carmine," said he in a faltering tone, "you wrong me now as you did in my earlier
                  days. I shall not upbraid you now. I asked your daughter's hand then in marriage,
                  and this you did refuse. To banish all thoughts of her; to be beyond the sight of
                  an object I so much desired to possess, and knew it folly to expect, I sought the
                  frontier to seek relief in the wild scenes of the war-path and the chase, trusting
                  that forgetfulness would follow on the heels of distance, while memory of the
                  unhappy past would subside into nothingness. I never crossed your path, when I
                  could avoid it at the Fort; I never sought nor asked recognition on your part; I
                  ask it not now. But I tell you, Carmine, that, by the living God! I will do my
                  duty in this crisis! Your daughter shall be restored to you, though this poor life
                  of mine yield up its existence. You shall no longer be harrassed by my presence,
                  for to-morrow will see Wacco and his friend on the trail of Powderhorn Joe; and
                  woe! woe! to the traitorous thief when we meet."</p>
               <p>Before the trader could reply, the scout and his friend had hurried from his
                  presence, leaving Carmine in a most confused state of mind, and with a soul as
                  equally troubled, the trader continued:</p>
               <p>"Richard Crampton! so much the man, save in one point; one fatal point: he wears
                  not the badge of honor upon his brow. And Lucy—my God, have mercy upon my spirit,
                  which now strives to correct and accuse, while this heavy misfortune has befallen
                  me!"</p>
               <p>On leaving the presence of the trader, the scout and his trusty friend, Wacco,
                  proceeded, with rapid steps, toward a bubbling spring of purest water, known as
                  the Comanche or Pearl spring. A large sycamore tree, with a few bastard oaks,
                  screened the water from the noonday sun, and it was to this sylvan abode that the
                  scout directed his steps, to meditate in silence upon the strange incidents of his
                  eventful life. The last hope—the hope of obtaining Lucy Carmine for a wife—had now
                  fled from him, as a meteor through the air, and now a dark gloom settled over his
                  thoughts, and he needed quiet to enable his mind to resume its accustomed
                  equanimity of temper and tone of thinking. Lucy Carmine and himself had been
                  intimate from youth, and when they grew up together, he was her acknowledged
                  lover—but suddenly there grew a coldness in her manner, and her father no longer
                  received him into his house with favor or pleasure. Believing himself injured,
                  without a proper investigation or hearing, and being of a proud and honorable
                  mind, he wrote Lucy a farewell letter, releasing her from all engagements which
                  she had contracted with him in his earlier days, and then, bidding civilization
                  adieu, sought the wilds of the West, and indulged in the sports of the chase or
                  the dangers of the war-path.</p>
               <p>Those were the days when the pioneer and the settler carried his ax in one hand
                  and his rifle in the other. The trials which the emigrants to this favored land
                  endured can scarcely be recounted, much less enlarged upon, even in a work of a
                  thousand pages. Carmine could acknowledge this truth, and Deerheel—not less
                  true—could testify to the verity of this statement, and it is to the noble-minded,
                  courageous and spirited hearts of her daughters, that Texas to-day owes so much of
                  her solid bravery and patriotic, impulsive ardor for liberty. Deerheel knew naught
                  of fear, but he combined, in a wonderful degree, great daring and remarkable
                  caution; and, when added to this, gentlemanly manners and unobtrusive bearing, he
                  failed not to become popular with the Colonel and the garrison.</p>
               <p>With these remarks upon the most marked characters in this narrative, we proceed
                  with the story, closely following, as nearly as possible, the facts of this
                  strange adventure:</p>
               <p>Deerheel sent a letter to the Fort—to the Colonel—that night, by Wacco, stating
                  his determination to follow on the trail of Powderhorn Joe, and if he could not
                  succeed in rescuing the girl, at all events ascertain the camp in which she was
                  held a captive; and also apologizing for his not coming in person, from motives of
                  delicacy, because of the position in which he was placed towards Carmine. The
                  stars shown dimly through the misty atmosphere of twilight when Wacco returned,
                  stating that the Colonel had ordered the best horses in the garrison to be placed
                  under his command, and also wishing him and Wacco<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000012"/> God-speed upon their journey. The Indian also
                  informed him that Mrs. Carmine was faithfully nursed by the wives of the officers,
                  and she had, undetected, as he supposed, given him a letter for Deerheel, when not
                  observed by the person present; and then the Indian drew a crumpled letter from
                  the pocket of his hunting-shirt, and handed it to the hunter with as much caution
                  as he had received it.</p>
               <p>"It is a letter of thanks from Lucy's mother—thanking me for my intended attempt
                  of rescuing her child, but she need not have done so. I require no such stimulant
                  to action. If I succeed, I shall not presume to press my suit; no, she must be at
                  liberty to decide without fear of the censure of ingratitude or the weight of
                  obligations. But come, Wacco, strike a match and light the bull's-eye lantern, and
                  let's read the contents."</p>
               <p>Thus soliloquizing, he broke the envelope, and, when the light made the writing
                  visible, he read as follows:</p>
               <p>"I am now nearing the point where we are likely to meet in person, for I have been
                  informed of your presence at the Fort. My earnest request to you is, that you pass
                  me as a stranger, and presume not on the events of the past. It is my parents'
                  request, you know, Richard. If I have been forbidden to love the dearest object of
                  my childhood, I could not pledge my faith to another. From the innermost recesses
                  of my heart, I wish you joy in this world and happiness in the next. Pray, forgive
                  me, for I cannot, dare not, write more—from a deep sense of duty I owe to the
                  authors of my worldly existence. LUCY.</p>
               <p>"To Mr. Richard Crampton."</p>
               <p>The agitation he manifested when he read this unexpected epistle, startled the
                  Indian to such a degree that the lantern dropped from his hand, but when it was
                  relighted he was equally astonished at not being able to detect the slightest
                  traces of the trembling in the frame of the hunter, and which had so unnerved him
                  when he let fall the light.</p>
               <p>The night wore on a-pace. The young moon, with modest crest, was sinking
                  gracefully, quietly, behind the rugged tips of the mountain's brow; the she-wolf
                  had led her young whelps from the cave, and the buffalo sought his bed on the open
                  plain; when the hunter prepared to follow the example of his Indian friend, and
                  seek repose upon his blanket and mother earth. The last glimmer of the watch-fire,
                  wherewith they had prepared their meal, sent but a glistening, ray upon the trunks
                  of the motionless trees, as a shadow, of the thinnest outlines of the human form,
                  flitted for an instant upon the surrounding bushes, when the tall form of the
                  trailer stood directly before the eyes of the hunter.</p>
               <p>"You are not a faithful watchman," quietly observed Carmine, "You would fall an
                  easy prey to an active and secret foe—but come here to request a favor, not to
                  find fault with your vigilance."</p>
               <p>"I saw you advancing; at least knew of it," replied Deerheel as he continued to
                  make his preparation for his night's repose. "I knew of it by the flutter the
                  little bird made, which you scared from the bush, and by the silence suddenly
                  manifested by that old wolf on the hill, as you passed near her on the path from
                  the Fort; and, further, sir I know your business and why I am indebted to you for
                  this intrusion."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" rejoined Carmine. "You are sagely wise—probably a seer—but as you have
                  spoken the truth, I feel bound to respect your honesty. I came here for a certain
                  purpose."</p>
               <p>"And that purpose," quietly replied Deerheel, "was to see the contents of a
                  certain letter."</p>
               <p>"You have guessed the object of ny visit; and now I demand its immediate
                  surrender."</p>
               <p>"Demand!" replied the hunter, as be straightened his muscular form to its full
                  length. "Solicit, you mean."</p>
               <p>"Demand is the strong word I use, Crampton. You have ever proved a source of
                  trouble to me; you have darkened my thoughts by day and my dreams by night; you
                  have ever been present to me in one shape or another, but always as a
                  thief—wishing, striving and cunningly devising plans to steal away my only child;
                  and, by the Heavens above me! I had rather hear of her butchery by the Indians
                  than that she were wedded to such a villain. Why not rid myself of such a curse to
                  my existence at once?" And then, tremblingly drawing a Derringer pistol from his
                  pocket, he hesitatingly cocked it. At this moment, the hunter made a sign, as if
                  to some one behind the<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5694-00000013"/> trailer, who
                  turned to behold the uplifted arm of the Indian, Wacco, with upraised knife, ready
                  to plunge it into his heart at any given signal from the hunter. "I see you have
                  your allies in iniquity," he said, as he let down the hammer of the pistol.</p>
               <p>"Carmine," said the hunter, "here, take the letter. I wonder that they have
                  permitted you to leave the Fort in your great mental grief. You are laboring under
                  some wild hallucination, I am neither your enemy nor the man-villain you take me
                  for. I am certainly your friend—so depart in peace."</p>
               <p>The trader grasped the offered letter, and, without another word, turned his back
                  upon the hunter, and departed as noiselessly as he had intruded.</p>
               <p>"Watch him, Wacco," said Deerheel; "he is demented; grief has deranged his
                  intellect."</p>
               <p>When Wacco had departed, he threw his body down to sleep, but it was deep into the
                  night before the gentle soother of nervous life deigned to visit his hunter's
                  couch.</p>
               <p>In strict justice to Lucy, probably he should not so readily have parted with her
                  letter; and then, again, the thought occurred to him—in self-justification—that to
                  relieve the distressed mind of her father, who had by some chance known of the
                  letter having been sent to him, it was his duty so to act. Besides, did any one
                  know of Lucy's existence? Was she alive? a living, breathing mortal, capable of
                  thinking of any object; remembering any one who had been dear to her in the
                  past?</p>
               <p>The supposition of Powderhorn Joe having captured his prize to obtain a heavy
                  reward, was plausible; but might not the robber be won over by the constant sight
                  of her beauty? was he less capable of loving than other mortals? might not there
                  exist within his evil breast other leading passions, besides that of avarice? If
                  so, Lucy was lost to them beyond the power of redemption! her fate was sealed! her
                  destiny determined! And Carmine, too? What could possibly be the cause of his
                  intense hatred toward himself—that the heart of a father should be so lost to all
                  love for his child as to rather see her slain by a savage foe than become his
                  bride? All these worrying conjectures drove quietude from his very soul. Yet he
                  resolved to do his duty, fulfill his promise, and then seek some other desolate
                  abode to conquer his passion.</p>
               <p>True to his promise, the following day witnessed the departure of the Indian and
                  the hunter in search of Lucy Carmine. Wacco had brought two stout Indian ponies
                  from the Fort, likewise ammunition, and a quantity of dried buffalo meat. They
                  were both armed with Mississippi rifles. Deerheel's weapon was of a most peculiar
                  make and finish: it was gain-twist barrel, having been specially bored and cut by
                  a celebrated gunsmith—at present residing in this State—James right, better known
                  as "Particular Jim." Its point-blank range was said to be four hundred yards.<ref
                     rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                   Their revolvers and rifles being loaded with care, and saddles securely
                  girthed, without further delay, they directed their course toward the scene of the
                  late disastrous robbery of the train, where they arrived before noon on the same
                  day. The ground bore witness to the desperate nature of the struggle. Numerous
                  holes were visible in the sand, made by wolves during the night, in search of dead
                  bodies. Wherever the blood had coagulated along the road, there the wolf had pawed
                  away the sand and gravel in search of dead bodies. The Indians had removed the
                  bodies of their slain, and those of the emigrants butchered in the fight, and the
                  troopers killed, had been carried to the Fort and buried with military honors.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                  <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>This celebrated rifle was used in the Confederate war, by Henry Rice, son of
                     S. M. Rice, and better known in the service as "Old Pap." The rifle
                     sustained its reputation for accuracy and distance.</p>
               </note>
               <p>When Indians attack a train, a certain number is selected for engaging the enemy
                  in battle; others to plunder the wagons and another party to run off the cattle
                  and horses. The greatest celerity is generally used on such an occasion by the
                  thieves, and the Indians succeeded in carrying off in this instance many horses
                  and oxen, together with clothing and a variety of house-hold articles belonging to
                  the emigrants.</p>
               <p>After a short rest amid the chaparral, the scouts struck off in a westerly course
                  which they kept until they reached a small tributary of the Brazos river, where
                  they encamped for the night. They had discovered but a very old Indian trail, and
                  save a bounding deer or startled antelope, had met with but few objects of
                  interest to excite their fears, nor any signs worthy of their notice. Intending to
                  strike the main fork of the river, they diverged to the southwest, and on the
                  following evening reached the stream, the red waters of which were slowly flowing
                     toward<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5694-00000014"/> the gulf, gurgling at narrow
                  places between its banks of red clay or granite boulders. The scouts were now
                  compelled to use great caution to protect themselves from the roving bands, both
                  of Apaches and Comanches. They selected for their encampment a dense thicket of
                  chaparral, bordering or fringing the edge of the tall trees of the river bottom,
                  and, having securely staked out their horses and eaten their dried meat supper,
                  they spread their blankets, and were soon oblivious to all dangers, or any fear of
                  detection. When day dawned, a thick mist hung over the valley, which obscured the
                  steep banks of the stream.</p>
               <p>"Now for a quick fire, and a hot cup of coffee, Wacco; the smoke of a brisk fire
                  will scarcely be visible," said Deerheel.</p>
               <p>The Indian conversed entirely in the Spanish language, for, though Wacco could
                  speak both the Apache and Comanche tongues, and had often been employed as
                  interpreter at the Fort, in communicating with these tribes, yet Deerheel knew
                  only the Spanish and English languages, and used the former in conversation with
                  his companion. They had brought with them a can of ground coffee, matches and
                  dried meat—the last being only a moderate supply; but they relied upon their
                  rifles, as well for food as to ward off danger from themselves. The large hunting
                  cup served to boil the coffee, and as they sat by the fire, watching the cup,
                  Wacco said:</p>
               <p>"The Comanche travels every path in this region. It was near this camp that Modoc,
                  their chief captain, was killed by the falling of his horse. You see that mountain
                  over there," he continued—"no, the fog hides; no matter. They were riding
                  single-file, down the rocks, when the horse grew weak in his fore legs, suddenly
                  let down, and Modoc fell over his head and broke his neck. Since that day, unless
                  hard pressed, no Comanche warrior has ridden over that mountain. They were on the
                  war-path, but instantly returned, and the nation went into mourning for three full
                  moons. The Great Spirit was angry and they sought to ask forgiveness."</p>
               <p>"Suppose we follow down the edge of the forest, as most likely to strike the
                  trail," said the scout.</p>
               <p>"No, no!" replied Wacco, "no good; stay sleep; no day; night good." And then he
                  explained that as came and went the moon, so do the Indians move; and the fuller
                  the moon the stronger grows their desire to rove, and that they should certainly
                  see them going and coming as the moon increased in brightness. "You forget,
                  Wacco," thoughtfully replied the scout, "that all the time we delay, Miss Carmine
                  is suffering captivity—a horrible condition in which to exist."</p>
               <p>"If she is to be saved in the end, she is safe now," quickly answered the Indian.
                  "Powderhorn Joe loves silver more than he loves any nice young girl," and the
                  deep-set, black eyes gleamed forth a dazzling luster. "Perhaps not so if he
                  carried less moss of age upon his head and feet," he added.</p>
               <p>"O," replied the scout, "but Hosamarea might wish her for a wife, and claim her;
                  then her condition would be miserable indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Hosamarea, nor any other chief can take her from him. Their laws of war are
                  fixed, never to be broken: Whatever one takes in battle belongs to that Indian; no
                  one can take it from the warrior; it would be death to the chief attempting it.
                  The horse taken, the goods taken, the prisoner taken, all belong to the Indian who
                  hides or carries them away. This rule they never violate. If it were otherwise
                  they would not fight; would not go to war. No, the chief cannot take anything but
                  what he earns himself in battle, unless he is sick, and then the people provide
                  for him and his squaws."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," replied the scout, "I hope it is so."</p>
               <p>"It is true," asserted the Indian, "I know their laws and their people."</p>
               <p>The hunter's breakfast of dried meat and hot coffee was soon dispatched, the
                  ponies staked out on new ground, the rifles examined with great scrutiny, and
                  their blankets, and such small articles of camp convenience, having been hid away
                  in the bush, the two scouts, after a brief consultation, cautiously started forth
                  upon a voyage of discovery. Both men knew they were trespassing upon a favorite
                  portion of the red man's hunting ground, but necessity urged them to venture where
                  discretion would have bidden them halt. They waded the stream at a buffalo ford
                  which had been, by frequent passage of the herds, cut into a deep path up the
                  opposite bank of red clay.<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5694-00000015"/> which was at
                  places perpendicularly high, and frequently rocky at the base. Once upon the bank,
                  the towering pine, the graceful elm, the stately cotton-wood tree, and the sturdy
                  oak, stood boldly out to the sight, casting their tall and deep shadows upon the <choice>
                     <sic>redish-brown</sic>
                     <corr>reddish-brown</corr>
                  </choice> waters of the whirling current. The sun's rays, no longer veiled by the
                  morning mist, illumined the valley of the stream, lending to the varied colors of
                  the autumn leaves its golden glare of azure, purple, yellow and brown, until the
                  whole extended range of the forest bottom became blended into one wild expanse of
                  scenery of exquisite and enchanting beauty. Deerheel could but exclaim, in the
                  ecstacy of his delight at the gorgeous view before him:</p>
               <p>"And this is the land of the savage, the wolf and the bear! a home fit for the
                  most civilized people in the world!"</p>
               <p>Led by Wacco, Deerheel followed up a narrow ravine for the distance of about a
                  mile, when they struck across a path which seemingly had not been used for many
                  months, but which they kept until they came to a wide plateau where the dried
                  grass of autumn spread, like a velvet carpet of yellow and brown, to the very
                  brink of the precipitous rocks.</p>
               <p>"We stand now on sacred ground," said Wacco; "here Modoc has often <choice>
                     <sic>harrangued</sic>
                     <corr>harangued</corr>
                  </choice> his warriors before leading then to battle against the whites, or some
                  neighboring tribe; here the prophet has expounded the laws of the tribe, and
                  interpreted the dreams of the chiefs, by which foretold victory or defeat; and
                  here, on certain feast days, the circle was made and the war dance performed by
                  the young braves."</p>
               <p>"Do they believe in the Great Spirit, and the happy hunting ground beyond the
                  grave?" asked the scout.</p>
               <p>"All of us Indians so believe," rejoined Wacco. "See here," said he, going to a
                  large slab of limestone rock, and then holding the scout by the arm so as to
                  prevent his further approach to it; "this is the priest's stone, the sacred stand
                  around which the tribe sat in council upon the affairs of the tribe, and from this
                  stone the sentences against offenders were proclaimed, and the officers of the law
                  were ordered to punish the criminals. But come, we may find a treasure in the way
                  of food: we will visit the old Indian store, where I am sure we will find a secure
                  retreat from Comanches, for since Modoc's death, so superstitious is an Indian,
                  nothing has been taken from this mountain."</p>
               <p>After this speech, Wacco led him toward a huge mass of granite rock, which stood
                  out in bold relief at the far end of the plateau, around the base of which the
                  young shoots of the oak were beginning to spread their tender branches, upon the
                  putting aside of which an opening was discovered, and as their shadows darkened
                  the aperture, a she-wolf, with hair bristled on her back, eyes glaring fiercely
                  wild, and jaws agape, rushed at them with a snarling bark, and would certainly
                  have bitten Wacco had not the scout instantly sent a slug from his revolver
                  through its neck bone. Upon an examination of this room in the rock, they found
                  six whelps which the Indian destroyed with some hesitation. This accounted for the
                  savage rage with which the she-wolf had assailed them, as this animal, unless
                  driven to it by hunger, seldom attacks man—be he red or white.</p>
               <p>"This place was once an Indian store," said Wacco; "the last time some of our
                  people came to buy provisions, they sold acorns, pecan-nuts, dried meat of the
                  buffalo, the deer, bear and antelope, muscal wine and mesquite bread, and other
                  things that could be bought at the Fort. You see all this is gone now—devoured by
                  beasts or birds, else they have rotted away. However, you can remain while I go
                  and bring up the blankets, for we will be safe here from weather and from Indians.
                  You will find just below that oak some mortar-holes in the rock, where the cooking
                  was done; you will find these holes, no doubt full of rain water. I will look for
                  the spring when I return."</p>
               <p>Without saying more, he took his rifle and went to the morning's camping to bring
                  up the traps.</p>
               <p>When the Indian had departed, the scout, exhausted in mind with harrassing fears
                  concerning the fate of Miss Carmine, and wearied by the exercise of the previous
                  day's travel, sat himself down upon a small pile of pine bark, and as the
                  influence of the sun's rays is always somniferous upon man or beast, he soon
                  forgot his trials and dangers, and the world was to him as that which is not. He
                  slept in the profoundness of deep sleep. Several hours passed away down the swift
                  current of time's ceaseless flow, when he awoke; but, as with all experienced
                     scouts,<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5694-00000016"/> he moved not a limb, and
                  listened attentively to take heed lest some lurking foe was near and should
                  discover his defenseless position, and ere he could grasp his weapon hurl him into
                  eternity. On many previous occasions of extreme peril, he indulged few
                  apprehensions for his safety. Now a new claim to further existence seemed to take
                  possession of his soul, and he hourly grew more eager to live. Miss Carmine must
                  be rescued from her savage captors, and through his agency alone. And then the
                  inquiries were forced upon his attention: "For what purpose? and to become whose
                  wife?" His very soul would sicken within him, and he would strive to avert his
                  thoughts from the object of his most cherished hopes of future happiness.
                  Cautiously he moved his foot, when the sharp singing of the rattle-snake's music
                  startled his ears. The truth instantly flashed upon his mind that the danger of
                  losing his life was more imminent than in any previous moment of his existence.
                  The pile of rubbish and bark upon which he had rested his body harbored a
                  rattle-snake which had now drawn itself from its cover to bask in the warm
                  sunshine of the advancing day. He became convinced, from a slight pressure below
                  the thigh, that the deadly reptile was coiled slightly under his leg, drawn there
                  by the natural warmth of his body. His previous movement, he was aware, had placed
                  the snake upon his guard; that any further stir upon his part might cause him to
                  receive the reptile's fatal fangs in his flesh, and then good-bye to Lucy Carmine,
                  and all the hopes and fears which centered around her being. He devised many plans
                  for delivering himself from the unexpected and deadly enemy. To collect his
                  strength and nimbly bound to his feet, to roll away his body from it by a quick
                  evolution, he thought of; but he saw at a glance that the attempt might end his
                  existence. So lying as motionless as possible, listening to the quick, loud
                  beatings of his own heart, while the sweat ran in great drops from his forehead,
                  he waited, with intense agony of mind, the return of Wacco, who soon made his
                  appearance, and, upon perceiving the danger in which his friend was placed,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"You have chosen a nice, pretty bed-fellow! Hist! he is flourishing his tail! it
                  means he is preparing for battle." And then no more words were spoken until the
                  quick report of Wacco's rifle relieved the scout from his peril and the snake of
                  its head.</p>
               <p>"We are now equal, Wacco," said the scout, giving his companion a warm embrace;
                  "we have bestowed life for life."</p>
               <p>"Pooh!" said the Indian; "had he bitten you, I could have cured you with our
                  snake-weed; unless," he added, "white man is different blood from Indian."</p>
               <p>The balance of the day, and the tedious night that followed, at last brought
                  relief to the hunter, for, taking their blankets, they descended the ravine, and
                  after mounting their horses, went once more in search of a trail leading to some
                  Comanche village. Three hours' riding at a walking pace, brought them to a path
                  which led to an open range of land, timberless but stony, where they saw a strange
                  looking individual approaching, leading a gray horse. As he drew near, Wacco soon
                  recognized him to be Walsh, the interpreter at the Fort. He was leading Carmine's
                  gray pony, and was dressed in a full suit of mountain goat, with cap of a gray
                  fox-skin. The most cordial greeting ensued. Among other scraps of news from the
                  Fort, they were informed that Lucy's mother was much improved, but that Carmine
                  was as one demented, and constantly called for his child and cursed Deerheel.</p>
               <p>"I cannot imagine why he bears such a hatred toward me," replied the scout; "I
                  never yet wronged him."</p>
               <p>"He thinks you have, no doubt. Your name is Crampton?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the scout.</p>
               <p>"Your father was in the last war with England—an officer?"</p>
               <p>"Precisely," answered the scout.</p>
               <p>"And shot a soldier in the ranks—on parade—on pretense of mutiny, and that soldier
                  a rival of his for the hand of a certain lady? And," continued Walsh, "your father
                  was tried and acquitted, and afterwards resigned his commission in the regular
                  service?"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>I DO NOT KNOW," said the scout. "I was too young then to give much
                  attention to those things. I believe that my father was an honorable soldier and
                  that my mother received her pension from the government regularly. But more I
                  cannot say. They have both been many years dead. If such had been the case, I
                  wonder I did not hear of it in after life."</p>
               <p>"It might have been hushed up," added Walsh. "I only mention it to you; but I
                  gained this information from hearing Carmine one day speaking to himself when he
                  thought no one was near. And as I have heard him say that he lost an elder brother
                  in the war, probably his death may be connected with his enmity against you."</p>
               <p>The scout was silent, but his thoughts were busy. If such were the case, what
                  business had he to further hazard his existence in pursuit of the girl? What was
                  it to Carmine if he did assist in rescuing her from captivity? He would never
                  recognize him as his son-in-law; and yet, strange! he was well received and kindly
                  treated by the trader in his more youthful days! Had he only heard of the affair
                  when he treated him with coldness? If not, why this change in his feelings toward
                  him?</p>
               <p>"I suppose," he asked, after a few moments of painful silence, "you are going to
                  seek the girl?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied Walsh. "I have been on your trail. I desire to aid you if I can, as
                  you once rendered me a great service in securing my money, when stolen and hidden
                  away by Mac, the gambler. I shall return to the Fort after putting you on the
                  trail to the village; but one favor I ask of you—at any time, never mention my
                  name. Now follow me."</p>
               <p>"You can depend upon me," said the scout. "I am not naturally open on the wing.
                  But have you heard nothing concerning the girl?"</p>
               <p>"Only this," replied Walsh: "that Carmine, in truth, does not wish you to succeed
                  upon the old score I have just mentioned, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Wish or no wish," rejoined Deerheel, "her mother has always been my friend, and
                  the girl my favorite."</p>
               <p>The interpreter shook his head, and then added:</p>
               <p>"You have but one alternative, in case you free the girl: bid the trader defiance.
                  There is not an officer in the Fort who will not approve your opposition to his
                  will and aid you in a private marriage."</p>
               <p>"You mistake me, friend Walsh!" quickly replied the hunter; "I am on an errand of
                  mercy to the living. Thus to act would be substituting one evil for another; and
                  besides, I know Miss Carmine's sense of duty toward her parents too well, not to
                  believe that she would scorn such a proposal."</p>
               <p>"As you will," replied Walsh, "but be not so boisterous in your speech; we are not
                  far from where enemies may beset our path."</p>
               <p>Wacco, who was last in the single-file along the path, watched every movement of
                  the interpreter. He seemed, of all, least satisfied. His piercing black eyes shown
                  with demoniac luster, while Walsh was conversing with his companion. He was not
                  only angered, but enraged to a degree that not even his native Indian stolidity
                  could conceal or restrain. But the scout saw not his change of countenance, for he
                  was earnestly conversing with Walsh, who led the way upon Carmine's pony. It was
                  about an hour before sunset when the interpreter struck the trail leading, as he
                  said, to the new village or settlement of the Comanche.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5694-00000018"/>
               <p>"You see this trail," he continued, as he pointed with his rifle up a wide ravine,
                  leading up the side of a gently sloping mountain, "that is your road. Your real
                  danger now begins. You had better be concealed and send the Indian to find out if
                  the girl is at the village. Depend upon it: diplomacy is better than fighting. You
                  know the plan: Find out where the girl is held a prisoner, and then if the Colonel
                  cannot ransom her, he will surround the village, attack at daylight, and rescue
                  her by main force. And," continued the interpreter, as he halted his horse, "we
                  thoroughly understand each other, and have a fair set off; as the Indian says, in
                  point of favors. I must leave you; but mind," he added with a cautious and
                  steadfast glance, "not a syllable that I have met you; so good-bye. Success to
                  you! may the girl be yours and you her rescuer!"</p>
               <p>Saying which, he rode off in a cantering gait, and so continued to widen the
                  distance between himself and his friend, until the gray steed was shut out from
                  view by a curving bend in the road through the chaparral.</p>
               <p>"No good! no buffalo; only skin!" broke in Wacco, in two short, quick
                  sentences.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said the scout, as he turned and looked the Indian intently in the face,
                  "you distrust him!" for he answered his friend in Spanish.</p>
               <p>"No good; bad man!" continued Wacco in broken sentences: for it was only when much
                  excited that he used English words. "No deer-skin; no turkey-buzzard! wolf; snake;
                  no good man! Me no go trail! bad way! Comanche catch Deerheel, Wacco!" And then he
                  motioned to his friend to alight and tie their horses in the chaparral, above
                  which, at unequal distances, the bastard oak thrust its stunted body and crooked
                  limbs. Every movement of the Indian indicated suspicion.</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible?" mused the hunter; "Can Wacco's doubts of Walsh's honesty be
                  correct? He must be mistaken! For what cause could he act the traitor? Has he not
                  frankly told me of Carmine's hatred, and the best plan to relieve his daughter?
                  And did he not say, 'trust not your person in the village; send Wacco; avoid
                  fighting?' Surely, had he intended me evil he would have advised the contrary. No,
                  I'll not believe it! When I give my confidence I'll do so in whole, and if I am
                  deceived let the worst come of it!"</p>
               <p>These thoughts he fully recounted to Wacco, but he only got for answer:</p>
               <p>"May be so; may be not so; may be no fox!"</p>
               <p>Having securely hid away their traps, they resolved to thoroughly examine the
                  surrounding ground. Suddenly, as they proceeded, Wacco, who was some distance in
                  advance, turned to the right, and then motioning to the scout to hide from view,
                  he crawled up the side of a ridge of rocks and slyly glanced around. Here he
                  remained some twenty minutes or more, and then, with the <choice>
                     <sic>gutheral</sic>
                     <corr>guttural</corr>
                  </choice> sound "ugh!" to which only an Indian can give utterance, he slid quietly
                  and imperceptibly down to his former position, and crawling to where the scout was
                  lying ensconced, he whispered:</p>
               <p>"Walsh—wolf!"</p>
               <p>He then explained to his friend that they were caught in a trap set by Carmine,
                  Powderhorn Joe and Walsh, and they were completely surrounded by Indians, and
                  that, though an Indian could escape by mingling with and passing out as one of
                  them, Deerheel would certainly be taken unless he would be governed by his advice.
                  The hunter readily consented to do his bidding, whereupon the Indian caused him to
                  despoil himself of his ammunition, pistol and hunting-knife, and also his rifle.
                  He then led him for near an hundred yards along the edge of one of the foot hills,
                  when, suddenly stopping beside a long, narrow hole, caused by a tree being torn up
                  by its roots, all of which, with the body and limbs, had long since decayed
                  away.</p>
               <p>"You here," said Wacco; "go to sleep; I come—night come; moon wake you; Wacco no
                  come, go up."</p>
               <p>Whenever the scout's friend wished to be seriously in earnest he always endeavored
                  to express himself in "Americanos," as he styled it. Without the least hesitation,
                  the scout measured his length in the hole, when the Indian brought leaves and
                  grass and strewed them over him, also some branches of a fallen oak tree, together
                  with some fragments of rocks to keep the mass pressed down. He then bent the
                  chaparral bushes over him. After closely examining his work, he gave his usual
                  Indian grunt of<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5694-00000019"/> satisfaction; then
                  proceedings to the horses he led them by a curving route past the hole for as long
                  a distance as he thought answered his purpose, and then left them, after taking
                  off the bridle and saddle belonging to the hunter's horse. The accoutrements he
                  hid away as best he could, and with as much hurry as he had buried his friend.
                  Striking a straight course at right angles to the mountain range of hills, until
                  he reached the edge of the chaparral, he squatted very low, and eagerly and most
                  anxiously awaited the war-cry of the Comanche, for he knew their circling line of
                  warriors would soon close in upon the trail and then the minutest search would be
                  urged for themselves and their horses. It was not long before his expectant fears
                  were realized. Nearer and more near came shouts and answering whoops, until a
                  complete circle seemed to be formed, and cries and shouts were blended in one
                  confused and solid mass of voices.</p>
               <p>"They have found the horses," quietly and rightly surmised Wacco; "they will
                  search in vain for Deerheel. Now's Indian's chance."</p>
               <p>And then, in a stooping posture, he ran along the edges of the brush until he
                  struck the Comanche trail, with which he mingled his own moccasin tracks. He then
                  seated himself behind some rocks, expecting that as night was advancing, the
                  Indians would relinquish the search until morning. The varied and brilliant luster
                  of the clouds gave evident signs that the autumn day was fast drawing to its
                  close. The forest leaves, already moistened by the moist damp of dew, and
                  unruffled by the faintest evening zephyr, reflected across the stream the lustrous
                  glow of the parting sunbeams, as glazing the neighboring rocks and hills with a
                  splendor of coloring as extended as it was soothing in its effulgence. After the
                  boisterous and startling search a profound silence ensued, save when an occasional
                  bark from the squirrel expressed his joy at the subdued aspect of all surrounding
                  objects and his freedom from all fears of harm from man or beast. This moment,
                  while Wacco sat with his elbows resting upon his knees and forehead held by the
                  palms of his hands intently listening, he heard the bark of the Indian wolf dog,
                  when he sprang to his feet, scrambled up the steep hill-side, and then turning for
                  an instant, as the dog's howl continued, he threw himself upon the ground,
                  exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Deerheel live no more! Powderhorn Joe shoot him!"</p>
               <p>But though he heard a confused hum of many voices, he listened in vain for the
                  expectant shot which was to send the spirit of his friend into the happy
                  hunting-ground. The first impulse of the Indian was to follow Walsh and kill him.
                  Revenge is the leading passion of the Indian when he has been injured or has a
                  wrong to redress. But he now heard the Comanche horsemen advancing; so gliding
                  down the steep hill, as near as prudent to the trail, he awaited with the most
                  excited fears and eager solicitude the passing of the long single-file of
                  horsemen. There were some twenty warriors in all, and, as the last flush of
                  twilight glowed for a moment upon the tips of their lances as they moved silently
                  along, he counted their horses, and knew by the riderless break in their line,
                  near the middle, that his and the scout's horses had been taken; and then came
                  along a form without spear or shield—fixed, motionless, upon a pony. This form he
                  rightly surmised was the scout, tied to the horse. The instinct of the savage, in
                  chase or war, possesses an acuteness far surpassing that of his more civilized
                  white brother; nor did Wacco deceive himself when he proclaimed aloud in silent
                  sorrow:</p>
               <p>"Deerheel no go to the Fort; Walsh no make trap for white man—no make trap for
                  Indian no more!"</p>
               <p>The demon of revenge took possession of his soul, and so intensely infuriated did
                  he become; so consuming was this resolve in his breast, that it seemed to melt
                  away all other passions and instincts of a wilder type of being, and he frothed at
                  the mouth, and then casting his body upon the ground, he gnashed his teeth, and
                  drove the blade of his hunting-knife deep into the rocky soil. And then to be thus
                  foiled in his attempt to save the scout, by the wolf-dog—an animal inferior all
                  respects to the Indian—stimulated his passion for vengeance and thirst for blood.
                  Life for life! the Indian motto; the Indian law, all the world over.</p>
               <p>While lying buried in his surface grave the scout heard the trampling of horses'
                  hoofs beat the ground near to his temporary tomb. His mind roved from subject to
                  subject. In vain he strove to fix his thoughts upon some topics of interest. They
                  would not be controlled, and it was just when he heard the<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000020"/> stealthy step of the dog toward his earthly abode
                  that he began to believe that the Indian's ruse had succeeded. His heart ceased to
                  beat for an instant, as he even smelt and felt the dog's very breath before it
                  opened, and as he did so he knew his discovery was certain. Still he remained
                  quiet, resolved to take the chances; but the canine's howl brought the nearest
                  foemen to the spot, until one, more curious than the rest, thrust his spear into
                  the upraised mass of brush and sticks, slightly pricking his arm, when the scout
                  bounded to his feet, scattering the loose leaves and brush in every direction. The
                  nearest Indians, startled by the sudden apparition, recoiled backwards, but it was
                  only for an instant, for Hosamarea, who had pressed his speer into the brush, knew
                  Deerheel and called upon him to stand—the Indians surrounding him with their
                  spears, and thus rendering <choice>

                     <corr>resistance</corr>

                     <sic>become</sic>
                     <corr>became</corr>
                  </choice> a prisoner to Hosamarea, chief and greatest warrior of the Comanche
                  nation. To the honor of the Comanche tribe—they never kill an unarmed prisoner. He
                  must be taken and tried before a council of chiefs; the wisdom of the nation must
                  first speak, and the sentence of death must go forth in peace, as the voice of the
                  Great Spirit expressed through the minds of the wisest and bravest warriors in
                  council assembled; and it was to this chivalric law and sacred adherence to it
                  that the scout owed his life. Hosamarea's orders were expressed in his native
                  tongue, which Deerheel did not understand. Remonstrance was useless, as they
                  placed the buck-skin badge across his eyes, and leading him forth to his own pony,
                  they forced him to mount. Fastening his arms behind him and tying his legs
                  securely by a thong of rawhide, reaching under and between his own saddle-girth,
                  his horse was urged along in the unbroken single-file of horsemen, with no ray of
                  light from moon or star to cheer his heart, while being led to death or prolonged
                  captivity.</p>
               <p>After Walsh had placed his dupe, Deerheel, in a secure position to be taken, he
                  retired, as we have seen, behind the chaparral, and then, by a circuitous route,
                  he reached the Indian band, headed by Hosamarea, and which, by appointment, had
                  agreed to meet him at a certain place; and there he met them, and notified the
                  chief of the presence of the scout and Wacco. Hid from view, he eagerly watched
                  the capture of Deerheel, for he was not the man to return to the Fort upon a mere
                  surmise or supposition that they would of a certainty be taken. He was a
                  matter-of-fact personage. Nothing but a hard, stubborn fact—an actual
                  occurrence—would satisfy him on any venture or business transaction. He witnessed
                  the Indians returning to their village with the victim of his perfidy, and then,
                  after a hurried interview with Powderhorn Joe, who had not joined in the chase for
                  fear of being recognized by the scout, he took his departure for the trader's
                  abode. Carmine's gray pony carried him swiftly through brush-bramble and over
                  treeless plains until the evening of the third day he came within sight of the
                  tall stone buildings of the Fort. His horse being jaded, he himself wearied beyond
                  any previous trial of endurance of travel, he cast himself from his heated saddle,
                  then quenching his thirst from a small stream of water which crossed the road with
                  a sluggish current, and suffering his steed to indulge the same luxury, he urged
                  his course towards the trader's station near the out-buildings of the cavalry.
                  Giving the reins in charge of one of the employees, then seeking a glass of whisky
                  and imbibing to his heart's content, he sought the trader's house where he met a
                  hearty welcome. Mrs. Carmine was seated in a large arm-chair, looking pale and
                  nervous, from the effects of her recent but now rapidly healing wound; the glow of
                  the sinking sun lending a momentary flush to her handsome features, when the
                  interpreter entered. The trader received him standing near the fire, with his
                  elbow resting upon the rough mantel-board, firmly fixed into the unplastered
                  chimney-bricks.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Walsh! my dear friend!" he exclaimed as he advanced toward that person; "I am
                  gladder to see you than an angel! I trust, in the name of humanity, you bring us
                  good news!"</p>
               <p>"Good news, and more!" he answered, as, blandly smiling, he grasped the trader's
                  extended hand.</p>
               <p>"O, my child! my child, Lucy! Speak; tell me in truth. before high Heaven! that
                  you speak not false! will she be restored to us?"</p>
               <p>Saying these words, Mrs. Carmine endeavored to rise from her chair to greet the
                  interpreter, but strength and spirit failed her,<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000021"/> and she swooned away in her seat, as livid as a
                  corpse. Carmine and Walsh rendered immediate attention. The nurse was summoned,
                  and when she had recovered, the trader led his dastardly agent to his room, where
                  he usually transacted his private business. Carmine threw a military cloak over
                  his shoulders, for the air was bracing cold, and then offered one to the
                  interpreter, but the latter being warmed up by the fire-water intended for the
                  Indians, refused any further covering during the interview.</p>
               <p>"Sit near me," said the trader after closing the door and placing a chair near his
                  own for Walsh. The latter slowly complied with the request, for his limbs were
                  stiff and sore from the ride.</p>
               <p>"Well," began Walsh, "you see I soon struck their trail. They must have made a
                  slow walk of it, or rested on the way, and, bless you! if it had been planned out
                  for them on a map, they could not have hit the direction better. There had once
                  been a little favor rendered me by this scout, and I readily imposed my good
                  services upon him as though to cancel the obligation. He proved an innocent
                  sucker, and I easily led them into the trap. I saw him captured with my own eyes,
                  and saw him tied upon his own horse and doubly guarded by Hosamarea and his
                  warriors, and led a captive to their village, which will be the last you will ever
                  hear of him. Depend upon it, you will never hear of him more; you may find his
                  grave, but never Crampton a living body."</p>
               <p>And the interpreter smiled a knowing glance, and was about to continue, the trader
                  stopped him by saying:</p>
               <p>"You have gone too fast! What of your arrangements with Powderhorn Joe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was too fast; amazingly so! Of course I visited the village before I went
                  to the scout in person. I knew where to find him and that trusty fool, Wacco.
                  This, of course, was necessary first of all. However, a goodly crowd of people
                  gathered round me when I so unexpectedly entered the village, but I was soon
                  directed to Powderhorn Joe's tent."</p>
               <p>"Did you see my daughter?" anxiously asked the trader.</p>
               <p>"We'll come to that directly," answered Walsh.</p>
               <p>"No directly about it!" excitedly reiterated the trader.</p>
               <p>"Well, yes sir," replied the agent, "but by-and-by as to that."</p>
               <p>"I say, was she a wife to any of those beasts? or still"—Carmine hesitated to
                  speak further.</p>
               <p>"Still secure, and safe from outrage," rejoined the agent.</p>
               <p>The trader had turned his back upon Walsh while asking the question, and his frame
                  shook with inward emotion; but when his question was answered, he quickly turned
                  his glowing face upon the interpreter:</p>
               <p>"Then, in God's name! she is indeed safe! for they want money—gold! silver! This I
                  have in abundance, and it shall prove the sword that shall restore her to liberty!
                  Now go on, and tell of your agreement with Powderhorn Joe."</p>
               <p>"Well, he seemed loth to part with her. At first, he said that he would have to
                  consult the tribe. I told him that the chief had informed me that she was his own
                  captive; that no law could take her from him, and that he could do with her as he
                  pleased; and more especially, as he was a naturalized chief among them, and stood
                  high on the list for bravery, none would dare to attempt it. He said that was all
                  true; but that he had lost heavily at gambling, and she was in part pledged for
                  his debts. I told him to name his price. He wanted ten thousand at first, but I
                  told him I would only give half the sum. He grew indignant, and strongly insisted.
                  After awhile he went out and returned, and told me that he was so pressed by his
                  creditors that he would be compelled to take the sum. I then asked to be shown
                  your daughter. To this he consented, but would let me hold no conversation with
                  her. He then led me to another part of the village, to a large-sized tent, and
                  raised up the curtain before the entrance, when I saw her in company with another
                  white woman. He says she will speak to no one, and often cries; and does not seem
                  to pay any attention when spoken to."</p>
               <p>"Say nothing of this to any one," said the trader, as he wiped the copious flow of
                  tears from his cheeks "Of course you will start with the money to-morrow,
                  Walsh?"</p>
               <p>"I'm slightly fatigued," replied Walsh, drawing his feet slowly together. "I
                  should like to have a few days to warm the stiffness out of me; but I believe
                  myself capable, if absolutely<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5694-00000022"/> necessary,
                  to stand as much as any other man on those plains; but I can't see that anything
                  is likely to spoil by just a little delay. Your daughter is as likely to be well
                  treated now, and more so—since we are in treaty for her person. Another thing, she
                  may have time to recover her speech, for I am told she is as deaf as a pumpkin;"
                  and then he gaped and folded his arms across his chest.</p>
               <p>"I've listened to you attentively, Walsh. There's some show in your excuse for not
                  starting on your return trip to-morrow; but, mark ye! there's those who can plan
                  and those who can understand the object of a plan: You want extra pay. I have
                  promised you a thousand; you shall have double that amount if you set off
                  to-morrow with the pack-mules to carry the money."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll try it, Mr. Carmine," said Walsh, straightening up his form with his
                  usual nervous manner. "I suppose you feel anxious. I'll not have so far to
                  ride—only to Wolf creek, where Powderhorn Joe and Hosamarea are to deliver over
                  your daughter."</p>
               <p>"But are you sure? for after you pay the money they may refuse to surrender my
                  daughter," said Mr. Carmine with a hesitating tone of voice.</p>
               <p>"Not in the least. It would spoil the trade, and Powderhorn Joe knows too well the
                  importance of complying with his contracts in matters of trade. See here, Mr.
                  Carmine, this Powderhorn Joe is not only one of the most unscrupulous, but also
                  one of the shrewdest and best business men in the station. Depend on it, we will
                  have no difficulty in obtaining full satisfaction for our wrong."</p>
               <p>"I have my suspicions," replied the trader; "he came too readily into your terms.
                  He was long-headed when in my employ, and has lost nothing by a few lessons in
                  Indian rascality. I trust it may all be right, but I have my doubts;" and then,
                  after a pause, he added: "There is no other alternative; we must run the risk;
                  'tis but a small amount to venture in such an affair. Get you to bed, Walsh; I
                  will see to the packing of the money, and will furnish you with a fresh horse, as
                  the Colonel may stand in need of the gray during your absence."</p>
               <p>The interpreter took his departure, exulting over his maneuverings verings to get
                  an additional reward out of the trader, and Carmine hastened to his anxious wife
                  to assure her of the speedy return to their arms of their only child.</p>
               <p>About a day and a half's ride from the Fort would bring a swift horseman to the
                  banks of Wolf creek. A small stream of water flows over its gravelly bed during
                  the spring and winter seasons. but through the whole of the long summer months
                  little if any water is to be seen in its channel, save in a few holes, which are
                  easily discovered by the thick underbrush and stunted growth of oak and
                  cotton-wood trees. At certain hours of the day and night, the deer, antelope and
                  buffalo were accustomed to visit these pools of stagnant water and quench their
                  thirst, and it was at the largest of these springs, as the Indian called them,
                  that the place of meeting had been agreed upon for the exchange to take place—the
                  payment of the money and the surrender of Miss Carmine's body.</p>
               <p>Now Walsh was really used up from the hard riding of the last week, and upon
                  leaving the Fort on the morning following his return he trotted briskly along,
                  driving his pack-mules ahead of his own horse; and only when one of his Indian
                  attendants strayed from the path to kill some enticing game, was he heard to utter
                  a word beyond a whisper, either to man or beast. Miss Carmine's misfortune had
                  proved his good fortune. The trader's daughter once rescued from the savages and
                  two thousand dollars in his own pocket, he would not only, in his own estimation,
                  be rich, but quite a border hero—a man to be both envied and admired.</p>
               <p>Leaving the interpreter, with his guard of Indians, to pursue his journey, we
                  invite the reader's attention to the point on the creek before mentioned: The time
                  is the third day after Walsh has started on his way to meet Powderhorn Joe and
                  Hosamarea. Reclining upon the ground, with his head resting upon his hand, was
                  seen Hosamarea, the ablest and most politic of the Comanche chiefs. He was dressed
                  in full war uniform; his buckskin breeches extended to his knees, and were fringed
                  and beautifully worked with beads, as were his moccasins, and also the glazed belt
                  around his waist; his hair was black and coarse, being only moderately long; his
                  body was naked above the waist, having a<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5694-00000023"/>
                  broad buckskin belt slung over his left shoulder, which was decorated by fancy
                  work of the feathers of various birds and different colored glass beads; his eyes
                  were rather large and not so deeply set in his skull as other Indians, and, though
                  they were piercing black, yet his complexion was of a bright copper color.
                  Covering his head was a helmet made of buckskin, with a bunch of eagle feathers
                  adorning the front. His form possessed great symmetry of mould, and, when
                  standing, his figure was striking and manly. His lance was lying near him, and his
                  rifle was placed against a tree, within easy reach of his long muscular arms. The
                  tones of his voice were rich and mellow in their utterance, and he was joking and
                  laughing at Powderhorn Joe, who stood sullenly watching in the direction in which
                  he expected to witness the coming of the interpreter.</p>
               <p>"Your Walsh is a badger, and has dug a hole in the ground and hid his money,
                  Powderhorn," said the chief banteringly to that worthy. "He's got the trader's
                  money and gone to California to hide himself away, and what you owe me I'll never
                  get, unless you pay me in the next hunting abode above;" and the chief's sides
                  really shook with laughter, as he marked the scowl of disapprobation which
                  darkened the trader's visage.</p>
               <p>"You may laugh," retorted Lucy's captor; "but no man ever insulted or wronged me
                  but what he got his quietus in the end."</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>YES; if you could catch him, no doubt," replied the chief between
                  his laughing spells; "but he's not the louse to be caught near such a head as
                  yours; and then, should he act the simpleton and bring us the money, what will the
                  trader say?" and the chief broke out into a wild shout of laughter, in which the
                  warriors of his band joined, and then he sprung to his feet and danced around his
                  lance, in which the others followed suit. Even Powderhorn could not restrain his
                  laughter at the chief's last remark—and sat himself down near the path.</p>
               <p>Hosamarea, when among his people spoke their language, and when conversing with
                  the whites, used that of Spain. The traitor chief had gotten his name by
                  carelessly letting his powderhorn fall into the camp-fire, when it exploded and
                  peppered the skin on his face and cheeks, and caused him for a long time to lose
                  the sight of his left eye. He was a heavy-set man, with large Roman nose,
                  out-spread jaws and repulsive features; but a schemer and trickster of untiring
                  energy, and, withal, a notorious gambler. One hour the chief bantered Powderhorn,
                  at the end of which the interpreter drew within sight, and they all hastened to
                  meet him and his escort.</p>
               <p>"It's my turn to laugh," said the traitor, as he sent a derisive glance at the now
                  serious countenance of the chief. "O, ho! you smell the eagles; you would like to
                  give the birds a resting place in your pockets?"</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5694-00000024"/>
               <p>"Only pay my debt and I am satisfied. The girl is yours; the money will be yours,"
                  replied the chief; and then he laughed immoderately, and added: "what will the
                  trader say?" and again his merry mirth was heard, much to Powderhorn's
                  annoyance.</p>
               <p>Walsh had rested on the road. Once beyond the observation of the inmates of the
                  Fort, he sought, in some secluded retreat, that repose of which his exhausted
                  nature stood so much in need, and this was the cause of his delay in arriving at
                  the point of destination. On spying the assembled band of warriors, he directed
                  his course toward them, and not till he had dismounted from his horse and secured
                  the mules, did any of Powderhorn's men advance toward him. Indian discipline
                  forbids any one to speak except the chief, who now lighted his pipe and, after
                  taking a whiff or two, passed it to Powderhorn, and then to Walsh, and then to the
                  Indians who followed the interpreter from the Fort, who passed it separately to
                  those of the Comanche band of warriors. Hosamarea then spoke as follows:</p>
               <p>"We greet our good friend, the interpreter; he has acted the part of a brave
                  warrior; he has kept his word; he is a friend to the Comanche nation; the stars
                  will light him by night, when in the woods and on the prairie; the sun will warm
                  him; the snow will drive the bear from the mountains, and the owl will tell him,
                  by its whoop when the deer is feeding to get his meat; the rain will cool the air
                  for him in summer, and melt the snow in winter for him; and the moon will blind
                  his enemies when they lay wait for him. Our squaws shall dry the meat for him. and
                  the Great Spirit will watch over him in health."</p>
               <p>After this speech, he shook hands with him, as also did Powderhorn and the rest of
                  the warriors.</p>
               <p>"You brought the money?" asked Powderhorn, in Spanish, for he was loth to excite
                  the suspicions of Hosamarea by speaking in his native tongue, English.</p>
               <p>"I did," replied Walsh, looking indignant, "and you, Powderhorn, should be the
                  last to ask such a question; I have brought every cent of the money—the full five
                  thousand. But I do not see the girl."</p>
               <p>"She is here," said the traitor, "but as deaf and silent as ever, since the scare
                  I gave her when I carried her off."</p>
               <p>"Produce the girl," said Carmine's agent, and we'll count the money."</p>
               <p>Hosamarea gave a shrill whistle, when two Indians led forth one of the ponies
                  which they had taken from Deerheel and Wacco, and then another smaller horse was
                  brought out from the brush, upon which sat a lady closely veiled and of rather
                  small stature. She was seated upon a lady's saddle, of English make, and seemed
                  familiar to horseback exercise, by the graceful ease with which she carried her
                  body.</p>
               <p>"Are you Miss Carmine?" said the interpreter, as he went up to her and offered his
                  hand, which, though she warmly grasped, she uttered never a word. Walsh had
                  addressed her in English. He now repeated his inquiry in Spanish, but received no
                  answer—in fact she appeared not to notice that he had even opened his lips, much
                  less heard his words.</p>
               <p>"It can't be helped, Powderhorn. I must take her as I find her. Perhaps a sight of
                  her parents may restore her hearing; and if that fails, the doctors then can try,
                  for the trader will spare no expense. Now let us count the money."</p>
               <p>The mules were unpacked, the twenty-dollar gold pieces quickly exposed to view,
                  and as hastily stowed away in Powderhorn's hunting-pouch. When the count was
                  closed and found correct, the interpreter seemed most anxious to be gone on his
                  journey, and the chiefs appeared as willing on their part that he should take his
                  departure; and thus, after the usual friendly shaking of hands and smoking the
                  pipe, Walsh, with his small band of Indians surrounding the trader's daughter,
                  turned the heads of their horses toward the Fort; and not many minutes had elapsed
                  before they were beyond hearing of the whoops of the Comanche people. It would be
                  too tedious to our readers if we were to too minutely describe the usual routine
                  of hourly travel on the plains; suffice it to say, that at sunset on the following
                  day, to the surprise of every one, Walsh was seen galloping rapidly toward the
                  Fort, leading a horse upon which sat a lady—with her head and face covered with a
                  green veil; the pony upon which she sat being urged forward by the pricking from
                  arrow-heads in the hands of the Indians following in the rear. So unexpected had
                  been his appearance, that the sentinel who admitted<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000025"/> him to pass forgot to challenge, but recovering his
                  presence of mind, he thrust back his followers at the point of the bayonet, and
                  then called the <choice>
                     <sic>sargeant</sic>
                     <corr>sergeant</corr>
                  </choice> of the guard. Straight to the trader's private dwelling the interpreter
                  led, or rather dragged, the lady's horse, and, when arrived before the open door,
                  he sprang from his horse, and, with practiced facility, lifted the lady from the
                  saddle, and then, clasping her tightly by the arm, hurried her into the room where
                  sat the trader and Mrs. Carmine, and several officers and their wives. At this
                  moment the horse the lady rode fell dead—ridden to death, which Walsh observed
                  not.</p>
               <p>"Carmine and wife mother and father! behold your daughter!" he exclaimed, as he
                  placed the veiled form, standing, before the company.</p>
               <p>"Heaven be praised!" faintly uttered Mrs. Carmine, as she clasped her hands and
                  fell upon her knees in prayer; while Carmine arose with the company, and, with
                  extended arms, hastened forward to embrace the girl, when she took a step
                  backward, exclaiming, as she tore the veil from her face and head:</p>
               <p>"Stand off! I am not, sir, your daughter, but I am free!" Carmine staggered
                  several steps sideways and would have fallen, had not the friendly arms of the
                  officers caught his reeling body.</p>
               <p>"Traitor! thief! villain! You shall pay for this brutal outrage!" he gasped, while
                  a shiver seemed to pass through his whole frame.</p>
               <p>Nor was Walsh less unnerved by the disclosure. He stood as one
                  stupefied—motionless, speechless.</p>
               <p>"Seize the scoundrel!" exclaimed several of the officers; and the interpreter was
                  dragged to the guard-house, without power to resist or give utterance to a single
                  syllable in his own behalf.</p>
               <p>The girl, apparently exhausted, had seated herself upon a chair, and giving vent
                  to a flood of tears, seemed deeply afflicted by the agonizing scene before her
                  moistened gaze. Several of the officers' wives now approached and led her from the
                  room into an adjoining apartment.</p>
               <p>We shall drop the curtain upon this mournful act in the drama of Carmine's life.
                  In the next chapter, in the girl's interview with Carmine on the following day,
                  much will be known concerning her history, and some account of her reasons for
                  consenting to be put upon the interpreter as Miss Carmine's person.</p>
               <p>From gathering darkness to lengthened morn, the interpreter found himself a
                  prisoner in the guard-house. Hourly he heard the perpetual tramp of the sentry
                  around his narrow prison, and most fearful grew his rage against the chief and the
                  traitor—but more especially the last. Stiff, sore and aching were his limbs, but
                  so great was his desire for vengeance that the half-breed interpreter stifled
                  their sensations of pain in his wild and burning thoughts for everlasting revenge.
                  And the girl! who could she be? But yet no thought of making war against a woman
                  entered his mind. Occasionally, a stolid sense of weariness mastered his agitated
                  mind, and, in a half-waking dream, the traitor was beneath his feet, and he was
                  sending his hunting-knife deep into the villain's chest; and then again, he would
                  start, into consciousness, only to find his wretched spirit still brooding over
                  his great misfortunes. While thus incarcerated, his perfidy had been discussed by
                  the officers of the garrison, and Carmine received all the sympathy which could
                  possibly be afforded him by his numerous friends.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carmine, when she ascertained the continued captivity of her child, and knew
                  of the cheat which had been practiced upon their confiding natures, was taken
                  seriously ill, and her life despaired of by the attending surgeons.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IT was arranged that early the next morning the girl should be
                  questioned and closely examined, to ascertain how far Walsh was implicated in this
                  villainous trick; this cruel imposition.</p>
               <p>At last a night of exciting anxiety passed away, and the sun, with his usual
                  splendor, gilded the windows of the Fort. When brought before the Colonel, Carmine
                  and officers, she appeared quite refreshed, and little intimidated by the presence
                  of her examiners.</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" asked the Colonel; "and whence came you?"</p>
               <p>"Marie Bodroc," was the prompt reply. "I am now—or was yesterday—a prisoner in the
                  camp of Hosamarea."</p>
               <p>"How came you there; and who brought you here?" again asked her examiner.</p>
               <p>"I will tell you in a few words," she replied, in a soft, peculiar accent: "I was
                  traveling with my husband in Mexico. Know, Messieurs, I am an actress—a French
                  woman. I was on my way with my company to the City of Mexico, to perform before
                  the president; a band of robbers attacked us; we were overpowered; the men were
                  killed, and the robbers carried us—the women—to their den, where they cast dice
                  for us. I was drawn by the brother to the captain of this mountain band, and
                  carried to a neighboring village—I should think an hundred miles from the road—and
                  placed under the control of a Mexican hag, who watched me with Argus eyes. I was
                  visited frequently by the robber, and became his wife, when I was treated with
                  much less rigor and with more attention. One night the whole village was a mass of
                  noise, screams, shouts, shots and cries of distress, until the very air seemed
                  filled with the cries of murder and horror. Then came the hurried tramp of men
                  running, and shooting as they ran. Soon my door was bursted open. I heard the cry
                  of, Indians! Indians! from all quarters. At that moment I was seized by a rude and
                  unknown hand, dragged into the street, and I soon found myself in the arms of an
                  Indian, who, mounted upon a fleet animal, bore me, before him, to the mountains. I
                  fully realized my position: I was again a prisoner—captured from my robber husband
                  by a ruthless savage! I don't know that I should call these people savages. Though
                  thieves and robbers, they are very intelligent and seem to know of every thing
                  passing upon the borders of this country and Mexico—but to return to my
                  misfortunes: I was carried to the camp of one of the great chiefs of the Comanche
                  nation, and again became a wife, by force, to a stranger and a thief. Sometime
                  after this, I traveled with this band of Indians from camp to camp, when my captor
                  took sick and died. I was then sold, by the order of the chief, and the
                  purchase-money was given to my husband's first squaw. I was purchased by a
                  relative of Hosamarea, taken to his camp and won from him at a gambling game by
                  Powderhorn Joe, and was his wife at the time yonder gentleman's daughter was
                  brought into camp." </p>
               <p>"But how came you to be imposed on Walsh, and was Walsh knowing to the
                  deception?"</p>
               <p>"I think not," she replied with much nonchalance, and which only a French actress
                  could assume. "I was greatly amused at his ignorance, and could scarcely restrain
                  my laughter at his innocence, since he made such extraordinary and marvelous signs
                  to make me understand, and what was more ridiculous still, the Indians tried to
                  assist him to make me understand his meaning, and distorted their faces by the
                  most hideous grimaces, and twisted their fingers into as many curves as there are
                  links in a trace-chain."</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5694-00000027"/>
               <p>"How long have you feigned this dumbness?" inquired the Colonel.</p>
               <p>"Since the death of my last husband," she naively replied.</p>
               <p>"Which may that be?" remarked the Colonel, smiling.</p>
               <p>"The one preceding the purchase of myself by Powderhorn."</p>
               <p>"Will you have the goodness to tell us how our friend, Powderhorn treated
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Knowing my native tongue to be French—as you perceive by my accent—and knowing a
                  few words of the language, he would try to mimic a Frenchman, in performing the
                  most curious antics. Thus, by jumping round like one monkey and one frog. This he
                  only did when in a good humor. When things went wrong with him in the chase or on
                  the war-path, or when he lost at gambling, he would come home furious, and though
                  he spoke the Comanche language well, he usually swore in the English tongue. We
                  got to understand each other pretty well by signs, but he frequently wrote in a
                  book and gave it to me to read. In this way he promised me my freedom, and
                  explained to me the part I was to play in the exchange of my body for money.
                  Should I act my part to his satisfaction, I should have my freedom. If I failed, I
                  was to be buried alive! Now, Messieurs, when life and liberty were at stake—both
                  so dear to me—I willingly consented, and you will find that consent in his book in
                  my own hand-writing; yes, I consented to represent your daughter; and though I
                  grieve for you, yet I have passed through so much tribulation and sorrow! hard,
                  hard usage silenced all the better promptings of my nature. With no friend in the
                  world; no one loving or caring for me: with no friendly hand to give assistance;
                  no human being with whom I could advise, I had no thought but of liberty; no
                  sympathy for any living thing; and how I acted my part—with both white and red
                  man—Walsh can answer. Let him speak."</p>
               <p>The girl was dismissed from their presence with words less harsh than those with
                  which she had been previously addressed.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said Carmine, "I am a father—and may say, a grieving one—and my child
                  is still in captivity. I am a loser to the extent of over five thousand dollars; I
                  have been horribly disappointed, and am seriously troubled in mind at my wife's
                  illness—caused by this foul imposition, if imposition it was—but, candidly I
                  confess to you that I freely forgive this woman for using every and all means
                  within her power to regain her liberty, or save herself from a worse fate—nay, I
                  must say, I praise and admire her for it; for, were my daughter to practice the
                  same cunning, or accept the same terms of humbuggery to free herself from these
                  hell-hounds, I would laud her for it—nay, I would reward her to any extent within
                  my power."</p>
               <p>"And permit her to wed Deerheel!" exclaimed Walsh, who had been led into their
                  presence, by one of the guard, to be examined.</p>
               <p>The trader turned suddenly round, and then walking up to the interpreter, and
                  frowning darkly, whispered:</p>
               <p>"I qualify my promise, Walsh. Never!"</p>
               <p>Walsh described the surrender of the girl and his payment of the money, and told
                  them that the girl saw the money counted out; that if he had wished to act the
                  thief he never would have parted with a cent to such rascals; that he had never
                  seen the trader's daughter to know her, and never suspected that she was any other
                  person than represented to him by her captors; that he intended to return and get
                  the value of the money by taking the lives of both the chiefs.</p>
               <p>The interpreter was set at liberty—considered merely as a dupe and a swindler.</p>
               <p>Marie found quarters with the wife of one of the <choice>
                     <sic>sargeants</sic>
                     <corr>sergeants</corr>
                  </choice>, and when Mrs. Carmine was pronounced out of danger, she was sent for by
                  that most anxious of mothers, and questioned as to trivial matters concerning
                  Lucy. Mr. Carmine and some ladies were present when Marie was admitted.</p>
               <p>"She was brought in while I was there. Powderhorn calls her his lump of gold. A
                  chief of great fame offered to purchase her for many horses, but he only laughed
                  at him, and said she was worth more to him than a thousand ponies, and that so
                  long as he held her in his possession he was worth fifty thousand dollars. I was
                  kept from her for several days, until Lucy grew sick, when I was called to nurse
                  her, but I could say but little to her, for I was watched. She rapidly improved in
                  health until one morning Powderhorn entered the tent, and holding open the
                     curtain,<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5694-00000028"/> told us to look out, and we
                  saw a young American tied to a horse, and led near the tent when she fainted."</p>
               <p>"Do you know the name of the person of whom you have spoken; or did they call him
                  by any name?" asked Mrs. Carmine.</p>
               <p>"I did not know then, but I afterwards heard that he was called Deerheel, and that
                  they were delighted at his capture."</p>
               <p>"Deerheel!" groaned the mother; "Heavens above! then they have indeed got him as
                  Walsh had sworn "</p>
               <p>Seeing his patient weaken under the statement, the surgeon ordered the girl
                  removed until another, and more fitting occasion. Carmine had suddenly left the
                  room upon hearing Marie's confirmation of Deerheel's capture. He probably sought
                  the interpreter to congratulate him upon the event, and to grant his forgiveness
                  for losing the money.</p>
               <p>"I tell you what," said Walsh some days after his return, when walking with the
                  trader, "I do regret me much in the course I pursued in delivering up Deerheel. I
                  believe I was punished for it. He never did me any wrong, and I distinctly saw, in
                  a dream last night, his dead body pierced with arrows and thrown outside the camp,
                  and the dogs fighting around it for his flesh."</p>
               <p>"You are superstitious," replied Carmine; "you lost the money and with it
                  confidence in yourself. Men who commit crimes should first temper their
                  consciences for such deeds—else why commit them, deceiving both themselves and
                  their employers?"</p>
               <p>"That's true to a certain extent," replied Walsh doggedly; "but there is another
                  trouble in the way of which I did not think until this moment: Wacco was not
                  taken; and he gave me suspicious glances when I misled the scout. Suppose he'd
                  blow on us? Suppose Deerheel is killed? You know the Indian law is certain,
                  fixed—life for life! I say there's danger, Mr. Carmine; real, steadfast danger!
                  Don't you see it man? It's as plain as those trees!"</p>
               <p>"Well," replied Carmine, hesitatingly, "if you fear a man will kill you, why not
                  be beforehand with him? Certainly your life is dear enough for you to know how to
                  protect it?"</p>
               <p>"In a fair light, yes; and perhaps not in a fair fight. Depend upon it, if
                  Deerheel is killed Wacco will know it; and, as he knows the cause now, I say—and I
                  am no coward—that neither of us will see the hand which sends the arrow to our
                  hearts. You see I am not so superstitious as you have upbraided me with. What do
                  you think now about the subject? eh, Mr. Carmine? And further, suppose either of
                  us should be taken sick, and fearing death, confess to the crime, where would the
                  other be?"</p>
               <p>The trader eyed Walsh for a few moments with so searching a glance as to make the
                  interpreter avert his gaze, and then said:</p>
               <p>"Neither of us would be considered in our right senses; it would go for the
                  ravings of an expiring mind; a medley of discordant and confused ideas generated
                  by the fears of death. Don't you think so, Walsh?"</p>
               <p>A call-boy summoned the trader to dinner, and thus ended the conversation. Walsh
                  continued to ramble in the neighborhood of the Fort until night arrived, when he
                  sought an interview with Marie and was admitted to her presence, and most
                  enthusiastically received by the French woman, who intended to send for him on the
                  same evening, being the result of a promise she had made to Lucy's mother; for
                  seeing Mrs. Carmine constantly grieving for her lost child, so affected her that
                  she knelt by Mrs. Carmine's bed and swore, by all the worlds above, that she would
                  rescue her daughter from captivity; but how, and in what manner to set about it,
                  she did not then exactly know; so she determined to consult Walsh as to the best
                  manner to proceed. They held repeated conversations upon the subject, and
                  ultimately formed a plan, and prepared to put it into effect, as will be seen in
                  our coming pages.</p>
               <p>Marie was of a volatile disposition, and at times—as Walsh frequently observed
                  with a leering smile—troubled with touches of the "keroics."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mons. Walsh," she would exclaim, while her eyes were lit with sparkling
                  flashes of enthusiasm, "you shall come with me to my beautiful home in the
                  mountains; you shall witness with what affectionate ardor my polite husband shall
                  receive me. He will invite you to his sumptuous table and display his<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000029"/> service of silver and gold; you shall eat your
                  venison with his golden arrow-head and pick your handsome teeth with the point of
                  his scalping knife."</p>
               <p>And then the actress would dance around the room, giving vent to many a derisive
                  laugh, imitating, to a very dot, the positions, and attitudes, and slow-motioned
                  swings of the squaws in the spring war-dance of the fishes.</p>
               <p>The interpreter began to look upon Marie as a kind of article in which he held
                  great interest. Had he not been the cause of rescuing her from a brutal husband; a
                  herd of ruthless savages? True, he had been imposed upon, and it was the result of
                  a mistake, yet he had a certain indefinable interest in the woman, and he resolved
                  to let her know it at some future day and claim her as his wife. Her proposal for
                  him to accompany her to the Indian village and recover Lucy Carmine, and demand of
                  Powderhorn the fulfillment of his contract—to give up the girl or refund the
                  money—he did not object to, but he wanted time for reflection, to consider the
                  best means to accomplish his object. Marie was impulsively pressing. There would
                  be time enough to discuss the matter on the way.</p>
               <p>"Only let us start, and then you and my amiable husband can arrange matters so
                  nicely, so softly, that my Powderhorn will give you the nice young lady, and Mons.
                  Carmine will give us money enough to make us both rich for life, and then we can
                  visit La Belle France, and see my mother"—and Marie, at times, would shed tears
                  when speaking of her youthful home and aged parents.</p>
               <p>It was not so much the trader's money or the recovering of the girl which was
                  gradually urging Walsh to consent to his immediate departure for the village. It
                  was to save Deerheel's life—for he knew well when the story of his treachery
                  should be told at the Fort, by Wacco, when he returned, that—if not killed by the
                  scout's friend—he would fall a victim to the revenge of some one of the scout's
                  companions, and they were numerous and generally, revengeful.</p>
               <p>The Colonel had not been idle. He had sent several friendly Indians to Hosamarea,
                  offering horses, beeves, and ammunition in exchange for the girl, but they failed
                  to bring any positive answer that Miss Carmine would be set at liberty. At times
                  he resolved to attack the village, but his better sense prevailed when he
                  considered the small force at command, and the great number of warriors that could
                  be brought to oppose him. Nor was the trader wanting in zeal in devising plans to
                  achieve the freedom of his daughter; but he saw no other way than to once more
                  employ Walsh's services in the hazardous undertaking, and thus the interpreter was
                  pressed from all quarters to redeem his character as a successful negotiator, and
                  a man capable of vindicating his honor from any taint of cowardice or
                  treachery.</p>
               <p>And so we leave the garrison, Marie and the interpreter, and refer back to the
                  capture of Deerheel—Hosamarea's prisoner.</p>
               <p>Along the winding canyon's mountainous path the Indians led the prisoner's horse,
                  while the long single-file of horsemen were moving towards their home amid the
                  steep pointed rocks. They were cheered by thoughts of the happy greeting with
                  which they would be received by their squaws and the village braves, and the good
                  cheer that would be ready waiting to refresh their hungry bodies. How different
                  were the feelings of the scout: Sore distress oppressed him; he cared little for
                  the smarting of his limbs, little for the galling pressure of the rawhide thongs,
                  and his aching arms—which were securely tied behind his back. He was well aware
                  that no mercy would be shown him if Powderhorn could have his say and; and
                  although the Comanche chief was known to be merciful to his prisoners, yet the
                  traitor would certainly strive to prevail upon the chief to surrender him into his
                  power that he might deal with him in a manner as best suited his purpose He
                  shuddered to think that he would be so near the trader's daughter, and yet be
                  without the power to assist her; and probably she would be forced to witness his
                  ignominious death. He strove to banish the thought of this double captivity, until
                  his very soul sickened within him. The morning star had just arisen in the east,
                  and the owl was warning its young brood of the approaching day, when the village
                  was entered, and he was taken from his horse, carried into the chief's tent and
                  permitted to rest his wearied limbs in a sitting position. Sleep he could not, for
                  the agony of his mind, the torturing consciousness of his powerless, hopeless,
                  condition nearly drove his spirit to<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5694-00000030"/>
                  madness. The prevailing quietude of the village—save the distant bark of the
                  mountain wolf, winding the coming morn—rendered his soul miserable; a tortured
                  existence, more dreadful than any fears of death; more agonizing than any
                  prospects of punishment beyond the grave. He was lying in an almost insensible
                  condition long after the appearance of the sun, and, when aroused by a furious
                  shaking, Hosamarea stood before him. The chief in silence unloosed his thongs and
                  bade him stand erect. The prisoner made several attempts, when finding his legs
                  too galled and sore, he fell back into his same sitting position.</p>
               <p>"Be brave chief; great brave; Comanche man! so me be good to you. No be so! me no
                  be good to you," said Hosamarea, making use of what little English he had picked
                  up from the traders and his prisoners.</p>
               <p>"I am sick," replied the scout in Spanish; "I shall be a man wherever I am found,
                  and in whatever condition. I am fit for nothing now."</p>
               <p>"Powderhorn wants you; buy you: me no sell you—be my man; work, shoot, hunt for
                  Hosamarea;" spoke the chief. "Medicine man come see you; I go, squaw bring meat
                  and bread."</p>
               <p>Saying which he left him, much to the relief of the scout, and much to his
                  satisfaction had Deerheel heard his refusal to sell him to Powderhorn, and now
                  hopes began already to swell within his breast—for both he and Lucy might yet be
                  free, and he felt assured that if she could not be united to him in marriage, she
                  would not pledge her love to another. An Indian boy, carrying a tin plate with a
                  pint cup full of water, made his appearance. The plate contained some mule meat,
                  very salty, and mesquite bean bread. The boy set the food and water before him
                  upon the ground, and after motioning him to eat, left the tent.</p>
               <p>In the evening, Hosamarea entered the tent, and seating himself upon the bottom of
                  an upturned basket, handed the prisoner his pipe to smoke, from which—not thinking
                  it policy to refuse—he took several whiffs, and then returned it to the chief, who
                  resumed his smoking and spoke as follows:</p>
               <p>"We are at war with your people; we have slain them in battle; we have taken from
                  them their mules, oxen, and horses, and their wives and children we have led into
                  our homes as prisoners." Hosamarea spoke in the Spanish language. "We are a great
                  people, and, like the forest leaves, we extend over all the mountains to the great
                  sea south; those who war against us are destined to destruction; the Great Spirit
                  made us the first on earth, and we are to be the last race to hunt the buffalo;
                  the best and bravest of other people whom we conquer we take into our nation—as a
                  large stream receives a small one—and thus we have determined to spare your
                  life—and you may decide whether you will become a great brave among us or live a
                  slave to some of my squaws, and wear the shackles of bondage. You can never
                  escape; before the full moon you must decide."</p>
               <p>"What are your terms?" asked the scout, "and what is to be my treatment?"</p>
               <p>"When the council meet, a test will be afforded you. If you are sincere, you will
                  do as they bid you; if not, you become forever a slave—a man-squaw, to cook, to
                  wash, to clean horses and to pound the beans to make bread."</p>
               <p>"Then you never kill your prisoners?" asked Deerheel.</p>
               <p>"Unless," replied the chief, "they attempt to escape."</p>
               <p>"And you serve the women the same way?" again asked the scout.</p>
               <p>"No; they are water in our hands; they are as weak as a blade of grass. We give
                  them in marriage to our young braves or hold them as prizes to be ransomed. They
                  are matters of trade with us—as also our slaves;" and then after a few moments he
                  asked, "How came you on the trail to our camp?"</p>
               <p>"I came," replied the scout, "to learn where the trader's daughter could be found,
                  that I might render her assistance, and buy her back again for the trader."</p>
               <p>"Ugh!" replied Hosamarea, in broken English, "love gal; want to buy gal! Trader,
                  big money; much beef! Powderhorn no like gal—he like much money!"</p>
               <p>The chief now abruptly left him, but returned in a few moments, bringing two
                  Indians with him.</p>
               <p>"These are your keepers until the council meet," he said. "they will point out to
                  you the line through the village where you can go, and no further. If you break
                  this law they will shoot you."</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5694-00000031"/>
               <p>And leaving Deerheel to his fate, we return to Lucy Carmine—Powderhorn's
                  money-chest, as he styled her. Traitor, miscreant that he was; desperado in the
                  widest and wildest sense of the term; an existence standing isolated in the world;
                  no man's friend; hopeless of ever returning to, or being endured by civilization;
                  surrounded by those who filled him with disgust—not of their nation, their creed
                  nor their habits of life—he stood living embodiment of <choice>
                     <sic>hypocracy</sic>
                     <corr>hypocrisy</corr>
                  </choice>, criminality and moral degradation in its most hideous form: fallen as
                  he was, defiled, debased and indifferent to the misery of another's woe—this man
                  of vicious instincts was mastered by one passion—and that passion, the love of
                  gold, the avaricious thirst for money. For this alone he had disowned his
                  religion, caste and nation, and become a naturalized chief of the enemies of his
                  own people. To gratify this insatiate lust for money, he betrayed his employer and
                  stole from him his only child in order to further rob him of his gold. No doubt
                  there are many men among us who under like <choice>
                     <sic>temptatations</sic>
                     <corr>temptations</corr>
                  </choice> and possessing similar instincts, would have played an equally infamous
                  part, had occasion offered or circumstances permitted. If he ever loved, it was an
                  only sister, who died in her sixteenth year, and who drew her last breath in the
                  house of Carmine, who had proved his friend in adversity. When once mounted upon
                  his horse, holding Lucy firmly within the clasp of his powerful arms, he guided
                  his active war-steed with masterly hand, in his hurried retreat—avoiding all
                  places where he was likely to stumble or balk nor did he draw a halting rein until
                  he well knew that his swift gait had placed him beyond the reach of capture or
                  even pursuit. By a circuitous route he reached a mountain spring; here his horses
                  slackened his speed when he beckoned to his two attendant Indian horsemen, and
                  upon their alighting and coming to him, he with great care handed the insensible
                  form of the lovely girl into their arms, when they sat her upon the ground, near
                  the sparkling waters of the chrystal spring. By a pathway scarcely visible to even
                  a practiced eye, he had reached this hidden hunter's treasure and retreat, and
                  from this point upon the mountain's rocky granite side, a most extensive and
                  enchanting view opened to the eyes of the beholder. The longer, winding stream of
                  the Brazos river could be traced by the dense growth of lofty trees, and varied
                  breaks in the scenery by projecting points of the mountain spurs, which presented
                  bold fronts of polished boulder rocks, with here and there broken fragments
                  hanging over perpendicular cliffs where oft the native savage had beheld, with
                  awe-struck soul, the gathering storms of summer, or the dark advance athwart the
                  winter sky, the furious masses of the frozen clouds from the distant North. It was
                  at this refreshing spring, the water of which, when sprinkled on her face by
                  Powderhorn Joe, restored her to consciousness—that she became aware of the full
                  extent of her misfortune—a prisoner, a captive, in the hands of the ruthless
                  savage, of which she had read with so much childish horror in her earlier days of
                  girlhood.</p>
               <p>As we have stated upon a previous occasion, the traitor left nothing to chance. To
                  this point, he had determined to carry his victim, in case he was successful in
                  securing her body, and he had made preparations accordingly. He walked up the
                  mountain's winding path until he reached a ledge of huge boulder rocks, behind
                  which a Mexican boy was seen holding two horses—one a small Indian pony, the other
                  a broad-backed American horse. To take a lady's side-saddle from a cluster of
                  bushes near the rocks was but the work of a few moments, and then having securely
                  girthed it upon the horse, he led it back to the spring, and seating the almost
                  unconscious girl upon it, he bade the Mexican ride in front upon his pony, and to
                  head it up the path, across an adjacent break in the mountain. Lucy, in a
                  half-conscious and almost bewildered state of mind, held on with an almost
                  nerveless grasp, and barely kept her seat; but Powderhorn rode so close in her
                  rear as to be ready to afford assistance in case she was likely to meet with any
                  accident to her person. or of any stumbling on the part of the animal upon which
                  she sat. After one more resting spell, they reached the village early on the
                  coming morn, when her stiffened limbs were lifted from the saddle, and she was
                  placed in a comfortable tent, and delivered into the keeping of two aged Mexican
                  women. Night—so beautiful to the youthful lover, especially when the stars glow
                  brightly resplendent above in the vast canopy of the heavens; so soothing in its
                  influence upon the wearied spirit of the laborer;<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000032"/> so assuring to the daring mariner upon the
                  undulating surface of the great ocean of waters; and so beguiling to the steadfast
                  watchers of our homes—had no balm for Lucy: her soul had almost ceased to harbor
                  an existence, and the very nerves of her body refused to respond to the ordinary
                  sensations of animation, mental or bodily life. She heeded not the sighing of the
                  night wind; heard nothing of the bark of the Indian village dog, and the defiant
                  replying howl of the wolf from his mountain rock; nor the random whoop of the
                  morose owl from his sheltered abode in the forest glens; nor was she conscious to
                  the tread of the Indian guard loitering round her tent—which was made of skins and
                  pine bark. And so simmered away the gloomy hours of night, and so passed away a
                  portion of her existence—lifeless to all intents and purposes, as though her
                  nerves were relaxed by the freezing cramps of death. The day was dawning; far in
                  the distant east the morning's silver sheen could be traced athwart the valley's
                  expanded horizon, and the busy hum of the whole insect tribe had subsided into
                  quiet, and silence reigned supreme below, along the bushy and rocky mountain's
                  base, when Powderhorn, with a tardy movement of his limbs, arose from his buffalo
                  robe, and throwing aside the cotton curtain before his tent door, gazed for a
                  moment at the gathering light in the east, and then again sought his bed, but it
                  was only to think and to plot. The memory of a sister once dear to him, the
                  kindness with which he had been treated by Lucy's parents, all passed rapidly
                  through his mind, but he cast from him all sense of gratitude or mercy, and
                  pressed down into the silent and deep recesses of his heart, with all the solid
                  weight, too, of an iron will, all the startling creations of conscience, and then
                  turning his body with a sluggish movement, he bowed his forehead against his arm,
                  muttering in slow, solemn tones:</p>
               <p>"She's mine; 'tis enough she's preserved from insult and abuse. Carmine has got
                  his money by robbing the government and cheating the Indian; he must part with a
                  portion of his wealth, and there is no other way I can leave this cursed life, and
                  part company with these dogs."</p>
               <p>Thought succeeded thought in turning over the situation in his mind, until finally
                  he left his bed with an undetermined plan of action—resolved to be governed
                  entirely by circumstances, but still firm in one course of action, and that was to
                  make Carmine pay a large ransom for his daughter.</p>
               <p>How different was the waking of Lucy—his captive: When she came to partial
                  consciousness, she was aroused by a great noise, surrounding her upon all sides of
                  the tent, above which arose loud and uncouth shouts, which seemed strange and
                  harsh to her ears, adding confusion to her returning ideas of identity. Her two
                  attendants—the Mexican women, slaves of her captor—were conversing in low tones
                  when her eyes rested upon them. They both spoke to her in the Spanish language,
                  but not understanding their words, she only gazed the more intently and
                  inquiringly at their anxious faces. Presently, one left the tent. whilst the other
                  brought a wet towel and began rubbing her face and smoothing back the long,
                  disheveled ringlets of golden auburn from her fair receding brow. Shortly, the
                  woman returned with a tin cup full of warm tea, and by emotions and earnest
                  gestures insisted upon her drinking the whole cupful. Lucy hesitated for awhile,
                  but they insisting more strenuously than at first, she saw it was useless to
                  longer refuse, and so complied with their request. The women went out and then
                  returned with a tin bucket of bread and dried meat. In a few minutes the virtues
                  of the tea began to be felt in her system and developing her mind and actions all
                  the effects intended to be produced, for she arose to her feet and would have left
                  the tent, had she not been gently prevented by the women, who smiled as they saw
                  the action of the decoction of herbs upon her mind. The tea had been prepared with
                  evident intent to create a sudden and wholesome change in her nerves. The cave
                  moss and root of the lady-slipper or moccasin plant had been mixed by bruizing,
                  and then boiled over a slow fire and set aside until nearly cool, when it was
                  strained the herbs thrown away and the water used as a decoction—and it was of
                  this drink she was made to imbibe. Like the soft music of a dream, pleasurable
                  sensations swelled all the nerves of her body. The canvas of the tent assumed the
                  brilliant glaze of silk, the rings of her fingers reflected an azure and purple
                  luster, the tin cup became a chalice of burnished silver, while the countenances
                  of her attendants became as brazen casts—varying in<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000033"/> expressions—of finished copper and brass. All
                  restraints of timidity fled from her as though banished from the realms of
                  effulgent light and courageous spirits. Fear, she knew not; hatred or anger
                  lingered not in her breast; all was beautiful and lovely to her sight. It was as
                  it were a golden vision, unearthly in its subduing influences, celestial in its
                  circling changes of beauty, and gorgeous in the splendor of coloring. She heard
                  the neighing of numerous steeds before and beyond her prison; the loud shouts of
                  savage exclamations ascending up to the clouds, and she then felt as though
                  inspired with a martial ardor that would have urged her to lead a host to battle.
                  While in this ecstatic state of blissful beatitude, a horseman galloped near the
                  tent, when her attendants drew aside the canvas door and she beheld a thousand
                  horsemen, or more, drawn up in battle array—a solid mass of Indian cavalry—with
                  the heads of the horses decked with ribbons of <choice>
                     <sic>guady</sic>
                     <corr>gaudy</corr>
                  </choice> hue; their riders painted and feathered for the war-path, while from the
                  tips of the mass of burnished lance-heads flashed all the brilliant colors of a
                  summer's rainbow. Never in dream or trance did mortal eye rest upon so grand a
                  martial aspect of war. Not a lance seemed to vary from its even line of direction;
                  scarce a war-horse moved from the position assigned it by Hosamarea—the bravest
                  war chief and the best horseman of his day. Neither women nor children were
                  present to admire or obstruct the evolutions of this solid phalanx of a part of
                  the combined war strength of the Comanche nation. All was silent, threatening to
                  the ordinary beholder, but to Lucy Carmine all was magnificent, picturesque and
                  exciting. Suddenly and swiftly the decorated chief, with lance poised in the air,
                  dashed in front of the line, commanding and ordering by the motions of his
                  spear-head, and then like an unwinding serpent, the line unfolded itself in the
                  form of an S, and as the curtain fell and shut out the wild and superbly bold and
                  enchanting review, the trader's daughter sank into a profound sleep and was borne
                  to her bed of buffalo-skins, and thus exhausted nature subsided into the gentle
                  peace of a repose as continued as it was required and beneficial.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IF we have lost sight for a time of one of the most important
                  characters in this narrative, it is owing to the pressure upon our attention of
                  more serious events, but the trusty friend of the scout, Deerheel, was ever on the
                  watch. Night and day found him faithful in his vigilance to aid his captive
                  companion. It was about a half moon after Deerheel's capture when the god of day
                  rolled up from the ocean of space—round, fiery and red—that Wacco, while yet the
                  dew was fresh upon grass and shrub, descended from a ravine with his rifle upon
                  his shoulder and his hunting-knife hanging loosely from his belt. Noiselessly he
                  stepped along, his light moccasins damped by the moist rocks and herbage beneath
                  his feet. Now a coming to a large log, which time had robbed of its bark, he
                  carefully surveyed its length and thickness then carefully and securely placing
                  his left foot upon it, he quietly lifted his body and then stood erect, examining
                  with a scrutinizing eye all surrounding objects, and particularly marking the spot
                  upon which he was to place his foot on the opposite side. This peculiarity of
                  never stepping over a log we have frequently observed, and they have told us, and
                  others too, that it was the fear of treading upon a snake very wise precaution, as
                  any one will admit who has ever hunted in the wilds of Texas. Upon turning his
                  gaze toward the mountain his attention seemed attracted, through the dim haze of
                     the<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5694-00000034"/> early sunlight, to a wounded and
                  wearied doe, which was slowly descending by a narrow trail; and then at intervals,
                  through breaks in the rocks, the gray form of a wild cat was seen bounding from
                  boulder to boulder with sluggish and almost exhausted strength, and next its mate
                  appeared, crawling over the rocks equally spent in wind and speed. The warrior
                  kills not the buffalo calf or the suckling fawn, or the mother with her young. His
                  very nature revolts at this act of thoughtless barbarity, and it is by the strict
                  observance of this wise rule of the chase, that his game is preserved and his
                  winter's food secured to him. By a violent and almost expiring effort the deer
                  bounded, with quick, short jumps, across a deep break in the rocks and then sank
                  upon the ground, an inviting feast to her merciless pursuers. The foremost cat
                  made several vain, attempts to follow, and in doing so, lost its balance and fell
                  into the break. The Indian watched in silence for several moments, and when he saw
                  the head of the cat ascend above the opposite rock, and by slow degrees drag its
                  body up to the secure resting place upon the rock, he gave vent to his customary
                  grunt of satisfaction, the universal and eternal "ugh!" and, raising the
                  gain-twist rifle to his shoulder, he sighted along the barrel, then resting the
                  stock upon the log again, he muttered to himself, as though he thought the
                  distance too far, or that the report of the rifle might betray him, but when he
                  saw the head and tail of the hindmost cat disappear as the first had done, he no
                  longer hesitated; he again raised the rifle, and, taking deliberate aim, touched
                  the feather-trigger. The next instant, the body of the cat bounded into the air,
                  and falling into the break in the rock was seen no more, while the sharp, quick
                  report of the rifle darted from chasm to rock, reverberating along the mountain's
                  side, until its familiar echo was lost in the blue tops of the painted nobs, and
                  then came forth that noted "ugh!" as he again proceeded to charge his gun.
                  Scarcely had he completed his task, when the second cat was seen to protrude its
                  head and follow the same trail as its mate. Again the rifle was brought to his
                  shoulder, the trigger touched, when the eager feline pursuer fell backwards beside
                  the body of its mate, and then came the interminable "ugh!" as he sat himself
                  composedly down upon the log. He seemed perfectly bewildered at his own
                  performances, and his astonishment at the power of the rifle was so great that it
                  almost unnerved him. Fully four hundred yards intervened between him and his
                  victims, and yet death had been dealt out to them by a gun barrel scarcely three
                  feet in length, and the only force used as a driving power being a thimbleful of
                  powder. After three hours of watching his disabled game, he was seen ascending
                  between the projecting rocks to secure the wounded and helpless deer, and here we
                  must leave him until he is seen in the performance of more desperate and daring
                  achievements of valor.</p>
               <p>Colonel M— had solicited an interview with the Comanche chief in regard to the
                  purchase of Miss Lucy Carmine's person, but this, Hosamarea had steadily refused,
                  alleging that it was a matter with which he had nothing to do, and as the Colonel
                  could not seek an interview with the despicable wretch, Powderhorn—and which would
                  as certainly have been refused the task of freeing Lucy was left entirely to the
                  management of her father and his agents.</p>
               <p>Deerheel had been allowed the freedom of the camp within certain limits, but never
                  was permitted to approach that quarter of the village in which Miss Carmine was
                  confined. Powderhorn had never ceased his efforts to buy the scout of <choice>

                     <corr>Hosamarea</corr>
                  </choice>, but that chief had ulterior objects in view, and so great was his
                  interest in the welfare of his people that neither favors, bribes, nor merchandise
                  could make him swerve from a line of policy marked out for the discipline and
                  benefit of his tribe. He was well aware of the superior qualities of the white
                  man; he was influenced by reasons of sound policy—and had always striven to avoid
                  open rupture with the forces at the Fort. <choice>

                     <corr>Predatory</corr>
                  </choice> excursions he could not well prevent, and when he discovered that the
                  martial ardor of his people could no longer be restrained, he led them in person,
                  but always with the object of strengthening his power over the young braves.
                  Powderhorn, during his absence, had planned the attack upon the train, and though,
                  as the head chief he had himself afterward sanctioned it, still the fight had been
                  attended by the loss of some of his most promising young braves, and the only one
                  who reaped any large profit from the fight was the naturalized chief; Powderhorn.
                  By bribery and<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5694-00000035"/> management Hosamarea had
                  obtained possession of the scout, and this was, in part, an offset to the other's
                  capture of Lucy. Still he could not but infer that Powderhorn aimed at greater
                  influence over the tribe, and for this reason resolved to enforce, strictly, the
                  laws in regard to captives taken by surprise or in battle. A chance then was to be
                  offered to Deerheel to become one of his own people, and if this could be done it
                  would prove a great accession to his own people, for this policy of gathering
                  strength from an enemy was his motive for sparing many a captive's life. One full
                  moon had elapsed since Deerheel's imprisonment, and the council was to meet on the
                  following moon, and then the scout would be sworn into his band of braves, and
                  become one of his own people. The council could impose certain rigorous forms of
                  admission, but if insisted upon by three chiefs, then tests of the severest
                  character were to be enforced, but the prisoner could not be killed, but became a
                  slave for life, and received such punishment as the three insisting chiefs should
                  determined to inflict. Powderhorn had obtained the chief's permission to visit
                  Deerheel in his tent, and accordingly he sought the prisoner one night while yet
                  his evening meal was unfinished. Deerheel was sitting upon a log before his tent,
                  when the obnoxious traitor approached, saying:</p>
               <p>"So the buck would follow the doe to the very door of the hunter's hut? and you,
                  Crampton, are in the most miserable fix of any poor devil in this State."</p>
               <p>"I never was your enemy, and never did you harm," replied the prisoner. "Cease to
                  upbraid me. Let me finish ny meal in peace."</p>
               <p>"You tried to spoil my little game, and that wrongfully and most contemptibly.
                  Look here, Crampton," he excitedly continued, "did not old Carmine spurn you from
                  him like a dog? Has he ever even recognized you as a white man, much less as a
                  suitor for his daughter's hand? And you skulking, lick-spittle cur, you still
                  crave his forgiveness in hopes of obtaining his daughter's hand in marriage. You
                  want his money, and would <choice>

                     <corr>cringe</corr>
                  </choice> to fawning like a dog to win her, and yet, I, like a bold Comanche
                  brave, fought for her and won the prize. But I want his money, too, and not his
                  sickly, sentimental gal; a gentle enough dove, no doubt, but one whose cooing
                  finds no answer in my heart. I like better the ring of the pure metal. Have you
                  nothing to say?" he continued as the scout turned his face from the speaker. "As
                  you are a white man as well as myself, I wish to get you out of a little fix
                  you'll be in when the council meets for you are so placed you can not spoil my
                  little trick on Carmine. Now listen: they will force you to swear by the sun, and
                  make you consent to be shot in case you attempt to escape; but should it be
                  insisted upon that the full trial be complied with, you will be put to the test of
                  your sincerity and be compelled to shoot one of your own race and color before the
                  council. This done, and you become one of us."</p>
               <p>"And if I refuse?" asked the scout.</p>
               <p>"Then a slave, a dog, and chastised for cowardice, to be kicked from tent to tent,
                  and scalded by the squaws when angry. Now, my advice is for you to refuse to spill
                  the blood of your own race, let the consequences be what they may. Be guided by
                  me—as I am not your enemy—you having done me no wrong."</p>
               <p>"And did you do it?" asked the scout.</p>
               <p>"No," he said, "never yet; I became a brave by warring with other tribes. So now,
                  all night to you, but remember the advice of one of your own people."</p>
               <p>"I thank you," replied Deerheel; "I will consider about it."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>AS Hosamarea had prepared him somewhat as to the test that would be
                  required, and had told him of Powderhorn's desire to purchase him of the chief,
                  and as the traitor could possibly have no grudge against him, might it not have
                  been for the object of freeing him from his imprisonment that Powderhorn wanted to
                  purchase him? At least so it seemed after reflecting upon the matter, and he
                  resolved to follow his advice. Many an anxious day passed until the new moon was
                  visible. At last it made its appearance with horns down, and he was summoned
                  before the council at noon next day. There were three other white prisoners, and
                  they were marched in single-file before the council of old chiefs and young
                  braves, who sat in a solid circle around the sacred stone, of circular cut, smooth
                  surface, and one foot in thickness. Three persons could stand upon it with ease,
                  but no one was permitted to sit thereon. Hosamarea, with the medicine man and
                  prophet, almost entirely naked, were standing erect when the prisoners were
                  brought to a halt, when the nature of the trial and examination were explained to
                  them in Spanish.</p>
               <p>And here was witnessed the infliction of a most severe penalty for a social
                  infraction of the Indian law. The body of a stout young Indian was tied to four
                  pegs driven into the ground, to each of which his legs and arms were fastened with
                  raw-hide. Three Indians with stout hickory switches stood on either side, who, at
                  a given signal, alternately applied the birch with a vim and vigor until the
                  number of blows required by the sentence had been struck upon his back, contained
                  in the decision of the council. The sufferer, when released, could scarcely stand,
                  and was led to his tent by several of the old squaws, who were the only
                  spectators, and who, seemingly, sympathized with the criminal.</p>
               <p>It appears the offence committed was marrying one of his blood kin, which is not
                  tolerated by the Indians, even within the most distant ties of consanguinity. The
                  first offence, and the young or old brave is notified to quit living with his
                  squaw, and if this admonition is not respected, then a whipping follows; the
                  second offence being the loss of an ear, the third perpetration of the crime is
                  the loss of the other ear, and the fourth refusal to put away his squaw is death.
                  It is to the strict enforcement of this prohibitory law that the Comanche Indians
                  owe their fine symmetry of person, muscular development, and freedom from
                  hereditary diseases so prevalent in other nations where first and second blood
                  cousins are permitted to intermarry.</p>
               <p>What religious rite had been performed previous to the arrival of the scout he was
                  unable to determine.</p>
               <p>But that which was required of him in substance was as stated by the chief and the
                  traitor. The first two white men were questioned, took the oath, and with a knife
                  presented to them, opened a vein in their arms and let the blood fall upon the
                  ground. This, and some other formalities, satisfied the chiefs, and they then
                  passed out of the circle, yet still under guard. No one had spoken during the
                  performance of the ceremony, but when Deerheel was led immediately in front of the
                  trio—the head authorities of the nation—a hum arose from the dense circle of
                  council members. At this moment three braves—one of whom, by his conspicuously
                  tall, robust figure, was recognized as Powderhorn—and they separately and
                  distinctly demanded the death test. Hosamarea seemed excited and angry, but
                  quickly explained the test trial, and asked if he was willing, and before the
                  scout could reply, exclaimed in a loud voice: "Prisoner consents to undergo the
                  ordeal." Powderhorn, greatly excited, endeavored to speak, but was promptly
                  silenced by one<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5694-00000037"/> of the guard leveling his
                  gun at him. A young man—one of the cripples—was instantly brought out and placed
                  without the circle, when the scout was pushed back several yards, and a cocked
                  rifle placed in his trembling hands. In obedience to orders, he took aim at the
                  human form opposite to him, then dropping the gun, he wheeled quickly round and
                  confronted his judges. A loud and prolonged hissing followed. The chief now
                  pronounced the sentence upon him, which was to ever remain a slave for life, and
                  for his cowardice to receive such punishment as should be meted out to him by the
                  three braves.</p>
               <p>The council now broke up until the decision of the three braves should agree as to
                  the kind of punishment. An hour after this the council again assembled, and
                  Hosamarea stated that it was to tie the prisoner upon the back of a bucking mule,
                  face downward, with the head toward the tail.</p>
               <p>Quick as thought the scout was seized, a mule selected for the instrument of
                  fulfilling law, when with the utmost celerity he was tied as the sentence was
                  repeatedly spoken, and then the mule turned loose. At last the animal refused to
                  stir, but stood upon its dignity, firmly planting its four feet to the ground, and
                  refusing to budge, or even move its ears or tail, until finally, driven from its
                  obstinate humor, it squatted, neighed, and began sundry tricks of getting rid of
                  so extraordinary a burden. Up went its heels, down went its head between its
                  fore-legs. Snorting, blowing and kicking, it trotted round in a circle as though
                  annoyed beyond endurance, and then came another immovable, obstinate spell of
                  stubbornness. But the spear and arrow-heads again disturbed its equanimity of
                  temper, so starting off, it took a wider circle in its gymnastic performances,
                  much to the enthusiastic delight of the spectators, and much to the discomfort and
                  misery of the unfortunate scout lashed to its rump. The sport was most
                  unexpectedly to be rendered more exciting than it was extraordinary. For amid the
                  shouts and laughter of the crowd, the mule darted off at a swift gallop, taking a
                  path leading up the mountain toward the plain, and before any suspicion of its
                  real intent could be ascertained, it had placed several hundred yards between its
                  tantalizers and the captive, and was seen still trotting up the craggy and dubious
                  path, almost to the very summit of the mountain. The Indians stood as though
                  paralyzed with wonder. Finally, Hosamarea, after a short delay, ordered some of
                  the mounted guard to follow and bring the mule and its tortured human burden back
                  to camp. Some twenty horsemen joined in the pursuit, but the mule, suspecting, as
                  it were, that it would be followed, turned down a deep and dangerous ravine, and
                  became for several moments lost to view. Had they been there they would have seen
                  the Indian Wacco spring from beneath one of the ledge-rocks, grasp the mule
                  tightly by the windpipe and instantly check its progress, land with equal
                  dexterity sever the cords with his hunting knife which bound the limbs and body of
                  the scout to the now motionless hybrid. Then throwing the body of Deerheel over
                  his shoulder, he hurried down the ravine until he came to a patch of shrubbery. He
                  now struck a sidling course along the mountain's rugged side, and with all the
                  strength of which he was master, carried his friend several hundred yards, and
                  then hid him under a projecting rock. Taking his flask he forced water between his
                  friend's lips, and greatly rejoiced to see the scout drink it. A few moments more
                  and Deerheel stood erect upon his feet. After stretching his limbs, and emptying
                  the flask of its contents, and rubbing the muscles which had been most paralyzed
                  by the rawhide lariat, they slowly and cautiously followed along the mountain base
                  until they struck a widening path when they both broke into a running gait and
                  rapidly disappeared from view, the dismounted Indians following in distant but
                  swift pursuit.</p>
               <p>When the mule was seen to have lost its burden, suspicion was immediately
                  awakened, and while some of the pursuers returned to camp to give the alarm and
                  order many of the braves to surround the base of the mountain, the others followed
                  upon the trail of Wacco and the scout. And so rapidly did they mount and so
                  swiftly did they surround the base of the mountain down which the fugitives were
                  hastening that Wacco advised a halt till night; but the pursuers drawing near, the
                  scout deemed it best for them to separate, which they did—Wacco hiding among the
                  rocks, while Deerheel slowly followed the path leading to the plain below. When at
                  the bottom of the hill he struck boldly through the chaparral, following what
                  appeared to him a very<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5694-00000038"/> old bear trail,
                  when, turning abruptly around a pile of displaced rock, he drew up face to face
                  with five Indians in single-file. They were on foot—their weapons being lances.
                  Quick as well could be imagined, the foremost warrior cast his lance at him,
                  inflicting a slight wound in the left hand, but the scout, rushing at the foremost
                  one in a stooping position, he placed his head between the brave's legs, and
                  gathering all his strength, hurled him head-foremost into the chaparral. The
                  second, third and forth shared the same fate, but the fifth, dreading the
                  encounter, turned to fly, when the scout, seizing the lance of a prostrate Indian,
                  hurled it with such force into his back as to completely drive it through his
                  body, and then gathering two other lances, he sent one through the side of another
                  as he was emerging from his fallen posture in the brush; the other scampered off
                  as best he could, but the first who received his onset remained motionless, and he
                  drove the lance-head through his heart. At this moment he observed several
                  horsemen coming toward him, when he trusted to his legs for safety. And now began
                  the race for life in real earnest. A rocky mountain's base was on his left, with a
                  thick chaparral border on his right hand. But he had this advantage: that he was
                  on a path, tortuous, it was true, but still easy of travel, while the horsemen
                  were on rough ground upon the outside edge of the thick mesquite chaparral.
                  Whenever his head became visible they sent their arrows at him, but he looked not
                  behind—on, on he sped, until dusky eve hid his form from view.</p>
               <p>A certain signal of recognition had been agreed upon between Wacco and the scout,
                  and when Deerheel thought his pursuers had given over the chase until morning, he
                  gave several quick, sharp barks, imitating, as near as possible, the yelping howl
                  of the cayotte, or small prairie wolf. Again and again, at intervals, he repealed
                  the signal, and then listened with most intense silence—every other faculty being
                  absorbed in his sense of hearing. Not receiving any return signal, and fearing
                  that his companion had discovered a lurking foe, who was equally conversant with
                  similar tricks to deceive their enemies, he moved quietly along the path, and then
                  again halting, repeated the given signal, when, to his joyous surprise, the whoop
                  of the owl seemed to burden the night air, and fill all surrounding space with its
                  echo; and it was heard no more for many minutes. The voice of the night-bird of
                  prey was in truth not uttered with a loud volume of sound, but so entirely was his
                  hearing rendered acute by his great anxiety of mind to welcome it, that he had
                  thought, nor soul, for any other moving or living sound. Again the hunter sent
                  forth the yelp of the cayotte, when nearer drew the round, swelling whoop of the
                  owl. At last, by softer signals they approached each other; then came stealthy
                  chirpings of the quail on the part of Wacco, answered by a low whistle upon the
                  part of the scout. But still dubious that he might be led again into captivity by
                  a cunning and knowing foe, the scout called out:</p>
               <p>"Wacco, Wacco!"</p>
               <p>"Me come, Deerheel," responded the Indian, almost at the feet of his friend.</p>
               <p>The faithful follower had seen the danger of the scout, and had followed in the
                  direction of the chase, and having taken his gun from its hiding place among the
                  rocks, he had placed himself in a position that in case the scout was again taken
                  he intended to shoot his captor, and fight unto death for the recovery of his
                  body, dead or alive.</p>
               <p>Next morning found the scout and his companion many miles from the scene of his
                  captivity, again making their way to the cave in which they had found the she-wolf
                  and her whelps. Their hearts were as dauntless as ever, and their determination as
                  firmly fixed as at the beginning of their tramp to rescue the trader's daughter.
                  But now they were more revengeful and sanguinary in their minds from the wrongs
                  and torments the scout had suffered. Both Wacco and Deerheel sternly resolved to
                  kill Walsh on the first opportunity, be it even within the bounds of the Fort, and
                  in the very presence of the Colonel himself. For Walsh's crime was one which all
                  history condemns—all nations permit its punishment.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IT was on the following morning, while the whole village was in
                  mourning for the loss of the braves whom Deerheel had slain, that the interpreter
                  and Marie, on horseback, were conducted through the village by some of the
                  sentinels of the camp-guard, and brought before Hosamarea's tent.</p>
               <p>The chief was standing with folded arms across his chest, near his tent, and
                  stoically unmoved marked the advance of Walsh and his returned captive.</p>
               <p>If Marie had performed her part of the deaf girl to the admiration of the
                  interpreter on his previous visit to the village, she now renewed it to
                  perfection. For no sooner had her horse been led to the presence of the chief than
                  she, with the most practiced youthful agility alighted from her saddle, and
                  casting herself upon her knees before him, seized his right hand, and began
                  kissing it with fervent ardor; thus signifying the pleasure it gave her to be once
                  more in his presence and under his protection. Forced tears were pressed into
                  service, while every motion of body, every expression of visage, denoted the great
                  gratification her soul experienced in once more beholding her chieftain
                  friend.</p>
               <p>With a pleasant smile, and a kindly hand he lifted her from her kneeling position,
                  and without attempting to reply to her mute and expressive pantomime, passed her
                  into the tent where his squaws stood smiling at the, to them, incomprehensible
                  scene, and then shaking the interpreter warmly by the hand, said in his native
                  tongue:</p>
               <p>"Walsh, you surprise ne, but you bring back counterfeit money. I have sent for
                  your banker, and he will be here directly."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Walsh, rather excited, "and I want to see him. Had he cheated one
                  of the pale-faces, it would have been well, even to twice the sum of money; but
                  one carrying Comanche blood in his veins should have received better
                  treatment."</p>
               <p>"Only half Comanche," replied the chief.</p>
               <p>"No matter if it was only one drop; <choice>
                     <sic>its</sic>
                     <corr>it's</corr>
                  </choice> here, pure and brave." And the interpreter slapped his right hand firmly
                  against his breast, and added: "You may laugh as much, and as long, as you please,
                  Hosamarea, but was it not enough to be swindled out of my money, without being
                  fooled about that dumb-bell, and caused such a deal of trouble?—myself imprisoned
                  for being made to appear a cheat and swindler? But once let me meet Powderhorn,
                  and he shall pay the money back and feed his own mute squaw, for there is no one
                  wanting her at the Fort."</p>
               <p>As was his word, the Comanche chief began laughing at the whole affair to such a
                  degree of mirthfulness as caused tears to run from his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Here he comes," said he pointing to the traitor, who slowly paced along toward
                  the tent.</p>
               <p>"Why is my good friend Hosamarea so indulging his risibles this morning?" spoke
                  Powderhorn. "Ah, Walsh, my good friend, how are you? Give us your honest paw."
                  This he added in English as he offered his capacious hand to the interpreter, who
                  refused the extended civility, and replied:</p>
               <p>"I want none of your courtesy. I want you to return the money you swindled me out
                  of. I want you to return it back, as I have returned your worthless squaw, or one
                  or the other of us has got to gasp for it."</p>
               <p>"As for the money," replied Powderhorn, giving a sly wink at the chief, "<choice>
                     <sic>its</sic>
                     <corr>it's</corr>
                  </choice> circulated pretty freely around the camp, and would be hard to rake into
                  a pile again, besides, it belonged not to you, but to that red-headed master of
                  yours, who stole it from<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5694-00000040"/> the Indians or
                  the government. I know the affairs at Washington and at the Fort as well as you
                  do. When the politicians want to get rid of too pressing a politician, they send
                  him out here—especially one who is troublesome or knows too much—wishing us to
                  take his scalp. Now had the money belonged to you, individually, or any honest
                  fellow like either of us three, it would have been sacred to the touch. But you
                  see it is no crime to steal from a thief. Eh, what think you of my logic?"</p>
               <p>"But it was mine while in my possession," retorted the interpreter. "I was
                  responsible for its keeping and its use; besides, you made a fool of me—got me
                  into the guard-house, and made me the laughing-stock of the <choice>
                     <sic>wole</sic>
                     <corr>whole</corr>
                  </choice> garrison."</p>
               <p>"Pooh! you'll soon get over that. I only intended to send Carmine a mistress—and
                  one who would not talk too much," said Powderhorn.</p>
               <p>"And I return her to you as worthless," said Walsh.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said Powderhorn; "where may the parrot be found?"</p>
               <p>"In the tent. Is it not so, Hosamarea?" asked Walsh.</p>
               <p>"In truth, yes," replied the chief as he again began to laugh at the traitor's
                  confusion.</p>
               <p>"I thought I had got rid of the silent mummy," said the greatly chagrined gambler.
                  "You ought to have kept her while you had her, as an example to other women at the
                  Fort. The officers would have paid you well as an example of discretion for their
                  wives. I want you to take her back again."</p>
               <p>"I say, Powderhorn," spoke the interpreter, "I've stood your villainy, but I'll
                  not stand your sneering abuse. I pronounce you a thief and a liar."</p>
               <p>"What, do you dare insult me in my very camp, you bumpkin?" said the traitor,
                  advancing, with a threatening glance. "Your heart or mine for the buzzards."</p>
               <p>At a motion from Hosamarea to the village guard, who stood near, the two
                  disputants were instantly arrested and carried to separate guard-houses, and there
                  kept until their tempers had time to cool.</p>
               <p>That night there was a meeting held of the town council, and the quarrel
                  discussed, when they decided that as the money belonged longed to an enemy, and
                  white man, it was lawful not only to take but to keep it.</p>
               <p>The discussion was final, and the antagonists were freed and compelled to respect
                  it in full. They were now made to smoke the pipe of peace, and shake hands, and
                  thus end the quarrel.</p>
               <p>"I would not have cared for your return, Walsh," said the traitor after they had
                  been again forced into amicable relations, "if you had only left that silent gal
                  behind you; for the Indians have a kind of veneration for her—a kind of mysterious
                  awe seems to attach itself to you in the minds of these superstitious people, and
                  her being sent back will be attributed by them to something miraculous. The devil
                  take the woman! she must be bewitched or she never could be so mysteriously looked
                  upon by the squaws and young braves. I know she is going to give me trouble, and
                  now that she is out of my possession, no doubt will trump up some trick, and try
                  to be considered a priestess of the tribe. You don't know the tricks and arts of
                  women as I do, or you would not smile at my fears and warning. If the prophet
                  should take it into his head to favor her in any scheme of bettering her
                  condition, he will do so, and make this foolish people believe it."</p>
               <p>"What about Miss Carmine?" asked Walsh.</p>
               <p>"As she ought to be—as any article worth fifty thousand dollars ought to be taken
                  care of. But this time, between us, I want fifty thousand; no mistake."</p>
               <p>"And no swindling, either," added Walsh; "I must see and know my bird this
                  time."</p>
               <p>"Of course, we can arrange that," observed Powderhorn. "If he dare do it,
                  Hosamarea would take her from me and get the money. But he can't; the law is too
                  strict; his life would pay the forfeit. But curse that returned girl. I say,
                  Walsh, though you may treat it lightly, she's going to vex me and I know it."</p>
               <p>"I suppose you managed to have Deerheel shot?" slyly observed Walsh.</p>
               <p>"Shot, indeed! why, man, he is as free as a deer," rejoined the traitor, with an
                  oath, "and sent three braves to the jolly gods above."</p>
               <p>"Escaped?" gasped Walsh, "free, did you say? at large?"</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5694-00000041"/>
               <p>"Aye," rejoined the traitor." "But, man, what ails you? You are as white as a
                  crane, and tremble like a leaf in a storm."</p>
               <p>"It's a bad go, Powderhorn, for any of us—for Carmine— but particularly for
                  myself. He will certainly shoot or cause me to be shot."</p>
               <p>"That's your affair, Walsh; but come to my tent and we'll discuss, further,
                  matters, and try this time to lighten old Carmine's chest just a trifle more—only
                  a trifle more." And Powderhorn almost dragged the unconscious interpreter to his
                  tent, so deeply absorbed was he while reflecting upon the escape of the scout, and
                  its consequences.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>CARMINE gave much of his time to business. He had contracted with
                  the agents of the Government to furnish the Indians with beef and other supplies,
                  and had, with the connivance of the Quartermaster, trafficked with the natives in
                  selling them whisky, arms and ammunition, in contravention of the positive
                  instructions of the Government.</p>
               <p>The result of this unlicensed vending of merchandise was great trouble, both to
                  the officers of the Fort, and also to the Indians.</p>
               <p>The trader had accumulated great wealth, and sought every opportunity of sending
                  it to the States whenever a Government trail was leaving the Fort for
                  supplies.</p>
               <p>Among a certain class of inferior officers and subalterns the capture of his
                  daughter was deemed a punishment, sent direct from Heaven, to avenge the many sins
                  of the trader, and make him suffer in the spirit, if not in the flesh. Carmine was
                  as avaricious as he was unscrupulous in the acquisition of wealth, and even this
                  almost mortal blow, aimed at him by the avenging hand of justice, rendered him
                  none the less unpitying, none the less eager, and none the less active in adding
                  to his vast accumulations of money. Mrs. Carmine was most deeply affected by their
                  loss, and sought consolation, not only in tears—generally the last refuge of woman
                  in the hour of sorrow or<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5694-00000042"/> trouble—but she
                  sought it by humbling her spirit, and asking the sustaining power of Providence.
                  The wealth of the world, the gloss of gold, and the sympathy of friends were
                  naught to her. Her first and last born—her only child—had been torn from her by
                  the ruthless grasp of the savage, and was held a captive in their hands, perhaps
                  never to be restored to her in this world.</p>
               <p>Small and trifling incidents often disturb great minds and defeat great
                  undertakings. And so, in a moderate sense, was Carmine to be acted upon.</p>
               <p>Three days after the departure of Walsh and Marie the trader left the Fort for an
                  evening's stroll around the outer line of the sentinels' posts, and was calmly
                  smoking his cigar, and speculating in his mind upon the success or failure of
                  Marie's embassy to the Comanche chief, for bargaining or treating for his child's <choice>
                     <sic>deliverence</sic>
                     <corr>deliverance</corr>
                  </choice> from imprisonment. He sat himself down upon a log and remained a long
                  time in deep perplexity and worrying of soul, until the moonlight began to reflect
                  the shadows of the trees along the road, and the shade of the bushes near his
                  resting place grew darker and less distinct. Suddenly, as he carelessly gazed in
                  the direction of the chaparral, a form, well known to him, seemed to grow out of
                  the earth, with visage pale and lean, and a bandage closely pressed around the
                  head full down upon the forehead, and then noiselessly and rapidly it disappeared
                  as mysteriously as it had displayed itself. A cold thrill of fear passed through
                  the trader's heart. His very legs refused to lift his body from the log, and a
                  dizziness rapidly shaded his sight. These weaknesses were only momentary, however,
                  for he gradually recovered his natural senses, and then hurriedly left for the
                  Fort.</p>
               <p>Upon his arrival within his wife's room she immediately detected his perturbation
                  of spirit, and quickly asked if he had heard evil news from the village. And upon
                  his assuring her that he had heard nothing, said:</p>
               <p>"Then you are ill, my husband; better send for the surgeon."</p>
               <p>"Wife," replied Carmine, "one minute, until I compose myself." And after a spell
                  of silence he resumed:</p>
               <p>"Wife, as sure as I live—as truly as I exist—I have seen Crampton's ghost."</p>
               <p>"Impossible!" exclaimed the wife, "you have been imposed on, or are deceiving
                  yourself. It is sheer nonsense; you have fallen asleep and have been
                  dreaming."</p>
               <p>"I knew," he said as he wiped the sweat from his moistened forehead, "I knew you
                  would laugh at me, but I tell you—nay, swear to you I saw Crampton's ghost." And
                  then he explained to her all he had seen.</p>
               <p>Still Mrs. Carmine was incredulous, and rallied him upon the folly of believing in
                  such absurd nonsense. But the trader was dumb and immovable to all her entreaties
                  or ridicule, alerting in the most determined and positive manner that he had seen
                  Crampton's ghost.</p>
               <p>The trader sat musing in silent reverie beside the bed of his sick wife, who still
                  remained an invalid. The sentinels had assumed their dreary tramp upon guard at
                  the outposts, and the lanterns in the guard-house were sending forth from the door
                  a pale flush of reddish glare, when the sentinel at road or main entrance to the
                  Fort was accosted by the familiar name of "Mac," and in so low a tone as scarcely
                  to be audible even to his acute faculties of hearing.</p>
               <p>"Who goes there? Halt, and give the countersign!" came the quick, decisive
                  challenge.</p>
               <p>"A friend—-the scout, Deerheel," came the unhesitating response.</p>
               <p>"In God's name," stammered the sentinel, while his very teeth chattered with fear,
                  and his knees grew weak—almost refusing support to his nearly paralyzed body—as
                  his broken sentences of "Halt! I say—halt; on your life, halt, or you're a dead
                  man," came quick and sharp upon the night air.</p>
               <p>"Would you shoot a friend? I say, I am Deerheel."</p>
               <p>"Well, if you be the scout, where is Wacco?" asked Mac.</p>
               <p>"Mae be here—no dead—no Comanche kill dead," replied a voice through the feeble
                  moonlight, "Wacco, Wacco."</p>
               <p>"Then advance," replied the partially assured sentinel leveling his musket at the
                  two forms that were approaching.</p>
               <p>"You should have challenged, then halted us, and called the officer of the guard,"
                  said Deerheel, as he and his friend drew near the soldier, who yet was laboring
                  under the excitement of<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5694-00000043"/> doubt and
                  suspicion. However, the scout soon grasped his hand, and in this was imitated by
                  the Indian Wacco.</p>
               <p>"Mac," said Deerheel, "you know I have full and free entrance at all hours to the
                  Fort."</p>
               <p>"I knew it," replied the soldier, "and that is why I did not call the sergeant of
                  the guard."</p>
               <p>But Deerheel doubted, in his mind, the truthfulness of the statement. However, he
                  did not question the man's motives for his neglect of duty, and so added:</p>
               <p>"I am going privately to the Colonel's rooms. Be silent—mum's the word; friends
                  must not blow on each other; so here we go. Good night—until to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Amen," ejaculated the sentinel, while Deerheel and Wacco stealthily glided around
                  the buildings until they reached the back entrance to the Colonel's quarters,
                  when, looking through the window, they saw the Colonel sitting alone reading a
                  paper by the dim light of a candle.</p>
               <p>The scout gave his well known private rap, when the Colonel let fall the paper and
                  started to his feet, placing his body in a listening attitude of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Come in," he slowly called, when the door opened, and Deerheel, followed by his
                  shadow, Wacco, hastened toward him with extended hand.</p>
               <p>"Good God, Crampton! You here?" exclaimed the officer, as a thrill of intense
                  surprise passed through his frame.</p>
               <p>"Yes, me too," said Wacco. "No dead gone—no kill—no Comanche."</p>
               <p>"It is indeed my trusty scouts," said Colonel M— as he grasped both their hands,
                  and tears of manly, rejoicing feelings gathered in his eyes. "Not dead—not dead!
                  This is too good news. My brave Crampton, this is good fortune; my heart does
                  rejoice in finding you living and restored to us. But you are badly wounded. Let
                  men call the surgeon to have that ugly bandage removed from your head and
                  brow."</p>
               <p>"No, Colonel, do no such thing, as you would befriend and please me," solemnly
                  replied the scout. "Draw the curtains across the windows. I do not wish to be
                  seen. I do not wish any one to know of my arrival. I have stolen in here to
                  consult with you about the rescue of Miss Carmine by treaty, and I want you to
                  promise me your silence. It will further my designs, and greatly assist me in the
                  old affair of which I once spoke to you."</p>
               <p>"I will serve you in every way, Crampton," replied the Colonel, as he drew the
                  curtains across the windows, excluding all sight from without. The Colonel then
                  spoke:</p>
               <p>"I will promise you all in my power to perform, within the scope of my official
                  duties, save and except one thing, Crampton: never to pardon Walsh."</p>
               <p>"I will not dispute with you on that score; but both Wacco and myself have
                  something to pay—and that with interest," rejoined the scout.</p>
               <p>"Do you know, Crampton," resumed the officer with great animation, "he reported
                  that he saw you both taken and shot and got a number of Indians to confirm his
                  statement?"</p>
               <p>"Not quite so bad as that," rejoined the scout. "Now sit quiet, Colonel, and I
                  will relate to you the whole of my adventure since my departure."</p>
               <p>"On condition," said the Colonel, "that you join me in a glass of grog, and a
                  snack of cold venison."</p>
               <p>"Me eat em heap; me likey whisky—me no takey much—no good head," interposed
                  Wacco.</p>
               <p>Upon assenting to this proposal, the Colonel went out, gave his orders, and then
                  returned to the room.</p>
               <p>"Now, my dear fellow, luncheon will soon be served, and after you have finished
                  your no doubt interesting story, I will briefly state to you all that has occurred
                  with us since your departure."</p>
               <p>To all of which Wacco replied:</p>
               <p>"Walsh no good Indian, no good white man; no all Indian no all white man, no all
                  deer, no all buffalo; some deer, some buffalo."</p>
               <p>"He means, Colonel," said the scout, "that Walsh is a half-breed. You see what
                  efforts at illustrations he makes to explain himself?"</p>
               <p>"I guessed his meaning. But now for your desperate adventure in the
                  mountains."</p>
               <p>And so, gentle reader, we leave them, and beg your attention<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000044"/> in another direction, and request your indulgence
                  if we present those two arrant knaves, the interpreter and the traitor, to the
                  presence of your, no doubt, discerning mind.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IT was a week after we saw them conversing in the tent, that they
                  now appear before you. They are sitting upon a large, flat rock conversing. The
                  young girls and boys were playing ball upon the outskirts of the village near
                  them. The traitor was smoking a clay pipe, and with one leg crossed over his knee,
                  was looking the interpreter full in his face, while he spoke:</p>
               <p>"Between us, Walsh," said he, "there should remain a friendly understanding. It's
                  true, I played you a little legerdemain work but as I will make it all right when
                  we get the fifty thousand dollars, you ought to do away with all hard feelings, as
                  we are now, in kinder sorts, partners."</p>
               <p>"I told you many times before," replied the interpreter, "that I had forgiven the
                  past; therefore, make no mention about it."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but Walsh, I'm kinder suspicious of you and that girl. In the first place,
                  Hosamarea has sounded me several times as to her purchase, until I threatened to
                  bring him before the council, when he begged my pardon, and made it all right with
                  me on that score; still, I say I'm dubious of that girl of yours."</p>
               <p>"Well," responded Walsh, "it is beyond my comprehension, how so brave a man as you
                  are known to be, should be jealous of a deaf mute. Why, man, she is as harmless as
                  a child."</p>
               <p>"Anything that can make or give signs, can count by signs also. I've tried to keep
                  old Carmine's daughter and her apart, but Hosamarea has granted them permission to
                  stroll around the camp together. And I did not like to refuse my consent for fear
                  of getting the stinking old squaw hags down on me. But my Mexican woman will see
                  that not much harm comes of it.</p>
               <p>"I must give you credit for one thing, Joe," said the interpreter, looking
                  serious, "and that is your never having permitted any Indian to insult her, and
                  you yourself have been kind to her."</p>
               <p>"Why should I not?" replied the traitor, springing to his feet, and slapping his
                  broad, open chest with his right hand, "why should I not? I have no cause to abuse
                  the girl whom I knew and fondled while young. I want no misery from her, and
                  impose no punishment on her. Nothin' 'gin her mother as I knows of; but old
                  Carmine is a thief, and I want his money, and took this way to get it. I should
                  like to see any of the infernal red-skins try to insult her—their yellow blood
                  would soon spile the ground. In truth, I don't think I would like to see any white
                  woman abused by them; nor would I 'low it if I could prevent it without breaking
                  the law, and run a chance of losing my own life. But I say, I can't help being
                  suspicious of you and that woman, and now you have it in the old way—a full
                  confession."</p>
               <p>"It's all very well," replied Walsh, trying to look indignant, "suspicion is one
                  things, and fact is another. You think because you tricked me, I intend to revenge
                  myself. Quite natural on your part. All guilty consciences feel so. But I never
                  let my private feelings interfere with my business. So you can sleep on my
                  honesty. I tell you the Colonel will send you an offer of goods, and may be
                  Carmine will add a good pile of silver to it, to ransom his daughter, and you had
                  better accept the bundles."</p>
               <p>"I knew you were not here for nothing, Walsh," exultingly exclaimed Powderhorn, as
                  he knocked the ashes from his pipe. "Now, whose the fool? I suspected your being
                  an emissary, but I wanted you to light your own fire, and expose yourself by your
                  own smoke. I say, they shall not have her unless they pay<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000045"/> the money; and you better look out for your
                  cranium, too, since that deadest of shots, Deerheel, with his friend, that
                  dare-devil Wacco, is guarding the path back to the Fort. Ah, ha!" he exultingly
                  continued, as he saw a shudder pass over Walsh's form; "who now holds the best
                  hand?"</p>
               <p>"Well," replied Walsh, "you were as much concerned in it as I was."</p>
               <p>"No, no, sir; I did not profess to be his friend, and betray him, as Joseph's
                  brothers did, to his enemies. Ah, you wince under my fire! Now continue to play
                  your little game if you dare."</p>
               <p>After Powderhorn had spoken they both remained silent for a spell, when Walsh
                  aroused himself from the lethargic state into which the traitor's badinage had
                  thrown him, and then bidding his amiable companion a slight adieu, went in search
                  of Hosamarea.</p>
               <p>Though Powderhorn was rash and foolish in his sudden ebolitions of passion, he was
                  cautious in all moves where money was at stake, or a point of policy was to be
                  employed in getting it into his possession. He had sounded Walsh in many ways, and
                  upon all convenient occasions, as to the real object of his second visit to the
                  camp; and though he feigned to believe that he had discovered the motive which
                  induced him to return the woman, yet he was not at all satisfied that it was the
                  object of his visit, nor did he doubt that the Colonel had sent to offer
                  merchandise in exchange for the girl. He believed there was some trickery and
                  underhand maneuvering to outwit him and obtain the price of her ransom, and that
                  they were trying to turn the cold shoulder toward him. Among the young chiefs he
                  was a special favorite, and with the old sachems he was relied on as one capable
                  of giving sound advice in war matters against the whites. He knew well that
                  Hosamarea would not venture to openly oppose him, for it was not that chief's tact
                  to place himself in a defiant altitude against any one of the braves—even to the
                  least popular or most useless members of the tribe; but in all cases his crafty
                  cunning was exerted to humble and conquer by stratagem or hypocrisy, and it was in
                  the use and abuse of such weapons of policy that he feared the chief, and when
                  Walsh left him, he muttered to himself: "Either the money or the girl's life, and
                  Hosamarea and Walsh to boot," and then assuming as composed an expression of
                  countenance as possible, he sought a band of young braves who were starting upon a
                  hunting expedition.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the band taken its departure when there appeared to be considerable
                  commotion among the inhabitants—especially was this observable before the tents of
                  the chief, from which the squaws, old and young, were seen to issue with smiling
                  faces and in large numbers, and the cause of this pleasant and universal
                  excitement was the near approach of the Mexican merchant.</p>
               <p>Before long he made his appearance with his pack-mules and Mexican and Indian
                  drivers, and very shortly had his packs opened and his wares spread upon the
                  ground in the centre of the village, around which the whole tribe assembled to
                  purchase or to trade in exchange. The women brought forth their worked moccasins,
                  cane baskets beautifully colored, of varied hues, hunting-shirts and trowsers, all
                  made of skins of the deer or other animals, softly and neatly dressed. Also dried
                  meats and mesquite beans, and medicinal roots possessing many healing qualities;
                  and not least among the articles of traffic are their saddle-ponies, in exchange
                  for which the merchant gives powder, lead, steel arrowheads, tomahawks and
                  lance-heads, ribbons, beads, small looking-glasses and combs, and other
                  merchandise.</p>
               <p>The Indian sits himself down upon the ground, the broad canopy of the heavens his
                  roof and the wide extended domain of earth his bed, and foot-stool and final
                  resting place. Seldom if ever does the Indian, in his highest pitch of excitement,
                  foul the air with a curse of defiance against his Creator. The Great Spirit has
                  stamped his image upon his brow; he fears and honors Him in this life, and relies
                  upon him to protect and direct him in the happy hunting-ground beyond the grave.
                  In the lightning he beholds His glance, and in the thunder he hears His awful
                  voice. The Indian will seldom if ever be the first to deceive, but the moment he
                  feels any one so inclined, he hesitates not to return fraud with deception. He
                  loathes and spurns a coward, and honors bravery even in a foe. The scalp of an
                  enemy shot in the back is always placed lowest near the ground on the string of
                  hairy trophies hanging in his wigwam.</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5694-00000046"/>
               <p>In the circling war-dance the scalp is left trailing upon the earth, and the
                  braver an enemy has fought the more his scalp is honored and respected in memory
                  by all nations, even after death.</p>
               <p>Miss Lucy Carmine had been led out of her tent by her women guardians to view the
                  Mexican's wares as they were displayed before her, spread upon buffalo-robes
                  stretched upon the ground. Among a number of various fancy calicoes and gaudy silk
                  patterns and serapes there was nothing she so much admired as the blankets and
                  cloaks. The color of these was of a rich vermilion dye, and so brilliant in the
                  luster of their hue as fairly to dazzle the eye of even the careless observer.</p>
               <p>In dressing a deerskin, and curing the haired buffalo-robe, the Indian has no
                  equal, and in richness of coloring of blankets and other woven goods, they are
                  unsurpassed by any manufacturing establishment of the present day.</p>
               <p>The squaws and children and old men gathered around the merchant, who exposed his
                  wares with a careless indifference, as though assured that no article would be
                  stolen, and that all things belonging to him would be respected with a scrupulous
                  zeal of honesty worthy to be imitated by many a more civilized nation. Through the
                  dark ravine across the sandy plain, over the rocky mountain, amid the dense
                  chaparral, he was equally free from all fear of harm, for commerce among the
                  Indians was not only protected, but encouraged; and they were well aware that
                  should they rob the merchant, or even retard his free travel between their
                  villages, he would come no more and they would be deprived of the privilege of
                  buying his goods and groceries, and the chances of selling their booty which they
                  had stolen from the whites, or the spoils of war won in battle.</p>
               <p>With this digression, we return to Miss Carmine, who was standing between her two
                  attendants viewing the articles displayed for sale. Her rich, dark, auburn hair,
                  confined by a red ribbon, hung down her back in glossy curls, reflecting a deep
                  golden hue whenever the sun's rays mingled with them in caressing beams of
                  lustrous glare, and then striking askance her even and polished brow, almost gave
                  her the appearance of a supernatural being—an ideal form of loveliness and beauty
                  enrapturing and inspiring to behold. The eyes were of a soft, subduing blue, her
                  nose, slightly Roman, was well suited to her oval face; but she possessed that
                  fine receding brow, so becoming in a woman, and so childish in a man, and so
                  quickly observed at the first glance of a spectator. Her dress was a red <choice>
                     <sic>wollen</sic>
                     <corr>woolen</corr>
                  </choice> skirt, with a Mexican serape thrown across her shoulders extending
                  almost to her very feet. The merchant glanced hurriedly around upon his circle of
                  customers, and then fixed his eyes upon the girl's enchanting face. As often as he
                  had been called to inspect the slaves captured by the Indians and sold into
                  slavery to the Mexicans, he never on any previous occasion had been permitted to
                  view so finely a formed young woman, and one who possessed so many attractive
                  charms of person. His gaze began constantly to wander toward her attendants and
                  herself, which they perceiving, requested Lucy to accompany them back again to her
                  prison tent, yet all circumstances considered, not an unpleasant one. In other
                  words, it afforded an indulgence of more comforts, probably, than any other
                  captive's held by the Indians.</p>
               <p>Gascaro, the Mexican Merchant, was a person of great consequence in the town where
                  he lived in Mexico. He had acquired considerable substance of one kind or another,
                  and this accumulation had been purchased by many trials, risks, and much labor.
                  Early in the fall he selected from his large herd the finest mules; these he
                  placed in charge of his peons and Indians, and after packing them with
                  merchandise, would start for the nearest Indian villages and begin bartering away
                  his goods. As early autumn advanced he sought the villages higher up the mountain,
                  upon the plateaux of which the Comanches had selected their winter quarters, and
                  thus it was that we find him in the great village of Hosamarea's tribe.</p>
               <p>Gascaro had seen and admired the fair captive, Lucy Carmine. In his judgement she
                  appeared the fairest and most beautiful woman he had viewed in his many years of
                  travel through the States or Mexico. No doubt Lucy's loveliness was enhanced by
                  the contrast of all surrounding objects, which served to set off her comeliness of
                  person to great advantage. Be this as it may,<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000047"/> the merchant's imagination was busily at work
                  during the whole night, and even in his restless dreams the image of the fair,
                  innocent captive haunted his slumbers. Long before night he had ascertained to
                  whom she belonged, and resolved to purchase her, should it cost one-half his
                  fortune. On the following morning he endeavored to again behold the real face and
                  body which had so disturbed his dreams, but in this he was prevented by the
                  village guard, and finding he could not trespass upon forbidden ground, he
                  impatiently awaited the arrival of Powderhorn Joe. It was already noon before the
                  traitor came into camp at the head of some forty hunters. They had met with
                  excellent success, and returned with large quantities of buffalo meat. The two had
                  met many a time during the previous summer, and might be considered more than
                  acquaintances: they were friends—in a general use of the phrase—as the Comanche
                  says, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">bobachilla</foreign>, good friend. Both expressed
                  the greatest joy at meeting. Powderhorn invited the merchant to his tent, and
                  would take no denial. The Mexican having furnished extra luxuries, their supper
                  that night was almost a royal feast for two hungry men, both in the full vigor of
                  manhood, Gascaro's figure was tall and well proportioned, with an intelligent and
                  expressive face, and endowed with considerable polish in his manner, but the
                  traitor was solid and strong in his walk, and harsh and forbidding in his whole
                  aspect.</p>
               <p>While smoking their cigarettes after supper, the Mexican observed, with an
                  inquisitive tone of voice, speaking in Spanish:</p>
               <p>"I see, my old friend, that you have got quite a decent seniorita in your camp. I
                  wish I knew to whom she belongs, I think I could find a master for her at a right
                  good price."</p>
               <p>"She's my money chest," quietly observed Powderhorn. "I won her in battle, and she
                  is that old thieving Carmine's daughter at the Fort."</p>
               <p>"Then you are most fortunate—I may say blessed," said the Mexican as he arose and
                  offered his hand to his companion. "It is not every land that can produce such
                  flowers."</p>
               <p>"You may well say so," replied the captor, "I value her at fifty thousand dollars,
                  and not one cent less, and I'll get it."</p>
               <p>"It's a big figure," remarked Gascaro, "better get rid of her while the bloom is
                  on her cheek. I once owned a lovely maiden, and refused large offers for her, and
                  as sure as I live she sickened with the small-pox. You had better take my advice
                  and let me sell her for you in Mexico."</p>
               <p>"Never that," replied Powderhorn, "unless to some one richer than I am."</p>
               <p>"Well," said the Mexican, "I give you the advice gratis, you can act on it or not,
                  just as you please. You don't love the girl it seems, and therefore where's the
                  use of keeping her confined in that narrow tent. You're like a man who hides away
                  his money—too mean to use it himself and too selfish to let others do good with
                  it. I say I can take her to Mexico."</p>
               <p>"You can, can you?" interrupted Powderhorn, slightly coloring; "allow me to say
                  that I can attend to my own business. I've lived thus far in life without
                  assistance or advice from my own people, and when I ask them from strange or
                  foreign people, I'd better seek a mansion in the skies."</p>
               <p>"You Americanos are all alike," replied the Mexican smiling pleasantly through his
                  dancing black eyes. "But as the subject seems to displease you, let us go to the
                  big tent and try our luck at monte."</p>
               <p>"That's as good a way as any to kill time in this swill-tub hole," rejoined the
                  American, "and be sure you bring plenty of rhino with you, as I feel in luck
                  to-night."</p>
               <p>"Never fear, I'll try and pay my debts, though I'm told you bet high in this
                  latitude," said Gascaro with a careless wave of his left hand as he re-lighted his
                  cigarette.</p>
               <p>The two gamblers proceeded to a long, narrow building covered entirely with
                  bull-skins, containing several round, roughly hewed tables. This abode was used
                  for a kind of junk-house by the owner, and also as a gaming-house in wet weather.
                  Over these tables were spread Mexican blankets, and many were betting small sums
                  against the dealer when the two entered. They both looked on in silence for
                  several minutes, when, by a lucky put down, one of the chiefs cleaned out the
                  dealer, whereupon a loud huzza arose from the excited mass. The bank was
                     <unclear>broken</unclear>, but the master hand was near to replenish the
                  exhausted <unclear>ary</unclear>, and though the unfortunate banker left the table
                     looking<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5694-00000048"/> ing like a whipped cur, he
                  failed not to recognize among the crowd his backer, Gascaro, who gave him a sign,
                  and then remarked:</p>
               <p>"If it is so agreed, men, am willing to try my luck and take the dealer's place. I
                  think I can run a muck and not become so easily exhausted as yon miserable slave
                  of fortune."</p>
               <p>To this proposal a loud shout of assent rent the air, and Gascaro, after divesting
                  himself of his serape, took his seat as dealer at the table. A silence followed
                  the wild scene of excitement as the Mexican cast his well filled purse of golden
                  coin upon the table. Gascaro had a pleasant way with him. He gracefully and
                  smilingly acknowledged the compliments of the small bets, and paid the winners
                  with such cheerful good will as to cast a glow of sympathetic good humor around
                  the whole circle. The bank began to lose repeatedly, and the eagerness for play
                  became contagious; still, Powderhorn Joe only ventured a few dollars—nor was he
                  regular in making his bets; but yet he was satisfied, for he invariably won. As
                  the keen eye of the banker flashed from face to face, from form to form, it seemed
                  to linger longer upon the visage of the traitor. But be this as it may, he called
                  to one of his peons, then speaking in a whisper, the servant soon disappeared and
                  as quickly re-appeared with several small tin cups, and several bottles of mescal
                  wine, and was followed by others with two cakes <foreign xml:lang="SPA">de pelon
                     azucar</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="SPA">peloncy</foreign> (loaf sugar.)
                  Gracefully leaving his seat, he took possession of the cups, and after serving
                  Powderhorn to a stout horn, he went from person to person, always serving the
                  nearest chief with particular regard to his rank. He then resumed his seat at the
                  gambling table.</p>
               <p>The Indian has little regard as to time. The moon is his time-piece. By its
                  increase or waning, tribes are governed, hunting parties arranged for the chase,
                  their maize planted and their war expeditions undertaken—in fact he seems
                  oblivious to the fleeting hours of existence.</p>
               <p>The merchant had lost heavily; still he served his customers with the same
                  graceful facility as at the beginning of the game. He frequently served his
                  patrons with wine, and always resumed his seat pleasantly smiling, and most
                  graciously requesting his antagonists to make their game. The wine had not only
                  produced its effect upon the younger chiefs, but the older and more cautious began
                  to be considerably exalted by its influence, among whom was Powderhorn Joe, who
                  commenced betting in a reckless manner, and yet with reasonable luck. The bank now
                  began to more than hold its own, when the traitor, who was as famous for breaking
                  banks as he was notorious for leading a war charge proposed to cast dice for their
                  respective piles.</p>
               <p>"Certainly," replied Gascaro; "I think the rest will be satisfied, as the bank is
                  loser."</p>
               <p>There being no objection on the part of the winners, the two master-spirits urged
                  the contest. The dice were furnished by Powderhorn, and he felt assured that not
                  only could he not be heated, but that his luck far surpassed that of any Mexican
                  or Indian chief in the village. So at it they went, when the traitor lost and his
                  pile of <foreign xml:lang="SPA">dineros</foreign> was raked in by the merchant
                  amid the loud applause of the laughing and excited crowd.</p>
               <p>"Oh, laugh on," said the loser; "but we shall see where the laugh is! I shall
                  return and that pile will yet be mine; I was never yet known to give way in battle
                  or suffer defeat at a game of cards. So wait my return!"</p>
               <p>"Pardon, my friend," said the winner; "be not angry! come, join me in a glass
                  before you depart. Luck is so singular in its workings that I may leave this
                  village a beggar, but allow me to respond to your boast."</p>
               <p>Gascaro was never willing to receive more than dame Fortune was pleased to grant
                  him, or to refuse an opponent his revenge.</p>
               <p>"We'll try you," responded the loser; "but I shall drink with you so as to meet
                  upon equal terms of friendship."</p>
               <p>And so they drank and parted as friends, only to meet again in a few moments to
                  renew their game of dice. Powderhorn brought a tin can, the same in which he had
                  deposited his portion of the gold received from Walsh. As the news of the contest
                  was spread through the village, a large circle of spectators had assembled to
                  witness the desperate game between the rival players. The merchant continued to
                  win, and Powderhorn to keep up his courage by drinking more freely of the wine,<pb
                     n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5694-00000049"/> which the merchant joined, but not in
                  such copious draughts. One-half hour of reckless and ruinous playing, and the
                  half-drunk chief rose cursing and damning his hard luck; and then steadying his
                  tall, powerful body against one of the posts of the tent, he thus addressed the
                  merchant:</p>
               <p>"I am now without gold or money of any kind; you have won it all: but I yet have
                  many ponies, blankets, guns and skins, and a gold watch."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, my friend," replied the Mexican; "did I not fairly win your money? can
                  you or our good friends say otherwise?" said he, smiling upon the crowd, and
                  ordering his servants to wait upon them with wine.</p>
               <p>A shout of approbation followed this appeal. When silence was restored, Powderhorn
                  spoke:</p>
               <p>"You needs must have won it fairly, since we played with my own dice; but, as I
                  was going to state, my gold and silver is all gone, yet I have other things for
                  which you must give me a chance."</p>
               <p>"You can do without your gold," replied the merchant, "but the articles you
                  mention would only be an encumbrance to me. Why not sell them to some one knowing
                  their value—reducing them to money, the true and legitimate article of play. I
                  shall await your coming."</p>
               <p>The traitor took the advice, and in about an hour returned with an ample supply of
                  coin; when they again went on with the game—with the same unfortunate results for
                  Powderhorn. When he arose from the table and stoically gathered his blanket around
                  his compact body, and was forcing his way through the crowd of braves and squaws,
                  who jeered and laughed at him, the merchant called him, observing:</p>
               <p>"My friend, you have one very pretty slave in your possession. Will you stake her
                  against all my winnings?"</p>
               <p>The chagrined and desperate gambler hesitated, then returning to the table,
                  resumed his seat, and, after placing his elbows upon the boards, and resting his
                  head between his hands, as one in deep thought, remained quiet for several
                  moments, when turning his sullen glance upon the Mexican, he slowly spoke the
                  words—</p>
               <p>"I will!"</p>
               <p>"And you promise to surrender her to me by early dawn tomorrow?" asked the
                  merchant.</p>
               <p>"No, replied the loser; "not until noon to-morrow; at midday—that is, if I
                  lose."</p>
               <p>"Then be it so," responded the merchant, and he produced upon the table all the
                  money he had won from his opponent. The dice were shaken, the die was cast, and
                  Lucy Carmine became the slave of Gascaro, the Mexican merchant.</p>
               <p>"She is mine!" said he.</p>
               <p>"Yes! and cursed be the day that brought me into life!" responded the chief, as he
                  passed out through the silent throng of spectators, with a heart as heavy as lead,
                  and a brain heated almost to madness.</p>
               <p>He went not to his tent, but sought that of Hosamarea, where he remained a long
                  time in conversation, and then betook himself to a tent where Walsh was sleeping,
                  to whom he communicated all his misfortunes, and requested both advice and
                  assistance. The interpreter was shocked, startled by the news. He saw at a glance
                  that he was about to lose his two thousand dollars, and that his fate was scaled
                  by Deerheel or Wacco, for he had consoled himself with the thought that if he
                  could report to the scout the name of the real criminal in the matter of his
                  capture, and that if he proved serviceable in rescuing Lucy, he would be forgiven
                  by her interceding in his behalf. But now what chance was there of his either
                  getting the money, or being secure of his life if he returned to the Fort.</p>
               <p>"You had better appeal to Hosamarea to aid you," said Walsh.</p>
               <p>But Powderhorn shook his head, and replied:</p>
               <p>"In such matters he is as immovable as any mountain."</p>
               <p>"Then have a council called, and take the vote," again urged the interpreter.</p>
               <p>"It will be of no use. They will not interfere," seriously rejoined the despondent
                  gambler. "Their faith is pledged with these traders; they will never offend them.
                  They furnish the tribe with weapons and ammunition to kill their game and resist
                  their enemies. Not to have our people comply with their bargains<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000050"/> gains and contracts, through the council's
                  interference, you will never witness. It's a dead halt, Walsh."</p>
               <p>"Well," replied Walsh, who was almost stupefied by the turn affairs had taken,
                  "for the soul of me, I can't see how you could be such a fool!"</p>
               <p>"It matters not now; it's a known fact all over the village. and when he demands
                  Lucy Carmine I will be compelled to deliver her into his possession."</p>
               <p>"Then I will go to him now," said Walsh, "and offer him the fifty thousand dollars
                  I was told to give you in case you were obstinate, and held out firm to the
                  last."</p>
               <p>"O, villain!" almost shouted Powderhorn in his agony of spirit; "why did you not
                  tell me of this before?"</p>
               <p>"Because," answered Walsh, "you wanted all the purchase money for yourself."</p>
               <p>"I say you have acted like a base cur; you have betrayed me," growled the now
                  angered chief.</p>
               <p>"Take care," responded the interpreter; "take back your remarks, you lying dog!"
                  and Walsh sprung to his feet, with his drawn knife firmly grasped in his right
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"I say you have betrayed me. I neither fear hell, nor you, nor any of your button
                  braves at the Fort. I'm your man."</p>
               <p>At this moment the guard entered, and, with arrows drawn upon both the quarreling
                  knaves, bade them stand and deliver.</p>
               <p> "'Tis well for you," continued Powderhorn, "that your devilish mute has brought
                  these people to your rescue."</p>
               <p>And true it was, for there stood Marie among the guard, with apron to her eyes,
                  and pointing to the two disputants. The girl had heard the news, and having sought
                  Walsh to ascertain if it were true, she had heard the whole story, and fearing
                  bloodshed, had brought the village guard to separate the enraged combatants. With
                  bows sprung and arrows pointed—leveled at their breasts—the interpreter and the
                  almost maddened chief were compelled to throw up their arms, and were arrested—for
                  the Indian law is certain in its operations, bearing with equal rigor and justice
                  upon all, without distinction of persons, and justice is meted out to high and low
                  with an even hand, and with a sure aim to punishment, if found guilty by the
                  village council. They were both marched to prison, the guard enclosing them on all
                  sides. Powderhorn Joe was the first to speak as they were urged along:</p>
               <p>"Walsh," said he, "this is nonsense; I have been a little stupefied, but let us
                  act as men in this quarrel; we can gain nothing by being enemies—we have all to
                  lose; we will seem friends at least, if you don't mean it."</p>
               <p>"I think it's best," replied Walsh; "you speak to the chief at the prison door and
                  make it appear all a mistake."</p>
               <p>"You act wisely," said the traitor, "for, as true as I live, I now remember seeing
                  Wacco's face among the crowd around the table."</p>
               <p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Walsh.</p>
               <p>"True as I live!" responded his fellow-prisoner.</p>
               <p>"Then we are sworn friends," whispered the interpreter as he silently pressed the
                  chief's hand.</p>
               <p>When they reached the prison-house, both parties explained away any animosity of
                  feeling, and they were permitted to depart, when they betook themselves to the
                  tent which had been assigned to the interpreter, where they sat until near
                  daylight concocting plans to deceive the merchant, and when Powderhorn left the
                  tent, he remarked, with a heavy, swinging <choice>
                     <sic>jesture</sic>
                     <corr>gesture</corr>
                  </choice> of his ponderous right arm:</p>
               <p>"If Marie will only do this deed for us, Awe are all safe—and we'll divide the
                  money."</p>
               <p>"Rest quiet; I know she will not refuse—so well can she take care of herself in
                  the future as in the past," rejoined Walsh.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>LUCY CARMINE—innocent Lucy! was sleeping in profound repose upon her
                  buffalo robes, dreaming of her native home—singing before her cottage door those
                  sweet songs with which she was wont to cheer her mother during the many days of
                  her father's absence. She saw the bright, glowing roses along the garden walks,
                  and inhaled the fragrance of their blooming freshness, and heard the robbin and
                  the mocking-bird vie in their melodies with the thrush and lark in the neighboring
                  groves and trees. Great was her disappointment when she awoke at early dawn and
                  looked from her tent upon the long row of Indian tents and wigwams. The beautiful
                  and familiar scenes of her childhood had vanished into airy nothingness; she no
                  longer inhaled the delightful odor of the flowers which had been nourished with
                  tender care by her youthful and attentive hand, and the caged canary-bird which
                  hung on the porch of her cottage home no longer replied to her cheerful voice of
                  greeting; her mother's gentle voice of welcome no longer greeted her with the call
                  of affection. Though sorrowful at heart, yet the ruddy blush of morn imparted a
                  mellow glow of health to her damask cheeks, which contrasted finely with the
                  snow-white purity of her girlish brow. As she turned to her attendants, or rather
                  constant spies upon her actions, she was curiously struck by observing
                  tear-glistening in their eyes. Smiling, she took a hand of each between tween her
                  own soft, tapering fingers, and steadfastly gazing with a fixed, earnest look of
                  inquiry into their faces, strove to learn the cause of their sorrow, but they only
                  wept the more. Little deeming that their tears were shed for her loss to them, she
                  sought to soothe their grief, thinking they were mourning over the misery which
                  slavery entailed upon the captive, or were suffering in heart from some harsh
                  treatment upon the part of their captors. As the wild bird, with his native
                  impulse of gushing song, startles the resting hunter reposing beneath some forest
                  tree, so her full, musical voice swelled into notes of sweetest harmony, and these
                  were the words of the song she sung: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Awake with the dawn, for my deer-bounding rover</l>
                        <l>Has hied to the chase while the dew's on the clover;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Boldly he startles the wolf from his plunder,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Nor leaves he the trail for the torrent or thunder.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>His tomahawk gleams with the morning's bright luster;</l>
                        <l>He rallies his braves, as for a field muster;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">So calm is his courage, so swift, sure his steed,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">That none can excel or take from him the lead.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>He's handsome, he's stylish—a flash in my eye,</l>
                        <l>His dashing brave image oft passes me by;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">His love, it is true as his dagger of steel,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">His name is the scout—the fearless Deerheel.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So affected were the Mexican women by the sweet melody of her voice that they cast
                  themselves upon their knees beside her and, clasping her hands and pressing them
                  to their lips, suffused them with their tears and impressed them with kisses.</p>
               <p>As the last lingering notes of her song died upon the roseate air, the curtain of
                  her tent was drawn aside and the stalwart form of Powderhorn Joe was presented
                  full to view as, with scowling visage, thus he spoke:</p>
               <p>"Noble or ignoble, Deerheel will never hear you sing that song: the scout is dead,
                  and the wolves he hunted have feasted upon his bones. Lucy, it is useless to cry,
                  my child," he continued, as he saw the tears dimming her eves and her cheeks to
                  turn very pale; "he has taken his last hunt amid these hills: he<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000052"/> now cracks his rifle among the trees in the happy
                  hunting grounds above."</p>
               <p>These last taunting remarks were accompanied with a sneering laugh, as he
                  added:</p>
               <p>"I will have to take possession of your tent for a few hours, Lucy, as I have
                  another occupant. Ho! Walsh! bring forth your beautiful mute!"</p>
               <p>And the interpreter led Marie—smiling Marie, the actress into the tent. As Walsh
                  caught sight of Carmine's daughter, his face turned crimson red, and he cast an
                  indignant look upon the traitor, who was speaking privately some hurried words in
                  Spanish to the Mexican women. He then called Walsh from the tent and held a
                  private conference with him, while the Mexican women threw a blanket over Lucy's
                  shoulders, and a serape around her head, and led her into the back room of the
                  tent, then through a door into the open air, and then across several wide streets,
                  until they came to a small hut where they tarried with her.</p>
               <p>If we have proved tedious in our perhaps too minute description of village life
                  and tent scenes among the Comanches, we can only say that they made so strong an
                  impression upon the narrator of this story, as scarcely to be forgotten by any of
                  the parties knowing of these events, and no doubt a more lasting and endurable
                  stamp upon all, each and every one of the actors and participants in these
                  mountain trials of border life.</p>
               <p>All was quiet in the village, and there was scarcely any commotion visible along
                  the straight line of tents and bark huts, save as here and there a squaw's head
                  was seen to peer out at a door as though anxiously expecting some event, and as
                  quickly withdrawn—for there was no unusual stir apparent in street or tent. At the
                  lower end of the village, towards the south, where the road led into the main
                  street, stood two isolated, bald rocks, upon each of which, night and day,
                  sentinels were posted. On this road, within the village, the Mexican merchant was
                  seen awaiting the coming of Powderhorn Joe and his captive slave. His pack-mules,
                  some thirty in number, were loitering around, picking the scant morsels of herbage
                  growing near the rocks, with their burdens of merchandise securely tied with
                  lariats and straps upon their backs. It was near the mid-hour of day, when
                  Hosamarea, Powderhorn Joe, Walsh, and several other chiefs of the traitor's band
                  were seen to approach, attending upon a female in gaudy dress-work arrayed. The
                  merchant hastily advanced to meet them, and smiling in the most approved way of
                  Mexican gallantry, offered his hand to the chief, then to Powderhorn, and also to
                  Walsh; but his smiles turned to angry looks when his eyes rested upon Marie, who
                  smilingly advanced, offered her hand, and then took her station beside her new
                  master. Powderhorn cut short all protestations on the merchant's part, as he
                  spoke:</p>
               <p>"I have brought our great chief; Hosamarea, to witness the full payment of my
                  debt, fairly and honorably won by you. I also bring you the bill of sale. She is
                  now yours—though I would not have parted with her for twice the sum. Be of good
                  cheer, Marie; you have got a kind master, and one who will learn to love and
                  respect you for your silence."</p>
               <p>This was an act in the drama of life in which the actress delighted. She spoke not
                  in reply, nor did she seem to notice the remark with her ears, but making signs of
                  sorrow to the traitor, she cast herself at the merchant's feet upon her knees, and
                  then kissed his hands with profound ardor, and looked most pleadingly into his
                  face; but she failed to remove the anger which had gathered upon his brow. He
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"This is not the slave I won: this is a different woman: you are imposing upon me,
                  Powderhorn; I shall not be swindled in this style; take her away and bring me the
                  trader's daughter: she only will I have; I will appeal to the council."</p>
               <p>"I have five women-slaves whom I have won in battle; of all those taken, this is
                  the handsomest," replied Powderhorn; "I thought you alluded to this one, as she is
                  the healthiest and freshest among them—and this is the only one free from
                  mortgage; the trader's daughter is pledged to this man, Walsh—whom you know—for
                  five thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"I will pay that sum," rejoined the merchant, "and take you at what you say—only,
                  bring her forth and comply with your word of honor, as a true chief of the great
                  Comanche nation."</p>
               <p>Powderhorn thus rejoined:</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5694-00000053"/>
               <p>"Had you met us at her tent, as agreed, we might, possibly, have let you had the
                  trader's daughter, but she is too unwell to travel, and I don't think the women
                  would have suffered you to take so great an invalid from the village. But there is
                  one other difficulty in the way: Walsh here, fearing that I will gamble her off to
                  some other merchant when she has recovered, has bargained for her, and sent off a
                  messenger to bring the money from the Fort."</p>
               <p>"I see you are full of knavish excuses," replied the merchant. "Great Chief!
                  Father of the Great Comanche Nation! I appeal to you!" exclaimed the merchant, in
                  a supplicating tone of voice; "shall I not have the trader's daughter, won by me?
                  fairly, squarely won, according to Powderhorn's own confession."</p>
               <p>"There appears to be a mistake in this matter as to which of his slaves you won,
                  or played for. You insist upon having won the trader's daughter; he says
                  otherwise. There is no proof that any particular slave was mentioned, and he
                  brings you what he considers his prettiest slave. Now, in all cases of
                  doubt—especially when the loser seems willing to comply, and does comply, with his
                  contract as he believes it was agreed upon, and as no name was mentioned, I don't
                  believe the council would change my opinion or alter my decision: You ought,
                  therefore, to accept the slave he has brought you, who is healthy and
                  good-looking. The next time, I trust you will be more explicit in making your
                  bets."</p>
               <p>The chief spoke in Spanish, with deliberate consideration of the subject. The
                  merchant remained silent for a few seconds, and rejoined:</p>
               <p>"Great Chief, I must accept your decision as final. I am justly disappointed. Had
                  I thought he was in possession of another pale-face slave I would not have bet
                  with him unless he had reduced the contract to writing; but as it is, it is. Come,
                  girl, get upon this horse, and let us be off."</p>
               <p>And he motioned Marie to mount into the saddle on one of the mules, with which
                  order she readily complied, being assisted by Walsh. The merchant then mounted his
                  mule, and after bidding the chiefs—not forgetting the traitor—a graceful good-day,
                  he drove Marie's mule before him, and was soon lost to sight both of the village
                  and the chiefs. The whole scheme of imposition practiced upon the merchant was
                  concocted by Walsh and Marie, and this was backed up by Powderhorn promising to
                  divide the fifty thousand dollars with the interpreter, and agreeing to get
                  Deerheel into his possession, and then kill him, or else to waylay and assassinate
                  him, and so save the interpreter's life. Walsh had told Marie the whole affair,
                  and that the only way to save Lucy's life would be for her to consent to go with
                  the merchant as his slave for a little while, and that they would intercept him
                  before the morrow's sun had set and again restore her to the freedom of the
                  village. The volatile, yet noble-hearted girl readily consented to this
                  proposition, to save Lucy Carmine, and as it had a dash of the daring about it,
                  she as eagerly consented to play her part in this, as she had on the previous
                  occasion in the exchange with Walsh. The two knaves, cowardly dogs and miscreants
                  knew well it would cost both their lives to interfere with the merchant, so they
                  resolved to leave their victim to her fate, and without one pitying feeling of
                  remorse, consigned her once more to slavery. But there was a truer, a braver, and
                  a nobler hearted man hastening to succor the friendless actress, and once more
                  restore her to liberty; that freedom of which she so exultingly boasted on her
                  first appearance at the Fort.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IT was near sundown when a hunter, rifle in hand and panting for
                  breath, ascended at an almost running gait a narrow ravine some ten miles from the
                  village. There was a mountain path, plainly worn, leading along the mountain's
                  base. At this point another well defined trail joined the main broad path, but
                  gradually led off into the valley of the plain below. The hunter was almost
                  gasping for air; the sweat was dripping from his forehead and temples; but while
                  thus laboring under the edict of the violent exertion he had displayed in running,
                  he listened attentively, and then grasping his rifle, he stilled his breath and
                  prepared his weapon for instant service. He was evidently there for some urgent
                  purpose, for he intently directed his sight to the path. Shortly after this, the
                  foremost animals of the merchant's mule trail made their appearance, being urged
                  on by the whips of the peon half-breeds; and safely they trotted along the rocky
                  path, but they were over two hundred yards from where the hunter stood. Last of
                  all came the merchant, driving the mule upon which Marie was seated. At this
                  moment, the hunter raised the rifle to his shoulder; for an instant the barrel was
                  motionless, then came forth the flash from its point, and down went the merchant's
                  mule, its nose striking the hard rock-worn path, and then rolling over on its
                  side, it expired without a groan. Quickly disengaging himself, and the saddle-bags
                  containing his money and jewels, Gascaro almost dragged Marie from her saddle, and
                  mounting her mule, hurried on after the train as fast as whip and spur could drive
                  the sure-footed beast. So instantaneous had been the shooting and her displacement
                  from the mule, by the Mexican, that, though expecting a rescue, Marie was actually
                  stupefied with surprise. When he saw the effect produced by his shot, the hunter
                  slowly descended from the rock, and hastened, as well as a slightly sprained ankle
                  would permit, to receive into his arms one dearer than life to him. Marie was
                  seated upon the ground with her face hid in her hands when her deliverer
                  advanced:</p>
               <p>"Miss Lucy Carmine, I am true to Texas and her history: may we ever be found true
                  to justice and to liberty—accept this last as the only poor boon I have to offer
                  you."</p>
               <p>Marie turned her eyes upon her rescuer and their glances met, when an instant
                  recognition took place.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Monsieur Deerheel, you are one brave man; one gallant gentleman! I thought
                  you were dead! And you thought it was Mademoiselle Carmine you came to save? To
                  save her from slavery, I became one servant, and now you, her <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">amie</foreign> (lover), save me from the same fate! I am very
                  well glad to see you, brave gentleman! I salute you as my savior!"</p>
               <p>At this moment, she pointed to a rock and shrunk close behind the scout, who gave
                  a shrill, low whistle. and Wacco, panting and out of breath, staggered toward him.
                  He, too, had injured his leg in running over the rocks, and more seriously than
                  Deerheel, and it was owing to his lameness that he had fallen so far in rear of
                  the scout.</p>
               <p>"Good meat," said he, going to the mule; "all broke neck—no live more; die click,
                  click!" (which means quick, quick, in his language). No store-man's gal!" said he,
                  eyeing Marie; "Indian lie; maybe so, no lie Indian—white man say Indian. How far
                  break neck, Deerheel?" he asked.</p>
               <p>The scout pointed out the rock. Instantly, Wacco, lame as he was, took a direct
                  line and limped to the rock to measure the distance, for he possessed a wonderful
                  amount of curiosity. While he was gone Marie briefly related all that had taken
                  place at the village. When Wacco returned, the scout spoke for the first time:</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5694-00000055"/>
               <p>"It is too late for you to return to the village tonight; we will rake some leaves
                  and branches together and make as comfortable a bed for you as possible. At early
                  dawn you can take your departure. We will guard you for the night; you have only
                  to call and we will be within hearing distance. We will see you mounted. Our camp,
                  or rather cave, is many miles from here, and in our crippled condition we have to
                  make an early start on our return, as our only safety is in flight."</p>
               <p>Marie told him many pleasant anecdotes concerning Lucy, which had come to her
                  knowledge through the Mexican women. She also repeated to the scout the morning's
                  incident of the song, which his name was mentioned, and how Powderhorn Joe had
                  heard it all, and upbraided her, sarcastically remarking that "Deerheel is dead,
                  and hunting in the happy land of the chase," and how they found her in tears when
                  Marie had entered the tent to take her place as the slave won by the merchant. She
                  also stated that she was about to reward him with what she knew would be
                  considered an invaluable gift, and one to be dearly prized. She then took from her
                  pocket a photograph, which Mrs. Carmine had given to Walsh in older that he might
                  not again be imposed upon by Powderhorn Joe, and which was a true and recent
                  picture of Lucy Carmine, taken in New York before beginning their journey, and
                  which Walsh had given into her possession, to be preserved for subsequent use.</p>
               <p>"Thus you see, it seems like fate," she smilingly observed, "that we should be
                  thrown into each other's way; and that a kind Heaven encourages and rewards the
                  brave and constant;" and she added, as she presented it to him: "You had better
                  look at it before the darkness increases."</p>
               <p>But the scout hastily placed it within the pocket of his buck skin hunting-shirt,
                  and after sincerely thanking her for the gift, he told her that her bed of leaves
                  was ready, and whenever she felt disposed she could retire to her spacious
                  chamber, with the moon for her lamp and the stars for her sentinels. To which she
                  replied, with much feeling in her voice:</p>
               <p>"Monsieur Deerheel, you are truly a gallant gentleman; for, though you were
                  mistaken in the person you sought to rescue, you have proved yourself a true and
                  noble man, for you have expressed no regrets that you have been mistaken, and that
                  Lucy Carmine was not that person."</p>
               <p>"It must stand as it is. You were risking your life and freedom to preserve her
                  from a horrible fate, and by serving you, though unknowingly, I was rendering a
                  great service to Miss Carmine and myself."</p>
               <p>Not any of the three slept well that night. As for Marie, when she heard the whoop
                  of the owl, as agreed upon—the signal of "all's well," on the part of her
                  rescuers—she felt assured of safety, yet her strange and wild adventure proved
                  almost too much for her heroic spirit, and she remained awake during the greater
                  part of the night. As for the scout, his whole soul was exhilerated by the
                  occurrences of the day, but there was a calm, soothing influence pervading his
                  spirit which enabled him to think without the curse of remorse, and to indulge in
                  intervals of repose without fear of Indian or self-reproach. Wacco was like a
                  watch-dog—stooping and crawling from where the scout was lying to the mule;
                  cutting at the mule's flank until he had provided meat enough to last them several
                  days, or as much as they could both carry to their cave. When the morning broke,
                  Marie was led several miles on her way by Wacco, while the scout appointed a place
                  of meeting, and limped off, with meat upon one shoulder and his rifle on the
                  other; over rocks and through gullies he dragged his slow steps along, and when he
                  reached the point agreed upon between himself and Wacco he was foot-sore and
                  weary. Before night Wacco had joined him, and he stated that he had watched Marie
                  to within a few miles of the camp, where she was met by some squaws who were out
                  gathering berries, and joyfully received by them and was no doubt led to the
                  village.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IT was about an hour before sunset, when some twenty, or more,
                  squaws were seen entering the village through the gate by which the Mexican, with
                  his mule train and his slave Marie, had departed. Numerous children were
                  following, and, like the squaws, were carrying baskets upon their heads or backs,
                  filled with berries, beans and other mast usually obtainable in the forest during
                  this season of the year. Foremost among them appeared the actress, the bright and
                  varied color of her attire contrasting most conspicuously with the sack skirts of
                  the Indian women, the faded colors of which gave to their dress the appearance of
                  that brown, yellow tinge so peculiar to the forest leaves when first touched by
                  the early frost of autumn. Powderhorn Joe and Walsh were seated upon stools in the
                  tent of the latter, cozily smoking their pipes and congratulating themselves on
                  the artful manner in which they had imposed upon the merchant, and how dexterously
                  they had gotten rid of the mute, and were planning escape from the village and
                  nation when they should extort the fifty thousand dollars from Carmine, when, as
                  if dropped from some passing cloud, the mute girl Marie, stood before them, making
                  signs of greeting, while offering both a hand of friendship. The pipe Walsh was
                  smoking dropped from his lips, while the traitor started to his feet,
                  exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"By thunder and the devil! the witch has escaped and returned to harrass us
                  eternally!"</p>
               <p>Marie seemed not to heed his brutal remark, but motioning Walsh to get rid of his
                  beastly guest, she sat herself down upon the stool he had just left, for she was
                  jaded almost beyond frontier endurance. Walsh told his companion in treachery that
                  if he would leave him with the girl he would talk with her by writing and signs,
                  visit him at his tent and tell him all the news he could extract from her. To this
                  the traitor readily consented and instantly took his departure, and when all was
                  quiet, Marie spoke in a whisper:</p>
               <p>"So you left me to my fate, Monsieur Walsh, for all your promises to the
                  contrary?"</p>
               <p>And her lips quivered with a scornful, compressed and sneering curl.</p>
               <p>"Well," replied Walsh, as he armed himself by re-filling his pipe, "we were too
                  closely watched, and you know such matters, when our lives are concerned, must be
                  managed with care; and we knew where the merchant was going to trade, and intended
                  to send some one to buy you back, as being the most certain way to release
                  you."</p>
               <p>"O, yes," she replied, with still more bitterness, "at the village—when you knew
                  the merchant intended to return direct to Mexico to get more goods. Where would I
                  have been, and what would have become of me by that time? Now, Walsh, if you were
                  a man of any feeling, you could not have abandoned a woman to so cruel a fate,
                  especially one who was so willingly serving you in the cause in which we both
                  started out—the freedom of that poor girl."</p>
               <p>The interpreter averted his glance, and, like all criminals when exposed and their
                  guilt made manifest, preserved a dogged silence.</p>
               <p>The actress then continued:</p>
               <p>"It is but a poor, sneaking villain who would sell one of his own color into
                  slavery for the sake of aiding a renegade, a thief, and a kidnapper."</p>
               <p>In answer to this scathing rebuke, the scoundrel broke out into a loud, forced
                  laugh—intending to evince the satirical, but<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000057"/> it was so hollow in the middle, that it speedily
                  collapsed; and he then resorted to an endeavor to express indignant anger, as,
                  with an oath, he exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"If you insult me again I'll turn you over to the tender mercies of Powderhorn
                  Joe! So, dry up; and let me hear no more of your abuse and complaints. Now, answer
                  my questions with truth and civility."</p>
               <p>Marie saw at a glance that to provoke the interpreter further would be to endanger
                  her own safety, and replied:</p>
               <p>"I will tell you all about my escape: The merchant drove the mule upon which I was
                  seated, for ten miles along the path. Of course I could not speak to him, nor he
                  to me; we stopped several times when we came to water, when he would fill his cup,
                  pour some wine into it, and, after drinking himself would re-fill it and almost
                  compel me to drink. He appeared very angry and cursed you and Powderhorn with a
                  hearty good will. I say he drove my mule along until near sundown, when suddenly,
                  where two paths join, I heard the report of a rifle and saw the merchant's mule
                  fall stone-dead, without a struggle or a groan. Like me, he no doubt thought you
                  and Powderhorn were waylaying him with your band, and that safety must be sought
                  in instant fight. He dragged me from my mule, and snatching up his saddle-bags,
                  cast them upon the mule from which he had pulled me, instantly mounted and
                  galloped off after the mule-train. Not knowing what to do, or by whom I was
                  rescue, I sat down upon the ground and awaited events. I did not rest long before
                  a hunter approached and greeted me as Lucy Carmine. I turned my glance toward him,
                  when we both recognized each other."</p>
               <p>"And who, in God's name! could it have been?" quickly ejaculated Walsh.</p>
               <p>"Who else, Monsieur Walsh, could it be but Lucy's brave, handsome hunter,
                  Deerheel?"</p>
               <p>Instantly Walsh rushed toward her, and seizing her by both hands, which he forced
                  outstretched above her head, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"You devil, you lie! he is at the Fort. Tell me the truth, or I'll throttle you
                  this instant!"</p>
               <p>The actress stared at the cowardly, yet desperate, interpreter—hissing forth the
                  words between her teeth:</p>
               <p>"Yes, it was the scout; I know him well—and Wacco came up shortly after and cut
                  slices from the mule, and they provided me with a bed in the leaves, and next day
                  the Indian came with me several miles on my way, when I fell in with the squaws.
                  Now, believe it or no!"</p>
               <p>The interpreter let fall her arms, and staggering a few paces back, said:</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are right; it was Deerheel: he and Wacco are on the war-path. Go you to
                  your old quarters, and, mark you—a word, and you die!"</p>
               <p>After this threat, he hastily sought the traitor in his tent, who was anxiously
                  expecting him. Walsh stated all that Marie had told concerning her rescue from the
                  merchant. The chief was incredulous, but Walsh soon convinced him of the truth of
                  her statement, when the traitor replied:</p>
               <p>"We will take him before sunrise; I will order out a part of my band—one party
                  shall follow the base of the mountain on the west, while I will take the eastern
                  slope. Before tomorrow night, mark you—the cursed meddler dies, and I will bring
                  you his scalp. You will keep a close watch upon the minute and Lucy, while I'm
                  gone—however, as to that," he added, "I'll leave enough of my followers to keep
                  watch in that quarter."</p>
               <p>The chief gave no further time to talk, and when Walsh had returned to his tent
                  and lit his pipe, he saw warriors armed with lances, bows, and some with guns,
                  trotting through the village and assembling round Powderhorn's tent. Shortly after
                  this, two separate bands of braves left the village—one, headed by the traitor
                  himself, going to the east; the other, lead by a dashing, brave young chief,
                  galloped off toward the west.</p>
               <p>The Colonel at the Fort had received several notes from Walsh, brought in by the
                  scout-Indians, but they were most unsatisfactory. When Deerheel left the Fort on
                  the following Monday, after his private interview, it was agreed between them<pb
                     n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5694-00000058"/> that the Colonel should try and open a
                  correspondence with Hosamarea, and demand a personal interview, and Deerheel was
                  to see that the letters reached that chief. A place had been designated where the
                  scout could be found at a certain phase of the moon. Through Wacco the letters had
                  reached the chief, who had the interpreter of the tribe to translate them to the
                  secret council of ten. The Colonel promised provisions, groceries, blankets and
                  clothing in abundance, and as the winter would soon set in with rigor, he trusted
                  his offer would produce the intended effect—the liberation of the trader's
                  daughter, for he was anxious to have her returned to the Fort, as it was in part
                  through his neglect that she was made a captive. At last, after repeated failures,
                  the chief received permission of the council to confer with the Colonel in
                  person—meeting halfway between the village and the Fort to arrange terms for the
                  delivery of Marie, Lucy, and her two Mexican attendants, and the place of meeting
                  was the exact spot previously described, where Marie had been imposed upon Walsh
                  for the daughter of Carmine, the trader.</p>
               <p>The trader, Carmine, verily believed he had stood face to face with the scout's
                  ghost, and no jeerings upon the part of the Colonel and other officers, could
                  prevail upon him to think otherwise. He stood the raillery of his friends and the
                  reasoning of his wife with stoic obstinacy. The impression left upon his mind by
                  the occurrence had led him to believe that he was watched by Deerheel's spirit. He
                  never left his wife's chamber after dark, and though he attributed his seclusion
                  to fear of the injurious effects of the night air, yet he failed to deceive the
                  Colonel, who only laughed at him the more, and advised him to shut his body up in
                  his wife's band-box. He became daily more anxious for the recovery of his child,
                  and placed all his fortune at the Colonel's command to accomplish this momentous
                  object.</p>
               <p>Walsh had written that he and Marie were held as prisoners, and though Carmine
                  hoped the actress would be spared, that she might console his daughter, Lucy,
                  during her captive hours, he wished in heart that Walsh, the instrument of his
                  murderous act toward Deerheel, would never return, and that the cold pressure of
                  the stamp of death might seal up his lips in silence.</p>
               <p>It was the first new moon that the colonel and Hosamarea were to meet. On that
                  day, the Colonel, accompanied by Captain Collins and his troop of dragoons,
                  encamped upon the bank of Wolf creek—the same place where Walsh had paid the
                  money. Noon was the hour appointed for the meeting, and arranging the treaty for
                  the delivery of the women.</p>
               <p>Just here we will relate an incident as amusing as it was interesting: Some twenty
                  Comanche warriors preceded the main body-guard of the chief, and were taking a
                  survey of the encampment. Captain Collins, knowing the exactitude of the Indian in
                  keeping his appointments, when goods and provisions were the object of the treaty,
                  and being aware that the hour for the meeting had not yet arrived, and as the band
                  carried no white strip upon their lances, he became suspicious, and sallied out
                  with some twenty of his men to ascertain the object of their scrutiny. If they
                  meant battle, he wanted to be first to commence the attack; if otherwise, to learn
                  the intention of the thief. Leading part of his command, twenty in all, they
                  started for the Comanche horsemen, a quick trot soon bringing them within hailing
                  distance; but to their challenge the Indians made no response, nor did they evince
                  any hostile attempt by forming in battle-array.</p>
               <p>"Let's send the breath from the nostrils of our steeds into their faces, men;
                  trot."</p>
               <p>And the twenty dragoons, in double line, soon stood front to front with their
                  enemies; but just as they got within twenty yards of the Indian lines, the
                  Comanche warriors, as quick as thought, threw up their shields—constructed from
                  skins taken from the leads of buffalo-bulls—and shaking them high in the air; the
                  bells hung to their flames gave forth merry peals of a wild, musical jingle: then
                  bringing them down, face foremost, with a twirling motion upon the thumbs of their
                  left hands, they<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5694-00000059"/> produced such uncouth
                  and startling sounds as caused the cavalry horses to whirl round with their
                  riders, and, setting all restraint and discipline at defiance, dash
                  away—helter-skelter, in every direction, across the sandy plain, much to the
                  amusement of the Indians and the ire of the troopers.</p>
               <p>A single warrior now advanced, with his lance poised straight in air, and a strip
                  of white cloth tied near the point. At a walk, he made his way to the Colonel's
                  camp, and notified that officer that Hosamarea would soon arrive to agree upon the
                  terms of a treaty. Captain Collins and his cavalry were exceedingly mortified at
                  the amusing occurrence, productive of so much mirth upon the part of the
                  spectators and chagrin upon the part of the actors engaged.</p>
               <p>Among a number of recruits, sent to the Fort as a reinforcement, from the States,
                  there might be noticed a private, possessing a most intelligent countenance—seldom
                  at rest in its expression. At times, the serio-comic was manifested, exciting
                  humorous sensations in the beholders, and then would follow jocular glances of the
                  eyes, and a droll twirl of the mouth, such as to cause a smile or bring forth a
                  hearty laugh from all his nearest companions. The Colonel, whose quick military
                  eye, scrutinizing him with a soldier's glance of inspection, had detected these
                  humorous gifts on the part of the raw recruit, inquired something of his history
                  from the officer in charge, but that person could only reply:</p>
               <p>"He enlisted in Yew York, and I received the men at the recruiting office. I know
                  nothing of the private's history, and, as to his nationality, as little—for he
                  seems to speak all languages and to represent all nations; but he is the hardest
                  cuss on Indians, dead or alive, I ever saw—maiming their dead bodies or killing a
                  live one on the slightest offence, whenever a chance is offered."</p>
               <p>He gave his name as Gascon, and was so very polite and active that the other
                  troopers had named him Grasshopper. As the Comanche warriors drew near, a demoniac
                  fury seemed to seize him: his visage, usually most pleasant to view, assumed a
                  fiendish expression of deadly hatred, while his whole frame shook with the throes
                  of a confined and convulsed spirit within. struggling for freedom. The officer who
                  was in command of the recruits on their way to the Fort, being present, and
                  knowing Gascon's hatred of the Indian, had quickly detected the gathering and
                  swelling rage within the breast of the private, and fearing that by some overt act
                  of vengeance, he might endanger the completion of the contemplated treaty, caused
                  him to be instantly disarmed and removed to the rear.</p>
               <p>At noon, Hosamarea made his appearance, attended by three chiefs. His band of
                  warriors, numbering about fifty, were drawn up in a line some two hundred yards
                  from where the Colonel, with Captain Collins and two other officers, met them. The
                  colonel and the chief brought with them their interpreters, and after shaking
                  hands and smoking the pipe, as is usual on such occasions, the subject of the
                  meeting was discussed and terms agreed upon. It was arranged that the Colonel
                  should remain in present camp until Hosamarea should consult the council of nine
                  chiefs and lay the terms agreed upon before that august body; that within five
                  moon-nights he should hear from the council; that war should cease between them
                  during the discussion of the treaty, which was to the effect that the Comanches
                  were to deliver all the women in their possession, whether Mexican or white, and
                  no longer war against the whites, and that the Indians were to receive an ample
                  supply of winter clothing, groceries, blankets, beads and provisions. After
                  another smoking of the pipe, and treading upon the tomahawk with their moccasined
                  feet, and much shaking of hands, the chief, with his attendants, took his
                  departure.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>IT was four days after this meeting of the respective commanders
                  that Powderhorn, who had formed a junction with his <choice>
                     <sic>detatched</sic>
                     <corr>detached</corr>
                  </choice> band of braves, made his entry into the village. No sooner had he
                  alighted from his horse than Walsh presented himself to escort him from his tent,
                  and having inquired concerning the chief's unsuccessful search after the scout, he
                  thus spoke, the chief eagerly listening:</p>
               <p>"I have news for you of the greatest importance: Your jealous enemy, Hosamarea,
                  has taken advantage of your absence, and secretly, with the advice of the nine,
                  opened a treaty with the Colonel at the Fort. Two of your friends were present at
                  the interview, and no doubt will tell you all that took place. I can only say that
                  preliminaries have been arranged, and the troops will remain in their position at
                  the old camp-ground on Wolf creek. Carmine, no doubt, will be there to receive his
                  daughter. Deerheel and his tool, Wacco, have been the 'go-betweens' in this
                  negotiation. Much of the provision will be ready for delivery to-morrow, and I
                  have no doubt, from what I can gather, that Lucy, the two Mexican women and Marie
                  will be handed over to the Colonel to-morrow or next day. So we must act at once.
                  As the affair interests the whole tribe, and being for the advantage of the
                  nation, they say it must be done, and you are to be compensated."</p>
               <p>A long conference ensued, and many plans were devised. At last, one which seemed
                  more feasible than any previously suggested was decided upon, and next day at
                  early dawn it was quietly and stealthily put into execution.</p>
               <p>Powderhorn, by his liberality to a certain class of young braves, by his cunning
                  in private transactions and bravery in battle, had attached many dissolute young
                  warriors to his person, and to such an extent that Hosamarea did not deem it
                  politic to come to an open rupture with him, fearing either to risk his own
                  position as head of the nation, or to weaken his standing as the great manager and
                  father of his tribe.</p>
               <p>In distant and illimitable space, ever shine on in thy splendid, silent glory,
                  thou stars of night; glow and burn as the brilliant lamps of Heaven; nor let the
                  downy zephyrs, bearing on their silken wings incense from the forest flowers, waft
                  no sound of harsh alarm to disturb Lucy's quiet slumber—for morn, with flushed and
                  changing visage, will soon appear, and the promise of immediate release—no longer
                  to be a captive!—will startle Lucy from her dreams and thrill her heart with
                  exultant joy, and cause her very soul to leap with pleasure-throbs of blissful
                  anticipation. That time has come! for the village cock, with clarion notes, has
                  sounded forth the first welcome of the coming day. Walsh and Powderhorn Joe awaken
                  her attendants, and then Lucy is notified to make ready for instant flight to the
                  Fort and liberty. With eager haste, she arranges her dress, but on glancing round
                  the tent she discovers that many articles of clothing are missing—she has little
                  time to make inquiry. Hurriedly she is guided through the most unfrequented parts
                  of the village, until at last she finds herself upon the very road by which she
                  was brought into the town. All had observed strict silence, but now a shrill
                  whistle on the part of Powderhorn caused an answering reply, and then came the
                  tramp of horses feet, and as the dark shadows moved towards them, the chief
                  spoke:</p>
               <p>"You will ride this horse, Lucy; he is sure-footed, and your saddle is tightly
                  girded. Walsh, help her to mount."</p>
               <p>"But my poor friends! my kind, attentive Mexican friends!<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000061"/> shall they, too, not share the joy of liberty?"
                  pleadingly exclaimed Lucy.</p>
               <p>"They will follow us, and be rewarded for their kindness to you in obeying my
                  orders," replied the traitor chief.</p>
               <p>And then he whispered a few words to the two Indians who had led the horses from
                  the brush, and as they moved off with a light, quick step to do his bidding, he
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"Let us mount—you, Walsh, taking the lead and I the rear."</p>
               <p>Down the mountain's winding path Walsh led the way—the morning star sparkling with
                  dazzling brilliancy across the rugged steeps, and thus they journeyed on until
                  day, unfolding its golden wings, reflected over hill and dale—the ruddy glare of
                  an autumn sunrise. They had traveled a distance of five miles, or more, in
                  comparative starlight, and before the ninth hour of the day, ten good miles were
                  gotten over between the village and the spring at which they halted. Lucy was
                  smiling when Walsh lifted her from the saddle—her long aching heart made buoyant
                  by the thought that every step of her horse placed her nearer to her anxious and
                  grieving parents. Beside the spring they left her alone, to eat her portion of
                  dried meat and bread, and to quench her thirst from the chrystal spring. Walsh and
                  Powderhorn led the horses to a spot where the grass was still thick and green,
                  and, after staking them out to feed for an hour, they retired to a natural pool of
                  rain water in a large granite rock. Here they took out their meat and bread and
                  began their breakfast.</p>
               <p>"I told you," said Powderhorn, "that I was not the man to be cheated out of my
                  prize. What belongs to me, I have a right to do with it as I please, and ask odds
                  of no one. The council has not forbidden me to do as I please, and now no one can
                  molest me, it not being war time; and not being on the war-path, I can go where I
                  please to barter away my property. I have sworn, and I repeat it now, that I alone
                  shall use my property and dispose of it as I like; nor shall Hosamarea or any
                  other chief deprive me of my goods—be they live or dead."</p>
               <p>"How far is it to the cave where we are to hide away the girl until such time as
                  we can arrange privately with old Carmine?" inquired the interpreter.</p>
               <p>"It's on old Modoc's mountain, which the superstitious old chiefs have forbidden
                  any one to ride over. The old store-cave will serve our purpose; it will want a
                  little cleaning out, but that can be easily done. By one pretense or another, we
                  can quiet the girl, and when the Mexican women arrive, she will be more reconciled
                  under my training. The money I will have though I have known her from her
                  childhood, I swear I will kill her before any other knave shall reap the fruits of
                  my daring and valor. But what the devil ails you, and makes you start?"</p>
               <p>"Oh!" replied Walsh, starting to his feet; "I swear I saw a shadow pass behind,
                  those rocks in the bushes!"</p>
               <p>They had been talking mostly in the Spanish language.</p>
               <p>"Pooh! nonsense! your fears of that meddler, Deerheel, are never haunting your
                  mind. Some bird, jumping from a bush, made the shadow. But come, finish your meal,
                  and let's mount the girl and be off; our pace will be very slow, owing to the
                  rocky nature of the ground over which we are to travel,"</p>
               <p>If Powderhorn had been able to see through the brush a hundred yards ahead, he
                  would have beheld an Indian, slightly lame, and armed only with a bow and arrows,
                  running, with looping body, along the edge of the chaparral.</p>
               <p>After the travelers had remounted and started on their journey, Walsh requested
                  the chief to take the lead, which he did, remarking:</p>
               <p>"I say, interpreter, when you get to the infernal regions, I believe you will keep
                  constantly on the watch for that mad lover, the scout— whom old Carmine hates as
                  much as you fear."</p>
               <p>So they journeyed on, the chief in his rough, savage way, relieving the tedious
                  tramp by reciting war feats of the young braves, and his numerous hostile
                  adventures while on the war-path. The horses, or rather ponies, they were riding
                  were of a reddish-brown color, with thick manes and tails; they were short-coupled
                  and very compactly jointed, and, were it not for their sun-burnt hides, they would
                  have been styled handsome animals. They were of the thorough Indian breed, and
                  well disciplined in all the maneuvers of battle, or the dextrous angular curves of
                  buffalo-hunting. They were a hardy and serviceable breed, and remarkably fast and
                  sure-footed in getting over a<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5694-00000062"/> mountain
                  or rocky pieces of ground. Most of the journey was made in a walk, except where
                  the path presented an even surface they would strike a short, quick gallop.</p>
               <p>Powderhorn had assumed the half-Mexican, half-Indian dress. His skin was stained
                  with a copper-colored paint, a wide-rimmed <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >sombrero</foreign>, blue jacket and pants of buckskin—open from the knees,
                  fringed with braid and ornamented with silver buttons, dime pieces; around his
                  waist, he wore a red sash, from which hung his knife and revolver. He carried a
                  short-barreled rifle across his shoulder, rode without saddle, and used only a
                  slight, silken cord to control his horse. Walsh was dressed in cavalry uniform—a
                  dragoon cap upon his head, and pistol and knife hanging from his leathern belt.
                  Lucy's head passed through the cut in a richly colored serape hanging almost to
                  the ground and completely hiding her person; a short red shawl was passed round
                  her head and pinned beneath her chin.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the third day from their departure, they reached the cave on the
                  mountain plateau, where Wacco had shot the rattle-snake, so snugly ensconced
                  beside his unconscious, sleeping friend. The chief dismounted first, and quickly
                  remarked to his tool:</p>
               <p>"Walsh, some one has been here; some hunter, perhaps, driven here by stress of
                  weather. They have saved us the trouble of cleaning the cave. Now then, my pretty
                  lassie, do us the kindness to dismount; as this is only two days' ride from the
                  Fort we must remain secluded for a day or so, until the Colonel is notified, and
                  sends his troopers to guard you to your anxious mamma. We could try it ourselves,
                  but there is too much risk in it. We'll soon make you a comfortable bed of leaves,
                  and a blanket spread over these will make you a right soft couch."</p>
               <p>And so Lucy took possession of her new abode, and Walsh and the chief led off the
                  horses to stake them in the brush. The day passed off quietly and towards night
                  two Indians arrived, driving a pack-mule burdened with blankets, cooking utensils
                  and provisions, and, with them came an old squaw, carrying a pappous in a basket
                  strapped to her back. She was to do the cooking and drudgery—wait upon the chief
                  and Lucy.</p>
               <p>Powderhorn Joe composedly seated himself upon a rock, and after being most
                  pressingly solicited to sing one of his mountain drinking songs, at last
                  consented, and poured forth a volume of sound, ascending the rugged mountain's
                  lofty hight, gave back, in resounding echo notes, a noise—as Wash expressed
                  it—resembling the bellowing of an infuriated buffalo-bull as he is about engage in
                  combat with his rival in the herd; but for all the discordance apparent in the
                  traitor's notes, and extreme harshness of his voice, yet the interpreter was
                  pleased with the verses, and listened attentively, while Powderhorn exploded his
                  vocal effort upon the rocky waste of shrubs, precipices, chasms and towering
                  peaks—and thus he sang the <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Bravo!" exclaimed Walsh; "you must have taken singing lessons from your mother's
                  coffee-mill when in full blast—grinding at midnight."</p>
               <p>"Yes, young man," demurely replied the singer; "and my mother would, rapturously
                  clasping me to her breast, tell me that my heart was full of song, and that tune
                  hung all around it."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and it will stay there," rejoined Walsh; "but, at all events, I like the
                  song; tell me where you got it."</p>
               <p>"Ground it out of my mother's coffee-mill," sneeringly replied the vocalist.</p>
               <p>The night passed in quiet, and, save an occasional whoop of the ever watchful owl,
                  or a distant howl from the wolf, no sound disturbed the silence pervading the
                  mountain slope. On the following lowing morning the two Indians took their
                  departure, and in the afternoon, taking their guns with them, Powderhorn and Walsh
                  left Lucy in charge of the squaw and started out in search of game. Silently and
                  cautiously they moved along the mountain slope, obliquely, for the distance of
                  half a mile, when Powderhorn, being in front, parted some thick chaparral bushes
                  that fringed a circular space of open ground. In the center grew a solitary
                  oak-tree; at its base, screened from the rays of the noon-day sun by its low,
                  spreading branches, in a half-waking doze, lay the scout.</p>
               <p>"I have him at last!" whispered the chief, as his harsh visage lighted up with a
                  fiendish smile; "hist!" he again whispered, "I must use the knife; if I shoot,
                  that knave and fool may send an arrow or so into both of us."</p>
               <p>He pressed Walsh back with his left hand, and with his right grasped the handle of
                  his keen hunting-knife—its brightly polished blade reflecting the sun's steady
                  glare in burnished flashes of gleaming luster. He advanced on tip-toe, his knife
                  clutched in his iron grip; he neared the unsuspecting scout, when, in his
                  eagerness for the life-blood of his foeman, his foot pressed too heavily upon a
                  rotten twig; the slight, feeble snap broke the oppressive silence, and caused the
                  scout instantly to spring to his feet and seek protection behind the tree. The
                  recognition was instant and mutual.</p>
               <p>"Villain!" shouted the chief, as he advanced, "die the death of a dog!"</p>
               <p>But his enemy had quickly drawn his knife, and as the chief reached the trunk of
                  the tree and made a lunge at him, the scout dodged the blow, but received a severe
                  cut of half an inch depth in the back of the neck; so powerful was the effort of
                  Powderhorn, that his knife, passing downward, chipped off a slice full three
                  inches in length from the trunk of the tree. The traitor, however, received an
                  ugly cut in return. Infuriated to madness by their wounds, they now rushed upon
                  each other. The scout was bodily less bulky and strong, yet he was supple and
                  stoutly cast in his frame. In their struggle, each lost his knife, when they
                  clinched and fell, in a death-wrestle upon the ground—the scout underneath. The
                  efforts of both were super-human<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5694-00000064"/> human;
                  life or death hung upon the issue of the fight: no mercy! no pity! breath, blood
                  and death were pending! Either knew his fate, should the other conquer. They were
                  not equally matched, but the scout was aided by a moral courage that infused
                  bravery into his heart, and gave vigor to his muscle; the chief, on the other
                  hand, was stimulated by hatred and revenge, and his strength was wasted by the
                  very fury of his passion.</p>
               <p>Gathering his whole force and nerve the scout withdrew his body from the heavy
                  weight that pressed it to the earth, and sprung to his feet, but the chief was
                  equally active, and, before he could seize a knife, had clutched him; but this
                  time, Powderhorn was taught a wrestler's trick: by slightly twisting his body,
                  Deerheel freed himself from the traitor's grasp, and, before he could recover his
                  balance, the scout rushed upon him in a stooping position, and placing his head
                  between his antagonist's legs, summoned all his skill and almost exhausted
                  strength of nerve, bone and muscle, and hurled the chief high into the air, and so
                  violent was the fall, so stunning the concussion, that the breath was almost
                  driven from his body, and before he could regain his feet, Deerheel had recovered
                  his knife, and was in the very act of plunging it into the vitals of the traitor
                  when his quick eye detected Walsh leveling his rifle to shoot him in the back; he
                  dodged down behind the chief, but no report followed, and he saw the rifle fall
                  from the interpreter's hands, and heard a violent cry of pain. It was an arrow
                  from Wacco's bow—Wacco, who never missed his game.</p>
               <p>"Mercy!" shrieked Powderhorn ; "kill—shoot—stab the dog, Walsh!"</p>
               <p>It was too late! the scout had sent a mortal thrust home to the traitor's heart,
                  who fell backward upon the earth, and then, slowly regaining a kneeling posture,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"You have won her fairly—she is at the cave—tell Carmine I stole the money and the
                  letter"—</p>
               <p>He now breathed very hard; then came the death rattle in his throat, and, falling
                  back, his broad shoulders struck the earth, and he expired without a lingering
                  groan.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the traitor ceased to exist, when the scout, bleeding from his wounds
                  and panting for breath, was called to the interpreter's assistance by the loud and
                  prolonged cries of murder upon the part of that worthy. He was on his knees with
                  his hands clasped over the crown of his head, and striving to avert the fearful
                  calamity that threatened him: the Indian, Wacco, knife in hand, was endeavoring to
                  scalp him alive, and thus deprive him of the top of his capillary adornment. Walsh
                  was manfully and almost frantically resisting, when Deerheel interposed his person
                  between the trembling and cowardly wretch and the infuriated avenger of
                  treachery.</p>
               <p>"He is your prisoner; I am your friend! If you value my friendship, grant me his
                  person and his life, Wacco; to you I would give the world, if I had it."</p>
               <p>"He no good man; bad spirit; heap devil! <choice>
                     <sic>Ta-ke</sic>
                     <corr>take</corr>
                  </choice> him," said Wacco, his eyes gleaming with vengeance.</p>
               <p>Then looking round with his eyes of sparkling, hate, he rushed upon the yet heated
                  body of the traitor, and dextrously relieved the chief's head of its scalp, and
                  not satisfied with this act of vengeance, he sent several arrows deep into the
                  hollow chest of the traitor chief.</p>
               <p>"Spare my life! only save me from that merciless savage, and I will be your slave,
                  Deerheel! What I did was at the command of your enemy, Carmine; had I not done as
                  he told me, he would have killed me. I have tried to free his daughter! Spare my
                  life; and O, take this arrow-head from the bone in my arm!" said Walsh in a
                  couching attitude, with hands still firmly clasped upon the crown of his head.</p>
               <p>"Get up!" said the scout; "you shall live until you show me Miss Carmine. Lead the
                  way. Wacco has handed you over to me. I will deal with you as your captive shall
                  decide."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, master! I am your slave; thank you," still continued the interpreter.
                  "Only save my scalp; I know he will take it if he gets a chance. Don't leave me,
                  Master Deerheel—"</p>
               <p>But the scout cut short his pitiful prayers for mercy by grasping him by the arm
                  and, with a sudden jerk, lifted him to his feet.</p>
               <p>"Now lead me to Miss Carmine!"</p>
               <p>Not another word he spoke, as the interpreter led the way toward<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000065"/> ward the cave—his hands still pressed upon the
                  pinnacle of his cranium.</p>
               <p>We leave Wacco behind to gloat over the prostrate form of the traitor.</p>
               <p>When they came near the cave they saw no one, but the interpreter went direct to
                  the opening, and, pushing aside the blanket, disclosed Miss Carmine kneeling in
                  prayer, and the squaw crouched low in the farthest corner; the noise of the combat
                  had reached them, and in their fright the Christian had sought safety and
                  protection in prayer—the savage in concealment.</p>
               <p>"Speak to her, Walsh," said the scout; "tell her that she is free, and that
                  Powderhorn is dead."</p>
               <p>He could say no more; his heart was too full of the most oppressive emotions.</p>
               <p>"Lucy Carmine, your enemy and brutal tormenter, Powderhorn, is dead—killed by
                  Deerheel; you are now free. Will that do?" he asked, quickly turning to see if
                  Wacco was near.</p>
               <p>"Then Heaven be praised!" exclaimed the trader's daughter. "Why, this is all
                  darkness to me! Was he not carrying me to the Fort to my mother and father, Mr.
                  Walsh?"</p>
               <p>"No, no, Miss Lucy Carmine! Though you have requested me to speak to you never
                  again," said a manly voice, "yet you must pardon this intrusion. I am still
                  Richard Crampton—your friend, avenger and protector. I slew the traitor because he
                  was deceiving you and held you here as his prisoner."</p>
               <p>The neck and face of the scout were smeared with blood, and, as he spoke, he was a
                  most awful and frightful sight to behold.</p>
               <p>"Get you into the cave, Walsh," he added; "you are my prisoner.</p>
               <p>The interpreter readily obeyed the order, for he would there be free from Wacco's
                  knife.</p>
               <p>As a statue stood the trader's daughter—stupefied, yet conscious of all the
                  passing scenes before her; she was motionless, because her will had not power to
                  control her nerves.</p>
               <p>A whistle soon brought Wacco from his tragic maiming of the dead chief, and the
                  two returned to the spring, where the Indian washed the clotted blood from the
                  scout's body, and then applied some of the healing leaves known to the Indians;
                  then they sat themselves beside the clear water to recover breath and
                  strength.</p>
               <p>Deerheel tried to pacify his spirit and recover somewhat of his usual calm and
                  cautious temper of mind. He had avenged the wrong done to the trader, his wife,
                  and his child, and he had a chance now to restore Lucy to the arms of her parents,
                  and thus fulfill his promise; when he had completed this task all intercourse
                  between them would end, and he must seek some other abode to live on a life of
                  inward sorrow and disappointed love. His soul was too bold, brave and independent
                  to ask or even desire forgiveness on the part of the trader; quenching all
                  exciting thoughts upon the subject, he determined on prompt measures of
                  safety.</p>
               <p>The loud groans of the interpreter at last called Deerheel from his reveries, and,
                  hastening to the cave, he called upon him to come out. Walsh made his appearance,
                  cautiously looking round as he came toward the scout, and was ordered to follow to
                  the spring, but, seeing Wacco, the interpreter hesitated, until the scout assured
                  him of his safety, and the Indian, further to relieve his fears, gave up his knife
                  to Deerheel; so he was induced to sit down and have the arrow-head cut from his
                  arm.</p>
               <p>"Now let us go and get the horses and prepare for instant flight—but first, we
                  must bury the dead!" said the scout.</p>
               <p>The body of Powderhorn was then deposited in a deep chasm among the rocks, and
                  brush and stone thrown upon it to prevent the wolves from destroying his
                  carcass.</p>
               <p>It would be impossible to describe the conflicting emotions that wrung the heart
                  of Lucy after she learned from Walsh the base designs of the interpreter, and the
                  terrible battle fought between the two most celebrated hunters upon the Texas
                  border. Burning tears coursed down her cheeks, which, though brought forth in
                  anguish, greatly relieved her oppressed spirit; a calm succeeded the storm of
                  grief, and the jarring discord of her feelings abated in its struggle for the
                  mastery of nature. She determined to smother the expression of all feelings of
                  gratitude until she could breath it forth upon a mother's breast in the full
                  measure of her ever constant love for the man that, through dangers, strifes, and
                  numberless trials and privations, had at last rescued<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000066"/> her from a brutal captor, and would restore her to
                  the arms of her loved and grieving parents.</p>
               <p>Before night they were on their way to the Fort, taking the squaw with them, lest
                  she should escape and give the alarm, Wacco and the scout led the van on foot,
                  while Walsh, Lucy and the squaw were mounted upon the horses. They made good speed
                  before sunset, and pursued their journey until a late hour of the night. Walsh was
                  Lucy's and the squaw's sole companion, as Wacco, who took care of the horses, held
                  no conversation with them. They made Lucy a blanket bed at night—her sole
                  attendant the squaw. Wacco was ever on the watch—he seemed never to sleep, and as
                  they drew nearer the Fort, he assumed so many airs of importance, and performed
                  such a variety of antics that he might justly have been considered the chief of
                  clowns.</p>
               <p>The scout never approached Miss Carmine to converse with her. His conduct was
                  truly upon the exclusive order, and his temper amounted to sullenness. Lucy,
                  knowing his proud and sensitive nature, made no attempts either to converse or
                  obtain his nearer presence.</p>
               <p>Walsh was all attention, and acted well his part as servant.</p>
               <p>They met with no adventure or new cause of alarm on their journey, and on the
                  evening of the second day reached the Fort. When the news of rescue was announced
                  by Wacco, Lucy was received by loud shouts from the gathering garrison; Walsh
                  lifted her from the horse, but so great was the anxiety of the pressing crowd to
                  see the trader's daughter that she could not enter her father's quarters, until
                  Deerheel advanced and, taking her by the hand, led the trembling and excited girl
                  into her mother's chamber, and, as he brought her face to face with Mrs. Carmine,
                  he said, with the evidence of suppressed emotion in his voice:</p>
               <p>"Madam, I have redeemed my promise: I surrender your daughter into your hands as
                  unsullied in person, and as unchanged in her love for you as the day she was torn
                  from your arms."</p>
               <p>And when the mother and child were clasped in each other's arms, mingling tears of
                  joy in the silent and blissful ecstacy of their hearts, he left the room, desiring
                  no other reward; but, as he reached the open air, he was instantly embraced by all
                  that could get near his person, and loud huzzas rent the air that made the old
                  quarters ring with their echo.</p>
               <p>Upon inquiring for Carmine, the scout was told that he had gone to attend the
                  purchase and surrender of the women held in captivity by the Comanche chief. And
                  now let us recur to the Colonel's encampment on Wolf creek.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>CARMINE, the trader, had arrived there with the provision train.
                  During the whole night preceding the day on which the women-prisoners were to be
                  given up by the Comanche chief, the trader scarcely knew the refreshing influence
                  of sleep. He was a person difficult to read. He communicated his thoughts to no
                  one—even with his wife, upon many subjects of importance, he was charry of
                  confidence. The workings of conscience were busy in his breast upon the night in
                  question. The shade of Deerheel flitted at intervals across the mirror of his
                  mind, and often he started from his blanket and gazed fixedly around, but no sound
                  greeted his ears save the steady tramp of the vigilant sentinel; no moving object
                  passed athwart his vision, but as his eyes rested upon the spacious canopy of
                  heaven, the stars shone upon him with more than melting softness, and in the mute
                  expression of eloquent sympathy, seemed to say:</p>
               <p>"Thou art a murderer, yet we pity you because of the dark,<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000067"/> gory, sin; may the mercy that it is your duty to
                  seek be extended to you; may the all-ruling Power, in His fatherly care for erring
                  children, grant you forgiveness."</p>
               <p>Before day he fell into a slight slumber, from which he was awakened by the blast
                  of the bugle, to behold a beautiful sunrise, and receive the congratulations of
                  the Colonel and other officers upon the near approach of the hour, in which his
                  soul was to be exalted by a joyful meeting with his daughter.</p>
               <p>As the hour of noon drew near, the Indian chief was seen in the distance encamping
                  with his cavalry. Promptly to the hour he met the Colonel, and after the usual
                  ceremonies, the terms were agreed upon, and one of his braves dispatched to bring
                  forward the women. This was done with great celerity.</p>
               <p>The troopers were drawn up in a single file. Hosamarea, with his chiefs, passed
                  down the short line in review; he complimented the Colonel upon their fine
                  appearance, and then turning toward his own encampment, he waived his hand and
                  gave two very loud whoops, when the whole Indian camp seemed to be moving in a
                  circuit; three hundred Comanche warriors, in single-file, passed rapidly in
                  review—every horse apparently riderless; and then, at a signal, they wheeled near
                  to the line of dragoons and dashed past their chief with forms erect and lances
                  gleaming in the air; then, returning to their encampment, they assumed their
                  former position.</p>
               <p>At last the time care to give up the women—three in number. They were accompanied
                  by about twenty warriors on horseback. As they drew near, Carmine's heart swelled
                  with an indescribable excitement. When the captives reached the chief, he advanced
                  with them to the Colonel and said, through the Indian interpreter:</p>
               <p>"Touch thou the bodies of these your people; they are yours now, and, I trust,
                  forever."</p>
               <p>When the Colonel discovered that Lucy was not among the ransomed, he was so
                  shocked as to be utterly speechless, much less was he able to raise his arm; but
                  Hosamarea placed the, hands of the women in those of the officer.</p>
               <p>As the women passed behind the Colonel, Monsieur Gascon, the new recruit, flung
                  away his carbine, and with the utmost agility, bounded from the ranks, and,
                  seizing the foremost captive, cried out:</p>
               <p>"It is my wife—my dear, long, lost wife, Marie."</p>
               <p>And gathering the form of Marie in his arms, he ran with all possible haste, along
                  the line of troopers, shouting:</p>
               <p>"My dear friends, this is my wife! she lives! Marie! Marie! do you not know your
                  Oscar Boudoin? I am he! Ha, ha!"</p>
               <p>"Oscar!" she said; "Oscar, my dear husband! put me down, that I may look upon and
                  embrace you."</p>
               <p>And they fondly embraced in the presence of both officers and men. So affecting
                  was the scene as to bring tears to the eyes of the stoutest and hardest of the
                  troopers; men, whose iron mold of body, and seared consciences had withstood many
                  a gory scene of horror on the battle-field, were moved—some, almost to sobbing. It
                  may have been but a passing remembrance of the loved ones they had left
                  behind!</p>
               <p>The trader, too, had hastened to greet his child, but she was not present. Again
                  he looked—and with a closer scrutiny; and then he turned his face away, and giving
                  vent to one loud, agonizing cry of anguish, his tall form swayed for an instant
                  with a tottering balance, and he would have fallen to the ground had not Captain
                  Collins and the Colonel caught him in their arms. He was borne to the rear, and,
                  remedies being applied, he once more awoke to consciousness.</p>
               <p>"It serves me right, Colonel; I am justly punished: I left the scout to his fate
                  when I might have saved him. Woe is me, my wife and my child!"</p>
               <p>The Captain led him from the hearing of the troops, and bade him speak no
                  more.</p>
               <p>When Hosamarea was questioned concerning the absence of the trader's daughter, his
                  statement corresponded with the facts already in the reader's possession—except
                  that the chief knew nothing of Lucy's recapture by Deerheel.</p>
               <p>After the excitement of the day had subsided into quietude, and the watch-fires of
                  the camp gleamed afar over the distant plain, there came messengers from the
                  Fort—one a trooper, and the other an Indian. Carmine heard the bold, rough,
                  challenge of the sentinel, and the call for the officer of the guard. Sleep<pb
                     n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5694-00000068"/> had not been gracious in the
                  distribution of its favors, for the trader had endured the severest anguish of
                  mind, and within his heart, had cursed the day he was brought into existence. He
                  started to his feet, and, as he stood by the bright flame of the tent fire, Wacco,
                  suddenly presenting himself, handed him a letter:</p>
               <p>"Good for you—squaw tell me come—quick ride me with soldier—good horse blow hard
                  now—squaw sick—Deerheel no well, too."</p>
               <p>Carmine paid little attention to the words of Wacco; he was, too deeply engrossed
                  with the contents of the letter, which read as follows: <q>
                     <floatingText>
                        <body>

                              <p>God be praised! Lucy is once more restored to us. She is well, and
                                 now sits beside me praying and longing for your speedy return.
                                 Delay not; come at once, and grant to your child your fondest
                                 blessing. Wacco will present you this; it was impossible to prevent
                                 his going; as he aided in her escape, I could not refuse him. I
                                 suppose you know all about her miraculous escape by this time.</p>
                              <closer>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When the trader had mastered the contents of the letter by the fire's flickering
                  flame, he straightened up his tall form, and trembled so violently that the letter
                  slipped from his grasp, and falling into the fire was consumed. The incident was
                  not noticed by the trader, and he hurried to the Colonel's tent, holding out his
                  hand, with his thumb pressed against his forefinger; as he entered the Colonel's
                  presence, he held out his hand, as though submitting the letter for that officer's
                  inspection, and then only was he aware of what had occurred.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Carmine?" said the Colonel, warmly grasping the extended hand, "how
                  can I serve you? Pray, be seated, and allow me to offer such consolation as only a
                  true friend can bestow."</p>
               <p>"My daughter," stammered the trader, "is well and with her mother—the letter fell
                  into the fire and is destroyed."</p>
               <p>"It is a miracle, Carmine," spoke the Colonel, <choice>
                     <sic>cooly</sic>
                     <corr>coolly</corr>
                  </choice> opening a dispatch brought by the messenger—for he thought the father
                  had gone deranged—but as he glanced over the contents, he started up from his
                  camp-stool, and embraced the trader with such genuine, warm, sympathy, as seemed
                  to relieve him from the stupor into which he had fallen from the joyful news.</p>
               <p>The tidings soon spread throughout the encampment, and the troopers gathered round
                  the fires, and Wacco found his English sadly at fault in his eagerness to satisfy
                  their curiosity; and when taken to the Colonel's tent, the dragoons gathered
                  around to listen to the further statements of the Indian concerning the
                  rescue.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>TWO brilliant autumn suns have sent their cheering resplendent light
                  over hill, dale and plain, when, at the close of the second day, as the
                  heaven-painted clouds of sunset reflected their golden hue over all surrounding
                  objects near the Fort, the trader and the Colonel pass the sentry—nor tightened
                  they a rein until in front of the trader's quarters; there, Carmine flung himself
                  from his saddle, and, closely followed by his noble friend, the Colonel, he almost
                  burst open the door leading to his wife's sitting-room, and the next moment Lucy
                  was clasped to his heart, while tears of eloquent and unspeakable joy gushed from
                  the eyes of both; nor was the Colonel unmoved, for, with moistened cheek, he
                  clasped both the mother's hands in his own, and prayed that they might nevermore
                  be separated from their daughter, and that now Mrs. Carmine would speedily recover
                  her former excellent health.</p>
               <p>We pass over the affecting scene; the intense joy and blissful outpourings of
                  these happy souls. We could not do justice to the facts; suffice it to say that
                  contentment crowned the evening's auspicious close.</p>
               <p>"And now," said the wife, as she concluded the narrative of all that she knew
                  concerning Lucy's rescue, after their daughter had retired; "now, husband, what
                  say you of Crampton?"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" replied the trader, "what shall I say; how shall I act? Great God! could I
                  have been mistaken!"</p>
               <p>"All I know about it is that Wacco says when Powderhorn was dying, he said he
                  stole the money and letter."</p>
               <p>"We shall see more about it to-morrow, wife; let us be joyful now," replied the
                  trader, as he poured out a very large drink of brandy. "'Sufficient unto the day
                  is the evil thereof.' Here's to the health of all concerned."</p>
               <p>"Deerheel included," added the mother.</p>
               <p>"Wife, you always put a drop of lemon in my glass; but let it include both
                  Deerheel and Wacco, if you will."</p>
               <p>"A most deserving and grateful toast," again ejaculated the wife.</p>
               <p>"I hope Crampton will not leave before daylight; I wish to reward him and Wacco
                  with a few thousand dollars—proud devil that he is," said the trader.</p>
               <p>"He can not leave the Fort, and there is danger that he will soon leave this busy
                  life," replied the wife, while tears gathered in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Why, what's the matter now, wife?" asked Carmine.</p>
               <p>"The wound that Powderhorn gave him has been pronounced, not only serious but
                  dangerous. The surgeon declares his case a most critical one; and I thought Lucy's
                  heart would break when he told it."</p>
               <p>"Where is the girl? call her," said Carmine, again filling his glass; "this looks
                  serious; I do not wish to see his ghost again, in real earnest."</p>
               <p>Accordingly, Lucy soon appeared.</p>
               <p>"So you love Deerheel, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> Crampton?"
                  coaxingly asked the father as she approached; but all he got for answer was a
                  violent sobbing accompanied by a copious flow of tears.</p>
               <p>"Come to my heart, thou injured one!" exclaimed the father; "now answer me one
                  question: 'Do you think this lover would lie or steal?"</p>
               <p>"No! not even to save his own life!" she proudly exclaimed as she raised her firm,
                  honest face close to that of her father.</p>
               <p>"Listen," he continued; "you remember, wife, that my poor, dear sister Nell made a
                  bad match of it, and that her husband<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5694-00000070"/>
                  died a drunkard. She wrote to me for assistance—money to buy food for herself and
                  little one. I enclosed her a bank-bill sufficient to support her for a month, and
                  told her to send for more when that was gone. That letter never reached her, but
                  one was substituted, denying assistance. Shortly after this, both mother and child
                  died in want and beggary. The cruel refusal contained in the anonymous letter,
                  killed her. Wife," said he, as he dashed the tears from his eyes, "who could
                  possibly have done that wicked deed?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure it was not Richard Crampton," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Now listen again: Powderhorn Joe, as they call him, was in my employ, and was my
                  confidential clerk, and acted honestly. On the very day Crampton came to my
                  office, the letter was lying upon the office desk waiting to be mailed."</p>
               <p>"That's no evidence he substituted the forged letter," eagerly exclaimed the
                  wife.</p>
               <p>"No, but it's circumstantial evidence—— Nor, by Heaven! did he do it!" cried
                  Carmine, starting to his feet; "where's Walsh? wait a minute;" and then taking his
                  hat he hurried from the room, but soon returned with the interpreter.</p>
               <p>"Now, Walsh, tell me one thing truly. I think I heard you mention one day—and I
                  intended questioning you further upon the subject—that the greatest sin which
                  haunted Powderhorn was the sending of an anonymous letter. Now answer me
                  truthfully; I am your friend—and will protect you as hitherto."</p>
               <p>"He told me he had robbed one of your letters; that the tale about Deerheel's
                  father shooting your brother was all bosh—got up to fool me; and I used it to
                  Crampton as you told me; when I related what Powderhorn had—"</p>
               <p>"No matter about that now," interrupted the trader. "Go on."</p>
               <p>Powderhorn said if he never got the fifty thousand dollars that Deerheel would
                  never wed your daughter, because he had fixed all that—but that the act troubled
                  him more than anything else, because a poor woman was starved to death by it. He
                  often spoke to me at night about it, and I think it then preyed more upon his
                  mind."</p>
               <p>"I knew it!" said Lucy joyfully clapping her hands.</p>
               <p>"I told you so!" said Mrs. Carmine.</p>
               <p>"And it was this, I think, that made him weaken in the fight, for he said that he
                  had wronged Deerheel and stolen the letter and money," continued Walsh.</p>
               <p>"That will do, Walsh. Great God! what a wrong I have done him! How mistaken we may
                  honestly be! At the very moment he was wasting his strength and endangering his
                  life for the rescue of my child, I was plotting to destroy him; and I thought him
                  dead through my instrumentality. Should he die, then life to me will be more
                  terrible than death. I will go to him instantly, wife. O, this is a most awful
                  moment for me!"</p>
               <p>"Pray, let me go with you, father!" eagerly pleaded Lucy.</p>
               <p>"I can not say no. Go, make ready."</p>
               <p>At that moment the surgeon entered.</p>
               <p>"He's better," he whispered, as he took a seat near the mother.</p>
               <p>"You can speak, Doctor," said Carmine; "for we are just going to beg his
                  pardon."</p>
               <p>"Then go," said the surgeon; "it will rally him amazingly. I will remain until you
                  return."</p>
               <p>And they returned within the half hour.</p>
               <p>"We have made our peace with him, Doctor, and my Lucy is pledged to him as his
                  lawful wife."</p>
               <p>"Come, my daughter, and embrace me," said Mrs. Carmine.</p>
               <p>That night Carmine enjoyed tranquil sleep—a blessing unknown to him since the
                  apparition of Deerheel's supposed ghost.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WE may as well mention here the true fate of the interpreter, Walsh:
                  While perched upon a fence, watching the dealing out of beef-rations to the
                  Indians, he lost his balance, and falling backwards, struck the ground, head
                  first, instantly breaking his neck.</p>
               <p>By special request on the peat of Carmine, the Mexican women and the squaw were
                  brought to the Fort without waiting the return of the troops. As for Marie, she
                  would not leave her husband, and a week or more elapsed before the dragoons were
                  ordered back to their quarters.</p>
               <p>It was truly affecting to witness the meeting of the Mexican women with Lucy, who
                  remembered with the warmest feelings of gratitude their assiduous attentions to
                  her when in captivity. She heartily embraced them, and now she, in turn, became
                  servant, and cheerfully administered to their wants. She dressed them in her own
                  clothes; what few jewels she possessed she gave them. They invoked blessings upon
                  her head; they laughed and they sang many native Spanish or Mexican
                  ballads—accompanying them upon a guitar, which was brought from one of the
                  officer's quarters for their amusement. In fact, Lucy seemed as though she could
                  not do too much for them; but all that the restored captives requested, was to be
                  still her servants—waiting upon her person and toilet, as when a prisoner. This
                  request was readily granted, accompanied with the promise that they should be
                  restored to their own country the first safe opportunity that offered.</p>
               <p>The squaw was thunder-struck at all she saw in the Fort-particularly the big guns
                  and the dresses of the officers' wives. She expressed a strong desire to return to
                  her native home in the mountains, and, in a short, time, was sent there—a
                  pack-mule carrying the many presents which Lucy's mother had cheerfully given. So
                  eager had she been to return that she had made several ineffectual attempts at
                  escape; but when all was ready, and she saw the pack-mule brought forward, and her
                  presents securely tied thereon, she clapped her hands in glee, and went her way
                  rejoicing.</p>
               <p>When Marie returned to the Fort, with her husband, Carmine obtained his discharge.
                  Marie and her husband were provided with a room in Carmine's house; often she
                  embraced Lucy, with smiles and tears joyfully mingled; and she spent much of her
                  time with Lucy's mother, who took great delight in listening to the spirited
                  descriptions of her own feats while absent, and the curious manners and customs of
                  the Indians. There seemed no abating in either the volatile spirit of the one, or
                  the attention of the other. When Richard Crampton was married, at the Fort, to
                  Miss Lucy Carmine, she stood as one of the bridesmaids, and by her lively and gay
                  antics and acting, served greatly to enliven the marriage feast, and the ball
                  given the bride by the officers' wives. Marie and her husband accompanied Carmine
                  and his family when they returned to the States, and were furnished with ample
                  means to return to their youthful, happy home—La Belle France.</p>
               <p>Lucy took the two Mexican women with her also.</p>
               <p>Wacco was left the choice to remain at the Fort with an annual pension, or follow
                  the fortunes of Deerheel and his bride in their traveling tour through the States.
                  "Me go, you go—me stay, you stay," he said; so he followed his master and became
                  ever thereafter as one of the family.</p>
               <p>Carmine, the Trader at the Fort, left the post forever. His fortune was very
                  large, but whether he ever gave up the luxury<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC5694-00000072"/> of making money, we are unable to say. With his
                  wife, he went on a pleasure tour through Europe, but whether he ever returned to
                  the States we have been unable to ascertain.</p>

               <p>And thus, gentle reader, ends our narrative—a narrative founded entirely upon
