CHAPTER I "JUDGE NOT." STANDING on the brow of a hill, which overlooked a large stretch of undulating country, were two young girls. It was Sunday morning and rather early; -the grass was still heavy with dews and the perfume from the hawthorn hedges came up from the meadows, fill ing the morning air with a delicious odor. Close to where the girls stood there was a 'patch of blue and white violets, and they had come for the pur- pose of gathering the pretty little blossoms while yet the dew was fresh upon their leaves.  Now they were both standing in thoughtful attitudes, each holding a bunch of the gathered flowers. A pretty picture those two village girls would have made as they stood, one gazing admiringly down upon the quiet village in the valley, where the sunlight glowed upon the cottage windows and tipped the old ivy-grown church-tower with golden beauty. The other's thoughts and eyes were beyond: she was looking upon the sun- lit turrets of "West Oakland," a noble mansion rising from withbut a clump of royal oaks and stately els '  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7752-00000003"/> 4       C "JUlDGE NOT'; "OR, and she was thinking, of one of the inmates of that mansion whom she had not yet seen. Hester Powers was a pretty girl, a real rustic beauty, with bright brown ringlets, large, lustrous eyes, and brilliant complexion; her figure, too, was light and graceful. Her companion, on the contrary, could not be called pretty, only a fresh, jolly-looking country maiden, full of good nature and spirit. These girls, Hester Powers and Grace Homes, were neighbors, and had been companions from the time when they first began to walk. To the village school they had walked together; members of the same Sabbath-school class they were, and hand in hand they were going onward to that most interesting and solemn event in the history of youth, when they should dedicate them- selves to the service of God. Their parents were'of the laboring class, thrifty, and might be termed intelligent people ; industry had placed them above want, - Hester's parents particularly, for they had only her to provide for, and it was -their delight to supply their only child with all the comforts in their power. Nancy Powers was a good needle-woman, and generally found plenty of work among the rich folks around, which enabled her to provide Hester with ar-  tides of dress of a finer and more becoming character than village maidens usually wear. But pretty muslin  frocks and blue ribbons did not mar the simplicity of Hester's nature; though she was always queen of the May, the first in all the village merry-makings, she did s not lose the pretty modesty with which nature had    endowed her.   HESTSE- POWESf aIRlBOOC,      {  But we must return to her and her young friend whom we left-standing on the hill-top. "I wonder," said Hester, as she turned her eyes from the still illuminated turrets of the mansion, I wonder if they will be at church to-day." "Who?" inquired Grace. ' "I was thinking of the Falkstones," said Hester, with a blush. "I want to see Miss Isabella Falk- stone; they say she is so beautiful. Hasn't she a grand name?"' "Well, I don't know," answered Grace ; "I think my name, Grace Homes, is just as good. I don't care for big names; and more than that, Hester, something tells me that the new-comers at ' West Oakland' will not be so nice as Old Sir Richard, with all his odd ways. I wish that he had lived longer." "So do I," said Hester. "He was good to us, you know." "Yes in his. way," Grace said with a smile; "though I oftener remember him setting the dogs after us when we passed his orchards. But I wish he was at I West  Oakland  ' now, instead of the new-comers." The chimes from out the old gray-stone tower began to ring out deep, mellow tones now, and Hester and her friend walked  slowly down the hill. Children of all ages were wending their way to the Sunday school, all dressed in their very best, and many a rustic hat boasted a bright new ribbon in honor of the arrival of the new owners of West Oak- land." There was a   little stir, too, among the older folks, a  sort of happy excitement on their ruddy faces,.  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7752-00000004"/> 6    -   C; JUDGE NOT; OR, as they stood in the doorways to watch the children as they tripped along, talking of the fine ladies who would perhaps appear at church that morning. For very many years Old Sir Richard Falkstone had lived at his country-seat pretty much alone. Oc- casionally, in summer, a few visitors would come down from London, and regale themselves for a while, with the fine country air, and the rich fruits which grew plentifully in the old baronet's gardens; gladden the eyes of the country people with a sight of their fine dresses and plumes, and then disappear. But the old gentleman had been gathered to his fathers, and his rich inheritance had fallen to his next heir, Sir Huston Falkstone. "West Oakland," which had long been a gloomy place, was now thrown open; having been made ready to receive its new owners, who were by no means in- clined to live the retired life Sir Richard had. Sir Huston's family had but just arrived at their new home. He had but one child, a daughter, and it was rumored abroad that she was very beautiful. "I do want to see her," Hester again said, as she and Grace walked along to the Sunday school. "Well, I don't a bit," was the answer. "I dare say all of them are very proud, and the young lady most of all; she'll only turn up her nose at us, I'm sure." "I don't know why she should," Hester said, gravely; andCffien, Grace, Miss Falkstone may be one of those very nice young-ladies who love to be kind and good, to people beneath them. It isn't right to say too   BESTERS POWERS GIRLBOOD.      7 much about them before we have seen them.- Don't you remember our good pastor's motto, ' Judge not'?" ' That is true, Hester; you are always setting me right. Anyway, I don't think they will pass you by, Hester; nobody does. Old Sir Richard would take you into his gardens, and through the beautiful rooms of the mansion, when he would have put the dogs upon any of us if we even set our foot upon his grounds." "Sir Richard was very old and odd," Hester said,' "and when he gave me fruit I always used to share it."  "I know you did; but,- Hester, somehow I wish these fine ladies hadn't come here. I cannot join with you in wanting to see-the proud beauty." "We have no right to say she is proud, Grace; she may be more humble in God's eyes than either of us. We should not judge her; we cannot see what is in the heart."              - "We all have our own failings,-Hester; you know we have always been friends, and you know me too well to attribute what I have said to envy. I have never been jealous of the attentions you have received from rich people, even when I, who was at your side, was not thoutght of. No, dear Hester, there is nothing I love more than to hear you praised. But there is something, something almost like a pain in my heart, when I think that perhaps you and Miss, Falkstone may become friends." "We become friends!"Hester laughed. ( Miss Isabella Falkstone will not seek her friends among the -cottages of Oakland; so let your fears, and pain too, &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7752-00000005"/> 8       so JUDGE NOT; "OR, take wing. Why should the ladies at 'West Oakland' disturb us more than any of the other rich people around?" !" don't know," Grace said, as she opened the church-yard gate. The two girls quietly took their seats in their class, and in a little while all outside thoughts and feelings were forgotten. Again the chimes began, - again the music of the deep-toned bells rang forth; this time to bring the worshippers together. Old yew-trees, the willow, and the spiral cedar dotted the spacious gravre-yard, and in their shade many an ancient tomb rose from the tall, waving grass, with inscriptions wrought a century back, - ah! and beside them, -the ancient dead, the new mould, or the wreath of half-withered flowers, told another tale of one just gone. But the bells are still ringing. The soft, delicious air, fragrant with blossoms, and the bright, rejoicing sun- shine, all lent their charms to make that Sabbath morn one of joy and beauty. Groups of men and boys thronged- the avenues of the yard, and the school- children flocking from the chapel ran out to breathe the delightful air before takihg their seats in church. 'Squires, in knee-breeches and bright, yellow-topped boots, stood around in the porch, waiting until the deep roll of the organ should invite them to enter. Foot-falls are now ringing forth from the wide stone aisles, and the pews are beginning to fill. The bells have stopped ringing,- the organ ceased its roll, - the foot-falls have died away, and the words, "Rend your hearts, and not your garments, and turn   HmESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.       9 unto the Lord your God; for he is gracious and merci- ful, slow to anger and of great kindness," proceeded from the reading-desk. Hester's face was turned toward the door, for she had caught the rustling sound of dress. Her heart gave a bound, and the color crimsoned her face. The Falkstone family were coming; but, although they passed close to where she sat, Hester saw but one. Her eyes were riveted upon the lovely, delicate feat- ures of Miss Falkstone. Isabella Falkstone was indeed beautiful! No gaudy colors, no feathers, no flowers, no jewels were worn by' her. The folds of her delicately embroidered muslin seemed to float around her like misty drapery. Once- only she raised her eyes, and then they met Hester's.   &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7752-00000006"/> CHAPTER II. "WEST OAKLAND." "WEST OAKLAND " was an ancient place. The mas- sive old stone building had grown gray with age; its gables were overgrown and matted with ivy, and many a bat found a secret and secure home behind the deep' green leaf. Its old chambers and halls were panelled with cornices of heavy carved work, in which flowers and grotesque faces were strangely intermingled; an- cestral relics decorated the walls, and portraits of the ancient family of Falkstone hung in gloomy, time-worn frames to tell of generations past. A vast park extended like a sheet of vivid green around the mansion, with here and there clumps of giant trees heaping up their rich piles of foliage. It was a charming place. The solemn pomp of those groves; the pretty woodland glades, with the graceful deer trooping in silent herds across the green; the hare bounding to his covert, or the pheasant suddenly bursting upon the wing; the brook babbling along the smooth glassy lake; the sequestered pool reflecting the quivering leaf; the rustic temple, or the sylvan statue, grown green and dark with age, - all, all gave to the   HESTER POWERS GIRLHOOD       " old place an air of classic sanctity, and seemed to offer to Isabella lValkstone at once an exhaustless treasury of pleasure. Her young, fresh heart drank in the fair prospect, and, as she stood at her window, looking abroad, her face became radiant. "Bell!" a familiar, voice called her; and looking around she saw her father. Said he, looking down upon her, -he was a man of noble stature,-"Will this make you happy?" "Happy!" she repeated, clasping her hands. "It is a paradise. Life will seem like a beautiful dream here!" Sir Huston smiled. "It will have its cares, too, child," he said. "Come; shall we ride this pleasant morning?" "Thank you, thank you, papa," she said, caressingly smoothing his hand. "I should like to above all things." The next moment the girl's clear, silvery voice was heard ringing through the house. In habit and plume she soon appeared upon the terrace, and spring- ing intol her saddle, Sir Huston and his daughter galloped away, over the green. It may seem, perhaps, rather strange to our readers to'find Isabella Falkstone at sixteen, though beautiful, accomplished, aid surrounded by all the luxuries of life, preferring the retirement of the country to the gayety of the city. Her heart was fresh and joyous as that of a child. She loved nature. The trees, the birds, and flowers were her friends. Her father had himself superintended her education,  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7752-00000007"/> 12       " so JUDGE NOT;"OR, for he saw with pride that she was gifted with a mind of no common order. Not only her intellectual culture devolved upon him, but her whole moral training. Sir Huston was a man of stern truth, and just almost to a fault. The importance of truth he had most carefully inculcated in his child from infancy; she had received it into her heart, and now truth was Isabella's great characteristic; she would have scorned an empire had it been offered to her for one single lie. The rapid development and the astonishing progress she made encouraged and delighted her father, and rendered his life, which had formerly been monotonous, varied and interesting. His own faculties, aroused from a lethargy which the indolent habits of a man of wealth without occupation had induced, started with the freshness and force of an ice-bound river loosened from its thraldom. Thus the parent and child became inseparable com- panions, not only in their daily walks, but there was a companionship of thought and feeling between them. Isabella's inquiring mind had led her to look into deeper things, - those pertaining to a higher, holier ex- istence, - and she, too, was looking forward to the time when it would be her privilege to publicly consecrate herself to God's service. They were just emerging from a little copse, which brought them suddenly to the sum- mit of a- hill which commanded a view of the country around. "This is the life I shall love," said Isabella, as they stopped to look upon this enchanting picture. "Oh, how pleasant it iS;" she said, "to think that now such scenes will always be accessible to me! Slowly they   H HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     13 returned home, for at every turn new beauties pre- sented themselves. "This is far better than being shut up in London, father," Isabella said. "I think so myself," her father answered. "There is perhaps one thing you have not yet thought of, daughter; I may have to be away from you often for weeks." Isabella gave her reins a jerk, which brought her horse to a stand-still. She had not thought of being separated from her father. "It will be painful to us both, Bell; more so, because you have not provided yourself with com- panions." "You and mamma have always been so much with me that I have not found them necessary; but I am sure we shall be gloomy without you, papa." Isabella had known but very few of the sorrows of life, and she contemplated her father's absence as a great trial. She was thoughtful, as they rode on to- ward home, and for the first time in her life she wished for a companion whom she could love, and who would enjoy rambling with her through that beautiful park.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7752-00000008"/> CHAPTER III. TIE VILLAGE FESTIVAL. IT was evening; lights shone from curious lamps within,filling the richly furnished apartments of "West Oakland" with a glow of splendor. Without, upon the terrace, enjoying the tender twilight as it stole over the landscape, were Isabella and her parents. The shadows were gathering darker and darker over the woods, and the song of the nightingale or the hoot of the owl came by turns upon the ear. Many visitors had been at the Hallthat day, but one by one they had left again. It was delightful to Lady Falkstone to find herself able to enjoy so beautiful an evening undisturbed; to be alone just with her husband and daughter; for, though exceedingly fond of society, it was pleasant sometimes to feel free from its restraint. They had heard, during the day, that there was to be a village festival held, in honor of their arrival at "West Oakland," on the next day, on the village green, it was said. Isabella was very desirous of gaining all the information she could about it. "We will ride over during the morning," Sir Huston said. "   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     15 "Yes, that will be pleasant," Lady Falkstone answered. "I love to witness these rural merry-mak- ings myself." "In my boyhood I. used to love to join in such sport," said Sir Huston, " and even now the re- membrance of those bright days, the gay laughing faces, and the graceful forms of the village maidens whirling round the May-pole, seems almost to bring back my youthful feelings again." "I Will it be anything like a May-party?"Isabella asked. She had often read of those merry times, and of the dances on the village green; but she had never seen one. ' I know," she said, "if there .is .to be a  queen in the festival to-morrow, IYam sure I can guess who will be chosen " You know! How?" asked -her mother. [ "-It will be that pretty girl I saw at church on Sun- day. She was so beautiful, that I could not help look- ing at her, her eyes were so large and blue. I should love to know her," said Isabella. "' I have no doubt that she would be very happy to have you for a friend, Miss Falkstone," said Sir Huston, laughing. "You are a singular girl, Isabella," said Lady Falkstone, rather gravely. "Among the host of young ladies you have met with in your own sphere, you could find none worthy of your confidence or love. You surely would not wish to select a companion from among the cottagers' children?" "There were many I should have loved very much, mamma, of those I have known in my own rank, if our  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7752-00000009"/> 16       ( "JUDGE NOT;"OR, tastes had been congenial. Most young ladies love gayety; I do not. I might not even like the pretty village maiden, for I know I am so peculiar." "I wish you were not so much so," said Sir Huston. "In this retired place you will want friends of your own age." "Well, papa, and if I should want very much to know that pretty village girl, would there be harm, or disgrace in it?" "None in the least, my daughter. I have known many very excellent people' holding humble positions in life. Though it is not well, I think, to make friends or companions of those so far beneath us in point of birth; difficulties arise sometimes." Sir Huston and his lady went into the house, while Isabella still remained out upon the terrace quietly watching the rising moon, as it began to silver the tops of the distant wood. There were many others enjoying this pleasant evening beside the Falkstones, - Hester Powers and her friend Grace, among the rest. They were still walking up and down, outside the former's cottage garden, talking of the morrow's expected pleasures. Many of the girls were to have new dresses brought from the next town, and,for more than a week, the village dress-maker had been kept busy. Hester and Grace were both to wear pure white muslins, trimmed with green leaves. Since Sunday, Hester had not spoken of Miss Falk- stone to Grace, though she had thought very much about her, and now, as they walked together, she   '     ZHESTEX POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     17 wanted to ask Grace if she thought the Falkstones would come over to see the flower-dance; but while she was considering whether to speak of them or not, Grace said,.- "' Hester, you haven't told me so, but I know that XI Ii you expect more pleasure from seeing the fine people :ii g from 'West Oakland,' than in any of the dances. Something tells me that they will be there, and that, you are to become acquainted with the young lady." "Do you think so?" said Hester, warmly. c"I would give anything just to have her speak to me. Isn't she beautiful?" "' Yes, she is," said Grace ," but if you will take my ad- vice, you will not seek to know her. For my part, I be- lieve as father and mother do, - that people are far hap- pier and better off when they keep in their proper places." "Grace, how strangely you talk! I have no thought of trying to be a fine lady. I am very happy just as I am; but if I should be fortunate enough to have Miss Falkstone's friendship, I should not throw it away. You would not, I'm sur-e." "I did not mean to offend you, Hester," said Grace, taking her friend's hand; " don't let us part so." They kissed each other, and said '"Good-night." At daylight on the next morning men and boys were busy at their interesting task of making arches, decorated with evergreens and flowers, and in prepar- ing the flower-hoops for the children, and by and by there was most truly a lively scene upon the village green, Young girls in pure white muslins, looped with simple flowers, or festooned with leaves, and   &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7752-00000010"/> 18      "s JUDGE NOT;"OR, heads garlanded with fragrant blossoms, were ready, hoop in hand, to begin the dance, - Hester and Grace conspicuous as the chief actors in the merry scene. They were in high spirits, but as dance after dance was concluded, and time slipped by, Hester began to lose her wonted interest; her eyes travelled from group to group, from hill to dell, but the Falkstones were not to be seen. Hester strove to hide her dis- appointment from Grace, who she saw was watching her. "There are plenty here without them," said Grace, smiling, and pointing to the many handsome vehicles around, and the groups of ladies and gentlemen smil- ing and showering bunches of garden-flowers among the shouting children. But some way, Hester would be disappointed. "Is it vanity, or curiosity?"Grace asked herself, as she stood looking at Hester's-pretty face, which was half turned from her. "It is not like Hester to be vain."  Rather out of patience, Grace turned away, and joined in the dance just commencing, leaving Hester leaning against a tree. The mellow sunlight was shining through her rich and abundant curls, tipping the ends with gold; unconsciously she toyed with her flower-hoop, while her blue eyes wandered away over the beautiful landscape. She was- standing thus, when three equestrians rode over the brow of the hill at her back. The Falkstones were coming now, and Isabella, in her closely fitting habit, and small, plumed hat, looked   HEs TE Po rERs' GIRLHOOD.     19 just as lovely as she had in her beautiful embroidered muslin, -on the previous Sunday. She had caught sight of Hester leaning against the 'tree, and ex- claimed, - "There! there is the girl I saw on Sunday t Look, father " "She holding the hoop?" inquired Lady Falkstone. "She surely is not a villager's daughter?" "Yes, she is, mamma; let us ride nearer." Isabella gave her horse a sudden touch, which started him forward, and it was only when he -came near to the tree, that he wheeled around, almost in front of Hester, causing her at the moment a considera- ble fright. The hoop, fell from her hand, anfl a shower of leaves dropped around her. In a moment Sir Huston had sprung from his saddle, and picking up ' the hoop, carried it to Hester with the same courtly air and apology that he would have' offeied to a princess. The blushing girl received it with a smile and courtesy, and would have retired, had not Isabella come forward to ask some questions aboutthe children, who were still dancing, and to say how sorry she was to have destroyed the beauty of the hoop. "Oh, it does not matter now!"Hester said, ' for I have finished dancing." Lady Falkstone could not take her eyes from Hes- ter's face, and more than once she whispered to Sir - Huston, "How pretty she is!" Isabella was delighted with the children's fun, and wished from  her heart that she could have joined them.,  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7752-00000011"/> 20       L' JUDGE NOT." The country people gathered nearer and nearer, and Sir Huston stood with one arm thrown over the back of his pawing Steed, chatting pleasantly first with one and then another. All Hester's weariness and disappointment had' gone, and Grace saw, by her friend's manner and quickly changing color, that she was most truly happy; for Isabella and even Lady Falkstone were still talking with her. Grace was not jealous, but she had gotten the idea that Hester and Isabella Falkstone were destined to become friends, which intimacy would result un- pleasantly to Hester; and the more she strove to banish such a fancy, the stronger the conviction grew within her. The midday sun soon became unpleasantly warm, and the persons who had gathered as spectators began to disperse as Sir Huston mounted again, and as their horses turned from the green, a shout arose from the children, "Long live the lord and lady of ' West Oakland!'"'   CHAPTER IV.    X ISABELLA AND IRI'F,N'S WALK. IT was nearly a week after the village festival that Isabella ventured to walk beyond the park; she had frequently gone out alone, since their residence at "West Olkland," but never beyond the limits of her father's grounds. It was a delightful morning, and the air was merry with the song of birds. Isabella had been lured into one of those pretty lanes, which abound in England, too narrow fob vehicles of any kind to drive through; so the turf was delightfully green and spangled all over with buttercups and daisies. The path led to the village, and Isabella walked on and on, plucking the primroses, until she came to a pretty little, clear brook, by which she sat down. It was so pleasant to listen to the birds, and she only intended to sit there a few moments and then return home; but the way beyond looked so in- viting that she ventured still further. But by and by she had gone too far; she was close upon the village. While she was standing to think a moment of the distance between her and home, Hester came down through the village street with a bundle in her arms.   &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7752-00000012"/> 22    "r JlUDGE NOT; "OR, Isabella beckoned to her. "I have come a long distance from home," she said," and. am afraid I may miss my way going back; for I remember to have passed other lanes." "I will go back with you, Miss Falkstone," Hester said, with a blush. ' I have been to the Hall by this way often when Sir Richard lived here." "And can you go back with me now?" Hester looked down upon her bundle, and blushed deeper than before, as she said, "If you could wait just a minute; mother will be wanting this work." And she walked a few steps nearer to the' hedge, and pointed to a cottage standing on the brow of the hill,- "' That is our house." "Well, I will walk with you," Isabella said. "I should like to see your home." So they went up the hill to- gether. The girls were both slightly formed, and Isabella's dress was almost as simple as that of her companion's. A stranger could have detected no difference in their social position as they appeared then. They both wore ringlets, and their faces, equally pretty, were shaded alike by little rustic hats. "Oh, this is a sweet place!"Isabella said, as Hester opened the garden-gate of her cottage. She looked almost surprised at the repose, the order, and neatness everywhere around. The honeysuckle and jessamine. were trained together neatly over the little thatched porch, while a large rose-bush, filled with buds and flowers, stood on either side of the doorway. The double daisy look up-and-kiss-me, the daffodil, and   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.      23 wall-flower nodded their perfumed heads in the pleasant breeze. Isabella was charmed ; and to her the pretty thatched cottage, with its vines and flowers, looked almost as inviting as her own home, with its turrets and decora- tions, its conservatories and statues. Nancy Powers met the girls at the door.. She courtesied very low, and blushed too, as she invited Miss Falkstone into the cottage. Never had the thrifty housewife felt herself to be more fortunate. She had just finished cleaning up, and had fresh sanded the floor; there wasn't a thing out of place. Isabella could not help seeing how white the bed- quilt was, how neat the window-blinds, how bright the brass fender on the whitewashed hearth, and even the old fashioned candlesticks' on the mantels; and; then she saw that the work which lay upon the little deal table before the window was fine. i "Do you take in sewing?"Isabella asked. "Oh, yes, miss," answered Nancy, with a low courtesy. "I can do the finest of needle-work. I sarved apprenticeship to hit, when I were young." "And could you do some for us? I think I beard mamma say she would be glad to have some done." Again Nancy courtesied. "I should be powerful glad to sarve you, miss. I used to get just as much as I could do; but some of the gentry be gone off, and we that have our livin' to get miss their work." ' I suppose so," said Isabella, in a tender voice. l "Are there many very poor in the village?" "Not so over many, miss," replied Nancy.

"I must get papa to find them out," said Isabella, thoughtfully. "I will tell papa and mamma about it," she said, '" and I am sure they will do all they can to make the villagers happy."' The great old eight-day clock standing in the corner, with time and the world moving mysteriously on his face, struck eleven. Isabella sprang to her feet.' "I have been from home two hours. Shall we go now?" She bade Mrs. 'Powers good-morning, and she and Hester went out together. "Well, now, that's fine; that's luck sure and sartain," said Nancy, as she watched the girls going over the hill. "My 'Ester's as purty as the best of'em, and bless 'er, she'll be the making of the hull of us." She actually laughed as she sat in the window-bench and began to sew. The poor woman already fancied Hester a fine lady in a fine house, with perhaps a ser- vant to do her work. "She warn't born to be a drudge nohow," said Nancy, aloud. Looking up, she saw Grace Homes coming into the garden. "Just to think, Grace, 'Ester's gone off to the 'all with the young lady 'erself." "I saw them," Grace said, quietly, and then began to talk of something else. But Mrs. Powers was too full of what she termed Hester's good fortune, to think of anything else. "'Twill be such a 'elp to 'er, Grace, you know,-- a sort of lift in life; hit 'ill set 'er up finely." "I can't. see how," Grace said, in the same quiet   HESTER POWERS GIRLHOOD.      25 way.  "Hester's getting acquainted with rich folks won't make her rich; and even if it were to, Hester wouldn't be a bit happier than she is now in -her quiet little cottage. For my part, I wish Hester would keep to her old ways!" "Well, as for that," answered Nancy, rather sharply, " 'Ester's a good right as hanybody to better X 'erself. Who knows if she mightn't get to go up to Lonnon some time, and pick up wey somebody better to do than a country clown!"There was a pleasant little twinkle in her eye as she spoke. Grace was perfectly astonished. She did not know what to say, and as soon as she could, she went home, determining never again to say a word against Hester's becoming acquainted at "West Oakland." In the mean time Isabella and Hester had reached the park. They, like most girls, had found plenty to talk about as they walked along, and had, in reality become much interested in each other. And already Miss Falkstone felt as if she had found a friend. She was a simple-hearted, affectionate girl, without any of the foolish prejudices against poverty or humble positions. She did not care for gayety, or to live ex- clusively a fashionable life. All she desired was a companion she could love, - one who could enjoy the beautiful scenery around her home with her, - one whose tastes and fancies were congenial with her own. I Hester seemed to be just the friend she wanted, and the two girls were soon familiarly talkifg. Hester knew of many a pretty walk which Isabella was a stranger, to, and as they walked side by side through  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7752-00000014"/> 26       ' JUDGE NOT;i"OR, \"    the park, there was a sort of understanding, not in so many words, but by intuition rather, that they were to visit these pretty places together. Sir Huston and his lady were of course not a little surprised to see their daughter and the cottager's daughter already so familiar, for they were coming toward the mansion hand in hand!. -Lady Falkstone did not feel exactly pleased to see it; but Sir Huston only smiled, and said, "They seem absolutely suited to each other; she will be just the one to explore the country and botanize with Isabella." Hester felt quite nervous as she saw the gentleman coming to meet them; but when she saw that he was smiling pleasantly, she felt better, though she trembled, and blushed so deeply, that she could scarcely answer the questions he put to her about her home and parents. "O papa, you must go to the village! It is so pretty, and Hester's father has the sweetest cottage in the place," Isabella said. And then she told him how it was that she had arrived there-; about the old people whom Nancy had spoken of, and then she went to his side to ask if Hester might not come over on the next day to walk with her. IsabellaJ's requests were always granted, and Sir Huston himself told Hester that he should be glad if she would come and walk with his daughter, provided it would not interfere with her duties at home. Hester assured him that it would not in any way; that she helped her mother to sew when she had a good deal of work, but that now she had but little on hand; then with a courtesy she turned to go.   HESTER POWERS  aItLHOOD.     27 Hester walked until she got to the edge of the copse, and then she ran, - ran just as fast as she could go; she was so full of happy excitement. In Sir Richard's time she had been permitted to go into the grounds whenever she chose; every pretty shady lane, every flowery nook, she was familiar with; even the trout streams she could angle in. He, poor old gentleman, called her his little " primrose," and loved to lead her through the- half-closed, grim-looking chambers of the mansion. She thought of those days as she ran hom/e- ward, and really rejoiced to think- that even now she might have the same privileges granted to her. Never had Mrs. Powers been in such a state of de- light. "You shall put on yer best frock to-morrow, child," she said, as she smoothed a few of Hester's curls which had become a little roughened by the breeze. "Your father, now, is such a quar man, he didn't say nothin' when I told him you'd gone to the 'all long the young lady. Never a. syllable did he put out, till I said hit'ill be the makin' of the gal. Then, forsooth, he said,' Nancy taint the wisest of things to stuff a maid's mind weay big notions ;' and there's Grace Homes, too, a prating up her stuff and nonsense." "Mother," Hester said, "Miss Falkstone seems to be such a sweet girl, - not a bit proud,- that I don't think it will do me any harm. I will try not to let her friendship make me vain." "I know-- I know," said Nancy. "Don't hany- body know that 'tis a good thing for people to get such big people as them yonder, to be a speakin' and a nod- l        ., i  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7752-00000015"/> 28       JlUDGE NOT; ' OR, din' to a body? I tell you, child, them that speaks agin hit, is just a envying of you, and nothing else." Henceforward Nancy's life was one of constant study to have Hester appear to the best advantage, and by applying herself more industriously to her needle, by pinching here and there, a new dress or a fresh sup- ply of ribbons were occasionally added to Hester's stock; for it had become a regular thing for her to go to "I West Oakland" every morning. This state of things made Grace very sad at times. She fancied that Hester was forgetting that the time was drawing near when they both expected to be confirmed. Grace was a sober, sensible girl,- she was the main-stay of her little home. For whole days, while her father and mother were out to work, she took charge of the children and the cottage, acting the part of a little woman; and never failing to have order and neatness around, the children's faces washed, and their heads neatly combed by the time tired mother came home in the evening; but amidst her duties she found time to think very much about her young friend. She was the older of the two, and- thought that perhaps it would not be amiss to mention her fears to Hester. An opportunity soon presented itself; for Hester very often called in at Grace's cot- tage as she came back from "West Oakland." This evening Grace was busy mending, and the children were at play; so it was. just the time for a quiet talk. They sat together as they had often done before, and Grace mentioned- her fears. '"Don't be a bit afraid about me, dear Grace," Hes-   HESTER POWERS' GIR HOOD.     29 ter said; "I am not forgetting my religious duties; and I will tell you a secret. Miss Isabella will be con- firmed at the same time we are; and I do assure you that we have very nice talks about religion sometimes. If you knew Miss Falkstone as I do, Grace, you would love her; and Sir Huston and Lady Falkstone are sot kind to me. Mother has just as much sewing as-she can do." "Well, Hester, you' will not think hard of me for being anxious, will you? We have been such friends all our lives, you know." "Think ,hard of you! no, indeed! dear Grace. You may always say what you like to me; for we shall always be good friends. I don't forget you because I go to the Hall every day." After this little conversation Grace felt better, and was no longer afraid that Hester's thoughts would be turned from religion by her intimacy with Miss Falk- stone.  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7752-00000016"/> CHAPTER V.              I CONFIRMATION. SOME thought that it was a fine thing, indeed, for Hester Powers to be taken hold of by the gentry at the Hall. A few of the village people called her a lucky  girl, while others, less disposed to think well of the existing friendship between her and Miss'Falkstone,  talked around their cottage doors, saying" that by and by she would forget her old friends, - be too high and too proud to speak. to them." There were many who were envious of Hester's position as companion to- the I young lady-of '"West Oakland," and did not spare  unkind words. But Hester, ignorant of the way her  neighbors talked, went' on from day to day very quiet- ly.  Sometimes she would be with Isabella all day  long, walking, or examining into the mysteries of the spacious rooms of the mansioh. Often, they would spend hours together, under the shade of some noble tree, to watch the herds of deer scampering over the open ground to the groves, or in listening to the birds as they trilled forth their pretty songs; at other times,  like children, they gathered the little wild flowers, andi made wreaths of them for the necks of the greyhounds  380    ItESTER .:POW'ERS GIfLHOOD.   31 frisking at their sides. They were happy days to them both. Hester had won the esteem of Sir Huston, and ,even Lady Falkstone was glad to see Isabella so happy in her friend. Their time being fully occupied in mak- ing improvements around them, the girls necessarily were left much together. Often they were made Lady Falkstone's almoners to the neighboring poor. The aged, whose bent forms and whitened locks told that the winters were passing, rejoiced now that the hearts of the rich were disposed toward them; yes, they smiled as they sat in the chimney corners smoking their clay pipes. "Ay, the Lord bless 'em," said an old man, as he ate the savory soup sent from the Hall. "It war a good thing that Old Sir Richard's money went into gen- erous hands. Now we gets a bite of some'ot good, once in a while." Almost every day Hester's little basket contained something sent to a cottager from "West Oakland." Sometimes a garment, or a little wine, or a pot of jelly for the sick; and there were very few found now to say aught against her. On the contrary, her presence was hailed with delight, and although many praised, no one, even among those who had predicted that she would get above her station, -no one could yet see that Hes- ter had lost any of th'e simplicity she possessed before she knew Miss Falkstone. But the autumn had come, and the time was draw- :ing near for the Bishop to visit that parish, to receive into the church all wishing to make a public profession of faith. A rich October morning it was,  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7752-00000017"/> 32       "JUDGE NOT; "OR, when our three young friends, Isabella, Hester, and Grace, with many others, knelt around the chancel, and received the holy rite of confirmation.

Much as they had learned to like our heroine, it had not always been agreeable for them to answer questions, and to say that she was only a cot- tager's daughter; that sort of feeling, however, was dying out, and the bond between the girls growing    . daily stronger.

There were plenty of them everywhere.

In Sir Huston, the deserving poor found a valuable friend, but the loungers-around the tavern doors and breakers of the law met with but little clemency. He was a stern and rigid advocate of punishment; believing that through it alone vice and crime could be restrained. Poaching, which had been heretofore a common, every-day occurrence, was now hardly thought of, although all Sir Richard's traps had been removed, and those so inclined could have ven- tured into forbidden grounds without endangering their necks. The present master of-"West Oakland" was himself a famous hunter, and he thought it better to give certain young men the benefit of a day's sport with him, rather than try to keep them out of his grounds by spikes and traps. Thus he soon gained the respect and good opinion of all classes, and it was wonderful to see the improvement in the moral condi- tion of the peasantry around the village of Oakland already beginning to develop itself. Day schools were instituted for the children, and night schools for the lads and lasses who were employed through the day. Yes, and even men and women were willing to give a couple of candles and a penny a week -for the privilege of being taught to read and write.

Isabella's comfortable clothing came-in well; for the  approaching winter threatened to be severe, and as the old people and children crouched around the fires, many i a blessing was called down upon the heads of those    who had so generously supplied them with comforts. Isabella and Hester were happy. Their lives seemed to be separated from all the ills of life; both gifted with rare beauty, in the enjoyment of every temporal blessing. Was it a wonder that they were envied? *   s   CHAPTER VI. CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS. THE Christmas holidays had come.   Brisk fires  blazed in the chimney places of the cottages; ever- greens were arched over high mantel-pieces, and used to decorate curious-looking pictures of the Lion and the Unicorn, George and the Dragon, good Queen Bess, or some grim-visaged warrior. The youth of both  sexes sat around the glowing hearth-stone, looking eagerly among the red embers for the nuts placed upon them  to burst and reveal some future good  fortune. Children's thick yarn hose hung besidetigh bed- posts ready for a penny whistle or perchance a few  candies, while the keen frosty breeze rattled dry   - S branches against the windows, or whistled down the chimneys, and brought the song of the serenaders in at every open door. It was a merry Christmas-eve at "Oakland," and as old men and women sat in the chimney corners they grew merry over the prospect of a feast which they had been led to expect the master of "West Oak- land " to give them, during the holiday week.

The halls, stairways, and corridors of the mansion were handsomely lined with rare plants and flowers brought from the conservatories, and while the cottagers were enjoying themselves, in their simple way, in laughing games, and general merriment, a brilliant company were assembling in the grand draw- ing-rooms at "West Oakland." There were lords and ladies attired in the fashion of the day; diamonds, rubies, and pearls, powdered wigs, satins, and laces, i each in turn were presented to Hester's wondering eyes, as she stood in a retired corner of the hall to watch the guests as they passed under the blazing lights.- It was her custom to go home quite early in the afternoon; but this evening she had stayed to see i the fine dresses. Hester was still looking on the scene, when Isabella came toward her.         ' "Oh," she exclaimed, c" how beautiful!"!" Isabella Falkstone was indeed beautiful I Her dress s  was of pale blue, covered with costly lace, and con-   fined at the waist by a girdle of pearls. Her fair neck I and arms needed no ornament.

"You will be here in the morning?"           "Oh, yes!" answered   Hester. "How  really beautiful you look; and what a pretty ornament that   is in your hair, it sparkles so!"           s "I think it is very pretty," was Isabella's reply. -   RESTER POWERSS GIRLHOOD.      37 "Papa gave it to me this evening. I don't care for jewelry, but this I do like." They parted. One to join the festivities in the mansion, the other the Christmas merry-making in the cottage. Hester found her father waiting for her in the servants' hall, and they walked around to the front of the mansion, for the whole was illuminated, and they could plainly see the richly dressed people moving through the spacioustrooms. "Well, them who be born to enjoy the like, kin for me," said Simon.  "I be as 'appy as I keer to be, bless the Lord! Pull yer shawl around ye, child; the wind be some'ot bleak here on the 'ill.' "Yes," Hester said, " home is home to me. I am always glad to come back to our own  little cottage. See how nice it looks now, father!"  "I don't want a better," said the old man. "See how nice it looks, sure enough" -  The cottage door stood open, and the warm light from a good fire streamed out over the garden. "The neighbors, I  reckon, be in with Nancy," said Simon, as the sound of cheerful voices met their ears. Simon was right. The best room of their cottage was full; one by one they had dropped in, mostly out of curiosity, for one of the hall servants had been seen to bring a  basket to Simon Powers' cottage just before dark. It was directed to Hester, and it stood, now, just as it had been sent, upon the little deal work- table.

As she stood in the light with cheeks crimsoned by' the bracincg winds, even the neighbors were struck with her beauty.- Two Christ- mas candles were placed on the table, and the basket was opened. It contained a pretty dress and some gloves and collars, together with several other pretty gifts, suggestive of Lady Falkstone's and Isabella's affection for her. At the bottom of the basket there was a little note wishing her a Merry Christmas, and by it a pretty little broach formed from a cluster of forget-me-nots,;set in a circlet of leaves. This pin was a costly gift for Hester, and, as it was not mentioned in the note, she feared that there was some mistake about it. Might it not have dropped into the basket accidentally? She-asked herself the question while standing with her back to the company, who were ex- amining the other presents. No one had seen the pin, not even her hmother, and Hester put it in her pocket with a sort of troubled, trembling feeling. She read the note again; it was couched in the most affectionate language, and then she turned to her friends and answered their numerous questions respecting the gayety at the hall, the dress, and so forth.  Hester was glad to oblige, and interest her friends, but she was not sorry to see them, one after another, go. She wanted to'be alone with her parents; beside,   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     39 the little broach in her pocket seemed to have troubled her. "What ails thee, child?" asked Simon. "Where's thee brightness gone?" "Ay, sure Hester dear; has hanythin' 'appened to ye?" Nancy looked frightened, for the very thought of trouble coming to Hester made her grow pale. "Nothing has happened, dear mother," Hester said, quietly, " but I am puzzled. I'll tell you. One after- noon, a good while ago, Miss Falkstone was showing me some beautiful jewelry, ornaments for the hair, and waists, and wrists, and oh! such a quantity of broaches and rings, some of which were very old, and queer- looking, and had been in the Falkstone family very many years. But among the whole lot there was but one little broach that, I took a liking for. I remember telling Isabella how pretty I thought it, and to-night the same pin lay in the bottom of the basket I See, here it is!" "And because she gave it to you, arter ye war so ill-mannered to praise it, does that bother thee innocent heart?" said Simon, with a laugh. "Sure child, thee's  got the soul o' a babe yet.

The only thing that troubled me about this pin was, that I don't think Miss Falkstone's maid likes me. She seems displeased when I receive anything, and I feared that perhaps, the broach might have been dropped into the basket." "As to that," said Nancy,!" the broach ye can carry over again wey ye in the morning." "' And for a speck of woman's jealousy, ye may put that down for naught," chimed in Simon, " for women, like dogs, do a heap o' barking, but somehowi they seldom bites. Cheer up, ye timid child.

Christmas morning dawned, and merrily the old chimes rang out their joyful peals, and melrily the rosy- faced village urchins seized their woollen hose, merrily" the little red-breasts twittered on the window sills, and brightly the sun arose to usher in the anniversary of our Saviour's birth. It was a glorious morning, and Hester started early to-"West Oakland," for she was to eat her Christmas dinner at home. Grace and some few of her village friends were to dine with her. So she tripped along briskly over the frosty ground. She entered the mansion, and ascended the great stair- way without meeting with any of the family, for it was the breakfast hour at "West Oakland." Servants were passing to and fro, from room to room, but none laactly near enough to speak to her, until she was near to Isabella's apartments, then Lady Falkstone's   R3ESTER POWERS GIRLHOOD.      41 maid, making her appearance, she ascertained that the young lady was at[ breakfast. Hester stepped into the dressing-room, expecting Isabella to come very soon. How rich and charming this pretty room appeared to her, in its half-confused state! It had a south front, and the bright sunshine came in so warm and dazzling through the large bay window, which was wide open. Hester was all in a glow of heat with her walk, so she sat down in the re- cess, with her hood and cloak on, to wait, ,and revolv- ing in her mind how she should thank Isabella for her great kindness, and what she should say about the pretty forget-me-not brooch. Still hearing nothing of the young lady, she took the little note she had re- ceived the. night before from her pocket, and read it over and over, and was about to put it back, when' solme sound startled her. In her nervous excitement she crushed the note into her pocket. The color rushed to her face, for Isabella, the author of it, was close to her. Silly girl! What if Isabella had caught her reading it? But Hester was a nervous girl, -she did not take time to think.  Isabella's pleasant manner, and "Merry Christmas," soon restored her to composure, and she thanked her friend in her own peculiarly sweet way, for the gifts she had received on the evening before. "This brooch, dear Isabella, did you intend it for me? I could not wear so costly an ornament, you know." "And why not, Hester? It is but a simple forget-  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7752-00000022"/> 42       JUDGE NOT;S"OR, me-not. Yes,.I gave it to you, and you must wear it for my sake." For more than an hour afterward they talked pleas- antly together, when Isabella remembered that she had promised to join a riding party at ten o'clock. It was time for Hester to be going home, too, for twelve was their dinner time. They both rose together, and were in the- middle of the room, when Isabella said, - "Oh! I had forgotten; you admired the brilliant spray papa gave me so much, I will show it to you." Something, a foreshadowing of evil, smote upon Hes- ter's- heart. It seemed to fall back into its socket like a weight. She watched her friend go to the toilet,- she saw the look of surprise which passed over her face upon notD finding the jewel where she had left it, nor in any of her jewel-cases. "I cannot find it!"Isabella said, turning to Hes- ter, who had grown pale with nervousness. She gave the bell a pull. It was immediately answered by her maid. "Roland," she said, "' I have mislaid the spray of gems which I wore last night; will you assist me in searching for it?" " "Mislaid it! And I am sure, me lady, it was on the toilet when we went downstairs together, scarce an hour ago!"  "It cannot be lost," Hester ,said, with a trembling voice, for she felt that her situation was not a pleasant one. "' Oh, no! it cannot be lost," repeated Isabella, assuming a gay tone; but Hester could plainly see   HESTER POWERS, GIRLHOOD.      4 that it was forced; besides, she felt Roland's eyes now and then upon her, wearing not the kindest expression. The jewel was not found. Isabella said that it must be somewhere near, and after returning from her ride she should most likely find it. She .bade Hester good-by. The sunshine had gone out of Hester's heart; and, with a slow and heavy step, she Iought the most re- tired way of leaving the house. Isabella and her maid stood, as Hester had left them. Suspicion, that dark and cruel thing, had entered their hearts. They did not utter it to each other, but they read it on each other's faces. It was stamped upon them in living characters., "Roland!"Isabella said, after a painful silence, "promise me that to no one in, the whole world will you speak what you now feel. Remember that it would be an awful thing. It may be-" "Guilt be plain enough seen, miss,"-said Roland, in a sort of bitter tone; "but as 'tis your wish, I won't tell :it to a soul. Torture shouldn't wring it from me!"She gave a sigh, almost amounting to a groan, repeated in a solemn tone the passage, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked," and went on with her work. Isabella's spirits had received a severe shock; her confidence was shaken in the friend she loved, and she thought that if she, an earthly friend, was so grieved, how much more must the' Spirit of God be, -that heavenly Friend, whom she had so recently vowed to renounce the world for. ;  ^   &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7752-00000023"/> "      As JUDGE NOT;?' OR, '0 Hester,- Hester! My dearest friend! Why have you done yourself such wrong? The man of God had reason, indeed, to say, ' Defend, O Lord, this thy child, with thy heavenly grace, that she may continue taine forever!"' Isabella bowed her head and wept. The tears were still trembling on her lids when Sir Huston tapped upon the door. "In a moment, dear papa," she said, wiping her eyes and arranging her dress. The impulse was strong within her to tell him at once that she had lost the pretty gem which he had given her but the day before; but her tongue refused to utter the suspicion which was in her heart. She walked with him to the- terrace, where the party had gathered. The grooms were lead- ing up the horses, and in a little while a gay and lively party were dashing across the park. Through the shrubbery, at the back of the "West Oakland" mansion, Hester had walked slowly until she 4 had gained the top of the little hill beyond, which was a favorite spot with her. From this point, she could see the channel and the ships, and she would often stop a long time to watch them, some going up and others down; but this morning no ships, no beautiful water, attracted her. She leaned against an old dead tree, and .pressed her hands tightly upon her breast. She saw the riders as they crossed the park beyond, and among them she distinguished Isabella by her snowy plumes. "What if she, my friend, should become mine en- emy and my accuser?"Hester said aloud. "Accuser accuser!" she repeated; " could Isabella accuse me?   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     45 Could she think that I would steal? O Father!" she said, turning her white face upward, "be with me. Let thy spirit protect me from such a cruel wrong." 1No one- none but God - saw the girl as she knelt beside the old dead tree; and as she prayed, she felt that that divine Spirit would help her. There almost came a voice into her heart, "Arise, Hester, and be not afraid." And she rose up with lighter spirits. She had carried her burden to One better able to bear it than she was, - and, looking up, and smiling through her tears, she said, "By and by, Isabella will be sorry that she wronged me so, even in thought." She dipped her handkerchief in the brook and wiped her eyes, and the fresh, crisp breeze brought back the color to her cheeks. Grace, with two others of their village friends, met her as she came in sight of Oak- land, and had so many pleasant things to say, that Hes- ter very soon forgot the unpleasant occurrence at the Hall. Nancy Powers was in her glory, " making a fuss," she termed it, " over her friends'." She had cleaned until her little house almost shone; and all unknown to Hester she had bought and made her a new Christmas dress " of fine blue stuff." It was laid out upon the bed, with the prettiest of the collars that Isabella had sent; and the good woman watched for her daughter with almost a childish joy; and when Hester saw it, and thanked her mother with a kiss, Nancy said, as she looked around, II Well, gals, Christmas comes but once a year, and it does a body good to see happiness ik             * X f  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7752-00000024"/> "      ^ JUDGE NOT;  OR, then.", Her sleeves were rolled up above her elbows, and her face was very red from cooking. "Shall I help you, mother?"Hester asked, going to the little kitchen door.       * "Help, no, indeed, child.

The bright sunshine seemed to like to rest on the ends of her brown curls, and the breeze to kiss her dimpled cheek, and as she walked up the cedar   ri avenues of the church-yard, many an eye followed her; and not one of the- high-born girls who appeared in costly dress, and came in carriages emblazoned with the escutcheon of noble houses won more admiration on that Christmas morning than did our village belle, and there was more than one manly heart that beat   , with"hope as she passed them with a "Merry Christ- mas." The service was a short one, and but few lin- gered, as was the usual custom, around the church porch, for all were anxious to move homeward. IX   HESTEt POWERS' G ILHOOD.     47      ; It was a day of peculiar pleasure to the Powers farm- ily. The shadow which had crossed Hester's path in the morning had disappeared, and she, with her friends so hospitably entertained at her father's cottage, en- joyed a real merry Christmas. JOY  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7752-00000025"/> CHAPTER NM[I. THE "WEST OAKLAND "FEAST. WHATEVER were Isabella's feelings respecting the lost jewel, it is certain that she did not speak them to any one. It was gone,-but where? After seeing Hester on the next day, looking into those clear, truthful eyes, how could she suspect her? Impossible! She was angry with herself for having allowed the thought to cross her mind, and deeply grieved that Roland should have- known of -her suspicions. The woman alluded to it one evening, and Isabella took thb opportunity of trying to disabuse her mind of so foul a thought. "The gem is gone," she said, "but I am convinced that Hester knows nothing about it." Roland promised her young lady never to think of Hester as having touched it, but her promises did not uproot a conviction which had taken deep hold upon her mind. She still believed that Hester was guilty of taking the diamond spray. The wrong which Isabella felt that she had done her friend only served now to make her more tender and affectionate toward her, and although there was' much gayety at the mansion, she found- much more real 48   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     49 pleasure inl taking a stroll with Hester than in joining the party in the drawing-room. Preparations were going on briskly for the feast which was to be given to the village people on the last day of the old year. The weather was exceedingly fine, and wise people said that it would continue so for some time; the air was bracing and clear, and the ground hard and dry. Not far from the broad avenue, which formed the main entrance to the mansion, a site had been selected for the entertainment, and already the longr tables were beginning to appear. Hester and Isabella were busy planning for others' pleasures. The day- that eventful day to many in Oakland- at last came round, and at dawn groups might have been seen ready, in holyday suits, talking of what they had been led to expect had been provided for them in the shape of a good solid feast at "West Oakland." Children popped their heads out of the cottage windows and in again, to scream with joy that it was a " splendid day!"Yes, it was a glorious day; the ponds were hard-frozen, and good skaters anticipated a jolly time. From dawn all had been bustle at the mansion. Ladies, gentlemen, and servants had been hurrying to and fro, and the immense roasts, and ponderous cal- drons steaming away over fires fierce enough to broil an ox? testified to the good will of the cooks. Cold joints, brawns,- pies, and puddings; fine fat geese, ducks, and chickens slaughtered for the occasion, and which were now ready for the ovens, - showed that the feast was to be a substantial one. The great bell, from the cupola of the building, was to give the people notice ,     '     &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7752-00000026"/> 50       C JUDGE NOT;"OR,- to come from the village; and, believe me, dear reader, not ten minutes after the first sound of it had reached the people's ears, Oakland was a deserted place. In droves they came, and, as they stopped outside for the porter to open the lodge-gate, three deafening cheers arose, - "Long live Sir Huston!"Long live the noble lady!"Long live the beautiful Isabella!"The tables were soon filled, and as many as would fill them three times more waited around. The old people and the children Sir Huston took, himself, to the best places, and when he saw their grateful eyes looking up almost tearfully to his, his answer was, "'He giveth to the hungry bread, and those who trust in him shall lack no good thing!"- The guests, both ladies and gentlemen, were not lookers-on only; they found plenty to do. They were anxious that all should be well served, and were not a little amused to witness the rapid disappearance of the viands. After rendering all the service they could, - Isabella and Hester walked away to a little distance, that they might have a better view of the scene. The first table was through, and others were taking their. seats. Various games were going on, - some dancing, some skating, and others climbing poles; nor was music wanting to enliven the scene. Faces beamed with pleasure, and hearts were brimming' over with delight. Simon, good old man, as he nudged his wife to look after Hester, as she and Isabella walked away, felt that his cup of blessings was full to the brim. Some were there, who said "that Hester put on airs," and  rrrvRUU VLCIVIIiU r-U I IZLI   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     51 some, too, who said that she looked just as much a born lady as the one she was walking with; but the tongue is an unruly member; it will not be bridled; people will talk. The two girls had taken seats under the wide-spread- ing, leafless branches of an old oak. Its enormous trunk had become hollow. "What a massive thing it is! '" said Isabella. She got up, and surveyed it from its crooked and knotted roots to its topmost branches. "It was Sir Richard's pet tree," Hester said; "he has often told me that there was not another such in the country. Poor old gentleman!" she continued, " he and I have spent many hours just where we are now; he was so fond of watching the birds and squirrels. He was so odd!" she said with a merry laugh; " there was no end to his pets; he had rooks, and jays, and magpies, and pheasants, and owls, and dogs. They all knew him, and it was curious to see him feed them." They both laughed heartily. "I should like to have helped him," said Isabella. "What nest is that on the top branch?" "I don't know," Hester said; " but by and by when spring comes we shall be able to find out. The sa-me birds come back, and very often occupy their old nests. What was that?"  . -Why, only a bird!"Ishbella answered, " and it posi- tively flew from that old nest we were talking of!" "That is not strange!"Hester answered; " the old gardener can tell you that quite a number of the old domesticated birds, those half tamed by Sir Richard, live in their nests all the year round."  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7752-00000027"/> 52       "JUDGE NOT; "OR, "Poor little birdies!" said Isabella. "I must try to gain their love next summer. They find this noble old tree a real good home, I know." "'Oh! yes, that they do, and there are yet many sweet places you have not seen, dear Isabella, where the birds seem to meet just to sin ;" and then Hester told her friend of pretty little rivulets quite in the shelter of the. woods, with margins covered with the pond lily. "In such places the gray bird pours out his, richest notes." "Hester, I love to hear you talk; you have so much feeling, so much love for the beautiful things of earth," said Isabella- "How much we shall enjoy ourselves in the spring-time and summer!" They looked toward the dinner-tables, and saw that many of the people were already going home. The air was growing cooler, and the old people and children began to wish for the fires. "' How delightful it must be to be rich, and able to do so much good!"Hester said. "See how happy the -people look!" "Papa is a noble man!"Isabella said," and he remem- bers that the Scriptures say, ' As every one hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.'" They had arisen, and wre standing side by side, and, as Isabella concluded the foregoing passage, her eyes rested on the ground. Hester was looking at her, and saw that in a second her face, a second before so bright with happiness, had blanched to the hue of death! t    HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     53 "Isabella " she exclaimed, " what is it?" Without moving a muscle of her face, Isabella pointed to the ground and-there, close to Hester's feet lay the diamond spray! A moment before she had taken a handkerchief from her pocket, and was in the act of replacing it when Isabella caught sight of the gem. It was Hester's turn now to grow pale, for she felt, saw, that the suspicion, which had darkened her friend's mind once, had now returned with tenfold force. For an instant their eyes met, and then Hester almost reeled against the tree-trunk for support. - "Isabella!" "Hester!" " These were the only words spoken. What could they say! They both stood, pale and trembling, looking vacantly down upon the glittering ornament. Soon, however, the sickening faintness which had come over Hester, as she read her friend's conclusion, and felt that she might perhaps be hereafter branded as a thief, passed away, a flush kindled upon her cheek, while every limb trembled with excitement. "Isabella!" she said, fixing her dilated eyes upon her friend's, "who its it? Who can be so cruel as to do me this dreadful wrong? You, even you, my friend, you believe me guilty of crime. I see it, I read it in your looks; but there is One who knoweth the secrets of all hearts ; before him I am innocent." "Hester, be calm, be calm; I have not accused you. -Oh, believe me, I would not willingly do injustice to any one! Forgive me, Hester.

No; Hester was not cold; ---there seemed to be a scorching heat in her blood. They walked together to meet Sir Huston, who was coming toward them. ' Well," he said, " we have had a pleasant time; all have eaten enough, and carried away their pockets full. They are a merry party."  He pointed to a number of the young people fast leaving the grounds. Isabella talked to him, for she knew that Hester could not. When they reached 'the terrace, Hester said, "You will excuse my going in now, Isabella. I see father and mother looking for me."' 'Hester!"Isabella, drew her aside; " don't leave me so; come in a little while." "Oh! I cannot -- I cannot now, my heart is burst. ing-- I cannot breathe. O Isabella! to be -to be -" "Don't speak it, Hester; forgive me, for I would give everything I possess in the world to be able to solve the mystery. Tell me that you forgive me." The tears had gathered in Isabella's eyes; but no moisture came to Hester's. In hers there was a burn- ing lustre, a fixed, anguished look upon her features. '"Come! come! girls," called Sir Huston from the hall door, " you have been in the cold long enough." Hester tried to smile, tried to bid her friend a cheer- ful good-by; but she could not, for the sword had gone into her heart. "Why, bless me, bless me, child!" exclaimed Nancy, as Hester came up. "How quar you look!"   HESTER PO0WBERS' GIRLHOOD.    55 "I'm tired, mother," Hester said, quietly. Yes, poor girl, she was tired-indeed. "Tired, me bonny lassie? Be that all? Ye ha'e run too much upon the hard ground, poor lamb," her father said, as he drew her arm within his own. "Yes, father, I feel so weary, and the road home looks so long to-day." The parents looked at each other, for there was something in Hester's tone, that had sent a sort of pain to their hearts, something that had sent away all thought of the feast from their minds, and brought a careworn look upon their faces. They talked very little as they went homeward. Hester only answered their anxious questions. Poor girl! her breathing was heavy, and her heart seemed like a leaden weight in her breast., She remembered Grace. She thought of that Sabbath morning when they had stood together upon the hill-top. Oh that she had listened to her warn- ing voice! Then this cruel blow would not have fallen upon her heart; but Hester had erred then, and she was takling another false step now. She thought by keep- ing the secret of her distress -from her parents, she was saving them pain. Had she confided it to them then, much future sorrow might have been spared them all; but she did not; her lips refused to tell them so cruel a thing, - that suspicion rested upon her. Weary indeed she felt 'as she threw herself into the big chintz-covered arm-chair, in her own little chamber. She regretted then that she had ever been allured from her own humble home.  Many had said, ' No good will come of such' an  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7752-00000029"/> 56       ct 17as7^17c JUDGBE NOT; "OR) intimacy."  Had not evil already come? Hester thought so then, and in that troubled moment she, thought of the triumph it would be to those who had     predicted evil.     ^ "She be sick, bad sick, sure enough," said Simon, shaking his head sadly. "It war cold, too cold for the poor lamb, yonder, to-day. Take her a cup of yarb tea, Nancy, and tuck her hup in bed, and may be it 'ill please the- Father above to bless o ur feeble ef- forts."  And Nancy made the tea strong and sweet; but alas! it was not the medicine Hester required. She drank  it because she was desired to do so; but she did not taste it; in fact scarcely felt her mother remove her clothes, so absorbed was she in her painful thoughts. "Now go to sleep, Hester dear," said her mother, bending over the bed to kiss her. "God bless thee, darling! Father is beside hisself hif you haint nigh 'im in the hevening; so take a good rest, and to-morrow you'll be well again."  The old folks felt lonely as they sat over the evening fire. They had been blessed with but one child, and on her they had set all their affections. ' Don't be worried, father," said Nancy. c"'Tis but a cold, and besides, there's been pecks of fuss, an' high doin's yon- der, since the holidays sot hin. Don't be scared hat a shader."  - "Ah, mother, I'm afeared 'taint coild,- some'ot else, some'ot else! iHester's as lithe as wilier, and a little: cold wouldn't break her down so; her nater be hafter ,      HESTER POWERS' GIr LHOOD.     57 me own, mother.

Haint ye got a grain o' faith, woman?- Patience! I thort 'twas later." "That's only eight," said Nancy, looking up at the old clock. "It makes a heap of difference when she haint here." "Ay, that hit do," said Simon. "But my notion is there's no use in waitin' a long hour more over a few embers."  "I reckon not, too," said Nancy, rising; and, taking a candle from the mantel-piece, she lighted it, and then went into Hester's room. The mother thought that she was asleep, and as she smoothed back the beautiful hair from her brow, and imprinted a kiss upon it, the prayer went up from her heart, "God be tender to the child, and keep her out of trouble." "Ah," said Simon, who now stood by his wife, ".she be our light and brightness, and I can surely say with honest lips, that I ha'e gived her to God. ever since the poor thing was ours. Nancy, war it wise in us to let her go so much yonder to the Hall?" "Wise? now, father, what a notion! Sure it was wise. Ben't Hester henvied by a whole host, and haint it a been a good help to us?"

(' Good-night, my little one; thee father be a foolish old man. Me heart goes out of me when sickness or trouble comes to thee, child." Hester was not asleep. She had not been asleep, but she lay almost stupefied. She felt as if life had suddenly lost all its joy; her very strength had for- saken her. What if her parents and her village friends should know of the circumstance? She shuddered at the bare thought. ",I will give up my friend! yes, I will let Isabelll find a more suitable companion!" she said, sitting up in the bed. "Perhaps it would be better for us both, for I am sure that I have an enemy at ' West Oakland.' Yes, I will stay at home; perhaps learn a trade." These new ideas filled Hester's mind, and nine, ten, eleven o'clock struck. Hark! she lis- tened. It was the deep-toned knell, that solemn toll for the departing year. Deep, deep, and gloomily it boomed forth upon the night-air. Hester started up, for the sound\ seemed to come like a wail to her heart, a great voice of woe - woe. She threw aside the mus- lin curtains, and, pushing the lattice open, leaned her head upon the sill; cold as the night-wind blew, it seemed only to fan -her hot temples like a summer's breeze. The moon and stars seemed to. glitter in the blue heavens, and the silvery sheen light up the beautiful landscape. There came, too, between the tolling bell, the sound of happy voices, those watching for the New Year. "The New Year! What will it bring to me?" the girl said aloud. Until then, she had known no real /'-   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     59 trouble. The bare suspicion had crushed her. Mid- night came, and the last dismal stroke of the bell was succeeded by a wild and joyous peal, awaking up the echoes from the hills, and- sounding forth the glad tid- ings of a new-born year.  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7752-00000031"/> CHAPTER' Vill. THE,-- SNOW-STORM. "YE know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away." The dawn of the New Year broke gloomily over Oakland. The sun, which had goipe down leaving behind him a pageant of royal coloring and the promise of a bright to-morrow, arose behind sombre clouds. The fitful winds moaned through the barren trees,-and whistled hoarsely through chimneys and crevices. How quickly the scenes shift! How they change from brightness to gloom! Very pale and sad, Hester appeared on the next day. If possible, she would have hidden every trace of her trouble from her parents; but the very effort she made only served to make her suffering more visible. "Hester," said her father, as he buttoned on his over- coat before going out to his day's work, " if you be troubled, child, don't lock it up in your own bosom. Ye can al'ays come to mother or me, If ye be sick, take a piller on the settle, drink another cup o' yarb 60   BESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.      61 tea, and keep still. Nothin' better than sage or pep- permint to get the cold out o' the bones."  A cup of herb tea! Hester smiled as her father mentioned the old-time remedy, and she thought, "The Great Physician -he who bore our sorrows- he who knoweth our hearts - he alone can heal me. If he would only reveal to Isabella who took that jewel!!" "Come now; lassie," said the old man, "'don't take the sunshine from the 'arthstone. We have none but you, Hester. Come, be bright, for He knows," -- and the old man looked revrerently upward, --, yes, he knows that all, our joy is in your merry laugh." He pressed her hand lightly upon his breast, and played tenderly with her curls. Again Hester felt that it would be better to tell her father what had hap- pened; but instantly came the thought, "Why should I grieve him?" Simon Powers was as proud of his honest ancestry as if they had been nobles born. ' A good name is better than riches," he often repeated, and Hester felt sure that he would not rest until she was made clear of the charge. Thus she reasoned. If her father looked into the matter, many might hear of it, and make the affair even worse than it looked now. If it was let alone, it would quietly die out. She therefore concluded that in future it would be her wis- est course' to stay more at home, and in the spring to a go and learn the dress-making. Having fully decided upon this, she became more cheerful, and really felt better. She aided her mother in all the little domestic duties, for she knew that to be busily employed was  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7752-00000032"/> 62       "JUDGE NOT; "OR, the best way to divert one's thoughts from trouble. After the morning's work was done up, the best room carefully dusted, and a bright fire crackling pleasantly away in the large chimney-place, Hester ran out into the garden and gathered the last few chrysanthemums, which were being cruelly blown about by the keen wind, a few sprigs of box, and a little everlasting. She arranged them in -a cup and set it upon the little deal table beside the work-basket. They really looked pretty, and the whole room comfortable and attractive. They both sat down to sew, each wishing that " father " could have stayed at home that gloomy day. "If I'm crooked and ungrateful other times," said Nancy, as she looked from the window, '" these sort of days al'ays makes me thankful; we've got a home, anyhow." "That we have, mother, and as nice a one as I want," said Hester. "I haint a thort of complaining. of it for meself, child, -not I, -but sometimes I do wish for a better one for you. I may be sinful, perhaps, but it's me love, child,-me love." "Mother," Hester said, quietly, "I sometimes have wished for better things myself; but now I am sure  that it is best for every one to be contented in the position he was placed by Providence., I wish I had gone to a trade, like Grace." "Why, child, what's come over you? Learn a trade and be a sewin'. from morning till night, when you can be a lady, and live like one, a pleasuring all day long?   HESTER POWERS' GIRSzwOOD.     63 Why, I be amazed, confounded, frightened,--sure I am the three, I am!" "But, mother, I can't always live so. Suppose you or father should be taken away from me; I shouldn't be able to lead an idle life then. I am nearly seven- teen-" "Hush, child! a body might think your senses had left ye. Would you give up sich friends as you have yonder, just when the whole place be a talking and envying of you-tut, tut." "It may not be the best thing for me in the end, 'mother.

She had taken her corner in the- window-bench, and, looking out, saw that the snow-flakes were beginning to fall' from the leaden sky. Nancy declared that it was delightful to be in a "warm room, and have a body's hands full of good, fine work, such weather." She plied her needle dili- gently, and hummed tunes between times; but'Hester's   &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7752-00000033"/> "   @   ' JUDGE NOT; "OR,' work lay in her lap; she thought and watched the snow by turns. It is said that " every human body has a certain des- tiny allotted to him; that it is not in his power to es- cape it: go this way or that, he has the same end to attain, the same good or evil to encounter." Be this so or not we cannot say. If our " times be in his hands," let us say "It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good." Hester accomplished very little that day; her nerves were unstrung; one minute she felt hot and feverish, the next cold; every sound made her starts. As the clay advanced, the snow fell faster, and when Simon came in from work he said that it would be a, big storm, and that the people, many of them, had neither food nor fuel laid up in case it should be a heavy fall. Grace Homes and 'her mother ran over just a minute to say something about the same thing, and to ask after Hester, who they had heard was not well., The two girls were soon together in the window- bench, while the three old people sat over the fire. "What made you sick, Hester? you are so pale!"  Grace took her friend's hand and looked earnestly into her eyes. "I'm only not very well, Grace," Hester said, look- ing down; and then they neither spoke for a while. "Hester!"Grace said, at length,  I can't help thinking. You know that I don't believe in dreams, or omens, as granny says; but I have dreamed so much about you lately that I can't help thinking there must   * ,                      H - ESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     65 be something in it. It hangs over me, and I feel troubled." Hester looked paler than before, though she tried to speak lightly, -tried to smile. Her friend's words had carried additional weight to her heart. "I am not well, Grace," she said, sadly, while the moisture glis- tened in her eye. 'c I am tired; so tired and weary, I want to rest." She paused for a moment, and then said, "(I could not expect to live in the world without trouble. If it comes to me, I must bear it patiently as others do." Grace looked at her. "Hester," she said, " no one has told me so, but I am sure that something has hap- pened to you." Hester started. Her eyes-looked full of alarm. They sat looking at each other. "Come, come, Grace!" called Mrs. Homes from the settle. "We must be off, for just look at the snow. Dear bless me!" she continued, " there'll be many among us nigh perishing before it's over. Dear, dear!" "Trust in the Lord," said Simon, shaking his white head. "Trust him; he be a present help in time o' trouble." Faster, faster it came down, in driving sheets, for a high wind prevailed, and the snow soon began to lie in heavy drifts, blocking up highways, and threatening to close up many of the cottages altogether. Sir Huston and Lady Falkstone, as they sat in their mansion surrounded by all the luxuries of life, were not unmindful of those whom they knew must be already suffering.

Pictures of shivering, hungry chil- dren, and old people huddling together over a few em- bers, depressed their generous hearts; and it was with grateful feelings that they realized on the second morn- ing that the storm had ceased ; and after having partaken of a hasty breakfast, Sir Huston started off, wading to his boot-tops in the snow. "What a dismal prospect!"Isabella thought, as she watched him going down the avenue. She wished very much, then, that Hester was with her, and re- gretted, with pain, that it had not been in her power to hide her feelings when she caught sight of the diamond spray at Hester's feet. What to think of the matter she hardly knew. It was certainly clothed in mystery. She had not failed to tell Roland that it was found, and to mention again the regret she felt that they had ever cast a shadow of doubt upon Hes- ter. But as was Roland's habit on such' occasions, sho smiled, and with' a slight toss of her head, said, " 'Tis as well to let the shoe be worn by the foot it was made 'for, my young lady.

Mrs. Grieves was Lady Falkstone's attend- ant. "Grieves, " she said, going quietly in and closing the door behind her, "Grieves, it is found!" "Found!"  The tall, spare, gray-eyed Grieves started to her feet, placed her hands upon her hips and repeated the query again, "Found?" "Put back, no doubt," said Roland with a sneer. "' She's deep,- deep, I say." The two women sat down over the fire with heads too close together for good. They had an unfortunate- ly pretty girl in their claws, and were determined to let envy do its work. Hester was not handled very daintily by them that morning. "We'll watch her close enough after-this," said Roland. "Of course! It is our Christian duty, my dear," said Mrs. Grieves. "We have our own characters to take care of, haint we?" The neck was elongated ,again and the forefinger going rapidly. "Don't I know Sir Huston?  I reckon I do. And, mark me, there'd be a stir if the affair got to his hears." tc That there would," said Roland. "Now, my dear, look you," said Grieves. "Could a thing be easier than for that low girl to ruin uss? For, mark me, let a suspicion once pop into the mas- ter's head - why, good-by to you. If his only child, Miss Isabella, was to commit a crime, he wouldn't raise his finger to save her from the law."    - "That's what I think, too," said Roland.

"Oh, don't be afeard of me, my dear! Haint I has tight has beeswax?" Grieves's gray eyes twinkled. They smiled at each other, those two women did, for they, like a pair of vul- tures, were eager to devour completely their prey. With Grieves particularly this affair was an event, which suited her taste. It was marrow to her bones, and health to her flesh, to be,in the midst of scandal. She smiled and groaned alternately, and drew frightful com- parisons between her own and her victim's character. She loved to hint things and exclaim over the frailties of her kind, ever winding up with thankfulness to Heaven that she was so-and-so! On this morning, while Sir Huston was looking into the condition of things outside, these two women were sitting over a comfortable fire, comforting the inner man with a substantial draught of mulled ale, and necessarily growing animated as they discussed Hes- ter's character. Poor child! she had not a virtue in their estimation. ' Now," said Grieves, " since I was so high," mark- ing a certain height with her hand, "I've read books,- ay, hundreds of 'em,-and of course I've become a real good judge of character.

There's my young lady's bell!"Ro- land stopped only a second, just to enjoin secrecy, and was off. Isabella was at her writing-desk when her maid en- tered. "Rolahnd," she said, " papa has just come in, and, I think, intends sending some of the men to the village to look after the people. Take this note to him, and say I should be glad if he would have it taken to the Powers cottage." Roland received it, courtesied, and was gone. Over and over she turned it, and to the light she held it. In fact, it was handled by both Grieves' and herself, and duly commented upon before it was taken to the library, where Sir Huston and his lady were. The gentleman, having but just come in, was still covered with snow. "Tell Miss Isabella that I am going to the village, and will deliver it myself," Sir Huston said. And in a little while, he, with several men, started off through the snow-drifts. The wind was still high and biting, and the roar of the billows on the rocky coast came like a mighty moan over common, and hill. It was quite an undertaking to wade three-llnarters of a mile in such snow, but "Where there is a will, there is a way," is an old but true saying. There was much need of assistance, and Sir Huston and his men found plenty to do. Measures were at once taken to supply the needful, as far as he could, at once, and then promised to see that more should be done later in the day. Ah! who in Oakland did not bless him,   .                  .    ."  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7752-00000036"/> 70      "JUDGE NOT;"' OR,  and thank God for having disposed his noble heart toward them? Who in Oakland, young or old, could remember a time when Sir Richard had looked into their cottages so, and inquired about their wants? Alas, none! "'Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only,'" repeated an old woman, as Sir Huston was turning to go. "And we read, too, 'He that giveth to the poor shall not lack.' The Lord bless thee! The Lord bless thee, sir!" Sir Huston turned away with a full heart and bent his steps toward the Powers cottage.  His loud knock upon the door startled both Hester and her mother. Nancy was toasting out a "kink in her neck" on her knees before the fire; so it fell to Hes- ter's lot to go to the door. Poor child! she almost shuddered as she saw his tall form in the porch. "  Ah This is cold indeed, Hester," he said, enter- ing, and striding across to the fireplace. For the time being, Nancy had no more "kink." She was up on her feet, and courtesying at every word. "Was ever'such an honor paid to a Powers before? The gentleman had absolutely taken a seat in ' Simon's own chair,' and was looking about him as if he owned the place." Nancy fairly burst out into a laugh. Hester had gone to her seat on the window-bench, and every now and then she ventured to look up; but every time she saw Sir Huston's great hazel eyes look- ing at her. "What is the matter, Hester?" he inquired, at length.   HESTER POWERSX GIRLHOOD.      71 "As to that, sir," said Nancy, " 'tis 'ard to say what does -ail the child; she hae' been droopy ever since the feast-day." "Took cold, perhaps.

Her face was turned upward, and a happy, bright- ex- pression-her old look - shone from her eye. "You are a good girl, Hester," he said. "Isabella is wishing for you very much." ' I will come the first fine day, - the very. first," she said, going to the door with him. Isabella's note was full of kindness and affection. There was no mention in it of the unpleasant cir- cumstance of the jewel. The pain, the suspense, the terrible nameless dread, which had been oppressing her heart so long, passed away; and she now-only thought of her friend. She felt sure that Isabella was unhappy, knowing that she had caused her so much suffering. All the wrong was forgotten, and the impulsive, tender- hearted girl longed to kiss the hand which had dealt the cruel blow. The trade, alas! it was forgotten, and Hester looked anxiously to the time when she and Isabella Falkstone should meet again. /   &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7752-00000037"/> 'CHAPTER IX.       , THE GIPSY'S PROPHECY. JANUARY was past. Trhe snow-drifts melted away, and again a delightful season of fair weather had set in; not too cold, but clear, bracing, and delightful. The guests so long housed up, first by the falling snow, then by the drifts, and afterward by the melting of the snow, were indeed glad to be able to exercise themselves in the open air. Occasionally the hunter's bugle might be heard, and the sportsmen, in brilliant uniform of scarlet or orange, seen dashing over ledges and ditches preceded, by their packs of yelping hounds. These brilliant and stirring scenes never failed to excite the beholder: the hunted victim being almost always forgotten; the graceful, and flying horses, their plumed riders, and the eager, and crying pack alone attracting attention and arousing en- thusiasm. It was a beautiful morning, and Isabella and Hester -whose love seemed to have become more tender, whose friendship had strengthened under trial -were walking up and down the broad terrace. They were both painfully interested in the same scene. A poor "   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.      73 hunted fox, panting and terrified, had leaped over into the park, baffling, for a moment, his pursuers. The girls' hearts went out for the fox. They watched him with the most intense anxiety, while almost a prayer escaped their lips for his safety. "Fly faster! fly faster, poor fox!" they cried, as the blast from the horns sounded and- the intensely eager dogs caught another sight of him. "Oh, fly! fly! But onward flew the hounds followed by the no less eager horsemen. The girls' hands were clasped and their eyes were strained after the poor victim, whose fevered tongue hung friom his foamy moutli. "Oh! see, see, they are gaining! they are gaining! poor fox! poor fox! Oh! why will they hunt him to death?" cried Hester. "There! there!" One more blast from the bugles, one shout from the hunters. The fox was caught! poor bleeding victim,! The girls cried, cried bitter tears as they turned baway. Oh, what -a mystery it is to-me!" said Isabella. W"Why are those who have power so cruel?" Hester looked at leer. "Alas! why?" she thought; "'tis strange." She was thinking of the wrong which she had herself passed through. "Yes, it is strange!"Isabella repeated. "What were you thinking, Heester?" "Only how true it is that the strong will persecute the weak. I shall never forget the fox. What anguish he must have felt, poor thing!" Isabella felt badly. She knew how much suffering she had caused her friend. Yet while she thought this,  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7752-00000038"/> 74       JUDGE NOT;"OR, again the feeling came strongly within her that Hester was responsible for the disappearance and the re- appearance of the jewel. -Her face became grave, and Hester could not help thinking that her friend still be- lieved her guilty. They continued to walk up and down on the terrace, Lbut silently. Roland, ever busy prying into matters. concerning the two girls, had caught a word or two here and there in their conversation, such as- persecute - -weak-- wrong- and so forth, on which she put her own con- struction. "Well, well," she said, "'taint done with yet. Mr. Rubens," - she spoke to the butler who happened to be passing, " look you, Mr. nubens ; just look at the hairs!" Mr. Rubens had been let into the secret of Hester's (" wrong doings." "Hairs! I don't see 'em, Mrs. Roland; the gal be a walking jist hup hand down like hany other decent lady." "Not see 'emn!"Mrs. Roland answered, in surprise. "Where's the difference between riy young lady and 'er hin pint of dress? Haint that hairs?" "Dress!

W' Well, Mr. Rubens, hif you ben't a strange man, after Awe reckoned upon your friendship! The next thing we- may expect will be orders to find other situations." Mrs. Roland applied the corner of her apron to one eye. 'A busybody I ben't, mum!" said Mr. Rubens, " nor does I hever stir in hobnoxious pools. Hall I should say, mum, is this: hit haint our places, nor a wise thing to pick to -pieces a poor young woman's character. Hif she do wrong, and, has you say, do steal, why, there's a law in the land, and a God above to judge her justly." Isabella and Hester just then came in and passed up the large stairway, startling Mrs. Roland almost out of her senses. "Could they have, heard?" she asked, eagerly. 1No! happy indeed was it for our heroine to be ignorant that prying eyes and curious ears and cruel - and jealous hearts were around her, watching, listening,      and turning into evil her .very looks. The serpent was hidden, and Hester only saw the flowery thicket in which he lurked. So she went on from day to day,  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7752-00000039"/> 76       "JUDGE NOT; "OR, fearing no evil. Like a sunbeam she carried light and warmth and love into her frienld's domestic circle. Sir Huston and Lady Falkstone became every day more tenderly attached to her. They saw and admired her consistent piety, and marked those modest, retiring traits which are so beautiful in woman., Although Hester was familiar with them, rode and Nwalked, and sometimes sat at meat with them, they could observe no obtrusiveness.' She took no undue advantage of their kindness, and many said that by and by she would be equal with Isabella in the love of Sir Huston and his wife. It had become a custom with Hester to leave "West Oakland" at least an hour before sundown every evening. Tlhere were two ways direct to the village; - one by the main, or turnpike road; the other a nearer route, by skirting the copse, and going through several pretty little grassy lanes. This latter way Hester had named her summer path. It was so shady, so quiet then, and filled with such a variety of pretty flowers, and no end to the birds. They sang all day long undisturbed, particularly the gray bird which was. Hester's favorite among all the little songsters. The weather now was peculiarly delightful for Feb- ruary; and as Hester bade her friends good-by one evening, she walked away in the direction of the sum- mer path. She had heard the birds ; the peacocks, too, were rejoicing in the pleasant sunshine, plumning their gorgeous trains; the young fawns, the stag, and the pretty timid doe frolicked and scampered across the open grounds. She could not help standing to watch   ;11 ,1 ,.                         L HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.      " them, taking no heed of- time. The grass was fresh and green in the lanes, -and here again, she stopped to look for the appearance of bud or flower. One only she found, -just one little violet bud, and she pinned it upon her bosom. She had not noticed that the shades of evening were gathering around her; but they were. It was growing dark, and she wfs still quite half the way from homd. She had entirely forgotten that an encampment of gipsies was just on the lower border of the copse through which her path lay, and not until she had emerged from the lane and come almost upon them did she think of it. The sight of the weird creatures around the evening fires, the dancing groups of young men and women, the feeding donkeys, and the wretched-looking piles heaped together, made Hes- ter stop, and lift up her hands, while a sort of blank, uncertain look was visible on her features. Her first, impulse was to go back; the second to run past the encampment as fast as she could; but before she had time to determine what to do, one of the old creat- ures came towarl her. The woman's bronzed face, deep-set eyes, and crisp locks, short red gown, and feet encased in blue woollen hose, all inspired Hester with -fear. She stood still, looking at her as she came for- ward. "Shall I tell! you a bit of luck to-day my purty one?" began the creature, rubbing her hands together and smiling. "Oh! no, I thank you," Hester said, nervously. "I have been loitering by the way and am very late.

She moved off sideways, for she saw that others of the tribe were coming near them, "-And couldn't ye spare the bauble at the throat, young lady?" asked the hag. "Oh! no!" said Hester, alarmed at the thought of losing her forget-me-not pin. "I could not spare that. Please don't detain me." "Don't be frightened. I will not harm thee. But, for thy purty eyes and curls, the old mother will give thee just a little. Now open your hand, and let me see the palm just a minute." "There!" said Hester, in a tone half-crying, half- laughing, as she pulled off her glove, " tell me quick, mother." The hag looked only a second at the blushing palm, and then raising her keen, black eyes to Hester's, said with a solemn shake of the head, "Ye were born under an unlucky star, pore child." "Oh, let me go now! Don't you see how dark it is growing?"Hester said, in a frightened tone. But the hag continued: I' The hounds have scented the young doe's blood; better the purty creatur' had kept to his own thicket, than have been tempted out into the king's forest. Ye can turn back yet, me purty one, and baffle the foe if ye woll! Farewell!"With a wave of her brawny hand, the gipsy followed her clan back to the fires.   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.      79 -Hester shuddered,--ran,- ran as fast as her feet could go over the ground. ' What did she mean, I wonder?" she thought. "Could she mean me?  Oh, I wonder if-- but wise people laugh at what gipsies-say, so I will put it out of my thoughts." The stars were now twinkling brightly in the sky, and a sort of weird light shone over her shoulder. She looked around, half expecting that the tribe of gipsies were after her; but it was only the old moon, rising solemnly up from behind the woods. Grace was look- ing out for her at her own cottage door. "I have been watching for you for more than an hour," she said; "and, Hester, what made you come by the lanes, when you knew that the gipsies were in the woods?" "My thoughts were on other things, Grace, and' I did not remember that they were there until I came upon them." And then she repeated to her friend all that the gipsy had said. Grace looked grave. "Hester," she said, as'they came to the latter's garden-gate, "I haven't a bit of superstition in me; but, some way, I am troubled,-- things don't look right. I wish with all my soul you would quit ' West Oakland,' and come back to your old ways. I have always felt that a time will come when you will be sorry for not having followed your friend's advice." "Grace, dear," said Hester, tenderly, " there was a time when I desired very much to follow your example, and learn a trade; but mother thought it would be so terrible to throw away such friends as.

"Well," said Grace. '"Don't go! said Hester. "Come in and sit awhile." The best room- was a cosey, cheerful little place, and it was Hester's chief enjoyment to sit in the evening between her father and mother, and relate the events of the day. To-night she had plenty to tell them, about the poor fox, and her meeting with the gipsies, and other things. Grace was one of the listeners this evening, and when Hester had concluded, she said, ' I can't help thinking, Hester, how much you have learned; you talk so well. I don't believe you were born under an unlucky star." "Tut, tut, Grace," said Nancy Powers, 'nobody call say that o' 'Ester, sure; but I s'pose hif a hangel should come down here 'e'd ha'e his failings in the hies o' mortals.

Grace said good-night, and then the little family en- gaged in their usual devotions, and retired.   CHAPTER X. THE PORTRAIT-PAINTER. FOR a long time it had been a pet plan with Sir Hus- ton to take his family to London early that spring. He wished to add their portraits, with his own, to the long line of ancestral paintings which hung upon the walls in the gallery of the "' West Oakland " mansion. Quaint and faded faces looked out from darkened, time- worn frames, speaking to the living of centuries past, ' of generations gone to mingle with the dust. "Papa," said Isabella, as they walked together through the grand and sombre-looking galleries, ex- amining pictures of people and fashions of days gone by, "I wish you could defer this plan of yours a little longer, I have so set my heart upon remaining here all through this spring. Hester and I have promised our- selves so much enjoyment." She looked up into his face almost pleadingly. Sir Huston smiled, and patted her cheek. "Well," he said, " let me hear what you think of this." He took a letter from his pocket, and, taking her hand, led her to the recess of one of the large windows. "I have just received it from our old friend Lord Grumby, 1 &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7752-00000042"/> 82       AdC JUIDGE NOT;"OR, in answer to one I wrote to him, but a short time since, on the subject of the portraits. Now you see he recommends as the artist, a young man of genius and great talent, but who is as yet comparatively unknown to the world. 'He needs,' says Grumby, 'but the patronage of some one as well known as yourself to give him a start. He is in poor health.' Now^ said Sir Huston, as he folded the letter, "' I did think some- thing of adopting this plan. Let the young man come down here, and, perhaps among our pleasant hills, where he will be near enough to breathe the sea-breeze, he might be fortunate enough to regain his health. What say you?" "Let him come by all means!"Isabella said. "Poor young man! It will be such a pleasant change for him, and save us from going to the disagreeable city. It would be such a disappointment to leave all the flowers and fruits behind." '"And you really prefer to risk these portraits in this unknown artist's hands, rather than go to London and have them painted by some one who has made himself a name?" "' Yes, papa, I do." "And I, too," said Lady Falkstone, just coming in. "Lord Grumby is a cautious man, and would not have recommended this gentleman without having good reason to think him competent to undertake the work. Let him come down to ' West Oakland.'" ' Oh, thank you, mamma!" exclaimed Isabella. " 1 don't want to go to London." "The matter then is settled?" inquired Sir Huston.   1^;       JRESTER POWERS GIRLHOOD.     83 ,' Oh, yes!" said the ladies. Here is a good place for the portras," said Lady Falkstone/ " by the side of Catherine's. This portrait was a very beautiffil one." "She was my own aunt, papa, was she not?"Isabella asked.     -  "Yes," he answered, sadly; " she was my only sister, Lady- Catherine Falkstone.  Hers was a sad fate. This picture was painted just before her marriage." "And is it true, papa, that she was lost-at sea, on her voyage to --to --  Lady Falkstone touched her shoulder, and Isabella saw that her father had turned away to hide his emo- tion. He had loved his sister very dearly, and although almost fifteen years had rolled round since the sad event of her death, he could not even yet bear to speak of it. They all three left the gallery, and Isabella, thinking that Hester might be upstairs, left her parents at the library door. She found Hester in her dressing-room engaged in reading, and Roland hovering around, muttering to herself. Isabella felt uneasy, for she could not help noticing the distrust with which her woman watched her friend. Roland  was a faithful woman in her duties, and was all that Isabella desired as a waiting- woman; therefore she regretted exceedingly that the unfortunate suspicion  against Hester could not be entirely gotten rid of. Roland and c-Grieves were not persons to let such matters be forgotten. They had told first one con- fidential friend, and then another, until by degrees an i., RolndandGrevs wreno pesos o lt uc  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7752-00000043"/> 84       Ad JUDGE NOT;"OR, exaggerated story of the diamond spray was going through the house. Some looked wise, and said, "Ah, I thought so. Haint she a purty one now!"While others like Mr. Rubens remained true friends to Hester, and did battle for her bravely. It kept up a continual excitement in the servants' hall in the even- ings when the- domestics were together. And many a story was related in awful English, of transportations, imprisonments, and even hangings, for no worse crime than that of stealing a gem so valuable. Thus matters went on ; the little spark had kindled a big fire. In the mean time, Sir RIuston had written to the artist, Mr.- Markham, and all preliminaries had been settled relating to the projected pictures. Mr. Mark- ham's replies to Sir Huston's letters were modest, and couched in simple but elegant language. He thanked him most cordially for having considered his health and pleasure in the matter, and hoped that it would be convenient for Sir Huston to have him commence as soon as possible. Inna few more days the artist was introduced to the family at "West Oakland." He was a gentleman, they could discover at a glance, although his garments were threadbare and glossy with constant use. Mr. Markham was of medium height, very thin, dark, and sallow, and, though scarcely twenty-oight years old, his hair was thickly sprinkled with gray. His ex- pression was usually sad, but if for a while he could forget care, his eyes, would kindle with intelligent fire, and his whole face become bright and handsome. In having been fortunate enough to secure the patronage t,   of Sir Huston Falkstone, penniless as he was, he be- held success in the distance. But what if he should fail?"I will not fail!" he said. "I will make my- self a name, and my country shall honor it!" Sir Huston did not despise the young man for the appearance of his coat. There was something within him that won his regards; and before the pictures were commenced, Mr. Markham was the recipient of most cordial attention. For, being a man of per- ception, Sir Huston saw that he needed recreation, and that too much of his time had been spent in close application in unhealthy rooms. He at once placed at his disposal everything that would in any way ad- vance his pleasure, or benefit his health. Thus a week had scarcely gone by since the artist's arrival It "West Oakland," before he was benefited materially . both in health and spirits. He had become quite a favorite, and Isabella frequently spoke; of him to Hester, who had as yet only seen him in company with, Sir Huston at a distance. With all a woman's curiosity, Hester, of course; wanted to know so pleas- ant a gentleman. An opportunity presented itself soon. They--she, Isabella, and Markham- met in the park one afternoon. He had thought Miss Falkstone very beautiful, almost the most beautiful young lady he had ever seen, until he saw Hester. There was a more tender, holy beauty, a perfectness of outline one rarely sees, in her face. Her large blue, tender eyes,  shaded by lashes of midnight blackness, and her mouth so exquisite in its curves, could not fail to attract an   &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7752-00000044"/> 86    "r JUDGE NOT; " O,? artist's admiration. He walked with them to the terrace. Hester, all unskilled in art, bade her friend good-by, for it was time that she should be going home. With his usual politeness Mr. Markham offered to walk with her. Hester all abashed looked at Isabella. ' By all means, Mr. Markham, go," said Isabella. "The way to the village is a pleasant one, and Hester can point out so many pretty things which you else might fail to notice." They turned down tihe avenue. "There are more beautiful trees in these grounds than I have ever seen in any one place in my life, and I have travelled a good deal," said Markham. "Yes, these bordering this avenue are very fine," Hester answered. "There is one, that great giant oak yonder. What a trunk it has! I was examining the cavity in it to- day. A few more winter storms and it will be gone I fear," said Markham.. Hester looked nervously toward the old oak, and some of the painful feelings she not long before ex- perienced, came over her. Nevertheless she said,- "I should be sorry for it to be blown down. It has been such a nice home for the birds and squirrels so long. The peacocks, too, love to roost upon its branches, and I have seen the deer flocking to its shade in the summer." Mr. Ma4iham seemed not to have minded what she said, for he asked immediately after she had finished, if she lived near the village.   H  'ESTER POrERS' GIRLHOOD.   87 "I live in the village," Hester said. Markham wished very much to know more, but he was too well-bred to question. He felt surprised at her walking to the village, though he well knew the habits of English ladies. Was she a relative of the Falkstones, or not? The question puzzled him not a little. He said nothing, however, and they walked on, talking of the lovely scenery before them. There was something so fresh, so natural in all Hester's remarks, that Markham felt as if he had but met again with some bright- spirit he had known in boyhood. He inquired her name. ' It is Hester Powers," said the artless girl. "Miss Powers," he said, as if to, impress it upon his memory.. "No, not Miss, only Hester. I am but a village- maiden." "Not a connection of the Falkstones?" "Oh, no!" said Hester; " there is a wide difference between our social positions; but, nevertheless, Miss Falkstone and I are great friends; we are 'almost like sisters. There is my home yonder, that cottage on the hill!" There was a sort of joyous feeling in Markham's breast as he thought that Hester was only a cottager's daughter, and, as he retraced his steps to the hall, his thoughts were full of her, so beautiful, so interesting, and bright. He taxed his memory to repeat the words she had spoken, and when he retired to his chamber, which was in one of the old wings of the building, the furniture of which was dark and ponderous, and so  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7752-00000045"/> 88       "JUDGiE NOT; " oR, quaint that one might have supposed that it had been made in the days of the giants, he threw himself into a chair to think. The soft, bird-like voice was present with him still. The shadows gathered over the landscape and the stars twinkled in the heavens, but still he sat thinking of Hester. Lights were brought in high silver candle- sticks, and a light fire was liindled, for the mornings and evenings were still cool, and the spacious rooms were made bright by its pleasant glow. Markham wheeled up a great, old carved chair, which was lined with rich, but faded damask, and sat before the fire. He looked into the red embers, watched the sparks as they went up the chimney; but he thought only of the village maiden, and contrasted her, in her simplicity, freshness, and bloom, with the London beauties, all powdered, puffed, and ruffled. Suddenly he sprang out of his chair; his face seemed in a mo- ment to have become younger. There was bright- ness in his eye, hope in the smile that lighted up his face. He walked up and cown the room with a firm tread. "What if my present work should purchase me a name?"  he murmured. 'Then, then my for- tune, or rather, a living, will be sure."- The color deepened in his cheek, and his step became quicker. A( Ahl Then my 4ife need not be so lonely, so deso-, late!" He threw himself again into the great oaken chair before the fire, and began to dream a waking dream. He fancied a pretty home, a little cottage, perhaps, in the suburbs of the great metropolis, a studio in it, hung around with finished and un- ,    X           HESTER POWERS GIRLHOOD.      89 finished- pictures. Canvases, too, strewn upon the easels, a rose-bush peeping in at the open window, and some one, a lady, perhaps, leaning over his shoulder. His fancies were very pleasing, and he indulged them a long time, and, by and by, he fell into a sound, re- freshing sleep. He was an early riser, and next morning at dawn he was up, and so was Roland. And, as Markham was going out to take an early stroll, he encountered her on one of the landings. Her arms were rolled up in her apron, and she looked very much as if she had not taken time to dress properly. She was generally exceedingly- neat; and, when in dainty cap and ribbons, Roland wasby no means an ill-looking woman. In her own estimation she was pretty, quite so. Now, strange as it-may seem, the thought had crossed her mind that- the professional London gentleman, now at "West Oakland," might not be indifferent to her charms. "She had heard of stranger things;" beside, the very novel-she was reading now had just such an affair in it. Imagine, then, what very naughty feelings must have been produced in her heart when she saw him, the very one whom she had set her heart upon, posi- tively walking off down the broad avenue, in daylight, too, with Hester, that sinful girl, who had coveted her friend's jewels, and the one above all others in the world whom   she disliked! She had flown off to Grieves, " her dear Grieves," in almost a breathless state. "Now I said how hit wid be, my dear, from the first;- that gal's hambitious," said Grieves. "But   &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7752-00000046"/> 90      "&amp; JUDGE NOT ; "OR, Roland, you ought to be hup to 'er; or haint you pluck enough?" "Pluck!" said Roland, in an injured tone, "'who can circumvent the wicked?" Now, my dear reader, these two women were ex- ceedingly pious persons and could see the smallest mote in others' eyes, while the beam in their own re- mained fixed and immovable. They could repeat a hundred texts in the Bible applicable to the sins of those around them, but, unfortunately, had never hap- pened upon, the one reading thus: "If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that man's relig- ion is vain." Strange they had skipped that awkward passage, with many others of a like character, while they had pounced, like hungry vultures, upon those applying to the sins of others. Hours they would sit over the Bible looking up these passages, excited in their zeal, and eager to pluck the very last virtue from their unfortunate victim. Roland watched very long for Marklham's return from the village. She was very curious and, very an- gry, for she foolishy considered that Hester had been infringing upon her rights in permitting the London gentleman to walk to the village with her. And before retiring, she had stepped very lightly to the gentle- man's chamber door, and on the sheep-skin mat before it she had kneeled,- not for any devotional purpose,- oh, no! She --had come there to peep! - peep through the key-hole. She could see his face now and then, as he walked up and down the room, and was sur-   X.          HESTER POWERS GIRLHOOD.     - 91 prised to see how bright and happy he looked; and in her anger, she attributed it to the true cause, - " that gal!"Her heart was very full of bitterness, and she left the door determining to keep her eyes wide open, and to watch diligently the comings and goings of "Miss Hester Powers." "Up again so early!" she thought, as she met him on the landing, ' he must be going to the village." In this, however, Roland was mistaken; he only went out to walk in the park to take his usual exercise before beginning his day's work. He came in in time for breakfast, and, as was his custom, as soon as that meal was over he went to the apartment now known as the " studio," and which communicated with his chambers by a sort of closet entrance. When there, at his work, Roland felt contented; she thought him  safe from Hester's wiles. It was, however, strange that she should forget that, from the east win- dow of the studio there was a full view of the turnpike road, the church, and the village. By and by Hester came up the road, stopping now and then to gather the wild flowers; and more than Ro- land was watching for her. When out of sight Mark- ham took his seat before his work. A beautiful, half-' finished picture of Isabella was before him on the easel. Those fine, classic eyes were looking out upon him from the canvas; but he only thought of Hester. He believed in what he called fate. Fate was leading him, - had led him,-to meet with a being such as his fancies had pictured to him, even in boyhood, pure, beautiful, and bright. Still thinking, he went on with  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7752-00000047"/> 92       "JUDGE NOT;i"OR, his work; there was firmness, decision in his touch; he seemed to be inspired with a new power; the old feelings of despondency had given place to hope, to confidence. He sang and whistled by turns over his work. The future, which, a few weeks before, had looked so impenetrably black and hopeless, now seemed full of promise; his work grew, and he had the satisfaction of knowing that his patrons were' more than pleased with his success. Whether by accident or design, we cannot say, but we know that Hester and the artist frequently met. They found the highest enjoyment in each other's soci- ,ety, and Sir Huston and his lady were pleased to see two, Whose spirits seemed so congenial, brought together. Isabella was pleased also, but she said, "I am afraid he will take her away from us. I could scarcely live now, without Hester." "That is selfish, my child," said Lady Falkstone. "Our highest enjoyments should be in seeking the good of others. Markham is destined to become famous in his profession; he will amass wealth. They are worthy of each other, and we should not allow a selfish feeling - -to hinder so good a cause." Hester had discovered very soon that Markham lacked one thing: he gave no thought to religion. He had no desire to look into its mysteries; "W hy should we, Hester?" he asked, carelessly, one evening. "Isn't there misery enough in the world without ham- pering our thoughts perpetually with the dread of death?" "We should not view it in that light," said Hester;  .   N HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     93 "the grave hath no dread, no terror for those who are believers." "Teach me, Hester," said the artist. "Religion, as you possess it, is fair and beautiful. It does not make you dull and severe, but rather lends -a charm. Perhaps, if you would try, you might induce me to be- come a true Christian." "'Oh, do!"Hester exclaimed. "It is so sweet, so delightful to feel that the now and hereafter are both provided for; that joy and peace are in store for us where Jesus reigns. You will try to become a Chris- tian, will you not? It is not hard; there is nothing difficult about it; we are told 'only believe'--and- will you try?" "Yes, Hester, but you must help me. I shall need to be guided." And Hester did try. She tried to show her friend that there were joys above, endless, eternal; that be-- yond the narrow passage of the grave the mansions of God stood with pastures fair and green, and the river of life flowing onward for evermore. The shadows passed away from the sceptic's mind; very slowly, however; but he who had once doubted, now believed. Hester had been quietly working a good work, while some around her were watching, listening, and distorting her very words. The report had gone abroad, through Roland, that Hester would soon be married, and marvellous were the tales which Grieves and others retailed of the young girl's forward conduct in the affair. "Oh, you women, women!" said Mr. Rubens, one &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7752-00000048"/> "        "JUDGE NOT." evening, after he had heard their chattering for upward of an hour, "( why can't ye leave the child alone? But no, it's just as somebody writ years ago,- "'Naught can to peace the busy female charm; If she can't do good, she must do harm.' "But," he continued, "I'll keep out o' yer way, for the wisest man that ever lived did say, ' That a fool is accounted a wise man when he holds his tongue.'"So old Rubens, thinking that by and by this much talking would end in either mischief or smoke, kept his peace. But as time went on, and Roland saw that all the artist's spare time was spent in Hester's society, in spite of her many efforts to prevent it, she became more embittered, and talked imprudently; and, instead of gaining Markham's good opinion by thrusting her- self before him on all occasions, he really entertained a dread of her. He saw that she was a prying person, having more than once surprised her at her trick of peeping. She had a soft, cat-like tread, and one scarce- ly ever heard her coming; she: was upon you before you knew it. Having satisfied himself in reference to the woman's habits, Markham kept his studio door locked. He did not care to satisfy her curiosity.   , .\    CHAPTER    XI. THE ARTIST S SUCCESS. FOR two weeks Markham had been going on, almost. perfectly undisturbed with his work, finishing the pic- tures up. Sir Huston had been in London, and Lady Falkstone confined to her chamber, and of course the young ladies did not visit the artist's studio alone. Isabella's picture was finished, and the jirl. with life- like beauty seemed to stand out upon the canvas  breathing creature.. Marlham was in raptures; for now he felt sure that success was before him. No more starving, no more racking his weary brain' to elucidate ' the problem how he should live. No, his present suc- cess would pave the way to fortune. He felt it. Now, he walked up and down with hope beaming from his eyes. The. finished picture stood in an admi- rable position, where a pure light fell upon it, and by its side there stood anotherpicture, just the head and shoulders of a young girl. The abundant and flowing hair, the deep blue, tender eyes, the perfect lips slight- ly parted, were so almost real that the artist himself  felt, as he gazed upon it, that life, soul, was there too. Markham did not care that another human eye should *   ,     &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7752-00000049"/> 96        JUD GE NOT;"OR, see it. It was only made for himself. He was stand- ing before it, intending every moment to return it to its secret corner, when Sir Huston and Lady Falkstone pounced upon him. Poor Markham! There was no use in crimsoning, - no use in trying to hide the stolen treasure; for, with- out seeming to notice his confusion, the gentleman and lady stood quietly surveying it. "How fortunate you have been in them both!-" said Lady Falkstone. "They are perfect; in Hester's, ex- pression particularly." '"How true to life it is!"Sir Huston said. "Hester is a lovely girl!" "But what is surprising to me is, that Hester is so nervous that I should have fancied the sitting for her portrait would have been a most unpleasant task to her; and indeed it was but yesterday that she said it would be impossible for her to do so." "That is singular," Sir Huston remarked. Markham saw that the truth had better be told at once; otherwise Hester might seem to have deceived. "Allow me," he said, coloring to the very roots of his hair, " to put the matter in its true light. The young lady never sat for this portrait; it is a stolen picture, and she is even ignorant of its existence!" The lady and gentleman looked at each other. "Can it be possible?" "It is!" said the. artist; "the picture is- painted from memory." "Nothing deeper?" quizzed Sir Huston with a smile. The artist smiled too.   ES TER EPOWERS' GIRLHOOD.     97 "Well, well, we shall understand each other by and by. You have no objection to dispose of this picture?" Markham hesitated. "I had not such a thought; in fact, I have no right." "I will bear the young lady's displeasure,"-Sir Hus- ton said. "Will you part with it ,as it is for one hun- dred guineas?" "Will you permit me to reflect upon it?" "Why? Yqu shall possess the original, we the pic- ture. I wish to own so perfect a likeness of my daugh- ter's friend." The bargain was closed! "One hundred guineas!" repeated Markham   over in his mind. It seemed to him that this sum, together with the price agreed upon for the Falkstone family por- traits, was a fortune, They all three turned to Isabella's picture. It was life-size, and her dress was the same in which she had appeared on Christmas-eve,-pale blue, covered with rich lace, and girdled at the waist by heavy cords of pearls; neck and arms bare, and in her beautiful hair was fastened the little brilliant spray. So perfect was the likeness, that, as the parents stood before it, they almost fancied they could see her:move; while thus absorbed, Roland had stolen a peep into the forbidden room. "Ah! now I see. 'Tis no wonder that the bad, de- ceitful Londoner kept the door locked. My, my! 'tis a sinful world, sure, that we Christians do dwell hin!"She slowly turned away, utterly disgusted with "Iow folks, :-them that 'adn't a drop of Christian 7  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7752-00000050"/> 98      c JUDGE NOT; "OR, blood -in their veins." Suddenly she remembered, or supposed she did, how many times she had seen Hes- ter "sneaking snake-like" through the house, and of course was going to or coming from the studio. "Oh! the deceit of the wicked creature!" said the pious Grieves with uplifted hands. ." But haint our gentlefoqs blind, my dear?" she said with a sigh. "Blind!"' repeated Roland. "Oh for another man of God to drag the awful scales from their hies!" " "Why, there's the parson, the very one a body should look to in such times, a havin' both of 'em over to the parsonage to tea, forsooth," remarked Grieves. "And that's because he is thinkin' to marry 'em, hoping that the master here will stand the wedding expenses, and so will fee him well. - Money! money! my dear Grieves,; haint hit done a power of mischief hin this world, though?"-- "Money! money! --I say, - drat my buttons!

Down went Rubens' emphatic fist upon the table, caus- ing a great jingling among the glass and plate which he had just placed upon it. The women looked at the excited old man in alarm, as he pulled his red cotton handkerchief over his bald pate. "Don't speak so loud, Mr. Rubens; for mercy's sake, don't bring the master here!" 7'^, "I can't help lifting my voice," said .^bens; ,' for why can't ye go on yer hown way, and leave the young 'uns to theirs?"

Just as if we was has hold has the 'ills!"The insulted lady fiounced out of the room with a very injured air, while Roland, stepping lightly to Ru- bens' side, said, in the very blandest of tones, "Now, dear Mr. Rubens, you may be sure, that neither Grieves nor me want to lose your good feelings; we have a very high respect for you, and value you as a good Christian brother and friend." She laid her hand upon his arm, and repeated slowly the passage, " ' If a man ,be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual-'" "'Ye that are spiritual!

Be it to sit together o' nights a feedin' the happetite wey home-brewed beer, and all the while a scandalizing o' them ye should be- showing a good example to?- ye be far from being spiritual!- ye be envious and evil-minded, and be in need o' forgive.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7752-00000051"/> 100      "JUDGaE NOT;0' OR, ness and pardon!"Again, 3r. Rubens' fist went down upon the table, and Mrs. Roland was glad to make her escape from his presence. As she ran up the stairs, the words which dropped from her lips did not indicate that her respect for M1r. Rubens was of a very high order. She was angry and flushed. "What his the matter, Roland?" Sir Huston asked the question from the gallery above. "Oh! -nothing, nothing indeed, sir, but,- but; I'm hin a 'urry." "Ah! is that all?"He passed on to Isabella's dress-room, where she and Hester were busy at some fancy work. The April showers had kept them in- doors all day; there was one falling then. One mo- ment the landscape was glowing in sunshine, the next overcast and shadowy. Sir Huston was fond of such days, he loved to spend them in the house; and it was one of his chief pleasures to read to the girls, or tell ^them stories of his travels in foreign lands. Lady Falkstone frequently joined this pleasant little group. In this way Hester had gained some very useful infor- mation; but, to-day, although Sir Huston announced, to them that he had something very interesting to tell them, Hester seemed totally indifferent to his remark; her thoughts were somewhere else and she scarcely heard him. The truth was, Mr. Markham's engagement at "West Oakland" was drawing to a close. The pictures were finished, and he had received a communication from   PHESTER POWERS' GIBLHOOD.               101 Lord Grumby to the effect, that it would be well for him to return to London as soon as his business with Sir Huston was ended.  His lordship expressed him- self delighted to have heard from Sir Huston of his- Markham's - success, and assured him that the future looked promising. Almost three months' intercourse with a man of Markham's intelligence, graceful and pleasant manners, combining, as he did, a high moral character, with now some of the bright truths, the dawning lights of religion, we should not wonder that Hester felt sorry to part with hil. She'did feel sorry, and perhaps her heart was not so free as it had been before he had crossed her path. He had not told her that he was going away. Sir Huston had spoken of it, and'he had seen the tell-tale blush that had mantled her cheeks. The thought shot across her mind, painfully, "'Will he go away to London, and forget the village maiden?" She wished, - and perhaps it was a natural feeling,- that she! had been born a little higher up in the social scale. Every pleasure brings with it its own peculiar -trial, and Hester began to find that the further on in the road through life she got, the more keenly she felt the trials which she had to encounter. Troubles in childhood soon pass away. A kiss or a gentle word has a healing power, but by and by we need more. We require patience, --faith. Hester knew where to carry her troubles, and she said, from her heart, '"Help me to'set my affections upon things above." That lit- tle prayer perchance was heard, for Hester never failed   &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7752-00000052"/> 102       "' JUDGE NOT." to find comfort and consolation in communion with God. She wished that\ Markham had told her that he was going away, himself; she was thinking so, when Isa- bella called to her to say that the pictures were already hung in the gallery, and that Sir Huston had sent for them to come down to see them. Yes, there they were, in rich and massive frames, hung beside those so old, so dark with time. Her own picture, too. How strange for it to be there! Ah! that stolen picture The beautiful, calm face, looking so mildly forth from the canvas, would, by and by, tell indeed, a strange story. We say, "Truth is stranger than fiction."

DURING his stay at "West Oakland," Markham had become a frequent visitor at the Powers' cottage. He had become quite attached to the old people; to Simon, particularly, who was both entertaining and intelligent, and took pride in telling anecdotes as far back as his grandfather's time; he never wearied of them, never grew tired of praising Nancy's house-keeping, and Markham had niot been slow to observe the neatness and order of the little house; it was always as neat as wax, the floors prettily sanded in a variety of patterns. At all seasons she managed to have flowers of some sort in the best room. They all loved flowers, and the garden was full of them and. the beds were all neatly bordered with box or scallop-shells. Their vegetables, too, were always more forward then their neighbors, for Simon was a skilful gardener. It was now just the season when the orchards and fruit-trees were in full bloom, and the country was beginning to clothe itself in greenness and bud. , " It was Markham's last evening at "West Oakland, " and Hester and he were leaving the mansion together. 103.   &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7752-00000053"/> 104      a JUD GE NOT; "OR, "Let us go in our old path, Hester,"' he said, "down the turnpike. I want to have one more look at the open country before I go back to town." They walked on slowly, for they both felt, "It will be our last walk." They had walked more than half way to the village when they stopped, and leaned over a low gate to take a long look away over the country now so beautiful. Neither spoke for some time; but at length Markham said, rather abruptly, - "Hester, would you like to live in London?" "I don't know," she answered. "I have seen very little beyond my native village. Once I did go to the fair in the next town, but -" "I mean," said Markham, " would you like to live t in London, - make it your home?" "I think I should," Hester said. "I have been- told that there is so much to be seen there, I think I should like to live there." "I am glad;" he said; " for Hester, I am going to ask your father and mother to give you to me. Will you become my wife?" Hester knew nothing about the foolish mockery called " sentiment." She had learned to love him, and, with the candor and true simplicity of her character she modestly confessed her feelings and promised to become his bride. Ah, how bright. was the future to them now! How beautiful the prospect to Markham! He had lived such a lonely, gloomy life; but that was behind; sue. cess, happiness, was before him.   I HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.    105 "And will father and mother go, too?"Hester asked. "They shall live with us, if they prefer to do so; but perhaps they would much prefer to live in their pretty cottage in the summer, when we could spend some time with them. In winter they should stay with us in our little home." "Oh, yes! how nicely we will manage things. Father would so like to be in London. I have often heard him say how much he would like to see Tower Hill, over which the blood of the martyrs ran. Yes, we shall be so happy. Father shall see all the sights - dear, dear father!" The last half-way to the village seemed very short. They had not said half they wished to when the vil- lage came in sight., Those pretty cottages,--those village homes,- how peaceful, how inviting they ap- peared, on either side of the broad road! The May- flower and the laburnum waved their tops in 'the pleas- ant breeze. The honeysuckle and clematis climbed and twined over the rustic porches, and simple flowers sent forth sweet, fragrance from the little gardens. And prettiest of all these peaceful homes was the cot upon the hill. So Markham thought. He felt happier there than in the fine '"West Oakland" mansion with all its grandeur. Grace Homes had often met with the artist, and Nancy had invited her to drink tea with them, it being the last evening he would spend with them for some time. So she was there, ready to meet them with a' smile as they came in. And, while Hester went to help her  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7752-00000054"/> 106      "JUDGE NOT; "OR, mother, putting a touch here and there, looking at the potato-cake, which was sending forth a most appetizing odor from the oven, stamping the yellow butter-pats or transferring the rich cream from a common blue to a finer bowl belonging to the set which Nancy's mother had given to her on her wedding-day, Grace entertained the guest. She indulged in her favorite theme, - of the days when she and Hester strung buttercups and daisies for each other's necks, or hunted the grasshoppers through the tall meadow grass, or chased the butterflies from flower to flower. "Oh, they were such happy times!" said Grace. "But they were soon over. Why couldn't they stay longer with us? We were so happy when we used to angle in the streams with willow twigs and pin hooks." "They are said to be the brightest and happiest years of life," said Markham. "My mother used to say that youth was made up of golden grains," "Hester and I were happier then than we shall ever be again." 1 I hope not," Markham said, smiling brightly. 4 We dream in childhood, and awake to higher, holier enjoy- ments in riper years." Simon Powers came in then, and presently tea was ready. The setting sun sent in a cheerful, tender glow through the open doorway, and the genial breeze came, too, bringing with it the delicate perfume of the lilac. What fairer picture of domestic happiness could be presented! The father's ruddy face shone with pleas- ure as he looked around his pleasant home, upon his thrifty wife, and beautiful daughter. His eye beamed   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.       107 with joy as he received his welcome kiss after his day's toil.-- Ah, contentment "Is a jewel which no Indian mine can buy, No chemio art can counterfeit; It makes men rich in greatest poverty, Makes water wine, turns wooden cups to gold, The homely whistle to sweet music's strain; Seldom it comes, to few from leaven sent, That much in little - all in naught -content I1X Simon owned the jewel, and no king was richer than he. His cottage was to him a lordly mansion, and he asked for nothing more of this world's goods than just what he already possessed.  His daily prayer was, "Continue thy loving-kindness unto thy servant, 0 Lord." This evening, at tea, Hester sat on one side of him, and Markham on the other. The old man looked first at one and then at the other. "Will 'e ask me for my child, my only one?" he thought, as he sipped his tea. "Well, well, I 'ope not." He drove away the unwelcome thought, and talked of other things until the meal was finished. "And now, Mr. Markham," said Simon, "while they're a clearin' hup the place, ye might step wey me to the garden, to my mind it never looked purtier. I haint seed the truck finer or more for'ard for many a spring-and has to that, ye might pick nosegays any- where, now, for, the lanes and hedges be full- of flower." "Yes," said Markham, "I am sorry to go back to the city, for I am so fond of country life." It was almost dark now, and. the two men were  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7752-00000055"/> 108      "JTrDGE NOT; "OR, standing together by a little apricot-tree. It was, per- haps, the best opportunity he might have, and Markham asked the old man for his daughter. "For Hester!" said Simon, lifting his old, shaggy, white beaver from his brow- "' for Hester!"There was pain on every feature. "How kin ye ask me for me only one, young man? Hester be hall we've got; she's the joy of the cot, -the light o' hour hold days, - ye surely couldn't ask her o' us?" "I know that I am asking a great deal of you," said Markham, kindly; " but if I had not done so, some one else would. - You could hardly expect Hester to re- main unmarried very long." "Ay, that may be so, - that may be so, for Hester be a sprightly girl. But 'tis 'ard, young man, 'tis 'ard to part with the honly one, though I believe in mar- riage. It be a happy life, hif a man gets a good, spry wife; and, thank God, I was a lucky man; my Nancy's a good wife. Did ye speak to Hester about the mat- ter?" "I did, as we walked from 'West Oakland,' this evening." ' And what is her mind?" the old man asked, his troubled face bent down. "She has promised, with her parents' consent, to become my wife." The old man turned his head, and brushed away the tears which were blinding his eyes. ( Ah! well, well!" he said; " if hit be the Lord's will, we must bow to it. But, young man, ye will a' made the 'earthstone deso-    HESTER POWERS' GIRLHzOOD.    109 late! Ye will be tender to the lamb, -be tender to the child?" Markham took the old man's hand. "I will do all in my power to make her life a happy one. Come, cheer up, - you will gain a son, you know. In summer we will come down and enjoy ourselves among the hills, and in winter we will take you both up to the city, and show you the wonders of London. Will you give her ,to me?" They held each other's hand, and the promise was given. The garden had lost its charm for Simon that night. They went back into the cottage. Hester had seen them standing by the tree, and thought perhaps what they were talking about, and her trembling hands could scarcely hold the cups she was wiping.   , "Why, Hester, child, what ails ye? Will ye smash me best things? Give me the cloth, for goodness' sake!" said her mother. Not a word did Hester say as she flew to her own little room to try and compose herself, for she had seen them coming into the house. She stood by the lattice in the dim evening light, nervously brushing imaginary specks from her white apron. As she heard her father coming toward her, she could not turn to meet his sad face, for she knew how he must feel. Hester!" he said, softly, laying his hand upon her head,- "Hester, dear" Her head was upon his shoulder. "Be yer heart in this matter, child? Speak plain to yer hold father. Do yer love this stranger, Hester?"   &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7752-00000056"/> "O      "JUDGE NOT; "OR, x "Yes, father." "'That is enough,- since you were .a wee thing, a dandling on me knee, child, I ha'e asked for you, happiness, -'ard as it comes to us to part wey ye, I will say, ' Goodness and mercy have followed me,' for my prayer be heard." And then the old man's face was turned upward, while his hands rested upon her head. "Father," he said, "bless my little one, and keep her forever in thy love." There was a pause,- and then he led her out into the best room, where Grace and Nancy and Markham were.  "Take her," said the old man. "Take her; but ye must keep yer promise made to me under the apricot-tree. Hester ha'e been reared up tenderly, and her 'art be soft and tender as a baby's. Ye will be tender to my child?" "You may trust her to my care," said Markham; " and then there was another pause. Grace had turned away and was weeping silently, while Nancy, in the excess of her joy, had brought in a couple of mould candles, and stood comparing in her mind the gentle- manly-looking young man before her with the " coun- try clowns," in -blue smock frocks and leggings, who had "' dared to cast sheep's-eyes at her daughter. Hes- ter was born for something better, and would be a lady sure and sartin!" Nancy's ailments, as usual, were forgotten; she became almost gay, although all day long she had been " half dead with lumbago in her back." Now she was brisk and talkative, and very soon the little household had lostl all awkward feelings. Simon smoked his evening pipe in the corner, and Nancy talked to them all.   RHESTER POWERS GIRLHOOD.     1" At nine o'clock Markham rose to go, and the good woman found an 'opportunity at .the door to tell him how glad she felt, that so " fine a gentleman had fan- cied Hester." Hester walked out to the garden-gate with him, because long before she would be at "West Oakland," on the morrow, he would be on his way to London. She watched him as he went over the hill, and until his form was lost in the deep shade of the valley. Then- she went into the cottage. Markham went on, over the broad turnpike, thinking only of Hester, his promised bride. Very little did he sleep that night,-he was too busy thinking of the future,-too happy. For more than three months he had been at no expense, - only making money and a name. The check for hundreds of pounds was safe in his shabby'little pocket-book, and Lord Grumby had expressly said that orders were waiting for him in the city. With two such friends as Grumby and Sir Hus- ton Falkstone,!what had he to fear? The poor fellow felt almost like a child in his joy and the plans he laid for Hester's happiness! Sleep!- no, he could not sleep that night. His little portmanteau was packed before daylight; he was ready to take his departure from "West Oak- land." He had taken leave of the ladies the evening before, but Sir Huston had promised to breakfast with# him at seven. Punctually at the moment that meal was served; and the two gentlemen did ample justice to it, and then they partec. There was some staging to be done  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7752-00000057"/> "2      "JUDGE NOT; "O2 on the first part of Markham's journey, but the jolting of the old " diligence" did not annoy him; he was too absorbed in his pleasant day-dreams. "Here we are, just in time!" bawled the driver. The shrieking engine, too, announced that they had reached the railroad depot. And, for once in his life Markham felt like a gentleman. The consciousness of having money in his pocket made him feel indifferent to the gaze of people. The great babel of towers and smoking chimneys, of busy, thronging life, was at last reached; and St. Paul's, with its great dome, and cross, and the monu- ment whose top was lost in the misty atmosphere, were before him. "Take a cab, sir?" Markham jumped into the first at hand. "Drive me to the ISt. George buildings,' Picca- dilly," he said. Away rattled the cab. The St. George chambers were by no means elegant apartments. They were in a high, narrow building, in a narrow, dingy-looking street, where peddlers and venders of small wares kept their stands. The St. George was on the corner of said street, and was for the most part occupied by struggling young men,--artists, authors, clerks, and the like. Chambers on the first floor were, of course, "rented at a higher rate than the upper. And Mark- ham heretofore had found it necessary to live in one of its very top ones. Alh! he almost shuddered as he jumped from the cab opposite to the gloomy entrance- door. The cabman received his fare, and drove off;   X HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.    113 and Markham, portmanteau in hand, ascended one after another of the narrow, winding flights, leading to his desolate home, - " chambers," - so called! The little dusty room looked strangely dreary to him as he entered it, and he wondered, as he. stood looking around upon the confused masses of old sketch" es and art material generally, and breathed the close, painty smell that greeted him, how it was that he had ever managed to exist in such a place. His old un- happy feeling crept back over him. But he had no sooner seated himself in a miserable, broken-backed chair then there came a knock upon the door. "An' sure its meself that's deloited to see ye back, Misther Markham," said a very short, very fat, very red-haired woman as, she indulged in a succession of dips. "Have any letters come for me within the last few days, Mrs. Dougherty?" inquired Markham. "Sure yer honor, and thegy're safe, they are," and Mrs. Dougherty proceeded to fumble in a heavy wallet at her side, which she called her pocket. "Ah! now, an' here they are sure," as she handed to him a couple of letters tied together with a rather greasy-looking string. "Did you get a line from me yesterday?" "An sure yer honor I did, but then I hated to med- dle; your traps be all about so, sir." "And so you did not wish to clean up, until I came to give you instructions, my good woman, hey?" "An' sure yer right, me darlin," said Mrs. Dougherty, with her good-natured laugh. 8 &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7752-00000058"/> "4      4"JUDGE- NOT; "OR, ' Very well; I'll give you a call when I want you." Several more dips, and Mrs. Dougherty's fat little person was out upon the landing, closing the door after her. "He's a nice gentleman, sure, though he do live so high up, he is," soliloquized the woman; "and he's growed fat, too, and so well-l1okin'. Och, and he's a nice gentleman." It was only four o'clock, just striking; but it was one of those cloudy, dark days when almost everything looked gloomy, and in that dingy garret, Markham had hardly light enough to read his letters. The view from the dust-covered window was anything but a pleasant one on fine days; for, with the exception of a narrow strip of gray sky, nothing could be seen but a forest of Chimney-tops, each contributing its portion of black or grayish smoke to the volume ever hanging over the mighty city. What a contrast to the scenes he had just left, -the clear sky, the wide-spreading un- dulating country, so fresh and almost dazzling with its flowers and blossoms! Markham sighed and con- cluded his letters. One was from Lord Grumby, wish- ing him to meet him at his club-rooms on the next morning. Visions of success again began to float around our artist. - He rang the bell, lighted a cigar, and elevated his feet; and while the good Mrs. Dougherty is ar- ranging matters, getting a sort of little bachelor tea and fixing the little sofa-bed, we will, with our reader's permission, go back a little way in the artist's life; just to his fortunate acquaintance with Lord Grumby.   HESTER POWERS GIRLHOOD.     115 They met by accident in one of the little continental towns, whither the young man had gone in search of cheap living and health. Lord Grumby was a bachelor of fifty, excessively find of good living, very gouty, and gloried in patronizing what he termed " worth." He knew everybody, had been everywhere; and what Lord Grumby had -not seen, was not worth looking af-  ter. It was perfectly admissible for him, being an old man and a lord, to ask the young man in shabby clothes a few questions, -so he thought as he drew up his chair and began a conversation. "I was born in London," the artist answered to the question as to his native place, "Aw! indeed! and I, too," said his lordship, and with no further delay acquainted himself with the young man's business, prospects, health, together with other matters. !"Got any of your work with you?" Markham soon produced several fine specimens of- his painting.,' "Why," said the old gentleman, in his pompous way,'-" dull times, you say! My dear fellow, there's a fortune in your brush; you want a start, -a start, - that's all." Poor Markham!  He thought of his worn-out and empty purse, and involuntarily answered, "Yes, I do want a start." "Ah! I thought so. Have you dined?" Markham had not; he scarcely ever did, now. The old, portly, good-natured gentleman guessed as much. He never looked once at the threadbare clothes. of his  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7752-00000059"/> "6    "- d JUDGE NOT; "OR new-made acquaintance, but pulled his arm through his own and started off, talking of Rome and pictures or anything else he chanced to think of. At dinner he swallowed wine until his guest began to doubt if he would be able to stand when the meal was ended; but it seemed not to affect him in the least. "Now,' he said, as he pushed from him an empty decanter, " when I see a young man resist temptation, I honor him. I know then that he is made of good stuff, and is worthy a lift along the road through life. You drink one glass,--I, twenty. Now, I've met with young men in my time who would have felt themselves disgraced to have risen from my table and not counted glass to glass with me, who am an' old toper. There was a man, my young friend, and a wise one, who spoke thus: 'Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and thine often infirmi- ties.' His advice applies exactly to me, while that of another is most excellent for young men; he says, "ook not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his color in the cup, when. it moveth itself aright; at last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.' -Ah! it does, young man; and when I see young men with red eyes and muddled brains, I say to myself, ' Grumby's purse-strings shall never be untied for them, lest I, too, should help them down the- road to perdition.' " "You are right, my lord. I deserve no credit for my abstemiousness, I do not crave it. One glass will strengthen me; more would confuse me." ei   zlHESTER POWERS' GIBR;LOOD.    117 Since that day Markham  had not wanted for a friend. The old lord attached himself to him, intro- duced him to his friends, many of whom were patrons of art. They travelled to London together, and had not been there twenty-four hours before his lordship wrote down to "West Oakland,' to his friend, rela- tive to the portraits which Sir Huston had written him about. The result we have seen. Now our friend has returned to London, is back again in his gloomy ," chambers," and anxiously waiting the time to arrive when he should meet his kind friend and patron; so impatient was he that he was at the club-rooms fully an hour before the, time appointed by his lordship. There were only a few persons around at that early hour; a few over-dressed young men either reading the morning papers or lazily sipping a cup of coffee. Markham was not a frequent- er of such places; he was always too poor, too shab- by, and, in truth, cared very little about them. He was retiring, shrinking; therefore, felt awkwardly upon entering the saloon. Those already there could tell in a moment, by his manner, that he was not one of them. They looked at 'him, and then at each other, which brought the sensitive blood with a rush to his face, while he sat down and-nervously seized a paper. His eye had just rested-, on a paragraph headed, 'i Family Portraits," when his attention was engaged by the conversation of a pair of dandies who had just then :sauntered in, and had taken seats near him. 6"Deuced stwange!" said one, after having looked at a paper for a moment.

"Ah, ha! you could hardly find it in your heart to believe him capable of painting such pictures as these are said to be. How could -he have become known to the ' West Oakland' family? No-- no! It's some new fellow just from the studio of one of the grand masters; and we may expect, for a while at least, that the whole of London will be able to think of nothing else but the great artist; he will be hunted to death, and fabulous prices will be paid for just one daub of his brush. So the world goes!" Markham sat with his .eyes on his paper while his ears were intently listening to the above colloquy. He knew well who these young men were. They had once occupied chambers on the first floor of the St. George, and had made themselves particularly annoying to him in the times when he most desired to escape observa- tion. They had found out from the portress howr excessively poor he was, and had most contemptibly turned his poverty into ridicule. Since those days however, Markham had changed in appearance very much; he was stouter, and the sickly yellow of his   -EST9R?

And P now the young men were busy With muffin and mutton i chop he quietly commenced to read the elaborate description of his work, sent to the!"Times" by Sir Huston Falkstone himself. But before he had gottenm through the first sentence, he was again interrupted by an exclamation from his friends at the next table.

"How-de-do? how-de-do?" said the old gentleman, while his keen, twinkling little eyes run round the room. "Ah! yes, there you are, always in timei How-de-do, my dear fellow?" he exclaimed, while seizing Markham by the shoulder. "Didn't I tell you so? Seen what the ' Times' says? Pardon me, gentle- men, - my friend Markham, a splendid fellow, and a glorious artist."  X The two young men bowed, and gazed, and finally recognized the poor artist of the seventh story of the St. George. A few commonplace remarks followed, and then Lord Grumby, who never wasted minutes when he had business on; hand, drew his young friend's arm within his own, bowed and walked away, leaving the two to look after them.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7752-00000061"/> 120      "JUDGE NOT;"OR, "Well!" exclaimed Bob, " hif that haint deuced stwange I don't know what is!" "Just like that porpoise of a Grumby!" growled Bob's worthy friend. "Who but him would pick acquaintance with a fellow who but a year ago had but one meal a day, and that one of smoked sprats and stale bread! Bah! who cares for Grumby, gouty old dog! Come." They sauntered down the street, both secretly envying the fellow who was now having some- thing better to eat than smoked sprats. As to Grumby, he was beside himself with his soung friend's success; he feasted and trotted him every- where. He had made up his mind that Markham should become a great man in his profession. "Now," he said, as they found themselves at one of the hotel dinner-tables, " you must forthwith come out of those St. George chambers; you have been there too long, Henceforward let no man guess that your purse is empty, or that you need employment. Come out, - out of your shell; be bold, daring. Go into a fashion- able business location, and hang out your sign. Don't be afraid of spending a guinea or two, nor forget that Old G-rumby is your friend. By George, how well you look!" In less than three weeks, Markham's sign hung in a conspicuous place, outside the second-story rooms of a fine brown stone building, in a well-known business street, and already the "West Oakland" paintings were bringing him in orders. Lord Grumby, also, was working diligently for him, and Markham very soon began to feel easy under the comments of the press, as   HESTER POrWEiS9' GIRLHOOD.    - 121 well as in purse. He saw prosperity looming up be- fore him, and he looked forward to the time when he should no longer be lonely after the labors of the day were ended. The pretty little suburban home was * still in his mind.  Hester received from him regularly every week a long letter, in which he described his paintings, spoke of the future when they would never more be-parted; i  and in return he received letters neither remarkable for orthography, rhetoric, or style; but they were all he desired. They spoke the language of a true and gentle heart, breathing of hope, and that beautiful simplicity and earnest piety ever attractive and pleas- ing alike to stranger and friend. 1     .. i                    '   &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7752-00000062"/> CHAPTER X1 t. THE ROBBERY. THERE was a puzzled expression on Isabella's face, as she stood resting one elbow on her toilet. There was also a confused appearance around her boxes. Jewel-cases and drawers were standing open, and their contents jumbled together, as if she had been impatiently searching for something. "It is strange!" she said, pressing her hand upon her forehead, -- " very strange! I would sacrifice my life before I would be unjust, hasty, or unkind to you, Hester. The brilliant spray, I said nothing about to my parents; when it was restored; I forgave you, even tried, against my judgment, to believe you inno- cent. The ring went, but I said nothing. - But this, - this I cannot hide. It is too glaring a crime. O Hes- ter, you have proved unworthy of our love--our trust!" Isabella was pale, and in her eye there was a hard, fixed. determined look; a proud curl upon her lip, - just as her father would have appeared under the same circumstances. About' two hours before, Sir Huston had stood with 122   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD..    123  his daughter at the 'same toilet. He had been called off to London quite unexpectedly, and had come to Isabella's dressing-room to say good-by. While stand- ing at the toilet, he had opened a jewel-case, and tak- ing from it an exquisitely small and jewelled watch, said, "You wished me to touch the regulator, did you not, daughter?" "Yes, papa; the watch is so small and delicate that I would rather not attempt it myself." It had been made to order but a short time before, and Sir Huston had presented it to her on her seventeenth birthday. As he laid it on a velvet cushion on the toilet, he said, 1' The chain you shall have on my return. I will bring it down with me." In a few more minutes Sir Huston was galloping across the park. The air was delicious, and Isabella slipped out through the open window upon the balcony to watch him. While she was there she, saw Hester coming up the avenue. She was walking slowly, being apparently in deep thought. When near to the house, she stopped, con- sidered for a moment, and then walked out under the shade of the great oak. It was the first time she had voluntarily gone near it since the day when Isabella had found the diamond spray at her feet. Now she  seemed not to think of the unpleasant occurrence; she X , was interested in the busy clatter of the birds up in j:;7   the branches. While Isabella was watching her, she thought of it, and said to herself, "I wonder when the mystery will be cleared away." She went back to the room to meet Hester, whom she had just seen enter the  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7752-00000063"/> 124   '    JUDGE NOT; "OR, After the usual pleasant greeting, Hester threw off her little rustic hat, and was about to pass from the dressing-room into Miss FPalkstone's chamber, when she caught sight of the tiny little watch sparkling on its crimson cushion. She stepped back, looked at it, and said, "What a perfect thing it is!" Poor girl! Suddenly she recollected that in a similar way she had expressed herself about another gem just before it had been lost. The thought of it brought the blood rush- ing to the roots of her hair. Isabella noticed it, but said  nothing; and they went together into the chamber. '"Come, Hester," Isabella said, " let us have a good time and read. I have such an interesting book. We are almost entirely alone. Papa has gone to London for a' day or two, on business, and mamma is out, riding." "I am sorry it should happen so to dar," Hester said, thoughtfully, "because I cannot stay long." "Not stay!   Why?"Isabella asked, in a disap- pointed tone. "Father is quite poorly to-day, and not able to go to his work, and he asked me not to be away from him long. He   is not often sick, but when he is, he loves to have me by him to smoothe his head or read to him." "I am sorry he is not well, dear Hester, and, much as I should like you to remain with me, I could not ask you to neglect your father," Isabella said. Hester had been thinking while Isabella spoke,- thinking and listening, too. "Father," she said, " is   HESTER POrERS' GIRLHOOD.     125 only. a poor cottager, dear Isabella, - is not above his labor; he is happy and contented with his humble lot - and,' - the girl's face became radiant with love as she spoke,-  oh, he is such a good and noble man!" "Your parents will miss you, Hester, by and by." I "Oh, please don't speak of it! I cannot bear to think of leaving them. They have brought me up so tenderly; but, then, they will like to see me settled, for I am to have a pretty home, and they will come and stay with us. Isabella,"-she said, in a softer tone, - '"I shall be so very, very happy! - " They talked on thus for perhaps an hour, when Hester said, "I must go now; father is expecting me now, I am sure. Can I do anything for you before I go, dear Isabella?" 'Oh, no," she answered, kindly. "I shall not be lonely.' Sle held up her book playfully, and then added, "Roland will be back from the village soon, and mamma from her ride, and then we are to have company to dinner." They kissed each other, and parted at the dressing-room door. After which, Isa- bella returned to her chamber, threw herself upon a. divan, and settled- herself to read. Hardly had she composed herself, before a sort of- stealthy, rustling sound in her dressing-room aroused her. She looked up, and called, Roland! Hester! Is it you'?"  A second time she called; but there' came no answer. "It is the wind in the curtains," she thought, as she again turned to her book, and had read a page, when the same sound attracted her attention. It seemed to her like the rustle of dress and a stealthy step. Again  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7752-00000064"/> 126       EJUDGE NOT;," OR, she called; but there came no answer. She threw down her book, -and stepped out quickly into her dressing-room. There was no one there! She went to the door, and looked down through the lolig corridor. To her amazement shefaw, or thought she saw, Hes- ter, only then about to\turn down the stairway. No one else was to be seen .The servants at that hour were rarely in that part of the building, excepting those in attendance upon the ladies. Rather a-strange feeling came over Isabella, and she wondered for what' Hester had returned, and why she had not answered her call. To satisfy herself that it really was Hester she had seen, she stepped out again upon the balcony.  She was not mistaken. It was Hester I Isabella stood leaning against a pillar, looking after her friend. The old gardener, too, leaned upon his rake and watched the girl as she slowly walked away. Something seemed to have attracted her, and,instead of going directly homeward, she had taken a, rather circuitous route. Isabella was more puzzled than before; she went back into her dressing-room, saying to herself, aloud, "Hester does so curiously some- times." Passing the toilet-table, she turned to look at her little watch, --it was not there! It was gone!" Not here! gone! gone!" she exclaimed. , What does it mean?"The color forsook her very lips, and with a trembling hand she pulled forth boxes and drawers, and rummaged their contents, knowing all the while   rrESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     127 that but a short time before it was ticking away upon its crimson cushion on the toilet. SuSpicion, ah, cruel thing! it came back upon her with tenfold power, but with it for a little while there came pain, - sor0row; for Isabella loved her friend. But as conviction strengthened itself, the sorrow passed away, and was succeeded by a proud, determined, un- flinching look. Isabella was prepared to act out what she considered her duty to the letter. "The matter shall now be sifted!" she said. "I will no longer be a partner in guilt, by keeping the knowledge of crime locked in my breast."  Her figure was drawn up, and, as she paced up and down the room, there was neither pity nor leniency on her countenance. Her nature was like her father's; she felt within her deepest heart that her friend was guilty of crime, and for that crime must suffer the penalty.             - "Twice, twice," said Isabella, u' have I shielded her from shame, disgrace; and though feeling, knowing her to be guilty, I have still kept her a cherished friend in, my heart."  Very pale, very erect was Isabella in her indigna- tion. "From this moment I will banish you forever from my heart. I have trusted,--you deceived.; I have shielded,--you have robbed me. O Hester! Hester! Had mine enemy done me this wrong, I could have borne it; but you, Hester, you, mine own familiar friend! Oh, how could you dishonor yourself so much?  How could you bring disgrace and sorrow upon your poor old parents?"  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7752-00000065"/> *128      "JUDGE NOT; "OR, Again for a moment her hand was pressed upon  her brow, and, while standing thus, Roland came in. l'My young lady," said the woman, looking wildly at the confused toilet and then upon the expression of the young lady's face, " what 'as 'appened?" "Close the. door, Roland. My little watch has been - stolen."       ' Stolen, my lady? ,  '  "Stolen!" repeated Isabella, sternly. "Ah! my lady," said Roland, while her, exultant i heart gave a leap, "I've 'ad my hies about -me hever since the hother affair; an' hif I'd 'ad a right, ma'am, * but then I 'adn't, and so kept things to meself, - I should have sot you on your guard; for I couldn't 'elp thinking that 'twasn't wisd in a lady like you, ma'am,:  to make a bosom-friend and companion of a maid born in low life, like- like her."          .?

"Which way did you return from the village, Ro- land?"Isabella asked..

I didn't speak, though she did; she said, in her purtiest tone, ' Good-morning, Roland; isn't it a nice day?'" "Silly girl!" Isabella said, turning away, for she felt half ashamed of having held so long a conversa- tion on such a subject with her maid. "Roland," she said, turning round quickly, "I de- sire that you will say nothing about this in the house; by talking sometimes one is apt to fall into trouble; arrange this toilet, and, when Lady Falkstone comes in, say that I would like it if she could come to me in my chamber." Isabella shut herself in her room. She found it hard, even now, to tear from her heart one whom she had so, long loved with the, deepest and tenderest af- fection; she fell upon her knees and buried her face in her hands, asking, in broken and tearful sentences, for guidance in this most singular and trying circum- stance. Hurriedly Roland arranged the toilet,. and noiselessly did she fly below stairs; her heart was brim full, and things were turning out just exactly as she had pre- dicted. She found Grieves up to " 'er hies " in busi- ness, looking over her laady's wardrobe.

Lady Falkstone had that moment come in from her ride, and was still in, her closely fitting habit when Roland entered the room. Never had she appeared more beautiful than now when she turned to meet the woman. Her face flushed with exercise, and her large eyes sparkled with good-humor and health. "Is Grieves not about?" she inquired, pleasantly. '"She is, my lady; but Miss Falkstone desired me to say that she would like to see you, my lady, before the guests arrived." "Where is Miss Falkstone?" the lady asked, some- what surprised. At that moment Isabella came into her mother's room. She was distressed; she had been calmly think- ing of what must follow, and she was suffering for      : Hester. Her eyes were red and swollen, and her hair was pushed baclk from her forehead in a disordered way. "In mercy's name, child!" exclaimed Lady Falk- stone, "what is the matter? Has -has any accident happened to your father?" she almost gasped. Roland left them, and closed the door after her. "Isabella, speakto me!" said the lady again, for the girl's tears were choking her words.         ' "( Nothing has happened to papa," she said i " only bear with me a moment, dear mamma, and I will tell you." They sat side by side on a low couch, arid Isabella leaned her head on her mother's shoulder, while she entered into all the particulars of the lost jewelry.  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7752-00000067"/> 132   "    JrTDGE NOT; "OR, ' "Mamma what are we to think?" she asked, when all had been told. "Think! repeated Lady Falkstone, bitterly; " onlyv that we have been most wickedly deceived."  Had Hester not gained heretofore so warm a place  in their hearts, they would not now have felt so bit- - terly toward her; had they not loved her, the robbery  would have cost them no suffering. They had taken   her into their hearts and loved her, had ministered lto  her comfort, happiness, in every way, and even then  Sir Huston was absolutely making arrangements to  endow her with a comfortable wedding portion. These thoughts made her crime appear to them of a darker, blacker character, and determined them at once to put  from them forever a name which would henceforth be  branded with shame and crime. Lady Falkstone's proud nature rose up in all its strength, and Isabella sat shivering to think of what must inevitably be the fate of her recent friend. "Isabella!" said Lady Falkstone, sternly, " rouse . yourself. Would you sit and lament over one so ut- terly unworthy even ,of your pity? Would you take back to your heart ad viper that already has thrice stung you?- Remember!" and the lady's lofty form , became more erect, her face more stern. :I Remem- ber that, her crime will bring your name before the  world'!

The day waxed, on., Guests came and departed.   BEPSTER POFEoSEn  GIRZLHOOD.   133 There was music, and smiling faces, too, while yet a dark shadow rested over the "' West Oakland" house. The theft was no longer a secret'; and servants talked -in groups, wondering what would be done in the mat- ter when the master should return. Mr. Rubens, poor old man, had nothing to say at first. He wiped the drops from his ruddy face, - ay, and a little moisture from the corner of his eye, while his kind and tender heart went out in a prayer for the guilty one. "If she be guilty, -if she be, I say," he said aloud, - a" the Lord be merciful to her; for she be in hard, stern hands, and oh! I do feel afeared that the law will be upon 'er. Temptation! oh! it be a hard thing for us all to resist. Bat, blessed Lord, be with the poor lamb; heir friends will forsake her now, - but don't thee!"He turned his face away from those who were ready, as it were, to fleece the "Iamb," and wept. The old man's breast heaved, and the big round tears ran down his wrinkled cheeks. Since noon, Hester had been sitting by her father's side in the best room of the cottage. Nancy was there, too, busy as usual with her needle, after the little 1jobs about the ,place" were done up. Simon had been very poorly during thie first part- of the day; but having been well dosed with the never-failing "yarb tea," he felt better, and was glad to have Hester iead to him a little. Everything around, both in-doors and out, looked so sweet, so peaceful to the girl, - she was very happy! As she had passed through the vil- lage on her way to "West Oakland," in the morning, she had called at the post-.office, and received her e   &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7752-00000068"/> -134 :      JUDGE NOT; "OR, weekly letter from Markham. It was longer, more earnest, and of deeper interest than usual; and as Hester sat by her father, she could not help thinking about it; and now -and then she spoke of it to him.   "He is going to be rich, father," she said, '" and jyou. and mother are to live with us in our pretty home. And we both will do so much for you, and then you shall not work so hard in the sun, and the cold, and the rain."-  "God bless thee, my child!" said the old man, as he pressed her soft little hand within his own, or twisted one of her pretty curls around his rough fingers. "God bless thee! but, Hester, thee hair won't be seemly like this, when ye be a married woman; ye'll have to tuck it up,- tuck it up, child, like the .rest o' 'em; for by and by ye'll be a dandling the wee ones on yer knee, and a wearing o' caps like yer mother did before ye.

The old man wBas pointing, through the open doorway, out into the pretty garden, where the rose-bushes almost made a hedge around, and which were covered thick with buds and flowers. Then there were the gay tulips, and dahas, and wall- flowers, and double daisies all around upon the beds; and the honeysuckle had called out the bees, and their  pleasant buzz came into the cottage like music. Even old puss, as she enjoyed the sunshine on the porch, seemed happier than usual. Ah!X around that pretty cottage there seemed to be a sort of holy, peaceful calm,--that calm which bodes the, comingt    NESTER POWERS' GIaRLHOOD.      135 storm. The twilight came, and then the stars, and still the dove of peace lingered with outstretched pin-  ions. Did he dread to fold them? The candles were lighted and put upon the table, and Hester read aloud to them. "Now put up your book, and read a chapter in the Bible, me darlin'." Hester's rich voice and earnest .manner touched the hearts of both father and mother, and, as she closed, Simon caught up the spirit, and in a simple, fervent prayer, asked God's blessing on all present and ab-  sent. A holy calm, a lofty Christian resignation, settled upon this loving household as they separated for the night. "          .  .

The hills caught up the sounds, and the echoes an.- swered in low, sweet tones. The children sitting in the cottage doorways sang merrily with the birds, until by and by they were made ready for Sunday school, and hand in hand they went on, talking per- chance of their dresses or ribbons, childlike. Hester and Grace were not scholars now; they each taught a class, and they very soon followed the chil- dren. It was a pretty sight,--teachers and scholars, alike, summoned by the bells, were seen walking slowly up the avenues of that old church-yard, where the tall grass waved over the lowly graves of the departed. seldomr did levity appear in its precincts. There was something about it so solemn that all alike were in- spired with a feeling of awe.  As Hester catechised her class that Sabbath morn- ing, the rector of the church stood by her side. He had been always exceedingly fond of her, and consid- ered her a most exemplary young Christian,-- a pat- tern in the church. This morning as the school was  136 --'.-..   H zEST'ER POWERS GIRZLHOOD.    137 dismissed, he took her hand between his own, and said, "Hester, your little class will miss you; but I trust the little seeds you have dropped by the way will spring up with blessing by and by. May the Lord ever keep you in his love, my child!" He went into the vestry-room, and Hester to her pew  in the church. .Only a very few persons were there. All was quiet and solemn. The subdued light coming in through the stained windows threw around the sacred chamber a sort of mysterious sgl'ctity; and Hester felt her thoughts ascend upward to the " temple not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." The congregation at length gathered; and Hester, as usual, looked for the Falkstones, for Isabella never failed to give her a smile as she passed to her pew. To-day there was no smile for Hester. Isabella and Lady Falkstone had passed proudly by, venturing not a single look toward the expectant girl. The service opened with the solemn words, "Enter not into judg- ment with thy servant, O' Lord. For in thy sight shall no man living be justified." Hester saw in -a moment that Isabella did not as usual participate in the service; she kept her seat. Just her head was vis- l ible above the pew. Hester became anxious, feeling afraid that her-friend was not well; and she really wished for one look at her face. But Miss Falkstone did not turn, or seem to move, until the hymn had been concluded, and the text chosen for, the sermon" had been 'read slowly by the rector. It was a strange passage, and it fell strangely upon the ears of a few* at least, of those present. "With me, it is a very  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7752-00000070"/> 138      "JUDGE NOT; " oR, small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment; yea, I judge not mine own self. For I know nothing by myself, yet am I not hereby'justified, but he that judgeth me is the Lord." s"How singular!" thought Isabella, as she 'turned for an instant to look at Hester, to discover, if possible, for what purpose such a passage had been chosen; but Hester's eyes and thoughts were also fixed upon the rector's face, wile a second time he repeated the text, and Isabella saw nothings more than a quiet, earnest expression; a face indi tive of purity,--not crime. All through the service iewter felt strangely. She could not account for her feelings; and as soon as the service was over, she went out into the pbrch, for there she generally joined her friend for a few mo- ments before going homeward; but, to het utmost astonishment, the ladies of "West Oaklland" did not deign her a single look as they swept haughtily by. She looked after them with a vague, strange pain at her heart, while they walked down the cedar avenue, and until the carriage had rolled away from the entrance-gate of the church-yard. Twice Grace had touched her, but there seemed to be no feeling left in her flesh. "Hester,- Hester, don't stand here! See how the people are looking at you. Come," said Grace. And Hester tried to walk, but her limbs seemed powerless. "Grace," she said, at length, "why did they act so strangely? Why did Roland and others look at me, so?"She looked into her friend's face with a strange, wondering look.   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     139 ,' Don't talk here, Hester; try to come now; com- pose yourself, and we will talk it over by-and-by." They did go home, but Hester's heart was heavy, and her face looked sad, perplexed. She tried very hard- to be bright as usual; but oh! it was a relief in- deed' when she could be alone in the quiet of her own little chamber. Sunday as it was she wrote a few lines to Isabella, asking, in her own simple and affec- tionate way, to know in what way she had offended her. Simon did not know the contents, or guess his daughter's feelings; he said that he was going, out for a stroll by and by, and wouldn't mind walking to 4"West Oakland ", with it himself. So he put the note into the pocket of his big red plush vest, and Hester stood at the garden-gate watching him as he walked over the hill. Anxiously, very anxiously, did she wait for his re- turn, and her heart beat almost audibly when he appeared in sight. "Hester," he said, as he sat down in his own chair, "Hester, child, there be some'ot up; there's a sompin goin' of yonder hat the 'all." "Why, father? What sort of something?"Hester asked, growingd somewhat pale. "Well, I couldn't get nothing out o' nobody, child.

"Well, child, ye'll soon quit there altogether, an' hif trouble be made, why ye must just bear it quietly. But mind ye, I be poor and old, but I ben't going to be trifled with. Rubens told me months ago that ye had some enemies around ye in the women-folk, who was jealous of ye. Now hif they have gone and made real trouble for ye, old as I be, they shall know that there be a law hin the land for the poor man as well as the rich. I have often told ye, child, that no honester folk than the Powers' ever lived. Not one of 'em got a stain upon his name, and not one of 'em ever wronged another out o' a farthen!" The old man was growing excited, and Hester laid her hand quietly upon his arm. ,' Father," she said, "what shall harm us if we be followers of that which is good? There is no one in the world able to bring me into real trouble. Some may talk and make mischief, and even that would soon pass-over, for I have never injured any one in my life." "The world be a cruel onei" said the old man, ' an' there be- thousands hin it alway ready to put their heels upon the necks o' the weak. Haint hit said 'trust not in an harm o' flesh'? - Yes, child! and ye'll find out before ye die that a body's friends be as spiders' webs in the day o' trouble." "Well-a-day, Simon, haint ye a done preaching yet?    RESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     141 Do talk sense as ye most times do! Whose going to 'arm us or the girl?" said Nancy, giving a few more nervous touches to the little tea-table. "Come, let's have tea. This mornin' before church-time I went hout a rootin' among the beds, hand I picked nigh upon a pint an a 'alf of strawherries. Bless me, Simon, can't ye be yerself?" "Oh, yes, father!"Hester said, kissing his brow; "cheer up, let's be' happy while we may.'" '"Ye be a blessed child!" the old man said, as they took their seats around the tea-table. Depressed as Hester felt, she tried very hard to be outwardly cheerful; though every little while her thoughts would run upon Isabella's strange behavior in the morning. he thought, too, of the diamond spray, and the gipsy's words came again in her ears; and she felt Very glad when night came, for she said perhaps to-morrow things will look brighter. But alas! she only slept to dream of painful things. i Once, she thought that a hungry wolf was hunting her as the hounds did -he poor fox, and she cried out in her suffering, "Father, save me! save me!"But it was a dream! only a dream! Nevertheless the terror she endured then clung to her in her waking hours. It seemed hard for her to keep up, yet she took her sew-, ing and sat down in the window-bench, and tried to be cheerful. Sometimes her work lay in her lap, and there rose up a feeling of pride within her. "I am en- titled to common courtesy at least," she thought. "If I have offended Isabella, she should be willing to tell me how." She turned her head to look. out of the   &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7752-00000072"/> "2      "JUDGE NOT;" t OR, window, for some one was opening the garden-gate. It was old Mr. Rubens! Hester did not wait a second, but flew with a beat- ing heart to meet him. "O Mr. Rubens!" she said, "I am so glad to see you. What has happened at the Hall?" "Happened?" the old man repeated the word, while he looked down upon the sweet face that was looking up into his so unconscious of evil. ' I be in- structed to give ye this, poor child!" he said, C" and may the Holy Father above help thee!" Hester's face grew very- white, white as the pale lilies on her garden-bed, and Rubens turned to go away. "Don't go! don't go!" she almost shrieked, as she grasped his hand, and the dread of some fearful evil smote upon her heart. "Oh! I will not, cannot let you go until I know what it is! What has hap- pened T f "' Child, child," said the old man, E ye shall never 'ear it from my lips. All Old Rubens can say is this. 'Be ye strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.' Don't ye sink, little one; he will carry thee in his bosom and lay his everlasting arms under thee young head; so don't ye break down, -he won't for- sake thee." There was a pause then, for Rubens' voice had be- come choked. "Read the paper, child," he said, at length*; and Hester opened it. It read thus, -                .

It would occupy too much space to give in full the feelings of the inmates of that little cottage, as the -morning wore away, - of the contending emotions in the parents' breasts as they vainly endeavored to unravel the mystery. The twelve o'clock dinner remained un- tasted, and then the father and daughter, dreading they knew not what, walked away silently and slowly toward the ' Wjest Oakland" mansion,  Its turrets 2 glowing in sunlight, and rising grandly from out thick foliage, did not now attract Hester's gaze; she only saw her father's sad face. As they drew near to it, many were watching for them; some with feelings of pain, and others with a sort of morbid satisfaction, as they whispered to each other, "Nothing more than I expected. :I thought she'd turn out so with all her soft ways and purty words," and the like. How strange it seemed to Hester not to run up the broad flight of granite steps as usual! Now, even when she beheld them, the strength seemed to forsake her limbs, -and her heart beat with a strange and pain- ful oppression. Mr. Rubens met them in his kind, polite way; but there was sadness in his smile, a sort of tender pity in the way he shook their hands. He led them forth- with up to the library. As he bowed himself out, and closed the door, Sir Huston Falkstone turned his  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7752-00000073"/> "4      "-JUDGE NOT; "OR, now cold, stern face toward the two who were standing side by side near the door. Hester moved slightly for- ward as his hard, unfriendly eye met hers. She was as colorless as the marble busts beside which she stood. With alarm stamped on every feature, she looked up into her father's face. There was no look of fear on it, but a proud, almost defiant expression. "Ye had the pleasure to send for us, yer honor," be- gan the old man, in a tone partaking as much of pride as did his look. Sir Huston wheeled himself round, fixed those same cold, forbidding eyes first on one, and then the other, in silence, for a few seconds, and then, in a slow, deliber- ate tone, said, "I did; and it is with regret, for we have business of a most unpleasant character to look into." "That is bad," said Simon, still wearing the same undaunted look. "It is," said Sir Huston, bitterly. "I could say very much which would perhaps be superfluous now, relative to the manner in which our confidence, our generosity,' and kindness have been abused; of the deep, and subtle character of a girl so young as she who now stands be- fore me, - she who would fain have covered her crimes by a fair, and outwardly consistent piety. All this, however, I must lay aside. To be brief, on Christmas morning last, a costly brilliant spray was stolen from my daughter's toilet."' Hester leaned against her father's side for:support, for a faintness had come over her, almost depriving her of sight and strength.   HESTER POWERS' GIrRL1OOD.     145 --"This jewel, however, was restored a week after ina a rather singular way. You, perhaps, remember the circumstance," the gentleman said, looking at Hester. She bowed her head in assents and he continued: "Although Miss Falkstone was even then convinced of your daughter's guilt, in compassion for one w]om she had blindly made her friend and companion, she generously kept it a secret. No sooner had, the matter been apparently forgotten, than a valuable ring, set with rubies, next disappeared; soon after that, a little emerald brooch, and, on Saturday morning, a very small and costly watch. Now," said Sir Huston, " sad as it is to us all, we feel that so glaring a crime must be dealt with sternly. Justice must take its course." "What! what can you mean?"Hester cried, in a wild, unnatural voice. "'Can you mean- that I am guilty of these!crimes?"  "I do. The proofs of your guilt are indisputable, positive!" "Sir!" interrupted Simon, "do you say that my child, -that Hester Powers did steal those things?" "I do." "Mark me, sir, so wicked an accusation can't be brought ag'in 'er quietly! This trembling child be pure from hit before 'eaven. Can ye lend yourself to so foul a purpose? Could ye find it in yer 'eart to rob 'er?" and the old man pointed to the girl, clinging, clinging wildly to him, "O man! for ye be no more, wid ye plunge usi honest folk, into wretchedness 'and dis- grace?

In her despair and anguish, the girl had fallen, and was clasping her fa- ther's knees; her eyes were dry and dilated, and two crimson spots burned upon her cheeks. "Hester!" The old man spoke once more in a deep and suffering tone, as he kneeled by her, and tenderly laid her head upon his breast. "Hester, dear, 'tis yert father, -yer father, child; he'll protect ye!" The girl clung to him more tightly, and the old man carried her from the room. Many were peeping, but only Old Rubens came for- ward to help them in their suffering. He helped to support the poor girl, and brought water, and then whispered kind and Christian words' into Simon's ear. "Ah!" he said, while he, wrung his hands,!" there is One above that knoweth- all things; man doeth judge by outside looks, God by the heart; and though things do look agin 'er, I wid ha'e me old 'eart pulled out , \    HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     147 afore I wid condemn 'er. God hae mercy on the lamb!"     - It was ilong before Hester was able to leave the house, and when she did, she had but little power to walk. As they went slowly homeward, resting every little while under the hedges, the father and daughter did not tell each other what they were suffering. Nancy alone, when she heard the sad tale, indulged in words and tears; she almost raved. She plied Hester with useless questions; but the girl could only answer, "Mother, I am not guilty,-I am not guilty!'"         ' Such an affair was not long in reaching the village. It flew from house to house, gathering in volume as it went. "Ah, ha! and so hit's come to this, so soon!" cried one woman, bursting breathlessly into Grace Homes's cottage. "I never believed the gal could stand bein' made a lady o' very long; but I did believe 'er honest! Better them Powerses 'ad done by 'er as I did by my Jemima, -jest a put 'er to the wash-tub, or bound 'er hout." "Why, what is the fuss?" inquired Martha Homes. And forthwith the tale was told. Grace stood like a statue, listening. She-remembered how the ladies had swept by, in the church-porch, on the day before, and other things came flashing across her mind.; but she felt that Hester was unjustly accused, and because she had said that no good would result from such an in- timacy, she did not begin to jeer and condemn l          ! -  .  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7752-00000075"/> "8      "JUDGE NOT'; " oR, her friend; no, Grace's heart was stirred to its deep- est fountains with sorrow and anger. "Hush!" she said, as the neighbors talked; " don't add to the poor girl's troubles; you know, in your hearts, that she would have died a thousand deaths before she would steal!" Her feet scarce touched the ground as she flew up the hill to Hester's home; and she soon discovered that the cottage gatr den was filled with people, some anx- ious, others only curious. -Boys and girls stretched their necks over the wooden railings; men leaned against the trees and talked, while women crowded and pushed and chattered, caring little that they were crushing under their feet the pretty flowers Hester had planted and so dearly loved. Alas! who could be considerate for flowers, then? Such another excite- ment had not been in Oakland for many a long year. But Grace pushed her way into the porch, and looked into the " best room;" for a hman with a badge stood at the door to keep the crowd out. "Let me in, -please let me in, sir," plead Grace, "I am Hester's friend; we always played together. Won't you let me pass?" "Let 'er come in," said a feeble voice from the far- ther end of the room. And then poor old Simon tot- tered forward to meet her. "Grace," he said, "I thort ye wid come. I was sure ye widn't forsake the poor thing in her trouble." And then his breast heaved and his voice was lost. Grace looked round and saw that Hester was ly- ing on the settle, with her head resting on her mother's   HESTER PO;WE'PS' GIRHOOD.     149 lap; her face was deathly pale, and her eyelids closed.  '"It will kill her!" said Grace, starting back. "Oh, shei is dying now!" But there came a smile to Hester's lips, and she opened her hand to receive her friend's. "Grace," she whispered, "I am not guilty; I shall receive strength from above." Turning to Nancy, Grace asked, "What are those two men doinmin the other room?" "Doing!" said -Nancy, bitterly, " they be officers, child; they be rummaging the place, - hivery hole and corner hin hit, an' a fine time I shill have o' gettin the place to rights again,-but for all they'll find they might rummage till doomsday." Simon rocked himself -back and forth- in his chair, and kept his eyes fixed anxiously upon his child. ", Hester," said Grace, in a low tone, ' don't take on so; things will come out right in the end. Your friends don't believe a word of it." But there came a sound from the little room, - Hes- ter's room; then, a sort of triumphant sound, and the words, "This is plenty to fix her; 'tis a pity though for a gal so likely, but this is one of the- things an' no mistake!" Hester shivered as the remark came to her ear, and the burning flush, which had for a while forsaken her cheek, suddenly returned. Simon, his wife, and Grace hurried to ascertain what had been found, and one of the offiders held up the emnerald brooch! They had found it hidden in an inner pocket of a dress occasion- i      -                 * .. .  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7752-00000076"/> 150      "JUDGE NOT;"OR, ally worn by Hester, wrapped in articles seldom used and by her wholly forgotten.  "Tis a sorry thing," the man said as he looked at the blanched faces before him. "It must be purty 'ard for you, old man ; but it seems a wonder to me that you didn't call to mind how 'ard 'tis for older folks to stand temptation, and how could she, a sprightly gal just going to step up a peg or two, by marrying a well- to-do Londoner? 'Tis a pity, but there's more blame to you, than 'er." "Don't stand a preachin' to us," called Nancy; "I'd sooner believe that one of you put the bauble in the dress than my gal ; hifye was sent 'ere to do the biddin' o' the law, do hit and begone; and hif ye think that - " "Hush, wife," said Simon; "the lawhe a 'ard master, and if we be so unfortunate to be under hit, 'tis best to be quiet and peaceful ;-by prattling so it may only go the 'arder Wey the' poor child." All this time Hester, had scarcely moved, yet she comprehended all that was going on; and by and by, when the house had been thoroughly searched, and the two officers left the cottage, she raised herself up and said, "Is it all over now, father?"But seeing the man still keeping the door, and catching a glimpse of the crowd without, some of whom were even looking through the window, she fell back apparently more prostrated than before. "'Father!" The word, though faintly spoken, reached the old man's ears. "I'm 'ere close to ye, my child," he said. ' Father, pray for me - pray--it seems too much   HESTER POWERS' GIRIMHOOD.      151 to bear. I am innocent, father,--innocent about the brooch,! too, that they found." "We know hit, child, we hall know it. Take com- fort, for the ' bruised reed he will not break. Trust in the Lord, and he will strengthen thee.'" Hester slid from the settle, and kneeled between her parents, while in faltering voice the old man petitioned for his child. The day was passing, - four-- five o'clock had struck,but -the officer still kept his post at the door, while Simon, his wife, and Grace sat by the accused. No one spoke- and the old clock in the corner kept up its perpetual tick-tack, tick-tack. Suddenly the stillness was broken. The two officers who had searched the house  again appeared at the cot- tage door. Hester again shivered, but did not unclose her eyes, as she heard their voices and the increased din with- out. ! "We are authorized to take the girl with us," said one of the men. "Take 'er! Take Hester, me only child!" shrieked the poor old man. "In God's name--in mercy leave her to us. Men, men, where be yer hearts -to rob an old -man so?" "'Ti s a painful duty we have to fulfil," said one of the two. "We would gladly let her stay; but the'law --the law, old man, we be obliged to conform to hit." "Father," Hester said, rising and throwing her arms arousad his neck, " let them take me, let them take me. Be comforted with 'the assurance of my inno- ^      .

She kissed his trembling lips, and laid her burning cheek upon his brow; then she embraced her mother and Grace, whispering, "Pray, pray for me," - and then looking up, she said in a calm voice to the officers, "I am ready." The scene was too much for the poor old man; he fell back senseless as he saw his only child led away between the officers. The crowd moved back, and a murmui of sorrow and pity arose. At the corner of the garden the jail van waited to receive her, and the men placed her even tenderly into it; for, hard as their hearts were under some circum- stances, they were touched now. The jail was on the outskirts of the next town, which was about three miles distant from the village of Oak- land. The shadows were deepening over the land- scape as the van halted at the prison-gate. Hester heard the clank of keys, and the creaking of the heavy iron gate as it opened to admit her; but, to all out- ward appearance, she was dead to every sight, every sound. They almost carried her through the' gloomy passages to the cell, and then she said to the turnkey, who stood looking at her, full of compassion, "Can I rest now upon that little bed?" 'Why, to be sure you can, poor thing. This don't seem a fit place for the like o' you. What have they sent you here for, hey?" But Hester could not answer, and he continued,"'. I'm on the rounds three times in every twenty-four hours,   HESTEI POWTERS' GIRLHOOD.    153 and don't be afeared to speak out if you want any- thing. tI feels bad to see a young thing like you here, for I've got a gal just your size to hornm'." He made a few more remarks, and then went out, turned the key in the lock, and Hester was left alone in the prison cell.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7752-00000078"/> CHAPTER XV. ]I3ARKTTAM[XS BRIDE OF AN HOUR. ERNEST MARKHAM   had given the last finishing touches to a picture, and, with palette still on his thumb, walked back to the opposite wall to study it. "That's it!" he said, with satisfaction; "at last I have pro- duced the effect I desired; I am glad!" The noise of the rattling vehicles in the broad thor- oughfare without. had prevented the artist from hearing a heavy shuffling tread upon the stairs. - In fact he had been so absorbed in his picture that even the sounds in the street he had not heard; he was not aware that any one was near him, until Lord Grumby slapped him upon the shoulder, exclaiming, "You've hit it again, my boy!" '"Pardon me, my lord, but I believe it was you who dealt the blow," Markham said, almost springing off the floor. "Ha! ha! ha!" "I didn't hear a sound," said Markham;- " but I'm glad to see you out, my lord; would have been. up to see you, but have been run down with business." "Yes, yes," said his lordship, "I understood it. 154   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     155 Young men should never neglect business to play with their friends.

'Diet!, diet!' why a man might be as well dead, if he can't eat.' "I think-I should be willing to try it," said Mark- ham.  "Try it:! bless my soul, man, I should think you had tried it, and were sufficiently disgusted, too. But you say business is brisk, flourishing, hey? Glad of it," said the old gentleman casting his eyes around the room; " enough on hand to keep you busy for a year, I should say. Some difference now and when you were poked away in the top story of the St. George!

"Yes," said Markham, " there is plenty of it, and but vary few are fortunate enough to meet with a Grumby to ive them a pull out of the mud." "Tut, tut, man! Grumby may be well enough in his odd way, -a gouty old dog to be sure, --can't live for- ever, nor carry his purse with him through what the church people call the ' dark valley ;' so when he meets a struggling, honest boy, battling alone without a six- pence to call his own, where's the odds? and what's the glory if he holds out his hand, and says, ' Come, I'll give you a push'?

"They will," said M1arkham, looking almost rever- entially up into his face. "By the by," said Lord Grumby, " when did you hear from below, -' West Oakland,' I mean." "I have not heard for some time," Markham answered with some reluctance. No, he had not heard from Hester for nearly two weeks, and, strange to say, had scarcely looked at a paper, he had been so busy. "Then," said Lord Grumby, " you know nothing of the affair that has made, or rather is making, such a stir. 'The papers this morning are full of it." "Why, no! What affair?"Markham asked. "From what I can see, it is a pretty bad affair, and will go hard with the girl." "What girl?"Markham began to feel strangely. "There's been a robbery of jewelry at 'West Oakland.'" "A robbery!" "Ay! and committed, too, by a girl whom Miss Falkstone had made a companion and friend of. This girl was to have been married, and was anxious to supply herself with befitting ornaments for the occa- sion, it is thought, undoubtedly thinking that the blame would be thrown upon the servants, but-" he looked   HESTER POWERS GIRLHOOD.      157 into Markham's face-"Why! why, Markham,    my dear fellow, what's the matter?" But the young man had no power to answer; his hands rested on his knees, while an ashy pallor came over his face. Lord Glrumby came to his side. "My dear fellow," he said, Upon my honor,' H-I--I did not think the affair would in any way touch you. Was it to that girl that - that-" "If it is Hester Powers," said Markham, drawing a heavy inspiration, " she was my promised bride.", ' Great God!" exclaimed Grumby;  ' how could you--" ' : My lord,"' said Markham, "there is treachery there; that girl could not think a sin, much less act one. Steal! rob her friend! as soon would an angel have descended from the sky for so foul a purpose, as for Hester Powers to have conceived of such a deed." "Alas! my young friend, the,smooth, fair surface has sometimes a deep, dark, secret current below. In this world outside appearances should go for very little."  "Where is she?" inquired Markham, having heard but little of his- friend's last remarks. "Where? why, in jail, my dear fellow."  In jail!" the young man almost hissed the word. "Prison!- they shall rue it who had hearts'black enough to put her there! By the heaven above me they shall repent so foul a deed!"

"If all the jewels lost had been found among them, it would be no proof of her guilt to me. There is foul play, - foul play there!"While Markham had been speaking he had also been busy changing his coat and boots, smoothing his hair, and hurriedly covering up some of his work. "Why! where are you   going?" inquired his lordship, as the artist seized his hat. "Going? Pardon me, my lord,--but there is no time to talk longer, there are yet ten minutes before the down train starts, I can reach it if--if--" ' And are you going, like a madman, to thrust your- self in such a disgraceful thing, mix yourself up in- in-? Why, man, consider your reputation." "Reputation!" said Markham, bitterly, II I'd risk it, and my soul, too, upon her innocence. Good-by, my lord!"The last few words had been spoken out upon the landing; Markham had locked his studio, thrust the key into his pocket, and without another word ran down the stairs, leaving Grumby to act and think as he chose. He sprang into a cab, which fortunately hap- pened to be near the building, and was at the station in time to go down in the five-thirty train. Swiftly as the train flew on, it was not fast enough for his troubled and impatient spirit. The few hours involved in reaching "West Oakland" seemed to him like an eternity. The evening was advanced when he arrived at the lodge-gate, and it was some time before he could rouse   i  A   - ESTBB POWE RS' GIRLHOOD.    159 the old man, for he had fallen asleep over his beer; but at length he was awaked, and Markham found him- self approaching the mansion. With a firm hand he grasped the knob, and the great hall-bell sounded through every corner of the building. As he stood there impatiently waiting and looking into the dimly lighted place, it seemed to wear a solemn, gloomy, almost a forbidding air; scarcely a sound came forth from the gorgeous chambers to tell of happy or joyous spirits. "The Lord bless thee, sir," said Old Rubens, as he came forward and recognized the young man; " have ye come to look after the poor child?" "I have," said Markham. "Rubens, tell me what you can." "Ah! my dear sir, it, be a sad thing, -a sad thing, and the hull thing be a' rolled hup in mystery, which the Lord above can alone unfold. 'Tis dark;- very dark, but he who knoweth all things will some day make. it clear to our blind eyes. 'Tis my belief that, much as it do look agin 'er, she be clear 'o the sin."

"-I came here to see him," Markham said. "Then I'll say that you are 'ere, sir.- The affair have made the place purty gloomy, sir."  Rubens walked away; but returned soon, saying, that Sir Hus- ton would'see him in the library. The gentlemen bowed gravely to each other.

The painful sub- ject was at once broached; and after some lengthy remarks on the part of Sir Huston, Markham said, - "And could you, Sir Huston Falkstone, commit her to a jail, with no stronger proof of guilt than' merely finding one of the jewels?" "What stronger proof is required?  The girl's guilt, I regret to say, is positive; and we have all been alike painfully deceived. Would it not be well for you to keep yourself free from such an affair? I should think-" Sir Huston!" said Markham, looking the gentle- man full in the face, "do you take me for a'coward, sir, to shrink, skulk away, and leave the poor girl to bear this false and wicked accusation alone, merely to save my own name from publicity? No, sir! If she ever needed a friend, it is now. Hester Powers is no more capable of the crime for which you have impris- oned her, than a babe slumbering on its mother's bosom.  Sir Huston, you will repent, ay, bitterly repent, your cruel and hasty judgment, by and by." ( Repent!" repeated Sir Huston, while a smile of contempt curled his lip, "justice is not often repented of. The girl is in the hands of the law. I have no compassion, no pity, for crime. I would not save my own daughter from a dungeon were she a criminal." Markhaim saw that nothing was to be expected there. He bowed himself out from the presence of a man who seemed to have changed suddenly, from a warm-hearted, generous friend, to a'stern and iron- hearted enemy. As he strode through the house, the t   A HESTE  PoWERs'"GIRLHOODo    G1 desire seized him to look once again upon the picture, he had painted of Hester. He turned and had taken but a few steps in the drection of the gallery, when Roland stood before him. "Oh, my! sir," she began, applying the corner of her apron to her eye, isn't hit a hawful thing! To think 'ow we was deceived " "Deceived! What do you mean, woman?"Mark- ham almost hissed. "Beware how you talk. Mark me, there are others in this house more guilty than she is--" "Oh, dear, goodness me, sir, -you scare me!"said the woman, sniffling, and shrinking away. "Stop!" called Markhaim. "Is there a light in the picture-gallery?" "No, sir; beside, the-the picture you would be wanting to see haint there." ' Not there! What has become of it?" "No one knows, sir, but the family. The master must have removed it himself." Markham scarcely heard the woman out; he was filled with rage, and was glad to escape from the place. It was growing late, but he walked rapidly toward the village. The moon and stars were shining peacefully down upon the pretty landscape, and the lights from the cottage windows and open doorways looked as bright and as cheerful as ever. It was so familia, - so pleasant to all appearances; and the young man could scarcely realize that the sweet girl who had so often viewed the same lovely prospect with him was now lying in a cell.

The door was closed, and only a dim light shone from the window of the best room. Markham walked to the door, and knocked lightly. There came a low voice, bidding him Cnter; and, lifting the latch, he took a few steps forward into the room. But the picture that presented itself checked him suddenly. The old man was lying on a little bed at the further end of the room; his head was elevated, and his poor, old, haggard face was very pale and thin. The Bible lay open upon the bed before him; and Nancy, almost as much changed as her husband, sat beside him, with her chin resting on the palm of her hand. The beauti- ful order, which had hitherto always exhibited itself in and around the cottage, had gone; and, instead of the fragrant bunch of flowers, which usually stood upon the little deal table, there was now a withered one, -the last that Hester had plucked from the gar- den-beds. 'Come hither, come hither!" said the old man, extending both of his trembling hands. "I ware beginning to think ye ware like the rest, a-going to forsake us hin our time of trouble., But, thank the Lord, he ha'e 'eard my cry, and brought ye down to 'elp 'er,--ye will 'elp the child, poor thing?"The old man took his hand, and looked into his face with a sort of child-like trust. Markham found it difficult to control his emotion; he did so, however, and tried to soothe the old people. "Ye don't believe that she could steal, do you?" inquired Nancy.   HESTEIl POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     163 - "Oh, no! now I am here, you shall very soon have her back with you. Be comforted, for I will never leave you until she is free." The old man rubbed his hands, and laughed. ("The Lord bless -thee, - the Lord bless thee, my soil!" he said. "Thee will ha'e the recompense; a double por- tion thee shall ha'e." "But they say she takes it oncommon 'ard," said Nancy, "and don't get off 'er bed. Won't ye go to 'er?" "Have you?"  "Nae, nae!" interrupted Simon.; " we haint none o' us seed 'er. I be only now getting up, and Nancy, poor soul, went over an' walked round an' round the i. place, but they widn't let 'er bin.

"Ay," said lNqancy; "and they tell me, too,-that 'twill be transportation across the seas for 'er, when the child be innocent as a lamb.  There be on'y one thing a puzzle to rme, and that be the findin' of the brooch among 'er things. What do you say to that?" "It is all in great. mystery to me," Markham said. "But don't be troubled; if it is in the power of mortal man, I will bring her back to her home."  He lookedj at the clock; it was ten o'clock.  "I am going to the parsonage, and it may be very late when I  return. You had both better try to sleep, and leave this painful matter to God and to me. Can I stay here?- that is, have you room for me?" "Why, yes, we   have," said Nancy.

The road to the parsonage was a dismal one at that our, skirting a belt of woods, and it was only now nd then that the moonlight shone across the road. :he dense shadows from the woods lay across it black nd solemnly. He had not gone very far, before he iscovered that other persons were but a short distance i advance of him, and everything being profoundly till, except an occasional screech from an owl, he' ould distinctly hear a part of their conversation. " Oh, I know it's true!" said the first voice, " for I ras standing by when, the parson told it." "Poor thing," said the other. ' What a pity it is, ire! Why couldn't she have waited for her husband ) buy her such things? Folks say that he's able." "Oh, 'tis a pity! that it is. She was so purty, and ) young, and so sprightly, too; but the thought of ying in jail"-- "Dyifng in jail!" Markham repeated the words ver and over with a feeling of horror. He-could no- anger walk, he almost ran, until he caught up with lem. "Am I in the right road to the parsonage?" he sked, by way of saying something. "Yes, you're all right, sir," said the two strangers, most in a voice, " we're going there, ourselves.". "Do you live there?"    NESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     165 "We do, sir." "Then perhaps you can tell me if the rector is at home." "The rector! the rector! repeated one of the'two strangers; "he don't live there!

Markham smiled in spite of his troubled feelings  thanked them, and hurried on. His loud knocking at the hall door of the rector's house brought, after some delay, a very sleepy-looking servant. She opened the door about, two inches, and asked, in rather an unamla- ble way, who was there, and what was wanted. "wish to speak to Mr.-- , if only for a moment. Take this to him." He held out a card. "The gentleman be never disturbed in the hevenin', if you please, sir, and the mistress be gone to bed!" said the servant, without offering to take the card.  "Nevertheless," urged the artist, "I must see him. Take this,- he will see, me." Reluctantly the woman moved. off, looking back as she went, to see if she was followed. In about two minutes she came over the stairs, saying, "Laws a marcy, sir, I didn't know you in the dark. You can just go strailght hup, sir." The rector was   an eldcerly gentleman, tall and rather portly; his eyes were clear and dark, and his rather lonlg, wavy hair was white as snow.

He met the young man at his study door with extended hand. "I am'glad you are here!" he said; " we need you in this unhappy affair." Markham was exceedingly tired now, and was glad to drop into the chair offered by the reverend gentle- man. "Let us be candid with each other," he said ; " keep nothing from me. Is Hester Powers guilty of the crimes of which she is charged, in youre opinion, or is she not?" "The girl is not guilty!" the rector said, with emphasis; " not guilty! But my dear friend, you have asked me to be candid. -God forbid that I should give you unnecessary pain, but I think you should not be kept ignorant of her present situation. Hester Powers is ill, -dangerously ill. The blow has fallen too heavily upon her, and she is sinking under it." The young man lifted his hands; his face was very pale. 4"This is frightful!" he exclaimed.

HESTE$R POWERSs GIRLHOOD.     167 "there will a day come when that iron-hearted man will repent bitterly of his cruelty.", It was midnight when Markham left the rector. He had promised to return to the cottage. At ten o'clock on the next morning the rector's little gig stopped at Simon's garden-gate,.  The old man, though very feeble, was up and dressed for the first time for two weeks; his old, wrinkled face was very sorrowful, and between his trembling hands he held one 'of the rector's. ; Won' t ye take me to see my child?" he asked, in a pleading, pitiful tone. "Not to-day, Simon! not to-day, my friend ; you are scarcely well enough yet," the rector said. "Trust,- trust still in your heavenly Father; don't be afraid to commit her wholly to his pare. He doth not willingly afflict us, and when he does we must be patient, Wait - wait." ' Then ye will tell her, yes,: tell Hester," he said, looking upward, " tell her that I am praying, - pray- ing, yes, praying all day long for her. The place be gloomy, oh! so gloomy without her cheery voice. SWill ye tell her that I and her mother will come soon, and she shall ha'e the flowers that she loves best, poor. child?"  The two gentlemen turned away.   Many years seemed added to the old man's life since his child had been taken from him;, his locks were whiter, and his eyes deep-sunken with grief and sickness.. Now, how- ever, that Markham had come down, a little spark of hope had come into. his heart.  ,  ,  '  '  .   ^  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7752-00000085"/> 168      "JUDGE NOT;9"OR, Many friends had forsaken the old couple in the day of their humiliation and trouble. The Homes people and a few others of the neighbors still stood by them, and did all they could to comfort and help them. - But alas! many - the majority of their old friends - turned aside and were ready to condemn and speak reproachful words. Too many were glad to exaggerate and assert what 'they knew to be--false. Too many forgot the gentle girl as they had known her, - ministering beside the sick, reading God's word to the old and bed- ridden, -yes, now all such actions were forgotten. The little, generous kindnesses which she had shown, all around were buried, deep ^buried, while childish troubles were revived, and the poor, imprisoned girl had become a reproach and a byword in her native village. But the -rector and Markham are waiting now before the prison. The great iron gate is at length opened, and the two gentlemen are being conducted through the gloomy passages. Markham leaned heavily on his companion's arm, and his breath grew short and labored as he felt himself drawing near the narrow cell in which lay the unhappy girl. The turnkey seemed as if he wished to say some- thing; and stepping aside, the rector asked in a low tone, "How, does she seem this morning?" "'There be no change for the better, yer riderence," said the man, fumbling with the keys which hung from his girdle. r The doctor be with her now, poor thing; hers be a Elwre case of heart-breaking, it be!" He led the way to the cell and opened the door.    HESTER POWERS' GIBRLHOOD.    169 Ah! what pen can do justice to the painful scene presented! The once lovely, blooming girl lay, white as if the spirit had already flown, upon her little iron bed. The physician and nurse were bending over her, with sad and hopeless looks. Markham groaned in his anguish, and leaned against the wall of the cell. The rector stepped forward and spoke to the doctor, who immediately beckoned to Markham. "Speak to her, call her," he said-; " we cannot rouse her. This is indeed a sad - sad case." Markham took the little, transparent hand which lay upon the coverlid, and called her name; but, alas! the ears were dull, the once beautiful eyes heavy and half closed. There was no hope'! The doctor did not speak the cruel words, but all could read it in his looks. They who stood around knew that the only tribunal before which she would appear would be the one before which we must all stand, when the Judge of "quick and dead" will judge us according to the deeds done in the body. That. same afternoon another group ikeeled around that prison-bed; and it was a sight sufficiently touch- ing to have melted the most callous-heart when the aged father, bowed and broken-hearted, and the weep- ing, stricken mother knelt beside their only child. "( Hester - Hester!" called the old man, " won't ye open yer' eyes and speak to us? 'Tis yer father that be talking to ye. Oh, speak to-speak to us, my little one!"     - But alas! the heart was broken; its pulsations were -  -  '  ,     f     .   '.  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7752-00000086"/> 170.

In the freshness and beauty of youth she had been smitten down, and under the iron hand of accusation had been made a victim for the tomb! Oh! ye who hold power in your grasp, mete out your judgment with mercy, and fail not to remember that there is One who looketh into the heart, - One who judgeth righteously, - even He who shall judge us all in the latter day. "What art thou, O man! that thou shouldest judge thy brother?"Is it not said, ("Judge not, that ye be not- judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged ; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again"?"Be merciful! yea, be merciful with thy power." It was evening, and in that little, gloomy cell a faint light glimmered. One twinkling star shone down through the grated window; it peered down like an angel's eye, as if watching for the pure spirit to as- cend. There were four persons gathered around that little couch. The parents, the rector, and the affianced husband of the dying girl ; and they watched, - watched in silent agony, for it seemed as if the dread moment had come. But in a moment there came a sound, a whispering sound from the bed, - ' Father, mother!" , The old man started up. "She will live! she will live!" he cried. "O my Father! spare, oh, spare our child!" He fell upon his knees and buried his face.    HESTER: POWERS' GIRLHOOD.    171 "Hester," said Markham, bending low, " do you know me?"             i She pressed his hand slightly, and whispered, "Yes, yes! I am innocent! I am innocent!" "We know it, we know it, love." "I am going, going, Ernest," she whispered;" will you be kind to my - my parents? Raise me up just a little, I have prayed for this moment, prayed to be able to speak to, you once again, to tell you with my parting breath that--that I am 'innocent. Don't grieve for me. I shall be happy, very happy. I forgive them." For a few moments the rector and Markham walked to the door, and conversed in a low tone, while the poor girl still spoke to her weeping parents. They then came back to the bedside, and Markham, in a voice broken by emotion, expressed the desire to be united, even in that sad moment, to her whom he had chosen for his bride. The rector had prepared himself for such an event, and forthwith proceeded with the ceremony. As he pronounced: them man and wife, the girl opened her eyes and smiled, and then in an almost inaudible voice the closing blessing was spoken. It was over. "My wife!"Markham whispered ;but the dull ear scarce received the sound. The bride, the young wife was no more! Hester Powers was dead. She was be- yond the law; no earthly tribunal could reach her now. Her soul was in the presence of the Judge Eternal. A sound was heard near the door of the cell.

"Are you satisfied?" hissed forth the young hus- band in bitter tones as he pointed to the dead girl. "Ah! the memory of this hour will be a firebrand in your soul forever, and may God be as merciful to you, as you were to her." Sir Huston felt that it was no place for him. He -almost reeled away, for his suffering was intense. Ay, angels might have wept over the spectacle, as the stricken and aged parents clung in anguish to their dead child. *(    CHA rYER XVI. THE REACTION. )DEAD! dead! The word fell awfully, solemnly, up- on the ear. It stirred the deep fountains of every heart,-stirred them with sorrow, pity; pity for the bereaved parents, pity for the fair and lovely girl so suddenly and so sadly called from their midst. It would be difficult, indeed, to describe the emotions which rent- Sir Huston's heart, as he groped his way out of the gloomy prison. The man, proof against compassion, deaf to all entreaties, at a time when he could, perhaps, have saved her, had not looked unmoved upon the dead girl, she whom he had loved with almost a father's tenderness. No! then, then he would have given all his vast possessions could he have brought back life, restored the past. He saw her as in her beauty -she had stood by Isabella's side. Ah! he saw her, too, dead upon a prison-bed! Alas! wishing, regretting, what avail is either? The strong hand of death will not yield his prey; the grave will not give up its dead. Against the great iron gate he leaned; and the proud, strong man wept, wept! Not in cruelty had he com- 173  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7752-00000088"/> 174      u JUDGE NOT"OR, mitted the girl to a cell within those walls. No! no! we will do him justice. He believed that he was doing right, acting wisely. He as fully believed in Hester's guilt as he believed that God is Creator and Ruler of the universe. As firmly did he and his family believe that she had stolen the missing jewels as her parents and few remaining friends believed in her innocence. As Sir Huston Falkstone stood there, in the deep shadow of the prison wall, thinking of the dead girl as she lay there emaciated but still beautiful, with her glossy and abundant hair mottled and lying in disor- der over the narrow bed, he believed her guilty still; but he would have given worlds, had he possessed them, to have been able to wake up, as it were, from a dream, and find the sad events of the past few weeks a delusion. Alas! it was no dream, no delusion; the girl was dead. "Dead, dead!" he repeated, as he slowly turned his steps toward "West Oakland," his lordly home, with a' shud- der. Hlow could he tell the sad news? Since the day of Hester's imprisonment there seemed to be resting over the house a mighty pall; all its brightness, its life, seemed dead. Isabella missed her friend, the sweet companionship, the affection, the girl brought with her; and, although she felt that she had been deceived and robbed, there still remained some tenderness in her heart. She loved her, and mourned her unhappy fate. Early in the evening, as the family were sitting quietly brooding over the painful circumstance, the in- telligence was brought to them that Hester was dying.   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.      175 Sir Huston turned white as marble, though he half- believed the statement to be false., "Father," Isabella said, "I must go to her. Don't refuse this appeal. I must see her. Hester dying! No! no! she shall not die! Oh! why, why did I place her there?" ' Isabella," said Lady Falkstone, "be calm, my child;  you have nothing to reproach yourself with; she is suf- fering from her own crimes." "But, mother," said Isabella, " she has endured enough. Father can--I will purchase her'freedom! I'd give my life to save her!" "Isabella, you talk rashy. Be calm. She is in the hands of the law, and it must take its course. She may be suffering, even ill ; but it is only proper that she should suffer. Crime, and disgrace, such as hers, under such peculiar circumstances, too, are calculated to bring suffering to one more hardened than she is. Don't per- mit yourself to be alarmed. I will see myself what such a report means." He did go, little dreaming that when he should reach the prison cell, he would find that another guest had just entered. Now, as he drew near to his home, and- saw by the lights that his wife and daughter were still up, waiting to hear the sad tale, his heart sank deep, deep! He dreaded to tell them,-to say to his daughter that-her friend was no more; that the soul of the guilty girl had fled, gone to receive its sentence from the Judge of " the quick and dead." The moon, emerging from behind a cloud, threw X .       .-  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7752-00000089"/> 176       .n JUDGE NOT; "OR, down a fuJl clear light over the lodge and eastern gate- way of the Park, and Sir Huston saw, or thought he saw, a form, ghost-like in appearance, leaning against one of the pillars. It was half in shadow, half in light, and as he stood for a moment to look, he saw the white garments fluttering in the night-breeze. Fear was a stranger to his breast ; but in his present depressed state of mind, and the recollection of the scene he had just left, he felt a chill creep through his veins. He turned away, then looked again; but the figure was still before him, now coming toward him with a quick and eager step. It was Isabella. She had come out alone, in the mid- night, to watch for him. Far rather would Sir Huston have encountered ghost or. goblin than his daughter at that moment. He feared to tell her the sad truth; yet to prevaricate, or to even insinuate what was not so, he considered more disgraceful than a bold lie. "Isabella," he said, extending his arms to meet her, "your hair and garments are wet with dew. Why are you here?" But Isabella's wild and feverish eyes were looking into his, and reading, reading the truth. She knew, by her father's looks, by his manner, by his voice, which seemed to come up from the very depth of his soul, that he had a fearful tale to unfold. They stood, the girl's eyes fixed upon her father's, her lips scarce moving as she breathed forth the words, ' Father, she is dead!"   OlESTER PO ERS' GIRLHOOD.'    1" "Yes," answered Sir Hustonj in a deep and painful voice; " she is dead!" One heavy groan, and Isabella had fallen senseless upon the damp ground. Sir Huston did notjwait to think, or call assistance; he lifted her in his 4rms and bore her to the house. Her swoon was a long and heavy one. She had received a severe shock, a wound which time alone could heal. In her dreams that night-she talked only of Hester.; ah! she walked with her, too, as in times past, through flowery lanes, by the rippling brooks, where they lis- tened to the gray bircd's song. Then the scenes would change, and prison, death would tremble on her lips. Her father watched beside her all through that weary night, and gave the strictest orders that hereafter the name of Hester Powers should not be spoken in her hearing. The next day Isabella, was to all appearances bet- ter,- better than her parents could have expected,- and they hoped that, now she knew the worst, she would bear it with the same strength of will that she had ever exhibited under trial. Isabella was a true Christian, and never failed to find peace and strength in the exhaustless fountain of a Saviour's love. She needed strength, comfort, now; that strength which cometh from above. Without it she would have sunk under the heavy pressure of grief; the feeling, ever gnawing at her heart, that she had done wrong in accusing her friend. She tried very hard, to check those feelings, and to hide her sorrow from her parents, who she knew were watching her. 12  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7752-00000090"/> 178      J'UDGoE NOT;"OR, with tenfold anxiety and tenderness. She kept in her own breast the almost frantic desire she had to know more about her former friend. - But no one spoke her name. All day long she listened impatiently for some one to speak of her ; but no one did, -- no one spoke the forbidden name. "I can no longer bear this silence," she said to herself; and, knowing that most likely the subject was discussed below stairs, and a favorable opportunity presenting itself, she descended to that part of the house where Roland and Grieves usually sat. Isabella felt sure of gaining some information by. going where they were; for, poor women, they belonged to that unfortunate class who loved the horrible. They read murders with the greatest zest, and fairly grew fat upon suicides, railroad accidents, etc. They were, therefore, most pleasantly employed on this occasion. Roland had been to the village that morning,. and had gathered all the news relating to the sad affair that could be had, and, aided by a strong imagi ation, she had enough to relate of a sufficiently exciting character:--" the marriage in the cell,"' the dying girl's full confession," " the attempted suicide of the young husband," and, lastly, that " the criminal had declared before all present that she would haunt the ' West Oakland' house forever, and show- a light over her own grave every night as the bell from the old church tower should strike twelve."' In all such stuff Isabella felt no interest, -and with a weary, sickening feeling, she was about to turn away, when Grieves asked when the funeral would take place. ,             i   ZESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.    179 "Why, this evening, near sundown," answered Ro- land; " but I tell you I wouldn't go to hit for the 'ole of Hengland."' "Near sundown," Isabella said, as she returned to the parlor. She seemed exceedingly calm, and her parents had no idea that she knew what they had so desired to keep from her. They felt glad that she had not asked any questions, and were satisfied that she had no wish to know more of the sad occurrence. The wind was. unfavorable for the toll of the bell to reach "West Oakland,"- so they thought. But Miss Falkstone had gained all the information she desired, and at a suitable time she went up into one of the upper chambers in the western wing of the building. She stationed herself in the recess of the window, that, lif possible, she might catch the first sound of the bell. It came at length, - that dull and solemn knell, faintly at first, but her strained ear caught it. Again and again it came, curdling her blood, and be- numbing every feeling. She clung to the heavy dra- pery'for support, while she prayed for -strength, and determined to go forth to see her, whom she had so tenderly loved, committed to the grate. "No one will know mie. I must be among those who may follow her to her last resting-place. Dear Hester! you wronged me, but, oh! I have long since forgiven you, and repented my own course in the mat- ter.

Oh that the blot, the stain could be removed from your memory!" But louder, louder came the knell, and Isabella went quickly over the stairs. Procuring a cloak .and hood belonging to Roland, she left the house through a nar- row side passage, which was rarely used, and followed a path through the thick shrubbery. By this way she and Hester had often gone to the village, for it was the shortest way of getting there. At that time of the evening there was no danger- of discovery, for the gar- deners had finished their day's work, and the shrubs were high. Excitement gave her strength, and she ran until her home was lost in the distance behind, and the solemn old church-tower rose in full view before her. Dismally the knell tolled forth its sad tale, as the young girl stepped over the stile into the graveyard. One portion of it was already in deep shadow; and sadly the trailing willows waved in the evening breeze, and there -seemed to come a moan out upon the air, as the wind swept through the trees. But the old gray steeple,-yes, that great, ivy-grown tower, speaking forth its voice of warning to the living, -repeating the words "Prepare! prepare!"-its top was crowned. with glowing golden lights, - its summit was bathed in glory, and the tops of the distant woods; and across the valleys, too, there was brightness and beauty, as the sun went slowly down. But now Isabella sees from her secluded and shadowy stand a long train approaching; that they were com- ing, coming with slow, sad step and bowed heads. Ah! the village behe was coming, too,- coming to t    H ESTER  POWERS GIRLHOOD.     181 be laid to rest in the narrow bed, where, by and by, we all must sleep.

They are all there,--all coming. In her anguish and despair Isabella mingles with the throng. She stands near the open grave, and sees the coffin with the wreath of half-blown buds lowered; she hears the stifled sobs, and the tremulous, solemn voice of the rector, as he commenced the beautiful and impressive church-service at the grave,- "Man that is born of a woman hath but -a short time to live, and is" full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay. "In the midst of life we are in death.

"Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts: shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers; but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and mer- ciful Saviour, thou most worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last hour, for any pains of death to fall from thee."  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7752-00000092"/> 182      "JUDGE NOT; "OR, "Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God, in his wise Providence, to take out of this world the soul of our deceased sister, we therefore commit her body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; looking for the general resurrection in the last day, and the life -of the world to come, through our Lord Jesus Christ; at whose second coming in glorious majesty to judge the world, the earth and the sea shall give up their dead; and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him shall be changed, and made like unto his own glorious body; according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself."

With an un- natural strength she pushed her way out from amongst them and fled. The sun now sinking in the west shone forth, lighting up with holy beauty the rector's face, as with reverence it looked upward as he pro- nounced the solemn benediction.

ISABTELLA'S MOURNING. THERE was consternation at "West Oakland." Isa- bella was trot to be found. What the feelings of the master and mistress were then, we dare not say. But as Sir Huston leaned against the heavy carved panel of the door, he looked like one preparing himself to meet some fearful trial. Those who saw him read what was going on in his breast, as it heaved with the exoess of emotion. It was dark. The twilight had merged-into the deep- er shades of night, and but few stars shone forth be- tween the gathering clouds. "She has gone to the grave," he said ; and, taking a couple of men with hum, they went forth. Gladly would Sir Huston have avoided looking toward the church-yard then, for he felt now, when it was too late, that he had been too'severe; that, had he acted differently, Hester would have lived, and this great sorrow, which was crushing many a heart, would have been spared them. Theywalked on, each one thinking his own thoughts. They entered the solemn yard, but all was quiet there; no sound but the sighing winds,--no voice but that 181   ESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.      185 which came, more powerfully than living words, from the silent resting-places of the dead. They sought the little grave, - the one just made; but Isabella Falk- stone was not there. No! from the yawning grave she had fled with a wail of anguish. But a sound had caught Sir Huston's ear, just the faintest sound, as it passed by on the night air. "Hark!" he said; " what was it?" "Only the moan of the wind in the trees, sir." "' No! no!" The father's heart, the father's ear, was keener than  his servant's. There was something familiar in the low, moaning sound. It came again, and then he ran, - ran in the direction whence it came. Isabella's strength had not supported her very far; she had, fallen exhausted, and was now resting her weary head upon a little grass-grown mound.- Her white garments were wet with the dews of the night, and by her side lay the cloak and' hood belonging to her maid. "Isabella!" exclaimed her father, as he beheld her. "Yes, that is my name," the girl answered, feebly. "Will you take me to my home,- for I am very, very cold?" "My poor child!" Her father lifted her in his, arms, as if she had been a little child, and pressed her tenderly to his aching breast. They wrapped her in the cloak, and by turns the master and servants carried her home. Before long, fever raged in'her veins; and for many, many  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7752-00000094"/> 186       JUDIE NOT;"OR, days- nay, weeks -her life hung upon a very slender , thread. In her delirium, Hester was ever by her; and when reason returned, and the mind was capable of thought, Hester still filled her fancies. "She must be taken away," said the physician. "Change of scenery will alone restore her." And Sir Huston and Lady Falkstone gladly acceded to a plan which would move them, at least for a while, from the painful atmosphere surrounding "West Oakland." Even Isabella breathed more comfortably as she contemplated a change. Now, there were too many things around her which reminded her of her lost friend. She was perpetually haunted by the sad events of the last few weeks, and very frequently by the gnawings of remorse for having: been the chief instru- ment in bringing Hester to her sad end. Had she maintained silence, the stolen jewels, like the brilliant spray, might have been brought back. But, alas! she could not bring back the past. In spite of Sir Huston's commands relative to Hes- ter's name, the servants would talk, and many a thing came to Isabella's ear when those who spoke believed her to be asleep. She had heard it said that the girl had confessed to having taken many more articles than were then missed; and, on the contrary, that, she had asserted her innocence even with her latest breath. To satisfy herself of the truth, Isabella expressed a wish to see the rector of the parish before leaving her home, but which her parents opposed, believing that what he would say would only reopen the wound and bring suffering rather than peace. 9       .     . .

If I go away from here without knowing what I so much desire to, I shall only carry away in my heart a worm, -a wound which will, in the end, destroy me. He who can alone penetrate to the secrets of our hearts, - he knoweth that I acted my part from a pure sense of justice, of right. I loved her, ah! too much,- even as my sister; but I believed that I should be, in the sight of God, equally guilty with her by keep- "ng her crime a secret."  "Isabella," said Lady Falkstone, "have we not all suffered enough by her wickedness? Can you not put it from you? Of what use are all these regrets and re-  pinings? The girl we took to our hearts, and she wan- tonly abused our trust, robbed us. You acted wise- ly, and have nothing to accuse yourself of. Rise above this nonsense!

Ask to know nothing more about the girl than you already know; and, for your parents' sakes, blot from your heart, your memory, every trace, every vestige of a character so worthless." But Isabella could not; she could not forget Hes- ter, nor feel embittered, even now, against the mem- ory of her unfortunate friend. She was not satisfied, and again she urged that she might have an interview with her rector. This time her request was granted, and Sir Huston himself went over to the parsonage, in order to have a conversation with the rector first.  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7752-00000095"/> '188      "JUDGEo NOT;"OR; Isabella's illness had made a fearful change in her appearance. The delicate roundness of her face had gone; her cheeks were hollow, and, instead of the hap- py brightness so characteristic of her face, there was a painful, mournful - eagerness on every feature as the rector'entered. He would have introduced other subjects, - spoken of less painful things,-but Isabella seemed to have but one thought; and, regardless of all her parents' cautions and entreaties, she asked, almost breathless- ly, to be told without reserve all that she should ask. ' Remember," she said, looking up into the good man's face, "I have a right tol know; she was my friend, and I am responsible for her imprisonment and - and death." "The whole thing is wrapped in mystery, my dear young lady." "Yes; do you think she was guilty?" "I do not," the rector said; " but let me say to you, Miss Falkstone, that the part you acted in the sad drama you did with pure motives. Leave it now in the hands of God; he will make the dark things plain by and by, and bring to light that which is now hidden from our eyes. No grief will bring her back. No earthly power can restore her to her bereaved friends. Thee sudden removal of our young friend, one who was so much esteemed in her native village, has ,been a blow to many hearts.

In a few more days the "West Oakland" mansion was left in the keeping of servants, and the Falkstone family were on their way to foreign lands. Roland, however, had declined to accompany her young lady, being fearful of trusting her valuable life among such heathens as she had heard dwelt on the continent? "Eat frogs dressed in wine, and drink gin in the breakfast tea? No, not she!" The thought was enough for Roland; so on that, she resigned her situation with many tears and very many sniffles. She told Miss Falkstone that it was her inten- tion to get a home of her own.  "In this way, if you please, my young lady. I means to hopen a kind o' lodging-house hup in London. It won't be hon hany grandee style, miss, honly small hat the beginning." She waited some time for ,some comments upon her , information, but, finding that Miss Falkstone remained silent, she began again with an outhurst of feeling,- ' This awful thing have sort of broke me hup, ma'am, and showed me the uncertainty of hev'rything in this trifling world; and beside, ma'am, tis dreadful the risk a body's character runs a livin' hout." "I hope you will do well," Isabella said, coldly. She had become disgusted with the woman, of late, and was more glad than sorry to part with her.

She desired to cause a scene, to be begged to remain, and to have her young lady quite distressed to part with her valuable services; but Isabella quietly heard her out, and wished her well. Still sniffling, she courtesied herself out from the young lady's presence; her heart was running over with wrath. "After all she had done, to let her go so! It was ungrateful!"She declared the whole world in a state of corruption exceeding that of the "cities of the plain," and not a fit place for a good, solid Chris- tian like herself to remain in. She packed with ner. vous haste, scarce speaking a civil word even to " dear Grieves "As for Mr. Rubens, she avoided him alto- gether, declaring that he had made mischief. All things being ready, she followed her trunk and band- boxes into the, donkey cart which was ready to take her to the stage. And now, dear reader, we will return to the little cottage on the hill. Joy had been turned to mourning there! Since the evening of the funeral, few had been seen by the parents. The kind, good rector and' the Holmes family were the only persons they wished to see. Markham was still there, for Simon could not let him go away quite yet; beside, it afforded him some consolation to be able to visit, in the quiet of the evening, the grave of his young wife, whose memory was to him pure and stainless. The severe trial through which he had passed had wrought its sad effects on him, too, and but for the old people, whom she in her last moments had committed to his care, he would have given up, and perhaps returned to   HESTER POtWERS GIRLHOOD. .    191 his old, unhappy state. But for their sakes he bore the trial bravely. It was sad, indeed, to see the old man so like a little child now, for his mind had been shattered by the blow. He watched Markham all day long, anid would sometimes speak of Hester as though she still lived in the bright anticipation of a happy future. Then he would remember his sorrow, and say, pleadingly, "Ye won't leave me too, will ye?" "I must go for a little while," Markham said, one morning ; " just to get a home where we may live always together; and while I am away you must both try to get better, and think of the time when the world will be told that Hester Powers was unjustly accused; that she did not rob her friend." "Ay! ay! will that day ever come?" the old man asked with a childish laugh. "Ah!" said the young man, bitterly, " it will come, - that it will, - and then the castle as well as the cot- tage will have its day of gloom!' The old man rubbed his hands, and exclaimed, "The Powers folks be an 'onest race and the poor, lamb be only sacrificed for naught. I'll live; yes, Nancy and me will see the day when our little one's name will wear no spot!" The young artist was now obliged to return to Lon- don. Business was calling loudly for him, and Lord Grumby was impatient for his return. Being then laid up with another-attack of gout, he wrote to Markham to come directly to his residence as soon as he arrived in the city.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7752-00000097"/> 192      "   JUDGE NOT; "OR, Although not in a very suitable frame of mind for visiting any one, Markham acceded to the re- quest; for he needed advice, his funds in hand having run low, and he felt the necessity of havifng the two old people established in a home before he could apply himself again to his profession. They were now totally dependent on him, for the active old man had by his sorrow been reduced to helpless- ness. These thoughts nerved him to meet his old friend and patron, and enabled him to explain his difficulties at once. Lord Grumby listened to him quietly; that is, as quietly as. the "infernal twinges" in his feet would permit him. Then the old fellow leaned forward, smoothed out a wrinkle or two in the cushion on which his bandaged feet lay, pulled at the ruffle of his shirt, and gave his crimson necktie a jerk; then look- ing up, he bellowed out, - "'Markham, my dear fellow, you're a fool,.-a most confounded fool!

"My lord!" said the young man, "I should be unwortly the name of man could I forget or neglect for an hour those who are so dependent upon me in their weakness and distress. But for them I could not so soon return to my work; their wants stimulate me to exertion, and so long as I live,.and honorably fulfil my vow pledged to her as her pure spirit passed away, so long shall I be blessed.

"I will rent it, my lord!" C Rent it! - confound this gout! - rent it, indeed! If you want the confounded hole, take it, and hold your tongue!"    r The place to which his lordship had reference was built in cottage style; it was very old, and had fallen much into decay, was far out on the outskirts of the city, and was surrounded by a high stone wall. Gloomy as it appeared to Markham as he approached it, he was not slow to think of the advantages it had over the cramped-up, gloomy little houses in the city, in the midst of dust and smoke and bustle, which would have poorly suited the old pair. This place was retired, more healthy, and had a large garden, and, though, it was now one mass of weeds and thistles, Markham already saw that it would prove a pastime and a blessing to the old 'man. It had once been quite a pretty place, and quite a number of the fruit-trees were still in a flourishing condition; some vines, too, were clinging to the mouldering walls. The young man's spirits began to freshen as he walked around, and looked into the passage or hall which ran through the house; he looked into the rooms on either-side; they were comfortable and very pleasant.   :HESTER POWERS: GILROOD..     195 ' The tears started to his eyes as the thought flashed i  . across his mind that she, whose presence would have thrown a sweet charm around this forsaken place, had passed away. Lord Grumby was delighted that the old place suited his young friend so well, and, as soon as his gout would permit him, he drove out to take a look at the " con- founded hole." "Well, now," said he, " it wants this, - to be swept away from off the earth, every stick and stone of it, and a new, neat place reared in its stead." "Not quite that, my lord; it needs some repairs, 'tis true "-- "A few repairs!" echoed the old gentleman. "Well, do what you choose. Here's a check for fifty pounds; make it go as far as you can!" Markham was not slothful in business; men were set to work about the repairs, and in a little while Lord Grumby was Mhimself surprised at the comfortable appearance of the cottage; and, by the way, put many a comfort into it that else would not have found its way there; and, when all was ready and cleaned, the generous-hearted old fellow placed in Markham's hands a deed which made i-t his forever. i Don't thank me," he said; "-it is not worth it. Be as comfortable and happy as you can. You are a good fellow and an honor to- your profession." Markham once more started for the village of Oak- land. He found the old people no more reconciled to their loss than when he left them; indeed, the old man seemed to mourn more painfully.

He took no notice of anything, apparently, as they rode through the city streets, but looked vacantly forth; but when the cab stopped outside of their new home, he looked up into the young man's face and said, - "Did they bring 'er 'ere?" "This is our home," Markham said, as he led him through the garden, which was still in the condition he had first found it,--all overgrown with tall weeds; briers, and thistles. "Bless me! bless me!" exclaimed the old man; "this be dreadful! I'll be obliged to get to work, lNancy."

As he spoke, he saw the old man's face brighten, and he felt an inward joy that this home had been prepared for them. Nancy said very little; she had walked on to the front door, and was looking into the cool hall, with its clean blue stone floor;-into the best room or parlor, where the great old clock - their own eight-day- was in the corner, ticking forth the seconds; the little deal table, too, on which stood a glass of fresh flowers. Alas! what were those familiar things to her now? They only reminded her of one departed. But the days passed on, each bringing its own cares, and they found in occupation a solace; at least the keenness of their sorrow began to soften. "Labor is rest from the sorrows that greet us, Rest from all petty vexations that greet us, Rest from sin-promptings that ever entreat/us, Rest from world-sirens that lure us to ill."

ISABELTLA'S RETURN. "Time, as he passes-us, has'a dove's wings, Unsoiled, and swift, and of a silken sound." TIME moves on quietly, healing our griefs, reconcil- ing us to the bereavements and trials of life, bidding us look forward, never backward. Thus we find Isabella Falkstone, after two years' ab- sence from II West Oakland." The wound which she had carried away with her, if not entirely healed, was- so carefully covered up that no trace of it was discernible in her daily life. Hester's name was never spoken, - perhaps altogether forgotten. Under the influences of change, of gay scenes and pleasures, Isabella had re- gained both health and spirits, and had returned with her parents to London in time to enjoy a little of its gayety before the season closed. Sir Huston and his lady rejoiced to hear Isabella- speak of returning to '( West Oakland," as if the painful occurrences which had taken her from it had never been. The young lady had lost none of 1 her love for country life, and she even grew animated ds she described the charms of her home to the young friends whom she had invited to accompany her to it. 198   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     199 Sir Huston had heard from Lord Grumby, whom he had seen since his arrival in town, that Markham was prospering in his profession, and that he with the old people, whom he (Grumby) had never seen, still believed in Hester's innocence. Sir Huston only smiled, and gladly changed the con- versation by inviting the old gouty gentleman to spend the summer with them at "West Oakland." "Ay, I believe I will," he said; c; haven't been in the country much for years. When do you go down?" In May," said Sir Huston. "To my mind our Eng- lish springs are charming." '; Delicious!" exclaimed Grumby, as he walked up and down the drawing-room  with thumbs stuck in his waistcoat pockets. "Delicious, sir! They renew . one's youth; in fact, make us old dogs wish that a- longer lease than threescore had been allowed us, hey? Ha, ha, ha!" "Life is too short," said Sir Huston, thoughtfully. "Yes," answered Lord Grumby; " but, after all, we bachelors keep young a good while. Now, except for this perplexing gout, I'm as young as I was five-and- twenty years ago. I tell you, sir, the blood is yet hot in my veins, and sport, sir,.-sport, I say,- hasn't lost a charm for Old Grumby." "That is good news," said Sir Huston.; " for, the truth is, we mean to have a gay summer and take down with us a lively party. That unfortunate affair threw a gloom over the place for a whiles and at one time I was afraid that it would be perhaps many years be- : fore Miss Falkstone would be able to:return there; but, as  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7752-00000101"/> -VV      Ct JIJD6 E DJOT;i"OR0 far as we can judge, she has forgotten it, and we hope that hereafter the ancient halls of ' West Oakland ' will exhibit more gayety and mirth than ever before, even in the days of its boasted greatness." Again the spring began t-oopen. Flowers and birds came with perfume and song, and once more "West, Oakland " was astir. The trees were putting forth their tender leaves, and the squirrels and the little lambs and the pretty fawns frolicked in the glittering sun- shine. To some in the village of Oakland the news of the Falkstones' return to their seat was exceedingly pleas. ant news. They brought with them a sort of commo- tion. Many, long out of work, would find employment when they were back; beside, they had been very good to the poor; and then to the plain country folks it was al- ways pleasant to see finely dressed ladies; and although some shook their heads and said, ', It had been a bad day for the Powers folks when they had first come," yet many more rejoiced in anticipation of good beef soup and other kindnesses shown them by the Falk- stones in the bleak day s of winter. Two years had rolled round since Hester had been laid in her grave; yet none in the village had forgotten her. HHow could they forget her? -The old cottage on the hill was always telling the sad tale. It had stood empty ever since, and the storms of winter had carried away some of its thatched roof; the porch was broken; and the once prettily trained vines hung over the door. way in heavy, tangled masses; and on the-box-bordered   HESTER POnWERS G IRLHOOD.     201 beds, where the sweet flowers grew, were rank weeds now.  Ah! it was no' wonder that some felt badly to hear that the "West Oakland "family were coming back. Grace, most of all, regretted it. X\   She was no longer a milliner's apprentice; she had learned the trade well, and had "' set up for herself." The best room in her mother's cottage had been turned into a little shop, and the window was always prettily decorated with tastefully trimmed caps and bonnets. She had been very successful, too, and was able to help her parents provide for the smaller members of ( the family, little brothers and sisters whose wants were many. She thought that she never should be able to look upon Isabella Falkstone, particularly now, for people said that she was very gay and dashing, and had forgotten Hester altogether. Nevertheless, there were much talking and much bustle in the village on the day of their arrival, for many guests had come down with them, and it was- quite a gay sight to the villagers when the splendid chariots drove through, filled with elegant ladies and foreign-looking gentlemen. And it was pleasant, too, to see Sir Huston and his lady, and to receive from them a smile of recognition as of old.            ' On the coming Sunday, every new dress, bonnet, or coat that could be had, found its way to church, to wit- ness the stately train of ladies and gentlemen that would siweep up the broad stone aisles. But little change could be seen in Sir Huston and Lady Falkstone.

But two years had made a great change in their daughter. Isabella was taller, and the girlish manners of former times had given place to a more womanly appearance. There seemed to be a bright- ness, a gayety about her now, entirely, new. She talked, and even indulged in a merry laugh with her companions, as she walked with them down the avenue of the church-yard. Many comments were made, even by the village peo- ple, upon her change of appearance and manner. Little did they know what Isabella's smiles covered! That church-yard, --it brought back sad memories; and the young lady was glad to mask her feelings with assumed gayety. No! no! Isabella Falkstone had not forgotten the past, nor blotted from her memory the sweet friend who was slumbering under the soft, green turf. She was glad to escape from the solemn yard, and toput aside the past by indulging in present pleasures. "West Oakland" was very gay, and every day brought with it some new enjoyment, and Miss Falkstone found but little time to indulge in painful reflections. She was gay and merry with the rest. Among the guests there were two or three who had heard just a little,--enough of the story of Hester Powers to make them desire to know more. "The portrait, what had become of it?"They had set their hearts upon finding out, and were determined to see it. They were with Isabella, one morning, in the gallery where it had once hung; and, as they stood beneath the beautiful pictures- executed by Markham, the impulse   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     203 of curiosity came too strongly, and one. of the young ladies asked, - ( Miss Isabella, tell us about the girl, - about the por- trait, that for a little while filled that vacant space?" But Isabella grew so livid, and trembled so violently, that they regretted the unfortunate request, at the mo- ment, but were not satisfied. Woman-like, they were still watching for an opportunity to gratify their curiosity. Lord Grumby was now one of the guests; and, most fortunately, came unaccompanied by his gout. The old gentleman was younger than the youngest gentle- man present. The young ladies were his delight, and he accounted nothing a trouble that would. enhance their pleasure. His good-natured, pompous ways added, much to the amusement of the young people, and, in-. deeds they would have considered it quite a misfortune to lose so pleasant an acquisition to their circle. The old lord was a famous chess-player, and there was nothing hew loved better than, in the cool of the evening, to have a game out'under the trees in front of the mansion. Frequently a merry party would assemble under the deep shade of the great oak, which stood a little to the right of the avenue; the same old, massive tree of which mention has been made before. The great hollow in it was rapidly increasing, and ex- tended now almost through its ponderous trunk. This decay, and eating out, as it were, of its very vitals, seemed in no way to affect its life and vigor; its mammoth branches were as rich in foliage as ever, and the birds still flocked to its leafy shelter, and the  deer still loved to rest in its shade. Many a sweet  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7752-00000103"/> 204      "JUDGE NOT;"OR, song was carolled forth from out its top, for the little songsters were safe in the wide-spreading and cluster- ing foliage. And, my reader, it was a beautiful sight, a bright picture, when a party of graceful -and beauti- ful women, richly attired, and gentlemen, in courtly dress, sat around, -under the cool shade of this noble old tree, snuffing the perfumed hay as it came up from the meadows; while book, or embroidery, or game lay on the lap, or on the green turf at their feet. Yes, it was a pretty sight. Occasionally, Isabella would add to the enjoyment of the hour a little music; she would have her harp brought forth, and as she swept its chords, and mingled her rich voice with its tender cadence, all nature seemed intent. Truly it was a joyous party at ' West Oakland. "Never before had so much gayety, so many mirthful voices, resounded through those ancient halls. The weeks,- nsay, months were passing, but the guests were still there, No one thought of leaving so delightful a place for the city. Even Lord Grumby, who had at first declared that it would be impossible for him to stay away from his club more than four weeks, now declared that the " confounded club" was a nuisance, and he didn't care if he never saw it again. He never was so well in his life, - never so happy. What would the dusty, muddy, smoky, misty, rainy city feel like, to a fellow: coming from such a paradise as "West Oakland"? The barley harvest was at hand, and the golden tops of the ripening grain was the topic of conversation among all classes. So far it had been a year of plenty;   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.      205 and now, as the farmers looked abroad upon the golden fields they rejoiced, for there was a promise of an abundant harvest. The reapers are going forth, now, with sickles sharp and glitterin , as they rest upon their shoulders; but before they thrust them in there arises a joyous shout, which is echoed far away over the hills, - t"Now glory to the steel That shines in the reapers hand, And thanks to God, who has blessed the sod, And crowned the harvest land I " The harvest! The harvest! To the guests at"West Oakland" it brought new and delightful amusement. The brilliant saloons of the mansion were now de- serted for the field, and in the evening, which brought the weary reapers home, it afforded to the ladies gen- uine pleasure to wait upon them at the tables placed under the trees. They were happy indeed, and the sun- burnt, honest laborer smiled his thanks as he received his laden plate from delicate hands. One would have fancied that our old friend Grumby had never felt a " gouty twinge " or any other twinge,; he was still the life of the party, either in the field or at home. He was sheaf-binder now, and before one could count ten he was helping some little ragged gleaner to pick up the stray ears. Ah! the harvest, the harvest-time brings something more than bread.  It brings plenty of enjoyment, plenty of fun and joy!  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7752-00000104"/> 206       "JUDGE NOT;"OR, "There's merry laughter in the field, And harmless jest and frolic rout And the last harvest wain goes by, With its rustling load so pleasantly, To the glad and clamorous harvest shout.

And there were feasting and fuin and brightness at ' West Oakland," and ladies and gentlemen, as they glided over the waxen floors, caught the rejoicing sound of " harvest hiome." Farmers chuckled as they housed the last load, and said, as they looked toward the brassy heavens, "Just in time; for there's a storm coming!" Yes, it was coming!    The day opened hot and sultry, and toward noon the low muttering thunders came along over the distant forests and hills. The ladies looked from   the windows with  discontented faces. What were they to do? It was dismal to be obliged to resign all out-door' sports, and just sit around quietly waiting and watching the gathering storm; but there was no alternative, and one by one they sought amusement. The young ladies so curious to know the story of our heroine were together at one of the windows. They had been amusing themselves for some time by watching the herds of deer going toward the groves, and the peacocks as they went to their shelter. "Caroline," said one, "this is just the time for hearing stories.

Being in a particularly happy mood on this occasions she indulged in a few of her best ghost- stories, and really made the girls cry with laughing. Poor Grieves!

I kin stand hat the winder, and watch the forked tongues a- flashin' and whippin' acrost the hlhwful 'ealvens, feeling as peaceful and composed as a lamb, my dears, just as Christians should!" She concluded with a sigh,   3 while 'draining the last drop from her ale-glass. The girls smiled at each other, and then Miss Caro- line leaned forward and said,-  .  "' Mrs. Grieves, we want you to tell, us something  about that girl who robbed Miss Falkstone of her jewels." "Oh! my sakes alive!" exclaimed Grieves; " don't ask me to mention 'er wicked name. I've had bother enough wey that thing; now only last night, youngm ladies, I was scared all but hout of my senses! ' "With what? Anything relating to her, Hester, I think her name 'Was."

"That she was," answered Grieves; "hers was a face a body couldn't forget.

"Yes, I'll let you see hit to-morrow." The girls flew back to the parlors, for by this time the storm had become quite violent. The wind was sweeping in-heavy gusts over the park, carrying with "    , ^               e0  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7752-00000106"/> 210    -  "D JeDE N OT"OR, it leaves and branches stripped from the groves. The sturdy trees were bending beneath the fury of the blast, and the whole air was darkened. The vivid, lurid  tongues of fire leaped through the black clouds, and  the very earth seemed to quake with the rolling thun-  ders. The young ladies trembled as they divested them-  selves of jewelry and hid in quiet corners. Sople few, however, Were not alarmed, and they, with Isabella and her father, stood near the window to watch the  fearful, yet sublime storm. "O father!" said Isabella, laying her hand upon his arm; " see! see, how our noble old oak trembles!" One more furious blast, and there was a cry from  many voices, "The oak! the oak is gone!" Yes, that mighty, magnificent tree, which had stood the storms of centuries, had fallen!- or, rather, half fallen.  Its lofty head was bending over, and its lower branches sweeping the ground.  The storm continued. Wind, lightning, thunder, --all swept on, and those who stood mourning over the destroyer's work looked for the tree to be laid still lower; but it remained just as the first cruel blow had left it, like a dying warrior. Isabella wept its fall, and all who witnessed it regretted that it should have been made the storm-king's victim, while others, of no value, stood erect and boldly shook the rain-drops from their leaves. "Well, it is gone; the monarch of the park is gone," said Sir Hastoln, rather sadly; " but it had lived its   HESTErR POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     2" day, and a very long one, too; so we must give him up as we would a valued friend." The storm sobbed itself out by and by, and the morning dawned bright and dazzling. The air was cool and refreshing, and the flowers, grass, and trees were spangled with glittering drops. The gentlemen had walked out early to look at the fallen tree. ( Is it entirely down?" inquired Lady Falkstone. "No," answered Sir Huston; X but Grumby and I have concluded to have it down, by and by; as it is now, it is dangerous."            - "Iave it cut down, Sir Huston!" called out several voices; " we shall enjoy the fun!" "No, papa," said Isabella; "'let it remain just as it ' * is for a while." "Oh, no, my daughter ; it is best to have it removed; but you shall have my consent to erect a monument to his honorable memory."       / The girls laughed.' About two hours later in the day a couple of sturdy axe-mren waited beside the tree. Some of the ladies and gentlemen stood upon the ter- races to witness the fall, while others, the younger ones, went upon the ground. "I will stand here," said Isabella, walking a few paces nearer to where she thought the top of the old oak would reach. '"Not quite so near, Miss Falkstone, if you please," said her father, " unless you want a slight brush." She moved back a little way, and the axe-men began their work. A few lusty strokes, and it gave way, - a few more, --yet more, and, with a crackling, rustling  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7752-00000107"/> 212       JtUDGE NOT; "OR, sound, the giant oak was prostrate. A shout arose, and Isabella rushed forward, for the curious old nest which she and Hester had so often talked about was close before her, within her reach. ' Now," she cried, as she rushed forward, "I now I will see what it contains!" She poured forth one of her wild, joyous laughs, as she pressed herself in among the branches. She caught the branch eagerly, for others were trying to forestall her; but she gained; the nest was before her. She looked in it, - seized something,- and then, with a cry more piercing, more appalling, than that with which she had fled from the grave of her friend, she fell for- " ward. In the bottom of the magpie's nest - the little jewelled watch and the stolen ring were found. Pale, motionless as a grim statue of despair, the master of "West Oakland " looked upon his daughter still fallen, still clutching the jewels for which Hester had died. Quicker--quicker than the flashing light- ning the sad memories of those days crowded upon him. AAh! he again beheld that old man standing fearlessly before him, with pride, honesty, honor stamped upon his features, and a pale and trembling girl clinging, clinging in her anguish to his knees. And. what else? Did no other picture pass before his excited mind? Alas i yes; he saw upon a little bed in a prison-cell a beautiful, -crushed- dead girl. The truth, the fearful truth burst upon the inmates of "West Oakland " with more power, more awful power, than did the pealing thun- ders of the storm. It shook every nerve; it paled every   RESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     213 face; features looked blank it each other at the words "The magpie - it was the magpie - not the girl!" Ah! who among the old servants that liad been in Sir Richard's service and were acquainted with his fondness for tarnmi(ng birds, and watching particularly the pilfering propensities of the crow and magpie,- who among them could not now tell wonderful tales'? But there were none anong them able to bring back the past, -alas! none able to open the grave, and restore the child to her suffering parents ; -none! none. The grave will not give up its prey, death will not restore his victim.   . Rubens clasped his hands, and lifted his haggard face upward while he exclaimed, "Father, I bless thee that thou kept me free the cruelty. I did not condemn her even in the blackest hour of her trouble. Her name be free now, -r she be not dead.?' No, Hester was not dead; she was present then to each member of the family who had condemned her; yes, she stood before them with no blot upon her name. Can we wonder that Sir Huston Falkstone sought the retirement of his own chamber, and that his lofty head was bowed? Can we wonder at his daughter's anguish, when she remembered that she had hurried her friend to an early grave; that she, by false accusation, by hasty judgment,  had cut down so fair a -being in the bloom and brightness  of youth? We do not. Isabella might well suffer. The old gardener suddenly remembered-that he had seen the magpie perched upon the- railing of the bal- cony close to Miss Falkstone's dressing-room window        -   '   '  /   ",  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7752-00000108"/> 214       ^ JUDGE NOT." just before Hester had been seen to leave the mansion on the fatal morning when the little watch was lost. But the information came too late. "Why didn't I think to speak of it," said the old man, " when rd seed him, wey me hown heyes, carry off things before?" The mystery of the brilliant spray, - all could see through it plainly now. The thief had let it fall from his nest, and unfortunately it had been found at Hes- ter's feet.  Alas! too many graves are filled with victims! "Judge not!"For why should we judge our brother? Shall we not all be judged by and by? And what will our judgment be in that day when the books are opened and the "dead are judged out of the things which are written in the books according to their works "? Will there be clemency shown to us who had no mercy? Will not those who perished at our hands stand between us and the glory of the celestial city? "Judge not, that ye be not judged. .For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again."   CHAPTER XT:X HESTER'S INNOCENCE PROCLAIMPED. THE city spires were still lost in the morning mist, and the rising sun was struggling his way through the thick volumes which hung above, and even below, and could be felt clinging to one's very clothes. Lord Grumby had twice rung his bell, - twice gone to the chamber window to look out; but he saw noth- ing but mist, mist, gloomy mist everywhere. Impa-. tiently he gave ,a third pull to the bell, while he mapt- tered, "Confound that lazy rascal! I'll, rI'll- Bless me, Gibson, what's the matter? Didn't you hear my bell?" "In truth, me Lord, I did, yer honor," said Gibson; "but I thought you had mistaken the time, sir. It is not seven, my Lord!"

Do you understand?"

The coffee and hack were soon ready, and the man went to his lordship's room to offer services, and to find out what he could by observation. But he gained about 'as much as he ever did at such times. Lord Grumby understood servants well, and they rarely found much satisfaction when attempting to pry into his affairs. So Gibson quietly watched him gulp down his coffee, and then still wondering he ran out to open the cab door. A little before eight o'clock the same cab stopped at the garden-gate of the cottage on the King's Court Road, where Simon Powers, his wife, and Markham still resided. The old gentleman opened the gate and walked into the garden. He could scarcely believe that he was in the right place, at first, so great a change had taken place in its appearance. There were no briers, no thistles, no weeds to be seen. Flowers, fruits, and vegetables were flourishing all around; every bed was in the very perfection of order. Beautiful flowering vines crept over the trellised porch, and on each side of the door the rosemary grew; tulip and wall-flow- ers bloomed under the windows, and the sweet-scented hyacinth shed its fragrance all around. The hall door was open, and Lord Grumby, feeling himself still at home in a place once his own property, walked in without knocking. The little family had just taken their seats at the breakfast-table, --Nancy at the head, and her husband and son-in-law on either   HESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.    .217 side of her. Grumby was about to speak, when he ob- served that the old man was going to ask a blessing; so he lifted his hat and waited. There was something touching, almost holy, in the expression of Simon's face as he spoke; and even Lord Grumby felt as he looked on, that after all there was something beautiful, exalting in religion. When the blessing was concluded Markham caught sight of his patron's portly figure, as he again came toward the breakfast-room door. '* Why!" the young man exclaimed, springing from his chair, " this is a pleasant surprise indeed, my lord! Have you breakfasted?" The question was involuntary, and brought the quick blood to his face, for he suddenly recollected the dif- ference between the social positions of his guest and the old people at table. But Grumby was quick to perceive his thoughts, and said quickly, "My dear fellow, I'd as lief eat with them as with kings, and I tell'you I'm in good trim for a real substantial meal, and then above all things I want to know your two old friends. Glad to see you all so comfortable and well; you've made it a pleasant home. Fine fellow, very fine fellow you are, my dear boy! Come!"He preceded Markham into the room, and commenced a thorough shaking of hands with the old folks. "How-de-do! how-de-do!" he said; " sorry I haven't been out before,' but gout and business,- two con- founded things, - they hold a fellow tight, you know!" Lord Grumby had never before seen either Simon or his  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7752-00000110"/> 218      "JUDGE NOT;"OR,  wife; and, from what he had heard about them more than two years before, he looked upon them as almost an imbecile old pair.- He was, therefore, not a little sur- prised to find them quite intelligent. They talked well about outside matters first; and then Lord Grumby asked about the garden, the house-keeping, and things around him. "And you find this a pleasant and healthy place?" he said, addressing himself to Markham. ' Ah, my lord!" answered Simon, "there ben't a day that dawns that we don't bless- thee for being so good to us all in our trouble." "Don't speak of it! don't speak of- it!" said Lord Grumby. "It was scarcely worth having when- No, no! don't speak of such a trifle, I beg." "But it be due to you," said Simon, shaking his white head. "I found the gee'ern all growed over wey weeds, and I got out me tools and sot to work. It took my mind from my sorrow, sometimes. It helped me; and, between working and religion, sir, there come a sort of peace to us, after a while. Ah, my lord! religion be a good thing; it be a stay and comfort, and fetches to us always a sure peace. Nancy and I couldn't ha'e stood up in our trouble but for it; oh, no! there be joy in believing." Grumby could not help feeling impressed as the old man spoke, and he said with a smile, but with feelings he, perhaps, would not like to have shown then, "I will come here often, Simon. I  might find this a more profitable place to visit than my old club-rooms." He arose, and, drawing Markham's arm through his, said, "Come, I have something to say to you, my boy," and   RESTER POWERS' GIRLHOOD.     219 then, turning to the old people, he said, "I will see you again soon." The parlor was on the opposite side of the hall, the door of which stood open. "Step, in," Markham said, as they were passing; "we have just had it done up, - painted and so forth, and, to please the old people, I have stuck around a few pictures, you see." "Landscapes," said Lord Grumby. "I did not know you painted in that line so well." "Don't be too severe, my lord," said Markham, smil- ing. "Severe! I'm honest. The pictures are fine; and 'pon my honor, it puzzles me to know how you have been able to do so much in two little years." "I have been prospered, my lord, prospered beyond my most sanguine expectations.- I told you that I should be blessed! The two old people have been everything in the world to me, and for their sakes I have been blessed." "Markham, my noble boy, I should be proud to call you my son.  May your blessings be multiplied a    r thousand-fold! But what is this? This is not a land-  scape. Who is she? In the name of reason, did ever such a being live?" "Yes," said Markham, sadly; " that, my lord,"--he stopped a moment for he felt the old emotion arising within him,-" that, sir, is a true likeness of Hester Powers."                        : "What! Great heavens!" exclaimed Lord Grum-  by. "Did she look like that?"  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7752-00000111"/> 220      t "JUDGE NOT; "ORS, "That picture hardly does her justice," Markham said. :"She was beautiful,-very, very beautiful.'" "And could Falkstone commit her to prison forX crime? Oh, fool, fool that he was! His hasty judgment  brought a curse--a curse upon his house, a blight upon his own and his daughter's lives! Come here, my boy. Pull up your chair and let me hold your hand. I pity, I honor, I love you! with my whole soul I do! Don't tremble so. I'll be as gentle as I can,.but our hearts nor our words are as tender as woman's." Then the old gentleman stopped a moment, for there had come a redness about his eyes, and a choking sensa- tioa in his throat. "Well," he continued, at length, "I may as well tell you out plain. They know now L that she was innocent. The real thief has been found." For a little while the young man's blanched face was hidden in his handkerchief; but- presently he looked up; there was a smile upon his lips as he said, "Thank the Lord! thank the Lord for all his mercies  I knew this day would come; -but the world-thei world must know it."- ( To-morrow," said Lord Grumby, " to-morrow, my boy, the whole thing will be published by Falkstone's )wn request.

It would not bring  back to them their lost and only child, nor restore the young wife to her husband. No, no!"I "Now, my boy," continued the old gentleman, after a pause, "be tender to him, be slow of speech if you should ever meet him, for now he is weak, and you are strong. Oh! he is not the only sufferer; it will go hard with his daughter. So I say, my boy, return good for evil ; be gentle, for they believed that they were doing right. They believed her guilty. They couldn't see up into a magpie's nest, you know." ("A magpie's nest!" exclaimed Markham.  "Yes, my boy," said the old gentleman, brushing something from the corner of his eye, " it was a mag-  pie who carried off the jewels. And now, look you, nothing can bring  back or change that which has rolled by on the river of time,- nothing,--nothing!  Bear this as you did the deep affliction, - be patient, and rejoice that her name is free and pure." Markham pressed the old gentleman's hand and. said, through his tears, "It 'is the Lord. He hath dealt with us very mercifully.,"  The cab which had brought his lordship out to the  cottage still waited before the garden-gate, and after a little rambling through the garden with Simon, and - Nancy had gathered a nice little basket full of the ripest fruit, Lord Grumby bade them good-morning, promnis-  ing to come again very soon.              !!

Good-by." Markham and Grumby rode off toard the city to- gether. That same evening, as the little family sat together in the porch of their pretty home enjoying the twilight of the summer evening, Markham told the old people the news. Ah! it brought back very vividly "very painfully, the sad past. Yet, amid their tears they felt an inward joy that the time had come for Hes- ter's name to be cleared,--cleansed from the stain of crime; that they had lived to see the day whenher ac- cusers would proclaim her innocent. In a small, close room of a little house in a narrow street, in one of the most unhealthy and dismal parts of the great metropolis, there sat a feeble-looking wo- man. She had been ill, and was now slowly recover- ing; there was a fretful, peevish look upon her face, as a slovenly-looking girl brought her in the morning's paper. "Have the lodgers gone out ?" inquired the woman, in an ill-natured tone. "Yes, ma'am." "Then  bring me m  y breakfast; it must be ten "It isn't nine, ma'am ,"  ventured the girl. "I don't care hif 'taint  height bring me my break- fast. " Will you have toast and  a boiled egg, m a'am ?" The breakfast soon came. And, as the girl placed it   HESTER POWERS' aIRLHOOD.     223 before her crabbed mistress, she said, in a sort of sym- pathizing tone, " you was up most all night, ma'am, I reckon." "I should think I was!" was the answer.  It is Mrs. Roland, late maid to Miss Falkstone, in whose house we are, now, my reader. She had been feeling quite troubled, of late,- during her illness, par- ticularly. She had something upon her mind, which she sometimes determined to relieve herself of, and again, determined not to, according to her moods.         ; Wheh the girl went downstairs, she took 'up the pa- per, as she almost always did over her breakfast; but, before she had eaten two mouthfuls, she exclaimed,  "My goodness me!"  Her very lips turned white as she rapidly read down   i the column; for well she remembered the part she     / had played in the last drama of Hester's life.  In giving to the press the entire history of the affair which a second time had cast a gloom over the "West- l Oakland" mansion, the writer concluded by remarkingJ that the only thing yet in mystery relating to the jew-  els, and which still seemed to cast a doubt upon the L unfortunate girl's name, was, that the little emerald brooch was actually found in her possession ; " had that not been the case, she would not, in all probability,  have been committed to prison. That, at the timoe,  proved her guilt." "' "That proved her guilt!" exclaimed Roland, spring,- ing to her feet. "That proved her guilt Then H I am her murderer, for I placed it there      "!"

Roland, in her position as lady's maid, fre- quently found it convenient to appropriate some little article of finery belonging to her mistress such as fine laces andribbons. When the jewels were missed, she feared that a general search would be made, and that her misdeeds might be brought to light. Believing that Hester had taken the jewels, and would be careful' to place them in a secure hiding-place, she wickedlyplaced the emeraldbrooch in the girrs dress, for the purpose of establishing her guilt, and'to re- move all suspicion from herself.

The winter winds have swept over it, and some of its  ancient walls are beginning to crumble. The matted ivy clinging dismally around the turrets and gables gives to it a sort of dreary, forsaken look. Noone is seen about the place but the old house-keeper, the gardener, and Mr. Rubens.

A LOST LOVE. BY ASITFORD OWEN. 1 vol., 12mo. Elegant fancy Cloth, with a Portrait of the Berow Price $1.25, A few years ago a number. of American novel readers got hold of a modest little English volume, entitled "A Lost Love," by Ashford Owen, and spread its reputation greatly in private companies by adjuring all their acquaintances to read it. The book cannot fail to have a run, because it is thor- oughly original in spirit, incident, sentiment, and character, and though the farthest in the world from being Sa L sensa- tional" story, it will give the most blase novel reader a new sensation. It is a quietly intense representation of deep yet simple feeling and sentiment, in its development under unfa- vorable circumstances, and leaves on the heart a far finer ideal impression than most of the novels which do not equal it in reality and truth. We know nothing about the author, and it may be that his or her vein was exhausted in the pro- duction of a first book; but the vein itself, though it may be thin, is of pure gold. Read what the English Press says of it:- The London Athenaeum, says : I It is a story, full of grace and genius. We recommend our readers to get the book for them- selves. No outline of the story would give any idea of its beauty." The Saturday Review, says: "A striking, and original story: a work of genius and sensibility."  The Westminster Review, says: "A real picture of a woman's life; one who, while loving and thirsting to be loved, can give up her one hope in life, when sympathy and good sense demand the sacrifice.,- The Quarterly Review, says: "A novel of great genius; beauti- ful and true a s life itself. " The Press, says: "A tale at once moving and Winning, natural and romantic, and certain to raise all the finer sympathies of the reader's nature. Its deep, pure sentiment, and admirable style, will win. for it a lasting place in English fiction; as one of the truest and most touching pictures of woman's love."  &#xD;<pb n="226 (Advertisement) -227 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7752-00000114"/> THE GAYWORTHYS.  By the author of "FFATH GABKNJ'S GmILHOOD," "BOYS AT CHEQUASSET." EE nAm erican ladies and gentlemen travelling in England, are amazed and delighted to find " an American Novel" welcomed with such warmth and enthusiasm, by the "cultivated" and "influential," in all parts ot the Kingdom. No American book     since "I Uncle Tom,"  is so universally known, read, and talked about. The London journals, without exception, have given it a cor- dial welcome. Read what they say of it:- ("We wish to write our most appreciative word of this admirable and unexcep- tional book. We feel while we read it that a new master of fictionf has arisen. ,  .

"The Gayworthys' comes to us very seasonably, for it belongs to a class of novels wanted more and more every day, yet daily growing scarcer. We have, therefore, a warmer welcome for the book before us as being a particularly favora- ble specimen of its class.

The tone of the story, the curious sense of peace and kindliness which it produces, comes out well in that extract, and they reader quits it, feeling as he would have felt had he been gazing half an hour on that scene--with more confidence alike in nature and humanity, less care for the noisy rush of city life, and yet withal less fear of it. - Spectator. ^ "It is a pleasant book and will make for the producer friends." -Saturday Review. "We venture to say no one who begins the book will leave it unfinished, or will deny that great additions have been made to his circle of acquaintance. He has been introduced to a New England village, and made acquainted with most of the leading villagers in a way- which leaves the impression on him thenceforward that he knows them personally, that their fortunes and failures, and achievements, and misunderstandings are matters of interest to him, that he would like to know how Gershom Vose got on with his farm, and if Joanna Gair's marriage turned out: happily, and if ' Say' Gair was as interesting as a farmer's wife as she has been as a little child n   PIQUE: A Tale of the English    Aristocracy  . 1 vol., 12mo. Elegantfancy clot. Price $.75. Three thousand eight hundred and seventy-six new books were pubished in England this last year, whichl is about the average number of past years. Thirteen years ago PIQmz was first published in London, and up to the present time, notwithstanding the enormous number of new books issued, the effect of which is to crowd the. old ones out of sight, this remarkable novel has con- tinued to have a large sale. This is the strongest praise that can be bestowed on any book. It is not in the least "Sensational" but relies solely on its rare beauty of style and truthfulness to nature for its popularity. It has the merit of being amusing, pleasantly written, and engrossing.  The characters being high-bred men and women, are charming companions for an hour's solitude, and one puts the book aside regretfully, even as one closes the eyes on a deli- cious vision. The American edition has taken every one by surprise, that so remarkably good a novel should have so long escaped attention. Every body is charmed with it, and its sale will continue - for years to come.  &#xD;<pb n="228 (Advertisement) -229" xml:id="VAC7752-00000115"/> \\ TWICE LOST. v^  ^)  A NOVEL. B    y S. J Author of "L INNE T'S    TRIA L. READ THE OPINIONS OF THE ENGLISHt PRES$S A nother first-rate novel by a womanl The plot well conceived and worked out, the characters individualized and clear-cut, and the story so admirably told that you are hurried along for two hours and a half with a smile often breaking  out at the humor, a tear ready to start at the pathos, and with unflagging interest, till the'heroine's release from all trouble-is announced at the end. . . . We heartily recommend the book to all readers. It is more full ofT character than any book we remember since Charles Reade's C Christie Johnstone.' ' -Reader. "'Twice Lost is an entertaining novel; the struggle between the high-spirited, generous, half-savage heorine, and her specious, handsome, unprincipled, soi dlisant father, is exciting; and the sympathy of the reader is cleverly enlisted for Whe heroine, Lucia, from the first moment. The personages have all of them a certain look of reality, and there is a notion of likeness which insures the reader's interest. We can recommend ' Twice Lost ' as a novel worth reading.7" - Athenceum. !"By far the cleverest book on our list is ' Twice Lost.' . . . This is bold and- skilful drawing, and it is a fair sample of the earlier half of the volume. The combined vigor, ease, and perspicuity of the writing is unusual."'- Guardian, "Nothing can be better of its kind than the first portion of ' Twice Lost.' ...) The caustic humor and strong common sense which mark the sketches of charae. ter in this book, betray a keenness of observation and aptitude for producing a  telling likeness with a few strokes, which need only a wider cultivation to secure a more complete success than has been attained in ' Twice Lost.'" 4Westminster Review. "It is quite clear that the author has given a good deal of thought to the con. struction of the story, with a view to producing strong interest without the use of the common sensational expedients. To say that 'Twice Lost' is very well written, and very interesting, would not be doing it justice. - Morning Herald. "There can be no doubt of the author's power. She holds her characters and incidents well in -hand, writes firmly, and often very happily, and there are many paKfges which indicate power much above mediocrity." -London Review. "' Not very often do we meet with a novel so thoroughly good as 'Twice Lost.) If, as may be assumed from both subject and style, its author is a woman, she may at once be classed with the Bronte sisters and George Eliot. She has the firm conception and distinct touch of the first-class artist. Her characters are real and inhldividual.- Press. This is a well-written romantic tale, in which we fnd many pleasing incidents and some successful portraiture of character. The character of Miss Derwent, the companion and governess of the heroine, Miss Langley, is very well developed in the course of the narrative. The moral tone of the book is very good, and so far as religious matters are touched upon, they are treated with propriety and rever- ence."- English Churchman. "The characters are well drawn-the situations are new, the sentiments are unsentimental and the incidental remarks those of a clever woman who is rea- sonable and tolerant."-- Globe. "The plot of thls tale is an original one, and well worked out. ... We can sincerely recommend this tale; it is luite out of the general run of books, and is sure to prove an interesting one.2'- Observer. "We noticed this story because its authoress will one day, we believe, produce a powerful novel."-- Spectator. "The reader is carried along with unflagging and exciting interest, and the book is fill of characters finely sketched, and of passages powerfully written." -Patriot.
