               <head>I. JOHN CLIFFORD'S WIFE.</head>
               <p>JUNO CLIFFORD stood before the mirror of her richly furnished breakfast parlor. The cloth had been spread for a half-hour—the silver coffee service was prettily arranged, and the delicate cups of Sèvres porcelain were scattered around the urn. But the mistress of the mansion had only just arisen. It was ten o'clock. Men, whose business hours had commenced, were hurrying to and fro in the street—the city was teeming with life and turbulent with noise, but the hum only stole through the heavily-curtained windows of that <unclear>lofty</unclear> house on Mount Vernon street, with a subdued cadence that was very pleasant. It was a lounging, indolent attitude, in which the lady stood. In her whole style of manner<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7298-00000005"/> there was a kind of tropical languor, and it was easy to see that she was seldom roused from her habitual calmness. And yet there was something in the curving of her dainty lips, the full sweep of her arching brows, nay, in every motion of her hand, which told of a slumbering power; an energy, resistless in its intensity; a will that might have subjugated an empire. The indolence was habitual—the energy, native.</p>
               <p>She was not yet twenty-five, and very beautiful. Her eyes were large, black, and melting; her complexion so clear in its cool olive, that you could see the blue veins beneath it, and over her neck and shoulders fell, like a cloud, the heavy waves of her black hair. Her figure was very full, but exquisite in its proportions, with the falling shoulders, the dimpled arms, and the Grecian curve of the graceful neck. She was nobly born, and yet poor; and this was why she was John Clifford's wife. He was nearly twenty years older than herself, and he loved his beautiful flower of the South, with a passionate tenderness, but poorly requited by the cold and formal bestowal of her hand. Somehow there was an empty place in his heart—a nook where her voice had never entered—a temple where sometimes he retreated, stealing away from the fashionable, bustling life she led him, and bowed in secret before a divinity of his own—the ideal semblance of a true woman, whose world was home, whose heart was her husband's. This ideal woman was very simply clad; Juno Clifford would have protested against having such a common-looking person in the house, and perhaps this was why John always worshipped her in secret, and never even mentioned her to his wife, or any of her fashionable friends.</p>
               <p>There was, for a broker of forty-five, and a hardworking man of business, a good deal of romance stored away somewhere, low down in John Clifford's heart. There were deep founts of tenderness there, too, but no one cared to sound their depths, and so John lived on very quietly. His name was excellent on State street; his word as strong as any other man's bond, and by his compeers in business, he was held in high esteem. At home, his favorite cook paid due regard to his tastes, his meals were well served, his wife well-dressed, and his friends well entertained. It was certainly very foolish of John, ever to wish, as he sometimes did, that he wasn't quite so, wealthy; that he had a cozy room where, with a carpet that easy-chairs wouldn't hurt, a round table, and a wife that would come at odd times, when he was very tired, and brush his hair back, or drop a gentle kiss upon his brow, and then sit down by his side, for a quiet talk!</p>
               <p>Certainly this vision of an imaginary wife was very singular. Juno Clifford never thought of such<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7298-00000006"/> a thing, and, least of all, this clear December morning, when she stood before her mirror, waiting for her husband, and her breakfast, and deliberating in her own mind, the very grave question, whether a garnet-colored velvet, trimmed with ermine, or a sky blue satin, spangled with silver stars, would best adorn her regal beauty, at Mrs. Ashburton's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bal costumé.</foreign> At length she decided upon the satin, and winding her hair around her head, like a turban, she drew her crimson dressing-gown about her, and walked thoughtfully to the fire. It was an odd fancy of John Clifford's, the lady mused, that he wouldn't have his house heated with furnaces, like a Christian, but must needs use grates, to the utter disregard, as she persuaded herself, of time and labor, and most certainly of fashion. She couldn't understand the strange way he had of sitting, by the half-hour, with his eyes fixed on the glowing embers, making pictures, as he called it. She was leaning her elbow on the mantel, absorbed in a profound meditation on this important subject, when suddenly the door opened, and she was face to face with her husband.</p>
               <p>"John Clifford! My goodness, John! What <emph>have</emph> you brought home now?" and she curled her haughty lip, and stared in wonder, at a tattered, miserable-looking little fellow, who stood shivering, just within the door.—"Why don't you speak, John? Who is he?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know that myself, sweet wife. I found him hawking papers, and there was something in his deep eyes, and the clear, melancholy tones of his voice, that drew me to him in spite of myself. I wish to keep him awhile. Have you any objections? He needn't be in your way, and I'm sure he'll make himself useful."</p>
               <p>The lady made no reply for a moment. She glanced at the boy with an earnestness rather unusual to her manner. He was a frightful-looking object, very small for his age, with a thin, slight figure, and the tiniest of little, half-starved looking hands. There seemed to be something in his aspect which touched even Juno Clifford's worldly heart. "I don't know," she said at length, "I'm sure I don't know what is to be done with him. One couldn't fancy such a miserable looking child round one, but then if <emph>you</emph> want such pets, I have no special objection. Ring the bell, please, I begin to have a fancy for my breakfast."</p>
               <p>"Jane," she continued, in a tone of absolute authority, to the waiting maid who answered the summons, "tell Scipio to bring up breakfast, and do you take out this child, and have him dressed decently. There are some of Maxwell Clifford's clothes in the red-room bureau. When he is made decent, you can give him his breakfast."</p>
               <p>The servant to whom these commands were addressed<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7298-00000007"/> dressed, was her own especial maid, the child of her foster-mother. Mrs. Everett Stanley was distinguished in the annals of the Stanley family for nothing in the world but being the mother of our lady Juno. She was a blue-eyed mite of womanhood, with a very pitiful face, that always looked as if she had been crying, and just finished washing the tears off. She died some five or six days after Juno first opened her great black eyes. I always believed she breathed out life from sheer astonishment that a child of hers should have such eyes. And then, besides, Juno was one of those babies who are fully determined on being heard, as well as seen, and the effect of her full, clear soprano tones, must have been disastrous on such weak nerves as Mrs. Stanley's. Col. Stanley was a planter, in southern Louisiana, the descendant of a noble race. Nothing remained to the family, however, of the grand fortune of their ancestors, but their name, the hereditary mansion, and a few slaves. To the care of one of these, the infant Juno was confided. Her quadroon maid was, as I have said, the child of this same nurse. Col. Stanley had died before his daughter's marriage, and from the wreck of his involved estate, this favorite servant was her sole inheritance. She was scarcely less beautiful than her mistress, and Juno liked to have beautiful things about her. Gifted by nature with the peculiar talents and graces of her mixed race, the quadroon possessed not only unrivalled skill and taste in matters of the toilet, but she could play the guitar like a daughter of Spain, and dance till you would have deemed her a visible incarnation of the poetry of motion. The tie between a mistress and the servant who has been cradled on the same breast, is one which a Northerner can scarcely comprehend, but it existed between Juno and her favorite attendant, to its fullest extent. The girl loved her mistress with a passionate devotion. From earliest infancy she had been accustomed to the most absolute submission to every caprice of Juno's wayward, imperious nature. When Juno Stanley became Juno Clifford, she refused to accept 'the freedom that might have been hers, and residing in the very capital of a free state, she was as much a slave as ever. Her hand draped the damask curtains of the young wife's boudoir, her low, sweetly modulated voice read aloud the volumes with which Mrs. Clifford's habitual indolence would otherwise have prevented her from becoming acquainted. Juno Clifford had a tropical taste, and an exquisitely keen and fastidious sense of the beautiful, and she quite prided herself on the rare grace of her personal attendant. Secure in her own consciousness of superior charms, her eyes lingered approvingly on the dusky, shadow-like face of the quadroon. It was a perfect picture to see the mistress and her maid within the boudoir.</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7298-00000008"/>
               <p>The chief characteristic of Juno's beauty was its majesty—on the other hand, the quadroon's was distinguished for softness. Juno sat for hours, in her high-backed crimson chair, her feet half buried in cushions of eider down, absorbed in fits of interminable musing. At such times, the quadroon would lie upon her cushions at the other end of the apartment, and watch her steadily with her great mournful brown eyes. Juno would seldom permit her to employ herself, save about her own person, so she would lie there idly, with her guitar by her side, and her large languishing eyes upturned. There was a dreamy grace about her, quite indescribable, aided perhaps by the soft fabrics and glowing hues of her favorite costumes, so that she adorned the apartment, and pleased the eye of its mistress, like a beautiful picture.</p>
               <p>Juno Clifford ate her breakfast, that morning, with an air a shade or two more thoughtful and subdued than usual. Her husband looked at her across the table, with a glance whose language was almost worship, and when he arose, the tone in which he said—"Good-bye, my wife Juno," was really humble in its earnest tenderness. There was something of reverence, too, in the silent, half-timid kiss he pressed upon her brow. She touched the bell, as he went out, and then, contrary to her usual habit, sat down to watch the clearing away of the breakfast things.</p>
               <p>As she sat there, the quadroon entered, and passing behind her chair, commenced looping up the heavy waves of her hair. At length a surly "you're in the way," from Scipio, attracted Mrs. Clifford's attention toward the boy, who had entered the room unperceived, and was quietly standing there, looking around with his anxious eyes, as if in search of occupation.</p>
               <p>"You gave him some breakfast, Jane?" the lady said, inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"I tried to, madam, but I could not make him eat any thing. He only swallowed a few mouthfuls, and then burst into tears, saying he couldn't eat, when they were all starving at home."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clifford looked at him more attentively. He was twelve years old, but, as I said, very small of his age. His features were regular, the blue eyes large and clear, with a curve of gentle determination about the pleasant mouth. Guido would have copied Ida face, if he had seen it, for a child-head of the beloved disciple. There was an innate nobility in his expression, albeit it was slightly tinctured by that eager, half-famished look which poverty never fails to leave as her terrible signet, on the face of childhood. The quadroon had attired him with singular taste. She had selected a costume from a collection of fancy dresses, the property 'of John Clifford's nephew, Master Maxwell Clifford, who had been staying in the house. His<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7298-00000009"/> complexion looked dazzlingly pure and fair, in contrast with the slashed doublet of purple velvet, and the picturesqueness of his whole aspect charmed Juno Clifford's artistic eye, at the first glance. She called him to her side, and he drew near, and stood at her knee, looking up into her face with a kind of wonder, as one might look at an angel, if a summer cloud should chance to open, and give to mortals a momentary glance into the blue beyond.</p>
               <p>The lady bent over him for a moment, and brushing back the faded, sun-burnt curls of his bronze hair, looked into his clear eyes. "What is your name?" she said at length.</p>
               <p>"Warren Hereford," was the reply, in a low and musical tone.</p>
               <p>"Well, Warren, would you like to stay here with me always?"</p>
               <p>The boy stood in silence for a time, with a look of intense thought on his delicate features. At length he lifted his eyes to her face. There was a singular expression in them, partly of eager delight, partly of doubt, and partly of the old hopeless sorrow. "I don't know," he said—"I should like it if I only could. Oh, if I <emph>could</emph> stay with you always, I should feel just like heaven, you are so beautiful, but they are all so poor at home, mother, and Dick, and Emmie, and little Mabel—I must stay there and help them."</p>
               <p>"Where do you live?" she asked very softly, for there was a wordless appeal in his glance, his tone, his up-raised face, that her heart could not resist, and beside that, her vanity was pleased and flattered, by his homage to her beauty. The fervent admiration of the boy was so fresh, so unworldly, so different from the hackneyed compliments of her fashionable friends. It opened in that moment a glimpse of a new and keen pleasure for her epicurean taste, and with her usual impulsive waywardness, she formed a sudden resolution that he should be hers, her child; that this new delight should continue with her, and she would deepen his homage into love. He still stood there, in a kind of dreamy silence, and she repeated her question—"Where do you live?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>There!</emph>" he answered, slowly, almost painfully. "I couldn't make you understand where, if you've never been out of this," and his glance seemed to take in the handsome room, with all its elegant appointments. "It's a long way from here, where I don't think you ever went. I don't like it, and mother don't like it, but we have to stay there because we are poor. Did you ever know any one that was poor, lady?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clifford did not answer. She seemed revolving some plan in her mind, and at length she asked, with evident interest, "Warren, if you could do something to get your mother and sisters a pleasant<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7298-00000010"/> sant home, and make them comfortable, would you be willing to go where you would never see them, to forget them altogether?"</p>
               <p>"I couldn't <emph>make</emph> myself forget, if it didn't come of itself, but I would go any where, or do any thing that ever I could, just to make mother well again, and see them all happy."</p>
               <p>"Very well, I will try you. Your mother will wonder where you are, and we will go to see her together this afternoon."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>II. MY SON'S MOTHER.</head>
               <p>AT precisely three o'clock, Juno Clifford's elegant private carriage drew up before her husband's office in State street. The steps were let down, and the lady alighting, swept with the mien of an empress across the pave, through the front room, and into John Clifford's private counting-room. "Business hours are over, I suppose?" she said, briefly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, we were just closing."</p>
               <p>"Well, I want you to go with me to Eliot street. The boy you brought home is in the carriage, and I am going to see his mother. I suppose it's a necessary form. It's the best way to satisfy him, and then we can adopt him with entire safety."</p>
               <p>"Adopt him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, wasn't that what you brought him home for? You've been teasing me these three years about adopting a child. You had Max Clifford round till I got tired to death of him. I've never been willing to take any one before, but this child interests me, and we will have him."</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7298-00000011"/>
               <p>"Well, certainly, if <emph>you</emph> wish it, wife. I don't know but we may as well adopt this boy as another. He pleased me very much when I saw him hawking papers, and I told him, when I brought him home, that I would find something better than that for him to do. But we won't be hasty. We can take him on trial for a time, and then, if we like him, we can legally adopt him. We had better not make any rash promises."</p>
               <p>They were all alone in the counting-room, and the proud woman bent suddenly, and pressed her lips to her husband's brow. It was so strange a thing for her to do this—it had happened not more than once or twice during the seven years of their married life, and it moved him greatly. His eyes grew so dim, he could hardly see her beauty, as she said in a low tone, very sweet and touching, "My husband, God has given me no child to love. This one pleased me, and I want him now. I have so many long, lonely hours to pass, and I need something to love, do I not, John?"</p>
               <p>"But you didn't like him when I brought him home."</p>
               <p>"I like him now. John, I don't ask favors very often. You <emph>will</emph> give me <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte blanche</foreign> to promise this boy's mother whatever may be necessary?"</p>
               <p>"I will. God knows, my beautiful, all I can do will be little enough to reward you for the sacrifice you made, in dowering with your youth, and your fresh loveliness, a worn and wearied man, twice your own age. I could not die in peace, if I had left one thing undone, to make you happy!"</p>
               <p>As the showy equipage rolled on, Juno Clifford sat in silence, leaning her head against the velvet cushions of the carriage. Her long lashes were drooped over her eyes, as if to shut in their expression, lest it should betray some cherished secret. It was a beautiful picture; Juno ought to have seen it herself, for she was fond of pictures. John Clifford sat there opposite, with his back toward the horses, taking it all in, and reproducing it to hang upon the walls of his heart. His forehead thrilled yet, with the kiss she had given him, and his pulses quickened at the unusual memory. In that hour he had no thought for the ideal woman, the imaginary wife. Mrs. Clifford always dressed well, and the rich ermine that lay about her throat, and swept down to her feet, along with the velvet folds of her cloak, imparted to her complexion a singular brilliancy. The fur cap of the Russian ladies, which so few can wear to advantage, suited well the haughty style of her classic face; and from under her drooped lashes shot flashes of light that seemed fairly to kindle the band of jewels which confined it under her chin. The boy, still in his fancy costume, sat silently beside her. Ah, it was indeed a splendid picture—the contrast<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7298-00000012"/> between them—the lady, proud, defiant, stately, and so beautiful—the fair, spiritual-looking child, with his clear, earnest eyes, his pale face, and his loving expression.</p>
               <p>The boy had been looking silently from the window for some moments. "It is here," he said at length, and once more the carriage stopped, and Juno Clifford drew the folds of her cloak about her. "Stay here for a while," she said briefly to her husband, and following the child, she descended to the pavement. It was an old rickety house before which the carriage stopped—a rambling, irregular wooden building, that seemed looking mournfully at every passer-by, and asking permission to fall down and rest, which nobody had time to give. The child climbed up one flight of stairs after another, looking around every now and then at "the angel," as he called Juno, in his heart. Poor little thing, he hadn't been so long out of heaven, but he had forgotten how it looked there.</p>
               <p>At last, he pushed open a door, and Juno stepped quickly to his side. She paused, however, for a moment, and lifting up her long lashes, allowed her eyes to take in the whole scene. There had been a time when <emph>she</emph> had been portionless, but she had never shaken hands with real poverty. Now, its aspect did not so much touch her heart, as it excited her curiosity. The house had evidently been built for the abode of wealth. Perhaps feet as light as thine, my lady Juno, have trod that crumbling floor; other eyes as dark, and glorious, may have counted the carved lilies on the oaken wall; but the bounding feet were still long ago, and if the dark eyes open ever so widely, they can only see the coffin lid. Didst ever think of that, my lady Juno?</p>
               <p>There was the tiniest bit of a fire, in the great fire-place, wide and stately enough to have held Yule logs at Christmas time. A few half-kindled chips were striving, as all fire strives, to send up their flame toward heaven, but the heaps of rubbish on top of them, choked it down, and turned it awry. I suppose thoughtful people would have traced an analogy, and remembered the tiny little flame of love to God, which our warden angels strive so hard to kindle, and how the dust and rubbish of this world's pomp and circumstance, so often choke it back again. But Juno Clifford was no analogist, and she stood there merely taking in the picture.</p>
               <p>There was a slight, graceful woman sitting in a low chair beside the embers. She was very pale and delicate, and her blue eyes rested with a look of sorrowful abstraction on the child in her arms. The little one might have been five years old, and, begging Master Warren's pardon, she looked a great deal more like an angel than Juno Clifford. Her brow was indescribably pure. It seemed almost luminous<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7298-00000013"/> minous, the blue veins shone through it so distinctly. Around it lay rings of golden hair, in short, clustering curls. Her mouth and chin were very calm, and a sweet, serene patience made her face even more remarkable than her beauty. Her eyes were of the same clear blue as her brother's, and they were turned steadily toward the fire. About both mother and children, there was, spite of their poverty, an air of patrician grace and refinement, which was unmistakable. At the mother's feet sat a girl of seven little Emmie Hereford. There was but one adjective needed to describe Emmie's face. It was emphatically sunny. You just saw that she had brown hair, and brown eyes of precisely the same shade, but all you noticed was the sunshine. It fairly flooded the great bare room, and lighted up the dingy walls with something better than the warmest firelight. She was singing when they opened the door, singing a carol of the merry harvest time, in the midst of that grim, bare poverty, when the very name of harvest-time, on any other lips than those so young, so hopeful, would have seemed a mockery.</p>
               <p>"Mother, sweet mother," cried Warren's voice, as he sprang into the room. Juno's cheek flushed, as she heard the exclamation. Already she loved him enough to feel a pang of jealousy, at being forgotten, even for a moment, but it passed away as quickly as it came. He had only pressed one kiss on his mother's wasted cheek, and the innocent brow of the little one upon her lap, when he rose to his feet, and, pointing to the door, said reverently, as one should announce an empress,—"Mother, that is Mrs. Clifford—the angel, mother!"</p>
               <p>The mother rose with an air of quiet propriety, which circumstances had no power to affect, and offering her chair to her visitor seated herself upon a bench at a little distance. Juno Clifford might have made a star actress. She had quick perceptions of character, and never failed to fascinate where the prize to be gained was worth the effort. On this occasion her husband would scarcely have known her. She was so quiet and gentle, so far removed from her usual hauteur and reserve, that John Clifford, if he had been watching her, might have fancied his imaginary "Wife had just stepped out of her common, every-day garb, and taken possession of Juno's velvet and ermine. Calling Warren to her side, she laid her hand upon his curls, and keeping him there, won Mrs. Hereford to unfold her history. It was by no means an uncommon one.</p>
               <p>Her husband had been the younger son of a noble English family, and was educated for the church. But when he found that his own heart was wanting in devotion to his calling, the highest, and most indispensable qualification, he had quietly, but firmly, refused to take orders. This step had effectually<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7298-00000014"/> tually alienated him from his family, and the breach was widened by his marriage with the daughter of a poor curate. "I brought him nothing," she said meekly, "but a true, loving heart, and a face that to his partial eyes seemed fair. I ought never to have married him, but we <emph>loved</emph> each other so." She paused, and the tears fell slowly and very quietly upon her clasped hands. A fierce frown, which she bowed her head to conceal, contracted Juno Clifford's features for a moment. A picture rose before her of <emph>another</emph> bridal,—of youth and beauty bartered away for gold, and her perjured, loveless heart beat tumultuously, clamoring for a rest that came not.</p>
               <p>They had been very happy for a few years, Mrs. Hereford continued, looking up through her tears—very happy. Three bright, smiling children made light and music in their frugal home, and her Edward's love had never failed her. At last a fourth little one slept upon her breast, the one she held there now, her little Mabel. But Mabel was hopelessly, incurably blind. This was their first real sorrow. Then her father died. They had shared his humble dwelling ever since their marriage; but a new curate came, and they went forth again, with the whole world before them, where to choose a home or a grave. Edward had been educated solely with a view to the ministry. His organization was too delicate for physical labor, and but few avenue of employment were open before him. They went to London, and for nearly two years he gained a bare pittance for himself and his family, by constant exertions as a copyist. At last, what with severe labor, mental uneasiness, and bad air, his health gave way, and he failed rapidly. They had never been bitterly poor before, but now Edward was reduced to part with a diamond cross, the last gift of his dead mother, which he had sacredly preserved through all his misfortunes. With the money thus obtained, nearly three hundred pounds, they resolved to emigrate to America. It was represented as a kind of Eldorado in those clays, and under the influence of his new hopes, Edward's health began to revive, as soon as he had engaged their passage. The voyage was an unusually long one, and they had not been a week at sea, before she once more perceived that he was failing rapidly. The blind Mabel was confided to the care of the eldest child, Warren; thoughtful even then beyond his years; and the anguished wife passed day and night in anxious watching by her husband's side. On the seventh day he died. They were in mid-ocean—not so much as a green island dotted its bosom. There was no grave for him but the waves. The sea-sand must draggle in his bright hair, the sea monsters wrap their slimy coils about the breast where, for so many years, her head had rested. There was madness in the thought. She<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7298-00000015"/> threw herself at the captain's feet and pleaded, with clasped hands and dry stony eyes, that strove to weep and could not, that they would let her keep him—only let her keep him, till she could lay him in a grave on shore—where she could come sometimes and press her lips to the green mound, and plant flowers on it. But to her wild prayer there was no answer, no amen. The waves closed over him, and the ship passed on, making no pause for the ocean burial; going on her way like a thing of life and beauty, as if there were no waves but the waves of ocean—no sorrow, and no prayer.</p>
               <p>The mother stood alone, with her fatherless children, on a foreign shore. "Would she have a carriage?" "Where would she go?" They were questions which she knew not how to answer. She stood there with her blind girl in her arms, and the rest around her, in a tide of troubled thought. Edward had meant to settle in Boston. He had an old friend there, a prosperous merchant, and there would be a melancholy satisfaction in seeking his friend, in following the course the dead one had marked out.</p>
               <p>Two days after, she sat in a quiet room at the Tremont House. She had gone thither at the suggestion of the captain, who supposed her wealthy Her little girls lay sleeping on the low French bed, Emmie's brown curls floating over the golden rings of Mabel's hair. Their little hands were clasped together, and Emmie's arm was wound protectingly round her sister's neck. Warren and Richard seemed to feel instinctively that she chose to be left to herself, and they stood quietly at the window, watching the people below, and the lights in the shops. The mother's musings were as perplexing as they were painful. She had four children, and not more than nine hundred dollars in the world. She thought till her brain throbbed, but she could see no means of support. Were she alone, she might perhaps advertise for a situation as governess, but even then she would have no recommendations. And yet—a hopeful thought dawned upon her. She rang for writing materials and a directory. Turning the leaves with her trembling fingers, she very soon ascertained the address of her husband's friend; a dainty, lady-like looking note was written and directed to Mark Sutherland, Esq., Beacon street.</p>
               <p>The next day, at the fashionable calling hour, Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland were announced. The lady was very showy, and somewhat handsome. Mr. Sutherland was a mild-looking, middle-aged gentleman, with an expression of much civility in his light eyes, that always seemed to say—"By your leave, sir; if you please, madam." His head looked so sleek, you would have imagined every individual one of his iron-gray hairs was trying to compress itself into<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7298-00000016"/> the smallest possible space, just to get out of other people's way. The lady greeted Mrs. Hereford with almost oppressive cordiality, and eagerly insisted that they should leave the hotel at once, and become her guests, until they had time to look up a satisfactory residence. Mr. Sutherland's face expressed as much gratification at his wife's cordiality as such a face could express. He asked a few timid questions about his old friend, and then Mrs. Hereford managed to tell them the object with which they had sailed for America, and how small was the sum on which lay her sole dependence. She expressed a wish that they could assist her in getting scholars, or in some way procuring a livelihood. Mr. Sutherland coughed a very sympathetic cough, and lifted his meek eyes to his wife in a mute appeal, as it seemed, for permission to assist the widow of his old friend. But it was quite lost upon his good lady. She, righteous soul, was pouring out sympathetic discourse like wine. She knew no opportunity indeed to get scholars, but perhaps Mrs. Hereford could open a thread and needle store, she had heard of such things being done by ladies in reduced circumstances. She hoped Mrs. Hereford would not fail to recollect that resignation was a Christian duty, and so saying, she went away, without renewing her invitation.</p>
               <p>There was no help to be hoped for in that quarter and the lonely English woman was compelled to make a confident of her landlord. By his assistance, she procured a cheap boarding-place, and employment at plain sewing. But her wants were many, and her strength small. The scanty remnant of her fortune diminished daily, and she had sunk, step by step, to penury. "I do not know why I have told you all this," she concluded, "but you seemed to sympathize in my distress. For the last three weeks I have been too weak and ill to accomplish any thing, and with four children looking up to me for bread, I can no longer afford to be proud. I have not so much money in the whole world as would pay for this desolate apartment a week longer. We have tasted food but once in the last twenty-four hours. This morning Warren and Dick both left me, with high hopes of earning money enough to get some supper, and Dick, poor, patient child, has not yet returned."</p>
               <p>Juno Clifford sat in silence for a moment, after Mrs. Hereford ceased speaking; then she drew a card from her card-case, and wrote a hurried request to her husband that he would send at once to the nearest shops for all the necessaries of a comfortable supper. "Go, Warren," she said, gently, "hand this to Mr. Clifford, and return again after a few moments."</p>
               <p>Then she turned to Mrs. Hereford, and said, in a low, earnest tone, "Rich as you may have thought<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7298-00000017"/> me, I, too, suffer. I am poorer in heart than you can ever be, for I have no child to love me. Will you give me Warren?"</p>
               <p>"He is my oldest son, lady; his dead father's pride, and my chief dependence for the future."</p>
               <p>"But I love him. I will do more for him than you could ever hope to do. Would you have your children grow up in ignorance, and perhaps die of starvation before your eyes, when, by parting with him, you might provide for them all? I do not ask you to do this for nothing. I will give you a pleasant home, and a comfortable support. He shall be educated as our own child, and cared for, by my husband and myself, as if indeed he were of our own blood. We will give him our name, and make him the heir to our fortune."</p>
               <p>"Should I see him often?" the mother asked with mournful resignation.</p>
               <p>Juno's brow darkened, but her self-command was wonderful, and she still retained her sweet, persuasive accents. "You would hardly ask <emph>that,</emph>" she said, gently. "Mr. Clifford would never consent to it, nor indeed could I. We want him for his love, and we never could bring him to regard us as his parents, if he saw you often. Think what a future lies before you, and consider if it would not be better to give up this one child, and do without his presence, than to bring them all up in want and misery? With us, his fortune will be brilliant, as even his father could have hoped. My husband has a little farm on the banks of the Mohawk River. It is a sweet place, thirty miles west of Albany. I have been there once, and no one could desire a fairer home. You shall have it rent free, and each year you shall receive four hundred dollars, payable quarterly. In return, I ask but for Warren. You will not be under a single obligation. I want the boy, and his love will be worth more than all I could do for you, to my empty, childless heart."</p>
               <p>The mother threw herself upon her knees. For a moment she sobbed bitterly. Then she lifted toward heaven her streaming eyes, and a prayer trembled upon her lips, very brief, very fervent, that God would help her to decide aright. Then rising, she walked back and forth across the floor, with feeble steps. An age of agony swept over her soul in those few moments. Could she give him up, she asked herself again, and again—her first-born, beautiful son? Could she have him called by another name, her Edward's boy, the descendant of the proud race of Hereford? And oh, worst of all, must she live to know that she was no longer remembered, that his lips were calling another one his mother, and his heart had forgotten the first love of his babyhood. Would it not be easier to see his bright head shut down beneath the coffin-lid? Alas, if he should<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7298-00000018"/> die, she had not money enough in all the world to buy a coffin! And then her frightened heart reproached her with selfishness. Would not they all rise up and condemn her, if she suffered this passionate mother's love to deprive him of the bright future opening before him; to consign them to a life of poverty and wretchedness, whose sweetest goal would be a nameless mound in the pauper's graveyard? This thought decided her. She resolutely choked back her tears, and turning to Mrs. Clifford, she said, in a tone of forced calmness, "I have no choice left, with these helpless, suffering ones around me. He shall answer for himself. Poor as I am, I will not <emph>send</emph> my boy from me, but if he will go willingly, then take him, and may Heaven give your kindness such a reward as I never can."</p>
               <p>"Be it so! He shall decide. I hear his foot upon the stairs." It was strange how soon Juno had learned to catch the sound of that child's footstep; she who, after seven years of married life, could not distinguish her husband's tread from the footfall of her black servants. Warren entered, and, of his own accord, resumed his old place at Juno's side, and once more, with one hand resting upon his head, and the other imparting a kind of subtle magnetic influence, by the caressing motion with which it moved backward and forward over his small palm, the lady asked him if he would like to live with her always. She told him briefly of the proposal she had made to his mother, and then she said, "I will love you, Warren, as fondly as your own mother ever could, and 1 need you more than she does, for I have no other child to love. If you come to us, you will be the means of making all your dear ones comfortable and happy, and you will be educated to become every thing your father could have wished. You are not to see or write to your mother, or your family. This will be better for them as well as you. It is a great sacrifice, I know, but can you not make it for their sakes? Will you go with me?"</p>
               <p>There was a struggle in the boy's heart. He grew pale as death. His eyes turned with a look of anguished tenderness on the faces of his mother and his sisters. But Juno Clifford triumphed. He put back the hand he had withdrawn from her clasp, and said, quietly, but still firmly—"<emph>I will go with you.</emph>" Thus was made the life election of the adopted son.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clifford's point was gained, but she still preserved the singular gentleness of her demeanor. When her husband entered, followed by a servant bearing a bundle of faggots and a hamper of provisions, she quietly explained the promises she had made, and called on him to confirm them. Then telling Mrs. Hereford she would make arrangements the next day for their removal to comfortable lodgings out of the city, and in the spring they should<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7298-00000019"/> be sent to Mohawk village, she bade her a kind good bye. "You will come to me in the morning, Warren," she said as she went out. "You may spend this last night with your mother."</p>
               <p>Once in the carriage, Juno Clifford's acting was over. She threw herself back on the cushions, and declared she was fagged to death; that really she never went through such a tiresome piece of work in her life; that she was glad that it was well over, and she hoped, now she had adopted a son at last, Mr. "Clifford would be satisfied. And, listening to these words, some of the blessedness her kiss had left upon his brow passed away, and leaning back on the cushions opposite, he invoked once more that fair picture of his imaginary wife, and thought how, if she were with him, it might have been that if God gave them children by birth or by adoption, she would have knelt by his side, and prayed for grace to train the soul for heaven. But she was not there, and turning away his eyes from Juno's face John Clifford breathed the prayer alone.</p>
               <p>Left to themselves, the little family in Eliot street forgot, for a time, the provisions and the firewood of which they stood in such pressing need, and remained huddled around the embers in silent thought. Mabel's face was hidden upon the mother's shoulder; Warren knelt beside her, with his head bowed upon her lap, and even the gay, light-hearted Emmie, leaning against her knee, was fairly sobbing. At last they were roused from their reverie, by a slow, half-hesitating step upon the stair, and Dick Hereford entered. He was a fine, manly-looking little fellow, fully as large as Warren, though two years younger He came slowly in, and going up to his mother's chair, said, in a despairing accent—"Mother, I have made but sixpence; we shall starve at this rate." Then his eyes fell upon Warren, and he exclaimed, "Why, where have <emph>you</emph> been, Ware? You must surely have done better than I. How came you by those handsome clothes?"</p>
               <p>With an inward prayer for strength, the mother unfolded the events of the afternoon. Dick seemed to enjoy the tidings. His spirit was naturally hopeful and courageous, and, to him, the forthcoming prosperity of the family was a matter of unqualified</p>
               <p>"Give us your hand, old fellow," he exclaimed, with an assumed manliness, which was very amusing in the boy of ten. "Give us your hand and see if you can't look thankful at the good fortune that's coming to you. I don't see any thing to look so solemn about. Of course you can come to see us, and we'll all write to you!"</p>
               <p>"No, that is it," and the mother's tone trembled<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7298-00000020"/> —"we cannot write him, and we are not going to see him any more."</p>
               <p>A shadow stole over the boy's face, when at length he comprehended the full force of the separation; but with a cheerfulness, evidently assumed for his mother's sake, he said, gayly—"Well, any way, if we must be sober, we'll have a good supper to help us bear it."</p>
               <p>In five minutes he had kindled a nice fire in the great fire-place and extracted from the hamper a loaf of bread, a pie, a paper of tea, and a small box of sugar. "There's some meat there, mother, dear," he said, in his good, cheerful voice; "if you'll cook it, I'll be off after some water, and put the kettle boiling."</p>
               <p>It was such a supper as they had not tasted in many months. Mrs. Hereford strove to conquer her emotions, and at least to appear to enjoy it for her children's sake, and even <emph>she</emph> grew more cheerful, under the influence of the light and warmth, and the comfortable viands. After the table was cleared, she sat down by the fire, with her children around her. The little ones talked gayly of the future, and the mother, though every pulsation of her heart seemed a wail, forced back her tears, and listened. Warren did nothing; the image of "the angel" lay warm and bright at his heart, but he loved the mother of his infancy too well to speak the words of parting lightly. Dick talked hopefully of the time when he should be old enough to relieve his mother and sisters from dependence on a stranger; of the nice home he would make for them, and the fine horses he would have when he grew to be a man. Emmie's sunny face kindled, and her brown eyes sparkled, as she talked of the new home where they were going. Only the summer before, when Mrs. Hereford had been paid a few shillings more than she expected, for the sewing she had done for a generous lady, she had given the children an omnibus ride into the country; and this was the great gala day of Emmie's life. While Mrs. Hereford had sat under the green trees, holding her little Mabel, and never wearying of making word-pictures for the blind girl; telling her how the sunshine slept among the long grass of the meadows, and how bright were the wings of the summer birds; Emmie had watched, in delighted abstraction, the varied movements of the lambs, ducks, and geese, which peopled the extensive farm the mother had selected for her stopping place.</p>
               <p>The child recalled all this as she sat looking at the embers, and prattled merrily of the flowers, and the lambs, and the poultry she should call her very own, and the tiny little chickens she was to feed with her own hand.</p>
               <p>The sweet Mabel, also, sitting in the mother's arms, raised to the dear face bending over her, her meek, sightless eyes, and whispered—"It will be so<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7298-00000021"/> beautiful there, dear mamma. I can sit under the trees, and I shall know their great arms are waving above me, and the flowers are beneath my feet, and the blue sky over all. You'll have time to talk to me sometimes, won't you, mother dear, and tell me how the sunshine trembles through the leaves, and the hill rises in the distance, and the wind blows the rye into little billows; and, mother, I shall <emph>feel</emph> it blow cool, and fresh, and pure, on my very face, and be so happy I shall never stop to think I cannot see."</p>
               <p>The mother could not speak. She clasped her fatherless ones in her arms, and with her tears falling on Mabel's golden curls, bowed her head in prayer, that though her own heart seemed breaking, the Heavenly Father's hand might lead <emph>them</emph> through the green pastures, and beside the still waters of Peace.</p>

               <head>III. MASTER WARREN GOES TO SCHOOL.</head>
               <p>THE breakfast hour was just over, when the adopted son made his appearance at Mount Vernon street. Juno Clifford had given directions that he should be shown to her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir,</foreign> and there she awaited him with impatient eagerness. He stole timidly through the splendid rooms, scarcely daring to look upon the grandeur of his new home. But when he reached the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir,</foreign> he paused at the door, and seemed unwilling to enter. There was, he thought, so much of graceful, beautiful life around him. The lilies on the velvet carpet seemed to give forth a breath of perfume, and he feared to crush them. The pictures on the wall looked at him with their soft eyes, and he thought they deemed him an intruder. He fairly expected the curved lips of the Grecian statues to call him by his name, they regarded him with such a fixed and earnest gaze. To him they all seemed living things, and into this charmed atmosphere of grace and loveliness he feared to penetrate. For a few moments Juno sat, silently enjoying his surprise,<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7298-00000022"/> Then she said, very gently—"Warren, my child, come hither."</p>
               <p>Until she spoke, he had not perceived her, but now he passed on timidly, and stood beside her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fauteuil,</foreign> at the farther extremity of the room. He was very pale, and there were traces of tears upon his face. She drew him tenderly toward her, and said, in a low tone, reproachful, yet tender, "Was it then so hard to come to me, my poor child?"</p>
               <p>He threw himself on his knees beside her, and pressed her hand to his lips. "Mrs. Clifford!"</p>
               <p>"Nay, Warren, I am your mother now."</p>
               <p>The child choked back his tears, and said, tremblingly, "I am not ungrateful, oh! believe me. I did want to come to you, and all the days of my life I will pray God to bless you, on my bended knees, night and morning, I love you, sweet, beautiful lady; oh, if you will let me, I shall love you so very much; but it was hard to part with <emph>them.</emph> Mother never closed her eyes last night. She held me all that time in her arms, sometimes weeping, and sometimes praying God in heaven to keep her first-born son. And this morning it was so terrible. They cried so. I thought my little sisters' hearts would break. And yet we all knew it was for the best," and the boy paused and stood silently by her side. The future lying so fair before him, the splendor around his path, were alike unheeded in that hour. His heart was with the loves of his childhood—the mother on whose soft breast his head had been of often pillowed—the sisters he had tended in his arms, and the brother that had knelt by his side at the hour of evening prayer. He lived over and over again that fearful parting, and as he felt that he had looked his last in those dear eyes, he bowed his head, and the heavy tears stole down his cheeks, and fell in bright, glittering drops upon the carpet.</p>
               <p>Juno Clifford was thoroughly selfish in her nature, and it vexed her that his heart should so cling to the mother of his infancy. But she saw that he was no common child, and the very difficulty of winning all his love, made her prize it the more. She skilfully dissembled her feelings of mortification, and sitting down upon a lounge, drew him to a seat beside her. Pillowing his head upon her bosom, she murmured—"Weep now, poor child, on your new mother's breast. Let this very sorrow be a tie between us, my own Warren."</p>
               <p>For a long time he lay there silently, while the pent-up grief exhausted itself in tears. It seemed so strange, that the cold, stately, worldly-minded woman should hold him thus. It was a new phase in Juno's character, this intensity of loving, and it astonished no one more than herself. Yet even to Warren her love was purely selfish. She but sought the happiness his unshared affection in return would<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7298-00000023"/> bestow on her. Where she could secure this happiness to herself, and benefit him at the same time, she was contented to do so, but she would sacrifice nothing for his sake. Knowing, as she did, what joy it would give him, to see, or at least to write to his own gentle mother, she would on no account have permitted it, lest <emph>she</emph> should occupy his attention less exclusively. He would dwell upon his grief far less, she reasoned, if he were encouraged to speak of it freely, than if he were forced to guard it as a cherished secret. Besides, was she not, by her very sympathy, already making herself a part of his early recollections; linking herself in his mind with every thing most dear and sacred? Never, in all his after life, when he thought upon that morning of sorrow, could he fail to think of her sweet sympathy. And so she let him weep on.</p>
               <p>An hour had passed thus, when he raised his head from her bosom. She saw, by the smile which broke like sunlight into his clear eyes, that the struggle was over, and she too smiled, as she gently kissed his cheek. "Forgive me, sweetest mother," he said earnestly—I am <emph>not</emph> sorry to come to you. It will be such happiness to live with you always, and here too, where every thing is so beautiful; but it seemed terrible to think that I should never see them all again!"</p>
               <p>"By and by, when you get older, darling, you will understand why Mr. Clifford thought it not right to permit it," she answered in a tone of tender sympathy. It was a part of Juno's selfish policy, in order to secure the child's affections exclusively to herself, that very little of fondness should exist between him and his adopted father. He might respect and fear John Clifford to his heart's content, but he was to <emph>love</emph> only her. Juno did not by any means hate her husband. Indeed, when no one else was present, his compliments and attentions were very welcome. She had lived for the world, and in the strictly exclusive circle in which she moved, she had been surrounded by an atmosphere of admiration and devotion, but neither before her marriage, nor since, had she ever yet <emph>loved.</emph> It is true, during the last few months of her maidenhood, there had been quite a spirited flirtation with a handsome navy officer, but she unceremoniously discarded him when the wealthy Mr. Clifford proposed for her hand. For a time, she preserved a lock of his hair, and a half dozen letters, and seriously attempted to be romantic after the most approved fashion; but she caught a severe cold one evening while looking at the moon, and made a bonfire of the lock of hair and the letters from very vexation. She was habitually indolent, and yet her natural deposition was the most impetuous "in the world. Her character was a strange and contradictory compound of the coldest selfishness and the<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7298-00000024"/> wildest enthusiasm. Her love for Warren was the strongest sentiment she had ever yet experienced. She would scarcely suffer him out of her sight The day after his adoption she countermanded her order for the ball-dress of azure satin, on which she had previously decided and resolved to make her appearance at Mrs. Ashburton's in the costume of the Elizebethan era, for the sole purpose of taking Warren as her companion, in the magnificent attire of a royal page.</p>
               <p>The diamond stomacher and stiff brocade, the ruff and farthingale, seemed singularly suited to the haughty, imperious style of her beauty. She was, as usual, the star of the evening, and her graceful page, announced for the first time as Master Warren Clifford, became all at once quite the fashion. There was in Warren's natural character a great deal of what some persons call vanity—a fondness for the luxuries attendant upon wealth and station, and a haughty family pride, which might have gladdened the hearts of the old race of Hereford. With all his unselfish love, his truth, his reverence, and the many noble elements in his character, he was more easily influenced by his external surroundings, than perhaps one in ten thousand. It was like a scene of enchantment, for him, to move among the flashing lights, and look upon the costly plants, the rare articles of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bijouterie,</foreign> and the splendid women which adorned Mrs. Ashburton's crowded rooms. And among them all his eyes sought, every few moments, for the face of his adopted mother. He felt that she was incomparably the most brilliant woman present; and what to him was rather a feeling than a knowledge, would have been the verdict of every person of artistic taste.</p>
               <p>A painter might perhaps have attempted to explain it. He would have told you that you did not see such eyes once in a century; that they were not only large and lustrous, but perfectly almond-shaped. He would have pointed out the exquisite clearness of her complexion, the delicate arch or her penciled brow, the curve of her coral lip, and the undulating lines of her graceful form. But when he had concluded, you would have felt that he had not at all approached the secret. Warren had a juster notion of her loveliness than any artist in creation. It consisted not in the beauty of her separate features, faultless as they were, but in the exquisite harmony of the whole, and, above all, in the unparalleled grace of her movements, as if every footstep, every wave of her hand, were keeping time to music unheard by other ears.</p>
               <p>She seldom sang; she said it was too much trouble; but this evening she suffered herself to be led to the piano. Her voice was just what Juno Clifford's voice should have been, a clear, full soprano<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7298-00000025"/> prano. When she concluded, the approbation with which she was greeted was fairly rapturous. She turned away with an air of supreme indifference. She was so much accustomed to the homage of the gay circle around her, that it had ceased to charm. As if seeking something truer and fresher, she bent her eyes on Warren. Music was the boy's passion. He stood like one entranced. His hands were clasped, and his long lashes heavy with tears. Juno was satisfied, and moving to his side she pressed his hand in silence.</p>
               <p>That winter, life was very bright to Warren Clifford. A favorite Italian opera troupe were in Boston, and his mania for music was indulged to the fullest extent. He was Mrs. Clifford's constant companion, and he seemed to have transferred to her all the love he once bore to his own mother. The Hereford family were settled in comfortable lodgings just out of town, until their future home in Mohawk village should be left vacant by its tenant. Near at hand as they were, they never heard from Warren, save through an occasional message from Mr. Clifford, saying that he was well and very happy. The boy, on his part, seldom spoke of them. All his thoughts seemed completely absorbed in the beautiful mother of his adoption.</p>
               <p>One day in the early spring John Clifford entered his wife's boudoir, with a pleasant smile. "It is your twenty-fifth birthday, Juno."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I have just discovered Warren's cornea at the same time. Master Warren Clifford is thirteen to-day."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! a double birthday! Just the time for a pleasant surprise, only what I have to say will please you, I fancy, more than it will him. You have so long wanted to visit Europe, that I have been feeling for some time I ought not to defer it any longer. Well, just at the most opportune moment in the world, our firm have come to the conclusion that it is highly important to establish a branch of our house in Paris. Mr. Selwyn is too old to go, and Parks is rather young to be intrusted with an affair of so much moment, so it falls on me. It is just what I desired. There will be no difficulty about introductions, and my wife can see Parisian society in just the phase she most wished. We haven't long to make arrangements, for I must be off in two months."</p>
               <p>"I am very glad we are going," she remarked in the quiet, half-indolent manner which usually characterized her intercourse with her husband. "We shall take Warren, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>'Not unless you wish it very much. We need not be more than a year from home. I can arrange matters so that Parks can take my place by that<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7298-00000026"/> time. There will be so much to occupy your attention that you would have little leisure to devote to him. On the other hand, he is very deficient in many branches of his education, and if we design him for a collegiate career, as you have planned, he absolutely needs to commence his studies immediately."</p>
               <p>Juno considered for a few moments. She could not fail to perceive the justness of her husband's remark, and now that the first flush of her enthusiasm had passed away, she realized that life amid the fascinations of a European court might be very happy without him. It would be far better for him to remain, she saw that plainly, but could she trust him? That was the question on which it all depended. Would his love for her continue as strong as ever? Would his thoughts revert to her, and to the months they had passed together, or would they go longingly back to the mother of his earliest love?</p>
               <p>Juno was, unconsciously to herself, a subtle analyst of character. She understood all Warren's fondness for the luxurious and beautiful. She remembered how thoroughly she was associated with the gratification of his favorite tastes, and that such a mind as his dwelt more lingeringly upon the pleasures than the pains of life, and she decided justly. "He will think most of me," she said to herself, "because I have shared the brightest days with him; besides, I can write to him, and Mrs. Hereford cannot." Then looking up, she quietly remarked—"Well, Mr. Clifford, I have been considering. I think you are right. We will leave Warren. Of course I shall take Jane with me. I shall want her on ship-board, and I could never suit myself anywhere with another dressing-maid."</p>
               <p>"Of course, and since you approve, I will commence looking out a school for Warren immediately. But stay, I had nearly forgotten that I had a present for your birthday." He drew a little azure velvet casket from his pocket, and touching a silver spring revealed a glittering diamond cross attached to a necklace of exquisite workmanship. He clasped it about her neck, and then, as he kissed her brow, bade her look at herself in the mirror opposite.</p>
               <p>Juno had all a Southerner's fondness for elegant jewelry, and her eyes sparkled as she caught the reflection of the brilliants, but she restrained the extreme composure of her manner and merely said,—"Thank you—you were very thoughtful; I like diamonds better than any thing. By the way, Mr. Clifford, as you go down town will you just step into Madame Dudevant's and ask her to hurry with my dress. I want to try it on this afternoon. You know I see company to-night."</p>
               <p>Left to herself, Juno leaned her head against the cushions of the chair, and seemed absorbed in thought.<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7298-00000027"/> It was evident, by the smile which crossed her dainty lip, that her reverie was a pleasant one. She was dreaming of the proud position her husband's wealth and her own beauty would bestow in the gay city whither she was going. She began already to plan the costumes in which she would appear The spoiled child had a new toy, and for the moment Warren was forgotten.</p>
               <p>She had been dreaming a full hour when she heard a quiet, stealing step in the passage, and a low voice said, very gently, "May I come in, mamma?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Warren; yes, darling, come in certainly. Sit here on my lap, Warren."</p>
               <p>"I shall tire you, mamma."</p>
               <p>"No, I will hold you while I can. I have something to tell you. I am going to leave you very soon. In two months I shall start for Europe, and you will go to school." She had not dreamed of the effect this announcement would produce upon the child. He slid from her arms, and kneeling beside her chair buried his face in the folds of her garments, and sobbed convulsively. Juno's heart thrilled with a keen emotion of joy. She had not over-estimated his love for her.</p>
               <p>"Oh I mamma, mamma," he said at length, "it will break my heart, I know it will. I cannot have you go and leave me here!"</p>
               <p>Juno knelt down beside him, and drew him to her bosom. "I must go, darling," she murmured soothingly, "but do not grieve so. Mr. Clifford has decided that you ought to be in school, and he says you cannot possibly go with us. But it is only for a year, my precious boy, we shall not be gone more than that. You shall write to me by every vessel, and the time will pass sooner than you think. Don't make it harder for me, by this wild grief of yours. See, I too am weeping. Can you not do something to make me happy? Promise me that you will think of me every day while I am gone, and try, for my sake, very earnestly to improve. Let me see how much you can accomplish. I want to be <emph>proud</emph> of you, Warren!" The words sunk into the boy's heart; he never forgot them even for a moment. It became as a life purpose to him to become what that beautiful mother could be proud of.</p>
               <p>During the next two months, Warren's pale, sorrowful face was a perpetual joy to Juno. She felt that he had never grieved half so deeply at the parting with his own mother, and she was satisfied that her ascendency over his affections would be maintained during her absence. He listened to the arrangements for his residence at Glenthorne Academy with a kind of sorrowful resignation. He would stand for hours together at Mrs. Clifford's side, watching every Expression that flitted over her face, and then he would say, looking at her with a strange<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7298-00000028"/> earnestness in his tearful eyes, "You are so beautiful, my mother," and turn aside to weep.</p>
               <p>At last the preparations for the voyage were completed. They were to embark from New York, and on their way thither, by the over-land route, they were to leave Master Warren at the school they had selected. The residence at Mount Vernon street was left in charge of a faithful and competent housekeeper, and the travelers bade it farewell in a frame of mind somewhat less joyous than Juno's anticipations of two months before.</p>
               <p>At night-fall the carriage drew up before Glenthorne Academy. It was a preparation-school, principally attended by those students designing to become members of Yale. The building was a stately edifice, of dark gray stone. The grounds surrounding it seemed very pleasant. There was a kind of park, with tall trees scattered here and there, and a little brook, just then swollen by the spring rains, dashing musically along among the shrubbery.</p>
               <p>A spacious apartment had been assigned to the heir of the wealthy Mr. Clifford, and when the party entered it, the last beams of the setting sun were just lighting up the neighboring tree-tops. They walked to the window. The view was beautiful. The freshness of spring-time lay all over the green landscape. To the travellers, just emerged from the dust and din of the crowded city, it seemed like a Paradise In the distance they could see two or three cows walking slowly homeward, along a winding road, and nearer still, a flock of sheep had laid down upon a side-hill, with their lambs around them. They threw open the lattice, and the room was flooded with the fragrance of the lilacs and laburnums. The internal arrangement was almost equally pleasant. Between the lofty windows stood a table with a well furnished writing desk. In one corner was a quaintly carved book-case, and in another a capacious wardrobe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifford had become really fond of the boy, and when he had completed his survey of the apartment, he turned to him and said, pleasantly, "I am very glad we came this way. I shall be quite satisfied about you now. Every thing will be pleasant around you, and I have the utmost confidence in your instructors. You have a great deal to accomplish before your education can at all compare with other boys of your own age, and I am sure, for your mother's sake and mine, you will try earnestly to improve."</p>
               <p>"Of course he will," said Juno, carelessly. "Come, Warren, Jane will unpack your trunks. I want you to sit down and talk with me this last night!"</p>
               <p>When the carriage rolled away from Glenthorne, the next morning, it was as if half Warren Clifford's life went with it. Juno had clasped him in her arms, and covered him with tears and kisses, murmuring<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7298-00000029"/> words of endearment as tender as ever fell from a mother's lips. Mr. Clifford had held his hand and invoked Heaven's blessing on him, as if he were indeed his son, and now they were both gone. Every turn of the wheels was bearing them farther from him.</p>
               <p>He passed hurriedly into his own room. At the foot of the bed hung a full length portrait of his adopted mother. It was her parting gift. He threw himself down before it and wept.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>IV. CLIFFORD HALL.</head>
               <p>MONTH after month rolled away, until three years had passed since Warren Clifford's parting with his adopted mother. She had fully intended to return in a year, when she left home, but the fascinations of continental society proved too strong for her resolution. Mr. Clifford was as obedient as ever to her caprices, and expressed no wish to revisit his native country. Her letters to Warren, though not very frequent, were always kind and tender, but she made mention of no intention to return. Her triumphant anticipations of a sojourn in Paris were more than realized. The beautiful American, as she was usually called, had become a star of the first magnitude, even among the titled belles of the court. Her sayings were quoted, her dress and manners copied, and her path surrounded with flatterers. And yet Juno Clifford had not learned the passionate lesson of love. The most brilliant men in the realm had bowed at her shrine, but she received their homage with the<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7298-00000030"/> cool pride of an empress. It was not that she had strength of principle to guide her, for she was constantly swayed by impulse, and her highest object in life was her own happiness. But she had not yet seen one who had power to quicken the play of her languid pulses, and so she added to her reputation for grace and beauty the distinction always awarded to a correct life, and nowhere more prized than in the midst of the voluptuous and dissolute.</p>
               <p>She sat in her dressing-room one evening absorbed in thought. Her restless spirit had become weary of the life she led. There were no new acquaintances to be made, no fresh hearts to be won. She was tired of the homage, for which no effort was necessary, and with the holy hush of the evening there came to her a memory of the earnest-hearted boy she had left behind her; of his worship of her beauty, and his unselfish and grateful love. She had very seldom thought of him of late, absorbed as she had been, and in a continual whirl of fashionable dissipation. His letters had been read with a merely passing interest, and she had written him an occasional note, with scarcely an effort to soothe the disappointment her heart told her this long-continued separation must have occasioned.</p>
               <p>But this night her thoughts went back to him very tenderly. She pleased herself by fancying how much he would be grown and improved; how tall he would be, and how graceful, for he gave rare promise of grace, even in his early, suffering boyhood. That he loved her as fondly as ever, she well knew. Every American mail brought her a letter, in his well-known hand, full of the most earnest and tender expressions of affection. She recollected now, with a feeling of self-reproach, that, absorbed in her preparations for a brilliant assembly, she had scarcely read his last letter. She rose, and sought for it among the varied contents of her ebony writing-desk. Then she drew a silver lamp toward her, and throwing herself back in her chair, commenced its perusal. The chirography had become at once manly and elegant, but the style was simple, and natural as ever. Toward the close it said—</p>
               <p>"Every day, sweetest mother, I pass many hours looking at your farewell gift. Sometimes my heart gets very heavy with this long parting, I see other sons turn joyfully to seek loving mothers and happy homes, and I crush back the tears I am too proud to weep, as I think that, for three lonely years, home and mother have been to me but a name. Then I walk wearily into the pleasant room your parting cares made so beautiful, and look upon your picture, until the dream of a mother's love becomes a warm and bright reality, and I almost expect the beautiful face to bend smiling down from the canvas, and the bright<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7298-00000031"/> lips to drop a kiss upon my brow. Are you coming some time, mother?"</p>
               <p>The lady paused, still holding the letter in her fingers with a kind of caressing clasp. A warm, bright smile broke over her sparkling features, and kindled her eyes. Her lips parted, and a murmured "Bear child" escaped them. "He is really eloquent," she ejaculated after another silence; "not one of all the flatterers surrounding me could have written half so beautifully, for the unmistakable impress of <emph>truth</emph> would have been wanting in their fine sentences. The boy really thinks I'm an angel!"</p>
               <p>Verily, that child's love was working wonders when Juno Clifford talked of truth—she whose whole life was but an embodiment of beautiful acting. "I want to see him," she mused on," and why can't I?" I have had enough of this humdrum life in Paris. I am tired of it. Yes; I <emph>will</emph> see him." Tinkle, tinkle, rung out her little silver bell, and her quadroon waiting-maid entered. "Jane," she said in the old, habitual tone of impatient authority," send Mr. Clifford to me; I want him <emph>now.</emph>"</p>
               <p>In a moment more John Clifford entered. He was a noble-looking man, or perhaps I should describe him more correctly if I said a <emph>good</emph>-looking man. His face was emphatically good. His calm, English features wore the ruddy hue of hale and hearty manhood. His form was square and stout, indicating a high degree of muscular energy, combined with great strength. His once soft brown hair was fast becoming gray, and there were lines about his mouth which suggested the idea of worthy, and yet firm resolve. He was a very quiet man in most things. You would never have suspected him of being Juno Clifford's lover-husband, had you met him outside of her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir,</foreign> and still less of cherishing in secret an ideal love, whose presence he summoned to his side, to teach him patience with the gay frivolity around him. His fiftieth birth-day was near at hand, but he looked at least sixty. Already he seemed a hale old man, "frosty, but kindly." He was very cheerful, however, in spite of the haunting consciousness that something was wanting to him, which should have made his life far better, and more beautiful. More than ever was he proud of Juno. Her peerless loveliness and regal pride made her, wherever they went, the cynosure of surrounding eyes; and more and more he felt that he owed her the devotion of an eternity for consenting to gift him with all this dower of grace and beauty. There was a kind of proud humility in his manner, as he entered the dressing-room, and stood beside her chair.</p>
               <p>"Please to sit down," she said, in a slightly imperious tone. He obeyed her instantly. She folded the open letter in her hand, and then looking earnestly<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7298-00000032"/> nestly at him, she inquired, "Mr. Clifford, do you never want to see Warren?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, I would like to see him. I often think we have hardly done the poor child justice. We call him by our own name, but we have never legally adopted him. We took him from his home, and his mother, and in six months left him, as lonely and solitary as if he had not a friend in the world. It is not quite right, certainly."</p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Clifford, and I am heartily tired of this place. Isn't your business such, now, that Parks could take charge of it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, certainly, very easily."</p>
               <p>"Well, have you still in your possession those lovely grounds you purchased for a country seat, just before we left home?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have them still."</p>
               <p>"There is no house on them, of course?"</p>
               <p>"No; our return seemed postponed for such an indefinite period, I was undecided what to do with the place."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Clifford, I want to live there next summer. You remember La Comtesse M——'s beautiful villa we both admired so much? Well, La Comtesse told me the architect and landscape gardener who planned it are both out of employment. I want you should send them over by the next vessel, and have our place as nearly modelled after the villa as possible. They can finish it by next spring; a whole year. This summer we will visit England and Germany, and this winter reside in Italy, and go home in the spring. Does my plan suit you?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly, as all your plans do, provided <emph>you</emph> are satisfied. I will send the men over, and write to Parks by the same vessel."</p>
               <p>And so the architect and the gardener were sent over, and with them a letter to Master Warren, couched in Juno's most gentle and loving phrases. She had persuaded Mr. Clifford to return, solely for his sake, she wrote. She felt that it had been cruel to leave him to his loneliness so long, but she was coming. Soon as their summer residence was ready for their reception, she should be with him.</p>
               <p>The boy's heart thrilled with pleasurable anticipation as he read it. In that hour he had no thought for the mother who had cradled him on her breast. During all these years, he had not once heard from her, and her memory, though not dead utterly, slept on, low down in his soul, a slumber too profound for dreams.</p>
               <p>And, one stone after another, Clifford Hall was built up. The minutest directions were forwarded from time to time, for the furnishing of every apartment; and standing in the winter moonlight, within her Italian villa, looking from her window over the sluggish waters of the Po, Juno Clifford clasped her<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7298-00000033"/> hands, and speculated idly about that future, which was so near, she could not see a single thing.</p>
               <p>It was a bright May morning, on which the Clifford family took possession of their new residence They had reached Boston the night before, and they drove out to their country-seat in their own carriage. The architect and the gardener had made the most of their materials. The carriage-drive wound through an avenue of spacious horse, chestnuts, already odorous with bloom. Looking out, between their trunks, you could catch glimpses of playing fountains, and sparkling streams; of green sunny banks, and thickets of rose-trees, and of a summer-house built with the classic elegance of a Grecian temple. A sudden turn brought you for the first time in sight of the mansion. It was built of pure, white stone, and the style of the architecture was peculiarly light and graceful. It was surmounted by a lofty observatory, and at the western end was a miniature chapel, with its stained glass windows, and cumbrous columns, forming a pleasant contrast with the main building.</p>
               <p>Scarcely deigning a look at all this loveliness around her, Juno Clifford swept into the house. An obsequious footman threw open the door of her boudoir, and she walked proudly in. "Has Master Warren Clifford arrived?" was her first question.</p>
               <p>"No, madam, he cannot possibly get here before evening. We did not hear of your arrival in time for the news to reach him until last night."</p>
               <p>"Very well. Jane, you can take away my things. I shall lie down for a half-hour, and then I will go over the house. In the mean time you can ask Mr. Clifford to unpack those pictures. I cannot trust the servants to handle them, and I want to see them hung this morning."</p>
               <p>All that day after her brief rest in the morning, our idle Lady Juno was actually busy. They had brought with them many costly gems of Italian art, and she herself superintended their disposition about her elegant rooms. Pictures were hung upon the walls; rare, old masterpieces, worth thrice their weight in gold. Out in the pleasure-grounds, graceful statues were placed like sylvan deities beneath the leafy trees. Water nymphs bent over the fountains, as if they had paused in the very act of combing out their long tresses, to listen to some dim, sweet melody of the waves. A marble Flora stood among the beds of variegated flowers with her graceful urn. Little gems of European art were scattered all over the interior of the mansion. Silver lamps, with garlands of raised flowers; curious book-stands, and tiny tables, in-wrought with many an arabesque device, and a thousand other little womanly trifles, at once betokened refined taste, and most lavish expenditure.</p>
               <p>Just under an old oak tree, that looked as if it<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7298-00000034"/> had withstood the blast of centuries with the bold defiance of its green arms, had been dug a rustic well. Already the stones were covered with moss, and the plume-like ferns drooped over its margin. Even here the lady left an index of her presence, and hung just beside the oaken bucket, a golden drinking-cup fretted with silver.</p>
               <p>It was mid afternoon before her arrangements were all completed, and she entered her dressing-room. For once, she was quite satisfied; her expectations had been surpassed. She threw herself down in a chair by the window, and gazed out over the pleasure-grounds, with a smile of triumph curling her lips.</p>
               <p>"What will madam please to wear?" said the soft tones of the quadroon, recalling her from her reverie. They were waiting dinner for Warren, and she was governed by a thought of him in the decision.</p>
               <p>"Dress me in simple white muslin, Jane. I don't want to frighten the poor child away from me by Parisian splendors to which he is not accustomed."</p>
               <p>She had chosen well, as she acknowledged to herself, standing before the mirror, when the business of the toilet was completed. No other costume could have suited so admirably the gentle, mother-like character it was her purpose to assume. It seemed even to enchance her beauty. Her dimpled arms were bare from the shoulder, save a deep frill of Mechlin lace. Her hair was braided with classic sim plicity, and wreathed about her head like a coronal, and among its heavy folds lay a wreath of half-opened water-lilies. She looked more beautiful, fresher, younger even, than she had done for many years before. She left her dressing-room, and joined her husband on the terrace. He turned as she put her hand through his arm, and whispered, with lover-like gallantry—"Fairer than ever, Juno <foreign xml:lang="LAT">regina</foreign>."</p>
               <p>It was only a half-hour before a carriage turned up the drive, and stopped before the door. A young gentleman alighted; a stranger, they thought, at the first glance. He was taller than Juno, taller than even Mr. Clifford; and yet he seized John Clifford's hand, and called him father. Could that be Warren? It must be, for he springs to her side, he clasps her fervently in his arms, and whispers, with his lips against her cheek—"My mother, my own sweet, beautiful mother!"</p>
               <p>"Bless me, Warren; why, how you have grown!" she exclaimed, at length, extricating herself from his embrace—"Stand off there, and let me look at you!"</p>
               <p>He had indeed grown very handsome. His figure was tall, but graceful; his forehead was fair, open, and white as an infant's. On it clustered heavy brown curls, and his clear blue eyes looked out from beneath, with all the innocent earnestness peculiar to their expression in early childhood. His features were purely Grecian, and round his mouth was a look<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7298-00000035"/> of tempered firmness, which redeemed its beauty from the charge of feminine softness. Juno was entranced; she had thought of him as a child; grown indeed, but still small enough to sit at her feet, and bear any amount of petting. She found him a young gentleman, whom her heart acknowledged as the handsomest person she had ever yet met; whose low, musical tone thrilled her with a vague, indefinable transport; whose caresess called the blushes to her olive cheek, as her husband's had never done; and yet she said to herself, approvingly, "Surely it is well to love him, I am his mother!" He was but seventeen years old, and yet so fully developed in mind and person, that he would usually have been taken for at least twenty-one. He had faithfully improved the advantages afforded him, and there was a quiet ease in his manner, and a refined eloquence in his conversation, with which Juno was momently more and more enchanted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifford retired early, as was his habit on all occasions, and for half the night Juno retained by her side the child of her adoption. They went out together, and wandered to and fro among the shrubbery, where the moonbeams rained light and glory upon their path, and Juno talked of the yet brighter moonlight that flooded the glorious ruins of Italy. She told him stories of many a land—the castled Rhine, the blue lakes of Switzerland, and the French girls singing beneath their vines; and somehow, by some im perceptible channel, the conversation always wandered back to the lonely hours she had passed without him, and the sweet memories of the childish love he had given her. She said those memories had lain warm and bright at her heart, during all the months and years of absence, and Warren listened and loved, and thanked God that this gifted and beautiful being had been given him for a mother. The love he had cherished so many months in loneliness and solitude, seemed springing into a wilder, and quicker life—it was becoming akin to worship, and yet it was pure as Heaven. It was such as a child might have felt, in those blessed days of the earth's infancy, when angels did not disdain to walk with mortals, for some sunbright seraph, who sang him to sleep in a long, blue day of summer,—so pure it was, and so beautiful; and ever its key-note was that blessed word <emph>mother,</emph> which the immaculate Son of God has not disdained to hallow with the utterance of his divinity.</p>
               <p>They walked in, out of the moonlight, and sat down once more in the magnificent <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir.</foreign> Juno's arm was around him whom she called her son. She drew him to her bosom, with all the mother-like tenderness of her earlier love; and then, with her heart beating against his side as it had never beat before, she bent smiling over him, twining in her fingers the soft length of his brown curls, and listening to the thrice-told story of his love and his loneliness.</p>

               <head>V. GRACE.</head>
               <p>IT had been arranged that Warren should remain for a twelvemonth longer at Glenthorne, that he might enter Yale in the Sophomore year; and after a three weeks' vacation he left Clifford Hall, and once more repaired to the seminary. His friend, Malcom Hastings, had been a frequent subject of conversation between himself and his mother, and he had no sooner reached Glenthorne, than he turned his steps towards that gentleman's boarding place. Mr. Hastings was a calm, dignified man of thirty, looking, perhaps, ten years older than that. He had been, for two years, the principal of the young ladies' seminary in Glenthorne, and for many months Warren had been his most constant companion. The formation of so close a friendship between persons differing so widely in age and character, had been as much a mystery to themselves as to the good people of Glenthorne. It arose in part from Warren's passion for the beautiful. He had seen at a friend's rooms, a few choice sketches of scenes in the vicinity, which were attributed to the school-teacher; and thus impelled, had sought his acquaintance with all the natural ardor of his disposition. There was something in the frank cheerfulness of the handsome, impetuous boy, that was singularly attractive to the reserved and dignified Mr. Hastings, and Warren was forthwith admitted to an intimacy to which no one else had dared even to aspire.</p>
               <p>His welcome of the young student was cordial as a brother's, and he listened with unaffected sympathy to Warren's eager description of his beautiful home, and his raptures over his fascinating mother. "And what of Glenthorne?" asked the boy, carelessly, as he concluded his recital. Something very like a blush crossed Malcom Hastings' calm, open countenance, as he answered, in a tone of attempted indifference:—</p>
               <p>"Nothing very particular. You know, Warren, that beautiful cottage by the lake, which for the past six months has stood empty? Well, who do think took possession of it, the very day you you left? No other than a family of my dearest friends—Mr. Russel Atherton with his wife, and his daughter Grace. I was for a long time an inmate of their home, and I have held Grace in my arms many an hour. But I haven't seen them since she was eight years old, and she is fifteen now; a sweeter girl than even my fancy ever painted her."</p>
               <p>"Can I see her? You <emph>will</emph> introduce me, won't<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7298-00000037"/> you?" coaxingly asked Warren, interested in spite of himself. A keen observer would have detected Mr. Hastings' secret in a moment. Juno Clifford, had she been there, with her intuitive knowledge of character, would not have failed to discover instantly that Malcom Hastings loved the Grace of his narrative, with all the intense, passionate devotion which a man of thirty bestows, when he loves for the first time. But Warren suspected nothing of the kind. It was full a minute before Mr. Hastings made answer. He turned his dark, serious eyes full upon Warren's face. The boy was beautiful. As Juno Clifford once said, he was the very impersonation of a summer morning. Would not such beauty, such youth, such <emph>sunniness,</emph> so to speak, of the whole character, be quick to charm Grace Atherton's poet heart? And if it would, he asked himself, what right had <emph>he</emph> to separate them. Let them love, if Fate so willed, he would be happy in her joy. "Yes, Warren," he said, with the tone of one who had conquered himself, "yes, you shall see Grace. I will take you there to-morrow evening. She is very lovely."</p>
               <p>"And gifted?" Warren inquired. "My mother is so gloriously gifted, she has spoiled me, henceforth and for ever, for all silly, missish individuals, be they ever so pretty."</p>
               <p>There was a kind of timid pride in Malcom Hastings' manner, as he drew from his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">escritoire</foreign> a package of young ladies' compositions. Turning them over, he took one from their number, and handed it to Warren. "Read that," he said, "and then answer your own question."</p>
               <p>The manuscript was distinguished by a singular neatness and purity. The sheet was small, and spotlessly white, and the penmanship light as the tracery of a fairy. "Read it out loud, Warren;" and the school-teacher settled himself back in his chair, with an air of prospective enjoyment.</p>
               <p>"Here goes," cried Warren, gayly, as he commenced to read—</p>

               <p>"Why, Mr. Hastings, the girl is a real poet," remarked the reader, very gravely, as he concluded—" a genuine poet, do you hear? There is an exquisite simplicity in those lines, that is really wonderful for such a child."</p>
               <p>"The child is only two years younger than yourself, laughed Malcom Hastings. "How is it, Ware; have you come to the conclusion that she is gifted enough to be worth a call?"</p>
               <p>"I should rather think I had. Come now, there's a good fellow, let us go to-night. I'm not one bit tired."</p>
               <p>"No!"</p>
               <p>"What! you won't? When shall I see her, then?"</p>
               <p>"Not one moment before half-past six o'clock, to morrow evening; so hold your peace. Your face most certainly belies your assertion that you are not tired, and you must go over to the academy, and take possession of your bedroom, instanter."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! I don't want to!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I want you should, and that's more to the purpose. Here you've been hindering me a full hour, and I have all these compositions to correct before morning. Heaven knows they are hopeless-looking subjects enough some of them."</p>
               <p>"Well, if I must, I must; but I want a bribe. Give me that composition of Grace Atherton's, and I'll take myself off."</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, Miss Atherton's composition, will be restored to the original owner, according to the rules of the learned institution over which I have the honor to preside. Good night, Warren."</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7298-00000039"/>
               <p>"Good night, since you are determined on turning me out of doors."</p>
               <p>The next evening the call was made. Glenthorne Cottage, as Mr. Atherton's residence had been christened by the villagers, was, indeed, a fair and lovely spot. The somewhat fanciful architecture of the little cottage <foreign xml:lang="FRA">orneé</foreign> suited well the beautiful scenery lying around it. Nothing could have formed a more striking contrast, than Clifford Hall, with its lofty turrets and magnificent grounds, presented to this rural home, so beautiful in its simplicity; unless, indeed, it were Juno Clifford, and sweet Grace Atherton. The yard in the rear of the cottage was bright with spring-time flowers, and it sloped gently down to the green shore of a tiny lakelet, whose clear blue waters were the pride and glory of Glenthorne. The little white cottage was itself hidden by a wilderness of shrubbery. Over the rustic porch, in the right wing of the building, twined lovingly the climbing rose and trumpet creeper; while over the left-hand wing, the deep green of the woodbine formed a beautiful contrast! with the white-veined ivy. In the whole arrangements, within as well as without, the most studied simplicity had been preserved. The chair in the porch was of forest boughs, still green with moss, fantastically twisted together. The choice engravings which adorned the walls, were framed with moss-grown twigs, and the chairs and sofas were of home manufacture, simply covered with a delicate green chintz. Every thing was in perfect keeping, and betokened the most refined and cultivated taste. As they approached the house, they had a full view of Grace, before she was at all conscious of their presence; and that view Warren bore away with him and treasured in his heart, for many a changing year. He never thought of her, that it was not present to his mind, distinct and lifelike, as a portrait by a master hand.</p>
               <p>She stood in the western porch, watching the clouds. Her hair, of a pale gold-color, was kindled into flashes of brilliancy, by the last rays 'of the setting sun. It fell in a shower of rippling waves about her graceful neck and shoulders, and contrasted beautifully with a skin fair as an infant's. Her eyes were a clear, deep blue, and at that moment full of an unconscious inspiration. Her face was turned towards the sunset, and they saw it in profile. Her features were small, and exquisitely delicate. The faintest tinge of rose brightened the soft cheek, and the red lips were just parted, revealing a glimpse of little teeth, white and even as the break in a fresh cocoa-nut. Her figure was almost ethereal in its lightness, and was thrown into full relief by the pillar, covered with woodbine, against which she leaned. Her dress was of simple white muslin, confined around the slender waist by a silken cord. Over her head<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7298-00000040"/> drooped the clinging tendrils of the ivy-vine, lovingly, as if Nature, herself, were crowning her daughter. There was an atmosphere of purity about that young girl, into which sin would have feared to penetrate. "Is she not beautiful?" whispered Warren under his breath.</p>
               <p>"She is something higher and better than that," was the low reply; and then for a few moments the two remained, silently watching that slight girl, standing there as if entranced, her fair forehead bathed with the sunset glory.</p>
               <p>"Grace!" said the teacher, at length, speaking aloud. The girl turned toward him, with a smile of welcome. When she saw a stranger beside him, her cheek crimsoned with blushes; but she came forward with quiet, graceful self-possession, and extended her hand.</p>
               <p>During the next month, Warren was a frequent visitor at Glenthorne Cottage. For a time Malcom Hastings was his companion, but when he saw that Warren's voice had power to call a light to those blue eyes his tones had never wakened, he gradually absented himself. To Grace he continued the same kind and faithful instructor, and his manner to Warren was friendly and brother-like as ever; yet every one in Glenthorne noticed the additional shade of sadness that darkened his mild, serious eyes; and some who loved him, remarked that the smiles which used to light up his face, though they were sweet as ever, came at far longer intervals.</p>
               <p>But neither Warren Clifford nor the gentle Grace had over yet thought of love. Sufficient for them was the happiness of the day and the hour, without casting a single glance onward into the future. They wandered together along the margins of the pleasant streams, and through the green paths of the woodland, talking, with the sweet faith of innocent youth, of every thing beautiful in art and nature. And this led Warren on to speak of his early childhood, his adoption, and the glorious being who was still, as then, his eidolon of beauty. Grace listened with a smile to the warm praises he lavished on his adopted mother, and then lifting her blue eyes, she said, gently, "and your own mother, Warren, what of her?"</p>
               <p>A painful blush crimsoned his face, as if he had been convicted of some crime, as he answered—" She was the tenderest of mothers, Gracie, and I loved her dearly, but she gave me up of her own accord, and bade me forget her. She said it would be better for my happiness, and my new mother's, both!</p>
               <p>"And you obeyed her, Warren?" This time there was a reproachful accent in the young girl's questioning tones.</p>
               <p>"No, Gracie! not quite that." He hesitated—"No, I did not forget her at all, but I tried to think of her as seldom as possible; I thought it was for the best."</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7298-00000041"/>
               <p>"Warren, please let us go home."</p>
               <p>"Go home! Gracie, you are angry with me. Don't, oh, Gracie, don't look at me with such cold, reproachful eyes. I meant to do right. My mother had three other children to love her, and Mrs. Clifford has only me. She loves me so, more than my own mother ever did. Oh, Grace, if you knew her, you wouldn't wonder or be angry."</p>
               <p>"I don't wonder, and I haven't been angry. I don't know as I am even quite sure you have done wrong; I wanted to go home because I was tired. If I looked at you strangely, it was only that a question puzzled me. I was thinking whether if your new mother hadn't been rich or beautiful, you would have loved her so much?"</p>
               <p>"I think not, Gracie, if she hadn't been beautiful, but if she were to be ever so poor, that wouldn't make any difference. I would work for her."</p>
               <p>One day soon after this conversation, he persuaded Grace to come to his room, with two of her schoolmates, and look at the full-length portrait of Juno Clifford. She was entranced, and after that she expressed no more astonishment at the love her friend bore to his adopted mother. One evening,—it was the last week in June,—Warren was sitting in the porch of Glenthorne Cottage. He had brought over a volume of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and had been reading aloud that magnificent poem—"Lady Geraldine's Courtship." There was silence for a few moments when he concluded, and then Grace said, musingly—"I wonder if you would have done that, Warren?"</p>
               <p>"Done what, Gracie?"</p>
               <p>"What Geraldine did? I wonder, if you had been her, whether you would have given up wealth and station, and rejected the earl for a love-match with the poet?"</p>
               <p>"How can you ask, Grace? What true man or woman would hesitate for a moment? If I loved, I should give up every thing."</p>
               <p>"Do not be positive, Warren. Time will prove this, it may be. There may come a time when you will think of this very conversation. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Well, Grace, we shall see, or, more likely, we shall not see, for I can scarcely conceive of ever having any such choice to make."</p>
               <p>"Yes, we shall see," answered the young girl, dreamingly. "Warren, tell me some more about Dick and Emmie, and the little blind Mabel!"</p>
               <p>"I told you all I know, long ago, Gracie. Somehow I have thought of them more since I knew you, than for three years back. I seem to see Emmie's sunny face, as it used to smile on me when I went home to that tottering old house, worn out and discouraged<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7298-00000042"/> couraged. I do believe that child had a real Christian spirit. She was so cheerful and contented in that comfortless place. She would take off her own clothes to wrap around poor sightless Mabel, and then sing gayly as a lark, so that no one might think she was cold, or suffering."</p>
               <p>"And Mabel," suggested Grace, her eyes dim with tears, "I think you told me she was pretty, did you not?"</p>
               <p>"Not pretty, at least, that is not quite the word She had the most spiritual face I ever looked upon. She seemed made perfect through suffering, mere babe as she was. She was so poetical, too. <emph>You</emph> should have seen her; you two would have loved each other."</p>
               <p>"Warren,"—the girl's voice was tremulous with emotion,—"you have called me your sister, sometimes. Will you promise me to think of me always, when you do of Emmie and Mabel? I shall like to remember this promise when you are far away. I don't quite want you to think of me, when you think of Mrs. Clifford. She is so grand, and stately, and beautiful, that she takes away my breath. But just remember me whenever those gentle sisters seem to stand beside you, and then I shall think there's a little corner of your heart, where it says Grace, where my name fits in just right. <emph>Will</emph> you promise, Warren?"</p>
               <p>"Why yes, Gracie, I'll promise, if you wish it, but you are strangly sad to-night. I see you so often, such a promise seems needless."</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless I wanted it, and now you've given it, I'm not sad any longer;" and in proof of her assertion, she turned toward him a face so bright and beaming with smiles, that he was half tempted to press a brother's kiss upon the upturned brow. But he refrained, he scarcely knew why himself. There was, spite of her childishness, a great deal of calm, womanly dignity and reserve about the simple cottage girl.</p>
               <p>"Here you are, Clifford," exclaimed a classmate's voice, half an hour later, interrupting Warren and Grace in a very philosophical discussion about the Language of Flowers. Here's a letter the express-man left for you, and I thought I would run over with it. He said it was of immediate importance."</p>
               <p>Warren perceived by the post-mark that it was from home, and he hurriedly broke the seal. He recognized, as he did so, the flowing, characteristically graceful chirography of his mother's quadroon maid. Juno had caused the girl to be carefully instructed in penmanship, and was accustomed to make use of her services as amanuensis, whenever she felt indisposed for the exertion of writing herself. Consequently, this circumstance occasioned no surprise; but he changed color rapidly as he read. "Just read that, Gracie," he exclaimed, handing it to his companion, as he finished its perusal. You will see my mother is<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7298-00000043"/> very ill. Good Heavens! Grace, if she dies, I must die too. I shall get a fast horse, and go to the next town to-night, that I may take the morning stage. There is no time to lose. Good-bye, little Grace; be a good child, and think of me as often as you can get time."</p>
               <p>In his hurry and confusion he did not notice that the hand he clasped in his own was cold as marble, or that a deathly pallor stole over Grace Atherton's face. He did not heed the earnest prayer in her timid eyes, but with a hurried farewell, rushed to his room.</p>
               <p>In half an hour he had arranged the things he was to leave behind, packed his portmanteau, bidden Malcom Hastings an affectionate adieu, and started for the stage-station of the neighboring town.</p>

               <head>VI. PLOTTING AND POETRY.</head>
               <p>IT was late in the afternoon of the next day. Juno Clifford turned wearily on her couch. Her very accommodating physician called her disease a low, nervous fever, but if he had said a severe attack of ennui, he would have been quite as near the truth. "What time is it, Jane?" Her tone was slightly fretful, but her face brightened as the quadroon answered—"Near five o'clock, my lady."</p>
               <p>"Almost time," she ejaculated more cheerfully.</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam, Mr. Clifford usually comes at five."</p>
               <p>"Does he?" Juno's tone was very impatient. "I wasn't thinking of that; but Warren Clifford, my son, will be here when the stage comes in—at half-past five, is it not?"</p>
               <p>A queer smile crossed the quadroon's face, as her mistress uttered so complacently those two words, "my son," but it vanished instantly; and she answered with respectful gravity—"Yes, ma'am, at half-past five, I believe. Would you like to get up?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I suppose I had better. I must be dressed<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7298-00000044"/> by and by. Just draw that large easy-chair in front of the cheval mirror, and then see if you can help me to cross the room." The girl obeyed, and Mrs. Clifford arose, and with little apparent difficulty walked to her chair. She looked in the mirror for a moment, and then exclaimed—"Goodness, Jane, how frightfully faded I look! I wanted to be pale, but one would think I had been sick a month. Is there any of that rouge left, I used in Paris?"</p>
               <p>"A little; will madam like it now?"</p>
               <p>"No, there is no hurry. It is just time for Mr. Clifford to come. I'll dress afterwards."</p>
               <p>At that moment John Clifford's step sounded upon the stair. He always seemed happier when Juno was a little ill. Not that he didn't prize her health and beauty; but then, if she wasn't well enough to go into society, there seemed less of conventional restraint, and more of real heart sympathy between them. Few men ever married with higher hopes than John Clifford. His fair bride was only seventeen, and beautiful as our childhood's visions of angels. He was twenty years older, and had enough of wealth to give her a position worthy of her loveliness. He adored her passionately, and to him her character seemed as nearly perfection as her face. He expected that she would go in society, and be admired; he looked for some womanly vanity,—that would be but natural, with so much grace and beauty; but he believed lieved her too truly proud to have married him for a position merely. He expected her to <emph>love</emph> him. During the gayeties of their honey-moon time, he contented himself with seeing her the cynosure of every eye, and remembering that she was his own. He looked forward to a quieter season, when that bright head would rest upon his breast, when those warm arms would clasp his neck, and he should hear that music-laden voice murmur love-words in his ear. But months were braided into years, and this time never came. After a while, he tried to think his fancies had been extravagant. He smiled, as he looked into Juno's full-length mirror, and said, with affected carelessness—"You are not a handsome man, John Clifford. Why should <emph>you</emph> expect any such unreasonable goings-on." But laugh at himself as he would, the old, aching void was still there. He thought she must love him a little, and he treasured up every look and tone, that his hopeful fancy could torture into evidence. She was true to him, he <emph>knew</emph> that; and he prided himself on her purity; but the dreams that were so bright and sunny at first, passed away, and left his heart in darkness, as sunset clouds ever so golden and crimson, fade suddenly into the night. And yet, he loved her just as fondly as if it had been otherwise; perhaps even more so; but it was rather the worship and homage of the lover, than the sanctified tenderness of the husband. Her caresses came at such long intervals, that<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7298-00000045"/> her lightest touch had power to thrill him like a subtle infusion of electricity. But as years passed on, he realized that this was all, and he grew in one sense contented, and now his dreamings were not of what <emph>she</emph> would be to him some day, but rather of an imaginary wife, who yet never seemed, in his mind, wholly distinct from Juno. She was loving, gentle, tender, and very sweet in her simplicity. Just what Juno might have been, he fancied, had he been more worthy of her love, and she less beautiful. But there was, as I said, less of restraint between them, when she was ill, and her fashionable friends were not around her.</p>
               <p>He paused for a moment in the upper hall, and then came quietly in. "How is my sweet wife this afternoon?" he said, in his deep, loving tones.</p>
               <p>She raised her eyes languidly. "I am not very strong. I have wished to dress all the afternoon, but I haven't been able, and now that I feel a little better, Jane is going to help me."</p>
               <p>He understood from her words and her manner that she wished him to leave her, but he threw himself down before her chair, and clasped his arm around her waist. "Juno," he said, in a voice tremulous with emotion, "I have been thinking what a terrible thing life would be, if I should lose you; and my heart aches for one little token that you are mine. Kiss me just once!" She bent coldly over him, as if in mere passive obedience, and just touched her lips to his forehead. That was all He rose, and passed from the room. Soon after a servant entered bearing a bouquet of costly exotics, and a basket of hot-house fruit. Her husband had brought them from the city, but he would not intrude a second time upon her presence to present them with his own hand.—"Now, Jane, dress me quickly," and the lady turned toward the mirror, with an expression of weariness on her face. "Make haste, or I shall not be ready to see Warren. I believe I'll wear that white cashmere wrapper lined with cherry satin."</p>
               <p>The quadroon's fingers moved rapidly, and in five minutes Juno's hair was arranged with graceful simplicity, and the folds of her cashmere dressing-gown tastefully disposed about her regal figure. "Now the rouge, Jane; draw my chair a little nearer to the mirror. That's right. Give me just a little hectic. There! What time is it now?"</p>
               <p>"Just half-past five, madam."</p>
               <p>"Well then, go down stairs, and be ready to wait on Warren. Tell him I've been very ill, but am somewhat better to-day, and send him up here the first thing."</p>
               <p>The girl left the room, and Juno Clifford sat there, idly toying with the silken cord about her waist. It was nearly ten minutes before she heard a footfall on the stairs, that sent a whole tide of light into her eyes. The door opened, and Warren threw<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7298-00000046"/> himself on his knees at her side, and wound his arms caressingly about her waist. This time her face was not turned away. "Mother, sweetest mother," said his earnest tones, "alas, that I find you thus. Are you very ill, mother?"</p>
               <p>"No, no, my own precious boy, I am not very ill, now you have come," and the proud head sunk on his shoulders, the warm lips pressed kiss after kiss upon his brow, his cheeks, and the blue eyes that closed lovingly beneath her caresses. "I have been so lonely, Warren, I have wanted you so much. <emph>Do</emph> you love me, my precious son?"</p>
               <p>"Do I not, mother? I should be an ingrate if I did not. You have been every thing to me. I love you more than all the rest of earth."</p>
               <p>"And always will, Warren? Tell me now, pledge it before God and angels, that no other love shall separate us; that no other shall ever be dearer than the mother of your adoption?"</p>
               <p>"I swear it, my sweetest mother."</p>
               <p>"And, Warren, if you should <emph>love</emph> some day, promise me that <emph>she</emph> shall never separate us, or come between us; that loving her, you will still be the same to me."</p>
               <p>"I promise. No woman [shall ever win my love that will not let you have the first, the holiest place in my heart. No other shall ever come between us for a moment. Loving <emph>her,</emph> I will still love you best."</p>
               <p>Even as she listened to the words of this promise, a sudden pang convulsed Juno s heart. She dared not ask herself why it was that the very thought of any other woman ever being dear to him, should thus seem to darken all her visions of the future. She resolutely turned conscience out of the counsels of her heart, and banished the unpleasing question from her memory. For a full hour she sat there, leaning back against the luxurious cushions of her chair, while Warren occupied an ottoman beside her. She inquired with tender, mother-like interest, concerning his studies, his companions, and his pleasures; and he felt more and more what a blessed thing it was to be so dear and necessary to the happiness of one, good and beautiful as he deemed Juno Clifford.</p>
               <p>It was nearly seven o'clock before Mr. Clifford came up stairs to bid his son welcome. "Well, Warren, my boy," he said, in a kind, cheerful tone, as he entered, "I thought I would let your mother have you for the first hour without interruption. She has been wanting you terribly during her illness. It has been lonesome for her here. I've had to spend all the day in town—that is, I couldn't get out before five o'clock," and he concluded his sentence with a sigh, at the thought how little difference his presence or absence made in the calculations of his wife.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Warren, rising, "you are looking terribly feverish. You must go to bed. We won't<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7298-00000047"/> let her tire herself with sitting up here; will we, father?"</p>
               <p>"I think we mustn't," and Mr. Clifford came toward her, and taking her in his arms, carried her across the room, and laid her on the bed. "Thank you," she whispered with such a smile as he had not been able to call to her lips in many a day, and he stood over her, smoothing her pillow, and arranging the drapery around her couch, in an ecstasy of delight.</p>
               <p>"Go now, both of you," she said, gently. "It is my turn to be generous, and stay alone. You can coax the housekeeper to give you a broiled chicken, Warren, and your father will join you. Since I've been too ill to go down stairs, he dines in town, and takes an early supper at home."</p>
               <p>"But I don't like leaving you here alone, mamma.'</p>
               <p>"Well, you may send Jane to me then, but go. Don't you see how impatient I am to be rid of you?"</p>
               <p>The boy smiled, and kissing her gently passed from the room.</p>
               <p>A week after he sat by her side, as usual. She did not, as yet, consider herself able to go down stairs, but she looked quite well and very lovely. "It seems so nice to have you at home, Warren,'' she said pleasantly," so very nice, that it is a strong temptation to keep you here always."</p>
               <p>"Well, mother darling, when I have been through college, I shall be home long enough for you to get tired of me. Shall I read to you now? But wait a moment. There comes James with the mail." There was a note for Juno from a fashionable friend, and a packet of papers for Warren. "From Malcom Hastings," he exclaimed as he untied them; "what! and here's our Glenthorne paper," and he unfolded "The Glenthorne Mercury." Juno was engaged in the perusal of her dainty-looking missive, and there was silence for a few moments, while he glanced rapidly over the local news. Warren broke it with the exclamation, "Isn't it sweet? isn't it touching? My own little Grace. Just look here, mother."</p>
               <p>Juno raised her drooping eyelids, and looked at him inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"Shall I read it, mamma?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, certainly, any thing you like," she replied with an affected carelessness which ill concealed her real anxiety. He read the poem with flushed cheek and kindling eye, and yet to others it would scarcely have afforded a momentary interest. The rhythm, however, was quite sweet and natural. It ran thus:—</p>

               <p>"Poor little Grace," he said, half sorrowfully, when he concluded." She must have felt sad when she wrote that, mustn't she, mother? You haven't told me, yet, whether you don't think it beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"You said 'my Grace' in speaking of her, Warren, and I feared I might pain you by differing with you in opinion. The stanzas are well enough, but I really cannot see any great amount of poetic merit about them. Are they not rather obscure?" and as she spoke, she reached forward and possessed herself of the paper. "We are informed that Miriam sat spinning, and a stranger came, but the author doesn't explain how it was that he had the boldness to go straight to love-making. Then we are quite left in the dark whether he was false, or afraid of the snow-storm, only we know for some reason he didn't come back."</p>
               <p>Warren's face showed that he felt hurt by the tone of her reply, but he answered deprecatingly—</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7298-00000049"/>
               <p>"Why, mamma, that's the suggestive style of poetry, and I thought it so beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Did you? Um-m! I suppose it was the fault of my taste, or perhaps I am not quite well enough as yet to appreciate poetry. But, Warren, draw your chair nearer, dear, and tell me all about this sweet Grace. Why have you never mentioned her before? Perhaps I shall find so much to admire in her character, that it will lend a charm to her poetry."</p>
               <p>Warren complied with her request. It was a real pleasure to find her so interested in his friend. He told her every particular of their acquaintance—how like a beautiful picture the young girl looked when he first saw her—and how after that he had met her almost daily; how the summonsto Clifford Hall had found him at her side, and she had seemed so sorry to part with him. Juno listened very gently, schooling her face to wear an expression of pleased sympathy, and when he concluded she quietly remarked—"How sweet and lovely she must be, Warren. But how long I have kept you with me. Go now, and take the air for a while. I am weary, and need rest; I shall never get it, though, while you are here, for I'm sure to talk to you as long as you stay."</p>
               <p>He kissed her, and went out, and then that haughty woman clasped her hands across her eyes and wept. In that hour she had met with a revelation. The seals fell from her eyes. She knew then that with no <emph>mother's</emph> love had she cherished the child of her adoption. There had, indeed, been such a love at first, but it had passed away long ago; and in its stead she, the cherished wife of another, had yielded up her heart to the handsome, manly youth, in wild, tumultuous worship. Juno Clifford! Was there no voice in that hour from your silenced conscience? Had your guardian angel deserted you utterly, that there came to your mind no shuddering at the deadly gin with which your soul was stained? Not one tear was for your guilt, not one resolve had for its keystone repentance. She loved him, and she could not win him. For that cause fell those burning tears. "And yet why not?" she exclaimed, calming herself with a sudden effort—"Why not win him?" Once that this thought had dawned upon her mind, she clung to it with strange pertinacity. "I am only twelve years older than he,"she mused on,"and am I not beautiful? <emph>He</emph> says mine is the fairest face his eyes ever rested on. Is it so impossible that he should love me? "Then came the memory of other ties—she was John Clifford's wife. The guilty woman paused. There were whirlpools of crime before which even her reckless thoughts stood still and shuddered. Even then, false as she was in heart, she would have hesitated to become criminal in act. But why not hope? "she once more asked herself. "John Clifford was fifty years old, and he was not come of a<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7298-00000050"/> long-lived stock. At least, she could take care that Warren did not learn to love another; she had influence enough for that. But Grace!"—For a few moments she seemed buried in profound thought, then she said aloud, "No, he does not love the girl as yet. He spoke as calmly as if she were his sister. The idea has never entered his head. But it might, if he returned there. The only hope is in removing him from her influence." A smile crossed her face; not a sunny, happy smile, but one of almost sardonic beauty. An angel might have wept to see her then. She drew a small Geneva watch from underneath her pillow. The hands pointed at a quarter to five. She bathed her tear-stained face with water of roses. She applied a soothing cream to her parched lips, and then she rang for her maid. "Jane," she said, in an impetuous tone, "hurry; make me just as handsome as you possibly can. What was that dress Mr. Clifford said he liked to see me wear? There, now, do my hair; and Jane, hand me those moss rose-buds your master brought home yesterday, and then go down stairs, and send him to me just as soon as he arrives."</p>
               <p>She turned to the mirror, as the girl went out, and twined two or three of the buds among her tresses, and then sank gracefully into a chair.</p>
               <p>"Alone, Juno?" said her husband, entering.</p>
               <p>"Yes, all alone, and I've been wanting you sadly."</p>
               <p>He came forward, his face fairly radiant with joy, and took a low seat at her feet, reverently raising her hand to his lips. Oh! but Juno Clifford had not studied human nature in vain. She knew well the secret workings of the heart, and this was perhaps the strongest element in her irresistible power of fascination. She sat silently for a time, smoothing his hair with her hand, almost as if she loved him; and then, while his pulses were thrilling at the unwonted caress, she said, with a charming frankness, "My husband, I love Warren very dearly; I have been unhappy sometimes, for fear you did not love him as well as I do."</p>
               <p>This was a master-stroke of policy. After that, John Clifford would have despised himself for ever, could he have cherished one single emotion of jealousy in connection with the boy he himself had first given to his childless wife. He smiled as she spoke, and still holding her hand in his own, answered earnestly—"Yes, Juno, I do love Warren. He is dearer to me than any one on earth, except my wife; and she surely will not blame me, if I love her so entirely, any other love seems weak in comparison?"</p>
               <p>Juno bowed her haughty head upon his shoulder, to conceal the satirical smile which she felt was curving her lip. Lifting it, after a moment, she remarked—"Then surely, John, you would be as grieved as I, to have a year of Warren's life go to waste, or to have him contract an ill-placed attachment, which would injure his whole future?"</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7298-00000051"/>
               <p>"Of course, but is there any such danger?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, there is if he remains at Glen-thorne. He has shown me, this afternoon, a love-sick poem written by a young student of the Female Seminary, and I should judge the longest lessons he has learned of late, were taught him by her eyes. Then, too, from his description, and from the poem, I am very sure she is not such a person as we would wish him to marry if he were through with his studies. He is well prepared to enter college now. I do not think he loves this girl as yet, and the best way to prevent it, will be to have him enter Yale this fall. You can tell him you have come to the conclusion he had better go in the Freshman year, and then he need return no more to Glen-thorne. But we must carefully conceal the motive of this change, or we shall occasion the very thing we wish to prevent. He is too high-spirited, much as he loves us, to permit any interference in an affair of that kind. Am I right, my husband?"</p>
               <p>"You are always right, Juno."</p>
               <p>"And beside," she added, blushingly, "he is much too young to think of marriage. You were twenty years older than him when we were married. Did you ever repent waiting?"</p>
               <p>"Repent!" That word was his only answer. He had not been so blest in years. He bent over her, and rested his head in her lap. Juno sat there very patiently. It amused her to play with his feelings, to see how skilfully she could mould that strong man to her wishes; and now, with his head bowed in an ecstasy upon her lap, she sat there, lounging negligently back in her chair, and wondering, with no shudder at her own wickedness, how much longer the old man would see fit to cumber the ground.</p>

               <head>VII. DICK.</head>
               <p>IT was a raw, cold winter day, in Warren Clifford's first college vacation. He had spent a week with Juno, in her winter residence, on Mount Vernon street, and was now passing a few days at a fashionable hotel in New York, with his friend and chum, Percy Douglass. He was to start on his return to Boston, the next morning, and the idea entered his head, that he would like to carry home some costly and beautiful present to his mother. Taking his friend's arm, he strolled down Broadway, and entered a certain noted establishment, unrivalled then, as well as now, for the chaste and costly elegance of its importations. He selected a magnificent opera cloak of crimson velvet, and ordered it sent to his hotel.</p>
               <p>"Dick," called the salesman, in an authoritative tone. The name awoke a chord of remembrance in Warren's heart, which had long been slumbering. He had never chanced to know but one person who bore that name, and he turned round, almost expecting to see the open, spirited face of his little brother; the curling chestnut hair, the sparkling hazel eyes, and the athletic figure, with the threadbare cap and patched, comfortless garments. The boy of almost sixteen, who answered the summons, was quite a different looking person. He was well, though not richly dressed, handsome, and manly-looking for his age, with an honest yet fearless expression of countenance. And yet in Warren's heart, the newly wakened chord kept or vibrating. His long-lost brother was indeed before him. There were twenty reasons which came to his mind, in the brief moment afforded him for consideration, why he ought not to recognize his brother. In the first place, the very condition on which he was entitled to his stately home, his fine education, and more than all, the love of his beautiful mother, was that he should neither write nor speak to any of his family. Beside, it was the wish and pride of his adopted parents, that he should pass for their own child, wherever it was possible; and the friend who was with him, the only son of the haughty General Douglass, had never heard the story of his adoption. No, he must not betray the secret, and if he did, what would it avail? Honor, he thought, forbade him to make any inquiries concerning his family, and it would seem less heartless not to speak at all, and leave Dick to suppose that perhaps he did not know him. So he bit his lip, and remained silent, and yet, all the while,<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7298-00000053"/> reason as he would, the newly wakened chord kept on vibrating.</p>
               <p>Dick looked earnestly in his face, as he received the bundle from the salesman's hands. His color came and went—his lips parted, and he seemed to restrain himself with difficulty. But he turned, and walked resolutely out of the shop. He had left the bundle, and was on his return, when he again encountered Warren and his friend. He crossed the side-walk, and said, in a low tone, close to his brother's ear—"Good-bye, brother Warren." Then turning, he walked away, pale as death, his lips firmly shut, and his long eye-lashes heavy with glittering tears. Percy Douglass turned round inquiringly. Warren's face was flushed, and his whole manner agitated in the extreme. "Percy," he said, hurriedly, "let me beg that' you will ask me no questions, for I should feel it due to your friendship to answer them. This affair involves a family secret, which I am not at liberty to disclose, and yet no blame attaches to any one. Is it too much to ask that you will believe me, and trust me? At some future day, I may be at liberty to tell you all."</p>
               <p>"Surely, Warren, my friendship would be of small value if such an incident could weaken my trust in you. Take your own time for an explanation, and never tell me, if it be any thing I ought not to know."</p>
               <p>That night, when business hours were over, a kind hand was laid upon Dick's shoulder. He looked up Simon Goldthwaite stood before him. Simon was the paymaster and head clerk, the confidential chargé d'affaires. He was a unique specimen of a genuine Yankee. One look at him would have convinced you he never could have been born out of New England. Tall and large, he had, in spite of his strength, an appearance of being very loosely put together. He walked with a kind of characteristic shuffle; his limbs seemed as much too long for his body, as his clothes were too short at the extremities. The very features of his face were at sixes and sevens. His hair, about an inch and a half in length, would, most persistently, stand straight up, all over his head. Perhaps this effect was aided by his constant, but ineffectual attempts to run his fingers through it. Every individual hair was so at war with its neighbor, that it did not afford safe neutral ground even for a goose-quill. There was no particular fault to be found with his nose or his forehead, or indeed any of his features, only no two of them looked as if they could, by any possibility, have been designed to go together. The mouth was wide, and very often wide open, and the nose and chin were as unlike as a Gothic church and a Parisian villa. The chin was a respectable and firm-looking affair, short and broad, while the nose was long and somewhat peaked. In addition to these various personal qualifications, he had the fullest confidence of his<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7298-00000054"/> —employers, and was the very soul of kindness and fidelity.</p>
               <p>"Well, Dick, what is it?" he exclaimed, in his hearty, kind-sounding voice—"some boyish scrape, or a piece of real trouble?"</p>
               <p>The kind words were too much for poor Dick. The tears choked his utterance, as he answered, "Oh, sir, if you only knew!"</p>
               <p>"Well, to know, is just what I want. I've seen enough in the few months that you've been here, to be satisfied that you are a good, faithful boy, and I may be able to help you in more ways than you dream of. Come, now, just walk into my counting-room, and tell me all about it. It'll be quiet there. Come along."</p>
               <p>Dick followed him, grateful for his sympathy, and yet half reluctant to expose his family affairs to the consideration of a stranger. Perhaps Simon guessed this feeling, for he said in a low, half-sorrowful tone—"Come, you needn't be afraid to trust me. If you need help, I can afford to help you, for I've no kith or kin in the wide world. My mother and my little sunny-haired sister Lizzie died of starvation, when I was four years old. Of starvation! Do you hear, Dick? Young as I was, I can remember it perfectly. My father lost all he had in an unfortunate speculation, and was thrown into prison for debt. He died there of a broken heart. My mother was sick, and she could get nothing to do. Lizzie was two years older than I, and mother used to send her out into the streets to beg. But the poor little thing would get chilled and frightened, and come back again empty-handed. And so we lay and starved. Dick, I always give to beggars. God said, 'The poor ye have always with you;' and I should be afraid to go home at night, if I had turned away pitiless from a pleading face and an outstretched hand. My mother and sister both died in one night. I was so weak then, I couldn't walk; but little as I was, I bore it better than they did, for my nature was more hardy. Oh, how distinctly I remember it. We all three went to bed together, on our heap of straw, and in the morning, when the sunshine stole in at the broken window, it wakened me. My mother's arm felt very cold. I put up my lips to kiss her, and her face was colder still. I turned to Lizzie, but she couldn't speak, or open her blue eyes, and her little bounding limbs were stiff and motionless. That morning our landlord came to turn us out of doors. We were bad tenants, we hadn't paid our rent. But he found the debtor's widow in a sleep from which his voice could not waken her. They buried them both that day, and took me to the alms-house. Ah, Dick, these are such memories as are seared upon the soul. There is no such thing as forgetfulness possible. They have been my safeguard against temptation. But I bear a lonely heart. Let me help you in your sorrows, and it will make my own lot easier."</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7298-00000055"/>
               <p>Silently Dick pressed his hand; for a moment his heart was too full to speak. Then he cleared his voice, and said in a low tone—"Since you too have suffered, Mr. Goldthwaite, you will understand my mother's situation five years ago. A lonely Englishwoman in a strange land—her fatherless children around her, and not a sixpence to buy them a loaf of bread. There were four of us; Warren, Emmie, Mabel and I. Warren was our eldest, and he was only twelve. One day, as he was hawking papers, a gentleman took a fancy to him, and carried him home to his wife. She liked him also. I have heard my mother say the lady was the most beautiful being she ever looked upon. That afternoon they came to our wretched dwelling. They were childless, and they offered to educate Warren, and adopt him as their own son, on condition that he should never again recognize us as his kindred, and, indeed, neither see nor speak to us. Beside taking him, they agreed to give us a comfortable home and four hundred dollars a year. What could my mother do, when we were all starving? She was sick, and suffering, and then, Warren wanted to go. She consented. When I came home, the arrangement was concluded, and the lady had gone with her husband. But oh, Mr. Goldthwaite, that was a night of fearful agony to my poor mother. Thus to give up her first-born son, and feel that she was never more to see his face on earth. I believe she suffered as much as she would have done to see him die before her eyes. But she bore it bravely for our sakes. His adopted parents have fulfilled their part of the contract faithfully. Through the kind offices of our village physician, I obtained my situation hero, and now my highest ambition is to get a salary large enough to relieve my mother from her dependence upon strangers. I know you will think this a very insufficient explanation of the agitated state in which you found me, but you have not heard all. Warren took the name of Clifford, and people say he bids fair to realize the proudest expectations of his adopted parents. He is welcomed into circles where I should be looked upon with contempt, and yet, Mr. Goldthwaite, he never can find truer friends than the mother who mourns for him day and night, and the little sisters who never forget to say his name over in their prayers. Oh how I loved him! Until he left us, we had never been separated. We knelt together every night at our mother's knee, we slept in each other's arms, and we would have shared together our last morsel. Well, I saw this cherished brother today, for the first time in five years, and he turned away his face, though I knew he recognized me, and never spoke."</p>
               <p>"Nor you either, Dick?"</p>
               <p>"Not then. I was sent to carry home a costly garment he had been purchasing, and on my return, I<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7298-00000056"/> met him once more in the open street. I walked up to him, I could not help it, and called him brother. He made no reply. He stood there as if thunderstruck at my audacity, and I left him with his fashionable friend and walked on. That was all; but oh, Mr. Goldthwaite, if you knew how I loved him; how I have dreamed at night of some chance meeting, when the voice of kindred blood would be too strong for restraint, and he would throw himself upon my neck and weep."</p>
               <p>There was a strange moisture about Simon Goldthwaite's eyes. He wouldn't have been suspected of crying for the world, but he coughed and ahemmed, and finally turned away without speaking. He came back at length, and wringing Dick's hand said, in a tone of honest, hearty sympathy, "You are a good boy, Dick. My heart warms to you, as it doesn't very often warm to any body. I can feel it all. I don't see how the fellow could help speaking to you, and yet, may-be, he made it a point of conscience. Some people have very tender consciences, nowadays. Humph! Dick, remember, you are to change boarding-places at quarter-time. It won't cost you as much as it does now. You shall share my room, for I want you where I can see to you."</p>
               <p>From that night the rough but kind-hearted man was Dick's firm and faithful friend. He himself had risen by slow degrees from the position of errand-boy boy, until, at thirty, he found himself head clerk and confidential adviser of the noted establishment he served. He could fully sympathize with the boy's loneliness and heart-sickness, and he resolved to open a path for him to success.</p>
               <p>That night, long after the turbulent hum of the great city had gradually died away; long after gayest revellers had left the theatres and assembly rooms, Warren Clifford paced restlessly to and fro in his chamber, communing with his own heart. Do what he would, the newly-wakened chord would not cease to vibrate—the voice of kindred would not be silenced. Two mournful hazel eyes seemed continually meeting his own; and a voice, tremulous with sorrow, said over and over again in his ears, "Good-bye, brother Warren." He could not resolve to condemn himself for the part he had acted. It was his duty, as he repeated many times that night to his unquiet heart; his duty to keep faith with his adopted parents. Alas, if, that hour, less worthy motives arose to haunt him, and he bowed his head before the mocking spectres of sinful pride and unchristian vanity. But? through all, he kept his promise to Juno, faithfully. She was still dearer than all the rest of earth. Not even to have knelt at his own mother's feet, and felt her hands laid in blessing upon his head, would he have stricken that proud woman's heart with a single pang. But the<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7298-00000057"/> Past was strangely distinct before him, with its early joys, its after-current of want and misery. Through the breezes blowing over its unquiet fields, he heard the distant gurgle of the waves closing over his dead father—thenthere stole to him his mother's gentle voice, and the low cadence of his sister's evening prayers, and Dick was once more beside him. He lived over again the dark days that followed—when his sick mother's face grew each day paler and thinner—when even Emmie cried for bread, and the little Mabel lifted to heaven the untroubled azure of her sightless eyes, and whispered, "The little children that Jesus holds in his arms don't ever get very hungry, do they, mamma? "Then, into the midst of all this gloom and suffering, he seemed once more to watch Juno Clifford's coming, with her grace, and her wondrous beauty, and still, even as to his childish fancy, she seemed the embodiment of all bright and lovely things; and involuntarily he whispered once more, after all this lapse of years—"The angel, mother!"</p>
               <p>It was nearly morning before he threw himself on his bed for an hour of troubled sleep, and then his dreams were as unquiet as his waking visions had been. He seemed walking through crowded streets, with Juno Clifford on his arm, and at every corner he met the sorrowful eyes of his brother Dick. Sometimes Juno would hurry him along, and laugh triumphantly as they left Dick behind them, but once he paused to speak to him. His companion was transformed to a beautiful demon, and vanished from his sight. He awoke with a shudder. It wanted but forty minutes to the time when he must start for Boston.</p>
               <p>"I have business out this evening, Juno," said John Clifford, rising and pushing back his chair, the evening after Warren's return. "I suppose your charming ladyship will want to give that new opera-cloak an airing, so Warren can take you to hear Norma; I brought home tickets."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Juno, with her most brilliant smile, but a moment after he left the room, she crossed over to Warren's chair, and putting her arm about his neck, whispered, playfully, "I believe I won't go after all, Warren. I shan't have my dear boy at home very long, and I want to see all I can of him. Will it be too great a sacrifice to stay with your mother, darling?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, it will be so much pleasanter to stay with you. Do you know I have been thinking of late how queer it sounds to hear you call me 'son;' how singular it is to say 'mother,' to one so young and beautiful!"</p>
               <p>"Flatterer!" cried the lady, playfully, but with a deep blush.</p>
               <p>"No, sweetest mother, any thing but that. You know well enough how beautiful you are, when you see it every day in your mirror, and the very passers-by<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7298-00000058"/> by in the street stand still, when they meet you, in an involuntary homage. Oh, mother, how I love beauty! I am going to marry when I find some one like you, whose face it will be such a perpetual joy to look upon."</p>
               <p>The proud woman trembled like a bashful girl as she listened. He was silent for a moment, and then he said in a husky tone—"Sit down, mother, please, I have something to tell you."</p>
               <p>She obeyed, seating herself so that her own face was in the shadow, while she could see the minutest play of his every feature revealed in the strong light. "Well, Warren?"</p>
               <p>"Mother, day before yesterday I saw Dick."</p>
               <p>"Dick? "She repeated the word with an inquiring cadence, as if she would encourage him to say more.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Dick, mother; my own brother Dick, whom I had not seen for five years."</p>
               <p>"Warren, Warren!" she exclaimed, earnestly—"did you speak to him? did you forget your promise, the conditions on which you came to us?"</p>
               <p>"No, mother, I forgot nothing. I did not speak."</p>
               <p>"And he, did he speak to you, my son?"</p>
               <p>"Only three words. I could see that my silence was agony to him. He did not reproach me, but the tone in which he said—'Good-bye, brother Warren,' will haunt me to my dying day."</p>
               <p>Juno looked at him keenly. She could see the veins swell in his forehead, and the tears gather in his eyes. She waited a moment, and then she said, in a low, sweet tone, "Come hither, Warren, my brave, noble boy, and let me hold your head upon my breast, as I have done in many another hour of trouble. You were so good and true to keep your promise at such a fearful cost. I know how hard it was, I can feel it all."</p>
               <p>Warren felt the heart beat tumultuously against which his head was lying. For a time there was silence between them. Her mute sympathy satisfied him. At length she bent over him, and whispered, "Warren, in that hour did you love me better than all? Did no longing to seek your other mother's side cross this restless heart? Remember, you have sworn I should be dearest. No other voice ever called me mother; no other child ever clasped my neck. Warren, Warren, dearer than life, answer me!"</p>
               <p>The boy looked up, with his head still lying upon her breast. He drew her hand tenderly to his lips. Then he said, "God, who hears me, knows, that in that hour even, I had not one wish to leave you. God knows that in that hour, as in all others, you were dearer to me than my own life. I could die for you so easily—try me!"</p>
               <p>"Nay, my beloved, I had rather you should live for me; "and bending over him, in her bewildering beauty, she pressed her lips to his own.</p>

               <head>VIII. WARREN'S FIRST PROPOSAL.</head>
               <p>THE first three years of Warren Clifford's college life passed rapidly away. His vacations were spent in the society of his brilliant and fascinating mother, alternately at Clifford Hall and Mount Vernon street. At twenty he was an unexceptionable type of the pure Anglo-Saxon style of manly beauty. His figure was tall, and rather slight, but well formed. His features were regular, and yet expressive, and about his manners there was a grace at once fascinating and indescribable. It was near the beginning of his senior year that an accident occurred which gave a deeper coloring to his dreams. He was sauntering carelessly through the elm-fringed streets of New Haven, arm in arm with his old friend, Percy Douglass, when his attention was attracted by a young lady, directly in front of him on the sidewalk. There was nothing remarkable about her, but from some mysterious cause, every line of her graceful figure seemed strangely familiar. She was leaning on the arm of a tall, distinguished looking girl, the hues of whose shot silk dress were bright as the glancing wing of a humming-bird. The young lady herself was attired in a sky-blue crape, entirely without ornament, and over her shoulders was thrown a simple scarf of white muslin. And yet there was about her whole costume an unmistakable air of refinement. She wore her plain straw bonnet with the most bewitching grace, and the hand that lifted for a moment the folds of her flowing dress as she crossed the street, was small and delicate. The tiny foot thus revealed, was trimly clad in silk and morocco, and her every movement betrayed the lady. For some time her face was turned towards her companion, but she glanced around, as she ascended the steps of a somewhat stately mansion, and Warren had a full profile view of a fair, sweet face, shaded by a profusion of golden ringlets. It recalled a pleasant memory of a sunset time a little more than three years before, of a fair young girl robed in white leaning against the portico of a rustic cottage. There was no mistaking that spiritual face, those delicately moulded features. "Grace!" he exclaimed, as the door closed behind her. "Good Heavens, Percy! I must see her. How shall we manage?"</p>
               <p>"Is she an old friend, Warren?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and the very dearest girl. What shall I do? I tell you I must see her."</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7298-00000060"/>
               <p>"Well, only be patient; nothing easier. This house where she has stopped is my cousin Sue Barrington's. Sue gives a party this evening, and we are both invited. Your unknown will of course be there, as she is evidently intimate. Come, Ware, you've only to moderate your transports a few hours longer."</p>
               <p>The sun was a terribly long time going down, but eight' o'clock came at last, and Warren Clifford found himself in Miss Barrington's brilliantly lighted rooms. The folding-doors were thrown open, and, as if guided by some strange intuition, his eyes were instantaneously directed to a merry group standing near the piano, in the back parlor, of which Grace seemed the centre of attraction. He advanced, with as much composure as he could summon, to pay his compliments to his hostess, and was detained a few moments by her side in conversation. Percy had left him almost immediately on his entrance, and it was nearly a quarter of an hour before he returned, with a slight, graceful figure, robed in white, leaning upon his arm. "Well, Warren, I have forestalled you," he laughed merrily—"Miss Atherton, here is my poor friend Clifford. He recognized you to-day as you came up the steps, and it took all the weight of my influence to prevent him from breaking open Miss Barrington's front door, just to get another sight at you."</p>
               <p>For a moment the blue, smiling eyes sought Warren Clifford's face, then they were suddenly cast down, till the long, golden lashes drooped upon her blushing cheeks. The hand she extended trembled in his fervent clasp. "Come with me, Grace," he whispered, drawing her arm through his own, and leading her into the hall. There he threw a shawl around her shoulders, and laughingly asked "would she borrow his hat, or should he send her to look after a bonnet."</p>
               <p>"A bonnet! what are you going to do?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing very shocking, little one, but these October evenings are rather chilly. I haven't seen you for more than three years, and I'm just going to take you out into the garden for a bit of a talk."</p>
               <p>She smiled, and running up stairs, returned with a light garden hat tied over her golden curls. The evening was beautiful. The October moon flooded the scene with its glory, and the elm-boughs waved between earth and sky, and seemed at every kiss of the wind-spirits to shiver with delight. It was a beautiful garden, through whose winding paths they walked. Its high walls o'errun with climbing vines, its sun-dial, and summer-house, gave it a somewhat English character. The autumn flowers were in the full bloom of their gorgeous beauty; dahlias, and marigolds, and sweet peas, with a score of rarer and more costly shrubs, and amid them lingered the mignonette, the summer's sweetest nursling, filling the air with its breath of perfume. They walked on for some<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7298-00000061"/> time in silence. Warren was the first to speak.—"So you thought of me sometimes, through the long three years, did you, Grade?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, very often. It was lonesome at first, when I knew you had sent for your things, and heard, through Mr. Hastings, that you weren't coming back any more. And you know you never sent me so much as a message, and pretty soon you stopped writing even to him. We thought you had quite forgotten Glenthorne."</p>
               <p>"Forgotten! How could you? I never sent you any message because I hardly felt that I had a right, and I stopped writing to Hastings because I knew he was an earnest man, living with a purpose; and though he might be too kind to refuse to answer my letters, yet they wouldn't be worth enough to warrant such a waste of his time. How is he now? The same hard worker as ever?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, only in another way. Haven't you heard how rich he is?"</p>
               <p>"No, I've heard nothing about Glenthorne. I supposed he was poor. He was thirty when I knew him, and I supposed he had his fortune still to carve out."</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, he was very rich all that time. It all came out about a year after you left Glenthorne. His property had been steadily increasing, all those years that every one thought him but a poor school teacher. He was doing that, he says, partly for mental discipline, and partly to see how many friends he could win to love him for his own sake; and, so when he was through with his experiments, he bought the old Priory grounds. You know how beautiful they were, and he has built there just the sweetest cottage you ever saw; not a little one, like ours, but a large English-looking house, with dining-room, and parlors, and library, and low windows with vines climbing over them."</p>
               <p>Warren smiled at the odd mixture of ideas in her description, and then said, carelessly, "Of course he has a Mrs. Hastings, or it would be like a very pretty bird's nest, without the bird in it."</p>
               <p>"No; unless you reckon the housekeeper, there isn't any lady at Sunny Nook. By the way, isn't that a pretty name? I told him once I thought the house seemed almost too grand and stately for it, though. But he said he meant it should just be a real home; and if he thought it did not look so, he would tear it down, and build over again; but he wanted plenty of room. Then he pointed to the hillside sloping down from the east wing of the house. It was covered with anemones and violets, and golden butter-cups. There were the most of the buttercups. It was fairly yellow with them, and the butterflies were flitting over and over, with their glancing wings, just like light. Then I understood it; I saw<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7298-00000062"/> that every little, helpless thing was free and happy there, and it was just a nook for all of them."</p>
               <p>"And so you thought I had forgotten you?" said Warren, returning again to the old subject.</p>
               <p>"It certainly looked like it, though I never could quite think so. It had to be faith, you know, and that's hard work without any evidence."</p>
               <p>"Yes"—and then Warren repeated musingly the last verse of one of Grace's own poems— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Very cold the sunshine falleth</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">On the path, he used to tread,</l>
                        <l>And her heart beats with a question—</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">'Is he false, or is he dead?'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Did you read that, Warren?" the young girl asked, with a quick blush.</p>
               <p>Warren did not notice the sudden flushing of her cheek, and he answered, quietly—"Yes, I certainly read it, and you perceive I remembered it. By the way, do you write poetry now, Gracie?"</p>
               <p>She laughed—"No, I never did write poetry. It's a funny word to be applied to silly little Grace. I used to write something that jingled, but I have pretty much given that up since I left off going to school to Mr. Hastings, and when I do write any thing I put it in the fire."</p>
               <p>"And yet it is in you, Grace, I know it is!"</p>
               <p>"What is in me? nothing very dangerous I hope; do relieve my anxiety."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Grace! I mean the genius, the inspiration. I know you have it, I always did know it, ever since that night I saw you standing and looking up to the sunset. I saw it then in your lifted glance, your ethereal figure, your whole attitude. Grace, do you want to be famous?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, I have never thought; I might, if it would make people love me, or if I could help any one by it."</p>
               <p>"But for itself, Grace. Have you no wish that the world should call you gifted; that the great and noble should do homage to your genius?"</p>
               <p>"I believe not," she answered, saucily. "I can't see that it would help me along with my geometry, or soften the heart of my deaf old music-master."</p>
               <p>"Grace, you are incorrigible. How came you here in New Haven?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I was gent to school here to be finished. I have been here ever since July, and I'm going to stay a whole year. Only think, I didn't know you were in town, until to-day, I heard Sue Barrington say you were coming to her party." She paused a moment, and then she said, in a lower tone, "Warren, have you always thought of me, when you thought of Mabel and Emmie? You promised, you know."</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7298-00000063"/>
               <p>"Yes, Gracie, always. I have seen Dick since then!"</p>
               <p>"Your own brother Dick?" Her face beamed with the intensity of her interest, though it grew somewhat shaded as she listened to his account of the interview. "And you couldn't speak to him?" she asked, sadly, as he concluded his recital.</p>
               <p>"No, it would not have been right. But I must take you into the house. I've kept you out here an hour, already. Where are you staying? Can I call on you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; you can come any time. I board at Col. Hargrave's. Sara Hargrave, or Lady Sara, as all the girls call her, is the most beautiful person you ever saw."</p>
               <p>"A song, a song," cried a half-dozen voices, as Grace entered the parlor. "Yes, and let me choose it," whispered Warren, entreatingly. He led her to the piano, and turned the leaves of a music-book, till he found a ballad he remembered to have heard his own mother sing, in his early boyhood. While she was singing, he hung over the piano, too much absorbed even to turn the leaves of the music. His mind was making pictures of his early life, his mother, his gentle sisters, and his brother Dick, and ever among them, as if she were one of themselves, came the sweet face of Grace Atherton. Later in the evening, while Grace was dancing with one of his classmates, he was presented to Miss Hargrave—Lady Sara! She was certainly worthy of her title. Her beauty was somewhat in the Juno Clifford style. That is, she had heavy braids of glossy black hair, and large, passionate black eyes, but her complexion, instead of Juno's brilliant olive, was pale and clear as the finest marble, and her features were very different. Every movement of her stately figure betokened high, vigorous health. The blood evidently bounded, rather than flowed through her veins. Her features were by no means what is called spiritual, and yet they had an indefinable expression of purity. Her brow was calm, and lofty, and her haughty mouth wore a look of high resolve, tempered by feminine gentleness. On the whole, you would have pronounced her no angel, but a woman, very high-toned, and very beautiful. She wore what not another lady in the room could have worn—a dress of deep crimson velvet, so long as to sweep the carpet with the heavy folds. She was entirely without ornament, save a cluster of white lilies in her hair, and a single diamond, fastening the point-lace folds upon her bosom.</p>
               <p>That night, Warren's dreams were a little confused. Two faces haunted them—one very sweet, very gentle, very delicate; the other, sparkling, entrancing, bewilderingly beautiful. He became a frequent visitor at Col. Hargrave's. It was a debatable point in his<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7298-00000064"/> own mind, which of the young ladies he went to see, and as they were usually together, it did not much matter. If either of them were out, the other became the reigning divinity for the time being. And so it chanced that the last evening he was to spend in New Haven previous to his spring vacation, finding Miss Hargrave alone, he invited that young lady to be his companion in a long walk. She was quite bewildering in walking costume, with a shawl of crimson cashmere folded about her regal figure, and her white leghorn bonnet just shading her beautiful face, and deepening the contrast of her dark hair. It was a lovely evening, and the path they had chosen led through one of the sweetest spots in all the environs of New Haven. Their conversation was very interesting; and the scene, the hour, above all, the radiant woman by his side, were quite excuse enough, to any reasonable person, for a very susceptible young gentleman coming to the conclusion that he was in love. At least Warren Clifford thought them so. "I am so happy," he exclaimed, fervently, as they seated themselves to rest, upon a moss-grown seat, in the full moonlight.</p>
               <p>"You are too easily influenced. You live too much in the present," said Lady Sara, quietly. "Such happiness is unstable, it comes and goes as the wind changes."</p>
               <p>"But is not living in the present the only true and real life?"</p>
               <p>"In one sense it is. We must do the present duty without looking remorsefully back over the past, or longingly onward into the far fields of the future. 'By little and little' must the high wall be built. But it was not that I meant. We must not suffer ourselves thoughtlessly to enjoy every thing that seems pleasant for the time. We must not forget that just as surely as, for the earth, there is seed-time and harvest, there is, for every little act, its consequence on earth and in Heaven!" Her face, as she spoke, seemed radiant with inspiration—it was sublime. Warren threw himself at her feet, and pressed her hand to his lips.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lady Sara," he exclaimed, passionately—"I love you, I adore you. Be ray teacher, you can make me what you will. Only promise to be my wife, my guardian angel!"</p>
               <p>The lady smiled, but it was not a smile to give courage to a lover's heart. "Please to get up," she said, with an amused tone. Our hero arose, with an air somewhat crest-fallen, and seated himself beside her. "I don't want you to say any more such things to me," she continued, "because you do not mean them. You may fancy me, but you love Grace Atherton. I have known it ever since that first evening I saw you together, and if you don't know it now, you'll find it out soon enough."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you are right" said Warren, submissively.</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7298-00000065"/>
               <p>"Right? I am certain of it. Beside, I thought you knew I was the betrothed wife of Joseph Seaton, else I should never have treated you with such sister-like freedom. I forgot though, he has been out of New Haven ever since you commenced visiting at the house."</p>
               <p>"Well, my lady, it seems to me you've a mighty straightforward way of telling of your engagement," was Warren's thought, but he simply said, "I congratulate you, Miss Hargrave; but, pardon me, I thought you were very proud."</p>
               <p>"What then?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, only Joseph Seaton is a poor beneficiary student, and will be a poor clergyman! "</p>
               <p>"Yes, and yet I am prouder of him than any thing else on earth. I bow to talent and goodness, and not to gold dollars."</p>
               <p>"And yet, I can hardly conceive of you as a minister's wife."</p>
               <p>Lady Sara's beautiful eyes filled with tears, and she spoke, after a moment, in a tone of suppressed agitation—"I know I am unworthy—I feel it. I have told him so many a time. Oh, I know it is a glorious destiny to tread a path that has led in other days to crowns of martyrdom—too high for me; too high and too pure. But I love him, and I love his work. My weak hands, but strong love, may strengthen him some times, and his teaching will make me every day more worthy of the name I bear!"</p>
               <p>"And I?" Warren's inquiring tone had a deep cadence of sadness.</p>
               <p>Her eyes sparkled with enthusiasm through her tears—"Oh, you will marry Grace Atherton, and be happy. I predict for you a glorious future, if you can only be true to yourself. God has given you a splendid character, though I have sometimes feared that only some great shock will rouse you to self-dependence, and lofty action. I know what you can be—we shall see in the future what you will be! But come, let us go home, I must not engross all your last evening!"</p>
               <p>They found Grace in the drawing-room at homo, with Percy Douglass for her companion. He was reading to her when they entered, and her cheek was suffused with tender interest, her soft blue eyes filled with tears. A sudden twinge of jealousy went a long way to convince Warren that Miss Hargrave had not been far wrong, when she asserted that he had loved Grace Atherton from the first. He trembled lest her heart had turned away, like a frightened bird, from the cold refuge his formal politeness had of late afforded, and gone to seek a nestling-place in another bosom. She had never seemed more lovely. He watched her graceful movements, her half-pensive face, and listened to her low, sweet tones, with a new<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7298-00000066"/> warmth at his heart. Sara Hargrave had been magnetic. She had blinded, dazzled him, as when one looks up to the sun at noontide in midsummer—Grace shone on him like the virgin moon, or the patient, ever-enduring stars, and his soul grew hushed and glad in the beams of her quiet loveliness. When he arose to go, Percy Douglass rose also, and both ladies came into the hall, and stood for a moment in the moonlight, by the open door. "Good-night," he said at length, extending his hand to Lady Sara—"you have made me this night eternally your debtor." His tone was so low, that no one else comprehended his words. Miss Hargrave understood him. She pressed his hand reassuringly, as she answered,</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is quite a long good-night. We shall not see you again for at least three weeks." He turned to Grace. He fancied he saw a blush crimson her cheek in the moonlight. For a moment her trembling fingers rested on his outstretched palm. He bent over her and whispered—"God bless my sweetest sister!" The blue eyes were raised to his face. The trembling hand very slightly returned his pressure; he took his friend's arm, and walked thoughtfully to his room.</p>

               <head>IX. THE VALEDICTORY.</head>
               <p>IT was in Clifford Hall that Warren Clifford found Juno. She had removed from the city a month earlier than usual, because she remembered to have heard him express a preference for their country home. All his little tastes had been carefully consulted. She had even taken care to remove his favorite paintings from Mount Vernon street, and to superintend in her own person the arrangement of his room. He entered the house unobserved, and proceeded immediately to his mother's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir.</foreign> She was reclining, in one of her listless moods, upon a lounge. The quadroon sat at a little distance, reading aloud one of Byron's impassioned poems. Every thing was at once so bright and so gorgeous, that you might have fancied it a scene from one of the Arabian tales. The crimson furniture, the summer-like temperature of the room, the mirrors, multiplying indefinitely all this splendor, the soft-eyed pictures, the empress-like woman upon the lounge, the dusky grace<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7298-00000067"/> of the quadroon, conveyed an indefinable impression of enchantment.</p>
               <p>The door swung noiselessly open, and Warren entered. Juno uttered a quick, glad cry of recognition, and springing up, clasped him to her heart. The quadroon lifted her eyes from the pages of the <foreign xml:lang="TUR">Giaour,</foreign> and bent them upon the two standing before her, with a look of keen scrutiny. Juno understood the glance, and said, somewhat less commandingly than usual, "You can go now, Jane; I shall not want any more reading this afternoon." The girl obeyed, and then turning to Warren, the lady murmured—"Thank Heaven, dearest, that you are come. Sit down, and let me talk to you." She laid her head upon his shoulder, and looked inquiringly up into his face. "Have you been true, Warren? I dreamed last night that some one else had won you away from me. Oh, Warren! I should die if it were real. I thought she was beautiful as an angel. You held her hand, and looked into her eyes, and your mother's love was forgotten."</p>
               <p>"And thus go dreams by most delicious contrarieties." Warren bent over and kissed her, as he quoted the line.</p>
               <p>"Are you sure? Has not your heart wandered? Am I dearest still?"</p>
               <p>Warren thought of Lady Sara, but his regard for her seemed a mere admiration, a passing fancy. Then Grace Atherton's image rose up before him, in her youth, her innocence, her quiet loveliness; but he felt even she could never be as dear as the beautiful woman who had been his idol from boyhood, and he answered very fervently, "Now, and always, you are dearest, my own mother. Have I not sworn no other love should come between us?"</p>
               <p>Juno seemed satisfied; her only answer was to draw his hand caressingly to her lips. For a time they sat there in silence. Once more in his mother's presence, Warren half doubted whether his love for Grace Atherton had, after all, been more than a fervent friendship. He had resolved, that for the present he would not mention her to Mrs. Clifford, and he found this resolution by no means difficult to keep. If he had thought Sara Hargrave magnetic, Juno was ten times more so. Her power over him was bewildering. Under its influence, he had not a single thought for any one else. He would sit by her side, read to her, follow her from room to room, drive her out in her little pony carriage, or lay his head in her lap, and listen to her singing, in a perfect trance of delight. He was so absorbed, it seemed a surprise when the gong sounded for dinner, when it was bed-time, or when Mr. Clifford returned in the afternoon. And yet, all this time, his love was pure as Heaven, He knew, indeed, that she was a graceful and beautiful woman, scarcely twelve years older than himself. He had heard of marriages, happy ones, with more<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7298-00000068"/> than that difference; but he thought of her only as his mother, always gentle to him, however proud and imperious she might be to others. He loved her almost adoringly, and yet, in the midst of her fascinations, he had many times made fancy pictures about some future day, when he would bring home a sweet young wife, who should love his mother even as he did, and whom Juno would welcome for his sake.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he would speak to her of this, and she would smile upon him very sweetly, keeping down the bitterness in her heart, and say—"that day was a good way in the future. He was too young to think of such things now. He must be her own pet boy a few years longer."</p>
               <p>Sometimes the quadroon would hear these remarks, as she braided up her mistress's hair, and Juno looking at her face in the mirror opposite, would notice that same peculiar look which had attracted her attention on the evening of Warren's arrival. Mr. Clifford was more than ever absorbed in his business. Through the mismanagement of the European partner, the house had lost heavily in some foreign stock speculations. Not enough, indeed, to affect his magnificent private fortune, or in the least endanger the business reputation of the firm, but still enough to be a source of perplexity and vexation. There was one room at Clifford Hall which he called his study. Its plainness and simplicity were in striking contrast to the splendor of the remaining portion of the house. He passed most of the time he spent at home, in this room, shut up with his books and papers. The furrows of care deepened on his brow, and his locks grew grayer and grayer, and Juno Clifford, watching him drooped the lashes over her flashing eyes, and thought in the depths of her guilty, miserable heart, that he had not many more years to be in the way. She was very gentle to him, nowadays, and seemed far more thoughtful of his comfort than of old; and yet in his hours of trial and loneliness, he had no wife but the imaginary one to sit beside him, and kiss the shadows from his brow.</p>
               <p>Warren stood alone at the window of the spacious drawing-room, the evening before he returned to Yale. It was what the country folks call an early spring. The sun was just setting, and he was watching the pageantry of clouds in the pathway of the fallen monarch, and turning his eyes, from time to time, upon the garden walks, growing so gay with flowers. He felt an arm steal softly around his neck, and turning, met Juno's reproachful gaze. "Going away tomorrow morning, Warren, and yet watching the sun go down alone?"</p>
               <p>"I was just coming to you, mother."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my boy, Warren, these partings kill me."</p>
               <p>"But this one is only for three months, mother darling, and then I am coming home to stay."</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7298-00000069"/>
               <p>"I know it, but who can tell what new grief those three months may bring? It is like being shut out of Heaven to have you leave me!"</p>
               <p>"Don't, mother. Oh, if you only knew how your grief pains me. It almost makes me resolve not to go back, and yet I have such high hopes for this last term."</p>
               <p>"Will you realize them?"</p>
               <p>"I am almost certain of it. Remember, you promised to come and rejoice in my success. And now let us go to the piano. The twilight is just falling, and I so love to have your twilight songs to dream over."</p>
               <p>When Warren Clifford called at Col. Hargrave's for the first time after his return, there was a timid, yet delighted agitation in Grace Atherton's manner, that gave him keen emotions of delight, notwithstanding the indifference he had been professing to his own heart, during his recent sojourn at Clifford Hall. Joseph Seaton had returned, and as he engrossed Miss Hargrave's attention during most of the evenings, those short delicious evenings of spring and summer, Warren had many uninterrupted opportunities for conversation with Miss Atherton. More and more was he charmed with the unaffected simplicity and purity of her character.</p>
               <p>Many an hour they rambled through the lovely envi rons of New Haven, with the whispering elm-boughs between them and the moonlight. Daily he realized that his soul grew purer, his motives higher, for her gentle influence. His love for her was very deep, but calm and quiet, and so healthful. It never lured him from his duty, but only served to strew flowers in his pathway toward the true and right. There was none of the subtle magnetic fascination, by which Juno Clifford had power to make him deem "the worse, the better reason." He seldom considered whether she was beautiful. He well knew there was nothing in her quiet loveliness to attract a moment's admiration by the side of Juno's superb figure, and dark, bewildering eyes; but he felt that it was a very sweet face, nevertheless.</p>
               <p>He found her capable of sympathizing in his highest pursuits. Triumphantly he sought her side, when the honor for which he was striving, the appointment of valedictorian, had been awarded him. "I am so glad," she said, innocently, lifting her sweet blue eyes. Warren had much ado to avoid straining her then and there to his heart; it was so dear a thing to see the glow of pleasure his success brought to that young face. But he was acquiring self-control, and had resolved to wait, for a time, before attempting to win her love. He wished to be secure of his own constancy. He had too high a soul to win a young heart, and then leave it to break; and too ardent im<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7298-00000070"/> pulses to be happy with a wife whom he did not idolize. He had resolved to be quite certain, before hazarding her happiness, or his own; so he merely thanked her by an expressive look, and then begged her to choose his subject.</p>
               <p>It was not till the evening before commencement, that he felt sufficiently assured of his position to declare his love. Leading her to a sylvan nook, which looked a very temple for lovers' vows, he sat down beside her, and recounted the story of the Past. He spoke of their early friendship, of their first meeting at New Haven. Then he confessed the spell, under whose influence he had become a suitor for Miss Hargrave's hand, and told her how patiently he had waited ever since, that he might be fully assured of his own constancy; and then he said, in the low earnest tones, of profound truth—"I know I am not worthy of you, my sweet Grace, but I do believe that you have more power than any other to make me what a true man ought to be. I love you with a love that can never waver, and I will consecrate my whole life to your happiness. Such as I am, will you take me, Gracie?"</p>
               <p>Grace bowed her head upon her hand, and wept. He thought she pitied him, because her heart gave forth no response to his words. "Nay, then, Grace, darling," he whispered, bending over her, and feeling a perverse dimness stealing over his own eyes at the same time,—"Nay, then, do not weep for me. I am not worth those tears. Only speak to me; I must hear my fate in words, though it be to go out from your presence with an anguished heart."</p>
               <p>Her hands dropped quietly upon her lap, and she looked up, her eyes making sunshine through the falling tears—"Warren," her tone was fairly tremulous with joy, "do you not see, if I weep, it is because this is greater happiness than I have ever dared to hope? Warren, I have loved you all these years!"</p>
               <p>For an instant he caught her hand in both his own—he murmured, passionately, "God in Heaven bless you, darling," then he pressed upon her brow a single kiss, the pure token of their betrothal. For a time they talked of the future, with all that earnest hope of which young and happy hearts have an inexhaustible treasury. It might be still some time ere Warren could claim his bride, since it would depend on the will of his parents; but she was to remain in the mean while at Glenthorne, and see and hear from him very often. In the whole star-lighted sky of their future, to those loving eyes there seemed no single cloud. Then after a time there was silence between them, that sweet, delicious silence of two hearts which love has made one, so much more eloquent than words.</p>
               <p>At length Grace broke the spell. She drew a letter from her pocket. "Did I tell you papa will be here to-morrow morning to take me home?"</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7298-00000071"/>
               <p>"What! Your school closed to-day, did it not; but surely, Gracie, you will wait to hear my address. You know you chose the subject."</p>
               <p>"I hope so. I am almost certain I can persuade papa to permit it. He is always indulgent. But any way we must say good-bye to-night. We should go, at least as soon as the orations are over, and you will have no time to attend to me to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"That is true. My mother is to spend to-night at a friend's house four miles out of the city, and she will be in, early in the morning. Beside, there are the processions of students, and the bustle, and confusion. Yes, it must come to-night, but, it will not be for very long. I shall visit Glenthorne as soon as I get rested. I wish I <emph>could</emph> see your father to-morrow, and ask him to give me my little wife." For an hour or two longer they sat upon the moss-grown seat. In spite of the coming parting, they were very happy. Nineteen and twenty-one are ages when the spirits are too elastic to be long borne down by any grief which is not utterly hopeless. There were few words spoken, but he held her hand fervently clasped in his own, with a pressure, which seemed to promise, over and over again, love and protection for all the future. "We <emph>must</emph> go home," whispered Grace, at length; "see how late it is getting. The moon is almost down, and you look so very tired to-night. You must go home and rest."</p>
               <p>He rose, and lifting up her face towards the moonlight, looked earnestly into her eyes. "Yes, <emph>you</emph> must go home, my pet dove, you need rest more than I do. Grace, promise me once more that no fate shall utterly part us, that come what may, you will be my own true wife for ever."</p>
               <p>"I will!"</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Grace; I trust in your words as if an angel had spoken them, and never, never come what may of trial or trouble—never, as I hope for Heaven's mercy, shall another head rest on my heart. You shall be mine, or I will have no bride but death!" And so they walked homeward, hand in hand, pondering over in their hearts the vow which they had vowed unto the Lord. At the door Warren paused. "I cannot go in," he said, "it is late, and I do not want to say good-night before any other eyes than the stars of Heaven!"</p>
               <p>"It must be <emph>good-bye</emph> this time!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; but courage, darling, it will be only for a little while. In two weeks I shall be with you at Glenthorne, and in the mean time I will write you. You will hear from me in a week at farthest. One thing, Grace, promise me that you will love Mrs. Clifford for my sake. I know it will be a bitter grief to her, to hear that my heart has chosen to itself an idol; but she loves me so, she will bear it for my sake without a murmur. I am all she has to love except<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7298-00000072"/> my father, and I have sometimes thought there was a shadow between her heart and his. He is so different from her, in her youth and the splendor of her beauty. I have told her, that if ever I brought home a bride, my wife should love her even as I love her. Can you fulfil this promise, Grace?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dearest, for the sake of all her tenderness to you, I will love her gladly."</p>
               <p>And now he put his arm around her, and drew her passionately to his bosom for the first time. He pressed his lips to hers in a long, lingering kiss; he smoothed tenderly back the soft waves of her hair; he called her his child, his pet, his little darling; and then gathering courage for the effort, he said, earnestly, as he put her from him, "Good-bye, sweetest Grace, God in Heaven bless you, my bride, my beloved."</p>
               <p>Never had a commencement been more brilliant. The galleries were thronged with crowds of beautiful women; there were rustling silks and glancing fans, fluttering of veils and waving of handkerchiefs, and that morning Juno Clifford had come. She met Warren with a triumphant smile. His father shook hands with him heartily, and uttered a few words of sincere congratulation, and now Mr. and Mrs. John Clifford sat there in front of the stage, awaiting the valedictory.</p>
               <p>There was an indistinct murmur of admiration as the young student came before the audience. He had labored wearily during all the term, and his face was very pale, while his eyes sparkled with unwonted brilliancy. His golden curls clustered short and thick upon his open brow, and his slight, elastic figure looked very graceful, arrayed in the flowing black gown of the graduates.</p>
               <p>His subject, "Oratory of the Past and the Present," had been Grace Atherton's selection, and her smiles had been his inspiration. He was calm, collected, and irresistibly eloquent. His clear, deep voice filled the house with its melody, and all else was so still, you could almost have listened to the beating of your own heart. And ever, as he spoke, there were two seats on which the young student's eyes turned lingeringly.</p>
               <p>In one sat a woman, proud, radiant, beautiful. Her heavy brocade dress, her sleeves and stomacher of costliest lace, the ostrich feathers curling around her leghorn hat, and the diamonds sparkling on neck, arms, and the ungloved hand which was carelessly twirling a fan, gorgeous with the plumage of tropical birds; all betokened the extreme of wealth and fashion. Her dark, magnetic eyes were bent eagerly upon the speaker. In her attitude, as she sat leaning back against the cushioned seat, there was a kind of indolent grace, a luxurious <foreign xml:lang="FRA">abandon;</foreign> but her<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7298-00000073"/> look was interested, intense, almost impatient. You would have thought the speaker was one in whom she had centred much of love, much of pride.</p>
               <p>The occupant of the other seat was a young girl, very slight, and very fair. She reminded you of a half-opened rose-bud. Her dress gave no evidence of wealth, and rather betokened taste than fashion. It was a simple muslin robe, with a quiet little cottage bonnet of plain straw, and a muslin mantle. And yet she was very lovely. She looked so childlike and so innocent in her white robes; leaning forward, with her wide opened blue eyes, her parted lips, and her small hands clasped upon her lap. Two loves! Juno Clifford and Grace Atherton, what could there be more of contrast? The one, magnificent in silk and diamonds, with her haughty, defiant grace, her dark, sparkling eyes, and her coronet of jetty hair; the other, so very sweet and simple in her cool muslin—so young, so pure!</p>
               <p>And yet they both loved him. You could see that one kindred element, spite of the wide dividing line of wealth and circumstance, and all which marks the exclusive kingdom of Up-Town!</p>
               <p>When he had concluded, and the house rang with applause, you might have seen a flush of satisfaction on Juno's sparkling face, and an air of triumph, as she drew her heavily wrought shawl about her regal figure. Had you looked at the young girl, you might have noted, as Warren did, a quick blush, a suffusion of the timid blue eye with proud and happy tears, and a look of half-prayerful thankfulness, M she arose to follow her father from the house.</p>

               <head>X. JUNO CLIFFORD WRITES A LETTER.</head>
               <p>WARREN CLIFFORD awoke, the morning after his return home, with a dull, heavy pain in his head and limbs. He arose, and attempted to cross the floor, but was overpowered by a strange dizziness. He had hardly strength enough to ring his bell, and inquire for Mr. Clifford. He was lying upon the bed when his father entered the room. Mr. Clifford started back, in alarm as he clasped the feverish hand, and noted the quick, irregular beating of the pulse. "Warren, poor fellow," he said, almost with a woman's tenderness of tone, "you are very ill; I shall send for Dr. Greene directly."</p>
               <p>"It's nothing but a hard headache, father, I got so very tired."</p>
               <p>"I fear we shall find it something much more serious. At least I shall be better satisfied, if I have the Doctor's opinion."</p>
               <p>"An attack of brain fever, and a very bad case," was Doctor Greene's verdict. "The young gentleman has certainly been over-worked."</p>
               <p>"It was for my sake," whispered Juno to herself, "only to gratify my miserable pride, and now if he should die!" She wrung her hands, and sank down upon her knees by the bedside. Words of prayer came to her lips for the first time in years, but it was a mad, passionate cry to Heaven, that he she loved might be spared to her. There was no penitence for her own sins, no supplication for pardon. It was only the wail of the woman's heart, guilty, miserable, unrepentant, and yet recognizing Heaven.</p>
               <p>Before nightfall Warren was delirious. For almost two weeks his fever raged with unceasing violence. He would shriek out for Juno, sometimes, in his delirium, and she would snatch his head to her bosom, and cover his fevered lips with kisses, crying out in the silence betwixt them two and Heaven, "I am here, I am here, my beloved!"</p>
               <p>For many hours each day she would banish all others from the room, and sitting as in a trance by his bedside, listen to the utterances of his frenzy. Sometimes he seemed living over again the scenes of his early childhood. He would clasp his hands, and say piteously, "Oh, mother, I cannot see you sit here and starve. Is there no help?" Then he would seem to recall the passionate farewell, when he broke from his mother's arms and walked along the crowded streets, with streaming eyes, to his new home. But more than all these, he talked of Dick. Over And<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7298-00000075"/> over again he would implore his forgiveness. He would shriek out to him not to kill him, not to look at him so with his reproachful eyes; and then he would say so pleadingly that he <emph>must</emph> keep his word, didn't Dick know he had promised?"</p>
               <p>At other times he would seem absorbed in study, and doubtful of success; and then there would be a dream of one whom he called his inspiration. Juno would have given worlds to know if he meant her. There were hours, too, in which he would fancy himself at home with her, and so happy—"Let me lay my head in your lap, mother," he would say, and then, after a moment—" There, that's right, now; please sing to me; I <emph>knew</emph> I should be better when I came home to you." One such sentence would repay that proud woman for all the weariness of her watching.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifford always stayed with him at night. The twelfth evening good Dr. Greene foretold a crisis. Juno had been with difficulty persuaded to retire, the Doctor was sleeping in an arm-chair by the window, and John Clifford stood alone by the bedside of his adopted son. He had never dreamed until this sickness, how dear a place that son held in his heart. His love for Juno had never yet outgrown the passionate romance of long ago. She was still his idol. Compared with her all the rest of earth was valueless as an egg-shell. But outside that charmed circle of which she was the sun and the centre, no one had so warm a nook in his heart as Warren. He was very proud of the young man, and perhaps this strengthened his attachment. He leaned over the bedside with anxiety which surprised even himself. And as he watched, Warren slowly unclosed his eyes. It needed but a single glance, to see that he was delirious no longer. But he evidently realized nothing of the Past. He seemed awaking from some troubled dream. "Father," he said,' anxiously, "you will not bid me give her up?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Her,</emph> my son! whom do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Grace! my promised bride, Grace Atherton. Surely I have told you before?"</p>
               <p>"No, you have said nothing about it."</p>
               <p>"You will love her, I'm sure you will; and, father,"—Mr. Clifford bent his head lower to catch the whisper which was becoming more and more faint—"please don't tell mother yet!"</p>
               <p>"No, no, I will leave it for you to tell her yourself, my boy."</p>
               <p>The assurance seemed to satisfy him, and he closed his eyes and sank into a quiet slumber. The next morning he awoke calm and refreshed, but very weak still. "The danger is passed," said the physician in a tone of calm assurance. Juno was leaning over the bedside. She bent down and pressed her lips impetuously to his brow, whispering so low that<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7298-00000076"/> no one else could hear it—"Thank God! I had well-nigh been once more alone."</p>
               <p>It was several days before he had strength enough for conversation. During this time, except for a few hours at night, Juno never left him. He could only let his hand lie quietly in hers, and reward her by an occasional smile, or a low word of thanks, but she was satisfied.</p>
               <p>"Mother," he said as she entered his room, on the morning of the fifth day, "I want you to do something for me this morning. It is nearly three weeks, is it not, since I was first taken sick?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear, nearly."</p>
               <p>"And there has been such an anxious heart all this time. There is one who ought to have known long ago. Will you write a letter for me this morning? I had rather you should write it than to delegate the office to Jane."</p>
               <p>"To Mr. Douglas, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"No, mother, to Miss Atherton. I am betrothed, my mother!"</p>
               <p>A quick cry burst from Juno's pallid lips, and she sank senseless upon the floor. Warren pulled the bell till the string broke. He was not yet strong enough to lift her in his arms, but he raised her head, and supported it tenderly. In an instant the quadroon entered. She glanced around the room, and then looked in his face, with the keen gaze peculiar to her, before advancing to her mistress. Then quietly coming to her side, she sprinkled her assiduously with eau de cologne, and held a vinaigrette to her nostrils. In a few moments she was perfectly recovered. The first thought of her returning consciousness, was a fear lest Warren should have understood the cause of her emotion. She sat down in a chair by the writing-table as quietly as if nothing had occurred. "I hope you were not alarmed, dear Warren," she said in a cheerful tone. "These fainting turns are quite common with me, especially of late, since I have been so exhausted with anxiety. Don't talk about it, please, I don't want to fancy myself sick. I feel quite well now, and you shall tell me all about this new daughter you wish to give me." The story was quickly recounted, he concealed nothing, not even the episode with Miss Hargrave; and his voice grew low and thrilling in its tenderness, as he lingered over the last evening he had spent with Grace, and repeated his promise of visiting her in three weeks, and writing in the mean time. "Poor Grace!" he said, "how she must have suffered; and oh, mother, she loves me so!"</p>
               <p>Juno sat in silence for a few moments, her head bowed upon her hand. The tidings she had heard, while they stung her soul with grief, only served to arouse at once all the craft, and all the energy of her strange character. "Should she give him up?" she<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7298-00000077"/> asked herself, "him, whom it had been the sole labor of years to secure—the only one her proud heart had ever loved? Must she see another happy in his caresses? Should she doom herself to a long, hopeless life of misery and loneliness, for the sake of this young girl, this interfering stranger, who did not, could not, love him as she did? Was he not hers, her own? Had she not taken him from poverty, cared for him in health, and nursed him in sickness, and was she to lose her reward? John Clifford's hair was every day growing grayer, and she,"—she raised her head and looked into the mirror—"she grew younger, it almost seemed; and fairer still, if that were possible—he might be all her own yet; he <emph>must.</emph> But how?" This was the question. She saw that he loved this young girl. She had studied his character fully. She knew that if she openly opposed his passion, she would lose all hope of attracting him to herself. He must not fathom her motives. He must never see her otherwise than kind, unselfish, generous, sympathizing. For the present, she must be his mother, and trust to the future for the establishment of a dearer tie. She would separate them; aye, on that she was resolved, even if it broke the young girl's heart, who had dared to come between them. But it must be done skilfully; John Clifford should bear the blame. She would write the letter since he had asked it, at whatever cost of suffering to herself. "Courage, Juno," she said under her breath, "and now, if ever, oh Satan, help me!"</p>
               <p>Then she turned toward Warren, a face half mournful, half lighted by a serene smile. "I had not thought so soon to lose my home-boy, my pet; but I must not forget that you are twenty-two, now, and I cannot expect to keep you always. I must win this dear Grace to love me, can I not?"</p>
               <p>"She does already, sweetest mother, else she would have no love of mine. And so you will write the letter? How can I thank you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, be a good boy, and not let this, or any thing else worry you. Just get well as fast as you can." She drew a desk toward her, and supplied herself with a sheet of delicate Paris note-paper.</p>
               <p>Warren smiled—"That's a little sheet, mamma mine, for a lover's letter; however, I'll have mercy upon you, and make it just as short as possible."</p>
               <p>"Well, what shall I say to begin with?"</p>
               <p>"Dearest Grace."</p>
               <p>"'Dearest,' and to <emph>her!</emph>" thought Juno, bitterly—"Where is his promise?" She bit her dainty lip, till it bled, but she quietly wrote the words. The letter he dictated was quite a long one. It was a sort of history, detailing his illness, and the convalescence, cheered by his mother's tenderness, but rendered so sad by his anxiety lest she should suffer at his silence. Then it said—</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7298-00000078"/>
               <p>"Oh, if you were here, my own Grace, it would be so different. The days would never seem long, or weary, if I could watch their light and shade in your blue eyes. With your gentle hand in mine, I could bear cheerfully this weakness, so much worse than pain. Oh, how my heart cries out for you, like a tired child. Grace, Grace! There is some happiness in saying your name over to myself. Soon as I can, I shall come to you. I am getting stronger every day. I will be well enough to travel very soon. Even now I sit up most of the time. I am longing to sit beside you, to hold your hand in mine, to hear you tell me once more that I am your dearest, and to thank God for the precious gift, of which I am not worthy.</p>
               <p>"My mother is writing this, sweetest Grace. Knowing how I have always trusted her, you cannot wonder that I am willing now her eyes should behold the utterance of my heart's deepest and holiest feelings. Perhaps I am strong enough to have written it myself, but it would have tired me very much; and now that I have a sweet Grace for whose sake to 'be careful, I am a very niggard of my strength, in my impatience to be once more with her. Write to me. The sight of your sweet little Italian characters will be 'guid for sair een.' You will write quickly, will you not? Judge from your own heart, how anxious I must be. There, my beloved, I am going "to sign this letter with my own hand."</p>
               <p>Juno wrote all this, with her face turned away, that he might not note its changes. It was a strange sight to see that haughty woman, with her fair brow knitted in a fierce frown, biting her lips with her small, white teeth, and writing with trembling hand, and throbbing bosom, these words of tenderness to another, from him, of whom her soul had made to itself an idol. But she completed her task, and then clearing her brow, turned to Warren, and held out the pen with a smile. He wrote "Warren Clifford" in a bold, distinct hand.</p>
               <p>"That reminds me," she remarked, carelessly, as she folded the letter, that Mr. Clifford has never legally adopted you. We were speaking of it the other day. This carelessness in neglecting it so long, is really unpardonable. But we don't like to do it now. It has passed along for such a while, almost every one thinks you are really our own by birth, and we are too proud of you to be willing to undeceive them. So Mr. Clifford thought of adjusting every thing by a will. Glenthorne, I think you said; Miss Grace Atherton, Glenthorne?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is right, kindest mother."</p>
               <p>"Nay, love, you should keep all the superlatives now for Grace.—What! there comes Mr. Clifford. I thought you went to the city two hours ago!"</p>
               <p>"So I did, but I came back for some papers I had forgotten. I have seen Dr. Greene this morning.<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7298-00000079"/> He wants you and Warren to set out immediately for Saratoga. You can take our own horses and servants. Could you start by Monday? He says the journey, by easy stages, will do Warren good; and his report has made me quite anxious about you both."</p>
               <p>Juno stood a moment in a thoughtful attitude. She did not think it necessary to say that this very disinterested medical advice had originated in a suggestion of her own. She replied, after an instant, in a tone of decision—"It will be somewhat difficult, but I will promise to be ready. Of course if Warren needs change of air, that must be our first consideration. You will go with us?"</p>
               <p>"No, it is impossible for me to leave quite yet, but I'll follow you by public conveyance within the week. Shall I take your letter to town? I see you have one ready?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I suppose you had best. It is Warren's."</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifford left the room, and Juno said, lovingly—"Now I shall soon see you looking better, my poor boy."</p>
               <p>"But it hardly seems right to go to Saratoga, until I have been to Glenthorne."</p>
               <p>"Go to Saratoga, that you may be able to go to Glenthorne. The answer to your letter can be sent after us. It will do you so much good, and I feel the need of it myself."</p>
               <p>Warren thought of the fainting-turn. "No wonder, you have worn yourself out watching me. I ought to be only too glad to go any where, where you can get back your strength again."</p>

               <head>XI. EMMIE HEREFORD WRITES A LETTER.</head>
               <p>"I HAVE news for you, Dick Hereford," cried Simon Goldthwaite, flinging open the door of the room which for nearly four years he had shared with his young companion. Dick looked up with a cheerful smile—"Well, what now?"</p>
               <p>"It seems your hopeful brother Warren received the valedictory appointment at Yale Commencement, a month ago, nearly."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am so glad. I am sure he deserves it. My mother always felt that he was a genius."</p>
               <p>"Glad! Don't you remember the shameful manner he treated you, four years ago?"</p>
               <p>A flush passed over Dick Hereford's face. "Yes, I remember our last meeting perfectly, but I know he was trying to do right, and I can never love him less for an act like that. Thank you for telling me of his success; and now, I've something <emph>you</emph> will like to hear;—a letter from our little Emmie."</p>
               <p>A close observer could have seen the quick glance of delight that' kindled up the light-blue eye, which shone with all the gentleness of a woman's from underneath Simon's shaggy lashes. He seated himself in a listening attitude, and remarked, in a tone of suppressed interest, "Well, well, why don't you go on with the letter? You say they are my sisters also."</p>
               <p>It was a clear, delicate little hand, Simon could see that, as Dick held it up between him and the candle. Miss Emmie was seventeen now, and there was about every thing which bore the impress of her womanly fingers, a kind of young-ladylike grace and propriety, which was very pretty. Dick unfolded it and read:</p>

                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"DEAREST BROTHER:—It is not my turn to write, but I have been thinking of you so earnestly to-day, that I've resolved, at last, to make a thought-bridge of my little steel pen, and tell you about my reveries. In the first place, though, you ought to see where I am writing. Yes, you ought to see Mohawk Village now. The dear, blue river glides along so gently between its fringed banks, and the sweet green islets lie, like summer children, in such a peaceful sleep upon its breast. The willow trees, 'always genteel,' are bending over its waves, bowing to their own shadows, and all the green things round look as if they were rejoicing in the fresh air and the sunshine. But I will tell you what is the prettiest sight which meets my<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7298-00000081"/> eye. It is a gnarled old oak, very large, and very strong, round which climbs a perfect wealth of the beautiful ivy. They are living things, I know; and it takes all mamma's logic to persuade me that they cannot think and feel. They always seemed to me to have a history, nay more, a romance linked with their two lives. The oak looks like some veteran soldier. His life is not yet quite past its prime, but he has grown old among the crash of contending armies, and the fierce shocks of battles. He is scarred, and battered, and now round this glorious ruin the ivy clings, young, fresh, trusting, and so beautiful; laying her long green fingers on his seamed and furrowed front, hiding his roughness with the embrace of her tender arms. Looking from my window, summer and winter I see them, my beautiful emblems of strength and truth. I wish sometimes, in a large charity, that all the world could look upon them as I do, that they could teach every one the same lesson.</p>
                           <p>"Surely tourists need no longer say, America lacks the grandeur and beauty of ruins; unless, indeed, the handiwork of God be less note-worthy than the works of man— <q>
                                 <l>'Fragments of stone reared by creatures of clay.'</l>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>"There, I know just how you are looking. You are laughing, and crying, 'Bravo! my silly little Emmie a philosopher!' but it's not me, only the influence fluence of the scene around me. And I have not told you all that my eyes behold. No words could ever paint the serene glory of this summer sky—this clear, deep, untroubled blue, with a white cloud sailing slowly over, here and there, like the phantom ships we used to read about in the long evenings, in those old German tales. Then there are such sunny fields, such green hills, where the sunshine swoons away in its great blessedness, and goes to sleep; and, there is Mabel. Oh, Dick! is she not heaven-sent and an angel? I never can look at her, without feeling all sinful thoughts melt away in the charmed atmosphere of her purity. She seems so unconscious of her affliction. Sometimes I think she is happier than any of us. She whose outward eyes take in no sight of nature, yet gazes inwardly on such beatific visions. She tells us sometimes of the 'Pleasure-land' wherein her thoughts go roving, where there are thornlessflowers, and such bright-winged birds sing for ever. The hills are soft and sunny, and the skies blue as those of a poet's vision, and hither our Mabel wanders, needing no guiding hand.</p>
                           <p>"She is sitting now just within view, as I raise my eyes from this sheet. She is all in white, and nothing else could possibly be so appropriate. Her little straw hat lies on the grass beside her; the sunshine is sifting down through the beeches upon her golden tresses; her small, thin hands are clasped, and her<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7298-00000082"/> earnest yet sightless eyes are wide open, looking toward the sunshine. You would think the Wonder-land whither they are gazing, must be heaven. Oh, Dick, you know I never loved poetry, and yet I have thought of late, that Mabel's whole life was a poem, and I like it because it doesn't quite rhyme. I believe there are a great many true, sweet poets I would like, if, like Mabel, they didn't rhyme, but I can't fancy that ugly 'stop short' at the end of every line.</p>
                           <p>"But I haven't quite finished my picture. You know just how it looks <emph>inside</emph>—this pleasant old sitting-room, with its bay-windows, the bookcase, the round table, the guitar, and your own especial nook, just as you left it, with your writing-desk, and your drawing-case. Then there is dear mamma, with her sweet, pensive face, sitting just as you have seen her a hundred times, at her little work-stand. She has on a new black dress, the one you sent her, and the widow's cap she wears is prettier, to my fancy, than of old, because I made it.</p>
                           <p>"The rest of the family are scattered around. Pussy has irreverently taken possession of Master Dick Hereford's own chair, and our glorious old Newfoundland, Bruno, is deliberately crossing the fields in the direction of Mabel. Then, there are my own especial pets—my plantation, I call them—the geese, and ducks, and turkeys, to say nothing of the dear little chickens that are lifting up their heads at every mouthful, in a kind of meek thankfulness. I have much happiness in them all, especially the chickens. The peacocks offend my taste a little by their absurd pride, and then there are flirtations, each one with the wife of his neighbor, which I don't quite like; but on the whole, they are a very well-behaved plantation. They are just the things one needs here. I do believe I am a born-housewife. I can feel for a time the quiet, poetic beauty around me most intensely, but I should get weary, without the life that only living things can impart to the landscape.</p>
                           <p>"There, I have written more about this than I meant. I only hope it will help to make you home-sick, for we want to see you here more than even you can guess, Yankee as you boast that you are getting to be.</p>
                           <p>"Did I tell you, away back there at the beginning of my letter, that I had been thinking of you to-day? And not of you only, but I have been going back over ten years of life. Did you think I could remember so long? Do you know how I used to sit and sing harvest-carols, in all the desolation of that tumbledown house in Eliot street, and you and Warren used to get vexed sometimes with silly little Emmie and her noise, to think I could have a hopeful heart in the midst of that freezing poverty? Mother was so sick then, and every thing was so gloomy, I have wondered since that my spirits could have been so light. But<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7298-00000083"/> I was only seven, and to my disposition, I do believe troubles always seem lighter that they do to others. They may talk all the wisdom they please, about sun, moon, and planets, <emph>I</emph> hold that <emph>hope</emph> is the true sunshine of life, and without it, the best day in all the summer would be dark as the winter midnight of an Esquimaux. It is true, I sung harvest-carols a long time, and no relief came. The fireless hearth grew colder and colder, and the garments thinner, which wrapped us from the chill. What of that? The deliverance is promised to those who <emph>wait.</emph> Our turn came after a while. Oh what a light it made in that old gloomy house, when the beautiful lady entered with her rich robes; and after that, there was no more darkness, nor cold, nor hunger. Do you remember now we clapped our hands and rejoiced, when we came in sight of this dear home? How the river sparkled in the sunshine, and the little cottage, overgrown with honeysuckles and climbing roses, looked such a loving welcome, and how our Mabel lifted up her fringed eyelids, and said, in her low, gentle voice—'Are we part way to Heaven, mother?' Then there was the pleasure of settling every thing, and making it beautiful; and dear mamma grew better every day, until she was quite well. I have been thinking of all these things this morning. They came to me like a sermon, and what do you suppose was the text? Nothing else than a passage in your last letter, where you write of the old bitterness, that meeting with brother Warren in Broadway, nearly four years ago. Dick, you were wrong, it seems to me, in blaming him even 'a little.' Through him and the mother of his adoption, came all the blessings we enjoy. But for them, we should never have known even the good physician who introduced you to your employers. And shall we complain, because Warren felt bound, in honor, to observe to the letter the conditions on which we receive all these benefits? Such a feeling is not quite worthy of you, brother Dick. The time may come when Warren will be free once more to stand in our midst, and if it does, I feel we shall never have cause to blush for our brother.</p>
                           <p>"Every one sends love to you, at least mother does, and before Mabel went out of doors, I asked her what I should say for her, and she said, 'Tell him to come home when he can;' and she added, with the tear-drops just glistening in those dear eyes, 'any place would be nice, where Dick is—where he could come home every evening. Don't you think he will let us come and live near him, when he gets real rich, Emmie?'</p>
                           <p>"Of course I knew well enough, in the plenitude of my practical wisdom, how far off such a time must be, but I did not like to pain her; so I told her you had very often promised this, and you were too good a<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7298-00000084"/> brother to disappoint us. There, Diet, you must give me credit for good intentions. I did not mean to persecute you with such a long letter, but I fancy my best excuse is the very old one, 'it wrote itself.' You will remember, to the kind friend and room-mate you so often mention, the kind regards of</p>

               <p>Dick folded the precious document with an audible sigh. Then smiling he said—" I am sure you must be quite out of patience. I had no idea the letter was so long, until I began to read it aloud. Poor little Emmie! Don't you think she has given me a sufficient reason for not being angry with Warren?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" Simon thoughtfully stroked his chin. "I tell you, Dick," he exclaimed after a moment, "you must never say silly little Emmie again; call her, rather, 'little Sunbeam,' for she has the sunniest character I ever heard of."</p>
               <p>"Yes, she is better than sunshine, truly. Why, Mr. Goldthwaite, who would have dreamed of your being so poetical? I shall write to Emmie, and tell her what you've named her, and we'll all call her so, as long as she deserves the title. Oh dear!"</p>
               <p>"What's that sigh for?"</p>
               <p>"Because I long so to have her here, to make sunshine among the brick walls. How I want to send for them, but, as Emmie says, it's a long way yet in the future. I cannot send till I'm well enough off to dispense with Juno Clifford's four hundred dollars; then we'll politely make our thankful leave-takings to the great lady. Heigho! that will be a proud day for me; I wish there was any reasonable hope of its coming before my hair turns gray."</p>
               <p>"What if you should send for them next spring?"</p>
               <p>"Next spring? Man alive! A salary of five hundred dollars a year. I couldn't do it. My mother and sisters must live respectably,"</p>
               <p>"What if it were doubled?"</p>
               <p>"I should send for them certainly, but no hope of that."</p>
               <p>"I don't know. I am paymaster, and, between ourselves, the head-bookkeeper gets fifteen hundred a year, and his assistants are better off than you are. One of them is going to leave."</p>
               <p>"What, Ezekiel Sharpe?"</p>
               <p>"No such good news. That quiet, accommodating Seldon, and the firm intend you shall take his place. We will see, New-Year's day, what a lift that will give you. You must introduce me to little Sunbeam, if she conies to the city."</p>
               <p>"Of course. Aren't you going to send some reply to her message?"</p>
               <p>"It's not worth while to impose upon her kindness. She couldn't like me, if she once saw me, even<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7298-00000085"/> as your friend. Her fancies about the oak and the ivy were very sweet, but I am the scarred and battered oak, with no green ivy to twine about the ruin, and she would see me in all the deformity of my ugliness."</p>
               <p>He turned abruptly and left the room as he ceased speaking, and Dick sat down with a sigh and a smile, to give an account of the evening's conversation to his pet sister Emmie.</p>

               <head>XII. THE PARENTS' BLESSING.</head>
               <p>JUNO CLIFFORD had allowed herself but one day for shopping in New York, on her way to Saratoga. Her first purchases were made at the very establishment where Dick was employed. Leaving her carriage, she swept into the store with the step of a princess. Even in this <foreign xml:lang="ARA">bazaar</foreign> of the costly and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">recherché,</foreign> twenty pair of eyes were turned in wonder, no less at the empress-like magnificence of her robes, than at her own superb beauty.</p>
               <p>Her purchases were a camel's-hair shawl, that might have set half Up-Town crazy with envy, a veil of costliest Honiton, and a scarf, light and delicate as the meshes of a spider's web. Her shopping was by no means attended with the usual fashionable amount of dawdling and uncertainty. Here, as in every thing else, was made manifest her imperious will. Utterly regardless of such minor considerations as dollars and cents, every article sufficiently unique and costly to attract her attention, was immediately transferred to her own possession. Warren, who had been standing<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7298-00000086"/> at a little distance, joined her when she left the shop, and extended his hand to assist her as she stepped into the carriage. It was cold as ice. For a moment the coachman stood awaiting her orders. "Up Broadway," she said at length; the door was shut, and the carriage rolled on. There was a strange glitter in Warren's eyes, and his face was deathly white. She sat waiting for him to break the silence. Her hands lay carelessly clasped upon her lap, her attitude was graceful and composed as ever, but there was a look of intense anxiety in her eyes half veiled by the long lashes which drooped over them. When at length he spoke his voice was very husky with suppressed emotion.</p>
               <p>"Mother," he said, "it is the second time! did you see him?"</p>
               <p>"Him! see who, Warren, dearest?"</p>
               <p>"I forgot. You never saw him before, and you could not know him. Mother, it was my brother Dick, of whom you bought that scarf. I did not speak to him, because I would not without your permission, but I must go back. May I get out of the carriage?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Warren, if you <emph>must,</emph> but wait one moment."</p>
               <p>Without and within! strange difference!</p>
               <p>Without! Broadway was full of tumultuous, hurried, bustling life. The shop windows were hung with bright and costly fabrics. Men hurried down the street with that peculiar air of life and death importance which distinguishes New York from every other city on the globe. Crowds of elegantly dressed ladies swept along the side-walks, and many a bright eye glanced up, from the throng of busy idlers, toward the stylish equipage, with its magnificent milk-white horses and self-satisfied black coachman, with a half sigh at the imaginary happiness of the occupants.</p>
               <p>Within! Juno Clifford's hands were tightly clasped; spasms of agony convulsed her features, and crouching down at Warren's feet, she murmured passionately—"Oh, Warren, Warren! can you not give <emph>them</emph> up for me? Was it not enough that the sweet face of a young, happy girl has won your heart away from me, who so love you; must you deprive me of what still remains, and go back with it to those friends of your babyhood? Have they not others to love? Would they care for you as I have done these many years?</p>
               <p>"But never mind! I have sacrificed much for your sake, I can bear more still. Go! my prayers and my tears shall be no restraint. Go back, and make yourself known to your brother. Tear yourself away from me altogether. Take away the love which has been the one hope of my life, and then, perhaps, God will be merciful, and let me die. Go! Why do you not leave me?"</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7298-00000087"/>
               <p>"Because I <emph>will</emph> not," and he raised her up, and supported her in his arms. "Have I not sworn you should be dearest of all? I will never leave nor forsake you. If it would pain you so to have me seek my brother, I will remember the conditions on Which I came to you, and fulfil them. Not for their sake indeed, but because I will not grieve you, my own beautiful mother, you who have the highest claim on both my love and obedience."</p>
               <p>Soothed by his words, and still more by the embrace in which he held her, at once respectful, protecting and fond, she smiled in reply, and permitted herself to be consoled. Her glorious eyes flashed sunshine on him through her tears, her cheeks flushed crimson beneath the heavy bands of her jetty hair, and once more gazing on her beauty, the adopted son forgot all but Juno Clifford.</p>
               <p>Rooms had been engaged at the United States Hotel a week before, and two or three of Juno's servants had been there several days in advance, so that she was met at the door by her own people. There were a crowd of idlers lounging about the entrance, but their eager glances met little to satisfy their curiosity. Juno gathered up the folds of her costly travelling dress, with the tiny fingers of one daintily gloved hand, then resting the other on Warren's extended arm, she passed haughtily into the house. The heavily wrought black lace veil swept downward almost to her feet, and the by-standers could only guess that she was beautiful, by the exquisite grace of her every movement, and the brilliant eyes, whose flashing even the thick folds of her veil could not obscure.</p>
               <p>"By Jove!" cried one of the loungers to his companion, "she is the most magnificent creature we have had in Saratoga this summer—a perfect goddess, a <emph>Juno!</emph>"</p>
               <p>His friend smiled—" Well done, Max, you have guessed her name—hit the mark exactly."</p>
               <p>"Her name? What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, only those milk-white horses, which that grinning rascal of a black coachman is driving off to the stables, are the property of John Clifford, Esq., of Clifford Hall near Boston, and the lady is Mrs. John Clifford, Juno Stanley that was."</p>
               <p>"How in the world do you know every one?"</p>
               <p>The self-satisfied exquisite stroked, complacently, his perfumed moustache, and answered, with an air of fashionable indifference,—"Well, I flatter myself I know most people one cares to know. I have no doubt you will see Mrs. Clifford at dinner, and you'll admit that her eyes are not easily to be forgotten. I never saw her but twice, and once was in her girlhood. She was of a Southern family, haughty as Lucifer<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7298-00000088"/> himself. But somehow she was left poor, and she married this John Clifford."</p>
               <p>"Well, what of him?"</p>
               <p>"O he's Mrs. Clifford's husband; quiet, gentleman-like, and twenty years older than herself. I've seen them once together, and one thing I know—she doesn't love him."</p>
               <p>"Ha, say you so? Then the Hon. Max Greene, M. C. from Georgia, is at her service for a flirtation."</p>
               <p>"No use, Max, you can't do it. Why, the lady was for three years at Paris, and every one pronounced her the most beautiful woman who appeared at Court. Half the men in the realm were at her feet, and she came back, without having given a look of encouragement to one of them."</p>
               <p>"Has the woman no vanity?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is, she knows she is beautiful. She has been accustomed to homage, and she likes it."</p>
               <p>"That's it. I know my ground now. Probably her Parisian cavaliers were too devoted. You can watch the game, Fred, I am secure of my flirtation. There are a few days left of August, and I shall stay until the middle of September."</p>
               <p>But the Hon. Max Greene was doomed to a most inglorious defeat. Juno came down to dinner, calm and queenly as ever, leaning on Warren's arm, and followed by her own servant. He secured the honor of an introduction, and then commenced his contem plated siege, by a display of the most studied neglect and indifference. But the lady seemed entirely unconscious of his presence. If he condemned the air she was playing, loudly enough to be heard by half the room, she would finish it with a pride careless yet firm, overtopping and conquering his own. She found many friends at Saratoga, but she visibly sought no society but Warren's. Gradually the M. C.'smanners veered from neglect to the most assiduous attention, but he was equally unsuccessful. While he was standing by her side, or bending over her chair, the lady, entirely oblivious of his presence, would summon her son, or beckon to her quadroon shadow, for the clasping of a bracelet upon her arm, or the adjustment of a shawl. The evening of the third day, she was sitting at an open window, somewhat retired from the gay groups thronging the spacious parlor. Her eyes were bent upon the carpet, where a single moon-ray was struggling to make itself seen, among the glow of the lamp-light. The quadroon had just entered with a cashmere scarf, which she was folding about her shoulders, when Mr. Greene approached. "Is not the evening lovely, Mrs. Clifford?"</p>
               <p>The lady very slightly raised her drooping lashes—"Jane," she said, as if the exertion of speaking wearied her, "you can look out, and tell the gentleman what kind of an evening it is!"</p>
               <p>Her manner was a ludicrous caricature of the<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7298-00000089"/> gentleman's own deportment toward his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">valet.</foreign> As if totally unconscious of this, however, Juno drew the scarf more closely around her, and going back to her reverie, cast the long lashes downward over the lustrous eyes, once more seeking the carpet. There was a smile of suppressed mirth on every face, which' met the eyes of the despairing Georgian. Acutely sensitive to ridicule, he left the room, and gave orders that all things should be in readiness for his departure the next morning. In spite of the neglectful, half indolent, half contemptuous style of Mrs. Clifford's manners, these three days had already sufficed to make her the star of Saratoga. Warren enjoyed this intensely. He had prided himself on her rare beauty for many years, and it was matter of undisguised triumph to find it so readily acknowledged by the galaxy of wealth and fashion assembled at what somebody has called—"the great market-place of marriageable women."</p>
               <p>The next morning John Clifford made his appearance. It was nearly mid-day, and very warm. His lady lay upon a lounge in her own room, Warren was reading aloud, and the quadroon knelt upon a cushion beside her, waving to and fro a large fan, made from the plumage of the African ostrich.</p>
               <p>Warren paused, and Juno lifted her eyes as he entered, but she did not spring from her lounge to meet him; so he came quietly forward, and bending over her, pressed his lips to her brow. "Please don't, I am not very well," she said, faintly. He rose with a half sigh, and extended his hand to Warren. "And there's something <emph>you</emph> will be glad to get." He smiled, as he handed Warren a delicate-looking little letter, a perfect snow-drop of an affair, with its pure white envelope, its faint yet graceful superscription, and the single drop of bright ruby-colored wax which sealed it. Warren eagerly opened it, and Juno watched him while he read. The color came and went in his face, his eyes sparkled at first, but before he finished they were dim with tears. He pressed it passionately to his lips, and then folded it and placed it in his bosom. "Poor little Grace!" he said, tenderly—"she has been so anxious about me. I know she has worried herself ill. There is such a tone of sadness all through her letter. I must start for Glenthorne this very noon. Even then I cannot reach there till to-morrow night. You are willing, are you not, father? Now you have come, my mother will not need me any longer."</p>
               <p>"Yes, oh yes," was the reply. "Go as fast as ever you please, only don't let us have you getting sick again."</p>
               <p>Juno frowned, but she bit her lip, and strove to force back her features to their habitual calmness. "Father"—Warren's tone was very earnest—"I go to ask from her parents the hand of my betrothed. Can<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7298-00000090"/> I say, <emph>may</emph> I say, that you have consented, that you will welcome her by and by to your own fireside?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>No!</emph>" Juno's quick whisper was almost passionate in its earnestness. It reached only her husband's ear, but it regulated his answer—"No, Warren, I should hardly like you to say that until I have seen the young lady. It is not necessary as yet. We will wait a little." His tone was kind but firm, and Warren left the room in silence to make arrangements for his journey. In half an hour he re-entered. Mr. Clifford had gone out to visit the stables, Juno had despatched the quadroon on a brief errand, and she was alone. Warren knelt down beside her, and turned her face tenderly toward him. The long lashes were glittering with tears, which he silently kissed away. "I am ill," she murmured, "very ill. I am going to start for home to-morrow. I shall not like this place when you will be here no longer; beside, I am not strong enough to stay."</p>
               <p>For a moment Warren's heart reproached him, but the pale, sweet face of his anxious, suffering Grace rose up before him, and clasping her to his heart in a tender farewell, he went out. He met Mr. Clifford, and bade him a hurried good-bye upon the stairs, and in five minutes stepped on board the next train for Albany.</p>
               <p>He reached Glenthorne the evening of the next day. It was the last night of the summer. Already the moon was rising, fair, and sweet, and tremulous as a young bride. His coming was entirely unlooked-for, and Grace had wandered forth to inhale the fragrant breath of the dying summer. Warren left his portmanteau at the hotel, and walked toward the cottage. His heart beat tumultuously, as he caught the outline of her graceful figure, the gleam of her white robe. He came silently toward her, and clasped her suddenly in his arms. She strove to break from the embrace in which he held her, but he only drew her more fondly to his heart, and bending over her whispered—" My own Grace, my betrothed wife!" There were no more struggles then-the golden head lay at rest in the shelter of his bosom. He was wise as he was kind, and he let her weep till her timid, fluttering heart beat more quietly against his side. "You are so good not to scold me for crying," she said, with childlike simplicity, looking up at length, and smiling through her tears.</p>
               <p>"Scold you; as if I <emph>could</emph> scold you, Grace! Nay, love, those blue eyes may weep at their own sweet. will, if you will shed all the tears upon my breast."</p>
               <p>"Shure, ma'am," said Irish Katy, next morning, "the candles in those long sticks in the parlor are burnt down to just nothing at all. You can see for yoursel." Mrs. Atherton smiled, but there was a heavy weight in her heart, at the thought of the young wooer who was to bear away her treasure.<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7298-00000091"/> Three had the grave taken, and now this youngest and fairest one of all, this nursling of her old age, was to go forth to make life and light beside the hearth-stone of another.</p>
               <p>The week which Warren spent at Glenthorne passed rapidly away. There were dear old scenes to be traversed over and over again, old books to be searched for the passages they had marked years before, and then, the haying time was not yet over. Grace's simple, light-hearted gayety was infectious, and Warren found the grave dignity of the successful graduate rapidly disappearing. He even confessed that a hay cart, piled high with its fragrant load, was a great deal merrier, if a slightly less elegant vehicle than his mother's carriage, with its sumptuous cushions of Genoa velvet. Then it was so nice to lie and dream, under the spreading trees, never tiring of his companion; asking over and over again the same questions, and listening over and over again to the same low murmured replies. "Ah, Gracie, I do believe I could be happy in Glenthorne for ever," he whispered, as they entered the post-office, the usual termination to their sunset walk.</p>
               <p>The letter which was placed in his hand, was directed in the bold, somewhat heavy chirography of his father. It contained a request that he would hasten home, and go to Washington immediately upon important business. The summons could not be set aside, but Warren left the office with a heavy heart.</p>
               <p>The next day Warren stood before Mr. Atherton, with a mien as bashful as a boy. He had meant to say some very nice things. Indeed he had arranged the heads of quite a discourse in his mind. There was a good deal about unworthiness, dutiful submission, blessing of parents, and so on, but somehow it all vanished, when he came in sight of the benevolent-looking old gentleman, in his home-made easy chair. He could only stammer forth very confusedly—"I love your daughter Grace, Mr. Atherton; could you trust her happiness to my keeping?"</p>
               <p>The old gentleman took off his spectacles, wiped them, and deliberately put them on again. Then looking Warren in the face, he inquired, "Well, sir, when do you want to get married?" Warren was not ready with an answer to this question, and something very like a blush passed over his face.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman evidently pitied his embarrassment, for he said, with a kindly smile—"I believe I am very glad, young man, that you are not prepared to answer my question. The longer we can keep our little Grace, at home, the happier it'll be for us—won't it, wife? "Mrs. Atherton's calm womanly face smiled a reply from the arm-chair over opposite, and he went on with another question—"Does my little girl love you?"</p>
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7298-00000092"/>
               <p>"She has told me so, dear sir."</p>
               <p>"Mary, go and bring her here."</p>
               <p>The gentle mother reappeared in a moment, with the child of her old age by her side. The father held out his hand tenderly: "Come here, Mistress Grace, and tell me if this be true, that you want to go away and leave your old father and mother?"</p>
               <p>"Please don't, dear father," was all that she could trust herself to say, but there was a sufficient answer in the look the blue eyes turned on Warren. The young man was bold enough now. He drew nearer, and took her hand in his own, and there was the eloquence of deep and fervid feeling in the words which told how dear and beautiful he thought her, how tenderly he would guard her happiness. The father's eye grew dim. "Come here, mother," he said earnestly—"eome here, and say if you are willing to give your nursling to this suitor's care."</p>
               <p>The mother read the deep love in the sweet girl's eloquent eyes, and the truth and honor in the eager face bending over her, and she bowed her head, and answered, "I am willing."</p>
               <p>"She is the last of four," said the old man's husky tones. "We shall go hence very soon, where they have gone before us. Deal gently with the child, when our heads are lying low in the churchyard."</p>
               <p>"<emph>I will;</emph> behold, my father, she trusts me." There was a deep and fervent resolve in Warren Clifford's tone, and he sank on his knees before her father's chair, with the young girl still in his arms, and the trembling hands of old Russel Atherton were laid in benediction upon those two bowed heads.</p>

               <head>XIII. JUNO CLIFFORD GOES A VISITING.</head>
               <p>WE are told in the beginning of Virgil, (don't be shocked, gentle lady reader, I mean Pope's Virgil; I am a woman, and I know the proprieties,)—in the first book of Pope's Virgil then, we are told how in olden times on an errand of mischief, the goddess Juno went a-visiting, I don't mean to assert that this very ancient example had any effect on our lady, Juno Clifford; and indeed, the errand of persuading the good king Æolus to "strike force into his winds," and scatter abroad the ships of the pious Æneas, was certainly far enough removed from Juno Clifford's peaceable design of making her appearance at Glenthorne Cottage. She had detained Warren for more than a week at home, before permitting him to set off for Washington, where he had business which could not fail to occupy him a month longer. He had already been absent more than two weeks, when she entered her husband's study on the first morning in October. Mr. Clifford was looking over some papers, but he laid them aside with a happy smile, at this unusual interruption. "What have you there?" she said, carelessly.</p>
               <p>"Only my will," was the reply. "You know we were discussing the subject a long while ago, and decided that it was better to make a will, than to take measures to adopt Warren now; and yesterday I came to the conclusion that I had better not put off attending to it any longer."He opened it and laid it before her. The first bequest was a hundred thousand dollars to the adopted son, and then the rest of his immense fortune was bequeathed to his beloved wife, Juno Clifford. The lady was not satisfied. True, her own share was many times the largest; but years before, when they were first married, Mr. Clifford had made a will leaving <emph>her</emph> the sole and undisputed mistress of <emph>all,</emph> and she had hoped this would continue <emph>to the end,</emph> and Warren be left wholly dependent upon her bounty. She dared not give utterance to this feeling now. She pushed the paper from her with a smile.</p>
               <p>John Clifford rose, and going to an India cabinet in one corner of the room, deposited it therein.</p>
               <p>"There, Juno," he remarked, "you will know where to find it, if any thing should happen to me suddenly. You saw I had the same witnesses as in<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7298-00000094"/> the old will, made more than twenty years ago; by the by, that is in your possession?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will destroy it. Heaven send it may be many a year before <emph>any</emph> will be needed."</p>
               <p>Her husband thanked her with a look, and then she came, and stood over his chair, hanging her taper fingers idly upon his shoulder. He drew her hand across his wet eyes, and she said in the tone of a spoiled child, "Please, John, I want to go somewhere."</p>
               <p>"Well, my sweet wife."</p>
               <p>"And I want you to go too. It's to Glenthorne. I think if Warren was our own child, we wouldn't quite want him to get engaged, without seeing the lady-love and her parents. So it seems right to go. Then I want to go from there to New York and do some shopping. Can you spare so much time?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, twice as much, if you wished it. We will start to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Troth, ma'am, but it's the most beautiful lady," said Glenthorne Katy, returning from answering the door-bell.</p>
               <p>"Did she inquire for me, or for my mother?" asked Grace, hurriedly putting aside her work.</p>
               <p>"Yes, miss, she inquired for both of yees, av coorse, and such an ilegant chain at her waist, all the solid goold intirely, and a power of little things beside it, and a dress all flashing bright, with silver, and little glittering things in her ears; and what bates all the rest intirely, her beautiful eyes? so swate and yet looking as if she could kill you with them."</p>
               <p>"Quite a princess, according to your description, Katy."The mother and daughter were sewing, in Grace's own little room. The girl walked to the mirror, and twined her curls over her fingers in a little flutter of agitation. Then she turned to follow her mother down stairs. There was an air of simple yet perfect refinement about them both—the mother in her well preserved black silk, and snowy cap the daughter, looking, in her simple delaine dress buttoned close to the throat, with its wrought muslin collar, more elegant and really lady-like than half the brocade clad belles on Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Clifford had handed her card to our friend Katy, but printed bits of pasteboard were not much in vogue, in simple Glenthorne, and Katy very innocently put it in her bosom, to examine at her leisure, supposing it to be something designed for herself. But Grace had not only seen the lady's full-length portrait years before, but she had often noticed a very fine daguerreotype of his father and mother, which Warren accounted one of his chief treasures. She recognized Mrs. Clifford instantly, much to her own surprise, and went forward to shake hands. "You should not blush at<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7298-00000095"/> seeing <emph>his</emph> mother, my sweet Grace," was Juno's tender whisper, and looking full in her face with her dark, magnetic eyes, she bent forward and kissed her. There was a spell in that kiss to bind that young girl's heart more strongly than any words could have done. From that moment, Juno possessed much of that mysterious influence over her, which was all-powerful with Warren and her husband.</p>
               <p>"May I come to your room, dear Grace?" asked the lady that evening as they went up stairs; and long after John Clifford had been soundly sleeping, she sat there on the lounge, with her arm drawn around that young, innocent girl, whom in her heart she hated, oh how bitterly, discoursing of the absent son and lover. "There is his miniature,"she said kindly. "I brought it on purpose for you to see, as I believe you have none."At that moment Grace's timid heart was fluttering against a tiny little locket received from Washington but the day before, but she took the larger one which Juno handed her, and looked on the calm features pictured there, with a thrill of exquisite delight. Mrs. Clifford found her a much more formidable rival than she had anticipated. To even her worldly eyes, the singular purity of the girl's character was apparent. She realized that it was the very thing to retain the adoration of a mind like Warren's, and she bit her lip with vexation, that this simple country lassie could <emph>be,</emph> without an effort, the very thing which she had struggled for years to <emph>appear.</emph> Then Grace was beautiful; perhaps her jealous eyes even heightened the charm of the sweet, spiritual face, with its shading curls. Juno certainly acted her part skilfully. She talked as if Warren was dearer than her own life, and yet loving him as she did, she could feel the faults of his character most intensely, and she spoke of them sorrowfully to his betrothed, as to one who must know and feel them likewise. His want of firmness, she said, was worst of all. He had given up his early friends so very easily, that she sometimes feared lest it would be no sacrifice to part even with them, though they had done so much for him. Grace endeavored to defend him, but her tone was not very hopeful. Mrs. Clifford had reawakened an old and sorrowful fear of her own. That night, when at length Juno clasped her in her arms, and pressed a good-night kiss upon her lips, she threw herself on the bed, in an agony of tears. Her love was perfect, still, but much of her sweet trust was gone; she could no longer look fearlessly into the future, for a shadow walked beside her; the calm moonlight of cloudless faith was gone out, and the stars of her heart seemed far-off and cold and chill, like distant and deferred hopes. And yet she thought, amid her tears, how happy she ought to be, that Warren's mother had learned so easily to love<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7298-00000096"/> her, and would even sorrow for her sake, if <emph>he</emph> should prove cold and false.</p>
               <p>It had been settled, after very urgent entreaty on the part of Mrs. Clifford, that they should start for New York the next morning, taking Grace with them, and leaving her at Glenthorne on their return. It was the first time Grace had ever visited a city larger than New Haven, and in spite of the heaviness at her heart, the journey was matter of unqualified delight. Mrs. Clifford was so kind, that Grace ceased to wonder at the adoring tenderness with which she had inspired Warren. She could not quite sympathize, indeed, with Juno's raptures over star actresses and loves of dresses, but she was too much charmed with her peerless beauty, and too thoroughly subjugated by her kindness, to heed what seemed to her charitable judgment, very minor faults of character. She was quite prepared, on her return, to second Mrs. Clifford's earnest entreaty to her parents, that she should visit Boston early in December, and pass a few weeks at Mount Vernon street. Beside the rapturous thought of constant association with her betrothed, which sent the eloquent blood in tides to her cheek and brow, there was an untold wealth of anticipated delight in the companionship of Juno Clifford. It was a perpetual joy to look upon one so beautiful, and beside this glorious woman loved her. She had said so, drawing her head to her breast with motherly tenderness ness; said that she had never known the sweet companionship of mother and daughter; that even in her lonely girlhood, when she had seen some happier child lift her young face for a mother's yearning kiss, she had turned aside to weep. She had had no brother and no sister, not even a grave to which her heart could cling; and when she was a wife, no child had climbed her knee, no voice had called her mother, until God sent her Warren, and now a daughter had been given her also, a new claimant for her love; and at the words, the weeping girl nestled closer to her bosom, and Juno pressed kiss after kiss upon that innocent brow, hating her all the while, bitterly, bitterly.</p>
               <p>And then she left Glenthorne, and Grace followed her with the prayers and blessings of a loving spirit; and Mrs. Atherton sighed, bending wearily over her work, for, somehow, heavy upon her heart lay a presentiment of the ill which should befall her only child.</p>
               <p>The weeks passed rapidly over Glenthorne. Mother and daughter were busily engaged in preparation for the anticipated visit. New dresses were sent for and brought home, and the village dressmaker reported sundry somewhat extravagant stories of silks that would stand alone, and a white tarleton flounced from top to bottom.</p>
               <p>Meantime Warren's letters were frequent and affectionate as ever, each one containing some tender<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7298-00000097"/> message from Mrs. Clifford; and gradually the shadow passed quite away from Grace Atherton's loving heart, and even her mother looked forward with something like pleasurable anticipation to her darling's introduction into the enchanted atmosphere of Up-Town.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XIV. A LADY OF FASHION.</head>
               <p>IT was nearly twilight, on a cold December evening, when Grace stepped from the cars, with the feeling that she was at last in Boston. Her journey had been a somewhat fatiguing one, as the first part had been performed by stage. She had been indulging a secret hope that Warren would come to Glenthorne to bear her company. Of course she could not propose it, and there was really no need of such a course, as she was to travel under the protection of a worthy Glenthorne merchant, going to the city for his holiday goods. Warren had said nothing concerning it, but perhaps he meant to surprise her, and she had not quite given up the expectation until the very morning of her departure. She was scarcely aware herself how much bitterness this disappointment, added to the parting with the fond parents who folded her again and again in their loving arms.</p>
               <p>She had scarcely stepped from the cars, ere a well-known voice whispered—"My own, own Grace," and her hand trembled in the fervent clasp of her betrothed<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7298-00000098"/> trothed. "This way, Gracie, my mother is waiting for you in the carriage, and here, just give me your checks, and I'll look after your baggage." Juno's welcome was very cordial, much tenderer, it seemed to Grace's excited fancy, than Warren's had been, and she sank into her seat, with a perverse inclination to cry, which she bravely tried to conquer. She thought he might just have kissed her, when they hadn't met for months; but perhaps it wouldn't have been proper in the crowd, and she tried to listen to what Mrs. Clifford was saying about a certain Miss Sommers. "Yes," cried Warren, at that moment joining them, "mother insisted that she and I, to say nothing of father, were not enough to keep you from dying of the blues, so she has invited a companion for you, a young lady, to stay in the house, this Miss Sommers; but come, dear child, you have told me nothing of Glenthorne."</p>
               <p>Their conversation, during the drive home, was sadly constrained. It was very kind in Mrs. Clifford to meet her, and she reproached herself for the ingratitude of feeling a little grieved that Warren had not come alone; that she could not have him all to herself, for the first few moments. But then very likely Mrs. Clifford would not think that quite proper, and she had promised her parents to guard her watchfully as if she were her own; and Grace smiled a little at thinking how the knowledge of all their lonely walks, with only the moon and stars for watchers, would startle these strict notions of propriety. The carriage stopped, at last, before a stately mansion, whose door was instantaneously thrown open, and she felt Warren press her hand reassuringly, as she stepped out into the full glare of the gaslight. Mr. Clifford met her with a cordial welcome, and then Juno led her up stairs to her own room. "There, love," she said with another kiss, "I will leave you here now, while I dress for dinner. Your trunks will be brought up immediately, and when you want any assistance in dressing, you must ring."</p>
               <p>Grace managed to preserve her self-command until, her trunks were unstrapped, and she was left quite alone; then throwing herself down on the low French bed, she burst into a passion of tears. She paid no heed to the costly and elegant appointments of the room assigned her. Lace curtains heavily wrought draped the windows, a carpet of delicate and graceful pattern covered the floor, and a bright fire burning in the grate, flooded the rose-wood furniture with its genial glow, and bathed the marble madonnas holding up the chimney piece with a golden haze. The gaslight poured down its tempered brilliancy upon her head, and all around her was warmth and comfort and luxury; and yet she wept, with a sense of utter loneliness and desolation which had never before oppressed her.</p>
               <p>At length she roused herself and chided back her<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7298-00000099"/> tears. It was wrong, she said, it was ungrateful; every thing had been done for her comfort, and she had no cause for complaint. She must struggle against this weakness, or her lover would indeed have cause to blush for the simple country girl he had chosen. She rose, and commenced unfastening the loops of her travelling dress. Then she bathed her eyes, and arranged her disordered tresses, and threw open her trunks with a new feeling of anxiety. What should she put on? Mrs. Clifford was so elegant, and then there was the stranger too, to criticise the country girl's simple toilet. One after another she drew her dresses out upon the carpet. There were two or three very handsome silks, and the much talked of white tarleton, a blue crape, and a simple white muslin. She could not quite make up her mind to appear in any of them. It would be a great deal worse to be too fine, than to go to the farthest extreme of plainness. At least there would be nothing in the white muslin to excite ridicule. She put it on. She fastened a blue ribbon around her waist, and arranged her few, simple ornaments, and then turned to go down stairs. She opened the door, and Warren's arms enfolded her. "I have been waiting here for a whole half-hour, just to get a single kiss. My own little wild-flower, my darling." Grace's heart reproached her with the injustice that had deemed him changed or cold. He drew her forward into the light and looked at her eagerly. "Just as I hoped to see you," he said, exultingly. "My little white lily, so pure, so sweet. It's a blessed thing to have you here, among the artificial roses of this great city. As if any body could compare you with Miss Sommers."</p>
               <p>"Tell me all about her, Warren."</p>
               <p>"Oh, there isn't much to tell. She has been here about a week. I believe there was an old thought—I don't know whether it originated with her father or mine—that I should marry her, at some future time. My mother never favored it; and now that she is grown up, father wouldn't at all wish it; but, somehow or other, the young lady has got it into her head that it is to be, and it makes her insufferably stupid. She used to be a nice little thing enough, merry and romping, and every one called her (Wild Maggie Sommers.' She is Miss Margaretta now, or, as the initiated dub her; Maggie Margaretta. General Sommers was a widower, an old friend of my father's, and his bright little girl was coming up pretty much her own way, when a distant relative was so accommodating as to give up the ghost, leaving him a large fortune, and Mag became Miss Margaretta, and was promoted in a single day into tight corsets and a boarding-school. She is as insipid and languishing as your most poetical fancy could possibly imagine. She dresses—but there, I can't describe it! You are just right to-night, Grace—such a contrast!" He took a half-opened rosebud from<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7298-00000100"/> his buttonhole, and twined it carelessly in her golden curls, and then, once more folding her to his heart, led her down stairs. Leaning on his arm, she was composed and happy, though the first sight of those spacious parlors was bewildering to her unsophisticated eyes. Mrs. Clifford was there before her. Her velvet robes swept over the chair whereon she was seated, and the diamonds on her gleaming neck and arms seemed fairly to emit flashes of light. At a little distance, Miss Maggie Margaretta Sommers was half reclining upon a lounge. She was tall and slight, with a very slender waist, very light hair, which couldn't really make up its mind to curl, but floated poetically over her shoulders; rather light-blue eyes, of which the lids drooped languidly, while the short lashes pertinaciously curled upward. Her quite irregular features would have been very well, if she had but contented herself with the piquant, sparkling character nature originally designed her, but which suited very oddly the languishing, sentimental demeanor she had deemed it ladylike to assume. Her azure satin dress was a very miracle of elegance. It fitted the dainty little waist to perfection. Jewels sparkled on the thin, tapering arm, which rose, as Warren was wont to observe, like an inverted icicle, out of her sleeve of lace and satin; and jewels flashed on the thin, tapering fingers which supported her head. Warren gravely led Miss Atherton forward, and presented her. The young lady seemed to be in some doubt as to the propriety of rising, but one dainty satin slipper had protruded a little too far from under her costly robe. It was a good opportunity for adjusting it; so she rose, so gracefully as not to disorder a single fold of her drapery, languidly extended her hand, and then sank back again, in precisely the same attitude as before.</p>
               <p>The evening passed very wearily to the simple country girl. The chairs seemed a great deal too nice to be used, and the very books looked forbidding, in their bindings of gold and velvet. At home, and especially before visitors, Juno was very stately; and Grace Atherton, sitting quietly on her ottoman, could not imagine how she had ever dared to clasp that jewelled hand in her own, and press her plebeian kisses on that haughty face. There was one great comfort. They did not force her to talk. Even Warren, though he came and sat by her side occasionally, and seemed to take pleasure in watching her, was for the most part occupied in polite attentions to Miss Sommers' platitudes, and responding to the brilliant sallies of his fascinating mother. She had never before been placed in a situation so painfully awkward, and she had much ado to prevent the tears from coming to her eyes. It was a great relief when Mr. Clifford remarked, kindly, that she looked very much fatigued, and had better go up stairs.</p>
               <p>She rose instantly, and Warren came to her side.</p>
               <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7298-00000101"/>
               <p>JUNO CLIFFORD.</p>
               <p>"You do look half-tired to death, Gracie, and I'm going to help you to your room."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clifford's good-night was very kind and sweet-toned, but there was a shade of displeasure on her brow.</p>
               <p>"I know it has been terribly tiresome for you this evening, dearest," whispered Warren, with his arm around her waist, as they went up stairs, "but it'll be so different, when you've been here a few days, if only that Miss Maggie Margaretta was out of the way." They stood for perhaps five minutes at the head of the stairs, and then the quadroon made her appearance.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Clifford wished me to assist Miss Atherton," she remarked, in a quiet, matter-of-fact tone.</p>
               <p>"Very well, you can go into her room, and she will come to you in a moment." Warren detained Grace's hand while he spoke, and when the quadroon passed out of sight, he whispered, hurriedly—" Should you mind getting up very early, Grace? If you wouldn't, I should like to take you at sunrise for a walk on the common. Miss Sommers won't be about then." He might have added, "nor my mother, either."</p>
               <p>"I should like it very much," was the reply—" I will be down stairs in time."</p>
               <p>She went into her room, and patiently submitted to have her dress taken off, and her hair put back in bandeaux under her little muslin cap, and then gently asked if she might be left alone. By a hasty survey she saw there was no night-lamp in her room, and no matches; if she dressed by sunrise, according to her promise, she would have to ring for lights in the morning. There would be no difficulty about that, for the bell-pull was directly over the head of her bed, so she hastily finished undressing. She walked to the window, and looked out. It was not yet ten o'clock, and the streets were brilliantly lighted; but they looked very narrow and confined to those blue eyes, accustomed to take in the free range of hill, and field, and lake. She came back, and knelt down by the bedside. Grace Atherton was thoroughly religious in heart and life, and kneeling there, her heart grew happier. She forgot the pride and coldness which had seemed to rise up like walls about her sensitive nature; her soul called upward, and the cry was answered. The young and inexperienced cottage-girl could forget the high places of earth, and the timid dread which had shrunk from encountering them, for she was the heir to a higher heritage, travelling toward the Beautiful City, whose streets are paved with gold.</p>
               <p>The clock was striking six the next morning, when she unclosed her eyes. She pulled the bell, and in a moment a smiling face appeared at the door. "If you please, miss," said a voice, unmistakably Irish, "should you like to git up?"</p>
               <p>"Is no one else up in the house?" asked Miss Atherton, smiling.</p>
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7298-00000102"/>
               <p>"Jist the two of us, miss, Mr. Warren and me-self. The young gintleman gits up every morning to read, miss, and I git up to light his fire for him. Oh, but he's the raal gintleman."</p>
               <p>"Then, I suppose I can get up now, if I please?"</p>
               <p>"Shure, the young gintleman expects you, miss. He said I was to light your fire, and help you about dressing; so if you'll jist please to lie still, I'll have the room warm for you in a moment."</p>
               <p>Grace felt very cheerful. There was something fresh and piquant in the sparkling, handsome face of her Hibernian attendant, and there was all the charm of novelty in lying there, in the lamp-light, watching the kindling of the coal fire. "Mary," called a voice half way up the stairs. The girl sprang to the door. Coming back, she said, "Shure if you please, miss, he says the morning is cowld, and ye'll want plenty of wrapping."</p>
               <p>"Dear, kind Warren, how careful of my comfort,' thought the young girl, with a blush.</p>
               <p>She was quickly dressed. Somehow it was so much easier to ask assistance from the cheerful, and good-humored Irish girl, than it had been to receive it even from Juno Clifford's stately maid, the evening previous. She went gayly down stairs, almost tempted to break into a snatch of song.</p>
               <p>The walk on the breezy, beautiful common was very pleasant, and the sunrise was glorious. With the keen fresh wind in her face, and Warren talking hopefully about the beautiful future, over whose paths they were to wander hand in hand, she forgot that there were in all the world such troublesome, weary visitants as care and sorrow. But the illusion was not to last. The breakfast parlor was warm and cheerful, but, somehow, Grace experienced a sudden sensation of chill as she entered it, though she had not thought of the cold during her breezy morning walk. Miss Sommers curled her lip with a half-defined sneer, and there was something in the tone and manner of Juno's—"You're indeed an early riser—we were hardly prepared for such excellent country habits"—which Grace felt as a reproof. When the breakfast hour was over, she hastened to her own room. There, in a tiny vase, stood the rosebud Warren had twined in her curls, the evening previous. She pressed it tenderly to her lips. There was something like a caress in the touch of those velvet petals. It seemed as if she had grown old many years, in the last four and twenty hours. Then she chided herself for the indulgence of these feelings. She remembered that if she was Warren's wife, she must pass her whole future life there, and she gave one glance to the splendor around her, and tried to think it would be pleasant. There was a light tap upon her door, and Juno Clifford entered. Once more the proud woman folded her in her arms, and swayed her by the irresistible magnetism of her<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7298-00000103"/> looks, her caresses, and her low, sweetly modulated tones. She feared she had made a great mistake, she said, in inviting Miss Sommers to the house. She could not feel free before her herself, and she was sure Grace could not; but then she had got her there, and she must make the best of it. It was a good thing Grace had come, for notwithstanding all her foolishness, poor Margaretta <emph>was</emph> elegant-looking and had all the prestige of rank and fashion on her side, and Warren was getting too much interested in her, "but never mind, love," she added with another kiss, "that's all over now."</p>
               <p>Then very skilfully she managed to lead the conversation to Warren's early life. "You will keep it from your father, of course, that we found the poor child hawking papers; so few know it, it cannot hurt him now, but it might render your father averse to the marriage."</p>
               <p>The girl's cheek crimsoned. "Mrs. Clifford," she said, firmly, "my father knew that long ago; it would ill become a village blacksmith for such a cause to refuse his daughter's hand."</p>
               <p>"A village blacksmith!" A quick gleam of joy kindled Juno's eyes.</p>
               <p>The color deepened on Miss Atherton's face, but her tone did not in the least falter, "Yes, madam, my father worked with his own hands at the forge and anvil, until he was worth enough to buy our pleasant home, and the few acres of land around it."</p>
               <p>"Warren surely doesn't know of this?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know. He may have heard it from Mr. Hastings. I do not think I ever mentioned it to him, though I certainly never thought of concealing it."</p>
               <p>"Well, but you must think of it now. You could not for an instant think the fact would make any difference with me, but Warren; Grace, I could not tell you how strong the pride of birth is in him. He is English to the core of his heart If he never knows it, it can do him no harm, but if he had known it, he never would have asked you to become his wife."</p>
               <p>"Then he shall know it instantly." She rose from her seat as she spoke, and stood there, her young head lifted, her slight figure drawn up, her eyes flashing, and her whole frame quivering with intense excitement. "He shall know. I am proud of my old grey-headed father. He has walked with God now to a serene old age, and there is not an act in his whole life for which his child has cause to blush. If Warren Clifford could love me less, because my father's hands have grown hard with honest toil, <emph>it is time.</emph> I will go home, where my voice and my steps are welcome, and pray Heaven to banish his image from my heart."</p>
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7298-00000104"/>
               <p>Tears came into her eyes, which she bowed her head to conceal, and then Juno folded her to her heart. "Dear, noble Grace," she whispered, in her soft, treacherous tones, "he could not love you less. He would glory in you as I do. You shall indeed tell him all, but you are <emph>my</emph> child now; grant me one prayer. In two weeks I shall give a large and brilliant party. I give it to introduce our sweet, new daughter to my friends, and you must promise me to wait until after it is over; I have good, true reasons."</p>
               <p>"But how can I? I shall feel every moment till the whole is told, like a traitor stealing into his heart under false pretences. I shall expect to lose his love; it will be standing on the brink of a volcano."</p>
               <p>"Not if I who know, tell you he will but love you better. My first thought was of his pride, but I know he prizes unstained truth and fearless honesty more than all. Fear nothing, only wait for my sake. Promise me, my sweet, sweet Grace, my daughter!"</p>
               <p>The fond words and the caress which accompanied them triumphed, and half reluctantly the promise was accorded.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XV. MRS. CLIFFORD'S GREAT PARTY.</head>
               <p>THE next two weeks passed wearily to our timid Grace. It is true Juno was caressingly affectionate as ever, and Warren was still kind and tender whenever they were alone, but somehow she seemed to see very little of him. There was a constant round of driving, and calling, and in the evening, theatres, and operas, and concerts, which absorbed all the time; though Juno made it a point to refuse all invitations for herself, until Miss Atherton had been properly introduced by the great party, which, in one way and another, was a prominent idea with every one in the household. Warren was absent several evenings in close attendance upon Miss Sommers, who had taken it in her head to be present at one or two fashionable reunions. Their adventurous morning walk had never been repeated; and daily her heart grew heavier with doubt, whether even his love remained to her, and ached more and more wearily, to hear one of the old, accustomed words of tenderness. She still perservered<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7298-00000105"/> severed in what Mrs. Clifford had called her country habit of early rising, but her mornings were spent until breakfast in her own room. One morning, as she lay watching her good-humored Irish handmaiden in her task of kindling the fire, she observed her quietly raise her checked apron to her face. "Mary," she said. The girl turned suddenly, and her eyes were full of tears. "Mary, the fire will burn now; come and sit down here, I want to know what has been troubling you so these few days back." Half timidly the girl obeyed her, and she reached forward and took that hard hand tenderly in her own delicate fingers. "What is it, Mary?"</p>
               <p>A gush of tears answered her, and it was several moments before she could speak. "It's all along of poor Pathrick, miss. He's been in the hospital this many weeks. He was in a decline, but they thought he would get better, and now he's sinking. They say it's not many days he can live."</p>
               <p>"Is he your brother?" asked Miss Atherton, kindly.</p>
               <p>A deep blush kindled Mary's face. "We are promised," she said, in a low tone. "He staid behind me in Ireland till he buried his owld father and mother, and he's been in America for a year, come next Easter, It's seven years we've been waiting."</p>
               <p>"And you so young?"</p>
               <p>"I was fifteen when we took the vow, miss; and shure it's true we've been all the time. Och hone! but he was a purty boy, though he's white and thin now." Tenderly, as if she had been one whom the world called her equal, Grace led her on to unfold all her sorrow; and drawing near to the sobbing girl, wept more quietly, but it may be more bitterly, thankful to make the excuse to her own heart, that she was weeping for the woes of another.</p>
               <p>And so two hearts ached wearily in that stately mansion, while the preparations for the party went on. A distinguished upholsterer superintended the arrangement of the rooms, the supper table was confided to an artiste of the first rank, and the crowning charm was given by the poetic touches of the quadroon. Wherever she went, she seemed absolutely to shower beauty. The broad staircases, the halls, and the passages were lined with the costliest flowers; but there was a genuine poem in every bouquet of her arranging, which would have distinguished it to the most careless observer. Dreamily, half sadly, Grace Atherton watched the preparations. <emph>She</emph> had none to make. She was to wear the white tarleton dress, and Warren had petitioned for white rosebuds in her hair. It did not seem to her that she had any part in the matter, but yet the costly and brilliant preparations fascinated her attention.</p>
               <p>There was one plan, however, which had not reached her ears. The morning before the party, our<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7298-00000106"/> lady Juno took Miss Sommers into her confidence. Closing the door of her own private room upon the confidante she had summoned, she said, with an abruptness unusual to her—" Miss Sommers, you want to be Warren Clifford's wife!"</p>
               <p>The young lady addressed made an ineffectual attempt at blushing, and half stifled in her perfumed <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mouchoir</foreign> a little scream. Juno's lip curled as if in involuntary contempt of her own self, and the part she was acting. Very dryly she remarked, "This is quite unnecessary with me, Miss Sommers. Spare the blushes, I entreat, until the young gentleman himself is at your feet. Was my question too presuming to claim an answer?"</p>
               <p>"You have penetrated the veil, Mrs. Clifford, with which I strove to conceal my feelings. I do indeed love your son."</p>
               <p>Juno's lip curled still more, but her tone was very quiet—" Well, you have noticed his fancy for Miss Atherton."</p>
               <p>"Is it only a fancy, madam?"</p>
               <p>"That depends. If you have noticed it, you must feel that until her influence over him is lost, you can have no hope of success. Now you can bring this about; you have it in your own hands."</p>
               <p>"Me! How, Mrs. Clifford?"</p>
               <p>"Listen. You know already that Warren is not our son, but you do not know that he is come from one of the noblest families in all England. Pride of birth is the strongest sentiment in his nature. Miss Atherton's father has been a blacksmith. She told me so with her own lips. Warren does not know it, and with difficulty I persuaded her to conceal it from him until after to-night. Do you see how this will serve you?"</p>
               <p>"Warren will give her up when he finds it out, I suppose, but I don't see what I have to do with it."</p>
               <p>"Warren will not give her up, if she tells him herself. He will give her up, if he thinks she has deceived him. Do you see now what you have to do? My guests to-night will be of the most aristocratic order. You know most of them. You can easily contrive to make your neglect of Miss Atherton sufficiently marked to attract attention. Then you must privately give her obscure parentage as a reason. The whisper will circulate through the room, and the result we desire will follow. Warren will be mortified by the coolness with which his lady love is received, and when he learns the reason, he will think she has deceived and imposed upon him, and despise her. You must be very careful to conceal your own share in the affair. Just start the whisper, but tell them they must not couple your name with it, and above all things, in no instance give me as your authority."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mrs. Clifford," sighed the fair Margaretta, "you have indeed proved yourself my friend. My<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7298-00000107"/> heart thrills with gratitude, and I forget to blush that you have discovered my secret." She sank on her knees, and pressed the lady's fingers to her lips. Juno shook her off, almost roughly. "You needn't thank me," she said, with a bitter smile, "<emph>I</emph> don't want him to marry this Miss Atherton, myself, and he shall not, <emph>he shall not.</emph> There, go to your room and think it all over." She watched the retreating figure of the sentimental young lady, with the same bitter smile, and when the door closed, she laughed a scornful laugh. "Well see, dainty little wild flower; sweet little cottage girl, we'll see who'll be mistress of Clifford House!"</p>
               <p>Then she leaned back her head against the chair and abandoned herself to thought. Sometimes her brow was compressed, and her teeth closely set; then a smile would flood her face with its rare sunshine, and her foot would tap upon the carpet, as if beating time to strains of cheerful music. The luncheon bell rang, but she did not-go down. Warren was away on business, and John Clifford came and went without entering her apartment. It was nearly sunset in the short winter afternoon, when there was a light tap upon her door. "Come in," she said, dreamingly, but she gave a little start of surprise when Irish Mary answered her summons, and stood blushing and silent before her. "What do you want?" she asked, after a moment. Still more terrified, the poor girl burst into tears. "You had better go away until you can tell me quietly what you came for, "said Juno, coldly.</p>
               <p>The girl drew nearer. "Oh, ma'am," she murmured huskily, "he is worse, he will die. He has sent for me. Can I go to him? Poor Pathrick, he is there by himsel', and he greets for me so."</p>
               <p>Juno drew herself up with an air of haughty, frigid indifference. "You have annoyed me about this man in the hospital, till I can't bear it much longer; I don't want you here, if I'm to have you running off every day or two, to see a man die, somewhere or other. How do I know there is any such man? You can't go to-day, it's out of the question. If you do, you need never come back again. Every one about the house is needed until the last guest has left. You may go as early as you please in the morning, if you'll get some one to light the fires, but if you go to-night you can stay when you get there."</p>
               <p>The girl bowed her head and went out, trying to choke back the sobs that convulsed her whole frame with their violence. She had borne meekly with many whims and caprices, for the sick one's sake, and she would strive to bear with this one also. If she went away without a character, another place was a very uncertain hope; and if she were left homeless and destitute, whence would come the little luxuries that Patrick Regan said were better than all the Doctor's stuff, when Mary brought them. She would try to<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7298-00000108"/> wait till morning, and God wouldn't let him die till she had seen him, and kissed him just once more.</p>
               <p>"Stupid, disagreeable creature," muttered Juno as the door closed behind her. "She'll be asking, the next thing, to have us send her over to the hospital in the carriage. I wish I had staid South. I would, if it weren't for those absurd, vulgar notions about abolition, John Clifford picked up somewhere, along with the rest of his low breeding. I'd like to <emph>own</emph> my servants, <emph>body and soul,</emph> and we'd see if they'd get troublesome."</p>
               <p>Oh, but that lofty house on Mount Vernon street was all aglow with light and beauty that December midnight. It was the evening before Christmas. At one end of the long hall stood the Christmas tree, glittering with bonbons, and heavy with the costly gifts which were not to be taken down until the next morning. Through the magnificent drawing-rooms moved ladies, lustrous with silks, and gleaming with jewels. The trees, and the tall flowering shrubs in the conservatory, were hung with lights, and among them wandered in pairs the young and happy, uttering words, perchance, whose echo was to float through all time, and be borne outward on the air of Eternity. The refreshment tables glittered with massive plate, the staircases were fragrant with the breath of southern flowers, and <q>
                     <l>"All went merry as a marriage bell."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The beautiful hostess wore a robe of rich purple velvet, heavily wrought with gold. Her neck and arms gleamed like unsoiled snow, through the misty folds of the point lace scarf, floating like a cloud around her. Diamonds lit up the midnight of her hair, encircled her wrists, and rose and fell upon her bosom. But brighter than the gems were the large, oriental eyes, flashing from under her drooped lashes; softer than the folds of the velvet, the peach-like bloom of her rounded cheek. Near her stood Miss Sommers, radiant in a superb white silk, brocaded with silver. There was an evil look in her light-blue eyes, albeit her manners were characterized by the same air of languishing softness. At a little distance was Miss Atherton. She had purposely withdrawn herself from observation. Standing amid the gay throng, she felt that she was not of them, and yet no one, whose eye once rested on her, could fail to look again, and yet again. There was a singular purity, a look almost of heaven, about that young face. The white tarleton was the simplest costume in all those crowded rooms, and the sweet face of its wearer might well have been likened to the angels. The mirth was at its height. In another room, merry feet were keeping time to the joyous music. The lights poured down their floods of radiance; jests and repartees sparkled on crimson threaded lips, and there was no pause for thanksgiving, when the Christmas morning broke.</p>
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7298-00000109"/>
               <p>There was yet another watcher in the moonlight and the midnight of December. A patient nurse sat beside a low bed in the hospital. Its occupant seemed already, in the expressive New England phraseology, struck with death. His brow, fair and white as a woman's, was already moist with the death-sweat. He raised his thin fingers, and pushed off the damp brown curls. His large, mournful eyes were lifted for a moment to heaven, then he said, in a low, entreating tone—"<emph>Can't</emph> you send for Mary?"</p>
               <p>"We did send this afternoon, don't you remember? She cannot be here now till morning."</p>
               <p>He was silent. All the weary hours of that mournful night, he had tossed upon his pillow, calling restlessly for Mary. More than once the kind eyes of the nurse had filled with tears, accustomed as she had been to stand beside the death-beds of the friendless. "Is it most daybreak?" he said again, after a moment. He had taken no heed of the midnight chimes.</p>
               <p>"Not quite," said the nurse, gently.</p>
               <p>"Oh, she will come when it is morning. Her blue eyes will shine on me. I shall die looking at them. Mary! Mary! A sad heart she'll be bearing, all the years of her life. Oh, I would fain take her with me, but I must go alone. Oh, the hard pain has come again, I shall die before she can get here. Come a little nearer. Tell Mary, when I am gone, how I loved her. Tell her she was the very pulse of my heart. It will comfort her to think that we loved each other always, that there was never the hard word between us. Tell her she is my wife, and I called her so in dying. Oh the weary, painful nights I have said her name over and over, and she does not come to me. It is hard. It is hard. Must I die here alone in the strange, far off counthry? What, is it daylight? The morning breaks very bright. The sun shines. Mary! Mary!"—The nurse bowed her head amid her tears—the low voice ceased—the eyelids drooped—downward—the brow grew ever colder and colder—the clock struck one, and the Christmas morning broke over the face of the dead!</p>
               <p>There was a momentary pause when Miss Atherton followed Juno Clifford into the dancing room. A gentleman who had been presented to her, earlier in the evening, came forward, and solicited her hand for a quadrille that was just forming. At nearly the same moment one of the perfumed scions of Upper-tendom approached Miss Sommers. Come, lady fair," he said, gayly, taking her hand, "I believe I had the promise of this dance."</p>
               <p>Grace had already taken her place, and Miss Margaretta drew back, for a moment, haughtily surveying the group before her—" Excuse me, but I cannot dance with Miss Atherton for a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vis-a-vis.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Will you explain?"</p>
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7298-00000110"/>
               <p>"Yes, I may be too exclusive, but I think Margaretta Sommers could hardly be expected to dance opposite the daughter of a village blacksmith."</p>
               <p>"Lou, Lou Ethrington, look here," exclaimed the exquisite to his fashionable sister. Miss Sommers placed her hand upon his arm, and said in a low whisper, "Do not give me as authority, I insist upon it. It would be so embarrassing while I'm staying in the same house, Mrs. Clifford did not know the fact when she invited her, and she will pack her off as soon as possible, but we must keep quiet until she is gone. Be careful."</p>
               <p>"As wise as a serpent," was the laughing reply; then turning to his sister, who had now reached his side—"Well, my aristocratic Miss Louise Ethrington, that young lady in white I saw you making such friends with, an hour ago, is the hopeful heiress of a village blacksmith."</p>
               <p>"Not his daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, his daughter."</p>
               <p>"And Mrs. John Clifford insulted us by inviting us to meet her? I shall cut her acquaintance."</p>
               <p>The young man laughed. "Don't be terrible, sis. You know well enough you will do no such thing, for Mrs. Clifford is too much the fashion. Her entertainments are the most brilliant in the city. To do the lady justice, though, I believe she did not know her guest's station when she invited her, and she is too much of a Southerner to fail in the rites of hospitality, now she has made the discovery."</p>
               <p>"A blacksmith's daughter, and young Vernon is dancing with her; I must tell his sister." She glided gracefully across the room, full of the important secret, and thus the ball was set in motion. When the dance was over, young Vernon led his tired partner to a seat, and went himself for an ice. On the way he met his sister, and learned the astounding fact that he, the son of a millionaires, the grandson of a—huckster woman, had been dancing with a blacksmith's daughter. He was a good-hearted fellow, naturally, and the young girl's unaffected simplicity had really interested him; but the fear of ridicule was stronger even than the instinct of gentlemanly courtesy; he did not return. Gradually the whisper spread and the circle around Grace widened, until she was quite alone, her slight figure and bowed head a mark for all the curious eyes in the room. Warren, standing at a distance, had seen the whole affair in pantomime, but he had heard nothing. Crossing the room hurriedly he laid his hand upon his mother's arm. "Mother," he said, in a husky whisper, "what does this mean? You see how Grace is treated."</p>
               <p>Juno raised her glass and surveyed the room. There was a quick gleam of satisfaction in her eyes, which he failed to notice, for their expression was very tender, almost sorrowful, when she turned to him.</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7298-00000111"/>
               <p>"I see it," she said, "but I could not help it. They have discovered that she is a blacksmith's daughter, and they will not dance with her, or talk to her."</p>
               <p>"A blacksmith! Mr. Atherton is no more a blacksmith than I am."</p>
               <p>"He was, my son."</p>
               <p>"Are you certain? "</p>
               <p>"Positive!"</p>
               <p>"And you concealed it from me? "</p>
               <p>"How could I refuse? I thought if you never knew it, it could not harm you, and I had no idea of any such mortifying discovery as this of to-night."</p>
               <p>He turned away, and deliberately approached Grace. There was a look upon his face which she had never seen there before. He bent over he? and offered her his arm. "You are tired," he said; "this is very late for you; had you not better retire?" Mechanically she obeyed him. He led her from the room, and supported her trembling footsteps to the very door of her own apartment. Then, bowing coldly, he was about to turn away. Not a word had passed, between them since they left the dancing-room. The silence drove her to desperation. She threw her arms about his neck and sobbed out, "Oh, Warren, don't leave me so. It will kill me. Don't you love me, your own little Grace?" His heart was fairly wild with sorrow for the grief he was causing her, and yet deeper anguish at the thought that she whom he so loved and trusted had deceived him; but he resolutely controlled his emotion, and said calmly, "Miss Atherton is best aware how true she has been to me—how much reason I have to treat her lovingly. I believe I must go. My absence will be remarked by the guests."</p>
               <p>Her outstretched arms sank powerless by her side. She permitted him to go away without another word, and then walked quietly into her room and shut the door. Twice he stole back again to listen, and note if there were sob or sound to betoken that she suffered from his words. He heard none. He knew not that there were seasons of agony, when even in woman's heart the tears that cannot rise to the dry, stony eyes, <emph>fall inward,</emph> seething, choking; bitterer than any gentle rain which moistens the cambric handkerchief, or makes dew-drops among a lover's hair. He turned away and joined the gay throng below, with a smile upon his lips; and she sat motionless, with her clasped hands, her wide opened eyes, and her throbbing heart. After a time she rose, still calmly, tearlessly, and took off her festal garb. It was the first time his tone had ever fallen harshly or coldly upon her ears. She could not guess the reason. Absorbed in her own thoughts, she had hardly noticed, and quite failed to comprehend the attempt which had been made to mortify her. She thought he must be jealous; jealous, perhaps, because she had danced with<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7298-00000112"/> another, and yet he had danced half the evening, and not once with her. She could not comprehend it. She knelt down by her bedside and offered a childlike yet fervent prayer to Heaven, and then the blessed tears came to her relief. She threw herself upon the bed, and sobbed herself into a troubled sleep. It was ten o'clock when she awoke.</p>
               <p>The sun was pouring brightly through the windows. There was a heavy weight upon her heart, but she could not at first remember its cause. She raised herself upon her elbow, and glanced around the room. The fire was not yet lighted, but there, before the grate, was Mary crouched upon the floor, and swaying herself restlessly to and fro. Her face was covered by her hands and her coarse apron. Very gently Grace called her name. The hands dropped upon her lap, and the face she lifted struck a thrill, almost of terror, to Miss Atherton's heart. The lips were white and bloodless, the hair hung in elf-locks over the ghastly face, and the blue eyes, usually so mild and quiet, glittered like live coals of fire. "I curse her, I curse her!" burst from the compressed lips.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mary, that is wrong. Come here and tell me what it is that has grieved you so."</p>
               <p>There is always a kind of irresistible authority in a firm yet gentle tone, and the girl struggled with her tears and threw herself on her knees before the bedside side. She spoke in a low yet passionate voice. "Oh, Miss Grace, Miss Grace, it's jist me heart that's breaking. I can feel it ache. They sint for me yesterday to come to my poor Pathrick. They towld me he was worse, and I went to the misthress. She refused intirely, and I knew if I was afther goin', I could never come back here again, and, may-be, I wouldn't find another place till he'd be gone, and then where would be all the jellies, and oranges, and the nice dhrinks I'd buy for him? So I jist staid, with a sad heart in my bosom. This morning, soon as the last carriage drove away, I went to him. Oh how shall I tell it!—he was dead, dead, and cowld, and stiff! He had died an hour after midnight, all the time calling for me, and saying I was his wife. Far away in the strange counthry, with not a frind to the fore. Nobody to stand beside his bed, to give him a sup of dhrink but the stranger."</p>
               <p>"Didn't they send for the priest? "</p>
               <p>"Is it the praste? My poor Pathrick was a protestant. We both believed in the good Saviour and forsook the false doctrines intirely."</p>
               <p>"And yet you could curse Mrs. Clifford. Wouldn't he say this was very wrong? "</p>
               <p>"Oh, may the blessed Jesus forgive me, but I was wild with the hard pain. I'll not curse her again, but I'll never eat bread in her house. And where can I go, with no character and no frinds?"</p>
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7298-00000113"/>
               <p>Grace reflected for a moment. She could not think it wrong to encourage the poor girl in leaving, and yet it might bring trouble on her own head. Glenthorne Katy was going to be married, and surely it could be no sin to take this suffering, homeless girl in her stead, "Could you go to Glenthorne alone, Mary, and find Mr. Russel Atherton?"</p>
               <p>"Is it where yees came from? I could do it aisy."</p>
               <p>"Well, our girl will leave us soon, and if you would like to live with me, I will send a note to my father, and you shall stay as long as you like. Will you go to-day?"</p>
               <p>"May the dear (3-od bless you, for shure it's Himself has found a home for me, when I'm bowed down with the bitter trouble. I will go to-morrow. Today my poor Pathrick is to be put in his grave, and I must stay by till it is over."</p>
               <p>"Well, come to me early to-morrow morning, and I will give you the letter, and let no one here know where you are going, not even Mr. Warren."</p>
               <p>The girl rose, and turned toward the grate. It seemed as if her sorrow had in some sort passed from her mind, as she listened to Miss Atherton's plan for her future, and now it came over her again with an increased intensity. She turned toward the bed a frightful, ghastly face—she fairly shrieked, "He is dead!" and fell down on the floor in another paroxysm of grief. I suppose Juno Clifford and all her aristocratic friends would have been still more shocked with the plebeian, blacksmith's daughter, could they have seen her spring from her couch, and throwing a shawl around her shoulders fold her arms about that weeping girl, and whisper over, and over, and over again, the soothing, blessed promises our Father has given for the encouragement of His suffering children. There were eyes which witnessed the scene, holy eyes of saints and angels—there was a voice which said, "Well done, good and faithful servant. Inasmuch as thou hast done it unto the least of these, thou hast done it unto me!"</p>
               <p>It was a long time ere she could win to those wailing lips aught but the prolonged, sorrowful cry, "He is dead!" but at last there came a Heaven-sent calm; and when the low, sweet voice uttered our Saviour's words of promise—"Thy dead shall rise again," the stricken one lifted her bowed head, and said, fervently, "Amen, God be praised!" And then she rose calmly, as you and I have seen Heaven's pensioners, the poor, arise from many another strife with sorrow, and went about her daily tasks. Oh, how often to such the practical language of the rich and great has been—"What need of pause—let the dead bury their dead."</p>
               <p>Absorbed in her sympathy with this great sorrow, Grace entered the breakfast room, half oblivious of<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7298-00000114"/> her own grief. Mr. Clifford's good morning was cordial as ever, Juno addressed her in the old, treacherous; caressing tones; the half-sneer on Miss Sommers' face was unchanged; but Warren rose, with the same cold, ceremonious politeness which had characterized their parting of the evening before, and handing her a small casket remarked, "A Christmas present for you, I presume. A boy brought it to the door, and said he was directed to leave it for Miss Atherton."</p>
               <p>Her eyes filled with tears, but she courageously prevented them from falling, and opened the box. A tiny gold chain lay before her, of exquisite workmanship, and attached to it, instead of the customary cross, were a miniature hammer and anvil. In her confusion she let both the casket and the ornament fall upon the floor. Warren raised them with mock civility. "A most appropriate gift," he remarked, with a half-suppressed sneer, "it surely came from some one better informed as to your circumstances than myself; very probably from your admirer of last evening, Mr. Vernon."</p>
               <p>These words brought a stray gleam of hope to the girl's heart. He surely was jealous; then he must love her. She said with a forced yet dignified calmness, "Follow me to the drawing-room for a moment, I wish to speak to you."</p>
               <p>He was too much of a gentleman, even in his anger ger, to refuse compliance with her request. He passed on after her into the drawing-room, and shutting the door, stood with his back against it.</p>
               <p>"Warren," she said, in the same calm, low tone, "I must have an explanation of your changed manner. You are paining me very much."</p>
               <p>"Yes," he said, bitterly, "and I suppose you have quite forgotten that I was at all pained and mortified last night?"</p>
               <p>"Do you mean with Mr. Vernon? Were you jealous of him, Warren?"</p>
               <p>"Jealous of him! Jealous of a man who had not respect enough for you to return and bring you an ice, after he found you were a blacksmith's daughter? Oh yes, I was very jealous of Mr. Vernon! But I'll give you the explanation you want; I was mortified to see my betrothed wife a mark for scorn, and contempt, and ridicule to all the room, and far worse than this, was the pain of feeling that the one I most fondly loved and trusted had deceived me."</p>
               <p>"Then you <emph>did</emph> love me?"—The words came tremblingly from her lips, and at last her self-control gave way, and she burst into tears.</p>
               <p>"Faugh!" he cried, angrily, "stop that, <emph>please</emph>—you disgust me. As long as you were true, every tear you shed was sacred. You might have wept all night upon my breast, but <emph>now</emph>—you have been false in other things, and most likely these very tears are a piece of<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7298-00000115"/> beautiful acting." But she did not seem to hear, or heed, his cruel words; with her face buried in her hands, she wept on. Then his mood changed. He went up to her, and resolutely removing her hands from her face, said firmly, but not unkindly, "Look up, and tell me, Grace, why did you deceive me?"</p>
               <p>The blue eyes fearlessly met his own, a look of earnest truth shining through their tears—"I never did, Warren."</p>
               <p>"Then why did you not tell me, long ago, that your father had been a blacksmith?"</p>
               <p>"You had lived so long in Glenthorne, I supposed you knew it, and I never thought of its making any difference. I should have spoken of it long ago, had I dreamed it could make you love me less."</p>
               <p>"How, then, did my mother know it?"</p>
               <p>"I told her. I spoke of it as naturally and freely as I would of any other thing, and then she said you did not know it. I was going to tell you, but she said you would love me less, and—"she paused, for at that moment she recollected that it would be a betrayal of Mrs. Clifford's confidence, to speak of the promise she had made.</p>
               <p>Warren lifted her soothingly in his arms, and whispered, "And so you feared to lose my love, my poor Grace. With such a motive, I were less than human not to forgive you. But the affair has mortified me horribly; and then, this insulting present is worst of all. Who could have sent it If I knew, man or woman, they should pay for it dearly."</p>
               <p>Grace could not help feeling it a little hard to be forgiven when she was not guilty; but she thought Mrs. Clifford had loved her, and acted for her good, and come what would, she was too honorable to betray her. Little did she dream that Juno herself was the donor of the mysterious present, and had caused it to be made with an eye to this very denouement. She was glad to regain, at any cost, the dear love she deemed her life's best blessing, and she sat there in his arms, looking gratefully into his eyes. He held her very tenderly, and bent, every now and then, to press his lips to her cheek or brow; but she could see from the glitter in his eye, that the inward tempest was not yet over. "If I could have dreamed of this," he said, after a moment, "you should never have appeared at that party, never. I would not have had you or myself so mortified. How <emph>could</emph> those people have heard of it?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know. Is it then so terrible, so disgraceful?"</p>
               <p>"Not in my eyes, Grace, whatever my mother may have thought I should feel about it; but it's a pretty effectual sentence of banishment from Up-Town society."</p>
               <p>At that moment Juno Clifford lifted her stately head from the keyhole of the drawing-room door,<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7298-00000116"/> and walked leisurely to her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir.</foreign> There was surely no disgrace in listening, for no one knew it. She forgot God and the angels, but she seldom thought of them; and now her heart was swelling with triumph, that the young girl she had injured had not betrayed her.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding her reconciliation with her lover, Grace was haunted by a painful consciousness that she had somehow fallen in his esteem. He was evidently bitterly mortified, both at the scene of the previous evening, and the sarcastic present. She could see that these memories would be a long time in passing from his mind. Indeed, how could she hope he would ever forget them, should she become his wife? Had he not said they would for ever exclude her from the circle in which he was accustomed to move, and so, shut out from his old friends for her sake, would he not remember them bitterly? Her heart ached, and she longed to go home, and rest her head upon her mother's breast, and seek the advice and sympathy which had never yet failed her. And so, to the letter of which the sorrowing Irish girl was to be the bearer, she added this postscript:—</p>
               <p>"Send for me to come home, dear mother. My heart is like to break, and I cannot come until I hear from you. They would think me angry or ungrateful. I do not want to stay here. This beautiful house seems like a great prison—the perfumed air stifles me—the very sunshine mocks me, and I am wretched. What am I saying? I do not mean that. Every one is kind to me, and I've nothing of which to complain, but all this splendor wearies me. It is as if you should send the lowly thrush to dwell in the eyrie of the eagle. <emph>Mayn't</emph> I come home?"</p>
               <p>When she opened her eyes the next morning, Irish Mary stood beside her bed, with her shawl on, and her bonnet in her hand.</p>
               <p>"I built your fire one more mornin', Miss Grace, darlin'. I'm goin' now. Would I take the letter?"</p>
               <p>"Is it car-time?"</p>
               <p>"No, miss, but I'm jist goin' to walk. I spent my last money for poor Pathrick's burial."</p>
               <p>"Have you told Mrs. Clifford you are going?"</p>
               <p>"Shure I did that same last evening. She said she was glad to get rid of me, but if I was goin' off in this ondacent manner, she should give me no character, and I wouldn't get my last month's wages."</p>
               <p>"Not get your wages?"</p>
               <p>"No, miss, you see I did not give her warning."</p>
               <p>For an instant Grace said nothing. Could it be that Juno Clifford, so rich, so beautiful, so seemingly gentle, so lavish in every expenditure, would make use of such a pitiful pretext to gratify a petty revenge, and send the poor Irish girl out into the world penniless? She would have been still more shocked, had she known that the prime cause was the girl's apparent<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7298-00000117"/> devotion to herself. She rose, and took her purse from the bureau by her bedside. She had had several little purchases to make, and it was not very well filled; but she drew forth a five-dollar bill, and said, gently, "There, Mary; you need not hesitate to take it. You are going to my father's, and I shall not have you walking in this bitter cold. Here is the letter."</p>
               <p>The poor girl sank on her knees before her, in speechless gratitude, and Grace fairly started as her eyes fell on that upturned face. It had changed so, in one short twenty-four hours—it wore such an expression of hopeless misery. "Have you been crying, Mary?" she asked, bending over her.</p>
               <p>"No, miss. The heart was too sore for that. My eyes wouldn't shut up the night. I kept seein' him, there in the coffin, with the dirt fallin' on him. Oh, it's a bitter grief, and a long one, and I could not see him die. If I had only been there, and kissed him, and answered him when lie called me his wife, and towld him I'd never be that same to another. But no, I couldn't go to him. The grand folks must have their great party, and now <emph>he's dead!</emph>"</p>
               <p>It was in vain to try to console her, or hush that endless wail which came momently up from her "heart. Grace could only soothe her with a few gentle words about the home and friends she was going to, and then she went out, in the cold gray morning, with her tearless, stony eyes, and the gore pain which mocked at all human words of consolation.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XVI. NEW YEAR'S IN TWO PLACES.</head>
               <p>NEW YEAR'S day dawned clear, and bright, and cold. Simon Goldthwaite looked out of the window of the little den he called his private counting-room. The streets literally swarmed with gentlemen on their way to the parlors of their lady friends. Now and then a sleigh dashed by, with its sleek, prancing horses, its liveried servants, and the bright young face of its mistress raised to the manly countenance bending over her; the cheeks flushed, the eyes sparkling like beads, and the whole expression speaking that genuine happiness which so rarely lingers after the first fresh enthusiasm of youth. He seemed to take pleasure in the sight, and then he turned away with a little inward chuckle of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Poor boy," he said aloud, "why should I not help him to bring his mother to the city? I have no one else to help. How pleased he will be when I tell him his salary is raised to one thousand a year. After all, four hundred of it isn't much to pay out of my own<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7298-00000118"/> pocket; I can't give it to him any other way, for he's too proud to let me help him if he knew it. Heigho, he'll think the firm are getting generous;" and he chuckled again, rubbing his hands as if excessively delighted.</p>
               <p>"Hallo! Dick, my boy, good news for you. You've got the situation, and your salary raised to a thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"A thousand dollars! Am I dreaming? I must go and thank them this moment."</p>
               <p>Simon smiled—"You must do no such thing. I have known them longer than you, and they would not like it. Now I suppose we shall have brave doings. I shall have to go all over the city to hunt you up a house. Let me see, it shall be in Brooklyn, and near South Ferry. That will be so pleasant. They can come across on the pleasant summer days, and go to walk on the Battery, and then up Broadway to the store. It will be the best walk for Mabel."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Goldthwaite, how kind, how good; you have planned it all. It is just what I should like. How I wish you were a woman."</p>
               <p>"Would you marry me?" asked Simon, with imperturbable gravity—"would you, really?" and as if with greatly increased self-complacency, he stroked an apology for a whisker of terribly uncertain color.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, but I am so happy. I wished you were a woman, so I could kiss you."</p>
               <p>For a moment Simon's brow was shaded. Unheeded the tears gathered in his eyes, and his voice trembled. "The last kiss I ever received, my mother gave me, the night before she died. All these years since no lips were ever pressed to brow or cheek of mine. Sometimes I think I can feel it still, and hear over again the tones of her good-night blessing. Oh, this friendless life has seemed a weary journey oftentimes. Thank God, my dear boy, that your boyhood was not left motherless."</p>
               <p>"I do, and I thank Him, too, for the sisters he has given me. I got a letter from Emmie this morning. Dear little Sunbeam, how happy she will be, that she can come to live with me at last. Such a little philosopher. The rest of the village girls, it seems, are having new bonnets, and she couldn't afford any. Her account of the display at their one milliner's shop, is really laughable. I believe I can afford to treat her to a present of a new bonnet on the strength of my recent good fortune."</p>
               <p>"To be sure you can. I'll pay you for all that copying you did for me, on that very condition, and I'll go with you and help select. Come, we shall both be at leisure for an hour or two. There must be one for each of them."</p>
               <p>They sauntered along Broadway in the very gayest spirits. At length Simon paused, and indicated a hat which had completely captivated his<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7298-00000119"/> fancy. "That's the very thing for little Sunbeam now, isn't it?" The bonnet in question was bright red, with flowers of a deep yellow. Dick could hardly suppress a hearty laugh, as he attempted to imagine Emmie's sweet, sunshiny face, and intelligent, brown eyes, with such remarkable surroundings; but he only said, quietly, that he was sure it wouldn't quite suit her complexion. In the very next window was one which he decided to secure, with the fullest approbation of the obliging Simon. It was white, with lining and strings of pale rose color, and plumes as soft and delicate as December snow-flakes. There was another of deep azure silk. He fancied it would just match the untroubled blue of Mabel's dream-haunted eyes; and he went home, the triumphant possessor of them both. He could never remember so happy a New Year, and yet he was only a merchant's clerk, on a small salary, alone in the great city, with no friends, save that one honest, kind-hearted man. He could not rest contented until he had coaxed Simon across South Ferry, and fixed on a half-dozen cost houses, any one of which he fancied would be a pretty nest for the home-birds who were to migrate thither with the spring sunshine. Long, and very eloquent with love and hope, was the letter he wrote that evening to the dear ones in Mohawk Village, while Simon sat silently by in his arm-chair, enjoying his young friend's happiness, and yet thinking half sorrowfully the while, of what might be, if he, himself, were not quite so old, and a little bit more handsome.</p>
               <p>It was New Year's also on Mount Vernon street. The seasons of the year are terribly republican in their character, and the day was not a bit brighter for our lady Juno, than for the tired beggar woman, resting for a moment on her steps, whom the quadroon had just before so haughtily repulsed. Juno was in her dressing-room. The dainty shutters of satin-wood, picked out with gold, were carefully closed, to exclude the sunlight, and the room was brilliantly illuminated with gas, for she wished to try the effect of the gaslight on a costume which must be worn late into the night. She sat with a cashmere dressing-gown falling in graceful folds about her, while her quadroon maid knelt at her feet, adjusting the tiny white satin slippers. Her robe for the occasion was a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">moire antique</foreign> white, with rippling waves of light all over it, and spotted here and there? as if dashed with dew-drops. Over this she was to wear a dress of Mechlin lace, exquisite in its pattern, and fine and soft enough for the coronation robes of a fairy queen. Dupont had given his most classic touches to her hair, and ornamented it with a wreath of delicate orange blossoms, manufactured with the purest oriental pearls set in silver. Her dress lay on the lounge before her, the little feet were properly <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chaussée,</foreign> and<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7298-00000120"/> the quadroon was ready for the completion of her task; but still Master Warren chose to linger, and still Juno looked up with her brightest smile to the handsome face bending over her. "But, mother dearest," he said, earnestly, "must you insist? Grace does not wish it herself, and it will be positive pain to me."</p>
               <p>"Pain to have your betrothed wife sit for callers with your own mother? "</p>
               <p>"You understand me, mother. You must surely know I love Grace too well, and appreciate her too highly, to be willing the scene of Christmas evening should be re-enacted."</p>
               <p>"It may not be; at any rate, the experiment is worth trying. If Miss Atherton is to be your wife, she must live here, and living here, she cannot seclude herself from society. That unfortunate story may perhaps be forgotten in time; at any rate, we must not seem to notice it. The poor child's manners are awkward to the last degree in society, and we must have her a little more accustomed to it, before she is introduced as your bride. Go now, I am waiting to dress; and please let her know it is my very earnest wish that she should be present in the drawing-room before eleven."</p>
               <p>All that week, the poor girl's heart had ached wearily. Her longed for summons home had not yet arrived, and more than ever her simple country habits seemed out of place among the magnificence with which she was surrounded. She listened to Mrs. Clifford's wishes with a sigh so deep it made Warren's heart ache. She was sitting in the library, and she rose to go up stairs. He sprang to her side, and drew her head impulsively to his bosom. But the action called no flush to her cheek, no sparkle to her eye, and he said, half reproachfully, "Grace, what ails you? What makes you so calm, and still, and cold? Are you sick? has any thing vexed you?"</p>
               <p>There was a mournful, pathetic look in the blue eyes which sought his own; a look which haunted him for years afterwards. "No," she said, very quietly,—"I am not sick; I am not vexed; I am <emph>lonesome.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And yet I am with you, Gracie," he said, reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"I know it, but I had rather you were with me at home. I am pining for Glenthorne. It is too stately for me here, I can't live; I'm a wild, mountain daisy, and I don't want to be put here with your fuchsias and French roses."</p>
               <p>You are ill. You never would speak so despairingly if you were not. I suppose you must go and dress; my mother is very much in earnest about it. But if you find the parade is tiring you, just steal away to your own room, and no one shall find fault."</p>
               <p>Even his tender words failed to gladden her, as they would have done two weeks before. Listlessly she went up stairs, and twined her golden tresses over<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7298-00000121"/> her finger. Then she put on a dress of deep azure silk. It was a simple costume, but very becoming to the almost ethereal style of her face and figure. When she descended to the drawing-room, she found Mrs. Clifford and Miss Sommers already surrounded by a group of gentlemen. Warren had lingered still in the hope of seeing her before he went out, and meeting her at the door, he conducted her to a seat beside a stand of choice engravings. For the first few moments she had leisure to look about her. Miss Sommers, elegantly arrayed in rose-colored satin, was playing the sentimental young lady, after the most approved fashion, to a young gentleman whose collar turned down à la Byron, and "eyes in a fine frenzy rolling," betrayed the incipient poet. She was just informing him what a very nice young lady she thought <hi rend="i"/>Leila, and how she had doted on brides, ever since she saw a certain distinguished actress appear in the costume of <emph>Miss</emph> Lammermuir. Juno was conversing with a distinguished looking man in military costume, and the other gentlemen, joining in the conversation only now and then, seemed sufficiently entertained by the reflection of their own faces in their patent-leather boots. The day passed very wearily. There were a few who took the trouble to talk to Grace, and there was no repetition of the insults of the Christmas evening. But she was too sad to be very entertaining, and at length, as if by a tacit consent, they abandoned her to her silence and her table of engravings. There was one which especially fascinated her. There were bleak, barren hills in the background, and over them the moon was rising, lifting her face, wan and spectral, from the black clouds folded round her. Then there was a chain of rugged rocks, against which the sea surged and dashed like mad, and on the cliff jutting farthest out to sea, stood a young girl. She was evidently a fisherman's daughter. Her face was very beautiful. Her loose cloak was blown backward, and so were the long folds of her hair. Her eyes were straining to catch a view of a far-off skiff, which had well-nigh gone to pieces in its battle with the waves. In her expression there was a strange blending of hope, and the most abject, miserable despair. The hope had almost gone out, and in the despair there was something strangely sublime. It was such a look as a lost angel might have worn, who had tried in vain to scale the steeps of Heaven. To Grace there was a prophecy in those troubled, mournful eyes. She turned it a dozen different ways, and in each new light it seemed to grow more and more drearily mournful. And so she sat, while the first sun of the New Year was going down slowly. She did not seem to comprehend any thing around. The voices did not enter her ear; the faces and figures might have been those of phantoms. Her soul was heavy with a dim, undefined presentiment of some terrible evil.</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7298-00000122"/>
               <p>Juno Clifford, sitting there, looking like a royal bride in her costly robes, watched her furtively and enjoyingly, while Miss Margaretta coined a sneer or two for her especial benefit; but they were both unheeded.</p>
               <p>The next morning a note with the Grlenthorne postmark roused her from the listlessness into which she was falling. Juno had declared herself too ill to appear at breakfast, and both Warren and Miss Ath-erton were sitting by her bedside, when the welcome missive was brought in.</p>
               <p>"I am going home to-morrow, she said, when she had concluded its perusal, and her tone had something of its old cheerfulness.</p>
               <p>"Not to-morrow, surely. Mr. Clifford leaves to-day for Washington, and I am so ill I would not dare to stay without Warren. You cannot go home alone."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, I shall have no difficulty; you know I came without him My mother has sent for me, and I must go."</p>
               <p>"But he fully intended to go with you."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, you need him more than I, and I shall do very well." At that moment Warmfs eyes met her own with a reproachful look, which seemed to say, "Has <emph>my</emph> presence ceased to be welcome?" She rose, and retreated hastily to her own room. She had a kind of feeling that Warren never looked at her without recalling the scene of Christmas evening, and this thought gave her a feeling of constraint. She longed to escape from it all, to her own free, happy home; and yet she loved him—he must have indeed been blind to doubt that—loved him with a love as eternal as the soul which conceived it. She read the precious letter over and over again, kissing the words, and blistering the paper with her tears. There were sentences, fairly eloquent with the gushing tenderness of a mother's love for her only child. They told of the fond welcome which awaited her—of the songs her pet birds sang in the winter mornings when she was not there to hear them; of the buds on her rose-tree, and of the good, kind Mary, so patient in her great sorrow; busy every where, but most of all in making her young lady's room look bright and neat. She must come—they were all ready, waiting for her, they should be so much happier when she was there. She pressed the loving words to her lips, and her heart overflowed with a tearful thanksgiving for this blessed place of refuge.</p>
               <p>Juno parted with her the next morning with many outward expressions of regret. Grace listened to her words, and was folded to her heart, as in a dream. She scarcely heeded Miss Sommers' half-mocking farewell, but she clung to Warren's arm almost despairingly, as he led her to the carriage. She had not realized, before, how terrible would be the parting. That hour she felt how far dearer was her betrothed husband, than all things earthly; dearer even than her<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7298-00000123"/> own life. During the short drive to the depot, there were but few words spoken. Her head lay silently upon his breast. There was time for but a hurried goodbye—a hasty promise to write often, to see her soon, and then, utterly regardless of the gazing eyes around him, he strained her for one moment passionately to his heart. Then he had a glimpse, as the cars started, of a pale, tearless face looking from the window with a weary, sorrowful glance, very pitiful in one so young. He went back into the presence of his fascinating mother, with that sad face haunting him; and reading the sorrow in his eyes, Juno Clifford began to realize that the game on which she hazarded all things was but a desperate chance.</p>
               <p>That afternoon, in Mohawk Village, a happy party were gathered round a blazing fireside, while Emmie Hereford read her brother's letter. She had tried on her new bonnet at least a half-dozen times, and extemporized as many dances before the mirror in her extravagant joy. Now she sat with her lashes demurely drooped, half veiling the sunshine in her brown eyes. "And so, mother dearest, we are to go to Dick next spring? Won't it be joy to live together again? Mabel will feel it most of all; and my Lady Juno Clifford can have back her cottage upon her hands." And the mother, answering, smiled with the tears dimming her kind eyes, and breathed a silent prayer that God would bless the absent son and brother.</p>
               <p>That afternoon, a white-haired man, unmistakably growing old, stood beside his gentle wife on the steps of Glenthorne Cottage. The stage stopped at the door, and a slight, pale girl came forward, and was folded in their arms. They showered tenderest kisses on the young, sad face; they breathed blessings over her; and Grace Atherton, coming back worn and wearied from her sojourn in the wondrous regions of UpTown, blessed God afresh for the love of home, akin to the love of heaven.</p>

               <head>XVII. CHECKMATED.</head>
               <p>WHEN Warren returned, Mrs. Clifford had not yet risen. He entered the room and sat down beside her, tenderly kissing her cheek. "You shall not see company again this year, darling mother, if it's going to make you so ill next day." His tone was playful, but there was deep anxiety in the look he bent upon her.</p>
               <p>"It was not that, Warren," she said, quietly.</p>
               <p>"Not that?"</p>
               <p>"No, the cause lay deeper. Warren, could you be happy if we were separated? We have been together now so many years—there would be so many memories of sorrows we hare shared—of pleasures we have experienced; nay, would not every twilight of the future echo with the evening hymns we have sung together?"</p>
               <p>"But why think of this, mother dearest, when such a thing can never be?"</p>
               <p>"Warren, do you love Grace Atherton?" She fixed her dark eyes upon his face with a searching look.</p>
               <p>"Surely I love her, she is my betrothed."</p>
               <p>"It would cost you more, then, to part with her, than with your mother?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell; in mercy do not ask me. It would be death or madness to do either,"</p>
               <p>"And yet answer me!"</p>
               <p>"How can I? Grace is so sweet, so gentle, she soothes me like pleasant music. You are different. Your dark eyes thrill me, kindle up my soul. I have known you longest—you are my mother."</p>
               <p>She twined her arm around his neck, and drew his head down on the pillow beside her. "Then you wouldn't leave me," she said in a gentle whisper, "not even if this dear Grace wished it?"</p>
               <p>"Never! Have I not sworn I would never leave nor forsake you? She could not wish it; if she did, I would cast her from my heart."</p>
               <p>Juno thanked him in a low, tremulous tone, and then she asked—"But, Warren, if you must give up one of us two; if my husband were to forbid the nuptials, and the marriage vows you plighted were to be your eternal sentence of banishment from, my presence, what would you do then?"</p>
               <p>"My duty, if God would help me to discover it. It would be a fearful choice, between breaking the young heart which has trusted me, and refusing obedience to the guardians of a lifetime, parting with you."</p>
               <p>"Think you that Grace Atherton, with her girl's<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7298-00000125"/> heart, could ever love you as <emph>I</emph> have loved?" Her tone was one of intense passion; her warm lips were against his cheek, and yet he dreamed not that it was other than a mother's sanctified tenderness of which she spoke.</p>
               <p>He answered earnestly—" Oh, mother, try me no farther. Such choice could never be. If it could, God help me; but it is wrong to think of anything so terrible, so impossible.</p>
               <p>"And yet, my own boy, it was this terrible fear which made me ill. John Clifford likes not your fair bride, and a few words he said made me down sick with fear lest all this lay before you."</p>
               <p>"But surely, mother, <emph>you</emph> could influence him."</p>
               <p>"I will try," she answered. Her face was lying so that Warren could not look upon it, but at that moment it wore the expression of a beautiful fiend.</p>
               <p>During the week that followed before John Clifford's return, Juno was lovelier than ever. Miss Margaretta had departed for her own home, in absolute despair of the success of her plans, and they were constantly together. "Warren seemed more and more to realize how impossible it would be to live without her. Even the absent Grace seldom came between them, save when he would rouse himself to write to her, or pause for a moment to read her words of purest love and trust. For the time being, his mother seemed to unite to her own proud beauty and unrivalled elegance, all sweet, unselfish purity which had most attracted in Grace. There was a shade of sadness m her which made them irresistibly charming.</p>
               <p>At length Mr. Clifford cam, Juno had laid her skilfully. She met him at the door, and rested her head on breast as she had not done more than once or twice in a life-time. He clasped her in his arms "I am so glad you have come," she whispered, I have been so anxious, I have needed you so muck He threw off his outside wrappings and followed her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir.</foreign> She sat down beside him, and for a moment there was silence. Then looking up she said, as if with a sweet, wife-like trust, "You <emph>do</emph> love me, John?"</p>
               <p>"Love you, my own wife, my beautiful angel; if you knew how gladly I would die for you."</p>
               <p>"I do know. It is a blessed thought that I will have your love to comfort me when my heart is fit to break."</p>
               <p>"Your Heart! My own love, what is this great sorrow?"</p>
               <p>"Is it nothing to be left childless? If Warren Clifford is Grace Atherton's husband, he cannot be my son."</p>
               <p>"Why not? he can bring her home. There need be no separation."</p>
               <p>She reached up, and twined her arm caressingly about his neck. "But I don't like her," she said,<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7298-00000126"/> eoaxingly—"It would make me very unhappy to have her here; and she don't like me, and wouldn't want to stay here. She got very home-sick, the little time she did stay. The result of the marriage would be that Warren would live in Glenthorne. I am sure of it."</p>
               <p>"That would be a trial, certainly. You would be very lonely now without his society, and I really need him about my business."</p>
               <p>"It would be more than a trial, my husband; it would <emph>kill</emph> me. I have only you and him in all the world; how can I spare either?"</p>
               <p>"You must not, but what can I do?"</p>
               <p>"Forbid it!"</p>
               <p>"But would that help the matter? Some young men would marry all the quicker."</p>
               <p>"It would not be so with Warren. His notions of duty are very high, and he would think it wrong to leave us. You would only have to be firm. Tell him if he weds her, he must never again enter our doors. That he must part with us for ever or with her. Let him think that you do not like her; that you would feel disgraced by her humble origin. He would be insane to go forth into the world portionless, with not even a profession. Loving her he would not link her to such a fate. For her own sake he would give her up."</p>
               <p>"But would he not suffer terribly?"</p>
               <p>"Trust that to me, my husband. I am too fond a mother, to wish him made unhappy. Their love, as yet, is not much beyond a mere fancy on either side. They would suffer very little, not half so much as you or I should grieve at parting with our boy. If worst came to worst, and he <emph>did</emph> marry her, we could take them back after a time. But there is not much danger of this, only be resolute. <emph>Will</emph> you do this for my sake?" The bewildered man had a half consciousness that he was promising to commit a sin before high Heaven, but he worshipped Juno. What could he say, when she was lying, as he had never before held her, in his arms, with those magnetic eyes burning into his very soul? He bent his lips to hers with a passionate fervor, and whispered the promise she had requested, as he held her to his heart.</p>
               <p>He was very persistent, naturally, and when he had once undertaken an object, was seldom known to fail. The next morning, Warren was summoned to a conference in his study. Juno Clifford heard the door close behind them, and sat in her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir</foreign> the while, in an agony of impatient expectation. It was nearly a half hour after, when Warren rushed in, and threw himself at her feet. "It has come," he exclaimed—"mother, I have got a blow." He buried his face in her lap, and his frame shook with those bursting sobs which are so terrible when the storm of some passionate grief o'ersweeps a manly nature. "Warren, darling," she whispered, laying her hand very tenderly<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7298-00000127"/> on his brown, clustering curls—"speak to me, my own boy. You frighten me!"</p>
               <p>He lifted his pale face, and struggled to speak calmly. "You were right, my mother. Oh help me not to be angry with him, not to forget how much I owe him. He would separate us. He hates my gentle Grace, and scorns the low descent, which he fancies would disgrace his proud name. He has told me that if I marry her I can be no child of his. I must go forth from your dear presence for ever. Oh, he was so cold and stern! Is there no hope?"</p>
               <p>She folded him in her arms, and hid her face upon his shoulder, and then she answered in trembling tones, as if she were sharing all his suffering—"There is none. I talked to him all last night, and when I cannot soften him, surely no other can. He does not think Grace Atherton truly loves you. He thinks she is dazzled by your father's wealth, and he will never forget the terrible misfortune of that Christmas evening."</p>
               <p>"He has given me two weeks to decide. He says he will not take my answer before. But what can I say? Dare I hope I could win my gently-nurtured Grace to be a poor man's wife, one bitterly poor as I shall be? And if she would, could I give <emph>you</emph> up, whom I so idolize? Mother, help me."</p>
               <p>"I cannot. It will kill me if you leave me. My heart returns but one answer, and yet I will try to council you. What if you should write to Grace, and ask her whether she would share your poverty, if you left your parents for her sake."</p>
               <p>"I will, this moment."</p>
               <p>"There is no hurry. It cannot leave Boston now until to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"I know, but I must do something. I shall feel better to have it written." He drew a writing desk toward him, and wrote for a time with nervous energy. Then he tossed the half-filled sheet to his mother. She looked over its contents. They were very contradictory. One paragraph would be filled with the passionate outpourings of his love for Grace; the next would picture vividly the clinging tenderness which bound him to his mother. Then there would be a startling prophecy of the poverty with which he so dreaded to darken her young life, concluding, perhaps, with a question whether they might not be wildly happy yet, with such deep love as theirs; whether any thing of suffering or penury would not be better than a separation which would go nigh to crush the life out of those two young hearts? And at the close he said—</p>
               <p>"Grace, I know not what I have written. I leave it all in your hands. Decide as you will. You know I love you. I have sworn before Heaven to love you always. Will you be my wife? If yes, I will go out from my father's house for your sake; and you shall be my world, but it will be a humble lot. We shall<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7298-00000128"/> both suffer much. It is for you to say wnetner your love shall be strong enough to lighten it. Write to me. I shall be wretched until I know my fate."</p>
               <p>Juno smiled faintly as she finished its perusal. Triumphantly she whispered to herself—"She will know at least that his heart has more than one idol." There was in it little of that exclusive devotion which could win a woman like Grace Atherton to consent to burthen him with poverty for her sake. She almost trembled lest he should not send it, for she foresaw with all its contradictions and inconsistencies it would be a valuable aid to her own plans. "Seal it now," she said, as she handed it back to him. "It is all right. She will say yes, if she loves you, and I—" She paused, and Warren turned away. He had not courage to meet the pleading agony in those lustrous eyes. The letter was sealed, and that night, when all the rest of the house were sleeping, Juno Clifford left her husband's side, and folding a shawl about her, sought her boudoir. Then she lit a little silver lamp, and sitting down at her own table, indited a letter to Grace Atherton's parents. She communicated her husband's conversation with Warren. She spoke deprecatingly of the sinful pride which made him unwilling to welcome Grace Atherton as his daughter. Humbly she begged them to forgive her the ungracious task she had imposed upon herself. Very sweetly she spoke of her own love for Grace, and then there was a perfect torrent of wild, passionate pleading, that they would pity the mother's heart, which clung so to her son. She told them she was writing, when all other eyes were closed, to pray them to have mercy not to permit her son to be taken from her, or she should go mad, or die. Would they use their influence with Grace; only persuade her to wait. It would all come right sometime. Mr. Clifford might change his mind by and by, or something might happen to bring them together. But if Warren left them now, and married indirect opposition to his father's will, there would be no hope of forgiveness, She would trust them, she said to keep her letter secret. She would not have it reach her husband's ears, or Warren's, but she could not refrain from writing. Sitting there alone, in the desolate midnight, she was weeping over the Sheet, to think what life would be, if he, her only one, were taken from her. When she had written the last sentence, she held it up to the light, and read it over. It was very skilfully worded to produce the desired effect. It could not fail to touch a parent's heart and it pictured vividly the destitution which would be their daughter's if she became Warren's wife against his father's will. A mocking smile sat upon her face, as she sealed it, and wrote the superscription. Then she proceeded with noiseless footstep to the sleeping apartment of the quadroon. "Jane," she said,<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7298-00000129"/> flashing the lamp in her eyes so as to awaken her, "Can you do an errand for me at daybreak?"</p>
               <p>The girl was fully aroused in a moment. "Yes, madam," she replied, unhesitatingly.</p>
               <p>"You know where the post-office is?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, I want to send this letter. It is very important it should go to-morrow, and that it should be kept secret from Warren and Mr. Clifford. I am setting you a hard task, but I can trust no one else. Will you undertake to put this in the morning mail?"</p>
               <p>"I will. It shall be there, surely and secretly."</p>
               <p>"Very well, I am sure that I can trust you." She turned and left the room. She did not hear the passionate murmur that followed her—" I would die for you, oh my mistress! I would steep my soul in the rivers of death, for one such caress as you bestow on your pet greyhound!" Nothing was more singular about Juno's character, than her power of inspiring attachment; and perhaps by none was she so madly worshipped as by her quadroon servant. With all the tropical fervor of her mixed blood, the girl adored the beautiful being whom, from childhood, she had been taught to obey and reverence. Her mother was dead, her brothers and sisters sold into hopeless slavery, and she clung to her mistress with a passionate devotion, compounded of all the good and evil in her nature, There was not a crime so black, she would not have stained her soul with its deadliest dye at that mistress's bidding, and yet Heaven's own angels were not purer than Juno Clifford might have made her, had she so willed. It was a human soul committed to her keeping, for which she would be called to answer, when "the judgment was set, and the books opened." Quietly, now that her task was done, Juno Clifford lay down by her husband's side. Well she knew want of rest would impair the fresh beauty she more than ever prized: and so she clasped those tiny hands upon her breast, and composed herself to sleep as calmly as if no evil thought had ever thrilled the heart which beat beneath. It was four days ere Grace Atherton's answer came—</p>
               <p>"I love you," thus she wrote, after a few words of kindly greeting.</p>
               <p>"I love you; I should belie my own heart, were I not to tell you that; but I cannot decide for you. The task you have imposed is too heavy. Had you been utterly penniless when you sought my love, I should have put my hand in yours, with a trust just as unfaltering; therefore I would not hesitate to share poverty with you now. I have never yet been rich, and a life of constant exertion has no terrors for me. I am young and active; I can work. But is it right? That is the question I have been asking myself all this weary night. You owe every thing to your parents; could I hope God's blessing if I took you from them,<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7298-00000130"/> if I induced you to disobey them? There is yet another question. What is simple Grace Atherton, that her quiet presence and her loving heart could atone to you for all you must give up? You have been surrounded with every thing glorious and beautiful in art and nature. The home we could make for ourselves must be a very humble one. You would miss the luxury which has grown to be almost a necessity of your existence. And then your mother. Oh, Warren, I can feel how, as week after week passed away and you could not see her, you would pine for her voice, her step, or the very touch of her fingers upon your hair. There would be the long twilights, when you could sing with her no longer,—the home-comings, when you could pause vainly for her welcome. With her you share the memories of a lifetime's tenderness. With me it is only one dream of love,—very bright indeed, but briefer, and it may be easier to forget. You shall decide, I will never blame you. Sometimes I think it is your <emph>duty</emph> to stay with them to whom you owe most. Let your own heart answer. If that should utter a cry which only my voice can answer; if without me life will indeed be desolate, then come hither and claim your bride."</p>
               <p>"Do you not see it al?" asked Juno, folding it up, after he had given it to her to peruse. "She does not like to give you up in so many words, rather than share your poverty, so she just intimates that your duty ought to keep you here, and sets before you very vividly the terrors of a life of poverty."</p>
               <p>Warren took the note from her hand. "I am not sure," he said, "that you have understood her. It seems to me that she is hoping I shall turn to her, only she wants me to see beforehand, what I will have to regret afterwards, and she is afraid of influencing me to do wrong."</p>
               <p>"Well, how will you answer?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all, until the last moment. I shall try to soften my father's heart. If I fail, I can but strive to see which way duty lies. It is a fearful struggle."</p>
               <p>"It will kill me if you leave me; I will not try to live."</p>
               <p>"And will it not break poor Grace Atherton's young heart, and wreck the whole future of her life, if I prove recreant to the vow which I swore, to cherish her for ever?"</p>
               <p>Morning after morning during the miserable ten days that followed, Warren was awakened at early dawn by a restless step keeping a ceaseless vigil before his door. The first time this happened, he was fairly startled, for no one in the house arose so early. He threw on a dressing-gown and opened the door. It was Juno. Her thin, white robes alone protected her against the cold; her black, dishevelled hair fell nearly to her feet, and she was walking to and fro, her hands tightly clasped, and her face bathed in tears.</p>
               <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7298-00000131"/>
               <p>He was frightened lest the madness she threatened had overtaken her. He sprang to her side. "Mother," he cried, "indeed you are beside yourself, here in this cold passage with these thin robes. You will die."</p>
               <p>"I hope so." Her tone was fearfully calm. "I am not mad, I am only wretched; I want to die since I foresee that you will leave me. Oh, Warren, was it for this I so cherished you? Have you decided?"</p>
               <p>"No, mother. I must not decide until the very last. There is a path of duty somewhere; I must have time to find it."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, go back to your bed. I can bear it alone, only do not send me off, I must stay here. I will not go. My child, my idol, if another has won you from me, I will be with you while I may. Even in your hours of sleep will I linger near you, and remember, when you go, you take my heart and my life with you."</p>
               <p>Morning after morning would that light step waken him from his troubled sleep—morning after morning he watched her in her despairing beauty, and listened over again to the same pleading tones, the same wild prayers. She had never seemed so lovely, as when, laying aside all pride, all conventional constraint and frivolity, she abandoned herself to her passionate woman's love and grief. He could not be insensible to such devotion. Was it strange if he grew to believe that the mother was dearer than the bride, to think that this woman, so glorious in her pride, and passion, and despair, loved him more deeply than the young heart whose earliest love-beat had syllabled his name?</p>
               <p>John Clifford had never been so happy as during this time of trial. Juno had easily persuaded him to believe that Warren's grief would be but of short duration, and fearful lest he should be induced, in spite of all, to accord his consent to the marriage, she maintained her ascendency by caresses so rare and precious, that they thrilled him with a fever of delight. Vainly, in the course of every day, Warren tried to soften the sternness of his resolution, and every day received a more decided negative.</p>
               <p>It was the last day of the appointed fortnight. Warren met his mother at the door of Mr. Clifford's study. She gave him a look of searching inquiry. "Do you go to tell him your decision?" she whispered.</p>
               <p>"No, to make one more attempt to soften his heart."</p>
               <p>Passionate were the pleadings he offered in his anguish, but John Clifford was steeled against them. His wife's kisses still lingered on his lips, and he must keep the compact they had sealed. She still stood near the door when Warren came forth. With an imploring gesture she laid her hand upon his arm.</p>
               <p>"Has he consented?" she exclaimed, eagerly.</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7298-00000132"/>
               <p>"No," was the bitter reply, "he has shown no mercy. I have humbled myself in vain."</p>
               <p>She threw herself on the floor at his feet, she clasped his knees, she plead with him not to leave her, to let her live. For a moment he lifted her in his arms. "Mother," he said, almost sternly, "this is wrong. Be calm. You should leave this matter to God and to my conscience." He led her to the boudoir, and throwing open the door passed from her presence. The hour that elapsed before his return, swept over her like an age of torture.</p>
               <p>At length he came. There were no traces of emotion on his face, save that it was pale as marble. He threw an unsealed letter into her lap. "There, mother," he said, slowly, "that is your work. You have triumphed. Seal it, and send it. I do not want it ever again mentioned in my presence."</p>
               <p>She raised her eyes, but she was again alone. She opened the letter and read it slowly out loud.</p>

                           <p>"I will call you so this once more. God help us, for He has separated us. I have no strength to tell you now how tenderly I have loved you. You know it but too well. Every glance of your blue eyes, every thread of your golden hair was dearer to me than my own life. I would not look upon your face for worlds, now that it is lost to me for ever. My mother has tried to soothe the agony of this parting. She has whispered that a time might come, when I would be free to marry you, but I have no such hope. I dare not dwell on it; it would be unjust, cruel. I cannot ask you to love me, to think of me. Rather let me pray you to forget me; to seek in some other love the happiness I can never again taste. May he who shall win and wear you, be more worthy of your love; he cannot return it more truly.</p>
                           <p>"You know me too well to dream that I could consider it a sacrifice to give up wealth and splendor for your sake; that would be so easy I should never give it a second thought. But it would be hard to ask you whom I so worship to share the hardships of a poor man's lot. I have prayed God, night and day for these two weary weeks, to guide my feet in the right way. I believe I have chosen it. My mother, to whom I owe all things, has clung to my knees entreating me not to leave her. I dare not disregard her prayers. I have written this calmly, but, Gracie, the struggle is driving me mad. Oh if it would but kill me. Then I could have some hope you would think of me lovingly. Standing over my grave you would forget that I darkened your young life with this heavy sorrow. Perhaps it will come, this merciful death. Oh, Grace, do not hate me! It is the only prayer I dare offer. Remember, after all, the sorrow falls heaviest on my own heart. God bless<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7298-00000133"/> you, God in heaven bless you, Grace, whom I hoped to call my wife! Farewell for ever, until I can come to your side in heaven."</p>

               <p>Proud and strong as was his manly heart, the letter was in many places blistered with his tears. Juno read it very calmly, with a mocking smile of triumph on her lips. Then she refolded it, and sealed it with the nicest care. Ringing for her footman, she ordered it taken to the office, and then adjusting her dress sat down to wait for Warren. All that evening she waited in vain. Twenty times during the night she knocked on his door and pleaded for admission, but received no answer; only through all the night she could hear his heavy sighs, and the quick, firm step pacing restlessly to and fro.</p>
               <p>It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Atherton entered the parlor at Glenthorne Cottage, with Warren's letter in his hand. Grace sprang to meet him, and broke the seal. Then sinking into a chair she exclaimed," Mamma, please read it, I cannot. Bead it all out loud, every word." She was obeyed. She listened calmly to the close, but her face grew deathly pale and her whole figure rigid, with the effort to suppress her emotion. When the last word was read, the single cry, "<emph>Lost!</emph>" burst from her lips, in a low, prolonged wail, and she fell senseless upon the floor. Tenderly her gray-haired father raised her in his arms, and bore her to the bed from which her young head was not lifted for many a week. With the child of their old age, their only one, lying pale and still and suffering before them, it was a hard lesson to forgive; but old Russel Atherton was a Christian, even in his sorrows, and together with the prayers for her recovery, he put up a petition that God would deal gently with him who had brought that bright head to the very brink of the grave, and kneeling at the bed's foot, the sorrowing mother whispered her low Amen.</p>
               <p>And so Juno Clifford triumphed, and the sweet child Grace, poor, innocent little player, was check <emph>mated</emph> in the great game of life.</p>

               <head>XVIII. LITTLE SUNBEAM IN THE CITY.</head>
               <p>DICK had secured a very comfortable house for his mother and sisters, and, for two or three weeks, had spent all his leisure in arranging it, of course assisted by the indefatigable Simon. There was a pleasant little sitting-room, which was to be Emmie's own. Not that it was designed for the sole use of the little lady, but Mr. Goldthwaite had insisted on furnishing it himself, in accordance with his own notions of her taste. In this undertaking he had met with excellent success. The room was really charming. The walls were hung with light, delicate paper, and two or three paintings were scattered around, bright, sunny landscapes, with cattle wading knee-deep in limpid streams, or lying under the trees, in the long grass of the meadow. In one corner stood a small but sweet toned piano; in another, a well filled bookcase. There was a cushioned easy chair for Mabel at one window, a stand of green-house plants at another, and at the pleasantest one of all was a little low rocking-chair, a working-table, and writing-desk, which were evidently Emmie's own. There was a nook for Mrs. Hereford, the very picture of comfort, a cosy sofa, and a dozen graceful, womanly trifles, which no one would have suspected Simon of having taste enough to select.</p>
               <p>They had written to Mrs. Clifford a grateful letter, returning her house and ground and declining for the future her proffered annuity. It had been kindly answered, but no allusion had been made to Warren. Dick had vainly endeavored to persuade Mr. Goldthwaite to become a member of their family, but he persisted in remaining in his bachelor quarters, though he promised to be a frequent visitor. They were expected on the morning of the middle of May. They were to come down the Hudson in the night-boat, so as to have a whole day in which to get quietly settled in their new home. Dick had secured leave of absence for the day, and Simon had promised to make his appearance in the evening.</p>
               <p>He had arrayed himself for the occasion in an entire new suit. It presented, however, the usual appearance at the wrists and ankles, of having been made for some one a few inches shorter than himself. He had inflicted such unparalleled tortures on his obstinate tresses, that they were, if possible, in a still sterner state of antagonism than usual. He had never been known before to manifest such unheard of anxiety about his personal appearance. He had actually<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7298-00000135"/> done his best; though, if the truth must be told, after all his exertions, he didn't "handsome much." He was confident he should know Emmie at the first glance, and he had thought of several very fine sounding sentences with which to address her. At precisely eight o'clock he rung the bell, and Dick himself came to the door in high spirits. Poor Simon! Never had he felt more inclined to beat a retreat, and yet he would not have failed to see Emmie Hereford's sunny face for a year's salary. In his confusion he quite forgot to leave his hat in the hall, and hastily put it down on the sofa, near the door of Emmie's own room, whither he was ushered. "This is Sunbeam," said Dick's cheerful voice. Never was poor bachelor more bewildered. Sure enough, there she was, right before him, her brown hair neatly braided, her blue dress fitting trimly to her light little figure, her brown eyes overflowing with merriment, and her lips with smiles. There she was, but what to say to her was the question; he had forgotten every one of his speeches. Her plump little hand was extended. Was it possible that he was permitted to clasp those white fingers in his own? He could have gone down on his knees on the spot, from excess of gratitude. Mrs. Hereford came to his relief with her kind, motherly welcome, and her cordial gratitude for all his kindness to her dear boy; and then another tiny hand was extended, and a voice, musical as those one hears in dreams, said, gently, "Brother Dick's friend won't forget Mabel?"</p>
               <p>He retreated to the sofa, as soon as the first civilities were over; but he was somewhat puzzled at Emmie's very evident attempt to restrain the mirth, which, in spite of herself, would dimple the corners of her pretty mouth. "Excuse me, Mr. Goldthwaite," she said, quietly, "you are sitting on something."</p>
               <p>"The kitten!" he exclaimed, springing from his seat in an agony of terror, but it was simply his own hat, which he had demolished.</p>
               <p>"That new beaver!" observed Dick, with a most lugubrious expression. The poor hat had evidently come to its end, annihilated "at one fell swoop;" but the hearty laugh which followed was worth ten hats, and somehow, in spite of the awkwardness of the incident, poor Simon felt infinitely more at home. He spent a delightful evening, and departed with the promise of seeing them at least once a week.</p>
               <p>As the days passed on, Dick declared that he had never known what home was before. Emmie was housekeeper, and she carried sunshine with her wherever she went. She could have "made home and hold out of four bare walls." No wonder that Simon Groldthwaite sighed, as he watched those graceful household ways, and listened to the love tones that made every word she spoke sound like a caress.</p>
               <p>She came to the store very often in the warm,<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7298-00000136"/> pleasant days, it was such a nice walk for Mabel. Crossing the ferry was a perpetual delight to the blind girl. She would push back her bonnet for the sea-breeze to fan her brow, and sit and dream that she saw great ships in the distance, with all their crews of bold mariners. The two fair English girls were objects of great interest to all the clerks; and there was one, Stephen Montford, who managed never to be too busy to constitute himself Emmie's messenger to the little room where her brother sat with his books, and found a rich reward in her timid smile and word of quiet thanks.</p>
               <p>About this time there was a new comer to the store, a young man named Harry Cunningham, who had been recommended to the firm as a superior salesman. There was something in his pleasant smile, and his frank, open face, that attracted Dick at once, and a few days sufficed to make them friends. He had been there about two weeks, when one evening Dick came home earlier than usual. "Mr. Goldthwaite is coming over," he said, cheerfully. "He will have to take my place to-night, for I've promised to go over to Cunningham's. He wants me to give him lessons in penmanship; he writes a wretched hand now, and he is trying to improve it, so he can get copying from the lawyers to do out of hours. He has a sister, and they two keep house over in Williamsburg. Their mother died when they were mere children, and they lost their father a few months since. He had lived beyond his income, and left them poor; but up to that time the sister had been accustomed to every luxury, and it cuts Harry to the heart to see her suffer privations now. I hope he will get on with the copying, for his salary is only five hundred a year."</p>
               <p>The humble lodgings where the brother and sister lived together, had an air of taste and refinement, in spite of their simplicity. You could see every where the graceful feminine touches, from the fall of the curtains to the moss vases they had preserved as relics of their country home. And Kate Cunningham shone upon her brother's friend as a revelation. She was such a type of the sweet woman nature as he had never before met. Not purer or truer than his sisters, for that would have been impossible; but very different. One of those women, such as we read of in stories and legends, whom you might expect to do and dare all for the beloved one. She could not have been more than seventeen, but her figure was very full in its outline, and displayed to excellent advantage by the closely fitting mourning dress of black bombazine. She was a brunette. Her dark and glossy tresses fell in natural curls almost to her waist. Her features were any thing but regular, yet her face was singularly expressive, with the broad, low brow, the intelligent hazel eyes full of fire and passion, and the crimson cheeks. Dick's female acquaintances had never extended<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7298-00000137"/> tended very far beyond his own roof-tree, and the young and lovely girl thrilled his heart, as when one sees for the first time a beautiful picture. But it was a nobler face than painter ever limned. You could read there quick scorn for wrong, strong love, and woman's holiest heritage of unsoiled purity Young Cunningham's voice had an intonation of pride when he said—"My sister Kate," which Dick thought extremely pardonable.</p>
               <p>The lesson in penmanship was very successful; the scholar was quick, and the teacher both patient and persevering, with those dark hazel eyes furtively watching him from the sewing-chair over opposite.</p>
               <p>Indeed he must have taken a very praiseworthy interest in his friend's progress, for he became a frequent visitor. Miss Cunningham was soon desirous of sharing in the benefit of his instructions. Dick thought, in his secret heart, nothing else could possibly be so charming as that light, graceful chirography, looking as if the little hand had skimmed the paper as daintily as the wing of a humming-bird. But he wouldn't have expressed this opinion for the world. It was such a pleasure to teach her. It gave him such excellent opportunities to prison the little fingers in his own, now and then, and look across the copy book into the hazel eyes. There was a kind of proud, defiant grace about her, an evident superiority to her circumstances, which was one of her chiefest charms. Had she been a princess of the realm, she could not have kept herself more charily.</p>
               <p>He had urged the point for weeks, before he succeeded in persuading her to accompany her brother, and spend an evening with his mother and sisters. But when once she came among them, she appeared very happy. She seemed to love Mrs. Hereford from the first glance, and the kind-hearted Englishwoman could not fail to be charmed with her frank innocence. They were a picture for a painter—Dick's mother sitting in her high-backed chair, her silver-gray hair put smoothly back under her widow's cap, and her muslin kerchief folded, with quaker-like precision, over her black silk dress, and the young girl sitting on a low stool at her feet, with the lamplight falling on her flushed cheeks, her waving curls, and her sparkling eyes. It was a pretty sight too, at least Simon Goldthwaite seemed to think so, to see the little Emmie flitting here and there, busied in her gentle, housewifely cares, for her guests' comfort. "You will come very often," said Mrs. Hereford, kindly, as they parted. "You have no mother, and I shall call you one of my children." A quick flush crimsoned Kate Cunningham's neck and brow, and then her dark eyes filled with tears. She bent reverently over the hand that clasped her own and pressed it to her lips. "You could not make a motherless girl so happy," she said, in a low whisper.</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7298-00000138"/>
               <p>That night, after his mother and Mabel had retired, Dick stood before the mantle for a few moments in silence, with his arm thrown around Emmie's waist. "Well, Sunbeam," he said, after a time, drawing her closer to him, "what do you think of Harry Cunningham's sister?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, she is charming, lovely. I wish she was mine."</p>
               <p>He lifted her little round face in both his hands, and as he bent forward to give her a good-night kiss, whispered, earnestly—"<emph>So do I!</emph>"</p>

               <head>XIX. THE FAR-OFF LAND.</head>
               <p>SOMETIMES the fulfilment of our dearest wishes comes to us like a curse. For twelve long months had Warren Clifford been separated from his Grace, and Juno had been waiting wearily for the "old man's" slow feet to reach the shore of the dark river of death. For a long time Warren had seemed like one who walks in his sleep. He had eaten and drank, performed all the duties of life, and complied passively with her wishes, all the while with a strange glitter in his eye, and a stern composure of manner, which to that passionate woman was almost fearful. But for some months he had seemed quite himself again, albeit between him and his Adopted father there was a scarcely perceptible shadow of coldness. To Juno he was tenderly affectionate as ever, and even more lively in general society than before, but never had Grace Atherton's name crossed his lips.</p>
               <p>It was Christmas, and the three sat together over<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7298-00000139"/> their five o'clock dinner. The gas had been lighted, and a flood of radiance streamed downward over the massive silver plate and sparkling Bohemian glass of the dessert service. Rich purple grapes lay piled up on vases of crystal, rare old Rhenish mantled the antique goblets, and you might have deemed it all the work of an enchanter, so costly and unique were the appointments of that sumptuous board. And no unworthy Circe might have been the proud woman at its head. No mantling wine was deeper in its glow than the crimson on her cheek; no jewels, were they worth a prince's ransom, brighter than her flashing eyes; and not even the queen of the genii could have worn a robe more fitting than that velvet, vieing in its purple tint with the rare hue of the Tuscan grapes. She alone, of those three at the board, had quaffed deep draughts of the sparkling Rhenish. With her clear head and strong nerves, it only gave her a wilder, freer sense of life, and sent the blood tingling to her rosy finger tips with a warmer glow. A cup of clear water stood at Warren's side, and before Mr. Clifford an untasted glass of champagne.</p>
               <p>"You are very still, both of you," she said, in her soft, silvery tones. "One would think there was a skeleton at the feast. Pledge me in that bright champagne, John Clifford, if you like not my Rhenish. Here's to your very long life, my lord and master!"</p>
               <p>He raised the glass to his lips, but a spasm of sud den agony contracted his features, and he set it down again untasted. His face grew wan and ghastly as the face of death, and he sank to the floor, strong man as he was, powerless, senseless, helpless. "Is he dead?" cried Juno, pale with terror. In that moment, even her haughty soul was humbled. She closed her eyes to shut out the sight she dared not look upon, and before them passed horrible visions of retribution. Hourly and daily she had wished him dead, and now Satan had sent an answer to her prayer. She could almost feel upon her cheek the breath of flame seething upward from the pit. An hour seemed to have passed, though in reality it was but a moment, before Warren, who had lifted his head from the carpet, answered, "No, mother, he is not yet dead. It is apoplexy." The servants bore him up stairs and laid him on the bed, where she had rested so many nights beside him, wishing and longing for his death, and she went after them, shuddering. All that night he lay in a profound trance, so fearfully like death. Dr. Greene, standing over him, sorrowfully shook his head, and doubted whether the flickering life-flame would not go out without word or sign; Warren, condemning himself bitterly for every cherished thought of coldness or reproach toward his father, his benefactor, knelt by his bedside, praying wildly, imploringly, that he might live long enough to assure him of his forgiveness; and Juno paced to and fro in the next room,<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7298-00000140"/> like a chafed lioness, cursing in her passionate heart the tie that bound her to him, the husband that lay dying; and, more than all, this fearful answer to her prayer. Sometimes her reason seemed forsaking her. She would deem the quadroon, who sat crouching in one corner, with her shadow-like face and flashing eyes, an avenging fiend sent to haunt her; and seizing her fiercely would seem about to hurl her from the room. Then, reassured by her tones, she would plead with the girl not to leave her, not to let her stay there alone with her old friend, Satan.</p>
               <p>And yet when, with the sunrise, life and reason seemed coming back to the husband of her youth, she experienced a shock of something like indignation.</p>
               <p>Underlying all her guilty fear and tumult, there had been a secret joy and exultation, of which she herself was scarcely conscious, in the near hope of being Warren Clifford's wife, "What if he should get well enough to torment me for years longer?" she asked herself, angrily, as he opened his eyes and gasped forth with difficulty "Where is she—Juno?" Then smoothing her furrowed brow, she came and knelt down at the bedside, and pressed his hand to her lips. For a whole week, the scales seemed trembling the balance between life and death. Hating him more and more every hour, she yet forced herself to sit by his bedside, and abandon her hand to his passionate clasp; for she would not have Warren, watching over him ceaselessly and tending him so lovingly and gently, deem <emph>her</emph> heartless. In the first moment of comparative ease, when once more the light of reason beamed from the sufferer's eyes, Warren had knelt beside him and pleaded for forgiveness for every shade of coldness, every accusing thought; and the sick man, blessing him, had whispered, "You had cause, Warren, bitter cause; may God forgive me if I was wrong,—God, who knows I meant it for the best.</p>
               <p>It was the seventh day at noon. For many hours John Clifford had been passing from one spasm to another, and at last Dr. Greene had succeeded, by a powerful opiate, in soothing him to a profound sleep. Warren had left the room, and Juno said, entreatingly, as one should speak who pleaded for the life dearest on earth, "Dr. Greene, answer me truly, are these spasms fatal? is there no hope?"</p>
               <p>The doctor, good, innocent soul, looked, with a glance of profound pity, into the wild, passionate eyes raised so imploringly to his face, and answered, kindly, "I dare not promise. The spasms are not so bad a sign. He may recover. I can tell better when he rouses from this sleep. I must leave him now, but will return in a half-hour."</p>
               <p>"Oh, doctor, save him," she murmured, clasping her hands in agony most skilfully feigned,—and Dr. Greene<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7298-00000141"/> went home, and told the wife who had shared his own life's pilgrimage with the love and truth of a pure woman, that he wished he could be loved and grieved for like his wealthy patient; and she, gentle wife, tender mother, let fall a quiet tear upon her knitting, and raised a silent prayer that it might be long ere she should have such bitter cause to grieve.</p>
               <p>Standing there alone by her husband's bedside, Juno drooped her lashes over her eyes, and brooded upon Dr. Greene's prediction. "He might recover, and she might lose the love which had seemed so nearly in her grasp, the love for which she had perilled her salvation. And then the fierce hatred which had been growing more and more bitter for years, surged up in her heart. She had been a fool ever to marry him, she said to her unquiet soul. How could she have given her young life to that coarse old man. True, he had been kind to her, but had she not paid for it, aye and dearly, by submitting to his caresses. Was not every kiss he bestowed on her so utterly abhorrent that she would sooner have clasped a reptile to her bosom, and yet she had borne it. Was not that enough? And now it seemed he might get well, to plague her, perhaps, for half a century. She drew her breath hard—she bit her lip till it bled—she clinched her hands till the nails pricked through the delicate skin—and then the sentence burst forth—"<emph>I hate you, John Clifford; oh, I</emph>
                  <emph>hate you, and I wish you were dead!</emph> "Every word had fallen from her lips, full, distinct, clear, filling the room with its utterance. And then there was silence. She paused as if almost expecting a judgment. She had never dared before to say those words aloud, but John Clifford slept on steadily. The sunshine came through the windows, weaving meshes of light in his hair, the flowers in the vases on the mantle gave forth their delicious perfume as before, and seeing that "all things remained as they were," the lady smiled mockingly.</p>
               <p>At that moment the quadroon put away the curtains from the other side of the bed, and came forth into the light. "You are safe with me, my mistress," she said, in her low, flute-like tones—"but it might have been another. Be careful." At any other time Juno would have rebuked her severely for the insolence of advising, but she said nothing now, and the girl passed from the room.</p>
               <p>It was two hours before Mr. Clifford awoke, calm, and apparently free from pain. Dr. Greene was bending over his bedside. "Well, Doctor," he said, "I want to hear the truth, can I recover?"</p>
               <p>Juno had thought the reply would be in the affirmative. To her unpractised eye he seemed much better, but she listened with impatience for the answer. "No, Mr. Clifford, at farthest you have not more than a week to live. You had better make<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7298-00000142"/> your peace with God, for I dare not say hope, when there is no hope."</p>
               <p>"He has been my friend from my youth up, and he will not forsake me now," said the sick man, solemnly; "but my poor wife; Warren, you will guard her?"</p>
               <p>"With my life," was the reply, and John Clifford seemed satisfied.</p>
               <p>For two or three days, that luxurious room was like the gate of heaven, God must have sent his own angels, surely, to comfort that heart, so strong, so hopeful in its undimmed faith. The soul seemed waiting on the threshold of its prison-house, making its peaceful preparations for a long journey. "It is a far off land," he would say, lying there quietly—"you know the promise, Warren; <emph>He</emph> said it many, many years ago; he left it as his legacy—'Thou shalt see the King in his glory, and the land that is very far off."</p>
               <p>He was not afraid, for One stood by him—One whom only his eyes could see, the "<emph>fourth man</emph>" who trod the fiery furnace with the three holy children. And as he lay upon the tide, drifting ever farther away from earth and nearer heaven, his soul clung to Juno with a yearning fondness, very different from the passionate worship which had hitherto deemed her faultless. Much of the cold pride of her character seemed softened away in the near presence of that death which was to bring her freedom. She was very tolerant of his fancies, now that she knew they could trouble her but a few days longer. She would submit to his wish to have her near him, from morning until night, sitting on a low stool by his bedside. There he would lay his hand upon her shining hair, and look into her face with such mournful tenderness, as brought the tears to Warren's eyes, and murmur, "Oh, if I could but know you would surely come after me to the far-off land, it wouldn't be such a hard wrench to leave you. You must see the King's face in peace, my darling, and the Beautiful City. <emph>Very</emph> far off, isn't it? but it won't seem so far when angels bear you." And then he would be silent for a time, looking at her thoughtfully, lovingly sometimes, and sometimes watching the lights and shadows on the walls, and ever on the tide of the unseen sea he kept <emph>drifting outward.</emph> Standing on the shore, Warren thanked God that the heaven-bound voyageur was at peace, that there were no wild struggles to return to the land he had left, no idolatrous longings for the false gods of earth.</p>
               <p>And very peacefully the day dawned that was to be his last. When its earliest rays stole through his window, he well knew that he should never behold its setting, that ere then he would have drifted very far beyond the stars. And yet so peacefully he smiled, so cheerfully he spoke, you might have fancied him a wanderer going home, where fond kiss of wife, sweet voices of children, kind eyes of sister and brother<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7298-00000143"/> should bid him welcome. For him no more Yule logs should be kindled at the Christmas tide, no more south winds would woo him all the summer long—in the house whither he was going snows never fall, and noontides never beat. The sounds and sights of earth fell very dimly on the eyes watching the Distant Hills of Heaven; the ears strained to listen to the far-off chants of angels. And yet his love clung to Juno still. Fairer she looked that hour to the eyes grown dim with watching, than when he had clasped her to his heart a bride. Alas, he dreamed not that she had never loved him all those years. "It will be very hard, I know, darling," he said, stroking her hair with the old, passionate fondness, "harder for you even than for me. I go to the home <emph>He</emph> has prepared for me, to the blessedness of that great Peace; I leave you to battle with the troublesome world. You will be very lonely, poor child, with no friend but Warren, but I will pray God's love may rest on you." Toward noon, he seemed to sink into a drowse, though he started from it many times, and murmured some broken words about the land whither he was going. He was fully aroused at length by a paroxysm of intense pain. His partners, who had trusted so many years to his cool judgment and unclouded intellect, stood by his bedside weeping like very children. Dr. Greene and a brother physician were striving to lighten his sufferings; and Warren stood beside him, earnestly estly clasping his hand. At a little distance was Juno, very calm, very composed; and those men, his sorrowing friends, thought it but the calmness of despair. His thoughts seemed busy for a moment with the cares he was leaving behind for ever. "The will," he gasped, brokenly—"destroyed! India cabinet in study—right one!"</p>
               <p>"Do not try to think of that, you must not," said Dr. Greene, in a tone of authority. Submissively as a child he complied, and shut his eyes, ceasing for the time his efforts to speak. When those words were uttered the quadroon had seen a quick gleam of intelligence, a look of evil triumph kindle her mistress's face, but now she beheld her lie fainting upon the floor. "Bring her to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir,</foreign> he must not see her so," she exclaimed, in a low tone, springing to the door. The two men, John Clifford's partners, raised his wife in their arms and followed. Laying her down on a sumptuous lounge, they stood near, while the maid bathed her temples and chafed her hands. At first, she too had thought the well-acted swoon a reality, but now she felt a cautious pressure from the hand she held, and then she said, imploringly, "Oh please to go back to Mr. Clifford. He will die, and I can recover my mistress so much better alone. I am used to these turns whenever she is excited—I must unfasten her dress."</p>
               <p>They readily obeyed Jier, for their own deepest<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7298-00000144"/> anxiety was with the dying, and when the door closed behind them she whispered, "We are alone, my mistress."</p>
               <p>Juno raised her head. "Will you serve me at my need, faithfully?" The quadroon bowed. "Well then, hark. Here is the key to John Clifford's study, and this one will unlock his cabinet. I must have Warren in my power. He shall be left without a penny. No one could tell which will Mr. Clifford said was destroyed. Here is one which gives me <emph>all.</emph> Take it; unlock the cabinet, and secure the other; leave the old will there, and return. Lock the cabinet and the room. You understand me, go! If any one is here when you come back, you will know how to invent an errand." The girl took the parchment. She glided out of the room and up the stairs with her stealthy, cat-like step. Juno, meantime, sank languidly back upon the couch, in an attitude befitting one but just aroused from a deathly swoon. The quadroon was not absent more than three minutes, but they seemed like hours to the eager watcher. She came back and drew from her pocket another sealed parchment, precisely like in its appearance to the one she carried away. Juno tore it open. It bequeathed one hundred thousand dollars to "Warren Clifford, born Hereford." She smiled exultingly. "Jane," she said, quietly, "stand at the door and see that no one surprises me." Then rising, she walked deliberately to the grate, and tearing the parchment into strips, threw them one by one upon the embers.</p>
               <p>John Clifford was indeed dying. Never more sun of earth might light up his silver hair. For a time he was silent. Then he called on the wife who was not there to hear him. His glazed eyes could take no note of her absence. "Juno, darling, conic nearer," he whispered, in fond, caressing tones. "You have been a true wife, and though others might have been more worthy, none could have loved you more than I. The God of our fathers bless you, my beloved. May He deal with you lovingly, even <emph>as you have dealt with me!</emph>" Could a curse more bitter have been invoked on the guilty woman, who was at that very moment watching the flames close around the stolen will? "It is very near now, that other shore," he said once more, a beautiful light breaking like heavenly sunshine over the features growing cold in death. "Are you weeping, darling? Bend over, let the tears fall on my face, and clasp my hand tighter," and Warren bent sobbing above him, not daring to grieve that dying heart by the faintest whisper that the wife of his idolatry was not with him at the last. He made a sign as if he would have her press her lips to his, and bending lower still, Warren received that kiss—so wild, so passionate, the last. And so it was the <emph>imaginary-wife,</emph> the dream of his earlier years, who went with him into the dark valley<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7298-00000145"/> ley; and the woman for whom he would have perilled all things, heard not, heeded not the farewell of that love which had outlived every thing earthly in the true heart that nourished it. John Clifford was dead!</p>
               <p>And Juno, now that the last fragment of the will was consumed; now that her tones could fall only on the ears of the dead, rushed into the room, as if half wild with grief, threw herself on the bed beside him, and buried her face in his bosom.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XX. RETRIBUTION.</head>
               <p>THE dead man was buried with much of meaningless pomp and parade. Sable plumes nodded over his hearse, and a long procession of fashionable carriages followed him to his last rest, in peaceful Mount Auburn. Where they had scooped away the snow to dig his grave, there were one or two hardy young shoots of green, which had been struggling upward underneath it, harbingers of the blest spring that should rise out of its winter shroud—symbols of the soul's resurrection. Warren pointed them out to his mother with filling eyes. They had come together to the burial, riding in their closed carriage next to the hearse, and all the way Juno had lain sobbing upon his bosom, and Warren, soothing her, never dreamed that she wept for very joy that she was so folded to his heart—that the husband was dead, who she deemed had so long stood between her and happiness. But she wore the very deepest mourning, and every body so pitied "poor Mrs. Clifford" in her "terrible bereavement<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7298-00000146"/> ment." The rector put up a special prayer for her benefit, and she wept on, looking very beautiful through the black crape.</p>
               <p>It seemed lonely, even to her, when she went back, after the funeral, into the silent house, whence the dead had been borne forth so solemnly. There were few words spoken that evening. Warren mourned for the departed, with a deep and heartfelt grief, and ever striving to seem what he most approved, Juno was forced to assume its semblance. It was lonely, too, that night, tossing on the restless couch; where for so many years he had lain beside her; where now she must lie, with only the spectres of the past reproaching her ceaselessly.</p>
               <p>An early day had been appointed to read the will. Carefully John Clifford's cabinet had been sealed, the very hour of his death, and the seals were broken in the presence of witnesses. Good Dr. Greene was present at the reading, and so were all who had stood beside the lost one's death-bed. The lawyer, who had been for many years his attorney, looked around with a face of blank astonishment, as he read the sentence bequeathing the whole estate of the deceased, fully and unconditionally, to his wife Juno. He put it down, and taking off his spectacles, said, with an air of quiet determination, looking Juno full in the face, "I had the honor to draw up a will more recent than this."</p>
               <p>Not a muscle of her face moved; no slightest change of color gave token of emotion—she merely answered, as if the whole affair were a weariness, "Yes, surely there was one, my husband showed it to me. It gave Warren a large amount, a hundred thousand, I believe."</p>
               <p>"It did, and this will is dated nearly twenty years earlier,"</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon," interrupted Dr. Greene, "Mr. Clifford said something just before his death of having destroyed a will; without doubt it was that one. At any rate he said we should find the right one in his cabinet, and the cabinet was sealed within a half-hour after his death."</p>
               <p>"Urn—m—m!" answered the lawyer, musingly; "it is very strange. He was so anxious to have that will drawn, He said it was to remedy an act of injustice. I don't understand it."</p>
               <p>"But I do," said Warren, who had not before spoken. "There was a very important difference of opinion between my father and myself, about a year ago, and it produced a coldness which lasted until his last sickness. I understand it all, but I had not thought I had angered him so severely."</p>
               <p>Juno slid her hand into his very quietly. "I am sorry," she whispered; "but all that I have is yours, so it can really make no difference."</p>
               <p>And so the successful schemer triumphed yet once<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7298-00000147"/> more, and she was left in undisputed possession of her husband's splendid fortune.</p>
               <p>A year passed very quietly. Warren seemed more than ever careful of his mother's happiness, now that there was the new sense of protection, now that he felt he was indeed her all. They had lived since John Clifford's death solely for each other. It would have been contrary to Up-Town etiquette for the lady to go into society with her widow's weeds, in this first year of mourning. It was still more contrary to her inclination. Her passionate love for Warren grew every day more absorbing, and though the time was not yet ripe for its open manifestation, she managed to make him almost constantly her companion. Six weeks before the anniversary of her husband's death, he was obliged to leave her. Some extensive business transactions were to be settled up in the South and West, which none understood so well as he. He parted with her very reluctantly. "Nay, mother darling, do not weep so," he whispered, as she clung sobbing to his bosom. "I know you will be very lonely, but I shall write so often, you will have scarcely time to miss me, and I shall be with you before <emph>that</emph> day; I could not let you keep that alone."</p>
               <p>"But this parting is breaking my heart, and you do not suffer," she said, lifting her chiding eyes.</p>
               <p>"Do I not? How ill you read me. I am striving to be calm for your sake. Oh, my mother, you are all I have now—all—we are every thing to each other." He clasped her for a moment to his heart, in one straining, convulsive pressure, then hurriedly putting her from him, he left the house. During the whole six weeks of his absence, she brooded over that parting. She would sit for hours recalling every look, every tone, and then those wild passion-throbs would come back again which had so thrilled her, when he clasped her to his breast, and she would press her hand upon her heart, and blush like a timid girl. His letters were very frequent, and she treasured them lovingly in her bosom. Her manners to all around grow strangely sweet and gentle. She would lie on her couch for hours, weaving vague, delicious fancies of future happiness, making the quadroon sing to her low, sweet ballads of olden love. Warren's affairs detained him longer than he expected. Christmas came and went without him; New Year, and it was the day before the anniversary which brought even to her heart a nameless terror. It was mid-afternoon, and a footman, entering, presented to her the evening mail, on a silver salver. She seized it eagerly. There was a paper directed to Warren, and a letter in his hand. She lingered long over the letter. It was full of affection, and the concluding words made her heart thrill tumultuously. They said—</p>
               <p>"The day after to-morrow, my own mother, I shall<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7298-00000148"/> be with you. Forgive me that I cannot come before, but that day will be the return of much of sadness and trial. I cannot reach you until afternoon, but I will at least share part of it with you. Oh, what an age it seems since our last meeting! I am pining to listen to your voice, to look into your eyes." The letter had been twenty-four hours on its way. The next afternoon, then, he would be with her. Oh, he did love her, he must. She pressed the fond words he had written caressingly to her lips, to her bosom. Then she opened the paper. A marked passage caught her attention in a moment. It read thus:—</p>
               <p>"Married, Dec. 25th, at Glenthorne Cottage, by the Rev. Joseph Seaton, Malcom Hastings, Esq., to Miss Grace Atherton, both of Glenthorne."</p>
               <p>"Surer than ever," she murmured, triumphantly. Then she touched her little silver bell. Tinkle, tinkle, the sweet tones rung through the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir,</foreign> and ere they ceased, the quadroon stood before her. "Sit down, Jane," she said, very gently, pointing to the cushions at her feet. Then there was a moment of silence, during which she twined the girl's long, silken tresses about her fingers. It was curious to see how gentle her great happiness made her. No young girl, in the flush of her first love dream, was ever sweeter. At length she spoke. "Jane, I know that you love me; I have trusted you already, until you have become more of a friend than a servant; why should I not tell you more? I love Warren Clifford; I have loved him for years. I do not think he has ever yet suspected it. It was for this reason I had you change those wills. I cared not for the empty gold, but I wanted to have him in my power, to give him all things. To-morrow afternoon he returns, and I shall tell him. Think you I can fail to win a return?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know. You are gifted, and fascinating beyond all others; you have wealth and genius, and oh, such beauty; but does not Mr. Clifford love Miss Atherton?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, that news is best of all. There came a paper to-day, with a notice of her marriage. I shall let him see that first, and then think you his heart can fail to requite my lifelong tenderness? Is that black velvet dress finished?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will wear that to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Juno was indeed glorious in the dress she had chosen. True to her scheming nature, even in the dearest hopes of her heart, she had the black velvet <emph>made for the occasion.</emph> It was cut very low on the neck and bosom, revealing the perfection of her superb shoulders. It fitted closely to her regal figure. The sleeves were very short, and over her snowy arms fell a frill of black lace. She wore not a single ornament; so that her costume was almost severe in its studied simplicity. When all was completed, she<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7298-00000149"/> stood before the mirror. Never in her life had she been so beautiful. The lightness of early girlhood had given place to the rare symmetry of the fully developed woman. The glow on her cheek was as warm as at eighteen, and the eyes so full of fire and passion, were softened by a hope dearer, brighter than her girlhood ever knew. "Pull those pins out of my hair, Jane," she commanded.</p>
               <p>"But they are all which holds it up, madam."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, pull them out." She was obeyed. The glossy, ebon tresses swept downward, almost to her feet. If any thing could have enhanced the perfection of her oriental beauty, it was thus supplied.</p>
               <p>"I shall wear it so," she said, quietly. "Of all times, I would not look overdressed to-day; beside, he has never seen me thus, and I fancy it is becoming."</p>
               <p>Seated on a low divan, in one corner of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">boudoir,</foreign> she had not long to wait, ere the door was thrown open, and she was folded to his heart. Putting her from him after a moment, he looked at her much as one might examine a beautiful painting. "Mother, what is it?" he said, earnestly, "what have you been doing? I never before saw you look so beautiful." Her cheek deepened in its tint, but she answered carelessly—"Nonsense, love, the change is in your own fancy, but sit down here, and tell me all you have done since I saw you."</p>
               <p>The recital was not a long one; and when it was over, she said, "I have news for you, Warren. God grant it be not painful," and she placed in his hand the paper which had come the day before, and pointed to the marked paragraph. He sat so the light from the lofty window fell full upon his face. She watched him narrowly, but the calm reticence of his countenance gave her no reply. "Ah, Warren," she murmured, after a moment—"you see now that she never loved you as I have loved. Think you I could have forgotten in two years?"</p>
               <p>"Her character, indeed, differs from the estimate I had formed, but I gave her up, and I could not have expected her to consecrate her whole life to a memory. She has married one good and noble; may he cherish her lovingly!"</p>
               <p>"But had you chosen differently, had you given me up, think you, in two short years I could have learned the lesson to forget?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure you could not, my own mother, but your love is different."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is different. Listen, Warren; nay, sit where you are; come no nearer; I have a long story to tell you. I knew a girl once, very young, and the world said very beautiful. She had never known the softening influence of a mother's love. Perhaps if she had, her whole life would have been different. But she was her father's idol. Educated at the far South, this young girl of whom I speak, had been<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7298-00000150"/> taught to deem nothing so disgraceful as self-dependence. When she was but sixteen, her indulgent, idolizing father died and left her poor, bitterly poor. No human being could have been more utterly helpless. And then a stranger came. He was a man full twenty years older than herself, but very rich, and her rare beauty won his love. Utterly friendless and destitute, awakened to gratitude by his kindness, touched by his generosity, is it strange that at seventeen she became his bride, though even then her heart cried out in rebellion? Years passed on, and no children were given her; there was no tie to cement the uncongenial union. Clasped in the embrace of a passion to which her heart gave back no answer, what wonder that she came almost to loathe him. At last she met a child, one who interested her greatly; who won from her more of love than she had ever before bestowed on mortal. She made him her own. Her childless heart lavished its wealth upon him; scarcely twelve years younger than herself, she yet cherished him as her son. Then by her husband's will these two were separated. She was surrounded by the enticements of a foreign court. The gay and noble bowed before her, and she had no love for him who called her wife. But she came forth from the trial pure, unstained, even in thought. The memory of that child of her adoption lay warm at her heart; the lips of her lie called mother must not be polluted. She came back to him. For four years they had been separated, and he was grown almost to manhood. He was more beautiful than her brightest dreams. He clasped her in his arms, he folded her to his bosom, and she, oh judge her not harshly, she <emph>loved</emph> him; not with the calm love of a mother, but with womanhood's passionate, deathless idolatry. She had never loved before, and the sweet spell stole upon her unawares. It was long ere she acknowledged it to herself; not until she had heard him breathe another's name in tones of tenderness. Then, alas for it, she felt the sin and the sorrow. She struggled against it, she wrestled with it in the long nights when others slept, and still it grew upon her daily, overcoming all things. It was not a temptation she could flee from. She must dwell in his presence, listen to the melody of his tones, be folded in his arms, and to no one could she turn for counsel or sympathy. Time passed on, and he was separated from the object of his love; but she,—alas, she was still a wife, and she bore on in silence, chiding herself for every throb of the passionate love she could not conquer, as for a deadly sin. Then came death, and she was free. But it was no time for dreams of love, and she kept silence still—she thought his heart might cling to that past love. Warren, shall I say all? Yesterday the news came that Grace Atherton was wedded to another—that she had thus cast from her a love for whose very memory I would have<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7298-00000151"/> perilled my salvation. Life of my life, at least pity me. I cannot bear your scorn. Oh, think before you cast from you a love that ]would sacrifice earth and heaven for your happiness. I have loved you all these years. It is no mock young lady sentimentalism, this passion that has outlasted all things. I am yours, yours. Cast me off never so much, and I will not be another's. My wealth is yours—my life is yours. If you will not call me wife, I will be your slave; but you shall not cast me from you. Is it worth nothing, this wild love? Does it wake no response in your cold heart? Speak to me, Warren! you will drive me mad by this stern silence! Speak to me, if you would not have me die here at your feet! "She started forward, and would have thrown herself on her knees before him, but he restrained her by a look. While she told her love, he had bowed his head lower and lower, so that toward the last she could not see his face, but now he raised it. Sorrowfully, upbraidingly, those blue eyes sought her own. "Speak," she cried once more—"speak, if it be but to curse me. I tell you, you will drive me mad with your silence."</p>
               <p>From his parted lips there fell, calmly, distinctly, the one word—"<emph>Mother.</emph>"It was his only answer, but it said all. In that hour she knew that the wild passion of a lifetime was hopeless. That word, that tone told her, that as a <emph>mother</emph> she had been loved, cherished, respected, and now by this one rash throw, she had lost all. There was a moral heroism, a simple grandeur in that reply, before which her passionate soul did homage. As it fell from his lips, he arose, and passed slowly, determinately, from the room. At the door he paused, and gave one long look backward. She had thrown, herself upon the floor, in a paroxysm of despair, and was tearing out her magnificent hair by handfuls. The clock struck two. That day, that hour, just twelve months before, had John Clifford died. The thought hardened his heart still more against her, and he passed on, out into the street.</p>

               <head>XXI. WARREN HEREFORD STUDIES LAW.</head>
               <p>ALL that night Warren paced back and forth in his room at the Tremont House. By morning he had matured his plans. In a few months more he should complete his twenty-fourth year, and without a fortune, or even a profession, he must commence the world anew. For his adopted mother, he could scarcely analyze his own feelings. He did not, and he never could, return her passionate devotion. When he remembered that she had yielded to it, even as the wife of another, he was tempted to despise her. And yet there were many blessed memories to link him to her. Proud man as he was, his eyes overflowed with tears, as he remembered her generous kindness to his family, her tenderness to his own suffering boyhood, and the impulse which had led him to call her angel, when first he looked upon her beauty. Then came such softening thoughts of the all-enduring love which had followed him ever since —the sacrifices of her pleasure, which she had made for his sake so cheerfully—the sympathy in his sor-rows—the hours she had watched over him in sickness, until he was tempted to go back and lift her head to his bosom. Then there swept over him the memory of her fearful sin, and he seemed to feel her breath upon his cheek. No, he must not see her; he could never give back love for love, and to seek her side on any otter terms, would be worse than useless. A thousand times that night he pictured her to his mind, in her despairing beauty, lonely, sorrowing, calling vainly on his name. He trembled lest she should indeed go mad, as she had said; lest even then she might be a raving maniac, Struggling in the grasp of her black servants. Then he thought of Grace. Not lightly had those early vows been spoken. He would have deemed himself a perjured man, could he have uttered love words to another, and now she was wedded. Those sweet lips were surrendered to another's pressure; that fair form was yielded to another's clasp, and he was alone—alone with not even a grave to which his heart could turn. Had she been dead, he thought in his agony, he could have borne it more easily. Better the winding-sheet should fold her from his arms, than the kisses of other lips come like a wall of fire between them. And then he felt that this was sin. Malcom Hastings was worthy, even of <emph>her</emph> love, and<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7298-00000153"/> he forced himself to kneel down and pray for Heaven's blessing on their heads. He remembered that he too had a work to do, a life-path to tread, however much the way was hedged about with thorns. Looking forth at the future, from among the desert places of his sorrow, he saw his path marked out before him. With the earliest dawning he sat down and wrote to his friend, Percy Douglass. He reminded him of the explanation he had promised, when they met the errand-boy in Broadway, and then recounted, briefly, all his early history. He spoke of all the Past, of his separation from Grace, of his father's death, and then of his mother's passionate love. On this last he dwelt briefly, sorrowfully, and then he wrote;—</p>
               <p>"I have told you all this, Percy, because I felt that it was due to your long-tried friendship, and beside, without this you could not under stand my wishes for the future. I dare not return to my mother. In her past love for me, she has sinned deeply against Heaven, but to me she has been all that mother could be: I will follow her with my blessing. But I must not see her more. It would be worse for her. Beside, I dare not trust myself too far; I could never call her wife, but who can tell how much of temptation might await me in a love like hers, so wild, so impetuous, and uttered by lips so beautiful.</p>
               <p>"I have thought of it all night, I have prayed God to help me, and I have decided. Never again shall I enter that sumptuous dwelling. I will take nothing thence, not even my own wardrobe. Rejecting the love which she offers me, I will take nothing at her hands; I would not even that she should know where I am. To this end I must leave the city. I have only fifty dollars in the world, but it will suffice for my present necessities. You know my early wish to become a lawyer. You will remember that even by the faculty, in our dear old institution, it was pronounced my proper vocation. Your father is an honored and distinguished member of the bar. Will he receive me as his pupil; and not this only, but will he permit me to assist him? I can work. I will do his copying, run his errands, sweep his office, any thing to be independent while I am acquiring my profession. I am not proud, and I know I can be useful. Residing with you at Albany, I shall be far away from the scenes of my early life, and, perchance, I shall be at peace. Write to me soon. Address me at New York, where I am going. I dare not remain here longer, lest, in spite of my convictions of the right, my love and my anxiety should hurry me into my mother's presence. Address me as Warren <emph>Hereford.</emph> It is the only name to which I have legally any right. Commencing a new life, I will do it in my own proper person. Never again call me Clifford. I relinquish the name, the fortune, all that could remind me of the Past. Not yet will I suffer myself to seek<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7298-00000154"/> my own mother's side, though my heart aches, even now, for the pure love of kindred. While I was rich and prosperous, I stood aloof from the loved ones of my infancy; and I will not turn to them in my utter poverty. For a time I will do penance. Not until fickle fortune has once more smiled upon my efforts, will I become a claimant for their tenderness.</p>
               <p>"There is one sorrow of which I have not spoken, and yet, Heaven pity me! it is bitterer than all. You know how I loved Grace Atherton. Not until we were separated, did I realize how much she had been my idol, the hope and the light of my life. After my father's death, she was ever in my thoughts I could not help it. Even in my dreams, I looked into her blue eyes, and listened to the music of her voice. I had meant, when the year of mourning was over, once more to seek her side. I never once thought that she might have ceased to love me. I never doubted that she had been true to me. I cannot trust myself to write of this. Yesterday I came home intending to tell my mother of my hope, and secure her consent. She put into my hand a paper containing the intelligence that Grace—my own Grace—was wedded to another. A great trouble always makes me calm, and my mother construed the cold stillness with which I received the communication into an evidence of indifference. There, I have told you all—I must not dwell on what I suffered When we meet do not speak of this, only understand one thing—I can sacrifice fearlessly all things else, now that my dearest is gone. I will be brave, morally, physically, and I know I shall succeed, even though the fame I win be but a monument above my tomb. I shall never love again. No other brow shall lie upon the breast where her young innocent head has rested.</p>
               <p>"In twenty minutes I shall start for New York; there I shall await your answer. I leave behind me for ever the wealth and luxury in which I have passed the last ten years of my life. I go forward to a Future I am to carve out for myself, and I go fearlessly."</p>
               <p>On the day when he expected an answer to this letter, Warren Hereford walked hurriedly to the post-office. The official received his name, and turned over the great pile of letters in the "H" department "None here, I think,"he said, carelessly, and Warren turned away with his last hope of friendship and assistance well-nigh crushed out. "Here it is, after all," exclaimed the clerk, recalling him; "I beg your pardon, sir."</p>
               <p>Warren eagerly broke the seal. There were a few words in Percy's hand.</p>
               <p>"Come to us now," they said—"come by to-night's boat. I can talk better than I can write. I<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7298-00000155"/> must see you soon, or I shall explode with all the plans I have to lay before you; come."</p>
               <p>This outer sheet enclosed a letter from Gen. Douglass, warm and cordial, though couched in all the ceremonious politeness of the old school. He had several times met Warren, and had conceived for him a hearty friendship. He expressed much pleasure in the prospect of persuading him to make their house his home, and in alluding to his desire for independence, he said—</p>
               <p>"My young friend, I admire and sympathize with the spirit which prompted your remarks most fully. In inviting you to make my house your home, to become my pupil, and consider my purse your own, I am confident that I am making a good bargain for myself. I foresee that you will be one of our first lawyers, and even now you can be of sufficient assistance to me, to more than compensate for all the aid I shall be able to render you. Let us have the happiness of welcoming you as speedily as possible."</p>
               <p>The next morning found Warren Hereford quietly ensconced in the General's breakfast parlor. He bad been most cordially welcomed. Mrs. Douglass, a sweet, motherly woman of about fifty, growing old most gracefully, had made him fully at home in five minutes, by the cheerful, unobtrusive kindness with which she catered for his comfort; and Percy, pulling his arm with a touch of the old, college boyishness, had whispered, "Well, old fellow, I've had your traps carried up into my room. We roomed together for so many years, that I thought I'd take you under my wing again. You know you've gone wrong ever since you have been left to your own devices."</p>
               <p>Well indeed was it for the wanderer that he could moor his boat in such a pleasant haven, and better still that his place with General Douglass was no sinecure. There is no medicine for a troubled heart so infallible as constant and active employment. Percy was heart and soul an artist. It had been his father's cherished hope to see him a lawyer and a statesman, but when he found the fly leaves and broad margins of his best copy of Blackstone covered with sweet angel faces of saints and madonnas, and discovered that his hopeful son was not quite clear as to the difference between the supreme court and that of common pleas, he concluded he might as well make a virtue of necessity, and bestow upon Warren the benefit of his extensive practice and profound legal knowledge, leaving Percy to the more congenial companionship of the vague, delicious visions, which float through the debatable country of a painter's brain.</p>
               <p>He took a vast amount of pride in his pupil's progress, and with good reason. Law was emphatically the young man's native element. He had one of those clear, analytic minds, that delight in nothing so much as a profound argument, and his eloquence was<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7298-00000156"/> forcible, swaying, irresistible. During the two years that elapsed before he was admitted to the bar, he was, under favor of his kind friends, forming acquaintances which were to be of incalculable service in advancing his future success—men of legal and political eminence, as well as of stern moral integrity; and among them all he was recognized as "a rising young man."</p>
               <p>When, at length, after a brilliant examination, his name was enrolled among the authorized members of his profession, the kind General requested a private interview.</p>
               <p>"I am satisfied," he said, cordially grasping his hand, "more than satisfied with your past progress. You have surpassed even the high expectations I had formed of your success. But there is still much ground to be possessed. Your assistance has much more than compensated for all I have done for you. Indeed, I am several hundred dollars in your debt. Now what I want is that you should submit yourself to my direction in the use of this money. For my own sake, I should say to you, stay here and become my partner. "percy will be going to Italy in a year or two more to study the old masters, and my old age will be lonely. None could cheer it so well as you, but still I shall not keep you. I have discussed this matter with several leading men, and they agree with me that New York is the proper field for your talents. I want you should go there now. You must be present at all the public trials of the spring assizes, and I would also have you go often to the Tombs. You will hear there the examinations of the prisoners, and nothing could be more useful. You will become more learned in the manner of cross-questioning witnesses and receiving testimony, and it will be a source of amusement, if not of profit, to watch the proceedings of those rascally Tombs lawyers. After that, I will fit you up a pleasant office, and present you a library, and we shall see what we shall see. I am much mistaken if I do not live to behold you a member of your country's Congress."</p>
               <p>"You are too good," Warren strove to say? but his voice was choked by grateful tears, which were no discredit to his manly nature. He could only clasp closer the kind hand he held, and look the thanks he could not utter, blessing God the while, from his inmost soul, for the friend that had been raised up to him in his hour of bitter need.</p>
               <p>Those two past years had been a period of incessant employment. He had allowed himself no time to look sorrowfully backward into the past. He had lived in the present, and he did well and wisely. Truly had Sara Hargrave prophesied concerning him, that only a great shock could arouse him to his noblest self. That shock had come, and stunned for a moment by the blow, he had yet arisen and struggled manfully.<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7298-00000157"/> All this time he had not written one word to Juno. He thought it impossible that she could have heard of his new residence. For many months he had been deeply anxious concerning her, but reading on the first midsummer after their separation, a lively account in a Boston paper, of a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fête champêtre,</foreign> given at Clifford Hall, which was supposed by the fashionable world to be the prelude to the reappearance of the fair owner among the gay circles of Up-Town, his anxiety was relieved. He lingered with a half-regretful tenderness over the paragraph which enlarged on the splendor of the entertainment, the oriental magnificence of the house and grounds, and above all, the rare beauty of the hostess. That sumptuous home had sheltered the happiest years of his life; that brilliant woman had been very dear to him, and she had loved him wildly as woman loves but once in a lifetime. Oh, there is something very sad in thinking of a lost love. The words we prized so little when they were uttered, sound sadly sweet, floating back to us, softened by the desert years between; the eyes into which we may never more look seem very bright. Warren laid the paper down, with a deep sigh, and drew his hand across his eyes.. He thought the sigh was but breathed out of most tender sympathy for the poor, fated woman's heart, that having none to love, had turned for comfort to such empty breath of fashionable adulation tion; but, all unknown, a tender sorrow for his own sake gave it a deeper tone.</p>
               <p>He had written once to Mohawk Village, in the intensity of his longing for a mother's love, but the letter came back with the words—"gone away," traced on its cover, and so Warren went to New York, a successful student, but a lonely man.</p>

               <head>XXII. THE LONG GAME.</head>
               <p>IT was a clear, cold evening in the first week in December, some two months before Warren Hereford was admitted to the bar. Simon Goldthwaite sat alone in his private counting-room, when Harry Cunningham pushed open the door, and walked hesitatingly to his side. "Mr. Goldthwaite," he said, in a tone as if the request was one he scarcely cared to make, "could you just as well pay me the rest of my year's salary to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Why, you had fifty dollars a week since; there is only one hundred and fifty more to come, and it isn't all due till the first of January."</p>
               <p>"I know it," the young man answered, carelessly.</p>
               <p>"I suppose I may as well leave the last fifty in your hands till New Year's, but I want a hundred to-night pretty badly. This housekeeping is expensive business."</p>
               <p>"So it is;" Simon smiled the cheerful, benevolent smile that had become habitual to him of late. "I suppose we must let you have the money," and he placed the amount in his hands. The young man seized it eagerly, and was turning away. "Wait a moment," said the indefatigable accountant—"here is the receipt to sign."</p>
               <p>"So there is, I beg your pardon. I had quite forgotten it." As he left the store, the bells rung for nine. He had persuaded his sister Kate, as he had done many times of late, to sleep at Brooklyn with her friend Emmie Hereford. On these occasions his excuse had been, that he would be engaged until very late, and it was too lonely for her to remain alone. A passing wonder as to the nature of these engagements sometimes crossed Dick's mind, but their result was so very pleasant, that he forbore to ask any questions. Not a word of love had Dick ever uttered to the beautiful Kate Cunningham, and yet she knew as fully that she was the one joy and hope of his life, as he exulted in the consciousness that he was beloved in return. No words had been needed. His duty to his family forbade him to think of marriage for the present, and the day when he could ask her to share his future might be very far distant. And yet they were both satisfied. For more than three years he had seen her almost daily. She went in and out of his mother's house like a daughter, and he well knew that his faintest tone could call a blush to that eloquent cheek,<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7298-00000159"/> his lightest look cause the fringed eyelids to droop over those hazel eyes.</p>
               <p>Harry Cunningham did not turn his footsteps in the direction of his own home. Standing for a moment in front of the store, he buttoned his overcoat, and drew on his gloves, and then walked hurriedly up the street. "I cannot fail this time," he muttered to himself. "I'll stake so little, I'll be so prudent. If I do win back what I have lost, I'll never set foot inside those accursed doors again. Poor Kate, she mustn't suffer for my fault. She little dreams why she has been sent from home. That would be worst of all to her pure nature." He paused at length before the door of what appeared to be an elegant private mansion, and rung the bell. He spoke in a low tone to the man who answered his summons, and was instantly admitted. There was nothing save the exquisitely carved faro table in the centre of the apartment which he sought, to distinguish it from the drawing-room of any fashionable mansion. Imperial carpets, sumptuous divans of crimson brocade, massive mirrors, pictures, chandeliers, girandoles, every thing was there to minister to the refined habits of the most luxurious. Six weeks ago, he had been introduced for the first time into this scene of enchantment, by a fashionable friend. He had been dazzled by the unaccustomed splendor which surrounded him. Contrary to the remonstrances of his friend, a really kind-hearted hearted fellow, who having plenty of money, could afford to play with a good grace his usual part of loser, Harry had persisted in learning the game. He had the fullest confidence that <emph>he</emph> could scheme more wisely, nor was this confidence one whit abated, though he had already lost two hundred dollars of the hard, earned money which was to have secured the next year's comforts of his orphan sister. He would win that back, he said hopefully to himself, and then play no more. "Hallo, Cunningham," "How are you, my fine fellow?" "Good evening, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami</foreign>" came in varied tones from the men surrounding the table. They were some half-dozen in number, and all what the world calls <emph>gentlemen;</emph> rich men, who considered the loss of a few hundreds a mere pastime. It was yet early in the evening. Several members of the club had not as yet reached their place of rendezvous, and there had been no very heavy playing. The banker stood over the table shuffling the cards. He was tall and slender, really fashionable-looking, with a face that would have been handsome, but for the sinister expression which disfigured it. "Well, gentlemen," he said, lifting his cold gray eyes, "who bets?"</p>
               <p>"I," exclaimed one whom his companions addressed as "Slingsby," and whom they seemed to consider their "crack "player. "I go five dollars on the queen of hearts." He laid the amount on the table, and silently Harry Cunningham laid an equal amount<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7298-00000160"/> beside it. "What, you bet against me, do you?" cried Slingsby, with an assured air.</p>
               <p>"No, I am going to back you."</p>
               <p>"And I, it seems, gentlemen, am to have the honor of betting against both of you, for want of a better opponent," said the banker, in his most deferential tones. He placed ten dollars upon the table. "Lost, gentlemen," he said, with a sweet smile, raking the money towards him, as the winning card proved, to be the ace of spades.</p>
               <p>"Bah," exclaimed Slingsby, in nowise daunted, "no wonder I lost. Dame Fortune was ashamed of me, for staking such a paltry sum. I'll go twenty, this time, on the same lady."</p>
               <p>"And I will back you once more." Mr, Grold-thwaite had paid Harry twenty five dollar bills. He drew the roll from his pocket, and separated four from the rest with nervous eagerness. Again they lost. "Fifty on the same card," exclaimed Slingsby, with imperturbable coolness; then, turning to a companion, he said, in a low tone, "look now, I will bet on that card till it wins, or I lose every dollar in my possession."</p>
               <p>As if in some sort fascinated by this resolute daring, young Cunningham took five more bills from his pile, and placed them on the board. "I'll try twenty-five this time," he said, with a hollow laugh. The banker placed seventy-five beside it, covering both stakes, and the king of hearts fell upon the table. Slingsby took it up with a light laugh. "They twain, of course his wife can't be far behind him. I'll try a hundred this time, and see if she'll think that worth coming for." Cunningham staked his remaining fifty, his last dollar, and once again they lost. Harry grew pale as death. He leaned silently over the back of a chair, with his glittering eyes fixed on the cards. Even Slingsby became somewhat excited. "I've said it, and I'll do it," he muttered in a low tone, "here are two hundred on the queen of hearts."</p>
               <p>"Again? "queried the banker, politely; "it seems rather a losing card this evening." He covered it with a half mocking smile,—<emph>and Slingsby won.</emph> "If I had had only two hundred dollars I might have won all back," thought Harry Cunningham, bitterly, as he turned to the door. "Going," cried several voices.</p>
               <p>"Yes, unless some one has some money he wants to lend."</p>
               <p>"Hardly, to one so much in luck as yourself," was the reply, and he passed out into the night. Dark, repining thoughts were in his mind as he walked along. He cursed himself, he cursed fortune, he almost cursed God. He reached his home at length. He knew Kate had left it not many hours before. There was still a cheerful fire in the grate. An easy chair was drawn before it, and there were his slippers which she had worked. On the table stood some simple refreshment that she had prepared, and on the little stand<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7298-00000161"/> beside her work-table lay a Bible. It had been their mother's once, and for her sake his father had preserved it with almost superstitious care. At his death it had been given to Kate. A folded paper lay between the leaves; she had evidently been reading it. Not for worlds would he have opened those pages. He knew that every line would fall on his heart like an accusation, but by some indescribable magnetism the cover fascinated his eyes, and he sat there, and looked at it, "She is an angel," fell from his lips at length. "That girl is too good for earth; oh God, why am I not more worthy to take care of her? Only fifty dollars left, and "I agreed to pay rent in advance—what will become of us?" Then he rose and paced the small room backward and forward, now and then groaning aloud in his agony. Once he sank on his knees, but he sprang up again, and cried with a bitter sneer, "Yes, <emph>you</emph> had better pray, Harry Cunningham; as well might the Arch-Fiend preach sermons. As if God would hear <emph>you!</emph>" After a time, his features kindled as if with a new thought. He drew his chair to the table, and sat down, bowing his face upon his folded arms. For a full hour he remained motionless. The spirits of good and evil were battling in his soul. The good spirit said, "Go to Kate, confess all; promise never to enter again that place of gilded infamy. She will pity and forgive you; you need fear no reproach from her loving heart. Then borrow money of Mr. Goldthwaite; he is good and generous; and when he knows the circumstances, he will lend it freely. Live frugally, till you are once more free from debt." Over and over again, the good spirit pleaded thus, and every time the bad spirit answered, "But only consider the shame, the humiliation of making such a confession; fancy yourself obliged to submit to the reproof of every man more fortunate than yourself. Think how Kate will grieve; think how long before you can recover the lost confidence of those you value most. If you could only try it once more, with money enough, you could not fail to win."</p>
               <p>That was the strongest thought after all, that with one more trial he should be sure to succeed. He could not lose always; no one did. Had he not failed this time, merely for want of a little more gold? another hundred would have surely saved him. If he could only borrow it, but no one would lend him the large amount he needed. Then the bad spirit suggested, faintly, "You have had papers from the firm to copy, you know their signature. Many another in your place would sign their name to a note, and get it discounted." Again and again the thought recurred to him. He persuaded himself at first that he was quite a hero not to yield to the temptation. Then he thought discontentedly that they ought to be willing; that it would be his salvation, and it could never do them any hurt, for he was sure to restore it; there<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7298-00000162"/> could be no doubt of that; sure as the sun. Finally he ended by taking a sheet of paper, and commencing to imitate their signature. After a few attempts, the counterfeit was so successful that the firm themselves could scarcely have detected the difference. After a while he took from his desk some unfilled notes which chanced to be in his possession. His hand was very like Dick Hereford's since those lessons in penmanship he had taken. That would be another thing in his favor, he thought, suppose he were going to forge a note. Dick prepared such things nearly always for the firm's signature, and if he were to go to a broker with whom they were accustomed to deal, the familiar handwriting would aid to deceive them. Of course he would do nothing of the kind, and yet, if he did, he could take it up long before it fell due. He filled up one of the notes. "If I were going to have any thing," he said to himself, "I would like a thousand dollars. Then before trying what I could do even, I'd pay the rent here for Katie, pay up all our little debts, and get her a good stock of provision, and then I'd have seven hundred left. With that, why with that I could make my fortune." He had been writing as he spoke, and now he read—"Ninety days after date we promise to pay to the order of John A. Wilson, one thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"Humph, I'll sign it; no harm in seeing how it will look," and now signed and dated, it lay before him, as authentic and honest a looking note as one could desire to see. He folded it carefully, after a critical examination, and put it in his pocket-book, all the while persuading himself that he did not intend to use it. It was nearly morning. He threw himself on the bed, and slept a troubled sleep. At first he dreamed a fearful dream, which was yet too much like reality. He thought he had lost every thing in the mad excitement of play, and he seemed to see his gentle sister, the last legacy of his dead father, suffering, aye dying of cold and hunger. He started up shuddering. Then he closed his eyes, and the scene changed. He seemed standing by the faro table. The lights were bright above, and the song and jest were gay around, and then a being fair as a houri approached and whispered, "Bet on the diamonds." Once, twice, thrice, he wag unsuccessful, and each time he doubled his venture, but the fourth time he won, and recovered all he had lost. He awoke in a perfect fever of excitement. It was morning. He threw on his clothes, and rushed out into the fresh air.</p>
               <p>That day, at half-past eleven, he entered the broker's office of John A. Wilson. "Can you accommodate us this morning?" he said to that gentleman, with a tone and manner as assured as if he were one of the firm; "we are making out some heavy payments, and are a little short. We shall probably want to take it up some time before it falls due." The office was full, just then,<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7298-00000163"/> of customers, and merely glancing at the well-known signature, the broker counted out the money, and Harry left the building. For that day he could do no more, for his resolve was fixed to provide for his sister's necessities before hazarding the venture, which all the time he never once doubted would prove successful.</p>
               <p>The next morning he rose early, called upon his landlord, and paid in advance the rent for the next year, taking a receipt with unwonted carefulness. Then to the grocer's, and once more he took a receipt for his large order. Going home he threw both papers in his sister's lap. "Take care of them, Katie, housewife," he said, playfully, "and there," giving her thirty dollars, "is money for any notions you may want to buy." Had her confidence in him been less perfect, she might have been surprised at his being in possession of so much money; but she had long been accustomed to trust every thing to Ms care, so she thanked him smilingly, thinking what a dear, kind brother he was, and fancying that he must have got at least half his next year's salary in advance.</p>
               <p>After she had supposed him gone, he came back again to tell her not to trouble if he did not get home early; he might have something to do that would keep him, she mustn't sit up for him, and she sprang after him to the door, and throwing her arms around his neck, kissed him with an unaccountable presentiment of evil. When he was gone, she chided herself for it, and strove to cast it off, but it rested all day like an incubus upon her spirits.</p>
               <p>That evening Harry Cunningham left the store at an early hour, and walked with an air of resolute determination toward the clubroom, where he had already lost three hundred dollars. Confident that his former failures had arisen merely from want of funds, and trusting most implicitly to the direction given him in his dream, he was positive of success. He determined to commence very cautiously, and to be guided only by his own judgment. He had seven hundred dollars in his possession now; he was determined to bring away a thousand. He replied very carelessly to the salutations which greeted his entrance, then drawing a chair to the table, he deliberately sat down. "Who wants to play against me," he said, "I have had a dream, and I am sure to win." He spoke with a tone of assurance as calm and decided as if he had said, "it is beginning to rain out of doors." For a moment they all seemed to hesitate, and then a man named Luke drew a chair opposite to him and sat down, with an air careless and yet resolute as his own. This man was known as the highest and boldest player connected with the club; and yet he almost always lost. He was evidently of Jewish descent. It was indicated by his dark olive complexion, and oriental eye, as well as by his raven hair, and the whole cast<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7298-00000164"/> of his features. His wealth was apparently boundless, for he had several times lost thousands in a single night, and yet no one had ever known him in the slightest degree agitated or discomposed. For the first hour their stakes were very light, and fortune seemed alternating between them almost equally. Now each had staked a hundred dollars. "It is a fearful night," said Slingsby, entering; "hark a moment, and you can hear the storm hurtle against the windows." At that instant the bet was decided; Harry Cunningham had lost. "There is no hope," said the still small voice of the good spirit in his heart. "Pause, go to Mr. Goldthwaite; he will befriend you. You have five hundred dollars left yet, of the ill-gotten gold." And then the bad spirit answered,—"What, are you then so cowardly? would you give up now, when the means of recovering all your losses are in your hands? Did you not lose in the dream, once, twice, thrice?" and so he played on. At half an hour before midnight, his last dollar was on the table. It was a stake of two hundred. There was a moment's pause in the game, for the storm beat against the windows, and rattled on the pavement, like the tramp of an armed host. "Mr. Luke, why don't you take up your money? Mr. Cunningham, do you perceive you have lost?" said the banker's calm voice.</p>
               <p>"Lost; yes, I <emph>am</emph> lost!" he cried wildly, rousing himself from the apathy into which he had fallen— "you knew I should be. Why didn't you tell me that before?" His tone was so wild, so hopeless, so despairing, that the hearts of his listeners almost stood still to hear it. His face was pale as death, only there was a spot of burning red in the centre of each cheek, glowing like a live coal. He seized his hat, and rushed to the door. "Good evening, gentlemen," he said, turning round with mocking politeness when he had reached it. For a moment after he left there was silence. It was a genteel house. They were not used to the life and death excitement of men staking their last farthing on a desperate hope. His pale face and despairing words had struck terror to the hearts of the bravest. "Go after him; surely some one ought to go after him," cried one of their number, starting from the terrified attitude in which they had sat, looking at each other's faces.</p>
               <p>"No, it is no use," muttered Slingsby, "go on with the game. He is far enough off by this time. The storm will cool him down pretty effectually."</p>
               <p>And so the wretched wanderer hurried on. But the fever in his veins was not one to be allayed by the wild night blowing in his face. There seemed a thousand voices on the blast, and each one shrieked in his ear, "Forger! <emph>forger!</emph>" He had never once doubted that he should win, and feeling so sure he should recover all he had lost, he had scarcely given a thought to his fearful crime. But now, alas, there was<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7298-00000165"/> no hope. What better could he do, than bury his sorrow and his shame from human ken in the boiling waves. He stood upon the pier, and swollen by the rain they were surging like mad beneath his feet. One leap, and then rest! It was a sweet thought, and he stooped forward. The first stroke of the midnight chimes fell upon his ear. He paused, and counted each one. Then a vision came before him. He stood a boy of five before his mother's death-bed. His father bent weeping over her, his baby sister lay beside her. Her thin hand rested upon his hair. "Mother's little Harry must be good," said her faint, sweet tones, "very good, and then some day he will come to mamma. He must take good care of little sister," and then he remembered how passionately she snatched him to her heart with one last effort of her failing strength, and covering his face with tears and kisses murmured, "Oh God keep thee, darling, darling. You will have no mother's love to guide you, and the world is very wicked. But after death comes the judgment; oh, I must watch over you, I <emph>shall,</emph> I feel it, God will let me," and the clasping arms grew very stiff, holding him there, his mother's eyes closed wearily; she was dead. Young as he was, he had always remembered her words, and now they came to him, as if borne on the wings of the storm, with a strange and fearful distinctness. Was he ready for that judgment of which she had spoken? He thought how bright the smile had been on that cold, dead face, but she died the death of a Christian. Was she watching him now? The storm subsided into a low, tearful, sobbing wail, which sounded to his excited fancy like the tones of her voice. He turned away, putting his fingers in his ears to shut out the accusations which seemed borne on every gale, and ran as if for life.</p>
               <p>It was two o'clock when he silently turned his night-key in the lock and entered his own door. Kate was sitting by the fire, pale, but tearless. She sprang up, and threw her arms around his neck. "Not yet in bed?" he asked, kissing her.</p>
               <p>"No, I could not have slept, the storm was so fearful. But oh, Harry, how wild you look! You are wet to the skin. Come, you must put on some dry clothes, and go to bed instantly, and I'll bring you something hot to take. <emph>Do.</emph>"</p>
               <p>He had no choice but to obey her pleading tones. She hovered around him like an angel of mercy, bringing him hot drinks, covering him with heaps of clothes, and now and then laying her cool, moist fingers on his flushed and throbbing brow. The next morning he was not able to rise from the bed. Kate was almost beside herself with terror, but she had the presence of mind of a true woman. She attended to all his little comforts, and then hurrying to a next door neighbor's who she happened to know was blest with<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7298-00000166"/> plenty of boys, she despatched one messenger to his employers, and sent another for a physician. During a whole week he lay in a dull, heavy fever—scarcely speaking during the time. But his thoughts were very busy. Kate watched over him like a guardian angel. Her loving forethought seemed to anticipate his every wish, and more and more intense became every moment the burning, passionate desire to shield her from disgrace. It would do no good to confess now, he thought, not one whit. He had no money to restore what he had taken, and they would think he only confessed for fear of detection and punishment. They surely would never suspect him, and if he were not discovered, he would be rich enough some time to make restoration, penny for penny. Oh for this, he could deny himself every thing, only Kate must not suffer. His love for her was fast becoming idolatry. Day after day, night after night, he lay contriving how he could best escape from the neighborhood of his crime. And by and by, through the kindness of the very man whom he had wronged, the opportunity came. His frank, open face, and remarkable business tact, had already made him a great favorite with his employers, in the three years he had been with them, and during his illness, one or another of the firm called to inquire for him almost daily.</p>
               <p>One day, after he had been ill a week, the senior member of the firm chanced to be present during the Doctor's daily visit. "You are getting better fast," said that worthy functionary; "I only fear the winter will prove too hard for you. Nothing would set you up quite as quick as to go South."</p>
               <p>"Doctor," exclaimed Mr. S., calling him back as he was leaving the room, "do you think Cunningham will be able to travel, and do business by the first of January?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure he will, and before too, if he gets on as nicely as present appearances seem to indicate That is nearly two weeks, and he ought to be on his feet now in three or four days."</p>
               <p>When the M. D. had departed, Mr. S. thoughtfully drew his chair to Harry's bedside. "We have some business affairs in New Orleans just now, that require close attention. We had thought of sending young Hereford to look after them. He has been with us from a boy, we trust him thoroughly, and the trip could hardly fail to give him pleasure. But you seem to need it most. Will you undertake the commission?"</p>
               <p>"Thank Heaven!" was the fervently uttered reply, "I have not deserved such kindness: I will be ready to start at any moment." His great earnestness of manner struck Mr. S. as singular at the time, but he attributed it to the weakness of his nerves, so severely tried by the heavy, nervous fever.</p>
               <p>"Come here, Katie," said the brother, when they<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7298-00000167"/> were again alone. "You know you are going with me?"</p>
               <p>"Can I?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, surely; you don't think I would leave you. They will provide liberally for my expenses, and we can get along easily enough. You must never go out of my sight any more, little Kate. They say every life has its guardian angel. I am more fortunate than others. I can <emph>see</emph> mine; she is my sister."</p>
               <p>New Year's day brought with it several changes. The head bookkeeper left the firm to go into business for himself, and his vacant place would of course fall to the lot of one of his two assistants, Dick Hereford and Mr. Ezekiel Sharpe. Mr. Sharpe was a character after the Uriah Heep order, and he had made application for the post in the most "<emph>umble</emph>" manner. Dick had been quite contented to leave it to the judgment of his employers, though he had a powerful friend in Mr. Goldthwaite. Ezekiel was the elder, and had been two years longer in the store, and he certainly resented it as a bitter injury when Dick received the situation, being, as he expressed it, "promoted over his head." Fifteen hundred dollars was the salary attached to the post, and Dick's first glad thought, after his hearty expression of gratitude, was of marriage and Kate Cunningham. Somewhat to his dismay, he learned that she was to start for New Orleans with her brother the next morning. She spent that evening with his sister, but Harry came with her, and accompanied her home, and he had no opportunity to give utterance to the love, earnest yet tender, which for three long years had so patiently bided its time.</p>

               <head>XXIII. THE DEATH PENALTY.</head>
               <p>THE business in New Orleans was progressing finely. By every mail young Cunningham forwarded to his employers an account of his success, and they daily congratulated themselves on their good-fortune in securing an agent so faithful and trustworthy. But there was something in his manners which Kate had never seen there before, a kind of deprecating tenderness. He had never been so affectionate. True, he had always loved her, but now he would come and put back her curls, and call her his poor little darling, looking into her face so mournfully that it brought tears to her eyes. There was something, too, she could not understand in the eager, fascinated gaze with which he would scan the news items of each northern paper, and the sigh of relief when he laid them down.</p>
               <p>During the latter part of February, Mr. Goldthwaite was sent West to collect some heavy bills for the firm, and the junior partner undertook to supply his place at home. One morning; early in March, he entered the store, and proceeded to the counting-room. He was accompanied by two gentlemen, one of whom Ezekiel Sharpe recognized as the broker, Wilson, with whom he had often transacted business for the firm, and the other he shrewdly suspected to be a police officer. Mr. Wilson held in his hand the forged note, which had that morning been protested. The junior partner was in a state of great excitement, and he was never very cautious. Dick was absent at the time on some errand for his employers, and so taking the note he placed it before Ezekiel with the sudden inquiry—"Do you know that handwriting?"</p>
               <p>At a glance, Ezekiel understood the whole affair. He did not indeed suspect the real culprit, though he knew Dick well enough to believe him innocent; but the loss of the situation he coveted, was still rankling in his mind, and here seemed an excellent opening for revenge. If Dick was exculpated even, as he had really no doubt that he would be, yet the very accusation would be disgraceful and inflict an incurable wound on his sensitive spirit.</p>
               <p>He looked at the note for a moment, and then he answered,—"Why yes, it looks more like Hereford's hand than any one I know of. It isn't just as he usually writes, yet I should recognize it any where. He drawn up the notes, doesn't he?"</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7298-00000169"/>
               <p>"Yes, but don't you comprehend, this note is forged, and it is done so skilfully, it was surely the work of some one very familiar with our signature; but it couldn't have been Hereford?"</p>
               <p>"I should hope not," answered Ezekiel, in a tone of mock sympathy. "You might just compare it with his handwriting in the books," and stepping to Dick's desk he threw one open. They laid the note beside it, and Ezekiel, with an appearance of great horror, exclaimed—"Only look, there are the very same turns to the looped letters; look at those g's and y's; but no, there is some hope yet, the c's are different,"</p>
               <p>"Of course," said Mr. Wilson, impatiently, "he would try to disguise his handwriting, but you recognized it at the first glance; that is sufficient evidence. I must have the young man arrested."</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed the junior partner, with a convulsive shudder, "I had as lief it would have been my brother! I would far rather pay the money."</p>
               <p>The broker seemed at first inclined to accept the offer, but Ezekiel suggested, in his smoothest tones, that it would do no good now, since the sheriff had been witness to the scene; beside, most likely, Hereford would be able to prove himself innocent; and so Mr. S. withdrew his proposal.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps the next thing will be to find him," remarked the sheriff's officer, who had not before spoken; "he must have known that the note fell due this morning, and very likely you will discover him to have taken French leave."</p>
               <p>"Hush," said Ezekiel, with his finger upon his lips, "there he comes; good morning, Hereford."</p>
               <p>The officer advanced leisurely toward the new comer and arrested him for forgery. "Oh, my God!" he cried, turning pale as death. This emotion was of course interpreted as conclusive evidence of his guilt, though it was but the protest of a sensitive, honorable soul against disgrace.</p>
               <p>They placed the note before him, and the similarity of the hand to his own struck him at the first glance. He did not recognize the chirography of Harry Cunningham in its improved form. Truth to tell, toward the close of the lessons, his fairer pupil had occupied so much more of his attention, that he retained no very distinct recollection of any thing connected with Harry's progress. At a careless glance he would have taken the handwriting of the note for his own, and he saw at once the fearful weight such testimony would bear against him.</p>
               <p>"I am innocent, oh I am innocent!" he said, turning his eyes imploringly on Mr. S.</p>
               <p>"God knows I hope you will be able to prove it," answered his employer, fervently.</p>
               <p>"To the Tombs for the first step toward such a desirable consummation," remarked Mr. Wilson, with<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7298-00000170"/> a covert sneer. A private carriage was called by the order of Mr. S., and the four men entered it. Ezekiel went out to the door, and looked after them as long as he could see the carriage, with a gaze of internal satisfaction. During the ride, Dick spoke but once, and that was to inquire how soon the case could be brought to trial.</p>
               <p>"It could be managed in three weeks," was the reply, "unless you chose to have it put off. You could do that if it would help you."</p>
               <p>"Oh no," he answered, eagerly, "not for worlds; it would do me no good. The quicker the better." Then he said nothing more until he stood before the magistrate in the police court. The handwriting was the only evidence against him, but they had brought his ledger from the store, and the similarity was pronounced sufficiently strong to warrant a committal. He listened silently to the magistrate, but when Mr. S. came forward and inquired the necessary amount of bail, he cried impetuously, "May God reward you, sir, for all this kindness, but I <emph>will not</emph> be bailed out. The Heavenly Father will not suffer me to be condemned innocently, and I can stay here for three weeks. I will not go with the shadow of this grief upon me into my happy home. No, I will wait here."</p>
               <p>It was in vain to attempt to shake his resolution. At length he turned to his employer. "Do you indeed believe me innocent?" he asked, in tremulous tones.</p>
               <p>"I do; from my heart I do," was the earnest reply; "but I fear my belief cannot help you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it can. Oh, if you believe it, I pray you go to my mother and my sisters, and tell them so. Tell them they cannot see me, that if they come here they will be refused admission. Bid them, if they love me, stay quietly at home until every thing is decided. I will not have them link themselves with my unmerited disgrace. Tell my mother, by my hopes of the Heaven in which she has taught me to believe, I am guiltless of this crime. Will you do all this?"</p>
               <p>"I will," answered Mr. S., deeply moved, "and now let me see that you have proper counsel."</p>
               <p>"He has," cried a firm voice, from the other side of the room, "I will plead for him; I, his brother," and starting forward, a handsome, distinguished-looking young man sprang to the prisoner's side, and murmured, in husky tones, "My brother, my own brother Dick."</p>
               <p>Those immediately interested in the examination, had been too much absorbed during its continuance, to notice this stranger, who had sat with flushed face and eager eyes, bending breathlessly forward. Warren Hereford had been for three days only in New York, and that morning had visited the Tombs for the first time. He accompanied his brother to his cell, and<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7298-00000171"/> when once they were alone, clasped him in his arms with an embrace passionate in its fondness. "To meet <emph>thus!</emph>" he murmured, "after these many years."</p>
               <p>Dick raised his head and looked at him with his clear eyes—"I am innocent, brother Warren," he said, almost reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"Innocent! Good Heavens, did you think I doubted that for a moment? If I did I should go mad; but that you should be suspected is horrible!"</p>
               <p>During the half-hour that followed, Warren recounted, briefly, all his past life since their separation, and told how destitute and lonely he had seemed at the time of his separation from his adopted mother. Then he spoke of the generous friend and teacher God had given him; of his resolution not to seek out his own family until he should have proved himself worthy of them by energy and perseverance; of the time when, prompted by his irresistible yearning for love, he had written to his mother, and learned from the return of his letter, that she had gone away; and then he said, with the earnest, boyhood look, whose memory Dick had cherished so faithfully, "You tell me they have been here nearly four years, and are all well and happy? I shall see them by and by."</p>
               <p>"To-night, surely you will go to them to-night?"</p>
               <p>"No, did you not hear me charge Mr. S. not to let them know I was in the city? Do not urge me, it is useless. I will not meet them until I have won a right to their tenderness by rescuing you from disgrace. Alas! I can never be to them what you are. You have always loved them, Dick."</p>
               <p>"And they have always loved you; but are you sure I shall get clear?"</p>
               <p>Warren had still a firm faith in his profession. He devoutly believed that it was all-powerful to detect the guilty, and screen the innocent from punishment, so he answered, cheerfully,"There is no doubt of that, not the least. We must find out whether the broker remembers who presented the note, and see if we can prove that you were somewhere else just then. Keep up a good heart. We shall manage it all nicely."</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson had no distinct recollection of the person who had given him the note, but he remembered the hour and the day distinctly, and Warren was able to prove that his brother had been at the store, engaged in his usual employment, at the time when the business was transacted. This was one thing in his favor, but there seemed no clue to guide them to the detection of the real criminal. Harry Cunningham might not have escaped suspicion so readily, had not all his letters to the firm, from New Orleans, been written by his sister, at his dictation. She readily accepted his excuse that his fever had left him too nervous to write legibly, and they, unaware of this fact, and constantly receiving letters signed with his name, in a hand differing so widely from that of the forged note, never<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7298-00000172"/> even fancied for a moment that their trusty agent might have been its author. Mrs. Hereford and her daughters obeyed Dick's earnest wish that they would not visit him, but they suffered even more severely in their lonely home, than did the prisoner in his cell, cheered as he was by the daily visits of the enthusiastic, hopeful Warren. It was Warren's first case, and this circumstance alone would have excited him intensely, had it not been absorbed in a deeper consideration. His brother, his only brother was a prisoner, charged with a fearful crime, and on his efforts depended his acquittal. Night and day he gave his energies to the task with a zeal that never flagged.</p>
               <p>A week after Dick's examination before the police court, Harry Cunningham and his sister sat alone in their room at. New Orleans. It was evening. He had been very busy all that day, and now he opened the papers for the first time. He unfolded one, and then laid it down, pressing his hand to his brow. "Kate," he murmured, "something terrible is in that paper."</p>
               <p>"What, where?" She sprang to his side.</p>
               <p>"I have not seen it yet, but I <emph>feel</emph> it; I felt it the moment I took the paper in my hand. There, let me look!" His eye glanced quickly over the long column of police reports, and then the paper dropped from his grasp. "Just Heaven," he cried, "my best friend, Dick Hereford!" Even before he spoke, Kate had read the whole paragraph. Her lover, for so in her heart she considered him—he, whom she had deemed the impersonation of all goodness and nobleness, was in prison for forgery. From her pale lips there came no word, no moan, but gliding to the floor, as quietly as a snow-wreath, she lay there, as silent, as helpless, and almost as white. Mastering for the moment his own intense emotion, he sprinkled her face with ice-water, and raised her in his arms. Kissing her he murmured, "He is innocent! he is innocent! Poor Kate! was he then so loved?"</p>
               <p>The words, "He is innocent," seemed to rouse her from her stupor. She opened her eyes, and clung to him shudderingly. "Do you know?" she gasped; "are you sure?"</p>
               <p>"Alas, yes; listen, Kate, it was me, I did it. "He had feared she would go back to that death-like swoon, but she kept her glittering eyes fixed on his face, and only said, very faintly, "You, brother Harry, you?"</p>
               <p>In reply he told her all the history of the crime. How he had been first introduced into the club-room; how, little by little, the temptation had overcome him; how he had welcomed the chance to go South, as an escape from the terror that haunted him day and night; how he had been even more wretched since, in his wild foreboding of evil; but how God knew he had never dreamed it would come to this, never dreamed another<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7298-00000173"/> would suffer in his stead—and now," he said, with a sorrowful pause, as he concluded.</p>
               <p>"Well, what now; what will you do now?" She looked into his face with something almost fierce in her burning eyes.</p>
               <p>"There is but one course, Kate; I must make all my arrangements here to-morrow morning, and we must travel night and day, you and I, poor little Kate,—we can get there before the trial. He must not suffer—the innocent for the guilty. I will confess it all, and then, oh Kate, darling, darling, you will be the sister of a condemned felon."</p>
               <p>Then she kissed him, and the tears gushed from those burning eyes, until their glance grew tenderer. "That is right," she said. "Now work. I will never desert you, but Dick must be saved."</p>
               <p>"He shall. Kate, child, are you going to hate me? God knows I have loved you through it all. "she could not trust herself to answer, but once more she kissed him.</p>
               <p>The Court-House was crowded to overflowing, to witness the trial of the handsome young clerk. The examination of the witnesses was very brief. On the part of the prosecution the handwriting of the forged note was compared with young Hereford's account books, and several persons swore to their belief in its identity. The defence summoned witnesses to prove the unimpeached character of the accused, and his presence in the counting-room of his employer, at the time when the note was presented. The State's attorney, in opening the case, dwelt upon the close similarity of the handwriting, and the opportunity afforded by the prisoner's position, to become familiar with the signature of his employers. When Warren spoke, his whole heart was in his subject, and he was glowingly, and yet truthfully eloquent. He called the attention of the Court to the different formation of various letters, in I the note, and in the books of the accused, which he said must be obvious to them all; he spoke of the calm security of innocence which had led the prisoner to remain cheerful, serene, and undisturbed in the performance of his daily duties, up to the very morning of his arrest; of the certainty that he did not present the note to the broker, and the improbability that, had he been guilty, he would have trusted this task to another's hand. Having proved that the evidence was merely circumstantial in its character, and imperfect in various respects, he dwelt upon the testimony which had been offered, to prove the integrity and well-known virtues of the accused. He told of the widowed mother, and blind sister, whose support and dependence he had so long been; of the humble and happy home which his conviction would make desolate, until there was not a dry eye among his listeners, save only that of the untroubled Ezekiel, When he concluded<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7298-00000174"/> cluded, the lawyer for the prosecution declined to reply. The charge of the judge was brief and impressive. He reminded them that according to the whole spirit of the law, where a reasonable doubt existed, the prisoner was to have the benefit of it; and then, without even retiring, the jury rendered a unanimous verdict of "Not Guilty," and one long, irrepressible shout of applause rang through the Court-House. The prisoner, overcome for the first time, bowed his head upon his hands in a gush of silent tears.</p>
               <p>Two of our old friends were present at the trial; Simon Goldthwaite, who had unexpectedly returned, and General Douglass, who had come down from Albany to listen with proud satisfaction to the maiden plea of his pupil. Scarcely had the universal acclamation subsided, when a messenger entered the court, and placed a folded note in Warren Clifford's hand. It was addressed to the council for the defence. "May it please the Court," he said, after a hasty perusal," I am requested to summon a magistrate, and proceed to Williamsburgh, to receive the confession of one Harry Cunningham, the real perpetrator of this forgery, who is lying at the point of death."</p>
               <p>Dick had recognized, as the note was unfolded, the handwriting of his beloved Kate, and springing to Warren's side he obtained possession of it. There was a request at the bottom of the page, made in the sick man's name, that he too would accompany the magistrate trate, if it might be permitted. He beckoned Mr. Goldthwaite to his side, and entreated him, in a hurried whisper, to go immediately to his mother and sisters, assure them of his acquittal, and bring Mrs. Hereford and Emmie to Williamsburgh.</p>
               <p>Accompanied by a magistrate, as well as the senior partner of the firm, and his own brother Warren, Dick Hereford entered the chamber where Kate Cunningham awaited him, standing by the bedside of the dying. A physician was holding the pulse of the repentant criminal. His eye brightened when it rested on Dick's well-known features, and he extended his hand. "You didn't thinly! meant to wrong <emph>you</emph>" he said, faintly. "I never dreamed that you could be suspected."</p>
               <p>"I know it, Harry," said Dick's cordial, friendly tones, as he pressed the thin hand he held.</p>
               <p>They had left New Orleans the afternoon of the next day after they received news of Dick's arrest. Kate's strength and energy seemed untiring, and Harry was possessed by the one wild longing to make confession and reparation as far as possible, while it was yet in his power. The anxiety attendant on his crime, and its concealment, had rapidly undermined his constitution, and he had scarcely passed two days of his homeward journey, before he woke to the conviction that already his hours were numbered, that he was very near to death. They had been obliged<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7298-00000175"/> to travel by slow stages, toward the last, on account of his extreme weakness, but Kate had hurried him forward, and ever forward. There were hours in the future, when she thought of this merciless haste with bitter tears; but at the time, her mind had room for but one picture—her lover condemned, imprisoned for a crime of which he was not guilty. They had reached their home but the evening before, and her woman's tenderness came back with a burst of repentant sorrow, when she saw her brother sink upon the bed, too exhausted to speak or move. For a time she almost thought he had already ceased to breathe, as he lay prone upon that couch from which he never rose again. All night the physician had remained beside him, in the vain attempt to restore his exhausted energies. It was late in the next forenoon, before she had time to glance at the morning paper. She had not expected the trial could take place in several weeks, but now she read that it was to be that very day. Already she thought he might be condemned. She seized a pen, and wrote a rapid note to the lawyer for the defence, and despatched it to the Court-House. Then going back to his bedside, she said, in a low, firm tone, "You <emph>must</emph> speak now, Harry. Even now Dick Hereford is on trial for <emph>your</emph> crime; I have sent a messenger to the Court-House, and they will come here to receive your confession."</p>
               <p>His eyes kindled, he raised himself on his elbow "Thank God," he said earnestly, "that I can make so much of atonement."</p>
               <p>Now that those she had summoned were gathered about his bedside, he insisted on making a full and clear confession which should be taken down in writing. "It is not worth while to trouble about that," said Mr. S., kindly. "Hereford has been acquitted, and we forgive you the fault very freely."</p>
               <p>But she still persisted, and finding he could be satisfied in no other way, they suffered him to proceed. Scarcely was the task over when Mrs. Hereford entered the room with Emmie, followed by the indefatigable Simon. There was a silent, tearful embrace, in which Warren folded his long-lost mother and mister to his throbbing heart, and then all eyes were fixed on Harry. A fearful change was passing over his face, and Kate Cunningham, raising her eyes for the first time since their entrance, whispered hoarsely, "Is it death?" Her brother caught the whisper. "Yes, it is death," he answered," and it is bitter. I am going to leave you helpless, friendless, with a stained name."</p>
               <p>"Not friendless," said Mrs. Hereford, gently; "not motherless while I live."</p>
               <p>"She shall bear my name if she will," said Dick's earnest tones. "This is no time nor place for lover's vows, but I have loved her well and long."</p>
               <p>Harry's dying eyes sparkled. "Dick Hereford," he cried eagerly, "would you wed a forger's sister?"</p>
               <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7298-00000176"/>
               <p>"I would wed Kate Cunningham," was the reply, "if she could think me worthy, and thank God day and night that she was mine."</p>
               <p>"Kate, dear little Kate," pleaded the dying man, "will you not answer him?"</p>
               <p>She could not speak, but she placed her hand in one that clasped it, in that hour of bitter sorrow, with a pressure whose thrilling touch she remembered every day of her after life.</p>
               <p>For a moment Harry Cunningham closed his eyes, with a smile of thankful peace. Then his face contracted with an expression of intense pain, and he cried out in a wild, despairing tone, "I have prayed to Him for life, and He will not hear me. I am going, going to the blackness and darkness, and the long despair. 'To the uttermost farthing,' it says, I must pay for all—'to the uttermost farthing' Kate Cunningham, answer me, doesn't it say so in the Bible?"</p>
               <p>Kate could not speak for very terror, but Mrs. Hereford said, soothingly, "That is to those who do not repent; but you repent, don't you, and God for Christ's sake is very merciful."</p>
               <p>"I repent—yes, I repent." he said, repeating the words slowly, "but you say hope when there is no hope. Kate, pray. Repeat that prayer I heard you reading last night when you thought I was asleep."</p>
               <p>It was no time for hesitation. She knew it was <emph>her</emph> voice he longed to hear, and regardless of the strangers around his bedside, she knelt down, and bowing her head, repeated in clear, distinct tones, the Church of England's beautiful prayer for the dying. He grew weak very rapidly, meanwhile, but it seemed to soothe him. "It is hard work," he said, faintly, when she concluded, "<emph>hard</emph> work getting ready now, but I can't live the bad life over again. Don't it say Christ pardoned the thief on the Cross? Kate, sister, my eyes are getting dim, so I can't see you very plain, sing to me. Sing that hymn mother wanted to hear when she was dying."</p>
               <p>And struggling with her tears, the fair girl sang. Her clear voice flooded the room with its melody. Ere she concluded, a smile broke like light over his dying features. His lips parted, and bending over him they caught the word "<emph>mother!</emph>" Then the smile faded out into the cold, gray hue of death, the young life lapsed away into the night.</p>
               <p>Was there any hope? God and the future alone can answer the question which those sorrowing mourners whispered to their own hearts with a thrill of fear. God is merciful, and human strength is weakness. We can but trust. Lovingly Kate Cunningham pushed the clustering curls from that damp brow; tenderly she pressed her lips to that still, dead face, and turning away, met, for the first time, the tender kiss of her betrothed, and then came the blessed tears. Harry Cunningham had paid the Death Penalty.</p>

               <head>XXIV. THE BRIDAL.</head>
               <p>AFTER the funeral was over, and Kate Cunningham had looked for the last time on the dead face of her only brother, Mrs. Hereford, urgently seconded by Dick, had insisted on her removal to their own residence. Emmie could not be spared to remain with her any longer, and Dick would not consent to her being left alone, in that deserted home. It was not good for her to be there, they could all see that. She would wander listlessly from room to room, sit in his favorite seat, smooth the pillows on his bed, and take up his books, opening one after another and laying them down again with an air of patient sorrow, which it broke their hearts to see.</p>
               <p>And so they carried her away from it all. The room she shared with Emmie Hereford, in the home to which she was welcomed as a daughter, was bright, and sunny as Emmie's own face. Paper of a light and cheerful pattern was on the walls, flowers were in the windows, and muslin curtains, lined with rose-colored cambric, aided to give it a cheerful look. The family circle, too, among which she came, had just that happy, cheerful cast which was needed to restore the tone of her mind. Now that Warren was once more with them, Mrs. Hereford thought she had nothing left for which to wish. His brilliant and successful plea, and the circumstances attending it, had already established his reputation among the members of his own profession, and surrounded by those who had loved him from infancy, his heart forgot its loneliness, and he was happier than he had been for years. The family sitting-room, "Sunbeam's room," as they called it, where they all assembled of an evening, remained just as Simon had originally arranged it, save that Dick had added, for Kate's accommodation, another little chair and table, the counterpart of Emmie's own. Here Simon came often of an evening, and found good, motherly Mrs. Hereford; sweet, patient Mabel; Kate in her haughty, womanly beauty, looking in her deep mourning robes a little less proud and defiant than of old; Warren, with his thoughtful, earnest look; Dick, subduing his light-heartedness into tenderest care and sympathy for his betrothed; and the one face which to his eyes seemed so much fairer and sweeter than all, her whom he had long ago called "Little Sunbeam."</p>
               <p>It was impossible to bear a heavy heart among such cheerful and innocent happiness, and ere long Kate Cunningham felt the weight being gradually lifted from her soul. She chided herself when she<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7298-00000178"/> first discovered this. It seemed to her like injustice to the memory of the dead, and stretching forth her hand, she pushed back untasted the cup of pleasure, and folded closer to her heart the old, desolate sorrow. But it seemed to be gradually stealing away from her while she slept, for each morning, as the spring days grew longer, the first sun-rays stealing through the muslin window-curtains, and making meshes of light in her tangled curls, awoke her to a fresher and more exultant sense of the young life within.</p>
               <p>But one evening, it was a sobbing April storm. A long day, turbulent with rain, had gone down amid clouds and darkness. It was twilight. One great cloud canopied the sky from pole to pole. There was not a single streak of blue, not one star hung out as a night-lamp to point the way to Heaven. There had been a lull, in which the wind had sobbed and wailed, like the despairing cry of a human soul, and now the storm burst forth again. Like grape-shot it rattled against the windows, faster and ever fiercer, as it would seem to retreat, and then come rushing up again to the encounter. There was no light in the room, save the bright glow from the blazing coal fire, and it revealed the outline of Kate Cunningham's superb figure dimly traced against the window pane. She had flung back her long black curls, and they fell down over her shoulders, mingling with the folds of her mourning dress. Her hands were folded together, and her great, mournful eyes looked out into the storm. Mrs. Hereford was in another room, Mabel sat rocking slowly back and forth, in a low chair before the fire, repeating now and then snatches of hymns about saints and martyrs. At a little distance sat Emmie, mournfully watching her friend, but yet not daring to interrupt her solemn reverie.</p>
               <p>After a time, Kate turned toward her, pushing the curls still farther from her pale brow. "It was just such a night, Emmie," she said in a low, yet intense tone, "when <emph>he</emph> came home after he had committed that forgery. He told me afterward that the winds shrieked 'forger' in his ear all the way. Oh, how wet he was. I made him go to bed, and the next day he was so sick, and he never got quite well again. Didn't he suffer enough in <emph>this</emph> world; answer me that?"</p>
               <p>But Emmie dared not speak to her, in this mood of sorrowful yet fierce excitement, and she exclaimed more earnestly, "Why don't you answer? You all hate him, and despise him; I know you do, and you will not comfort me. Why don't you tell me he is happy?"</p>
               <p>"Kate," it was Mabel's calm, steady voice which spoke, "come away from that window, please, and kneel down here beside my chair in the firelight." It was so seldom Mabel expressed a wish, and she was so<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7298-00000179"/> loved and reverenced in the household, that even Kate Cunningham in her wildest moods was accustomed to render her implicit obedience, so she went and knelt down beside her on the carpet. The blind girl threaded those masses of curls with her fingers, and then she said, in a grieved tone, "Kate, you have hurt me very much. Do you not love our Father in Heaven, and where Love is should not Faith and Trust walk beside her? Do you fear to trust Harry in <emph>His</emph> hands, who died for his enemies? This impatient sorrow is very wrong. You have love to bless you; such passionate, absorbing love as may never be the blind girl's portion. Is not Dick more to you than even Harry ever was, and yet you murmur. Even I, who cannot look upon a loved one's face, who cannot see the stars nor the sunshine, and who can never listen to love words from mortal lips, save the love of kindred, yet sit by the fireside grateful, happy; and you, rich in all those things for which my soul might long in vain for ever, look forth into the storm and murmur!"</p>
               <p>"I was wrong. Forgive me!" The rich voice was penitent and tearful as the tones of an humbled child, and the proud head was bowed in a passion of tears on the gentle Mabel's lap. From that hour no word of mourning or repining fell from Kate Cunningham's lips. She wore a smile of hopeful resignation that night when she greeted her betrothed, and all that long, stormy evening, she sat beside him, with her hand clasped in his, meekly, lovingly, all her prido humbled, and her grief softened; as gentle as a three year child.</p>
               <p>Mabel's favorite position was by Warren's side, her head lying upon his breast. She had been parted from him so many years, that it was a perpetual delight to touch him, to assure herself of his presence, to realize thus that he was come back again, to be once more her own brother. She reminded him, painfully, at first, of his lost Grace, with her blue eyes, and the pale gold of her hair, but gradually the resemblance grew to be a pleasure, half tearful it is true, but yet so exquisite, he would not have relinquished it for worlds.</p>
               <p>"Well, mother, congratulate me, I am a rich man," said Dick, coming home one evening in early June. His mother smiled. "Ah," he cried, gayly, "you needn't look so incredulous, it's quite true, and I brought along that sober-faced Warren to add the weight of his testimony to mine. My employers called me into their private room this morning, and told me they felt that that unfortunate suit last spring must have wounded me deeply, and they had wished to have it in their power to make some amends; they had always found me faithful and capable, and had concluded to offer me a share in their business. It would be many times more advantageous, they said, than my<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7298-00000180"/> present situation, and the only capital I need bring was my talents. Of course I could only thank them, in a gratitude altogether more sincere than eloquent. They told me I might dispose as I pleased of my present post of chief bookkeeper.</p>
               <p>"What did you do with it?" asked Emmie, eagerly,</p>
               <p>"What do you think, Sunbeam? I gave it to Mr. Ezekiel Sharpe. I knew he was a good bookkeeper, and faithful to the firm, notwithstanding his hatred to me, and I fancied he might like me better after getting the situation which was so long the object of his ambition. But where is Kate? Mr. S. spoke so kindly about my prospect of entering into another partnership, and they are desirous I should live in a style suitable to the reputation of the firm, so the poor errand-boy that was can give his bride a sumptuous Up-Town residence after all?"</p>
               <p>"You are my good boy, always," said his mother, kissing him with glistening eyes. "Kate is in the garden, and I wish you God speed in your errand."</p>
               <p>It took many a prayer, many an entreaty to persuade Kate to become a bride, so soon after the death of her only brother. But Dick set before her how long and how patiently he had already waited, how many years he had loved her faithfully and well, and at last he won a blushing, half-reluctant consent to the early day he wished to name.</p>
               <p>Emmie was to be bridesmaid, and Dick begged that Simon might be invited to stand with her, he was such an old friend. Kate consented, on condition that Dick himself should superintend the manufacture of a suit of clothes for that worthy individual, not more than one inch too short at the wrists and ankles, and that she might also have Mabel, to whom her heart clung with peculiar tenderness. And so Warren Hereford writing to invite his friend Percy to attend the nuptials, added, "Mabel my sister is sweet, fair, and graceful. Could you go to the altar with a blind girl on your arm, without too great a sacrifice of pride? Will you attend her as groomsman?"</p>
               <p>And Percy Douglass answered it in person. At the first glance, his artistic eye was charmed with the perfectness of Mabel's features, and the pure, spiritual cast of her young face. He said he could almost fancy one of Titian's saints had stepped out of its frame, to come among mortals. The low, sweet tones of her voice were just suited to her face and figure, and altogether there was a beautiful harmony about her so that she charmed him like some saintly painting, or some of Haydn's sublime yet low and soothing church music.</p>
               <p>The group standing before the altar of Holy Trinity, on that bridal morning, would have been deeply interesting even to a stranger. The young bride, youngest of them all, yet so haughty in the carriage<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7298-00000181"/> of her dainty head, and her queenly step; so beautiful with her irregular, piquant features, her flushed cheeks, her hazel eyes, and crimson-threaded lips, and the raven curls that shone through the misty folds of her vail; so touchingly humble and gentle in the timid glance she lifted now and then to the proud face bending over her; so unstained in her woman's truth and purity,—the groom, handsome, protecting, manly,—Emmie in her simple, muslin robe, with her sunny face, her smoothly braided brown hair, and her loving brown eyes,—Simon, with the new garments, whose extra length seemed an awkward encumbrance of which he hardly knew how to dispose, with his ungainly figure, and his irascible hair,—Mabel, with her swaying form, her lily-like grace and purity,—Percy, dreamy-eyed, ardent, in a word artist-like; and standing near them "Warren, with his mother on his arm, her thoughts going back to the quiet little English church where her own bridal vows were plighted, in her vanished spring-time of youth and loveliness, listening to a voice which had long been singing with the angels; and his, making pictures of past scenes, and dreaming about how bright had risen over his own path the stars of hope and love, which had gone down in night.</p>
               <p>Bridals are always solemn, where the heart goes with the hand; where the young, beautiful life is offered up in meek trust and lovingness at the shrine of the heart's worship. The sun-rays floated through the stained glass windows, making the shadow of a cross on Mabel's young, bowed head, and resting like a crown of glory on the dark curls of the bride. There was a silent prayer, trembling upward from each quivering lip, and then rising they walked down the aisle. Drawing the hand he held through his arm, Dick bent downward to look in the hazel eyes of his Kate, and whispered for the first time, those sweet, fond words, "My wife."</p>
               <p>The bridal home, where they were to spend the first day, was situated very pleasantly, in a fashionable street. It was furnished with unostentatious elegance. The paintings and statuary had been Percy Douglass' bridal gift, and from the firm, into whose number he had so recently been admitted, Dick received a massive and elegant service of plate, marked with the name of his bride. One little room opening into the conservatory, was the gem of the whole house, and Dick had furnished it for his wife's morning room. In the golden-wired cage by the window, a mocking bird was pouring forth his soul in song. Vases of rare and costly flowers filled the air with their fragrance; elegantly bound copies of the young bride's favorite authors stored the shelves of a rosewood book-case, and every little fancy of her capricious nature had been minutely studied in its arrangement<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7298-00000182"/> ment. They went there alone, while the rest of the party were examining the mansion.</p>
               <p>For the first time that day Kate's eyes filled with tears. Going up to his side, she laid her head with child-like simplicity upon his arm, and said, "You are very good to me, my husband," and Dick, holding her to his heart, in his arms, as he had longed to hold her from the first hour he looked upon her beauty, was silent in the fulness of his great joy.</p>
               <p>Driving with the bridal <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cortége</foreign> up Broadway, Warren Hereford saw a familiar face. A carriage closely shut drove by him, and looking through its window Juno Clifford's reproachful eyes fell upon him, sitting at his own true mother's side. There was a look about that face which his heart ached to see; a desolate, weary, forsaken look, as if earth had nothing left worth living for, and yet her eyes were veiled that she could not gaze toward Heaven. The two carriages passed each other very slowly. He could see the quadroon crouched in the corner, with the old look on her dusky face; he could note the impatient movement with which Juno pushed back the hair from her brow, and the strained, eager glance with which her eyes followed him. It recalled all her old love for him, the tenderness which had so blessed his boyish life, and the passionate idolatry which at length had driven him from her side. He longed to go to her, to offer to be her son once more; to pour out in one gush of eloquent words, all his past love for her, all his grateful remembrance of her kindness; but other duties were upon him now, and he passed and made no sign.</p>
               <p>She had heard of him in New York, and had purchased a sumptuous mansion there, with the sole hope of once more looking upon that face so madly and so vainly loved. And now she had seen him. She gave orders to be driven home. She went into her own room, and sat down alone with the spectres of the past. So many years she had wished John Clifford dead, for this, for this. He had gone back now, this brave, young lover, to the friends from whom she <emph>bought</emph> him in his poverty-stricken boyhood. He had rewarded her love with his cold scorn, and yet she loved him still; that one look from his earnest eyes had thrilled her heart as no other one's glance had done in all her lifetime.</p>
               <p>She smiled bitterly at her own folly. In a frantic self-contempt, she tore the jewels from her hair; the folds of lace and muslin from her heart. She abandoned herself to a paroxysm of despair. She gnashed her beautiful teeth, tears rained from her proud eyes, and then, looking backward, she cursed him bitterly under her breath.</p>
               <p>That evening she went forth from her lonely room, jewels flashing in her tresses, gleaming on her arms, and burning on her bosom. Her eyes sparkled with<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7298-00000183"/> mirth, her lips were wreathed with smiles, and proud Up-Town condescended to wonder at her toilette so unequalled in its richness, and her stately beauty.</p>
               <p>Many times after that Warren met her carriage in his daily walks. The haughty, despairing face would be pressed against the pane, the servant crouching in the corner would look at him with her eyes of fire, and so they two, who had shared one home so long, who had so loved, and so parted, lived on in the same city, and never spoke.</p>

               <head>XXV. L'INCONNUE.</head>
               <p>DO you see that humble-looking little cottage? It is the home of one to whose genius the world has already begun to do homage. The simply furnished room is bathed in the sober glory of the September moonlight. A lady of, it may be, twenty-five, is sitting by the vine-wreathed window. She is very simply clad, in her deep-mourning costume, the dress made high at the neck, and the sleeve falling in heavy folds to the slight wrist. Her face, though gentle, is very sad, her large blue eyes wear a look of patient grief, lightened by trust in heaven, and her golden curls alone relieve the grave plainness of her attire. At her feet kneels a child so sweet and fair you might have deemed her an infant cherub strayed away from Heaven. And yet at one time her mother must have resembled her very much. The child has the same curling, sunny hair, the same large blue eyes, but smiles curve in and out at the rosebud mouth, and the eyes are full of childish<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7298-00000184"/> merriment, albeit half hidden now by the veiling lashes. The tiny hands, white as ocean spray-wreaths, are meekly folded, and the baby voice is lisping a simple evening prayer.</p>
               <p>When it was over, the mother raised her in her arms and laid her gently in her low bed. "Kiss Rosie," said the sweet voice—"Rosie dood all day." The kiss was given, and then the mother sat down beside her, and gently sung her to sleep. When at length the little busy hands were quite at rest, and the blue eyes were tightly closed, she rose from her seat, and, bending over her, pressed her lips to that polished brow. All the mother's love was in her eyes, as she raised her head, and there was a deep and touching tenderness in the voice which whispered, "For thy sake, little one, surely God will give me His blessing."</p>
               <p>Then she lit a tiny lamp, and drew forth from her desk a closely written manuscript. Seizing a pen she wrote rapidly. After a time there came to the sad face a look of inspiration-tears trembled on the lashes, the colorless cheeks grew flushed and red as hearts of June-time roses. Then that too passed, and once more she lived in the present; a lonely, sorrowful woman, with a grave beneath her feet.</p>
               <p>At this moment there was a gentle tap on the outer door. She opened it noiselessly. "Oh, it is you, Sara? This is indeed kind. Come in softly so as not to wake Rose, for I want to talk to you."</p>
               <p>The visitor entered, laid aside her bonnet, and threw her shawl upon a chair. As Mrs. Joseph Seaton, the rector's wife, she was little changed from that Sara Hargrave whom we knew long ago.</p>
               <p>"Well, Grace," she said, "talk fast. What have you determined?" Now, indeed, hearing her called by the old name, with her face kindled by that smile of welcome, you could recognize some traces of the light-hearted Grace Atherton of other days. Her voice, when she replied, had some of the old tones blended with its dreamy sadness.</p>
               <p>"I am getting on pretty well," she said. "I came here because you were here, and you were my last friend. I couldn't stay in Glenthorne with all those graves. It has proved the best thing after all. Ever since you introduced me to Dr. Baldwin, I get along nicely. I write a sketch for the Standard, every week, and he pays my five dollars so punctually that I do very well indeed."</p>
               <p>"And you call <emph>that</emph> very well? Five dollars a week for you and this child?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, for the present, but I know' Rose will need more soon. I have a plan in my head, and you must advise me about it. You know one of my great trials was parting with Irish Mary. She has been with me ever since that visit to Boston. She would have staid with me freely, but I could not even give her bread to eat. She followed me to Alexandria,<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7298-00000185"/> though I had not found it out when I saw you last. She is chambermaid and nurse in a family here. Poor thing, she didn't know how to find me, and it was by the merest accident I met her as I was taking Rose out for a walk. Now my ambition is to be able to get her back again. I need her very much. No child could be better than Rose, but it takes more than half my time to amuse her. With no one to take care of her, I cannot send her away from me for a moment, and I can't resist the temptation to pet her and make her happy, when I see her little face get so lonely with watching me at my task. The truth is I do not write much except when she is sleeping."</p>
               <p>"That is it. I have often wondered you did not try to write for something beside the Standard. You are famous already, Gracie. You would hardly believe it if I were to tell you how many inquiries I hear about <foreign xml:lang="FRA">L' Inconnue,</foreign> how much of praise is lavished at her shrine."</p>
               <p>"Then may-be you won't think my plan so very wild." Grace drew nearer to her, and rested her head caressingly against her shoulder. "I am trying," she said in a timid, half-frightened whisper, "trying to write a book."</p>
               <p>"You are, you pet wild-bird, you little darling. It's the very thing I wanted you to do, but I thought you couldn't have time. Have you begun it? What do you call it?"</p>
               <p>"I have christened it "Cousin Elsie," and only look, I have all this written." She laid the manuscript on Lady Sara's lap.</p>
               <p>For a half-hour her visitor sat silently reading it; then laying it down, she said, earnestly—"Grace, you will succeed, you cannot fail. You are writing a book that will live."</p>
               <p>There was rapture in those delicious tears, dimming the blue eyes lifted to her face. "You have done me so much good," she said, in her pretty, graceful way. "Now I can sit up nights, and work at it so much more hopefully. But look out, there is Joseph at the gate, and you must go. Sara, pray for me. I am lonely, and sometimes I am weak,"</p>
               <p>"I do, I will, and Our Father will strengthen you to do this work. Good-by, Grace, my friend, my sister."</p>
               <p>Then she went away in the moonlight, leaning on her husband's arm, and Grace came back into the humble cottage. There was no broad breast where her head might rest, no strong heart to shelter her; and yet she lifted her thankful eyes to heaven for the girl-hood friend, whose love was with her still; for the sleeping child, whose lips had learned to call her mother; and for the gift of that genius which could evoke from Chaos a magic world of her own, and people it with the creations of her fancy. Then, trimming the little lamp once more, she eat down and wrote late into the night.</p>

               <head>XXVI. SIMON GOLDTHWAITE SEES THE SUN RISE.</head>
               <p>ONCE more it was summer. A year had passed since Dick Hereford led a bride to the altar. Dick's affairs had prospered, and his wife had just been driven up to her mother-in-law's door, by her own coachman, in her own carriage, and taken Mrs. Hereford and Mabel for an airing, while Emmie was left to keep house. Simon Groldthwaite ascended the steps somewhat slowly, and rang the bell, as if his errand was of a less agreeable nature than usual. It was very singular, but a quick blush mantled Emmie's cheek when she heard his shuffling footstep in the hall; and the little fingers crocheting so busily, dropped a stitch in the pretty purse. He came in and took a seat near her. "How do you do, Little Sunbeam," had been his customary salutation, but now he simply said "Good afternoon," and then remained for a few moments in silence.</p>
               <p>After a time he remarked, in a composed voice, "You remember Stephen Montfort, Emmie?"</p>
               <p>She laughed. "What, that nice young gentleman who used to take so much pains to help me find Dick, when I first came to the city?"</p>
               <p>"The same. He is a noble young man, the very best clerk we have in the store, and he loves you and wants to marry you."</p>
               <p>"Me!" She laughed still more merrily. "Why, I scarcely ever said a half-dozen words to him in my life."</p>
               <p>"But he says he has loved you from the first; I don't think it so strange, Emmie. He could see the pure soul looking out of your face. Ah, you are a fortunate girl, for he is young, and handsome, and honorable; well worthy of woman's love. I am sure will be happy."</p>
               <p>"Have I <emph>got</emph> to marry him?" She had stopped laughing now, and she looked up like a frightened child.</p>
               <p>"Got to! Oh no; but you can hardly fail to want to. It is right to marry; at least people who have tried it, say it's the happiest way, and you could never hope to do better. He loves you very truly."</p>
               <p>A queer, quizzical look lurked about the corners of Emmie's mouth. "Does he? Well, why didn't he tell me of it himself; what did he send you for?"</p>
               <p>There was an accent of wounded feeling in Simon's tone, as he replied, "I don't wonder you ask Words of love do not come very fittingly from my mouth. I<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7298-00000187"/> am indeed a strange messenger for such an errand But he did not like to speak to Dick, and I came here so often, I knew you so well, I suppose he thought I would do his bidding faithfully."</p>
               <p>"Well, you can go back and tell him I do not want him."</p>
               <p>"But surely you do not mean that. I should be sorry that his having been unfortunate enough to choose such an awkward ambassador should lose him the suit on which his whole life's happiness depends."</p>
               <p>"Should you? Then <emph>you</emph> want me to marry him?" Emmie's tone was more nearly petulant than he had ever before heard it. A new yet faint light began to break into his mind, like the clouds of gold which herald the dawning. It was his turn to question.</p>
               <p>"Emmie, ought you to refuse this offer? Would it be right to make him wretched, with no better reason than a girlish caprice?"</p>
               <p>She drooped her lashes over the tears that had begun to glitter in her eyes. Her voice was very low and tremulous, as she said—"It is no woman's whim. I cannot marry him, for I love another."</p>
               <p>"What other? Nay, listen, Emmie, do not turn away. I must know. Forgive me, I have no right to say must, but if I have ever been kind to you or yours, if I have ever deserved your confidence, you will tell me now."</p>
               <p>He drew her toward him, but he held her very awkwardly, much as you have seen an old bachelor take up a three month's baby. "Now Emmie, tell me," he whispered, with his lips so near her cheek that they almost touched the brown braids of her hair.</p>
               <p>Her nature was very truthful, and she felt it was a question which he had a right to ask, and she must answer even though he should despise her so when he said again, still more earnestly, "Tell me whom you love, Emmie," she whispered, "You"</p>
               <p>It was but a single word, still Simon heard it distinctly. There was no awkwardness now, the young loving girl he held was his own. He drew her fervently to his heart, murmuring—"Say it again, Emmie, oh say it again. This is such happiness. I have loved you always. But you <emph>don't</emph> love me, Emmie,—you can't love me. You are mocking me. I am old and ugly; I <emph>could</emph> not win your love. Look up. Let me see your eyes."</p>
               <p>He lifted her head from his shoulder, and looked earnestly in her face. There was no mistaking the clear, innocent, brown eyes that so fearlessly met his own. Looking into their depths, he knew that of a very truth he was beloved; that the young heart throbbing against his side would beat for him only, for ever. The sunny face he had loved to gaze on, would brighten his own fireside, and as all that wealth of love and light flooded his soul, he saw the sun of<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7298-00000188"/> his life arise, a sun which could only set above her grave or his, and clasping her still more tenderly he murmured, "Mine, mine at last; Little Sunbeam mine!"</p>
               <p>It was strange, so the world would have said, that that graceful girl, so young, so fair, should have turned from the fashionable-looking young wooer who sought her love, to lay her hand in that great, awkward palm which was so tenderly smoothing her tresses. But it seemed not strange to Emmie. To her, the lineaments of Simon Goldthwaite's face wore a glorious beauty, for she looked through them to the hero-soul within. Very deeply she reverenced him, and her only wonder was that her simple, devoted affection should have power so to move one so noble as she deemed him. They were so fully satisfied with, so suited to each other, that their tenderness was beautiful to see.</p>
               <p>"Now you can go," whispered Emmie, playfully, raising her head from the broad breast where it was lying, "you can go and tell Mr. Montfort that I will marry him, because you don't think I can do any better."</p>
               <p>"No I won't, Sunbeam. I'll go and ask him to go to church next week and see <emph>us</emph> married."</p>
               <p>"Next week?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, why not? There is plenty of time. You will like it best to have no parade, so shall I. Pomp and show would hardly suit the husband you have chosen, and I want my little girl made all my own as soon as possible. I am a great many years older than you, darling, and mine has been a lonely, sorrowful life. Since my mother died and left me a friendless little thing not much beyond babyhood, no one ever loved me until I knew Dick; and now, now that the love for which I never dared to hope has come,—for I feel it in my soul that you do love me, Emmie,—now that I am your life as fully as you have long been mine, I will not have you separated from me a day longer than is necessary. Oh, I need you. Do you remember your oak tree and ivy vine at Mohawk Village? Well, you are my ivy, and you must twine around me in your youth and innocence until you hide my deformity with your tenderness and your beauty."</p>
               <p>The gentle kiss she dropped upon his brow, the proud look in her earnest eyes, told that, to her at least, there was no deformity to conceal. Beading her face, he said, "You are silent, Emmie. You do not fear to become mine, to trust your future in my keeping?"</p>
               <p>"Fear! It is not that. How could I fear when I love you so? But I was thinking of Mabel and my mother. Is it right to leave them?"</p>
               <p>"You do not think I would ask it, Emmie? There is room enough here for us all, and a quiet home is all we care for, my darling. I know your tastes so well. If you wanted splendor, you should have it, for I am rich enough to give it to you, but I think I know<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7298-00000189"/> what trill please you better. I like this home. Then there is that house lot on the south side, standing empty. It is so pleasant to see the green grass growing there. Warren, you know, takes his seat in Congress next December, and there will be no one to see to things while he is in Washington. I tell you what, Emmie, he has a three years' lease of this house. He shall give it up to me, and then I'll buy the house, and well all live here together. I never could like any other home half so well, because it was here I saw you first. Do you like my plan, little darling?"</p>
               <p>Her eyes answered him, with their look of blessed content, even better than the sweet voice which fairly trembled with delight. Then she laughed gayly. "I was thinking," she said, "about that first evening you ever came here, and how funny you looked when you sat down on your hat. Do you remember it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and how I loved you from that first blessed moment, though you seemed so far apart from me in your youth and beauty, and I never dared hope to call you wife. Oh, Emmie!"</p>
               <p>Time passed unheeded by those two so deeply blest, and it was nearly sunset when Emmie sprang from the arms which so tenderly enfolded her. "Look," she exclaimed, "there is the carriage at the door. Mamma and Mabel are on the steps, and see, there is Kate laughing her good-by. The sun is setting."</p>
               <p>He folded his arm around her waist, and whispered, "I have seen the sun rise for the first time, this afternoon, my darling,—the sun of hope, and truth, and love, which never dawned for me before. It will bless all my future."</p>
               <p>He stood there beside her, with his arm around her, when Mrs. Hereford opened the door. With a simple dignity, he clasped her hand in his, and went to meet her mother. "She loves me, "he said, earnestly; "she has promised to be my wife. Will you give us your blessing?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hereford read the Amen to his prayer in Emmie's pleading eyes, and thankfully she gave the consent for which they both hoped. That night the wedding day was fixed. "I must write to Percy," said Warren, with Mabel's head lying in its usual resting-place upon his breast, and none but he noted the sudden flushing of the pale cheek, or the quick drooping of the golden lashes over the sightless eyes. When he saw these tokens of the emotion which that name awakened, it gave him a sudden thrill of terror. Percy had been a frequent visitor during the past year. Could it be he had come too often for his blind sister's peace; she who must love, if at all, so hopelessly?</p>
               <p>The day before the wedding Simon Goldthwaite threw two folded papers into Emmie's lap. "It is my bridal present, darling," he said, as she opened them. One was the deed of the pleasant house which<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7298-00000190"/> had so long been her home; the other, of the empty house-lot on the south.</p>
               <p>For a moment her heart was. too full to speak, then she said, smiling through her tears and holding up the paper she had last unfolded, "But what in the world am I to do with this; you don't expect me to turn land speculator?" "No, but fight here, among the city's din, I wanted to make a little country for you. I remembered how you used to enjoy your flowers and your chickens, and so we will have a high wall put round this spot, with grape-vines and ivy-vines twining over it, and you shall have plenty of posies, and a little summer-house in the centre, and a place for your poultry yard." He paused, for she was sobbing in his arms. "What now, Emmie, dearest, have I vexed you?"</p>
               <p>"Vexed me 1 Oh, my best one, you will kill me with such kindness. I am so intensely happy, it makes the tears come. You don't leave me any thing to wish for. Can it last?"</p>
               <p>"Please God, it shall last through your life and mine, my blessed one."</p>
               <p>The bridal was very quiet. They were married in church. Emmie looked so neat, and trim, and wife-like, in the little white chip travelling hat, and the fawn-colored travelling dress. And once more Percy Douglass led Mabel to the altar, and she stood there as bridesmaid, who might never hope to stand there as bride; once more kneeling before the altar, the sunshine came through the stained-glass windows, making the shadow of a cross on that young, bowed head.</p>
               <p>It was wonderful to see what an effect love and happiness had produced on Simon. His very figure seemed to have changed. His hair was still in the nominative case independent, and his features were as irregular as the architecture of a modern building, but there was scarcely a trace of the awkward and angular Simon in that manly form, bending so protectingly over the young girl at his side.</p>
               <p>They rode away alone together, the newly married pair. They were to travel for a while, and so commence building up that peaceful world of their own into which no third person could ever come. Emmie longed to ride upon the broad lakes of the West, to listen to the eternal anthem of Niagara, to look upon the great calm face of the "Old man of the mountains," and for this once, all Emmie's simple wishes were to meet their fulfilment.</p>
               <p>That night Mabel was alone. She had taken Emmie's old seat by the window, and she sat there thinking sorrowfully of the sister who was in some degree lost to her, since she could never again be so exclusively her own. The door opened gently, a step she knew too well, if one could judge by the quick suffusion<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7298-00000191"/> sion of her delicate face, stole quietly across the caret. She could not see him, and yet she knew that percy Douglass was kneeling by her side, even before his arm had stolen about her waist.</p>
               <p>"Nay, turn not away, my sweet Mabel," said his leading voice. "I have come to tell you that without your love life has henceforth for me no joy and no hoe. Oh, Mabel, I have longed to say this for many months, but I have not dared. You have seemed so pure, so saint-like, as if thought or touch of earthly passion must not come nigh you. But the words must be spoken. I love you, Mabel; I would die for you, Mabel; but this is weak. I cannot make you understand my soul with empty words. Oh, let me live for you,—let me prove my love in every act of my life, Oh Mabel, love me. Can I not win you by years of waiting? I will be so good, so pure, if you Will give me ever so little hope,"</p>
               <p>He paused, and the sweet face was not turned away. "I have loved you long," she whispered, and her hand lay still in his fervent clasp.</p>
               <p>"And you will be my wife, my life's angel; you <emph>will,</emph> Mabel?"</p>
               <p>She shuddered. "Oh, I don't know," she said, "I <emph>dare</emph> not. If I could but <emph>see</emph> you. You must not link your bright, sunshiny existence with the night and darkness of the blind."</p>
               <p>"Oh Mabel, do not torture me I What is all this when I love you—when I am wild to call you mine?"</p>
               <p>"It is much, dearest, though you may not feel it now. But I will not say no, I will not answer you. I will tell you in the morning."</p>
               <p>To all his passionate pleadings she would give but this one answer—"I will tell you in the morning;" still, she suffered him to draw her to his heart, to lay her head on his bosom, and talk to her for one long, blessed hour, of the beautiful future he would plan for her; of the long days when he would never weary of making word-pictures for her sake, about every thing in art and nature.</p>
               <p>Then she crept from his arms, and went up stairs in the moonlight. After a time her mother came to the door of her little room, but it was locked, and the sweet voice within pleaded—"Please let me stay alone this one night, dear mother," and so she was left to herself. For three hours she knelt before her bed, motionless as a statue, trying to see the right, and praying God to give her strength. One thought was ever in her mind—"What if she should marry him, and by and by he should weary of the blind wife he had chosen? He would go forth in the world and meet fair and lovely women, their eloquent glances would flash sunshine into his soul, and then he might turn regretfully to the sealed eyes that could only gaze toward Heaven. Loving him as she did, would<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7298-00000192"/> it not be wrong and selfish to subject him to the bare possibility of such a fate?" When once her heart and her conscience had answered this question in the affirmative,—when once she had become convinced that it would be <emph>wrong,</emph> her mind was made up. There was a firmness of principle, a strength of character about that delicate, young blind girl, that no one would have suspected, who looked upon her almost ethereal loveliness.</p>
               <p>She arose, and sat down by the window, in the moonlight. The love which, from her earliest girlhood, she had learned to look upon as a blessed gift in which she could have no part nor lot, had come like a stray bird, praying to nestle in her bosom, and sing songs to her all her life long. And now she must turn the glorious wanderer out of doors, out into the midnight, and perchance into the storm. Oh, if she could but see! for a moment there was a rebellious thought, a murmur against Heaven, but she subdued it instantly. Until the morning she sat there, absorbed in her pictures of what might have been. There was a strange, wild happiness in knowing that she was beloved, even if she must put the sparkling cup untasted from her lips.</p>
               <p>At early dawning she went down stairs. Her lover met her at the door of the sitting-room. "I could not sleep," he said, "and so I am here, waiting for you."</p>
               <p>She gave him her hand, and suffered him to lead her to a seat, and encircle her with his arm, but he almost trembled as he saw the unshed tears glittering upon her lashes, and the pale face, which the conflict of one night had made so ghastly. "I cannot, I will not be your wife," she said, in passionate, hurried tones, as if longing to have the scene over.</p>
               <p>"Not my wife? Do I hear you? Do I understand you? Then Heaven pity me. Did you not say you loved me?"</p>
               <p>"I do love you, but I will not marry you. I cannot, I dare not. Do not plead with me, for I have decided, and all you can say will only pain me." He looked into her face, and saw the fixed, stony wretchedness on those young, wistful features, and he had no choice but to believe her. "Is there no hope?" he murmured, clasping her passionately to his bosom, and she answered, "There is none!"</p>
               <p>"Good-by, my life's star, my Mabel. I must not stay here, or I shall go mad." He put her from him, and walked to the door; but once, twice, thrice he came back to press a hundred passionate kisses on that pure, sorrowful face, and then he went out, with his aching, desolated heart, into the beautiful morning sunshine; and she sat there where he had left her, not fainting, but fixed, and motionless, in the profound stupor of this heavy sorrow.</p>

               <head>XXVII. OUR ROSEBUD</head>
               <p>IT was a December day, cold, even at Washington. Warren Hereford drew a fur-lined cloak about his shoulders, as he stepped on board a crowded ferry-boat to cross over to Alexandria. There was a lady on the other side of the boat whose appearance singularly interested him; He could only see the outline of her classic profile beneath the long folds of her black crape veil, and a single curl, which, unconsciously to the wearer, had strayed out from the close hat, and floated like a ray of sunshine over her mourning garments. Every time he looked, there seemed something more and more familiar in her aspect, something that made his pulses thrill, and his heart beat faster. On the seat beside her, stood a graceful little creature, a sweet child, as beautiful as an infant angel He watched them both, furtively, yet eagerly, until a friend standing near called his attention to some object at a little distance.</p>
               <p>Before he again turned toward them, a piercing scream froze upon the air. A voice gave it utterance which he recognized but too surely; a voice which had haunted the dreams of years. "Save her!" it shrieked, "save her, my child, my Rosebud!"</p>
               <p>He sprang forward just as the mother was struggling to throw herself into the sea, in a frantic attempt to rescue her lost darling. He threw his cloak to a by-stander. "Hold her, in Heaven's name hold her," he shouted, "and stop the boat!" In an instant more he was in the wake of the boat, near the spot where the little one had fallen, waiting for her to rise the second time. There was a moment's breathless hush—the child rose to the surface of the water—he sprang forward—he caught her. In two minutes more she was in her mother's arms.</p>
               <p>Then the tears came, falling on the little one's hair, rousing her from her trance, and when the blue eyes opened at length, the young mother lifted her tearful face. "May God bless you," she murmured; "I cannot thank you."</p>
               <p>His reply came as naturally, as authoritatively almost, as if they had not been parted for a day, and she was still the young girl, happy most of all in yielding to his wishes. "Grace," he said, holding out the cloak lined with fur, "give her to me, she is too heavy for you now, and beside she is wet. I will wrap her in this."</p>
               <p>Abandoning herself for a moment to the old dream,<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7298-00000194"/> she obeyed his tone of command, and gave him the child. He said nothing more for a while, then bending over to look into her eyes, he noticed for the first time how fearfully thin and pale she had grown. "Grace!" he murmured.</p>
               <p>The hoped-for reply came—"Warren!" and he seemed satisfied.</p>
               <p>When they reached the landing, he called a carriage, and she looked up inquiringly. "I am going with you, Grace," he said; "you could not think I would leave you."</p>
               <p>She blushed slightly, but made no objection, merely remarking that it was but a step, as she gave directions to the driver.</p>
               <p>"Grace," he asked once more, as still holding the dripping child he sprang to a seat beside her, "do you live here?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am all alone now,—Rose and I, I mean."</p>
               <p>He chided himself for a wild joy-thrill which he could not help at the thought that she was once more free; but he controlled his voice perfectly, and calmly inquired if he could be of any farther assistance after she reached home. No, she was very grateful, but she should need nothing. At least, then, she would let him come back again in the evening. He would go and get some dry clothes, and be with her very early. She did not refuse. When he gave the little Rose back again to her arms, he bent over and pressed a fond kiss on the child's sweet brow, and then drawing his cloak around him sprang back into the carriage.</p>
               <p>His heart beat tumultuously as he opened her gate that evening, and walked up to the door. She met him with a smile of welcome, and he entered. Little Rose sprang to greet him, and he raised her in his arms. "It did not hurt her, Grace?" he said, inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"No, I think not in the least, but I fear you cannot say the same. I have been feeling badly ever since, lest I treated you almost unkindly, in my anxiety for her. Oh, I was not thankless, do not think so; I owe you more than life. To live would have been terrible, without her, my darling."</p>
               <p>Then she spoke of his success, She had heard he was in Congress, and she congratulated him warmly. For a time they conversed on indifferent subjects, until the little Rose had fairly gone to sleep in his arms. The mother raised her from his lap, and laid her on the bed, and when she came back, he drew his chair nearer, and said, "Grace, may I tell you what has been in my heart for nearly four years past?"</p>
               <p>"Surely the preserver of my child has earned a right to speak to me freely."</p>
               <p>"I would you had not said that, Grace; but I have no right to murmur. What I suffered when we parted, you can never dream. The next year was one long,<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7298-00000195"/> despairing void. It boots not now to speak of that. Then my father died, and Grace, may-be it was wicked, but I could not help a feeling something like relief, I had never dreamed that you would not be true to me, and I thought when the year of mourning was over I could come to your side, and call you mine. Your image was with me night and day, and with this hope strong in my heart, I went home to my mother, on the anniversary of my father's death. She showed me that day a paper containing your marriage, Grace, my idolized Grace was another's. I thought I should go mad. I dared not blame you, for I myself had given you up; and yet God knows if you had been false to me ten thousand times, I could never have loved another. Perhaps it was well for me that my mother mistook my despair for indifference, and told me what I had never before suspected, that she loved me, not with a mother's unselfish tenderness, but with a woman's passionate love. I could not return it, I could not stay with her, and that very hour we parted. I have never entered her doors since. I studied law without her aid, and now, as you have heard, I am in Congress. For nearly two years I have been with my own mother and the sisters of whom we used to talk; but oh, Grace, there has been such an aching void at my heart all these years. I am not like you, I could not love another."</p>
               <p>"Warren," she cried, with flashing eyes, "that is ungenerous, unmanly. Had you not to-day given me back my child rescued by your hands from death, I would tell you that you did not deserve to hear the story of my life since our parting. But listen, you shall know all. When that cruel letter came—forgive the word, but it seemed cruel then—when I knew that you had chosen between love and wealth, between me and Mrs. Clifford, I fell to the floor more dead than alive. For six long weeks I lay in the delirium of a brain, fever that had well-nigh proved fatal. Week after week those anxious parents watching over me had no hope that I would arise unless it were to madness. But youth and their fond care at length prevailed, and I went forth into the sunshine, a girl no longer; a heart-broken, miserable woman. Malcom Hastings knew all, and longed to comfort me. I learned then that he had worshipped me with all his noble, generous heart, ever since we first came to Glenthorne. He did not ask me then to marry him, but his care for my comfort was constant. The flowers in my vases, the books on my table, the fresh fruit with which he strove to tempt my capricious appetite, all were his gift. At that time my heart seemed dead. It never thrilled with one such emotion as you had inspired, and yet he became very dear. I should have been worse than an ingrate to have borne a thankless heart for his constant kindness.</p>
               <p>"At last my parents sickened. I have no strength<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7298-00000196"/> to speak of that. They died on the same day, and were buried in one grave. It was God's own reward to the life-long faithfulness of their love. The day they died I was kneeling by their bedside. Malcom Hastings was there too. He had shared my watching through it all. My father had been a long time silent. At last he put forth his thin hand, and drew my curls caressingly through his fingers. 'My poor Grace,' he said, 'this is hardest. I shall have to leave you poor, and so friendless.</p>
               <p>Not friendless while I live, 5 said Malcom, drawing nearer. 'I know,' my father answered, 'you have loved her long and faithfully, but the world would judge her harshly if you were her protector and not her husband. I would have given her to your care so gladly. If she were your wife, I could die happy! 5 I rose and turned my pale face toward Malcom Hastings. 'Malcom,' I said, 'I loved Warren Clifford as I can never love another. He gave me up at the command of his father, and I have never seen him since. That father has been dead a year, and he has not sought my side. He is lost, dead to me, and now you are dearer than all others, save these my parents. It is not such love as I bore him that I can give you, but it is calm and pure; it will be faithful. Is it worth your having?'</p>
               <p>"He came to my side. 'It is worth all things,' he said, fervently. 'Will you be my wife now? It would make <emph>them</emph> happier?' I saw the anxious look in my fathers eyes, and I bowed my head. In half an hour a clergyman stood at the bedside. It was Joseph Seaton, who was then in Glenthorne. We were married, and I bent to kiss my fathers brow. He clasped me convulsively to his heart, murmuring, 'Thank God!' and in that embrace he died. My mother movea then, it was the first time that day, and laid her head upon his breast. She never lifted it again.</p>
               <p>"After the burial, my husband took me home. It was a fair, sweet home which he gave me, and I loved it, but my heart was very sad. I could not forget the past. Its bitter waters would surge chokingly over my soul until I longed to lie down in the churchyard beside that double grave. Malcom was gentle with me always. Oh, how he loved me! My sad face and mourning robes brought only darkness to his hearthstone, and yet I was dearer than his own life. When they put my baby in my arms, I thanked God. I thought the touch of those tiny fingers would bring the warmth back to my life. For a time I was happier; and then, just as I was learning to requite his tenderness, my husband died.' There was another grave in the churchyard, and another empty place in my heart.</p>
               <p>"And then came poverty. He had been very rich, and he thought he had left enough for me and baby.<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7298-00000197"/> But a friend for whom he had endorsed to the amount of his whole fortune, one whom he loved and trusted as a brother, failed and swept away our whole dependence in the wreck of his own property. Then I came here. I knew I had one friend still, in the wife of Joseph Seaton, and I was too much a bankrupt in human love not to seek her? and this was her homo. By means of her influence I got employment, and I managed to support myself very comfortably."</p>
               <p>Warren dared not question her as to the nature of her task, but a roll of music lay upon the stand, and he fancied she was a teacher. "Forgive me, Grace," he said, when she had concluded her recital, "forgive me that I ever dared to deem you false or fickle. We have both suffered, shall we not both forgive? Grace, may we not dream the old dream o'er again? Will you be my wife now?"</p>
               <p>She rose from her chair and drew her slight figure up to its fullest height. "Mr. Hereford," she said, in a tone very firm and almost haughty, "if you would have my friendship, if you would visit here at all, never mention this again. You chose once. You gave up the poor Grace Atherton for wealthier friends, and now Grace Hastings, poorer still, will not accept from your compassion, what she failed to gain from your love."</p>
               <p>"But oh, Grace, my life's angel, you cannot be so unforgiving, so merciless. It broke my heart to give you up, but I thought it duty. Grace, Grace, my own sweet love, life of my life, do not send me forth from your presence, hopeless, miserable."</p>
               <p>She heard him through, she could not help it, for his words thrilled her heart with a joy whose exquisiteness was almost pain, but her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes glittering.</p>
               <p>"No," she said, "I will not bid you hope; I will not be your wife. You wronged me bitterly. But for you, my parents might be living still. They looked upon my sorrow till their hearts were broken, and they died. Go! When you can speak of other themes, my child's preserver will be welcome."</p>
               <p>He had no choice but to obey, and when once more she was alone, she bowed her head and wept wildly. She loved him still. Every tone of his voice had power to make her heart tremble with the olden thrill. She would have given worlds but to be folded to his breast once more, but pride had triumphed. While she was obscure and portionless she would not become <emph>his</emph> bride. At length she raised her head, and said hopefully to herself—" Courage, faint heart. All is not lost yet. Even his love may be mine. In three months I shall know whether 'Cousin Elsie' succeeds, and if it does, oh then the successful authoress may be even Ms bride. He has been faithful, and it may be the reward is at hand."</p>

               <head>XXVIII. THE BLIND EYES SEE.</head>
               <p>THE three months passed rapidly. Warren could not stay away, but he visited Grace Hastings rather as a cherished sister, than one whom he had hoped to call his wife. The little Rose learned to know his footstep, and she would spring to meet him, and cling caressingly to his neck, with her chubby arms. Once or twice he had met Mrs. Seaton, and she had reminded him of her old prophecy about his greatness, with a generous pride in its fulfilment. It was early in April, when he entered the house one evening with a copy of "Cousin Elsie" in his hand.</p>
               <p>"It is glorious, it is magnetic," were his first words. Then he said, eagerly, "I have brought you something, Grace, which I want you to read for my sake. What a strange signature—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">L'Inconnue!</foreign> There is so much of desolation in that word—The Unknown! It is as if she said the friendless, the forsaken. Oh, Grace, I wish I knew her; she must have suffered as few women have suffered, and borne as few could have borne. There is power here, life and vitality, and yet sometimes there gushes forth a perfect <emph>wail</emph> of music. There is always, too, a deep, underlying principle of faith and trust in Heaven. But listen, I must read it to you myself, at least some of it. I want you to feel it as I do."</p>
               <p>And Grace listened, with flushed cheek and kindled eye. The hour of her reward had come. The seed sown in silence and sorrow, and watered with tears, had sprung up, and borne fruit a hundred-fold. "The Unknown" heard her own praises from the lips dearest on earth. Passages, which she had written in doubt and fear, by the bedside of her sleeping child, came to her now as a revelation, and fairly thrilled her with their beauty, now that his voice gave them utterance. It was as if she had entertained angel guests without looking upon their faces, and when the veil was put aside, stood bewildered at their loveliness. But not that evening would she disclose her secret. She would wait a little to get accustomed to her position.</p>
               <p>When he left, she took the book from his hand, and lifting her eyes to his face, remarked, "I want to see you to-morrow, Warren; will you come over and spend the evening?"</p>
               <p>He bent over her with the old love-light in his<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7298-00000199"/> glance, and there was deep tenderness in the voice with which he gave the promise she requested.</p>
               <p>The next evening she sat absorbed in a vague, trance-like revery. She felt that he still loved her. The strife with the world had not worn away the freshness of his heart—years had not weakened the passion she had inspired in her girlhood. Momently she expected to hear his footsteps. She fancied what a smile his face would wear, when he knew that the Grace of his love and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">L'Inconnue</foreign> of his admiration were one and the same.</p>
               <p>A laggard tread came up the walk. It was too slow for him. She opened the door, and a messenger handed her a note. She came back to the light, and for a moment she held it with the seal unbroken. A sudden memory thrilled her heart. The last time she had looked upon that familiar superscription, its enclosure had well-nigh brought her death. The old, bitter grief surged up into her soul, but she controlled her emotion after a time, and tore it open. Only a few words were traced there, and she read them over and over again.</p>

               <p>Turning the note over and over, she sat there in the lamplight, until the little Hose crept to her lap, and passed her dimpled fingers over her mother's face. "Mamma's face all wet. What make mamma cry? Please smile little bit at Rosie." Then, clasping the baby-comforter to her breast, she realized that her tears were born more of joy than grief, and from her heart swelled up a silent thanksgiving.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Warren Hereford was borne onward toward New York. It was mid-afternoon when he reached his home. "How is Mabel?" he faltered forth to the girl who answered his summons' "Worse," was the reply, and he turned toward his sister's chamber with a hesitating step, as if he feared to enter. But there was nothing there to mark the presence of the death angel. It was a lovely April<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7298-00000200"/> day. White muslin curtains, lined with rose-color, were looped up at the windows, and the spring sunshine lay warm and bright on the rosewood furniture. Bunches of spring flowers stood in vases, scattered here and there about the room, and in a little glass on a stand by the sick girl's bedside, was a bouquet of wild-wood blossomS. Percy Douglass had walked out into the country and gathered them, that morning, while still the dew lay fresh upon their petals. There were violets and anemones, and the tiny, pearl-like bells of the wild crocus. Mabel could not see them, but she knew their separate fragrance; she could call them each one by their names, and she loved to take their dainty leaves in her thin fingers.</p>
               <p>Percy had been with her from the commencement of her illness. Though she had refused to be his wife, yet well he knew that it was for his sake the delicate, peach-like bloom had died out of the wan cheek. He would talk hopefully, sometimes, of her recovery. She must be his bride yet, he would say. When she got stronger they would be married, and he would bear her far away, where suns of Italy should brighten the flowers in her pathway, and winds of the South woo the life and warmth back to her cheek with their kisses. She would listen with a smile very sweet and happy, but when drawing her head to his bosom, he would whisper—"My wife," she would answer softly—"Yes, in Heaven;" and Percy hoping, praying, with the might of love's despair, yet saw her fading day by day.</p>
               <p>Once, kneeling by her bedside, he had besought her with prayers and tears to be his, even then—to let him go down beside her into the night, even if the new name, Mabel Douglass, could but be written upon her tombstone. But her face contracted with a sudden look of rain, for his words brought back the memory of that long night of trial, the sorest that had swept over her young life. "Do not ask it," she murmured with passionate earnestness—"it is wrong, it is wrong." After that, he had forborne all attempts to change her resolution, and contented himself in cherishing what still remained of that beautiful life, with a love which combined the worshipping idolatry of the lover with the tender care of a woman.</p>
               <p>He sat beside her, as Warren Hereford threw open the door. Emmie, now Simon Goldthwaite's cherished wife, sat by the window, and Mrs. Hereford, swaying to and fro in her arm-chair, watched mournfully the young, fair features of her blind child, whereon, alas but too distinctly, she could read the sentence of death. When Warren entered, the blind girl was the first to speak. His heart fairly trembled and stood still, as he noted the fearful change four months of absence had wrought in his pet sister. And yet his eyes had never rested on a fairer object. No dream of poet or of painter was ever purer or more seraphio<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7298-00000201"/> in its beauty. Her small, graceful head lay lightly against the snowy pillows piled beneath her shoulders, and the curls, soft and sunny as an infant's, clustered in rings about her forehead. One hand lay in the clasp of Percy Douglass, the other she extended to her brother. "You were so good to come," she said, gently, "I so longed to see you before I died." From a child, she had thus spoken of <emph>seeing</emph> those she loved, and yet, for the first time, Warren noticed it, and then he thought how dark had been the path over which those young feet had trod. To her, the summer sun had never risen with its wondrous glory. No moon of winter had silvered the life pages for her eyes, no stars of midnight ever cheered her with their long-enduring hope; and now, through these dark ways, she was groping onward to the great end, her patient hands outstretched toward the shadow-lands of death.</p>
               <p>He drew near the bed, and holding her once more on his breast, wept for the young life which had not been strong enough to climb the steep paths of earth, and so had plumed its wings for heaven.</p>
               <p>The next three days passed like a painful dream. Her spirit was losing its hold on human love, and eyes of lover and mother, brother and sister could only watch and weep. Once more it was afternoon. All her loved ones were gathered around her. Kate Hereford stood at the bed's foot. Softened by this great sorrow, she no longer looked like the haughty, defiant Kate Cunningham of other years. She had loved Mabel better than any other living thing except her husband, and now her proud eyes had grown very dim with tears and watching. The old gray-headed rector had just administered the sacrament of the Holy Communion, and now the dying girl lay in the calmness of her heaven-sent faith, like an infant, smiling in its dreams of heaven.</p>
               <p>"Come and kiss me, all of you," she murmured. "Nay, Kate, do not sob so. You would not keep me here when the summons has come for my departure. Dick, Simon, Emmie, dear ones all of you; my own brother Warren, ah, I know you will think lovingly of the absent Mabel. It will be hardest for you, my own sweet mother; but you have nurtured your blind girl tenderly, and when she passes from your sight, it will not be long ere you can come to her side in heaven, and I shall see you there. You have made life very fair and bright, so that I have almost forgotten the one sorrow which has darkened it. And you, Percy—"</p>
               <p>Her arms clung convulsively to his neck, and the watchers by that dying bed saw that this was the bitterness of death—"Percy you will love another. I would not have you mourn very long for Mabel. Let other eyes look into yours, eyes that can give you glance for glance; other love make you happier than mine ever could—and yet I would not be quite forgotten. Think tenderly, sometimes, of the blind girl who<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7298-00000202"/> loved you too truly to be your wife, whose young life withered for your sake, and perhaps God will let me look down from heaven and rejoice in your happiness. Hold my head on your bosom once more, please, and let me go to sleep."</p>
               <p>Pale, silent, tearless, he held her in his arms. For a half-hour she lay there quietly, then for an instant her eyes opened. "Oh light," she whispered, "oh joy, mother, Percy, I see you all," and once more the lashes drooped downward, and the young heart had beat its last throb. To the eyes so dim on earth, the sunshine of heaven was very bright, she looked on the Beautiful City and the Great King—the <emph>Blind Eyes saw.</emph>

               <head>XXIX. IN WHICH WARREN HEREFORD MEETS AN OLD FRIEND.</head>
               <p>IT was the beautiful Southern May-time, a season of flowers on the banks of the Potomac. Warren Hereford had returned to Washington that day, and now he was standing on the deck of the evening boat for Alexandria. He was very sad. Less than three weeks before, he had followed his blind sister to her dreamless rest in Greenwood. What was it to him now, that opening blossoms were keeping holiday along the banks of the beautiful river? what, that the spring-birds sang, and winds chanted pleasant ballads? and what, that the voices of his countrymen were uplifted in praise of his eloquence and his integrity. She was dead, and the sounds of all the voices in the world could not reach her ear, down under her coverlet of violets; the perfume of all the blossoms could not call one smile to the cold, still lips. What wonder that life seemed worthless as an egg-shell? But there was one who suffered yet more deeply; the<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7298-00000203"/> young lover who had never called her wife. Percy Douglass had turned away from that quiet grave of his buried love, to a life which seemed to him dim, and terrible, and ghastly as a skeleton crowned with flowers. Warren shuddered at the contemplation of this wilder grief, and only roused himself from his sorrowful reverie, as the boat touched the pier. He walked hurriedly toward the little vine-wreathed cottage which Grace called her home. Tapping at the door, he recognized in the person who admitted him the well-known face of Irish Mary. He had not seen her since the old days at Mount Vernon Street. "Cousin Elsie" had been a most brilliant success, and Grace had employed the first fruits of her triumph in adding a few simple comforts to her humble home, and bringing Mary back to share it with her. Warren's voice faltered, as he said a few kind words of recognition. Even the poor Irish girl had changed, during the long, weary years; she was so different from the fresh, young Mary who used to kindle his fire in the cold winter mornings. He passed into the little sitting-room. Grace rose to welcome him, but she turned very pale as she met his glance. "Mabel," she faltered, "how is Mabel?"</p>
               <p>"Dead, Grace; buried in Greenwood!"</p>
               <p>His tone was calm, but its suppressed anguish thrilled to her heart. She sprang forward with a quick, impulsive cry, and throwing her arms round his neck, buried her face in his bosom. "Dear Grace," he murmured, fondly putting back her hair, "you pity me; or, Grace, can it be—do you love me still?"</p>
               <p>There was no more room for pride, no more motive for concealment. Fearlessly the blue, tearful eyes sought his face, and the low, tremulous voice answered—"I have loved you all the time!"</p>
               <p>"Thank God," was the fervently uttered response, and then for a while he held her there in silence. Lifting her face at last, so that he could read those truthful features, he asked, "But, Grace, how is this? Why did you reject me so haughtily, if you loved me still?"</p>
               <p>"Because I was proud, and I was wicked. When I was poor and friendless, I would not turn to you. It seemed as if we should never have parted, had I been rich, and I couldn't marry you until I had raised myself above want."</p>
               <p>"And now?"</p>
               <p>It was beautiful to see the woman's pride struggling through her tears. She rose and placed in his hand a note for five thousand dollars; so rapid had been the success of her book. "I am <foreign xml:lang="FRA">L'Inconnue,</foreign>" she whispered.</p>
               <p>"You!" He caught her rapturously in his arms. "You, and I never even suspected it. Ah, Grace, it was not strange that book thrilled me so; that it seemed so like a leaf out of my own heart. My pride,<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7298-00000204"/> my treasure, my heroic Grace! And now you will be my wife?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you will take me and Rosie."</p>
               <p>"She shall be ours now, the darling; mine as much as yours; and Grace, we must be married this evening,"</p>
               <p>"This evening? Impossible."</p>
               <p>"Not at all. Oh, Grace, you don't know how I need you, how I have needed you all these years. And now, with this great sorrow to bear, I must have you to comfort me, to teach me to look from that mound in Greenwood up to the blue heaven bending lovingly over us all. I cannot wait; I could not have a ceremonious wedding, while my heart is clinging with such passionate sorrow to the dead. Since you love me, what matter if you give up one or two established notions for my sake, and come to my home on shorter wooing than your woman's pride would dictate?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Warren, it is not pride. I have had enough of that, but it seems so soon after Mabel's death."</p>
               <p>"The more reason that I need your love and sympathy. Let me send a messenger for Joseph?"</p>
               <p>"To-morrow morning," she pleaded; "give me till then."</p>
               <p>"Be it so. To-morrow, at ten, you must be ready, Grace, I can thank God for all the past now."</p>
               <p>The next morning there was a quiet bridal. They were wedded in the little cottage where "Cousin Elsie" had been written. Rose, clinging to her mother's hand, stood with them before the clergyman, and when the last words of the ceremony had been pronounced, Warren turned, and folding them both in one embrace to his heart, murmured—"My wife, my child!"</p>
               <p>A week after, a question of great importance was before the House. Warren had carefully prepared himself, and the members in their seats, the ladies in the galleries, were bending eagerly forward in absorbed attention. And one there was among the listeners, whom Warren Hereford's eye sought oftenest; a fair, meek woman, with the wife-like pride and tenderness beaming in her soft eyes. He had been speaking for some time, when, glancing round among His audience, he saw another face. Prouder it was, and more intense, more passionate in its expression, perhaps more beautiful. It was the face of Juno Clifford. She had followed him, even here, and there she sat, magnificent in silk and diamonds, watching him with the old look in her eyes. His thoughts went back to another scene, years before. Once more he seemed to stand as the valedictorian of his class. Once more those two were before him, the fond mother, the sweet, innocent betrothed. Juno's tones of tenderness came caressingly back to his ear, but the husband who had sat beside her on that commencement morning had gone alone to the "Far-off Land," and a great gulf,<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7298-00000205"/> which fondest memories could not bridge, lay between him and the mother of his adoption.</p>
               <p>Leaving the Capitol that day, with his quiet little bride, in her deep mourning, leaning upon his arm, he found himself face to face with Juno. For the first time in years they spoke. "Mother," he said, in the calm tones she so well remembered—"this is my wife, Mrs. Warren Hereford." It was wonderful to see that haughty woman's self-control. She bowed and offered her congratulations, with a cold, mocking civility, and then moved away, without one change of feature to tell how that proud heart was humbled. The next day she left Washington for ever.</p>
               <p>It was the bright midsummer before Warren Hereford knelt with his wife, to receive his mother's blessing. The next day the whole family went together to the grave of their blind Mabel. It was a sweet spot. Willows waved over it, wild roses and honey-suckles twined lovingly around the headstone, and there stood a marble cross, oil which was graven that sweet name, Mabel. Their thoughts were not all sad, as they stood grouped about the spot. Already the mother's feet were nearing the shore of the invisible river of Death, but her loved ones were beside her, and it seemed sweet to think that on the other side would beam for her a welcome from the blue eyes, sealed on earth, which only heaven's sunshine had power to open. Hither, to this peaceful grave, for many a year, a lonely wanderer will come with the voices of the spring-time. Percy Douglass will never marry, and to him it is as the <foreign xml:lang="ARA">Kaaba</foreign> of the world. Standing among the glorious ruins of Italy, or floating with the bargemen adown the castled Rhine, no matter how many leagues of sea and mountain lie between, each year, will come with the spring-time a yearning impulse to look upon that sculptured cross, to stand beside that grave. The tenth day of each year's April, he will kneel beside that tombstone, and keep a tryst with the dead—the one love of his lifetime. He will do so till the last.</p>
               <p>It is Christmas day. I close my eyes, and two pictures stand out clear and distinct upon the canvas of my mind. In the quiet home where Emmie Goldthwaite dwells with her husband, a family group is gathered. Years of married life have left almost unchanged our Little Sunbeam. The sweet face is fair as ever, and the proud and happy Simon syllables her pet name with the old love-tones. Warren and his Grace are there, with the little Rosebud, Malcom Hastings' child. Dick stands by the window playing with Emmie's little girl. They have called the child Mabel, in memory of the dead, and Kate cherishes her almost as fondly as she does her own little Harry, laughing and crowing on his grandmother's knee. They<pb n="408" xml:id="VAC7298-00000206"/> have all known sorrow, but its memory only falls soothingly upon their present happiness, softening and subduing it, as the low chimes of distant dirge notes, floating over the waves, deepen to tears of joy the exquisite tenderness of gay and happy hearts.</p>
               <p>Another picture. In Juno Clifford's sumptuous mansion a merry party hold their Christmas revel. She moves among them, queenly and radiant. She cannot live without this mirth around her, to hush to silence the fiends whose voices echo so mockingly. But the folds of silk and velvet cannot still the weary throbbing of that lonely heart, and when they are all gone, and she is alone with the memories of her lifetime, the outbreak will be terrible. Her scorned, slighted love will rise up clamorously, and then will sound from out the lapse of years her husband's voice, and the quadroon will stand by her side the while, like an attendant demon.</p>
               <p>Heaven be thanked that the scales which mete out life's joys and sorrows tremble not in the hands of Omnipotence. The Christmas day is dying, the fire goes out upon the hearthstone, and my task is over.</p>
