LJFFOI&amp;amp;! !"&#xD;
It was~ but a single word-a single tono-a BitI~&#xD;
gle name, but it betrayed all the agony in her&#xD;
heart, and by the soft moonlight, the tears which stood&#xD;
in her eloquent eyes were visible..&#xD;
Steeling his heart against the better impulses 6f his&#xD;
nature which wer~e struggling for the ascendancy, and&#xD;
iiot trusting himself to glance at the grief-stricken girl so&#xD;
fondly loved, lest it should unman him, he said:&#xD;
"Yes, Gertrude, my father demand's it, and to save&#xD;
his gray hairs from a prisoner's cell, my happiness must&#xD;
be sacrificed."&#xD;
us words were quick and hurried, and it was evident&#xD;
he would have spared his betrothed this cruel blow, had&#xD;
not a high sense of honor driven him to make her his&#xD;
confidante.&#xD;
"Oh, God! then it is true?"&#xD;
These words came with a gasp, and the next instatlt%*&#xD;
the trembling, weeping girl was folded to a heart which&#xD;
was as deeply lacerated a~ her own. Rie tears mingl&amp;amp;d&#xD;

THE TERRACES.&#xD;
&#xD;
with hers, and they were iiot unmanly, for in that mo-&#xD;
ment of speechless agony, the fate of two lives was being&#xD;
decided. Should it be separation and misery, or shQuld&#xD;
it be disobedience and happiness? Should. the son be&#xD;
sacrificed for ~the father, or should the father become a&#xD;
martyr 'for his boy? These were the questions which&#xD;
forced, 'themselves upon Clifford in the trying hour here&#xD;
recorded.&#xD;
A mother's heart would have answered,: "Burn me&#xD;
at the stake, hut spare my child-"&#xD;
But, a father's heart?&#xD;
W14 ~dl1 be its reply? We shall see! -Nothing could&#xD;
j&amp;amp;~8~utiful than the devotion of these two young&#xD;
: ~ ~or they loved each -other because their ~ouls&#xD;
K #e~ In ~c~~ord. Thus far, their lives were skinless, their&#xD;
rnoti~es pure, their4ntentions good, their hopes hNght;&#xD;
~ut they, like all the rest, nust ~ay for th@ transgression&#xD;
in the garden ~\nd judging from present ~pearances,&#xD;
thefr sorrows wer9 to begin early in life.&#xD;
It was a gala-night at The Terraces, those far-famed&#xD;
gardens which have been deservedly immortalized ib song&#xD;
and story, and which are equally celebrated for sly flirta-&#xD;
tions and match-making, to say nothing of tender vows,&#xD;
of whispered words of love, of stolen glances, and of&#xD;
dreams - too beautiful to last. This earthly paradise,&#xD;
*    which lay just beyond the outskirts of the beautiful vil-&#xD;
1~ge of L-~-~, stretched over acres upon acres; and was&#xD;
adorned with fountains and summer-houses, and hedges,&#xD;
and flowers, and evergreens, which bewildered the mind&#xD;
as it took in the scene. It was the wedding-night of the&#xD;
only daughter of the proprietor of these famous grounds,&#xD;
and as these two lovers sat in a secluded summer-house&#xD;
&#xD;

THE TERRACES.                13&#xD;
&#xD;
in a state of crucifixion, the music- of a fine orchestra was -&#xD;
wafted .to them upon the soft warm night-air, and their&#xD;
happy companions were flitting in the dance. Thus, the&#xD;
lights and shadows 1of life are ever blended, and it is&#xD;
strange how forgetful the joyous can be of all but their&#xD;
own happiness, and how oblivious the wretch&amp;amp;l can be of&#xD;
all btit their own misery. WomanIy~in her grief, as in&#xD;
her love, Gertrude's whole being was shocked by this nn~&#xD;
expected blow, and but for the little self~.contro1 which&#xD;
Clifford at length commanded, this painful interview&#xD;
might have been imprudently prolonged. Finally, crush~&#xD;
ing down his own feelings, and clinching as with a vi~e~.&#xD;
the desire in his heart which pleaded for sympathy, he&#xD;
attempted to console her, from whose pathway he would&#xD;
*&#xD;
have banished every shadow-to soothe her whom he was&#xD;
called upon to sacrifice for a father's honor.&#xD;
Raising her head, and kissing her brow, he said ten.&#xD;
derly:&#xD;
"Do not weep, Gertrude;" but the torrent poured&#xD;
afresh, and he might as easily have stayed the tempest4ix~&#xD;
its course. No answer came to reward his eff~i't, and in&#xD;
that moment he fully realized that the first great grief&#xD;
had come to them both; and though the wound might&#xD;
heal, the scar would go with them to their graves. ~&#xD;
No matter how palliating the circumstances, no matter in&#xD;
what way a woman is disappointed in her love, she can ueve~&#xD;
meet it calmly or with fortitude. This would be expect- -&#xD;
ing her to unsex herself. She can never understand that&#xD;
it is best for her not to love where her heart yields invol-&#xD;
untary homage, nor can she always appreciate that duty&#xD;
sometimes drives men to smother feeling as they woul4&#xD;
the blaze enkindled by an incendiary. Gertrude expert&#xD;

THE TERLRAOES.&#xD;
&#xD;
enced all this only too keenly; for disappointment was&#xD;
unknown to her, and her love was her being, her future,&#xD;
her~ alL Deprive her of that, and what were life? A&#xD;
sepulchre, whem3in would be buried aTh her hopes and&#xD;
dreams. That she loves and cannot forget, is the ce~nctth-&#xD;
emc&amp;amp; which curses every woman with soul deep enough to&#xD;
.experience the grand passion; and we say an~athemce mc&amp;amp;r-&#xD;
anatk&amp;amp; upon that false system wl4ch cultivates feeling at&#xD;
the expense of duty, and leaves one half of God's creat-&#xD;
ures with weakened hands to fight the stern battle of&#xD;
Life. Women haye to stan4 alone at the Judgm~ut; then&#xD;
why not educate them to help themselves in this world,&#xD;
instead~ of teaching them that such a thing 5s unwom-&#xD;
anly, and that they must forever lean like slender reeds&#xD;
upon some stronger support? Such false ideas are not&#xD;
only mistaken kindness, but cruel in the end, making life&#xD;
just that much harder to bear. A woman need not be&#xD;
masculine or lose one iota of her delicacy because she is&#xD;
morally strong, and no true woman will ever desire to go&#xD;
beyond the pale in which her Creator has made her the&#xD;
equal of man 'in all, but physical strength;&#xD;
The moonbeams stole quietly through the clustering&#xD;
vines, and fell like a silver sheen upon Gertrude's dress of&#xD;
rose-colored silk and illusion ; the night air wasleavy with&#xD;
the perfume of yellow jasmines and honeysucides; the mu-&#xD;
Mc jarred harshly upon the unstrungnerves of the lovers,&#xD;
and while the young girl's life seemed ebbingfrom her in.&#xD;
hysterical sobs, Clifford bent sadly over her, and a silent&#xD;
prayer went up from his heart to God which asked for&#xD;
help and guidance At last, serving himself for one&#xD;
more effort, he said tenderly and tearfully:&#xD;
"Gertrude, you forget that this marriage, will be as&#xD;
&#xD;
15&#xD;
&#xD;
hard for me as for you, or, I know, you would sympathize&#xD;
with, instead of reproaching me."&#xD;
The appeal went stuiight to her woman's heart, and&#xD;
'twixt her tears 8he said:&#xD;
"I do not reproach you, Clifford."&#xD;
"What are these tears, but reproaches?"&#xD;
"Let them flow, or I shall die!',&#xD;
"But I ask you, darling, to dry them, so that w~ can r~-&#xD;
turn to the house; for our absence may be remarked, and&#xD;
I would not compromise you for all the world;" and he&#xD;
stroked her beautiful brow as he spoke. Instantly imag-&#xD;
ining he was weary of a scene in which his sympathy was&#xD;
not equal to her own, she forced back her tears, and aris-&#xD;
ing, drew herself up haughtily, and said, in a wounded&#xD;
tone:&#xD;
"I should as soon think of dancing a~t my own funeral,&#xD;
as of returning to the ball."&#xD;
"But society and appearances compel us~ to do many&#xD;
painful things," interceded Clifford, with his usual regard&#xD;
for all the demands of courtesy.&#xD;
"213ut you see I am not a society slave; and soI will&#xD;
go home if you will escort me to the carriage."&#xD;
At another moment she would' have listened calmly K&#xD;
and heeded willingly any advice from this &amp;amp;ource*; hut&#xD;
love whispered she was betrayed-pride whispered she&#xD;
was forsaken, and womanlike, she resented the combina-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"But you have no wrappings?" Clifford said, with&#xD;
the hope of arresting a determination which he well knew&#xD;
~was more the result of pique than reason.&#xD;
"That makes no difference;" and stopping suddenly,&#xD;
where the moQli shone full in his face, she said, taunt&#xD;

"The night-air is not so cruel as men-it surely will not&#xD;
* hurt so weak a thing as a-woman"&#xD;
*    Then, with a sneer upon her faultless lips, she walked&#xD;
* like the Q~ieen of Tragedy towards the entrance to the'&#xD;
Park. With a sigh and no heart to reply to her cruel&#xD;
words, Clifford said again :&#xD;
"Will you not allow me to go to the house for your&#xD;
shawl and hood?"&#xD;
"No," was the laconic reply, as she almost flew along&#xD;
the serpentine walks, in whose intricate labyrinths had&#xD;
been passed the happiest, and now the ~nost wretched mo-&#xD;
ments of her young and uneventful life. In silence they&#xD;
'gained the carriage, and after assisting her in, Clifford&#xD;
wo~1d have entered also; but waving him haughtily back,&#xD;
'and slamming the door, she said:&#xD;
"IL prefer to go. home alone!"&#xD;
With an astonished air, he drew himself proudly up,.&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
"What excuse shall I offer to our hostess?"&#xD;
Quick as a flash ~she looked him defiantly in the eyes,&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
"Tell her that I am heart-broken, and have gone home&#xD;
to die I"&#xD;
A low, mocking laugh, which is fearful in women, fol-&#xD;
lowed these words, and then she ordered the driver per-&#xD;
ernptorily to "go on9"&#xD;
Sinking back in the carriage, she abandoned herself to&#xD;
her grief, and' reached the humble cottage of her widowed&#xD;
mother, in a state of wretchedness, which increased as&#xD;
the night dragged by, while her lover returned to the go~y&#xD;
saloon and laughed and danced and drank with a dagger&#xD;
in bi~ heart.&#xD;

&#xD;
ROUP!!!&#xD;
A name which should thrill every Georgian's&#xD;
heart with pride-a synonym for all that is&#xD;
good and great-~---recalling, as it does, one who was the&#xD;
embodiment of unswerving Principle, devotion to Coun-&#xD;
try, and fidelity to Liberty.&#xD;
A worthy disciple of Jefferson-a man who loved&#xD;
Right for Right's sake, and with the strong conviction of&#xD;
Truth on his side, fearlessly denounced frauds and ag-&#xD;
gression at home, and defied insult and tyranny from&#xD;
abroad. The champion of personal freedoTh and Stat&amp;amp;s&#xD;
Rights, and the i~itrepid author of those immortal&#xD;
words: "I entreat you, therefore, most earnestly, now&#xD;
that it is not too late, to step forth, and, having ex-&#xD;
hausted the argument, to stand by your arms!"&#xD;
Such a man was our George IMI. Troup !-one of the&#xD;
few who was not born to die-~-an honor to the country-.&#xD;
a glory to Georgia! It was not strange then, was it,&#xD;
that the Honorable Clifford Troup, Sen., was proud to&#xD;
claim even a very remote relationship with such a man&#xD;
as this?&#xD;
Nor was it singular that doubtful' means were em-&#xD;
ployed to keep such ~ graiad name untarnished, was it ?-~&#xD;
that is, untarnished before the world.' We think not, for"&#xD;

false pride, which may be reckoned as one of its greatest&#xD;
weaknesses, drives men into fatal errors, which are coin-&#xD;
mitted through want of moral force and moral discipline.&#xD;
It is the same old story which 'is familiar to many of us&#xD;
in our beloved South. Mr. Troup had been in politics for&#xD;
many years, but was at length defeated---had lived most&#xD;
extravagantly, then travelled abroad with his family-paid&#xD;
enormous sums for pictures by the old masters-threw&#xD;
away money upon celebrated statues which princes en-&#xD;
vied him-bought every pleasure which could be pur-&#xD;
chased-entrusted everything to overseers and agents,&#xD;
only drawing upon his factors, until one fine day he&#xD;
was summoned home from Europe to' find himself-a&#xD;
bankrupt! There was but one alternative. It was put&#xD;
into execution, and the "Troup Manor," the grand old&#xD;
home of his ancestors, was mortgaged. It was easy to&#xD;
obtain securities in those days of wealth and chivalry,&#xD;
and with pressing creditors eased off, the honorable gen-&#xD;
fleman again resumed the old luxurious mode of living,&#xD;
forgetting or ignoring the fact that he was no longer a&#xD;
9miilionmaire. But there were some daughters and a son&#xD;
to look after, and their future rather perplexed the affec-&#xD;
tionate (~) father.. It was only for a little while, though;&#xD;
and comprehending fully that money was the great de-&#xD;
sideratum now, the next step was to find the requisite&#xD;
number of individuals thus fortunately endowed. They&#xD;
were found, and within the next two or three years,&#xD;
which followed from that time down to the opening of&#xD;
our story, the lovely and accomplished daughters were all&#xD;
married. rou&amp;amp;~e~u~ of unusual magnificence were&#xD;

&#xD;
deeply involved every day, and what was to be the end,&#xD;
the future alone could tell. At this stage of affairs in the&#xD;
crisis, the honorable father, for the first time, began fully&#xD;
to realize that something must be done, and that speed-&#xD;
ily, for in less'than three months the mortgage had to be&#xD;
raised, or the alternative endured. This now meant~&#xD;
dishonor, if not imprisonment; for his creditors, who had&#xD;
borne with hini long and patiently, were denouncing him&#xD;
publicly and vehemently, and ~seemed bent on revenge.&#xD;
It was the beginning of the fight between the classes,&#xD;
now some thirty years ago; for although they were all&#xD;
"honorable men," yet the Hon. Mr. Troup's cotton fac-&#xD;
tors knew full well that his aristocratic doors were&#xD;
closed to them, and now that his fortune was gone, their&#xD;
doors would be closed to him. To ask a loan was out of&#xD;
the question; fo~ he had already borrowed from both&#xD;
friend and relatiVe, and having failed to meet his pay-&#xD;
ments, could not, of course, again trespass upon their&#xD;
liberality. In this dire extremity, he sat thinking one&#xD;
night, long and late. Piles of papers and books and&#xD;
ledgers and bills ~vere around him, but to look into t~iem&#xD;
now was of no avail, and could prove nothing but that he&#xD;
was a. ruined man. Until the hour which saw him so&#xD;
perplexed, he had rested in fancied security, expecting&#xD;
by a marriage between his son Clifford and Virginia'&#xD;
Dearing, sole heiress of the magnificent estate of&#xD;
"Mossy Creek," to meet his 'liabilities. The 'two had&#xD;
been betrothed in their childhood, and it was the life-&#xD;
long hope of both families to have the betrothal consume'&#xD;
mated in mar That Mr. Troup desired it for more&#xD;
reasons than one, will be readily understood, when it is&#xD;
known that he looked forward to the bridal dower as the&#xD;

last hope of rescuing the "Manor." Suddenly, he was&#xD;
awakened from this fond dream by a letter from Clif-&#xD;
ford, which aroused him to a knowledge of matters as&#xD;
they really stood, for in it his son said, " The engagement,&#xD;
which was only partial with Miss Dearing, has long since&#xD;
been broken, and I have no desire to renew it, even&#xD;
granting it should be agreeable to the young lady."&#xD;
" Broken !" thought the father, as a~ look of disap-&#xD;
pointment and perplexity knitted his brow and com-&#xD;
pressed his lips. A new dilemma-what was to be&#xD;
done i After a few moments of reflection, he thought:&#xD;
" I will tell him exactly how I am situated, and leave the&#xD;
rest to him-as my son. I fancy such a course will have&#xD;
its weight." Let no one suppose that Mr. 'Troup was not&#xD;
arn honorable man; for he was the soul of honor, and&#xD;
could his motives have been looked into, perhaps no word&#xD;
of censure would ever be uttered against him, for his&#xD;
main idea-was to pay his debts. If he had had the&#xD;
~noney, he would have paid the last dollar he was owing;&#xD;
but not having it, he was driven by pride, and a sincere&#xD;
desire to shield his name from reproach, to extraordinary&#xD;
means of procuring it. Thus do we behold the end of a&#xD;
man who had been reared to sympathize with his caste in&#xD;
thinking it not exactly the thing for a gentleman to look&#xD;
after his own business, to keep his own accounts, or to&#xD;
know aught of ledgers and day-books. Away with such&#xD;
false ideas! Let children be taught habits of business&#xD;
and industry-of prudence and economy ; teach them&#xD;
that it is a disgrace to live upon a credit and be in debt,&#xD;
and rest assured the midnight hour will never find them&#xD;
plotting for the sacrifice of their own flesh and bjood,.&#xD;
Were there no qualms of conscience in this father's heart&#xD;
&#xD;
as he sat thinking and plannin I? There were ?--for&#xD;
there was nothing mean in his n ture, and now he was&#xD;
but the creature of circumstances dnd expediency.&#xD;
IHe never dreamed-of doing what he was about to do--&#xD;
for, regardless of the future, he sought only to relieve&#xD;
the necessities of the present.&#xD;

THE DAY AFTER THE WEDrnNG.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE DAY AFTER THE WEDDING.&#xD;
OVEIRTY is ~, hard task-master, and allows but&#xD;
few privileges to its victims. So, with the early&#xD;
dawn Gertrude exchanged her ball-dress for a&#xD;
simple calico, in order to open their rooms at the usual&#xD;
hour; for her mother was a dressmaker, and by the as-&#xD;
sistance and good taste of her daughter, succeeded in&#xD;
pleasing the most fastidious fashionists in. their midst.&#xD;
Gertrude was a great pet in the village, for it was one of&#xD;
the few places on the globe where money was not wor-&#xD;
shipped to the :utter exclusion of merit; and hence it was&#xD;
that she was visited by the first and best, and invited to&#xD;
their' houses. Her father, Mr. Augustus Lawrence, was&#xD;
a man of good blood and mind, but-dissipated. That&#xD;
tells the whole story, and explains why the mother and&#xD;
daughter were left penniless to bend over the needle for'&#xD;
a~ support.&#xD;
Attracted by a pretty face, he had married the daughter&#xD;
of a plain, honest farmer-some people said for a home,,&#xD;
for you know people will talk; and it really seeme&amp;amp;~o;&#xD;
for he never raised his aristocratic finger to do a thing,&#xD;
and lived upon the old man, until driven from the roof&#xD;
by an exasperated family. This is not to be wondered&#xD;
at; for a man with "delirium tremens" two-thirds of the&#xD;
time, is not the most desirable companion in the world;&#xD;
and nothing but the love of woman can endure and bear&#xD;

with such a degraded creature. Wife-like, Mrs. Law-&#xD;
rence chose to follow the precarious fortunes of her&#xD;
drunken husband; and it was at this time that she took&#xD;
a house in the village where we find liei', and offered her&#xD;
services to the public as a dress-maker. It was a bitter&#xD;
struggle to keep the wolf from the* door, for as fast as&#xD;
the money came in, it was as quickly exchanged for&#xD;
liquor; and with shame be it written, that blows were&#xD;
sometimes given the wife, when a tiny pittance was with-&#xD;
held for the bare necessities of life. Her father had&#xD;
given her her choice, to follow her worthless husband, or&#xD;
share his home and comforts. Like a~y true wife, she&#xD;
went with I~im whom she had taken for better and for&#xD;
worse, and toiled and slaved for him, henceforth becom&#xD;
ing a~ stranger to her own family, from whom her pride&#xD;
separated her. Many times she would have sunk beneath~&#xD;
her heavy burden; but casting it upon the Lord, she asked&#xD;
Him to help her carry it, and true to fli~ word He never&#xD;
forsook her. Matters went on from bad to worse-the&#xD;
wretched years multiplied-little Gertrude grew and&#xD;
strengthened in spite of the noxious atmosphere of her&#xD;
cheerless home-.-the grief-worn furrows deepened upon&#xD;
the mother's brow, and the insatiate longing for that heW.&#xD;
ish beverage which makes brutes' of those creatures who&#xD;
are only a little lower than the angels, was finally-satisfied&#xD;
in the grave.&#xD;
Yes, Death was merciful to the wife and child; and&#xD;
after many years of torture to himself and others, the&#xD;
man, who was husband and father but in name, slept the&#xD;
la~t sleep, and no longer made his home hideous with his&#xD;
wild ravings. After this period, the wheel of fortune&#xD;
turned in ~favor of the widow, and in the course of a few&#xD;

years she was enabled to buy a little home and fit it up&#xD;
simply, but conifortably. She had her danoliter&#xD;
the best advantages of education within her reach, and&#xD;
as they had not been misapplied, she now had the gratifi-&#xD;
cation of knowing that Gertrude was considered one of&#xD;
the most accomplished girls in the town. She was much&#xD;
admired, and cotild have married well; but her affections&#xD;
having been disengaged until lately, she preferred assist-&#xD;
ing her mother and supporting herself, to wed ding for&#xD;
convenience. She had those large gray eyes, which are&#xD;
Dot only indicative of intellect, but of soul and depth of&#xD;
feeling, and they were fringed with dark-brown silken&#xD;
lashes, Which rested against a pair of delicately arched&#xD;
eyebrows of the same tint,, which looked almost black as&#xD;
they pressed against her alabaster skin. Her hair was&#xD;
almost golden, her brow low and broad, her lips red 'and&#xD;
thin, her teeth -faultless, and the rose and lily played hide-&#xD;
and-seek in her dimpled cheeks. With a nature passion-&#xD;
ate, tender, earnest, and loving, she was destined to enjoy&#xD;
intensely and suffer keenly.&#xD;
"You are up early, my darling," said Mrs. Lawrence,&#xD;
as her daughter entered the dining-room at the usual&#xD;
breakfast hour, and gave her a kiss, the morning after&#xD;
the. wedding.&#xD;
"Yes; I could not sleep, so I got up."&#xD;
"I hope you are not sick," was the anxious reply, as&#xD;
the mother noticed how pale her beautiful child was.&#xD;
"Oh,' no; I have a severe headache, which I hope the&#xD;
coffee will relieve."&#xD;
"I suppose the wedding was a brilliant affair ? ~'&#xD;
"YesJ'-sipping her coffee.&#xD;
"Of course the bride looked lovely?"&#xD;
&#xD;
25&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes "-as if not wishing to talk.'&#xD;
"And you enjoyed the evening? "&#xD;
Gertrude struggled hard to sa.y "Yes," but the falsehood&#xD;
faltered upon her lips, and as the tears caine into her&#xD;
eyes, she hastily left the room. Until lately, there had&#xD;
never been any concealment between mother and daugh-&#xD;
ter, ai d so long as the maternal breast is the confessional,&#xD;
just that long ~vill the child continue in the path of virtue,&#xD;
and be strengthened to resist temptation. Oertrude had&#xD;
committed no real wrong, but she had acted in opposi-&#xD;
tioii to her mother's wishes in receiving such marked&#xD;
attention from Clifford Troup, for with a Woman's keen&#xD;
perception, and perhaps with some ill-defined omen,&#xD;
Mrs. Lawrence feared this fine aristocrat might wiii her&#xD;
daughter's he~rt, then abandon her. So, when the time&#xD;
came, which tIle mother had predicted, it was net strong&amp;amp;&#xD;
that the daughter should shrink from confiding in her,&#xD;
and it was but nattwal that she should wish to shield her&#xD;
lover from blame and censure.&#xD;
Thinking perhaps Gertrude was only a little nervous&#xD;
from loss of sleep, Mi.s. Lawrence went quietly about her&#xD;
duties, and left her to herself. Several ladies dropped in&#xD;
duriiig the morning~.the wedding was amply~diseussed~&#xD;
the day advanced, and 'when the mother sought her child&#xD;
she found her in a deep slumber, from which she did nQt&#xD;
awaken until the sun was sinking. Surprised at the late-&#xD;
ness of the hour, she sprang quickly up, and hastily made.&#xD;
her toilette. The long nap had refreshed her wonder&#xD;
fully, and as she took that inevitably last look h her mim&#xD;

&#xD;
26         ~rm~ DAY AFTER THE WEDDING~&#xD;
&#xD;
The color deepened in her cheeks, her eyes sparkled&#xD;
with the joy which made her heart flutter, and throwing&#xD;
her arms around her mother's neck, she kissed her, and&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Oh, mother, I was so foolish and nervous this morn-&#xD;
ing; but I am perfectly well now, and as happy 'as I can&#xD;
be I"&#xD;
"I an~ glad to hear it, my daughter," returning the em-&#xD;
brace; "but come, you must not detain your friend."&#xD;
"No, I will not;" and together~ they left the room.&#xD;
Gertrude's heart beat so violently and with such wild&#xD;
apprehensions, that she feared her mother would detect&#xD;
what lay concealed therein, so she was very glad to see&#xD;
her go in an opposite direction from the parlor. How she&#xD;
came there, she scarcely knew, but a moment afterwards&#xD;
'the young gim'l was folded 'in a silent embrace to her lov-&#xD;
er's heart, and he was saying:&#xD;
"Come with me for a walk. I must talk to you, but ii&#xD;
cannot do it here!"&#xD;
Granting his 'request, they were soon strolling quietly&#xD;
and silently in the direction of The Terraces-that&#xD;
£   heaven of all other trusting spots. Happy to intoxicatiQn&#xD;
in the presence of her lover, Gertrude forgot for the&#xD;
moment the painful occurrence of the night before-or&#xD;
ig she thought of it, it was only as one recalls some horrid&#xD;
nightmare, which is instantly banished, as too dreadful to&#xD;
dwell upon. Some harrowing thought evidently obtruded&#xD;
itself upon Clifford, though; for a cloud knitted his brow,&#xD;
the dark circles beneath his eyes told of suffering, and his&#xD;
compressed lips spoke sternly of a painful determination&#xD;
about to be performed. Nature had been lavish in her&#xD;
endowments to this young man, and to almost physical&#xD;
&#xD;
perfection was added intellect of a high order, which&#xD;
would make its mark, should he be able to defy the stQrms&#xD;
which now threatened him. He was tall, finely propor-&#xD;
tioned, with an intellectual brow, deep blue eyes, a nose&#xD;
slightly IRoman~ florid complexion, and black hair, while&#xD;
a moustache and imperial of th~ same color gave him a&#xD;
di8tinguJ and rather foreign air. He was warm-hearted&#xD;
and impulsive, generous and chivalrous, fashionable in&#xD;
his dress without being foppish, and in his manners&#xD;
combined an ease and grace which only comes with&#xD;
gentle blood and polished associations. He was an.&#xD;
avowed friend and an open enemy, and it is not strange&#xD;
that men as well as women loved him, for it did the soul&#xD;
good to contemplate such a magnificent specimen of the&#xD;
human race. 'Upon looking into his clear blue eyes, and&#xD;
listening to his merry, ringing laugh, you felt quite ~ui'e&#xD;
that only the better impulses of his nature had been&#xD;
called into play, while the baser element, if there was any,&#xD;
had been kept in check by a will which could be both as&#xD;
inflexible as iron and as gentle as a woma~n's. The pur-&#xD;
ple twilight deepened into &amp;amp; darker hue, the silver cres-&#xD;
cent hung suspended in the sky, one or two stars caAme&#xD;
tripping shyly forth, and the two lovers walked silently&#xD;
along, happy in each other's presence-at least, if ~not&#xD;
happy, satisfied.&#xD;
having reached The Terraces, Clifford sought a re-&#xD;
tired spot where they would be free from intrusion, and&#xD;
being fatigued with the long walk, Gertrude seated her-&#xD;
self upon a~ grassy mound beneath an .aged oak, where&#xD;
they were partially concealed by the vines which hung&#xD;
around them in natural festoons.&#xD;

28          TIlE DAY AFTER TUE WEDD~1G.&#xD;
Throwing himself gracefully at her feet, Clifford looked&#xD;
up at her and said:&#xD;
"Gertrude, do you love me?"&#xD;
"Better than my own soul," was the earnest reply of&#xD;
this impassioned girL&#xD;
"What does love mean?" he answered, probing the&#xD;
heart which he read but too well.&#xD;
"It means everything! It means to give your life in-&#xD;
to the keeping of another, and to think it happiness to&#xD;
have no will but his! It means that there are but two&#xD;
huin'an beings in the universe, and that they are the&#xD;
world to each other! It means to live for each other, and&#xD;
if need be, to die for each other!" and her whole being&#xD;
was aglow with the feelings which inspired these words.&#xD;
"You answer well," said the unhappy lover, and it re-&#xD;
quired no small effort on his part to keep. from betraying&#xD;
the response which 'echoed in his own heart at these&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"Because I feel it!"&#xD;
"But this love of yours is a very selfish thing, Ger-&#xD;
trude."&#xD;
"Qf course it's selfish!"&#xD;
"It thinks only of the gratification of its own desires."&#xD;
"And very naturally, Clifford, foil its desires are so ex-&#xD;
acting and SQ all-absorbing, there's no time left to Punk&#xD;
of anything else;" and they both smiled at the truth of the&#xD;
picture.&#xD;
Clifford had undertaken a difficult rc~te in attempting&#xD;
to turn Gertrude's thoughts into a different channel, but&#xD;
lie managed his subject adroitly, for he proceeded skit.&#xD;
fully. Those acts are not always the most heroic which&#xD;
~re so accounted by the world, and could we look more&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DAY AFTER THE WEDDING.        29&#xD;
&#xD;
closely into men's lives, we would be amazed at the valor-&#xD;
otis deeds there recorded, as we would be forced to ac-&#xD;
knowledge that it sometimes takes more courage t~ live&#xD;
in the performance of life's duties, than it does to die.&#xD;
If. Clifford Troup had had no feeling in the matter, how.&#xD;
easy his task had been, but considering that he loved as&#xD;
deeply and as truly as Gertrude did, his conduct will&#xD;
justly place him in the front ranks of heroism. After a&#xD;
few moments of silence inwhieh he seemed serving him-&#xD;
self for the last charge, be said:.&#xD;
"how different human love is from God's love!"&#xD;
"In what particular?"&#xD;
"Human love means self-indulgence, self-gratification.&#xD;
God's love means sacrifice."&#xD;
"Sacrifice!" repeated Gertrude; and a shudder crept&#xD;
through her, as her woman's penetration comprehended&#xD;
all that this word was intended to convey.&#xD;
"Tell me what you mean, Clifford?" came with appre~&#xD;
tensions which could not be concealed.&#xD;
"I mean, Gertrude, that if my love were about to bring&#xD;
some great calamity upon your mother, that for her sake&#xD;
and your sake I should endeavor to control it-A mean,&#xD;
that if some cruel fate demanded our separation, that I&#xD;
would help you to bear it."&#xD;
The words were uttered as if by force, and well we&#xD;
know they were. Gertrude did not faint, or weep, or&#xD;
make any outward demonstration of what she was suffer-&#xD;
ing, but sat as immovably as if turning to stone. The&#xD;

the shadow he studied its every ~ature; but farniliai~ as&#xD;

her thou~ht~. While he gazed, she moved her licad&#xD;
slowly up and down, and said absently, as if to herself:&#xD;
"I understand."&#xD;
are you ready to make the sacrifice-are you.&#xD;
ready to help me?" But he waited long and a~xio~s~y&#xD;
for an a~wer, fur she whom he addPess~d seemed petri~&#xD;
fled as skhc "passed under the rod," and it was now&#xD;
evident that by the strong will she possessed, she was&#xD;
quietly serving herself for the great contest of her life.&#xD;
Clifford watched her with painful interest, for he had&#xD;
never seen her in such a mood before, and consequently&#xD;
was at a loss what to think. At last, tm'ning to him, she&#xD;
said, in a tone which ~spoke of resignation a~mid despair:&#xD;
"My love has made me powerless-I have no will but&#xD;
yours-do with me as you wish."&#xD;
The effort and the words were too much for her; the&#xD;
stron~ resQlutions of a moment before were gone, and&#xD;
she was now only a trembling, weeping, blighted woman.&#xD;
But those tears were wept upon a heart which was true&#xD;
as her own; for scarcely had the last words left her lips,&#xD;
when Clifford sprang to her side and folded her drooping&#xD;
head upon his breast. He was almost powerless himself;&#xD;
and feeling that what little strength he had was fast&#xD;
going from him, he hurried to say:&#xD;
"Gertrude, I can never leave you if you weep. Will&#xD;
you not dry your tears? Will you not. try and be strong&#xD;
for my sake?"&#xD;
"iDry your tears and be strong!" Two difficult things&#xD;
for a woman to do when her love is about to be sacr[&#xD;
ficed. But this gentle girl had some stern material in&#xD;
her, and presently she raised her head, and said:&#xD;
"For your sake, I will try!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"That's my brave girl," said Clifford, with the pride&#xD;
and love he could not conceal.&#xD;
"And now, Gertrude, since you can be strong, from&#xD;
your lips must come the final decision. Must Ii harry&#xD;
this fortune7 and save my father, or must I marry you,&#xD;
and see my father dragged to jail?"&#xD;
\Is it so bad as that?"&#xD;
"It is!"&#xD;
Another moment of painful suspense, and fearing her,&#xD;
resolution might waver, he said in a whisper:&#xD;
"Would you see your mxiother dragged to jail for your&#xD;
love? "&#xD;
"Oh, God! no-save your father, and leave me to&#xD;
die;" and with these words s1~e sank weeping upon th~&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE LAST APPEAL.&#xD;
QTIIER, it is impossible for me to yield to&#xD;
father's wishes on the subject of this marriage,&#xD;
and the more I think of it the more convinced&#xD;
do I become that I can never ask Virginia Dearing to be&#xD;
my wife. What is to be done ~"&#xD;
"Alas! my boy, I know' not."&#xD;
"Have you no influence with father?"&#xD;
"I am afraid to say," came with a high and an expres-&#xD;
sion of doubt.&#xD;
"Does he not love you?"&#xD;
"I hope so," ~she answered, with quivering lips.&#xD;
"Dyes h~ not love your children?"&#xD;
"I rust so," was the uncei'tain reply; for when she re-&#xD;
membered how he w~s sacrificing those children one by&#xD;
one, for money, she was forced to distrust his paternal&#xD;
feelings.&#xD;
The daughters who had married husbands of hi~ choos-&#xD;
ing, were mistresses of handsome establishments, which&#xD;
failed to satisfy the hunger in their hearts, and now the&#xD;
only son, the pride and the hope of the house, was to be im-&#xD;
molated upon the altar of Mammon. It was not strange&#xD;
that the mother's heart beat warme fov her last-born, for&#xD;
he was so tender and so loving, corn ning in his beautiful&#xD;
n~t~ire the gentleness of woman with the bravery of man.&#xD;
Tweiay-three summers had passed lightly over hjs head,&#xD;
and from the first moment his childish lips could lisp, they&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
had never uttered any but xvords of affection for her who&#xD;
gave him birth. Although her hair was tinged with gray,&#xD;
and her face wore that sad and chastened expression which&#xD;
comes of suffering, Mrs. Troup was still beautiful, and&#xD;
the likeness between herself and son was striking. An&#xD;
urgent letter from his father brought Clifford in haste to&#xD;
the " Manor," the grand old house of his ancestors, which&#xD;
was situated near the city of M , and it was here that&#xD;
the present interview took place between his mothei' and&#xD;
himself. Upon his arrival his father did not only entreat&#xD;
but insisted that he should consummate his marriage with&#xD;
Miss Deariug at the earliest possible moment. Clifford&#xD;
assured him that his engagement with the young lady had&#xD;
been broken by mutual consent, and that he doubted if&#xD;
she would renew it. To his sum~prise his father then in~&#xD;
formed him that the family expected him to renew his&#xD;
suit, and that he must do it, as they were pi'epared to&#xD;
answer in the affirmative. Driven to desperation by&#xD;
this most unnatural demand of his father, in the last ~x-&#xD;
tremity, Clifford sought his mother,' as children ever will,&#xD;
knowii~g only too well that when all the world forsakes,&#xD;
she clings the closer. iler love, which brightens prosper~&#xD;
ity and soothes adversity, is ever the same, and nothing but&#xD;
the love of~ God can surpass it. Mrs. Troup was in the&#xD;
"East room," as they called it, the morning that Clifford&#xD;
sought her, and as he walked back and forth the roonr in&#xD;
a state of agitation which was oblivious of everything but&#xD;
his own sorrows, she sat gazing out upon the sloping&#xD;
lawn, and her heart ached at the bare thought of parting&#xD;
with their cherished home. This feeling was only mo-&#xD;
mentary though; for, watching her boy with painful in-&#xD;
terest and remembering the unhappiness of her other&#xD;

&#xD;
children, she felt that she would gladly ,walk forth from&#xD;
the ~' Manor" a beggar and di~e of starvation, if that&#xD;
could avert the blow of misery which seemed to await&#xD;
them all. Since the last words, a wretched and pro-&#xD;
longed silence had fallen upon mother and son, and no&#xD;
longer able to control her distracted feelings, Mrs. Troup&#xD;
buried her face in her hands, her head sank upon a table&#xD;
by which she sat, and she wept. The low sobs aroused&#xD;
Cliff6rd, and softly approaching; he folded hcr in his&#xD;
arms, and laying her head upon his breast, said: "My&#xD;
poor mother!"&#xD;
He stroked her gray hair, and then, as his 'whole being&#xD;
trembled with indignation, added:&#xD;
"'Mother, if father still insists upon this marriage, he&#xD;
must be a demon !&#xD;
Quickly raising her head, and casting him from her,&#xD;
she said haughtily:&#xD;
"Clifford I I 1 blush to know that I have reared a son&#xD;
who can speak in such disrespectful terms of his father&#xD;
and my husband. Do not again utter such words as these&#xD;
'in my presence, even if your heart can harbor such&#xD;
thoughts."&#xD;
* Kneeling at her feet, he pressed her soft white hand to&#xD;
his lips, and with that chivalry which characterized the&#xD;
race, said:&#xD;
*   "Forgive me, dear mother, and I will never so forget&#xD;
myself again. But, mother, will you not plead with&#xD;
father for me? I cannot marry Virginia Dearing, for I&#xD;
love another, and to her my honor as a man and your&#xD;
son are pledged. Would you have r~e be so dishonora.~'&#xD;
ble as to break my word with a woman?"&#xD;
"No; my son, no; 'but what can I do?"&#xD;
&#xD;
TUE LAST APPEAL.&#xD;
"Go to my father; make one last appeal; pray to him;&#xD;
beg him fo enouncee this ~rueI plan, for it will not only&#xD;
wreck my happiness, but hers, who is the innocent victim&#xD;
of this fiendish scheme."&#xD;
Burying his face in his mother's lap, his tears mingled&#xD;
with hers; and the sight would have melted any heart&#xD;
save that of the weak, selfish man who stood in the&#xD;
doorway looking on and listening to the last uttered&#xD;
words of h~s son. His face was distorted with passion, for&#xD;
his tyranny was exacting, and his will knew'~no opposition.&#xD;
"That father to whom you would Isend yorzr mother,&#xD;
and the instigator 'of this fiendish scheme,' is here. At-&#xD;
tend to your own business like a man and a Troup should&#xD;
do!" and entering he seated himself beside the table.&#xD;
Taking up a paper he pretended to be reading, but the&#xD;
sheet trembled so, it was evident his indifference was only&#xD;
feigned. Both Mrs. Troup and Clifford were startled by&#xD;
this unexpected interruption, for at breakfast Mr. Troup&#xD;
had announced the determination of going into the city,&#xD;
which was some twelve .miles away, and they both be.&#xD;
lived him gone. Arising slowly and remaining quiet for&#xD;
a few moments, as if collecting all his forces, Clifford&#xD;
stood before his father and in a straightforward manly&#xD;
way, said:&#xD;
"Since it is your desire, sir, that I attend to my own&#xD;
business, I repeat what I sa~d at our interview last night.&#xD;
I ask you once more to withdraw the request which&#xD;
makes it a filial duty for me to pay my addresses to ~Nflss&#xD;
Dearing."&#xD;
His manner ~ dignified and respectful,, filling the&#xD;
father's breast ~ pride, and the mother's heart with&#xD;
anxiety. -&#xD;

87t&#xD;
&#xD;
Returning the fearless glance of his boy, Mr. Troup&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"It is too late; Miss IDearing expects you to.day. I&#xD;
made the appointment for you to call."&#xD;
"It is cruel injustice to both of us! I do not love her,&#xD;
and we both will be miserable!"&#xD;
"iDo not love her?" sneered the father. "Who said&#xD;
anything about love? Not I, surely! Love will 'not raise&#xD;
the mortgage from this estate, or giye us back our for-&#xD;
mer luxury. Let fools and womeu rave about love, but&#xD;
as a man you must understand that it is something to be&#xD;
enjoyed only when you have plenty of money and noth-&#xD;
ing else* to do."&#xD;
"Oh, Clifford," came in a h~art-broken groan from the&#xD;
wife whom he had once professed to love,, as his irreverent&#xD;
words brought her to her feet. Pain and apprehension&#xD;
and suffering were depicted in her face, and sinking again&#xD;
into her seat, she thought death would be preferable to&#xD;
outlivin~ the affections of her husband..&#xD;
b&#xD;
Outraged by these words, which somlded like bias-&#xD;
pheniy to him, Clifford advanced to his father, and lean.&#xD;
ing over him, said in a low whisper which could not reach&#xD;
his mother's ears: "Did you not love my mother when&#xD;
you asked her to become your wife?"&#xD;
"Idid!"&#xD;
"Do you not love her now?"&#xD;
"I do!"&#xD;
"The words just uttered by you, then, were cruel and&#xD;
uncalled for, and will long be remembered by me as the&#xD;
teachings of one whQm God has comnianded me to liQuor."&#xD;
Writhing under this well~meritedr lash, ~Mr. ,Troup,&#xD;
with an attempt at concealing his angersaid courteously:&#xD;
&#xD;
"You forget that it is neither becoming nor respectful&#xD;
for a son to roprove his father;" then rising, as if to go,&#xD;
he said, "Time is precious to me, as I have business to&#xD;
attend to. But allow me to ask, before going, what you&#xD;
intend to do, Clifford? Will you marry Miss Dearing?"&#xD;
"Father, I cannot, without being a dishonored man. I&#xD;
am engaged to another. I love but one woman in the&#xD;
world, and she alone will I marry!"&#xD;
Anger and consternation were both visible in the face&#xD;
of Mr. Troup, as he said sneeringly:&#xD;
"And may I a~k who this unknown, but honored (?~ in~&#xD;
dividual is? She must be a paragon among women, to&#xD;
have aroused such deep and true devotion in the breast of&#xD;
the fastidious (?~ Clifford Troup, Jr."&#xD;
Clifford remained silent under these taunts, which he&#xD;
would not have allowed from any other man, and his&#xD;
father proceeded:&#xD;
"Miss Dearing is pretty, wealthy, and well connected;&#xD;
and I say again, Clifford, that your cherished idol must&#xD;
be a Queen among the roses to so enchain your fancy!"&#xD;
His sneers were as graceful as his ~on mots, and to his&#xD;
surprise, his son answered his last taunt by saying, "She&#xD;
is a veritable queen, sir, for she i~ queen of my heart,&#xD;
and ever will be."&#xD;
"May I ask the name of this angelic creature?" sneer-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
"When you can do so, sir, with the respect due a lady&#xD;
from a gentlemriang' answered the son, imitating well the&#xD;
haughty manner of his father.&#xD;
My son!" was the gentle rebuke of his mother; but&#xD;
not noticing her interference, Mr. Troup said in quite~a&#xD;
di~terent tone:&#xD;

TIlE LAST APPEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Clifford, may I ask again the name of the lady to&#xD;
whom you are engaged?"&#xD;
"Certainly, sir," was the ready a~d courteous reply-&#xD;
"Miss Gertrude Lawrence."&#xD;
"What is her father?"&#xD;
"lIe is dead, sir! He was Mr . Augustus Lawrence-a&#xD;
eon. of Judge Lawrence, and, I believe, a classmate of&#xD;
yours.~~&#xD;
"Oh-yes-I remember Gus Lawrence well, a drunken&#xD;
vagabonds a disgrace to his family and country, who ended&#xD;
his worthless career by marrying an overseer's daughter."&#xD;
"An overseer's daughter?" exclaimed Clifford. "I&#xD;
think not, sir. He was a plain farmer, but not an over-&#xD;
seer."&#xD;
"Well, what's t1he difference? It's one and the same&#xD;
* unless they've got money. Money, you know, hides a&#xD;
multitude of faults, as well as a person's lineage. What&#xD;
of these people? Are they rich?"&#xD;
"I think not, ~ was the reluctant answer.&#xD;
"They must have something, or else how do they&#xD;
live?"&#xD;
Clifford did not reply, for although he saw no disgrace&#xD;
in the occupation of Mm. Lawrence, he knew 'that his&#xD;
father would look at it in a very different light, and lie&#xD;
even feared the opinion of his aristocratic mother.&#xD;
"Tell me, Clifford, how do these people live?"&#xD;
"By honest labor, sir!" was the manly reply.&#xD;
"And what may that honest labor ke?"&#xD;
"Dress-making, ~ir."&#xD;
"Dress-making?" exclaimed Mr. Troup; and, rising&#xD;
* from his chair, lie walked up and down the floor in a rage.&#xD;
"Dress-making, did you s~y? What, a Troup marry the&#xD;

sion, he ~vondered how his aristocratic blood could flow&#xD;
in the veins of such a creature.&#xD;
"Why not, sir, if lie loves her, and if she is a o'ood&#xD;
and noble woman, such as I know MissLawrence to be?"&#xD;
asked Clifford fearlessly.&#xD;
"I would sooner follow you to your grave, than have&#xD;
you-;" but his words were cut short by Mrs. Trotip,&#xD;
who sprang to his side, and placing her hand across his&#xD;
lips, said:&#xD;
"Oh no, Clifford-my l~usband-.---do not speak such&#xD;
wicked words."&#xD;
"And I would sooner be laid in my grave than marry&#xD;
Virginia IDearing," said Clifford excitedly. "1 will go to&#xD;
her; I will tell her I do not love her; I will tell her that&#xD;
she is the innocent victim of a man who would sell his&#xD;
soul to the devil for money; I will tell her-"&#xD;
"Oh, Clifford, do not talk thus. Forbear, I beseech&#xD;
you;" and his mother sank at his feet.&#xD;
"Mother, I must speak, and if you would not hear me,&#xD;
you must leave." Then turning to his father, who was&#xD;
standing aghast at this unexpected and defiant outburst,&#xD;
he continued: "I will tell her that hei" money is all that&#xD;
]s wanted, and that she and I will be the miserable and&#xD;
lifelong victims of aii ill-assorted marriage. having told&#xD;
her this, I will beseech her to save us both fi'om this liv-&#xD;
in~ hell."&#xD;
"My son, my son, if you love your mother, be silent."&#xD;
"Would you be silent when the gates of perdition&#xD;
were closing upon you, and you thought there was any.&#xD;
means of escape?"&#xD;

TIlE LAST API'~AL~&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE LAST APPEAL,&#xD;
&#xD;
Leaving her excited and distracted boy, she crossed the&#xD;
room, and sinking' at the feet of her husband, said:&#xD;
"Clifford, is there no alternative but this ? '~ and her&#xD;
tears flowed so that she could scarcely speak.&#xD;
"None," was the single word that fell upon her ears,&#xD;
as the death sentence falls upon the heart of some victim&#xD;
doomed to die.&#xD;
"Clifford, think-by the memory of our early days,&#xD;
those days when we were all the world to.each other-by&#xD;
the memory of those happy years which are gone, can you&#xD;
not save our boy from the sin arid misery of marrying&#xD;
one he does not love?"&#xD;
Clifford sat across the room with his head bowed upon&#xD;
his hands; but no word escaped him, and his strong frame&#xD;
trembled as the sturdy oak when shaken by the tempest.&#xD;
Recalling those youthful days of love and pleasure, which&#xD;
not even the demon of money could entirely obliterate,&#xD;
the obdurate heart of the father was at last touched by&#xD;
the appeal of her who had once been fondly loved, and&#xD;
raising her tear-stained face, he said solemnly: "Mary,&#xD;
you are both wife aiid mother; by the memory of those&#xD;
happy daya, decide between your husband aiA your 5Ofl.'~&#xD;
her Mad sank, her tears flowed afresh, and a groan&#xD;
of despair escaped her, as she thought of the difficult&#xD;
task these words imposed. She did not reply, and her&#xD;
'husband said again:&#xD;
"Decide, Mary, whether it shall be a sail for me, or&#xD;
happiness for your son."&#xD;
With terror in her face she~ said: "It is not possible&#xD;
that your creditors will allow you to be imprisoned?"&#xD;
"It is not only possible, but certain, unless some pay-&#xD;
ments are made on this mortgage. I do not a~k anything&#xD;
&#xD;
so dreadful of Clifford: I only ask him to marry a very&#xD;
charming woman who loves him, and through whose&#xD;
means he will be enabled to rescue his father from dis.&#xD;
honor, and to save the family-seat from the vile tread of&#xD;
vulgar creditors. This love which he now feels for Ger~.&#xD;
trude Lawrence is a fierce flame which will soon burn&#xD;
out, as all such passions do, and then he will learn to love&#xD;
the gentle girl whom I would have him marry."&#xD;
Never I" said. the son to himself.&#xD;
"But, Clifford," pursued the mother, "I would rather&#xD;
give up the 'Manor'to our creditors, and go forth a beg~&#xD;
gar, than knowingly and willingly sacrifice the happiness&#xD;
of one of my ehildr~n. Let's give up everything and be-&#xD;
gin life anew. What if it is. as paupers? I should wel-&#xD;
come the daily labor of a menial, if by so doing our&#xD;
children could be happy."&#xD;
But the mere idea of being a pauper strengthened the&#xD;
false Pride which ~made paternal love a secondary thing,&#xD;
and the father said':&#xD;
"Mary, you know not what you say.. Your words are&#xD;
those of a mother whose love outweighs her judgment.&#xD;
Your son sympathizes with you; ii hope he will always do&#xD;
so, for you will have need of it, when friends and fortune&#xD;
are gone, and your husband lies iii jail." The picture&#xD;
was a gloomy one, and. as the last ray of hope fled, the&#xD;
wife, in a low despairing cry, said:&#xD;
"God help us."&#xD;
Some little time passed, when suddenly a new thought&#xD;
struck the father. Slipping his arm am'oiwd the waist of&#xD;
his wife~ he assisted her from where she had sank upon&#xD;
the floor, and raising her to her feet,. they crossed the&#xD;
room to where their boy sat.&#xD;

"Clifford?"&#xD;
At the sound of his name he too arose, for these people&#xD;
were scrupulously courteous, and no amount of suffering&#xD;
could make the son forget the respect due his parents.&#xD;
They now stood very near each other, the father support-&#xD;
ing the mother, and the son resting one band gracefully&#xD;
upon the chair from which he had arisen. The father&#xD;
was grand in his proportions and looked as if born to&#xD;
command; the mother, although her form was drooping&#xD;
and her face tear-stained, was elegant and graceful; and&#xD;
the son was a fit- representative of the two-a worthy&#xD;
scion of noble ancestors. It was a toucI~ing picture, and&#xD;
one that will not be easily forgotten by those who under-&#xD;
stand and appi'eciate it in all its lights and shadows.&#xD;
Properly enough, the boy, with his youthful face, stood a&#xD;
little in the foreground, and the shadow which his body&#xD;
cast upon t~e two figures in the background would&#xD;
grow deeper and blacker as the years advanced, unless&#xD;
these two figures should abaii~on their present posi-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
After a few moments of silence, Mr. Troup. said:&#xD;
"Clifford, I made an appointment for you to call at&#xD;
'Mossy Creek,' to-day at twelve. It is now near the&#xD;
hour. Will you go?"&#xD;
The mother's heart beat anxiously as she watched her&#xD;
son, and then, looking his father straight in the eyes, he&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Do you desire it?"&#xD;
~' I ~    *&#xD;
"And you still wish, after all that~ has been said, that&#xD;
this marriage shall take place?"&#xD;
"I do."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Dishonor with one woman is not dishonor with an-&#xD;
other, according to your code of ethics?"&#xD;
"Circumstances alter cases," was the evasive reply; and&#xD;
listening to this painful cOllversatiQn, the poor mother's&#xD;
heart was tortured beyond description. An ominous si~&#xD;
leuce, like that dead calm which precedes the storm, pre-&#xD;
vailed for a few seconds, and then, like the thunder-~lap&#xD;
which is the signal for all Heaven's artillery to open fire,&#xD;
these words broke upon. the stillness:&#xD;
"Them, my ruin 1)e upon yoz~r head!"&#xD;
A shriek from his mother pierced his heart afresh, and&#xD;
rushing from the house like a madman, the son mounted&#xD;
a horse which was waiting for him, and as he flew across&#xD;
the park in the direction of "Mossy Creek," Mrs. Troup&#xD;
lay fainting in her husband's arms.&#xD;

obligations imposed by the flf(h commandment.&#xD;
".~NoUe88e oblige" was the motto upon the auciemit seal&#xD;
of the Troups, and reared as they had ever been to re-&#xD;
gard death itself preferable to the sacrifice of family&#xD;
honor and glory, they thought nothing of setting aside&#xD;
God's laws, as men frequently do for their own con-&#xD;
venience. So far, Clifford, Jr., was an exception to this&#xD;
false pride; but his father's idea was that the "Troup&#xD;
&#xD;
dynasty must be sustained~ though the heavens should&#xD;
fall."&#xD;
In thinking of it afterwards, Clifford wondered how it&#xD;
was possible for him to have offQred himself to Miss&#xD;
Pearing, when his heart belonged wholly to another;&#xD;
and perchance, there are others whose eyes will fall upon&#xD;
this page who will ask themselves the same question.&#xD;
Strange, isn't it, that men can ever gain their own con-&#xD;
sent, or can ever feel called upon by any circumstances,&#xD;
to sacrifice a woman's happiness, simply because custom&#xD;
has placed them in a position where they dan? Let those&#xD;
who are tempted by motives of interest or convenience,&#xD;
but who have not yet entered upon this uncertain road,&#xD;
reflect, and if not too late, abandon a path which will&#xD;
surely lead to misery, and perhaps to excesses which shall&#xD;
end in everlasting ruin. While Clifford and Virginia&#xD;
talked, the wretched hours dragged by; and* lit~e caring&#xD;
where they were passed so they went, the accepted lover (?)&#xD;
remained to dinner, because Mr. and Mrs. Dearing said&#xD;
he must. For days he had been nnder a fearful excite-&#xD;
ment-for two nights past he had not slept. The day&#xD;
just gone was a fiery crucil)le-rniiid and body were ex-&#xD;
hausted, and as men have done before, and will continue&#xD;
to do to the end of time, he sought relief in the sparkling&#xD;
wine. Thus, one error induces another, and where they&#xD;
shall end, the future alone can tell. Mr. Dearing's&#xD;
cellars were famous; and as he insisted upon Clifford's&#xD;
trying first one brand, then another, he rejoiced in his&#xD;
heart to find that his future son-in-law was such a~con-&#xD;
floi&amp;amp;~eur in the matter under discussion. Could men see&#xD;
the serpent that lies coiled in the sparkling beverage,&#xD;
they surely would shrink with horror from either tasting&#xD;

or tempting their fellow-creatures with such potent&#xD;
poison. But alas! they fail to see it until it is too late;&#xD;
they know not what they do, and thus do they gratify&#xD;
their appetites at the risk of losing their souls? Accus-&#xD;
tomed as he had ever been to the dangerous habit of&#xD;
drinking wine daily, Clifford was often spoken of as&#xD;
"that model young man, who never took too much."&#xD;
But from that fatal day when the errors of a lifetime be-&#xD;
gan, we fear that temperance could no longer be included&#xD;
amongst his virtues. The champagne exhilarated him.&#xD;
He had never been so brilliant, and the unsuspecting&#xD;
family regarded hin~'with feelings of pride. In the inno-&#xD;
cence of her heart, Virginia thought his gayety proceeded&#xD;
from happiness, not knowing that the prisoner bird trills&#xD;
forth its merriest lays as it frets itself to death against&#xD;
the cruel wires of its cage.&#xD;
Excusing himself immediately after dinner, Clifford&#xD;
mounted his horse, and flew along the woodland path in&#xD;
the gathering gloom. He was wretched beyond concep-&#xD;
tion; for the darkness which was settling upon his soul,&#xD;
unlike that which followed the goddess of night in her&#xD;
cheerless flight, would not be brightened by any rising&#xD;
sun on the morrow. No-the mantle of night had fallen&#xD;
upon his young life, and unless God mercifully lifted it,&#xD;
it would follow him to the grave. More distracted than.&#xD;
sane, he soon reached the "Manor," and rushing up the&#xD;
steps where his father sat, said in an excited tone, which&#xD;
was due to the wine:&#xD;
"Father, it is done!"&#xD;
"Bravo, my boy," said the father, arising and slapping&#xD;
him on the shoulder. Then. offering him his hand, he&#xD;
said:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Let me be the first to congratulate you.". But the&#xD;
extended hand was not noticed, and going down the gab&#xD;
lery to where she sat alone in the spring-time twilight,&#xD;
he threw himself at his mother's feet, and said in a tone&#xD;
of anguish:&#xD;
"Mother, pray for me!"&#xD;
Folding her arms around hi~ neck, she bent over him&#xD;
and whispered:&#xD;
"God help you, my boy."&#xD;
The father stood looking at them in anger and amaze-&#xD;
ment. It was but a moment though for the conscience&#xD;
he had so outraged gave an uncomfortable twinge, and&#xD;
entering the house, he locked himself in the library, as&#xD;
was his custom when in trouble~ Controlling himself by&#xD;
a powerful effort, Clifford Boon raised his head, and ~aidi&#xD;
tenderly:&#xD;
"Forgive me, mother! It is unmanly in me to distress&#xD;
you thus."&#xD;
"No, no, my boy; do not say so. Let me at least share&#xD;
your sorrows, since it is all that is left me to do. Would&#xD;
to God I could avert every trouble from your life-how&#xD;
gladly, how eagerly would Ido it!" co4-the d~&#xD;
"I know it, my precious mother. But&#xD;
is cast; it cannot be helped, and I must bear it like a&#xD;
man. Lot's go in, and while you pack my valise, I will&#xD;
speak to father, for I must leave by midnight in ordeE to&#xD;
catch the morning train."&#xD;
"Why so soon? ", asked tl~e mother, leaning upon his&#xD;
arm, as they walked around the gallery to the entrance.&#xD;
"Because, mother, this place is hell to me!"&#xD;
"Oh, Clifford! The 'Manor' hell to you?"&#xD;
"No, no, mother, but 'Mossy Creek;"' and seeing&#xD;

how pained she was, he said quickly: "I did not mean&#xD;
what I said, for you know I love the dear old 'Manor.'&#xD;
Have I not given my life for it?"&#xD;
Clifford, if you would not kill me, do not talk so I"&#xD;
and overcome by the despair and recklessness of her&#xD;
child, she entered her chamber and threw herself upon a&#xD;
lounge in a state bordering upon frenzy. Poor mothers!&#xD;
how often are their hearts crucified either for their chit.&#xD;
dren or by them! Theirs is a double duty, and I-leaven&#xD;
help them to carry the heavy load.&#xD;
Clifford sat by his mother and stroked her hair for a&#xD;
little while, then whispering:&#xD;
Forgive me, mother," went softly from the room.&#xD;
Her sobs followed him, and entering the dining-room, lie&#xD;
walked up to the sideboard and sought oblivion in heavy&#xD;
draughts of wine. Rapping at the library a few mo-&#xD;
ruents after he was adrnitted~ by his father, who&#xD;
said, in his courtliest manner and with his blandest&#xD;
smile :~&#xD;
"Come in, Clifford; I am glad to see you."&#xD;
"I hope you will pardon the intrusion, sir; but as I&#xD;
leave to-night, II came to~ see if I could serve you in any&#xD;
other way."&#xD;
"Why such haste?"&#xD;
"I have business which must be attended to, sir!"&#xD;
"You are right,,then, to go, for your 6u8iness (?) should&#xD;
receive your first attention. J3ut tell me, what are the&#xD;
prospects for your nomination?"&#xD;
"Alt that could be desired," was the htconic reply.&#xD;
"This is encouraging, and if you will consent to be&#xD;
guided by my advice, you will not only fill the place of&#xD;
a State Legislator, but in the halls of Congress you xviii&#xD;
&#xD;
win back the laurels which have been snatched from your&#xD;
father's brow by trickery and treachery."&#xD;
"My life is yours; ill have given it for you-Ao with it&#xD;
as you will."&#xD;
Grasping the hand of his son, Mr. Trou.p said:~&#xD;
"My noble boy, if I have given you a pang in the sac.&#xD;
rifice you now make for me, rest assured future honors&#xD;
shall obliterate even the memory of it." -&#xD;
"If that be possible," said Clifford, arising. Thenj&#xD;
with a pressure of hands, a "good-by," a "God bless&#xD;
you," the son was gone, the father was left a~lone.&#xD;
The parting between the mother and her boy was brief&#xD;
and painful, and the light of another day saw~ him going&#xD;
back tQ business-to love and to misery.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
PLAYING WITH A TWO-EDGED SWORD.&#xD;
S it strange that the flower, oversbadowe d by the&#xD;
oak, still seeks the sunlight?&#xD;
Is it strange that the prisoner, shut, in from the&#xD;
bright world, turns to the one ray which lights his gloomy&#xD;
cell?&#xD;
Upon his return to L-, Clifford made it his first duty&#xD;
to see Gertrude. Painful as the interview was,, it had&#xD;
its pleasures too, and in their sympathy for each other,&#xD;
they were like two persons walking upon the brink of a&#xD;
precipice. Notwithstanding Clifford's attempt to prepare&#xD;
her for the fatal news, Gertrude had hoped much from&#xD;
the last appeal, which she knew he had gone to make,&#xD;
and had only thought of his marriage with another as of&#xD;
something, too horrible to contemplate. She did nof be-&#xD;
lieve it possible, and banished the idea instantly when-&#xD;
ever it presented itself. Woman-like, she fancied her&#xD;
deep devotion could rescue her lover from any fate, fail-&#xD;
ing to consider that a father's cruel exactions and family&#xD;
pride could outweigh that love and crush it beneath the&#xD;
demands of selfishness, and bury it under the plea of&#xD;
filial obligation. So the blow was as unexpected as if no&#xD;
warning voice had been raised to admonish; and thus, let&#xD;
sorrows ever come, for did we anticipate, then realize all&#xD;
that is in store for us, life would be unendurable.&#xD;
For a long time Gertrude sat weeping as if her life&#xD;
&#xD;
would expend itself in sobs. Clifford 'could not console,&#xD;
~or his own heart was bleeding at every pore, and in si-&#xD;
lent misery he walked slowly back and forth the room.&#xD;
See! two crosses erected by human cruelty and human&#xD;
injustice. Duty is inscribed upon one. Necessity upon&#xD;
the other. The victims are a young man and a young&#xD;
woman; the executioner--a father.&#xD;
They go forth to the crucifixion ~ith bleeding hearts,&#xD;
and one day that blood shall cry for revenge, and in that&#xD;
day the father will cry unto the mountains to hide him&#xD;
from the wrath of his accusers.&#xD;
At length, seating himself beside her, Clifford said:&#xD;
"Gertrude, you will drive me to desperation, if you do&#xD;
not control yourself." No reply came to sustain him in~&#xD;
his painful duty, but only fresh sobs to tear his wounded&#xD;
heart. A few minutes passed, and then he said again:&#xD;
"Gertrude, do you not, can you not comprehend that this&#xD;
marriage which is forced upon me is even more painful&#xD;
to me than to you?"&#xD;
For an instant, the~ tears stopped in their briny bed,&#xD;
and with quivering lips Gertrude said, with that unrea-&#xD;
sonable persistency for which women are sometimes justly&#xD;
noted:&#xD;
"Then, why do you marry her?"&#xD;
Regarding her with painful surprise, and wondering&#xD;
how she could forget, even for a moment, all that he&#xD;
had told her of tht~ unfortunate circumstances which&#xD;
drove him to this~ step, Clifford said: "IMust I tell you&#xD;
again that my father exacts it, not only to save him from&#xD;
ruin, but as a filial duty which I owe him."&#xD;
With flashing eye; Gertrude said hastily:&#xD;
"I have a contempt for a man who thus tamely sub-&#xD;

&#xD;
mits, to the authority of any other man, even though th1~t&#xD;
other be his father."&#xD;
The flush of anger was upon her brow, and Clifford re-&#xD;
garded her in amazement as sh~ added:&#xD;
"Every man should be his own master!"&#xD;
No word left his lips at this cruel and uncalled-for re-&#xD;
tort, and burying his face in his hands, he strove to hide&#xD;
the pain which no language could express. Then an&#xD;
agonized groan betrayed what he felt but would not speak.&#xD;
Gertrude regarded him in silence. She regretted her~&#xD;
i'ash words; but for the moment, pride kept her lips&#xD;
sealed.. However, the tenderness of her woman's nature&#xD;
soon asserted itself, and as she could not bear to witness&#xD;
the suffering of one so dearly loved, she laid her hand&#xD;
~~pon his shoulder, and bending ever unti&#xD;
touched his cheek, said, in a sweet 1 her lips almost&#xD;
Clifford, forgive me!"&#xD;
As forgiveness is a Divine attribute, so is it only found&#xD;
in God-like natures among men; and with his usual ma -&#xD;
nanimity Clifford loQked up quickly, and folding his&#xD;
pretty suitor to his heart, said :&#xD;
"Thus do I forgive you;" and he kissed her ruby lips.&#xD;
Do not be shocked at what the rash lover did,~or~o&#xD;
matter how dishonorable it may appear when tested by&#xD;
the cold light of propriety, it nevertheless occurred, and&#xD;
is true to nature, notwithstanding all assertions to the con~&#xD;
trary.. And besides, we are not writing about what peo-&#xD;
ple ought to do, but about what they do---recording their&#xD;
weaknesses as well as their strength. iMien may talk about&#xD;
honor and duty and about flying from those they love&#xD;

Ustened to love's insidious language, when she felt and&#xD;
knew that by so doing she was outraging the laws of pro-&#xD;
priety and morality. Inclination sometimes conquers&#xD;
duty, and this is not so rai'e an occurrence as we would&#xD;
have pach other believe. Is it not a strange delusion of&#xD;
the brain which makes men fancy that they are honest&#xD;
and upright in the sight of the world, when they must&#xD;
acknowledge in secret that God knows how impure are&#xD;
both their motives and their actions?&#xD;
And this seems still stranger when men know that they&#xD;
must judge each other from their own stand-point, and&#xD;
what they themselves would do under similar circum-&#xD;
stances. J3ut let us stop a moment, and ask if they do&#xD;
it? No, indeed t-for what is latitude and charity for&#xD;
one's self, is dishonor and crime in another. We are5&#xD;
commanded to "love our neighbor as ourself "-who&#xD;
does it? The rule in this world is to love yourself and&#xD;
hate your neighbor-or at least to be indifferent to him;&#xD;
and let no man say to the contrary, unless he can bare&#xD;
his heart to the inspection of One whom he cannot de~&#xD;
ceive. So, let no man say that Clifford Troup acted un-&#xD;
naturally, when, in a moment of impulse, he folded to his&#xD;
heart and kissed the woman whom he loved as he did his&#xD;
own soul.. There was no crime in the action; for crime&#xD;
must be premeditated and of all men in the. world, i~one&#xD;
would appreciate the loyalty due another more implicitly&#xD;
than Clifford Troup, when the hour should arrive in&#xD;
which passion would be under the dominion of judg-&#xD;
ment. For the instant he was conquered by impulse, and&#xD;
before men shall raise their carping tongues to denounce&#xD;
his conduct as dishonorable, let them ask themselves how&#xD;
-they would act in a similar situation. Don't smile to&#xD;

yourself and say, "I would have done as he did," and&#xD;
then. say to the world, "Tie was a villain!" if he was a&#xD;
villain, he has a great deal of respectable company, for&#xD;
ninety-nine out of a hundred men would have acted just&#xD;
as he did; and remember, that no matter how much so-&#xD;
ciety may applaud your virtuous denunciations, the mo-&#xD;
ment your back is turned, your best (?) friend will laugh&#xD;
derisively, and say, "Pity* he doesn't practise as well&#xD;
as preach." A great inconsistency here-belbw, is, that&#xD;
immoral men exact the highest standard of virtue from&#xD;
their neighbors. Of course, virtue is a good thing to&#xD;
have in the world, but very inconvenient except for one's&#xD;
friends. Thus, censure coming from the most censurable,&#xD;
charity comes alone from those few who, by their blame-&#xD;
less lives, are the only ones who have a right to judge&#xD;
iheir fellow-men. And why is this? It is because ~these&#xD;
men look frequently into their own hearts.-.-they walk*&#xD;
with God-they do not endeavor to deceive either Him&#xD;
or themselves, and they have gained their own consent' to&#xD;
acknowledge that naturally their hearts are vile. This is&#xD;
the beginning of reformation, and until men confess their&#xD;
wickedness they will never have the least desire to do&#xD;
better. But remember we do not defend the conduct&#xD;
of Clifford Troup, but we do ask for him that charity&#xD;
which we all exercise towards ourselves. Fearlessly, and&#xD;
in the fear of God, with human nature for our standard,&#xD;
we propose to write the truth, according to our under-&#xD;
standing of what the truth is. We propose to lay bare&#xD;
the inner-workings of men's hearts as they daily appear&#xD;
to us; and whoever expects to find human beings idealized&#xD;
into saints, must look elsewhere than in these pages; for&#xD;
S&#xD;
we do not belong to that complacent, hypocritical school&#xD;
&#xD;
of writers, who write for the pleasure of encouraging&#xD;
somebody's ~pet sin, or for the purpose of telling people&#xD;
how they can daily violate the ten commandments, and&#xD;
then go to heaven. Two or three persons have said,&#xD;
"Why don't y~" write of pure people ?-why don't you&#xD;
have your chara~ter5 without a blemish?" We answered,&#xD;
"Because we sl~ould have to go to heaven to get th~in."&#xD;
The interrogators were dreadfully shocked, and seemed&#xD;
to have forgotten that Christ said: "Blessed are the pure&#xD;
in heart, for they shall see God." And when we remeln-&#xD;
ber that the angels are not pure enough to gaze upon the&#xD;
face of the mighty Jehovah except. when veiled, we do&#xD;
not think we have placed our standard of purity too&#xD;
high. if men had been angels, the bloody tragedy upon&#xD;
Calvary would never have been enacted; and why do we&#xD;
ever forget that Christ said, "He came not to call the&#xD;
righteous, but sinners to repentance"? Why do men re-&#xD;
sent it and even grow angry, when' told of their wicked-&#xD;
ness? We will tell you. It is because they are trying&#xD;
daily to harden their hearts more and more, so that they&#xD;
can lead a life of unlicensed freedom, without reproach&#xD;
of man or fear of God. We do not say tha't all men are&#xD;
vile, for our experience proves that there is some good in&#xD;
everybody, if we are not too blind to discover it; but at&#xD;
the same time there is room for improvement, and it can&#xD;
only come through a strict self-examination, and strength&#xD;
from above.&#xD;
Clifford Troup sought Gertrude to tell her that they&#xD;
must part. It was a bitter task, and can be appreciated&#xD;
only by those who have reared i~n idol but to see it&#xD;
snatched from them forever. They loved each other be-~*&#xD;

wooed her honorably, and looked forward with bright&#xD;
anticipations to the time when he should make her his&#xD;
wife, It may be called the law of affinity, or anything&#xD;
else that is suitable; but one thing is certain--out&#xD;
of a host of beautiful and brilliant women, Clifford's&#xD;
heart had only warmed towards Gertrude, while from a&#xD;
throng of suitors she loved but him. The disappoint-&#xD;
ment which had fallen upon them was hard to bear; it&#xD;
tested all their fortitude, and left their young hearts torn&#xD;
and bleeding. lit was a solemn occasion, and the mutual&#xD;
~acri1iIce there made, would influence their future for&#xD;
good, or evil. If men would only half appreciate how&#xD;
deeply love and matrimony affect their lives, there would&#xD;
be no need of divorce laws, for every home would be an&#xD;
Eden upon earth, and every nation would be more ele~&#xD;
vated by the purity, the virtue, and the happiness of it~&#xD;
people.&#xD;
There was no disloyalty in Clifford's heart to Virginia&#xD;
Dearing, when he went to pay a last visit to Gertrude;&#xD;
fQr he went as an honorable man, to explain to her 'the&#xD;
necessity of asking for a release from an honorable en-&#xD;
gagement, which, until the night in question, had not&#xD;
been positively broken. But love was stronger than&#xD;
honor, and he lingered longer than honor required, and&#xD;
was guilty of acts which can only be pardoned upon the&#xD;
score of feeling, and the weakness of human nature.&#xD;
When he entered that house he believed himself strong&#xD;
enough to say "good-by," and to go there no more.&#xD;
Strong! Who is strong when battling with a great love?&#xD;
Then, men are but as the reeds with which the tempest&#xD;
toys. and plays, and bends and breaks! For the time&#xD;
they ~re powerless; for there is no slavery so perfect, no&#xD;

tyranny so exacting, as love. It was growing late, but&#xD;
Clifford lingered, and poor Gertrude clung to him as if&#xD;
eternity were waiting to snatch him from her forever.&#xD;
In those few hours of painful bliss, he forgot pride, fame,&#xD;
honor, father, mother, betrothed, everything&#xD;
lie only remembered that he was retreating into dark-&#xD;
ness, while the gates of heaven were closing upon him.&#xD;
He only remembered that life would henceforth be a liv-&#xD;
ing death to him.&#xD;
Is it strange that he lingered? Is he not to be for-&#xD;
given, aye, and pitied? They had actually been laugh-&#xD;
ing, even as men will trifle with their souls upon the 'very&#xD;
brink of hell. But the clock told one, then two, and&#xD;
rising abruptly, as if he would tear himself away, Clifford&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Gertrude, I must go!"&#xD;
"Oh, no, no, no, Clifford. Do not leave me!" and the&#xD;
frantic girl clung to him as a person will when the death-&#xD;
grasp clutches some cherished one in its cruel embrace.&#xD;
Finally, comprehending that his honor no less than the&#xD;
reputation of her he loved demanded that he should&#xD;
leave, Clifford said, as if powerless to act for himself:&#xD;
"Gertrude, send me away I"&#xD;
Between her tears, she said:&#xD;
"I       ~,,&#xD;
"Then I must tear myself away. Good-by ; "~ and&#xD;
snatching a hasty kiss, he reached the door without daring&#xD;
to trust himself to look back.&#xD;
A moment more and all would have been over, but&#xD;
just then a cry of anguish s~dd: "Clifford," and once&#xD;
again he returned to her from whom it was so hard to go.&#xD;
"You'll come again?" ~he asked pleadingly.&#xD;

CIIAPTER VII.&#xD;
OF COURSE!&#xD;
S the days and weeks went by, and tjie fatal hour&#xD;
of separation drew nearer, Gertrude and Clifford&#xD;
became more reckless in their desperate but&#xD;
hopeless love. The weekly visit, which honor suggested&#xD;
might be paid to a friend, soon became semi-, then tri-&#xD;
weekly, then daily, then twice a day, and all uncon-&#xD;
sciously this infatuated pair found themselves lingering&#xD;
at The Terraces, strolling in the moonlight, enjoying'&#xD;
silent conversatiollS on the porch, exchanging rose-buds,&#xD;
~and indulging in~ all those delicious little nothings which&#xD;
go to make up the sums totum of happiness for lovers.&#xD;
For a time their misery would be forgotten, or if remem-&#xD;
bered, it would be only to give new zest to a love&#xD;
which was becoming dangerous from its very intensity.&#xD;
Thus will all passions conquer, when uncontrolled, and&#xD;
he who expects to emerge from such a contest as this un-&#xD;
scathed, counts upon strength which ~o man possesses.&#xD;
The Troups had taken special pains to speak often and&#xD;
publicly of their son's approaching marriage with Virginia&#xD;
- IDearing, for the honorable father, with his usual sagacity,&#xD;
fully comprehended that this would be the most effectual&#xD;
means of silencing the insulting clamors of his impatient&#xD;
creditors. It had its effect, and for the first time in many&#xD;
months, Mr. Troup experienced what a relief it was not&#xD;
to be harassed hourly and daily by pi'essiug debts. The&#xD;

&#xD;
rumor was not slow in wending its way to L-, and as&#xD;
the latest bit of news, it was discussed, with all its varia-&#xD;
tions, in the rooms of Mrs. Lawrence one day. Half a&#xD;
dozen ladies had dropped in that morning apparently for&#xD;
the purpose of debating the fashions; but Mrs. Lawrence&#xD;
thought scandal took precedence in the conversation, as&#xD;
she quietly listened to the dissection, in detail, of at least&#xD;
half the village. She was fitting a dress for Mrs. C&#xD;
when Mrs. B- said:&#xD;
"Have you heard the latest news?"&#xD;
All eyes were instantly~turned upon the speaker, and&#xD;
Mrs. .G.-~---- said:&#xD;
"No. Wiiatisit?"&#xD;
Why, 'they say "'[those invisible but sleepless report-&#xD;
ers] "that Clifford Troup is to be married very soon to&#xD;
Virginia Dearing, the heiress!" for she was known by this&#xD;
title all over the State.&#xD;
"Why, you don't say so?" said one.&#xD;
"You don't tell me?" said another.&#xD;
"Why, you amaze me!" said a third; and exchanging&#xD;
eignmcant glances they all turned their eyes, in vulgar&#xD;
interest, upon Mrs. Lawrence, for the whole town knew&#xD;
of Clifford's devotion to her daughter.&#xD;
They obserVed unanimously that her hands trembled-.--.&#xD;
that she dropped a pin or two, and that her face crim-&#xD;
soned at Mrs. U-.-.-.'s announcement. She made no&#xD;
comment, however, and after an awkward pause in the&#xD;
conversation, Mrs. C-.---, who hated ever to hear of any&#xD;
one's good fortune, said, with a curl of the Jip:&#xD;
"Better be born lucky than rich."&#xD;
"But it doesn't seem that he considers himself lucky&#xD;
or that he desires to b&amp;amp; rich," said Mrs. J3- ; and as all&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes were turned upon her in eager curiosity, she added,&#xD;
"for 'they say' he doesn't love her, ~nd that he is only&#xD;
marrying her to keep his father from ruin, and to raise&#xD;
the mortgage from the '~Manor."'&#xD;
"So that's it," said Mrs. G ,and for the second time&#xD;
they all glanced at Mrs. Lawrence, who quietly proceeded&#xD;
with her work and said nothing.&#xD;
"Oh, yes," said Mrs. C-, "I've heard people talk&#xD;
that, way before, but show me one man who marries for&#xD;
love, and I'll show you forty-nine who marry for money."&#xD;
"Oh, Mrs. C-.--, how intensely material you are!"&#xD;
simpered the lisping Mrs. F-, who sat over in the cor~&#xD;
ner.&#xD;
"Material or whatever you choose to call it, Pm&#xD;
only telling a truth which may be applied to both sides&#xD;
of the house," answered Mrs. C-, "for as a general&#xD;
rule, women much prefer jewels, handsome dresses, line&#xD;
houses, fast horses and elegant carriages, to so much love;&#xD;
and men think it very comfortable to have a wife who&#xD;
can foot her own bills if need be, with a rich old father&#xD;
to back her in case of an emergency."&#xD;
The chivalry of many men will enter a public protest&#xD;
against this attack upon them, but down in their hearts&#xD;
we suspect they will'~gree with Mrs. C- in thinking&#xD;
it very nice to have a wife with an extra deposit at the&#xD;
bank.&#xD;
"You are candid, at least, Mrs. C.-," said one of the&#xD;
ladies.&#xD;
"Yes, but I only say what other peoPle think," re-.'&#xD;
plied Mrs. C-.&#xD;
"Judge not;" said Mrs. B&#xD;
"There now, I think* that will do, Mrs. (I-~---.," said&#xD;

&#xD;
Mrs. Lawrence, as she completed the difficult task of fit-&#xD;
ting a waist for her, and considering how much she had&#xD;
to be filled out in some places, and taken in in others, it&#xD;
was no wonder that the poor dress-maker's heart misgave&#xD;
her when attempting to give satisfaction to such a lean (?)&#xD;
subject. Stepping to the mirror and examining it in&#xD;
every detail, Mrs. 0- said, rather reluctantly, and as if&#xD;
not entirely satisfied:&#xD;
"Yes, I suppose that will do."&#xD;
"Why, I think it fits perfectly," said Mrs. B-.&#xD;
CKIIf you desire any alteration, point it out, and I will&#xD;
take pleasure in making the change," said Mrs. Lawrence&#xD;
with a quiet air of resignation.&#xD;
"Oh,* no; that will do;"and with a shrug of the shoul-&#xD;
ders she took the garment off and threw it impatiently&#xD;
upon a chair; she was evidently dissatisfied, and if the&#xD;
truth must be told, it is doubtfM whether an angel from&#xD;
heaven could have pleased her. Thus do persons profess-&#xD;
ing to be ladies sometimes forget that those who labor&#xD;
for them have feelings as well as themselves. Politeness&#xD;
is so cheap and~ yet so rare! What a pity it can't be&#xD;
bought like commodities of necessity, for then, it is to be&#xD;
hoped, all men would have a share of it. But alas, money&#xD;
can never buy what must come alone from goodness of&#xD;
heart-a br ad arity, and a desire to make every one&#xD;
hapj~y. Thjs, then, is the secret of true politeness-this,&#xD;
then, is the secret of its rarity. During this little side-&#xD;
scene, the conversation had drifted into other channels,&#xD;
and after assisting Mrs. 0-.- with her toilette, Mrs.&#xD;
Lawrence took up the unoffending garment, when one of&#xD;
the ladies said to her:&#xD;
"The styles seem very little, changed from last season."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes," she answered; and handing her home new con-&#xD;
gravings, added: "even in these latest cuts there is noth-&#xD;
ing particularly new."&#xD;
"No, nothing but what we have had;" and with the&#xD;
exchange of 'some other trifling little' nothings, the half&#xD;
dozen ladies went forth upon their mission of scattering&#xD;
and gathering, and Mrs. Lawrence was left alone. With&#xD;
a moan she sank down, and the hands which had so much&#xD;
to do fell listless at her side, as she realized, in all its coni-&#xD;
pleteness, the unhappy condition of her child. This, then,&#xD;
explained the late capriciousness and nervousness of Ger-&#xD;
trude, and with a woman's quick perception, Mrs. Law-&#xD;
rence knew all the misery of her child's heart, without&#xD;
ever having been made its confidante. Ah! mothers,&#xD;
mothers! it is not enough that we must suffer ourselves,&#xD;
but we must share the sorrows of our offspring as no other&#xD;
bosom can, and this is the cruelest penalty of woman-&#xD;
hood. To suffer for ourselves is nothing, but to see the&#xD;
blood of our darlings dripping from every pore; to feel&#xD;
that the light is going out of their young lives'; to know&#xD;
that they are wretched-this is worse than death. It was&#xD;
now too late to remedy, but Mrs. Lawrence felt that some-&#xD;
thing must be done. to avert any further calamity. The&#xD;
unexpected, and to her', distressing news, had so paralyzed&#xD;
her, that she was powerless either to think or act, and&#xD;
turning at last to her neglected work, sought relief in&#xD;
employment. It had also been. a trying morning for Ger-&#xD;
trude; for she had been visiting some young friends, and&#xD;
turn where she would, they twitted her with her lover s&#xD;
early marriage. Writhing under their taunts, yet laugh-&#xD;
ing to conceal her real feelings, she at length, heart-sick&#xD;
and weary, dragged herself home, as the wounded hind&#xD;

lies her to her den, to die. How' she wished in those&#xD;
ho~irs of tearless agony that she could lay her head in&#xD;
her mother's lap, and weep as she used to do in the days&#xD;
that were gone. What a relief she thought it would be!&#xD;
But no-rather than bring censure upon her lover, or re-&#xD;
proaches upon herself, she would bear her sorrow alone.&#xD;
Thus, while the daughter thought only of concealing her&#xD;
misery from her in whom she should have confided every-&#xD;
thing, the mother thought only of how she could rescue&#xD;
her child from the dangerous meshes which seemed tight-&#xD;
ening around her each moment. So the gulf was widen-&#xD;
ing, and where there ~should have been but one heart-&#xD;
throb, the mother and daughter were as~-strangers.&#xD;
* Would to Heaven we could reach the hearts of all the&#xD;
girls in the world, and impress ifpon them the necessity&#xD;
of confiding in their parents, hut more especially in their&#xD;
mothers, for here their safety lies. We would not then&#xD;
have lived in vain, for that life would be spent to some&#xD;
purpose, which could enforce upon the minds of young&#xD;
women the importance of never doing aught which could&#xD;
not be sanctioned by their mothers and their God.&#xD;

*     CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
TIlE SAGE OF "PLEASAliT RETREAT"&#xD;
ONGIRESS had just adjourned, and the Hon.&#xD;
all United States Senator, immedi.&#xD;
ately repaired to "Pleasant Retreat," his cown-&#xD;
try seat in Middle Georgia, with an unusual yearning for&#xD;
its quiet and retirement. The session just ended had&#xD;
been a busy and an exciting one, and this far-seeing&#xD;
statesman painfully comprehended that the feeling of&#xD;
hatred between the sections was daily increasing. His&#xD;
country was his pride, and loving it only next to his soul,&#xD;
he regarded these unmistakable forebodings with sad ap-&#xD;
prehensions; f~r it must be remembered our story ~iates&#xD;
back some thirt$~ years ago, when the conflict between the&#xD;
sections was assuming a formidable shape. Mr. flail was&#xD;
sole lord and master of his old-fashioned country farm-&#xD;
house, which he would not have exchanged for a palace;&#xD;
and as he had never married, he was dependent for homq&#xD;
comforts upon the attentions of faithful and devoted ser4&#xD;
vants who ministered cheerfully to his few wants, for con.-&#xD;
sidering everything superfluous except actual necessities,&#xD;
he would allow them to do no more. The building was&#xD;
a frame house, t~vo stories high on the front, with an eli&#xD;
running back in the rear. II~anding in the hall, were an.&#xD;
tique and winding stair-ways; in the chambers were those&#xD;
high-post bedsteads, remindu~g one of their great-grand-&#xD;

&#xD;
mothers; and in every appointment of the quaint establish-&#xD;
ment was to be found comfort, without any pretensions to&#xD;
luxury or finery. There were blazing fires with doors&#xD;
wide open, in genuine Southern style, and any number of&#xD;
sleek, well -fed negroes and pet-dogs standing idly around&#xD;
the premises. In the lawn, the grand old oaks, which&#xD;
evoked one's reverence, had never been touched by the&#xD;
sacrilegious axe of the woodman, for the statesman loved&#xD;
nature more than art, and would never permit them to be&#xD;
disturbed. In one corner of the grounds stood a church,&#xD;
which the gen*~i6sity of this great and good, man erected&#xD;
for the worship of the honest, upright people who lived&#xD;
in his immediate neighborhood. Some persons said it&#xD;
spoiled the looks of the place, but to us it enhanced its&#xD;
interest, saying more eloquently than words could ever&#xD;
have done: "I acknowledge the existence of a God,&#xD;
whom I worship. Come thou and do likewise.~~&#xD;
In the parlor were two or three family portraits, an en-&#xD;
graving of the members of the Senate in their chamber&#xD;
at Washington, listening int~~itly to a speech by one of&#xD;
the immortal triumvirate, Webster, and an engraving of&#xD;
one of Georgia's most brilliant sons; but generally speak-&#xD;
ing, these bachelor quarters were' destitute of those little&#xD;
decorations which bespeak not refinement so much as&#xD;
the presence of woman. In the eli of the house, which was&#xD;
separated from the main building by an open hall, were&#xD;
two rooms library and bedroom, where the Sage lived;&#xD;
and there, *hen he was at home, not only were his doors&#xD;
wide open ~o all who came,, but his waitm, generous heart&#xD;
was. ever ready with sympathy and consideration for his&#xD;
fellow-men. There ~words of wisdom fell from his 1ip~i&#xD;
for the yoa~Ig; words of comfort for the afflicted*; words&#xD;
&#xD;
of consolation for the bereaved; encouragement for the&#xD;
struggling; pity for the erring; charity for all-no matter&#xD;
whether they were high or low, rich or poor, white or&#xD;
black, no human being was excluded from a share in his&#xD;
regard, for he scorned nothing which God had made. On&#xD;
the contrary, he considered it a privilege to do whatever&#xD;
lay in his power for any and all who came within the&#xD;
range of his circle.' How beautiful is old age when toned&#xD;
down and Boftqned~ by the noble acts and charitable deeds&#xD;
of a lifetime; and to those who knew Mr. llall's~ inner&#xD;
life, he was not more admired for his grand intellect, than&#xD;
revered for his goodness of heart, for no matter how&#xD;
plausible a man may be, he will never be able to impress&#xD;
mell's hearts when his own life is false.&#xD;
Above his study mantel hung an engraving ~f Riche-&#xD;
lieu, which was alone in its glory. This picture ~vas sug-&#xD;
gestive, for it 'showed the bent of the man's thoughts,&#xD;
who rarely did anything without a motive; and as the&#xD;
great Cardinal loved France, so did this statesman love&#xD;
Georgia  The life of Reuben Hall had been a rugged&#xD;
one, and the fact that he sprang from obscurity, unaided,&#xD;
into a Senator's chair only demonstrated what grand&#xD;
things a man of ability, of will and energy may achieve&#xD;
'in our glorious Republic. llere,.thanks to our free in-&#xD;

made deep inroads upon a constitution naturally delicate,&#xD;
and that now he was almost a walking shadow. So that,&#xD;
although not quite fifty, his frame was attenuated, his&#xD;
movements infirm, his complexion sallow, while his clas-&#xD;
sical features were as closely cut as if chiselled from&#xD;
marble. his long, white hair was brushed back from a&#xD;
broad, intellectual brow, and his black eyes, which were&#xD;
startling in their brilliance, gave evidence of the immor-&#xD;
tality within, while they seemed gazing into the very&#xD;
depths, of one's soul. They were eyes, which once seen,&#xD;
were never forgotten, and by the magic of their power&#xD;
made men with guilty consciences most uncomfortable,&#xD;
lest they should penetrate their hidden secrets. A week&#xD;
or so after his return home he was sitting in his bachelor&#xD;
quarters, with "Rio," his favorite dog, dozing at his feet,~&#xD;
when his reverie was interrupted by the entrance of~Paul&#xD;
Maxwell, the son of an old friend in the village near by.&#xD;
I~he young visitor was studying law with the Sage, and&#xD;
coming in through the open doors unannounced, he said,&#xD;
in his frank, hearty, manly way:&#xD;
"Good-morning, Mr. Hall !"&#xD;
"Good~m6rning, Paul!" and extending his emaciated&#xD;
hand, it was warmly'grasped by his young friend.&#xD;
"I brought your mail, sir, and hope I find you better,&#xD;
this beautiful morning."&#xD;
"Yes, I am better Paul, but still suffering from fatigue&#xD;
mind and body;" and he looked as if laboring under'&#xD;
depression of the whole nervous system..&#xD;
"You tax your strength beyond its powers, sir; but&#xD;
now that we have you at 'Pleasant Retreat' once more,&#xD;
we will make you well before you leave us again."&#xD;
But Mr. Hall made no reply to these kind words, f~r&#xD;
&#xD;
running his eye hastily over his numerous papers and&#xD;
letters, a certain handwriting arrested his attention. It&#xD;
was instantly recognized, although years had elapsed since&#xD;
he had seen it. With trembling fingers he broke the&#xD;
seal, and read the following:&#xD;
"L-, GA., Hay-, 18-.'&#xD;
"Mv D11~A1~ BROTHER :---With the old love beating warm as ever&#xD;
in my heart for you, I 'break through the silence which my own&#xD;
pride and obstinacy has imposed upon us. But, brother, I beg&#xD;
that you will forgive me, for I am now conscious of having done&#xD;
wrong, and God knows I have suffered deeply for it. I now have&#xD;
a new trouble to encounter, and remembering the good, kind heart&#xD;
which beat in your bosom years ago, I hope I shall not appeal to&#xD;
you in vain for counsel and sympathy. With no father or husband&#xD;
to advise me, whom else should I seek but you? My daughter,&#xD;
Gertrude, has now grown into a beautiful woman, and lately has&#xD;
formed a most disastrous attachment for a young lawyer in our&#xD;
midst. The attachment is mutual ~ but the father of the young&#xD;
man being heavily in debt, urges hi~ son. into a wealthy alliance, in&#xD;
order to extricate himself from his financial troubles. Although&#xD;
very unhappy at the proposed marriage, he yields to his father's&#xD;
desires, leaving poor Gertrude the victim of love~ and disappoint.&#xD;
ment. She is terribly depressed, and melancholy beyond descrip.&#xD;
tion; and I fear her health will be seriously injured, unless there&#xD;
is some change. It is most unfortunate for her that the young man&#xD;
lives in the village, and still. insists upon visiting her, although his&#xD;
marriage is near its celebration. I think perhaps, if I could send&#xD;
or take her away, that it would be beneficial both to her health and&#xD;
spirits. Will you advise me what to do?&#xD;

was forgotten, for all his numerous overtures of kindness&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
NOT NOW.&#xD;
ITH feverish impatience, and in a state of uncer-&#xD;
tainty, Mrs. Lawrence awaited a reply to her let-&#xD;
ter, for remembering how she had almost scorned&#xD;
her brother's every kindness, she was rather doubtful of&#xD;
its reception. It came earlier than could have been ex-&#xD;
pected, for the mails were slow in those days of staging;&#xD;
but the time seemed long, for suspense is worse than fatal&#xD;
reality. She read it over and over again, although it&#xD;
contained only the following:&#xD;
"PLEASAWr RETREAT," 2fay -, 18-.&#xD;
"DEAR MAROARET: Come to me, and bring Gertrude.&#xD;
"Your brother,&#xD;
"REun1n~ HAIL."&#xD;
Mrs. Lawrc~nce was not surprised at its brevity, for she&#xD;
remembered her brother to be a man Qf few words, yet&#xD;
she could not doubt but that the welcome messenger&#xD;
came from a kind and sympathetic heart. Then, as memn-&#xD;
ory drifted back to the happy~ days of their childhood,&#xD;
and the subsequent years of estrangement, the floodgates&#xD;
of her heart were opened, and she wept over the long&#xD;
train of shadowy events which had saddened her life.&#xD;
Indulging her tears but for a little while, she arose, and,&#xD;
with a mother's unwavering devotion, prei5ared some del-&#xD;
icacies for dinner, in the hope of tempting the appetite&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8257-00000036"/>&#xD;
NOT NOW.&#xD;
of her unfortunate child. The quiet of the graveyard&#xD;
had fallen upon their once happy home, and Gertrude's,&#xD;
merry song and gay laughter no longer echoed through&#xD;
the cosey little cottage. There were now only sighs arid&#xD;
tears, and silence, and the wretched girl glided noiselessly&#xD;
about the house like a spectre. She was pale to ghastli-&#xD;
~iess, and the dark circles beneath her eyes told a silent&#xD;
tale of suffering. The luxuries which her 'mother's kind-&#xD;
ness had prepared were untasted, and after sipping some&#xD;
'coffee, she quietly left the dining-.room. Tearfully and&#xD;
sorrowfully Mrs. Lawrence looked after her, and as her&#xD;
heart was too full ~to eat, she too arose from the table&#xD;
without touching a morsel.&#xD;
Despite the advice and protestations of Mrs. Lawrence,&#xD;
Gertrude received Clifford daily, saying:&#xD;
"It will be only ~or a little while, mother. Bear with&#xD;
me for when Clifford is married, my life will be over."&#xD;
iNo mother's heart could have resisted such an appeal&#xD;
as this, no matter how mudi her judgment disapproved&#xD;
what she consented to, and believing that Clifford loved&#xD;
her daughter as sincerely as she loved him, Mrs. Law-.&#xD;
rence thought it better to let them meet under her roof&#xD;
than perhaps clandestinely elsewhere, as lovers sometimes&#xD;
do. Thus seven weeks of excruciating torture had passed&#xD;
over the heads of these two wretched young people, and&#xD;
on the 4ay of final parting they were no more reconciled&#xD;
to, or prepared for i~, than when the bell of necessity first&#xD;
tolled the knell of separation. It will be a matter of&#xD;
surprise that Gertri~rde's pride did not prompt her to' a&#xD;
different course, and some may say, "~o girl of spirit&#xD;
would-have acted as she did."&#xD;
But it will not be the first time people have tried to de-&#xD;
&#xD;
NOT NOW.&#xD;
&#xD;
ceive their own hearts, nor will it be the last time that they&#xD;
will be reminded of the fact that love is stronger than&#xD;
pride. Besides, there is no shame in a pure love like this,&#xD;
and instead of condemning its victims, rather let us scorn&#xD;
the false sentiment which would teach us to crush a feeling&#xD;
which is God's chief attribute, and which He has seen&#xD;
fit to implant in our natures. The world considers Ger-&#xD;
trude jilted, and regards her with pity, if not contempt.&#xD;
But we, you and I, know better. We know, that if there&#xD;
is truth in man, that she was loved as sincerely as she&#xD;
loved, and that she and her lover were but the creatures&#xD;
of unfortunate circumstances which forced them to do&#xD;
what they must, not what they would. Has no one ever&#xD;
been so situated before? If not, life has been unusually&#xD;
kind to them, and they should have some little charity&#xD;
for those who have not been so. fortunate. Pity the&#xD;
woman, and pity the man, for the crucible through' whose&#xD;
scorching flames 'they were passing deserves our commis-&#xD;
eration more than our censure. In their blind worship&#xD;
they forgot that the Lord God is a jealous God, and&#xD;
made idols of each other, but to see the altar with its&#xD;
images shivered to atoms by the avenging hand of Him&#xD;
whose laws they had disobeyed.&#xD;
Clifford had not borne the approaching separation with&#xD;
even such poor fortitude as Gertrude commanded, and~hia&#xD;
friends remarked that he was depressed and moody, and&#xD;
that, at times, his face was flushed and his manner excited.&#xD;
On several occasions he visited Gertrude with the odor of&#xD;
liquor on his, breath, and when she remonstrated, 'he&#xD;
would say: "I wish that I could drink myself to death,&#xD;
or else drop dead at the altar. What have I now 4o live&#xD;
for? All my hopes are blighted, all my ambition is go~,&#xD;
4&#xD;

~4.           NOT NOW.&#xD;
&#xD;
and the future to me is one black page of misery and&#xD;
necessity."&#xD;
At length the final separation was over, and while Ger-.&#xD;
trude abandoned herself to her grief, and Clifford went&#xD;
to the marriage-feast as if to his funeral, the good citi~~&#xD;
zens of L-.--. were in a delightful flutter over a bridal&#xD;
party whk~h was to be given by Judge Baker, the uncle&#xD;
and law-partner of the groom. The invitations had been&#xD;
issued the day before, everybody was invited, and this,&#xD;
more than the last adieu, made Gertrude realize that it&#xD;
would now be a crime to love where her heart went forth&#xD;
in one wild bound like the surge dashing against the&#xD;
shore. flaying completed her household duties, Mrs.&#xD;
Lawrence joined her daughter, and sitting beside her on&#xD;
the lounge where she was lying, said: "Darling, I have&#xD;
a letter from your ~Uncle Reuben!"&#xD;
"Indeed! and what does he say, after his long si*&#xD;
lence?"&#xD;
"lie says I must come to see him, and bring you; an4&#xD;
I came to see if you would not like to go at once?".&#xD;
"Not now, mother!" with a sigh.&#xD;
"Why not now, my darling ~" asked the mother anx-&#xD;
iously.&#xD;
"Because-," was the faltering and unfinished reply,&#xD;
while the tears sprang to her eyes, and the blushes dyed&#xD;
her pale cheeks.&#xD;
"Because what, Gertrude?" asked the mother with&#xD;
painful anxiety, as she regarded her child with fresh ap-&#xD;
prehension. "You are ill, my darling, and nothing would&#xD;
do you so much good' as change of air and scenes. Why&#xD;
will you not go, Gertrude? Tell me. Do not conceal&#xD;
anything from pie."&#xD;
&#xD;
N'&#xD;
&#xD;
NOT NOW.                 7&#xD;
&#xD;
Freighted, as 'the appeal was, with a mother's tears, it&#xD;
had its effect, and looking up, Gertrude said:&#xD;
"Because, mother, I promised Clifford I would attend&#xD;
the party at Judge Baker~s.~~&#xD;
Comprehending what additional suffering this new&#xD;
trial would impose, Mrs. Lawrence said:&#xD;
"My darling, I fear you over-estimate your strength.&#xD;
Do you think you are strong enough for this ?"&#xD;
"Strong enough?" exclaimed Gertrude; and springing&#xD;
from the lounge with some of the old fire, she walked&#xD;
hastily back and forth the room with a determined air,&#xD;
'which bespoke a will ready to fulfil its. resolutions to the&#xD;
letter. Her mother regarded her in painful silence, for she&#xD;
feared that this was but the recklessness which comes of&#xD;
despair. .INeither spoke, until after' a few minutes, Ger-&#xD;
trude turned and with the old smile of ~happy days play-&#xD;
ing around her beautiful mouth, said:&#xD;
"Do you not see, mother, that the very thought of it&#xD;
makes me strong? And did you suppose that I would&#xD;
run away for the gossips to say I was afraid to meet Clif-&#xD;
ford's bride? Comet mother, where's your pride? You&#xD;
should advise me differently."&#xD;
"But suj~pose, with the eyes of the whole town upon&#xD;
you, you should tremble or become embarrassed, or faint&#xD;
when you are presented to the bride?"&#xD;
"Never fear, mother;" and the .same reckless laugh&#xD;
which' fell upon the midnight air that night at The Ter-&#xD;
races, accompanied these words, and made the mother&#xD;
shudder. "Never fear, mother, for I'll bear myself like&#xD;
a queen, and a~s your daughter should." Then coming&#xD;
close up to her mother, she said ahw5st in a whisper, as if&#xD;
&#xD;
75&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8257-00000038"/>&#xD;
NOT NOW.&#xD;
afraid even of the walls: "For if my heart breaks, the&#xD;
world shall not see it."&#xD;
"And you will not   now?" asked the mother with&#xD;
a heavy 'sigh.&#xD;
"Kot now, mother."&#xD;
*" When shall we go, then? Decide, for I must write&#xD;
at once to Reuben."&#xD;
"Sometime soon-say in two or three weeks;" and&#xD;
when Mrs. Lawrence left the room, Gertrude threw her.&#xD;
self again upon the lounge, overcome by a paroxysm of&#xD;
tears, which was the inevitable sequence to the undue&#xD;
excitement which preceded the result.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
LOVE AND HONOR.&#xD;
FIlE party was at its height, and the parlors were&#xD;
blazing with light and beauty. A quadrille was&#xD;
just finished, a the grounds and colonnade&#xD;
and halls and windows and stairways were crowded&#xD;
with lovely women in tulle and silks and satins, and with&#xD;
men in the inevitable blaek suits, all of whom were chaP&#xD;
tearing like so many blackbirds. But there was a hush,&#xD;
as Gertrude, leaning upon the arm of Frank iMiorgan,&#xD;
passed through their midst, for her marvellous, beauty&#xD;
silenced conversation for the moment. Her dress w~as.&#xD;
faultless, consisting of a white illusion underskirt with&#xD;
puflings which were divided by pink moss-buds, with a&#xD;
light-blue satin tunic and bodice trimmed to correspond,&#xD;
while coral jewelry and a single. rosebud in. her hair,&#xD;
completed this exquisite toilette.&#xD;
Her large gray'eyes sparkled with unusual brilliance.&#xD;
-excitement gave something like a heeti~ ~1ush to. her&#xD;
~heeks, and she bore herself proudly as she wept grace-&#xD;
fully forward to where the bridal party stood.. Every&#xD;
eye in the room was turned upon her,. but she bore tho~&#xD;
.battery of glances without flinching, and after pay1n~ her&#xD;
respects to the host and hostess, was presented by Judge&#xD;
Baker to the bride in these words:&#xD;
"Mrs. Troup, permit me to present Miss Lawrence,.&#xD;
one of your husband's. best friends, and Mr. Morgan~"&#xD;
&#xD;
LOTh AND HONOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8257-00000039"/>&#xD;
118             LOVE AND UONOR.                                             LOVE AND HONOR.             79&#xD;
&#xD;
The hands of wife and rival were clasped, and without&#xD;
the slightest embarrassment, Gertrude said:&#xD;
"I am happy to welcome you to L&#xD;
To which the little blue-eyed, brown-haired bride,&#xD;
in white silk, illusion, point-lace and orange-blossoms,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
", You are very kind."&#xD;
This was all; and as Gertrude took Frank's arm with&#xD;
the intention of' passing on, Clifford, who stood convers-&#xD;
ing with a lady near by, turned and offered his hand,&#xD;
evidently desiring not to be forgotten. Taking it, Ger-&#xD;
trude said, with her sweetest smile:&#xD;
"I'm glad you are here, for I always make it a point&#xD;
to extend my congratulations to the husband."&#xD;
For some reason or other, Clifford could not command&#xD;
hi~ usual readiness, and so he was very glad when his&#xD;
little wife said:&#xD;
"And why to husbands more than to wives, Miss&#xD;
Lawrence ~"&#xD;
"Because, women are all angels Q) you know, but&#xD;
men-it remains to be~seen what they are."&#xD;
"You are complimentary, as usual," answered Clif-&#xD;
ford, scarcely knowing what he said, y~t feeling forced&#xD;
to say something.&#xD;
"Oh, with all your faults, I like you still-that is,&#xD;
your sex, I mean," she answered, with an attempt at a&#xD;
smile, and an increasing constraint which fortunately no&#xD;
one else detected.&#xD;
"Honey and aloes," replied Clifford, bitterly, for this&#xD;
trifling was absolutely painful to him; and as he saw&#xD;
how artificial 'even Gertrude could be, he doubted for&#xD;
the moment the earnestness of all women, forgetting&#xD;
&#xD;
what hypocrites society makes them, forgetting what des&#xD;
caption custom demands at their hahds.&#xD;
"Miss Gertrude, this is our dance," said Frank Mor-&#xD;
gan; and without replying to Clifford, she took the arm&#xD;
of her escort, and as they moved off, looked over her&#xD;
shoulder, and smiling to the bridal couple, said:&#xD;
" I'll see you again.~~&#xD;
So the little farce was over, and those who looked on&#xD;
could detect nothing to criticize in what appeared to be&#xD;
only an indifferent meeting between two society people.&#xD;
Thus do we read each other, and while our hearts are&#xD;
breaking, we go laughing and dancing, even down to the&#xD;
brink of the grave.&#xD;
"May II see your card?" said Clifford a few moments&#xD;
later.&#xD;
"Certainly," said Gertrude; and when he returned it,&#xD;
his name was, down for the next quadrille.&#xD;
4Z~ertrude had never been gayer than on this evening,&#xD;
and her old admirers, whom she had almost cut lately,&#xD;
felt very much encouraged by her kindness towards&#xD;
them. She was the centre of a group ~f these old&#xD;
friends, and the sparkling witticisms and brilliant sar-&#xD;
casms which fell from her pretty lips; inspired them with&#xD;
new admiration. However, they were not destined' to&#xD;
enjoy this charming conversation long, for after a little&#xD;
while, the bridegroom led her away, saying:&#xD;
" This is our dance.~~&#xD;
Understanding that for her sake and his own it was&#xD;
ne'~essary he should pay her some attention, Clifford had&#xD;
asked Gertrude to honor him with a dance, more forth&#xD;
purpose of silencing the tongues of busybodies, than be-&#xD;
cause he felt like participating in any gayety.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8257-00000040"/>&#xD;
Silently and 'in a stately manner, they walked through&#xD;
the quadrille, without exchanging even so much as a&#xD;
word or a glance, and to a stranger they would have ~p-&#xD;
peared like the negative and positive poles meeting; but&#xD;
to those who were familiar with the recent events of&#xD;
their lives, they looked like what they were-two people&#xD;
trying to do their duty in spite of fate and feeling.&#xD;
The quadrille over, Clifford slipped Gertrude's hand&#xD;
through his arm, and passing out at one of the windows&#xD;
walked down the colonnade to where some chairs sat in&#xD;
the shadow of a column.&#xD;
They sat there £Qr a few mQments in silence; then Ger~&#xD;
trude said:&#xD;
"This is very imprudent."&#xD;
"And who cares if it is," said Clifford, recklessly&#xD;
"I care for nothing, f~r I love but you."&#xD;
Rash words these, if not dishonorable, and to be attrib~&#xD;
uted -to the influence of wine, for we are convinced that&#xD;
Cliffoid Troup's high sense of honor would never have&#xD;
permitted him to use such language had he been him..&#xD;
self. Arising, and standing before him in all the majesty&#xD;
and grandeur of a woman who feels that the hour has&#xD;
come in which she must either save or damn, not only&#xD;
the man she loves, but herself, Gertrude said:&#xD;
"But if you are the honorable man I take you to be,&#xD;
you will tear this love from your heart;" and God above&#xD;
only knows what an effort the words cost her.&#xD;
"Is this what you would have me do?"&#xD;
"It is."&#xD;
"Is this what you intend to do?"&#xD;
By God's help, it is;" and turning her eyes to&#xD;
'heaven, ehe stood for a moment in an attitude of prayer.&#xD;
&#xD;
No more heroic act was ever performed than this, and&#xD;
there is every reason to hope and believe that God will&#xD;
be merciful to the woman who can make her love the&#xD;
safeguard instead of tl~e ruin of the man she loves.&#xD;
There was a bowing of the head, a pressure of the&#xD;
hands upon the eyes, a harrowing pang through the heart,&#xD;
a low moan, a stifling pause, and arising, Clifford offered&#xD;
Gertrude his arm, and theyreached the ball-roominsilence~,&#xD;
Here a partner who had been in search of her claimed&#xD;
her, and the next moment saw her whfriing in a waitz~&#xD;
Regarding her for an instant, then walking coolly~away,&#xD;
Clifford thought to himself, "Illow we do trifle with the&#xD;
most sacred feelings of our hearts!"&#xD;

THE ARRI~VAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XL&#xD;
THE ARRWAL.&#xD;
WO weeks later, as the shadows were lengthening&#xD;
and the sun was sinking, the cars came puffing&#xD;
slowly along, and stopped at the village of&#xD;
C&#xD;
Mrs. Lawrence and Gertrude stepped on to the platform,&#xD;
wl~ere they were met by Mr. Hall, who said, with gentle&#xD;
voice and a look of tenderness in his eyes:&#xD;
"How d'ye, Margaret?" t~ which she replied, "How&#xD;
d'ye, Reuben P' and shaking hands, the greeting1 be-&#xD;
tween the brother and sister, who had been separated&#xD;
for so many long years, was over. No doubt they loved&#xD;
each other as well as those ~ho are more demonstrative;&#xD;
but in their early education they had been reared to re-&#xD;
gard kissing and such other little mannerisms as forinali-&#xD;
ties properly belonging to the outside world, and hence&#xD;
it was that they were not overly punctilious about those&#xD;
triflingg. ceremonies which are so beautiful in the home&#xD;
circle. Without any premeditation or particular ambi-&#xD;
tion to inaugurate a new era in her mother's family, Ger-&#xD;
trude put her arms around her uncle's neck and kissed&#xD;
him,. simply because he was her uncle. From that instant&#xD;
his good, kind heart opened to her, and this one little un-&#xD;
studied act of tenderness paved the way to years of future&#xD;
love and devotion. So it would seem that while kisses&#xD;
may not be sought from an old, gray-haired and wrinkled&#xD;

sister, they may be very acceptable from a young and&#xD;
pretty girl. Exactly-oh, the old sinner! But then,&#xD;
there are few men who would not be v~quished under.&#xD;
such circumstances, even granting they opposed these se-&#xD;
ductive things upon principle; only, we never heard of one&#xD;
who did.&#xD;
"And this is my little Gertrude ?~"' he said, taking her&#xD;
face between both hands, and looking into her eyes.&#xD;
"Little?" she said, smiling. "Why, I'm almost as tall&#xD;
as you.~~&#xD;
"And a beautiful child you are, too," he answered, still&#xD;
regarding, her. Then turning to his sister, he added:&#xD;
"how like her father!"&#xD;
Without noticing his last words, Mrs. Lawrence said,&#xD;
with deprecating look and tone:&#xD;
"But beauty is spoilt, Reuben, when the owner be-&#xD;
comes conscious of it."&#xD;
"Oh well, Margaret, I don't suppose. anything an old&#xD;
man says will turn the girl's head,. but it might if it&#xD;
came from a fine young fellow like this;" and as Paul.&#xD;
Maxwell then joined them, Mr. Hall presented him to&#xD;
th~ ladies. And indeed he was "a fine young fellow,"-&#xD;
not what women would call handsome, for his nose was&#xD;
too prominent and his features too irregular; but, accord-&#xD;
ing to Napoleon's standard, the men~ with noses are the-&#xD;
men who make their mark, and according to our obser-&#xD;
vation this is a very good .rule to judge by. . Paul was&#xD;
tall; and riding horseback. and hunting and living much&#xD;
in the open air, hs1d given him a physical development&#xD;
which was remarkable for so young a man. His ha~eL&#xD;
eyes were fearless and truthful, his brow too prominent&#xD;
for beauty, and his mouth firm and compressed, bespeak-&#xD;

&#xD;
ing will and determination. In his manners he had all&#xD;
that easy grace and polished gallantry which character-&#xD;
izes the true Southern gentleman; and as he stood with&#xD;
uncovered head in the presence of* the ladies, we cer-&#xD;
tainly thought with Mr. Hall, that he was "a fine young&#xD;
fellow.&#xD;
"Is the' carriage ready, Paul ?" asked Mr. Hall, after&#xD;
the usual compliments had passed between himself and&#xD;
*th~ ladies.&#xD;
"Not just yet, sir. The horses were afraid of the cars,&#xD;
and 'Harry' said he wohld drive down the road until the&#xD;
train was gone.&#xD;
"That was right; and while we are waiting, dome the&#xD;
kindness to have the trunks put on the wagon."&#xD;
"With pleasure;" and he went eagerly to attend to the&#xD;
request.&#xD;
Then the train moved on, the few idlers who almost&#xD;
gazed their eyes out at Gertrude dispersed, and entering&#xD;
the carriage, our quartette drove slowly through the&#xD;
deepening twilight to "Pleasant Retreat."&#xD;
"You have not changed much, Margaret, although&#xD;
your hair is a little gray," said her brother.&#xD;
"I wish I could say the same of you, Reuben; but you&#xD;
are sadly altered. Is your health bad?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes. I'm ~ mere wreck."&#xD;
"Wbat's the matter?"&#xD;
"hard work and no rest; for you must. have some idea&#xD;
of the up-hill road I've had to travel all these long years."&#xD;
"Yes. You certainly have achieved wonders."&#xD;
"No, not wonders, but the possibility that lies within&#xD;
ithe reach of every American boy who has ability and&#xD;
perseverance.&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
Here the conversation stopped,, and Paul was heard&#xD;
saying;&#xD;
"Do you think you will like the country, Miss Law-&#xD;
rence?"&#xD;
"Oh, I don't know; I've never thought of it at all;"&#xD;
and as her words called forth no response, the remainder&#xD;
of the distance was accomplished in silence, each one&#xD;
being busy wth their 6wn thoughts.&#xD;
As was the custom in those days, there were numerous&#xD;
stands erected in the park, upon which were enkindled&#xD;
nightly fires,~not so~ much for the purpose of illumination&#xD;
as for the object of enticing the bugs and insects which&#xD;
otherwise rendered it exceedingly disagreeable to re-&#xD;
main indoors.&#xD;
"flow familiar!" said Mrs. Lawrence, as the light&#xD;
broke upon her, for the custom had been one which her&#xD;
father observed, and memory was again busy with her&#xD;
childhood.&#xD;
"Here's marster-.here's master" cried a bevy of&#xD;
voices; and about forty little black urchins, more or less,,&#xD;
ran in advance of the carriage to open~ the gate which&#xD;
led into the park. "How d'ye, master? how d'ye, mars-&#xD;
ter?" they then shouted, and as he smiled and said:&#xD;
"Oh, you little scamps 1" they danceL1for joy at the&#xD;
recognition, and showed the whites of their teeth and&#xD;
eyes more than the law allows.&#xD;
"That must be a very heavy gate," suggested. Ger-&#xD;
trude with a smile, and trying to count the number of~&#xD;
children who held it open.&#xD;
"Not half so heavy as their hearts would be were theyr.&#xD;
denied the privilege of opening and closing it," answered&#xD;
her uncle, with a gratified look&amp;amp;&#xD;

THE ~RW~&amp;amp;t.                  87&#xD;
&#xD;
Bat now they were at the house, and upon alighting&#xD;
were surrounded by a fresh bevy of Afric's sons and&#xD;
daughters, who took bodily possession of them, wliil~ pet&#xD;
dogs in abundance barked forth their noisy welcome,&#xD;
"Rio," the special favorite of the master, leading off in&#xD;
the demonstration; for, to tell the truth, "Rio" had al-&#xD;
most as much sense as anybody, and he knew full well&#xD;
that something unusual was going on.&#xD;
"Get away, 'Rio,' and you 'Troup,' you 'Frank,' you&#xD;
'Bink~,' begone," said the master, stamping his foot at&#xD;
his pets; but as this only increased ,their barking, he&#xD;
was compelled at last to call in the aid of "I-Tarry," the&#xD;
"Major Domo," as he called, his colored valet and car-&#xD;
riage-driver, to get rid of them. This noise being finally&#xD;
'~silenced, he said to his sister and Gertrude:&#xD;
"Welcome to 'Pleasant Retreat;' and here, 'Ellen,'&#xD;
take these band-boxes~ and you, 'Dora,' take these shawls,&#xD;
and 'Fanny,' take this basket."&#xD;
"'yes, sab," they answered, curtseying, and seizing the&#xD;
respective charges.&#xD;
" his is Miss Margaret, and this is Miss Gertrude,"&#xD;
lie said by way of introduction, and after much "how~.&#xD;
d'ye-doing "'on the part of the ladies, and "J'se well"&#xD;
on the part of the darkiess," they ascended the half&#xD;
dozen steps, and stood on the porch, where they were&#xD;
greeted by '~ Aunt Eliza Jane," the faithful old house-&#xD;
keeper and cook, who had for twenty years or more su-&#xD;
perintended the household affairs of the "Retreat."&#xD;
"Is supper ready, 'Eliza'?" asked the master.&#xD;
"Yes, sah; ready and waiting. "&#xD;
"Then ~show these ladies to their room, 'Ellen~' and&#xD;
when they get the dust off,: we'll have supper;" and&#xD;
&#xD;
"2Ellen~" and "Dora" and "Fanny" mounted the an-&#xD;
tique stair-way, followed by the ladies, when, to make&#xD;
sure that everything was right, "Aunt 'Liza" left her&#xD;
particular domain and went after the guests and her&#xD;
children, for these girls were all the offspring of "Harry"&#xD;
and herself, and well they might have been called the&#xD;
happy family.&#xD;
"Got all you wants, Miss Margaret?" she asked.&#xD;
"I believe so, thank you, 'Eliza.'"&#xD;
"Ladies 'are a rarity here, are they not, 'Aunt 'Liza'?"&#xD;
asked Gertrude.&#xD;
"Lor, chile, no-why, master has big parties and&#xD;
balls here sometimes, and de ladies frum de whole neigh-&#xD;
berrin' country 'round here comes to 'em."&#xD;
"Why, you don't tell me?" said Gertrude, with 'a&#xD;
smile. "Why, I thought uncle was a cross, crabbed old&#xD;
bachelor that a lady never would speak to."&#xD;
"Marster ain't nuffin ob de kind: he's jes as peaceable-&#xD;
like' and good as he can be, haint he, 'Dora'?" and it&#xD;
was quite evident that the "~iarster" couldn't be spoken&#xD;
of so lightly in. that presence.&#xD;
"'Deed he is," answered '~ Dora;" then added, "and&#xD;
we all lubs master, kase he's good to us."&#xD;
"Jes as good as de days is long," said "Aunt 'Liza,"&#xD;
turning down the cover from the snowy bed. "But I&#xD;
must be goin', and.jes make yeselfs entirely at home, and&#xD;
if ye wants anything, jes call one ob de gals; and soon&#xD;
as ye gits ready, come right down, for supper is waiting. "&#xD;
"Well, we are ready, now," said Gertrude; and to-&#xD;
gether they descended to the parlor, where Mr. Hall and&#xD;
j Paul awaited them.&#xD;
"So you've finished beautifying yourself, have you?"&#xD;

asked thee uncle, looking at his lovely niece again, for in&#xD;
his heart her beauty pleased him.&#xD;
"Oh yes, that didn't take long, uncle," was the smiling&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"Well, I declare, Gertrude," said the mother, "be-&#xD;
tween Reuben. and yourself, I really fear you will be.&#xD;
ruined;" for somehow~ or other she entertained the&#xD;
ridiculous idea that she could keep her daughter from&#xD;
knowing that she was pretty, when, too, that daughter&#xD;
could look into her mirror every hour in the day.&#xD;
"Supper's ready, masterr" "Ellen" stood in the door-&#xD;
Way and said, from behind her waiter.&#xD;
Arising, Mr. Hall, said:&#xD;
"Come, Margaret, and Paul, bring the girl into sup-&#xD;
per;" but slipping her hand through his arm, Gertrude&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"The girl 'prefers to bring her uncle into supper, and&#xD;
Mr. Maxwell can bring the widow if he chooses."&#xD;
"Anything to please the children," said Mr. Hall,&#xD;
laughing: and they all entered the dining-room in a glee&#xD;
that was truly refreshing, followed by the dogs before&#xD;
mentioned, for "Rio" was literally his master's shadow,&#xD;
and always expected to eat at 'the same time the "white&#xD;
folks" did, as the negroes say. The blessing over, Ger-&#xD;
trade said:&#xD;
"Well, uncle, I declare! do you expect me to eat with&#xD;
all thes0 dogs around here?" as the quartette grouped&#xD;
themselves around the ux~aster's chair.&#xD;
"I certainly do, for I wouldn't have anything, unless&#xD;
I could share it with 'Rio '-would I, 'Rio'?" and the&#xD;
faithful "Rio" whined and barked as if, he understood&#xD;
what his master was saying.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"But I haven't made you acquainted with this impor-~&#xD;
taut branch of my family yet-have I?"&#xD;
Well, then, first and foremost, this is 'Rio Janeiro,'&#xD;
-shake hands with' Miss Gertrude,' 'Rio;"' and putting&#xD;
up his right forefoot, he did as ~he was bid-"he was a&#xD;

from South America; and this mastiff is named 'Frank-.&#xD;

"For 'Sir Bingo,' in 'St. Ronan's Well'?"&#xD;
"The same-we call him 'Binks' for short; and this&#xD;
poor old blind cur is named 'George liVE. ~&#xD;
"Troup," exclaimed Gertrude, almost springing from&#xD;
her chair; then looking at her mother without intending&#xD;
to dp it, she sighed and sank back, and looked at the poor&#xD;
old blind dog with something like pity and interest in her&#xD;
moistened eyes.&#xD;
"Yes, Troup; there's nothing so strange in that, i~&#xD;
there? He's named for the great Georgian-the, wis.e&#xD;
statesman, the intrepid governor."&#xD;
"Yes, I know, I know," said Gertrude impatiently.&#xD;
"We call him 'Troup,' for short ;"' and seeing instantly,&#xD;
with his usual in~ight,'that there was something singular&#xD;
in Gertrude'B conduct, he looked at her closely, to divine,&#xD;
if possible, what it was. Appreciating the situation, and&#xD;
thinking it best to change 'the subject, Mrs. Lawrence ~aid~;&#xD;
"Why, what an excellent cook you have, IReuben! The&#xD;
coffee is delicious, and the 'waffles as nice as I ever tasted."&#xD;
"Yes, "Liza' usually manages to do very well, eon~ider- -&#xD;
ing there's no woman to overlook things;" and a bark'from&#xD;
"Rio" was repaid with a. biscuit.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Why is it that you have never married, uncle?" asked&#xD;
Gertrude, with that respectful familiarity which his un-&#xD;
assuming manners invited.&#xD;
"Perhaps it's because I couldn't," he said smiling, fob&#xD;
lowed by something like a sigh.&#xD;
"Oh, uncle, that will never do. What, the lIon. Reu-&#xD;
ben Hall, United States Senator, couldn't get married!&#xD;
Why, there are plenty of women would jump at the chance,&#xD;
and do half the courting."&#xD;
"Do I not speak the truth, Margaret?"&#xD;
"Indeed I~ can't say, Reuben, for you know I haven't&#xD;
kept up with you all these long years."&#xD;
"There now, you can get no proof there, for mother&#xD;
sticks to the truth in the most persistent and provoking&#xD;
way.&#xD;
"A virtue you do not seem to have the highest regard&#xD;
for," suggested Paul.&#xD;
"'Well, no, too much. of it is sometimes disagree .&#xD;
able."&#xD;
"You naughty child," said Mr. Hall, joining in the&#xD;
general laugh.&#xD;
"Come now, uncle, own up like a man, and tell me why&#xD;
I haven't an aunt here to greet me, instead of an old&#xD;
bachelor with a lot of dogs."&#xD;
'ILhope you don't dislike my dogs, Gertrude, for who-&#xD;
ever likes me, must like my dogs; and besides, they are&#xD;
all I have got to love."&#xD;
"That's just what I am driving at. I want to know&#xD;
why you haven't something else to love."&#xD;
"Well, then, since you are so persistent and will know,&#xD;
I'll tell you what I told a lady in North Carolina once,&#xD;
and that is) that the ladies whom I had desired to marry I&#xD;
&#xD;
~had4oo much respect to address, and those whom I could&#xD;
marry, I had too much regard for myself to court."&#xD;
"For shame," cried Gertrude, as a general laugh fol-&#xD;
lowed these words, "and I don't intend to allow you to&#xD;
talk about my uncle in that way;" and as "Troup" then&#xD;
gave a bark, she silenced him with a piece of chicken.&#xD;
"Does the poor dog want some supper?" then asked&#xD;
the master of the old blind pet. '~ Speak for it, then;&#xD;
ci~y for it-louder;" and as he almost talked, Mr. hail&#xD;
said,~" Give him his supper, "Fanny.'" Then turning to&#xD;
Gertrude, he said: "IL told you the truth, child."&#xD;
"I don't believe a word of it; and besides, it may not&#xD;
be too late yet, for 'Aunt 'Liza' and 'Ellen' have been&#xD;
telling me that you have balls and parties here every now&#xD;
and then."&#xD;
"Certainly we do, but I'm past the marrying time&#xD;
now;" and as a genuine sigh followed these words, we&#xD;
thought, who knows, perhaps he has loved and ha~ been&#xD;
disappointed, like so many others.&#xD;
"You should not be so inquisitive, my daughter,~~ sug.&#xD;
tested the mother.&#xD;
"Never mind, mother, uncle and IL wrn understand&#xD;
each other, will we not?"&#xD;
"Oh yes; let her alone, Margaret, and let her do what~&#xD;
ever will make her happy;" and with these words they all&#xD;
arose and followed the master int&amp;amp; the study, where the&#xD;
dust and confusion proved conclusively the need of a&#xD;
woman al)out the establishment.&#xD;
"happy?" said Gertrude, just loud enough for her&#xD;
uncle to hear her, as she clung to his arm ;.then, with a&#xD;
sigh, she recrossed the hail silently, and mounted the&#xD;
stairs to her room.&#xD;

"Leave her alone, and time will do the rest," he an-&#xD;
swered, while a 109k of concern knitted his brows and&#xD;
compressed his lips. And while they sat talking of the&#xD;
past, the night waned, and Gertrude sank into a stupor&#xD;
of misery which rendered her alike unconscious of time&#xD;
and place.&#xD;
She had tried so hard to be gay, because her mother&#xD;
requested it, and because she thought she owed it to her&#xD;
uncle; but her spirit and strength had been taxed beyond&#xD;
their powers, the tension was too tight, and the heart-&#xD;
cords snapped when her uncle talked to her of being&#xD;
happy.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
HOMESICK.&#xD;
ETURNING home late one evening, Clifford&#xD;
was rather surprised not to find Virginia upon&#xD;
the gallery to meet him, for this was her custom.&#xD;
Bowing to his uncle and aunt, with whom he made his&#xD;
home, he said to the latter:&#xD;
"Where is my wife?"&#xD;
"She has not come down yet," was the reply, which&#xD;
sent him upstairs with a well-defined apprehension at '~&#xD;
heart that all was not right.&#xD;
Conscieiice does not only make cowards of us, but it is.&#xD;
the unerring monitor that reminds us of neglected duties;&#xD;
and Clifford felt, in the self-examination then forced upon&#xD;
him, that he had not been all to his young wife that he&#xD;
might have been.&#xD;
He forgot that she was a stranger among strangers-.&#xD;
that she was a mere child, who was separated from her&#xD;
parents for the first time, and selfishly thought only of.&#xD;
himself, while she was left alone ~to wonder at his con-&#xD;
tinual absence.&#xD;
A species of refined cruelty which is unjust to the&#xD;
wife, and unpardonable in the husband.&#xD;
The days of early married life are trying anyhow, but&#xD;
if he who has taken the fluttering bird from the parent&#xD;
nest would only shelter her with those thoughtful little&#xD;
attentions which should be hers in consideration of all&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ARRIVAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8257-00000047"/>&#xD;
she has given up for him, there would be no necessity for&#xD;
recording secret tears and pangs concealed.&#xD;
'Many men neglect these minor things through thought-&#xD;
lessness, while their hearts are full of love, and we trust&#xD;
it is only necessary to show them the importance of what&#xD;
they consider trifles, for them to be put into immediate&#xD;
execution. So let them always bear in mind, that they&#xD;
are the thousand and one little nameless attentions which&#xD;
love suggests, that will make their wives devoted and&#xD;
happy, themselves satisfied and contented, and home&#xD;
the dearest spot of earth.&#xD;
It was deep twilight when Clifford entered the room,&#xD;
but by the soft moonlight which came in at the windows,&#xD;
he saw his wife lying upon a lounge. She did not turn&#xD;
to greet him though, but remained motionless with her&#xD;
face to the wall, until he knelt beside her and said:&#xD;
"Virginia!"&#xD;
Only her name * no "darling," no "dearest," no&#xD;
"sweet one," none of those little titles of affection which&#xD;
signify nothing in themselves, but which mean so much&#xD;
when they come from a loving heart. No; by none of&#xD;
these did her husband ever greet her, and already. her&#xD;
woman's nature yearned for perhaps what it would never&#xD;
have.&#xD;
Clifford was a poor dissembler~ and he was too full of&#xD;
the old love to be yet on with the new-a sufficient cause&#xD;
to raise up awall between himself and his wife, and ad-&#xD;
ditional proof that where marriage is not based upon&#xD;
perfect harmQny, that no man can properly do his&#xD;
duty.&#xD;
However, a gentle nature and a chivalry peculiar to&#xD;
our people, made him the friend of every woman, and his&#xD;
&#xD;
.H OM E ICR.&#xD;
&#xD;
H0MJ~5I0K.                95&#xD;
heart was touched as he pressed his wife's hand and said&#xD;
tenderly:&#xD;
"Virginia, are you sick?"&#xD;
"No," came from quivering lips.&#xD;
"What is the matter, then?" kindly and anxiously&#xD;
again asked her husband.&#xD;
"Nothing much," said the young wife in a tone which&#xD;
implied a good deal.&#xD;
"Nothing much! then you admit there is something?&#xD;
What is it? tell me-don't'keep anything from me."&#xD;
As if forced from her, she said:&#xD;
"I'm only homesick!" and her tears told the rest.&#xD;
"Only homesick!" As if that didn't mean overy~&#xD;
thing!&#xD;
Why, it meant to be neglected by one who should&#xD;
have made the absence of dear ones a temporary oblivion&#xD;
-to be left to herself in the midst ofg strangers-to be&#xD;
made to feel that she was nothing to him for whom she&#xD;
had given up family, home, luxury, and love without&#xD;
measure. "Only homesick!" A heart-pang that might&#xD;
be spared by a little care and tenderness; and no man has&#xD;
any right to take a woman from a home where she is the&#xD;
centre of devotion, without he expects to give her at&#xD;
least what she has relinquished for him, if not more.~&#xD;
Feeling this for the first time, Clifford took his wife in&#xD;
his arms and said tenderly:&#xD;
"Then you shall go home, Virginia."&#xD;
"Not without you, Clifford;" and the whole story&#xD;
was told as she put both arms aroun~1 his neck, and&#xD;
nestled her head in his bosom. She was homesick for&#xD;
hbn.-she wanted more of his society; and when he dis.&#xD;
covered how dearly she loved him, he hated himself for&#xD;

&#xD;
allowing any. force pf circumstances to make him deceive&#xD;
such a trusting and confiding child. Other men have&#xD;
experienced this feeling before; and so surely as night&#xD;
follows the day, will nature recoil upon the heads of&#xD;
those who disregard and outrage iher holiest claims.&#xD;
There was silence between them for some moments,&#xD;
and the low sobs of his young wife smote Clifford's heart&#xD;
painfully. Then he said:&#xD;
'~ But I cannot leave just now, Virginia, for court is in&#xD;
-session, and my cases may be called any day."&#xD;
"Then P11 stay with you;" and her wifely devotion&#xD;
made itself known in these few words: "But, Clifford, I&#xD;
see so little of you, and I'm so lonely when you are&#xD;
gone."&#xD;
- "Isn't my aunt company for you?"&#xD;
"Oh, but you. know ~he has her house 'aud children to&#xD;
look after, and always when I go down she seems so busy&#xD;
that, for fear of intrusion, I soon return to my own room.&#xD;
Then I am so lonely that I can't help crying."&#xD;
"But now you mustn't cry any more, foi' it will make&#xD;
me very unhappy if you do;" and he wiped the tears&#xD;
from her eyes.&#xD;
"Then I will try not," said the loving little unappre~&#xD;
cited wife, "for I wouldn't make you unhappy for the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"Nor I you, my little wife. But come, will you not&#xD;
get ready for tea ?" and he raised her from the lounge.&#xD;
"Not this evening, for I fear my eyes are too red. Be-&#xD;
sides, Clifford, it is sc~ sweet to be all alone with you. I&#xD;
don't-want to see any one but just you."&#xD;
And if he had 'felt as she did, how happy they might&#xD;
have been! But instead of his heart responding to hers,&#xD;
&#xD;
IIONtESIOK.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
hOMESIcK.&#xD;
an uncomfortable twinge made itself felt in that organ,&#xD;
and he said with truth and earnestness:&#xD;
"Virginia, you love me more than I deserve."&#xD;
here the conversation was interrupted by a rap at the&#xD;
door, announcing supper.&#xD;
Turning to go, Clifford said:&#xD;
"Shall I seni you a cup of tea?"&#xD;
"Just bring it when you come."&#xD;
"Nothing else?"&#xD;
"No, thank you;" and with a breath of relief, he&#xD;
closed the door bet~veen himself and his wife-with a&#xD;
breath of relief he left the presence of her whouf he had&#xD;
sworn to love, to keep, and to cherish. Do not be&#xD;
shocked, fo~' Clifford is not the first man who ever felt&#xD;
this way, nor will he be the last, so long as men shall&#xD;
marry for money and convenience; for where there is&#xD;
not -love, there can be nothing but aversion.&#xD;
lie ~~as very miserable ; for no man can deliberately&#xD;
sacrifice the happiness of another without suffering, no&#xD;
matter how hardened both his heart and his conscience&#xD;
may be.&#xD;
"Where's Virginia?" asked Mrs. Baker, when Clifford&#xD;
entered the dining-room alone.&#xD;
"She's not feeling very well this evening, and doesn't&#xD;
wish any tea."&#xD;
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. I thought she was only a little&#xD;
late dressing, or I should ha4e gone in to have seen her.'~&#xD;
"Oh, she's not sick, only feeling a little homesick, I&#xD;
fancy."&#xD;
"An inevitable disease for brides, but a most distress~.&#xD;
ing one, as I have cause to know," said Mrs. Baker, with&#xD;
feeling. "I must see her and try to cheer her up."&#xD;

&#xD;
But Clifford made no repl~r, for he stood at the side-&#xD;
board pouring out some whiskey from a decanter, while&#xD;
his uncle looked on with a frown of disapproval, for he&#xD;
knew that this habit of drinking was growing upon his&#xD;
nephew, and it gave him great concern, lie would speak&#xD;
to him about it. Whei'efore? lie knew by experience if&#xD;
men were determined to drink, that they would do it,&#xD;
but he resolved at any rate to enter a protest before it&#xD;
should be too late; for he believed, and we believe, that&#xD;
it is our duty to remonstrate one with another, when we&#xD;
see our friends being dragged down to ruin by some vile&#xD;
habit, which is not, only tolerated, but winked at by so-&#xD;
ciety. If women only half appreciated their po~Ter, and&#xD;
the danger which threatens the men of our la3id from&#xD;
this increasing love of liquor, what an immense influence&#xD;
they might wield for good in the world. For suppose,&#xD;
instead of drinking with men, they should say: ~' Don't&#xD;
drink that. I especially request you not to," what man&#xD;
would refuse? It's all very well for persons who regard&#xD;
this thing too lightly to say:&#xD;
"Men are going to drink anyhow ;" but what encourage-&#xD;
inent haye they ever had to abandon this pernicious and&#xD;
insidious practice? If they don't drinksvwhy, they are to&#xD;
be taunted with, "oh, he's a temperance man,"' " lie's&#xD;
afraid &amp;amp;f his mother," "lie's afraid of his wife." Would&#xD;
to Heaven they were all three, for then there would be no&#xD;
wretched mothers over. sons gone astray-no heart-bro-&#xD;
- ken wives over husbands who were victims to this fleixd-&#xD;
jaW habit. 'Who doubts but that a substantial reform&#xD;
would take place, if every woman in the land would turn&#xD;
her face against this curse, which is born of the devil, and&#xD;
which is his ~surest and; largest plan of destruction? Irave&#xD;
&#xD;
you a father, a husband, a brother who driuks3 flave&#xD;
you a son in whom all your hopes are centered, who per-&#xD;
chance may be lured into taking his first glass of 'wine,&#xD;
when temptingly held out to him by tl~e hand of beauty?&#xD;
Think of it, oh mothers, wives, and sisters, and pause, be-&#xD;
fore encouragiu~ such a deadly snai~e for the betrayal, if&#xD;
not ruin, of those you love. Banish wines from your par-&#xD;
tie~, from your dinner-tables, from your receptions, and let&#xD;
your friends understand that you would as soon give them&#xD;
the Borgia poison as have them drink; for while one&#xD;
kills outright, the other blasts the moral nature, and&#xD;
makes that life a curse which might'otherwise have been&#xD;
a comfort to one's family, a bies~ing to one's country, and&#xD;
a glory to God.&#xD;
But while we've been entering this little wedge against&#xD;
a custom which is the great and prevalent evil ~-of our&#xD;
land, supper was oyer, and Clifford had returned with the&#xD;
cup of tea for his gentle, blue-eyed wife. As usual, the'&#xD;
room was bright and~ cosey, his slippery and robe were&#xD;
ready for him, and putting them on, he sat down to.- a&#xD;
book, and Virginia laid upon the lounge and watched&#xD;
him. her tears had ceased' to flow, but her heart felt&#xD;
heavy, and the pOOr child was still-homesick.&#xD;

T was decided that G&amp;amp;rtrude should remain at&#xD;
"Pleasant Retreat;" so, after a visit of a week,&#xD;
Mrs. Lawrence returned to her home, which was&#xD;
desolate enough without her only child.&#xD;
Gertrude, I feai you are not ~vell," said her uncle&#xD;
one morning, after she had been with him some weeks~&#xD;
"Yes, uncle, I am very well ;" and confusion brought&#xD;
the roses once more~ to her cheeks4&#xD;
"You have grown perceptibly paler and thinner since&#xD;
your arrival here ;" and as he fixed his penetrating eyes&#xD;
apon her, she felt as if he was looking into her very&#xD;
heart, and reading the secrets which she held as sacred.&#xD;
"What is the matter with you?"&#xD;
"Nothing," was the trite reply; but the moistened eyes&#xD;
which sought the floor to hide their tears, told a different&#xD;
story; and Mr. Hall knew to the contrary as he leant&#xD;
forward and whispered in her ear:&#xD;
"You are struggling with a great love!" at which&#xD;
words she start~l, like some guilty creature caught in the&#xD;
act which he fain would hide from every human eye.&#xD;
"You are a brave gid, and you are trying to do t1ie&#xD;
best you can, but I think I can~.h~lp you.~,&#xD;
The poor child, who as y~V 'did not understand that&#xD;
there was anything else to do except to indulge the nat-&#xD;
ural impulses of the heart without restraint, sat weeping,&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
IN TJ3EE " SANCTUARY"         101&#xD;
&#xD;
and her good, kind uncle was touched as much as he&#xD;
could be, considering he h~d had no love-episodes, and&#xD;
that he had put all of' the softer feelings out of his life,&#xD;
as being too effeminate, and requiring too much time.&#xD;
After regarding her silently for son~e time, he proceeded&#xD;
by asking:&#xD;
"Do you think it right for you to indulge this love&#xD;
now?"&#xD;
"No," was the scarcely audible reply&#xD;
"Do you think it right to still cherish the memrn~of&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"&#xD;
"Then why~do you do it?"&#xD;
"I cannot help it!" came in all honesty and sincerity&#xD;
from a heart that loved with a depth whi~h is known to&#xD;
but few, for to every one is not given the knowledge of&#xD;
how to love.&#xD;
"have you tried to help it? "asked the statesman, who&#xD;
like the skilful surgeon probed deeply ,and mercilessly in&#xD;
order to cure this terrible malady.&#xD;
"I have," was the faltering reply, for she felt doubtful&#xD;
as to whether her efforts had been altogether honest' or&#xD;
not.&#xD;
"How have you tried?" and as her uncle l~aiit for-&#xD;
ward and scrutinized her face closely, she felt that it was&#xD;
utterly useless to attempt~ any longer either to deceive&#xD;
herself or him; Lut she saId nothing. 11cr silence con-&#xD;
:tirmed what he feared, and with an ominous shake of the&#xD;
head, he said;&#xD;
"Alit my child, you, like too many others, attempt to&#xD;
deceive yourself. You say you have tried to keep from&#xD;
indulging a feeling, which you not only know,,but con.&#xD;

&#xD;
fess is wrong. But how have you tried? I will tell you.&#xD;
You have tried, by thinking of nothing else, day and&#xD;
night, and by keeping constantly before you the image&#xD;
of one whoi~n it is now crinie for you to cherish. 'You&#xD;
fancy yourself badly treated by man, and, your heart is&#xD;
fast being hardened towards God for permitting what you&#xD;
consider great injustice to yourself. Is it not so? All&#xD;
this my child, is wrong and wicked, and is not only&#xD;
injuring your own health, but is killing your mother."&#xD;
"Killing my mother!" exclaimed Gertrude, as she&#xD;
recalled the worn and haggard expression of that dear&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Yes; wearing her away, day by day, for the melan-&#xD;
choly change which has come upon you affects her more&#xD;
than you can understand. You are all she has to live&#xD;
for, and do you suppose she can feel happy when you&#xD;
are unhappy?"&#xD;
"I did not know this-I never thought of it," said&#xD;
Gertrude, 'as if talking to herself. "I didn't know any&#xD;
one cared for wha.t I felt."&#xD;
"We all care, my child'; and you owe it .to us, no less&#xD;
than to yourself, to get rid of this enemy which is prey-&#xD;
ing in secret upon you, and if possible, to make us happy&#xD;
by your smiles."&#xD;
"Uncle, I do not feel as if I should ever smile again,&#xD;
for life is over with me, and I shall never be happy any&#xD;
more!" and the tears would come.&#xD;
"Life over at seventeen!" said the uncle in surprise.&#xD;
"Why, you are only a baby! and besides, those persons&#xD;
who. smile are not always happy; but those alone are&#xD;
happy who know their duty and do it."&#xD;
Seeing that he was making an impression, he continued:&#xD;
&#xD;
IN THJ~ "sANcTUAg~."&#xD;
&#xD;
103&#xD;
&#xD;
"And even if we are miserable ourselves, it is sheer&#xD;
selfishness to inflict that misery upon others. How much&#xD;
better, how much~nobler it would be, did we crus self,&#xD;
and' live for those who are dependent upon our s iles for&#xD;
their happiness! Did you ever think of this,&#xD;
Drying her eyes, and looking thoughtfully out of the&#xD;
open window by which she sat, she said after awhile:&#xD;
"I must confess I never. I did not know it mattered&#xD;
what I felt; nor did I dream that it affected any one&#xD;
else."&#xD;
Her answer did not surprise him, for he knew human&#xD;
nature too well.&#xD;
"But you will think of it i~ow, Gertrude?" and so&#xD;
deep an impression had be made 'upon her in this short&#xD;
conversation, that she said at once with an earnestness&#xD;
that was unmistakable:&#xD;
"Yes, uncle; and if you will tell me what my duty is,&#xD;
I will try and do it."&#xD;
"That's a brave girl," lie said, while the joy that beat&#xD;
in his heart shone forth in his beaming eyes. Then,&#xD;
with great seriousness, he said:&#xD;
"But you ~anuot do this of yourself." Evidently not&#xD;
understanding his meaning, she said:&#xD;
"Cannot do it of myself?"&#xD;
"No, not without the help of God. Do you never&#xD;
pray ? "&#xD;
"Not now," came with a sigh and downcast eyes.&#xD;
"Butyouusedto?"&#xD;
"Your mother taught yo~i this?"&#xD;
"Then why do you neglect it now?"&#xD;

"Because, uncle, I have been so unhappy!" and the&#xD;
fountain, which seemed inexhaustible, sent~ forth fresh&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
'~ So much more the reason why you should ask for&#xD;
help to carry your cross; for does not Christ say, 'Come&#xD;
unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will&#xD;
give'you rest?' Come;child, come with me, and together&#xD;
~we will kneel down and ask help from above;" and&#xD;
taking her by the hand, they walked across the room and&#xD;
stood before a door which ~was never opened except by&#xD;
the, master of "Pleasant Retreat." Taking a key from&#xD;
his pocket, he unlocked the door, and they entered a&#xD;
small room, the furniture of which consisted of a table,&#xD;
with an open Bible upon it, and one chair. Gertrude at&#xD;
once understood that it was an eccentricity .of her uncle&#xD;
to set this room apart for sacred purposes; and while she&#xD;
stood in wondering silence at the beautiful idea, he said:&#xD;
"This is my 'Sanctuary'; and it is here that I come to&#xD;
ask God to help me in the struggles of my life~ J2et us&#xD;
pray; "' and kneeling down, his voic6 ascended in an elo-&#xD;
quent petition in behalf of the unhappy girl who knelt&#xD;
weeping by his side. Up-up-higher-higher went the&#xD;
prayer to that everlasting throne of mercy, and unto him&#xD;
who is always merciful to those who ask for it-.-always&#xD;
forgiving to those x~ho wish to b~ forgiven-always lov-&#xD;
ing to those who desire to be loved. And who knows&#xD;
but that this great and 'good man had loved and lost, too,&#xD;
as wo!l as the unhappy girl for whom he prayed. That&#xD;
4here was some mystery in his life, was admitted; but&#xD;
what., it was, was another thing. had he an idol some-&#xD;
where in the world? Perhaps!&#xD;

F only that house were out of the way! But so&#xD;
long as it stands there, it will be. a daily torture&#xD;
for me to pass it!"&#xD;
Thus thought the husband of scarce two months, as his&#xD;
eyes fell upon the unoffending cottage of the widow,&#xD;
which stood almost opposite his uncle's.&#xD;
This may not seem very proper or very manly in. Clif-&#xD;
ford, but it was what was suggested to him ~dmost every&#xD;
day, as he passed and repassed the4ittle cottage, beneath&#xD;
whose roof 'had been spent the happiest as well as the&#xD;
most wretched hours of his life.&#xD;
And shall we not be merciful? We who perchance&#xD;
have our cottage wherein the' hours flew unheeded-&#xD;
wherein we told our love-~--.wherein we d m'eamt bright ~&#xD;
dreams, 'and talked of those far-off joys. which we fancied&#xD;
would be ours?&#xD;
Shall we not be merciful to those who cherish a rose~&#xD;
bud-a geranium leaf-a half-worn letter all blotted&#xD;
with tears-a ring which eats into the flesh with its har-&#xD;
rowing memories, but without which they would be still&#xD;
more wretched-a tress of hair-a book all interlined-&#xD;
for have not 'we the same?&#xD;
Have we not all walked upon forbidden ground? have&#xD;
we not all our forbidden memories?&#xD;
Yes, a thousand times yes.! Then lets us pity and be&#xD;

charitable; but do not let us become converts to the per.&#xD;
nicious doctrine of "it might b~ve been;" for this it&#xD;
was which was crushing Clifford beneath its baneful in-&#xD;
fluence. Rather let us inscribe upon our banner "it may&#xD;
be," and pressing boldly forward, Inake the future what&#xD;
it should be, with the errors of the past omitted.&#xD;
But by day and by night these forbidden memories&#xD;
held Clifford in bondage, ca using him to neglect his du-&#xD;
ties, to ignore his young wife, and to seek temporary ob~~&#xD;
livion in artificial means.&#xD;
It was not rightbut it was what they drove him to do;&#xD;
and man that he was, he did not seem strong enough to&#xD;
resist their thraldom.&#xD;

ALP-PAST six!" said Gertrude, as she and Paul&#xD;
Maxwell stopped at a creek to water their horses,&#xD;
upon their return from a morning ride. "Then&#xD;
we must hurry, or IL will be too late for uncle's breakfast."&#xD;
"There's plenty of time. It's only about two miles&#xD;
from here," said Paul, bestowing unmistakable glances of&#xD;
admiration upon his beautiful companion.&#xD;
But they were all lost upon Gertrude, as she sat grace-i&#xD;
fully stroking the mane of "Lucy," the pet of her uncle's&#xD;
stables, for the past was as yet too vivid for her to think&#xD;
of indulging in the female luxury of adding another vic~&#xD;
tory to her list of conquests. No, she was a true and an&#xD;
earnest woman. She had perhaps as few frivolities as&#xD;
belong to her sex, an when her heart was enlisted in a&#xD;
cause it was almos a life-struggle to abandon it. She&#xD;
had promised her uncle she would try and forget what&#xD;
was now crime to remember, and With all the earnestness&#xD;
of her nature, aided by his encouraging smiles, and their&#xD;
united prayers, she was gradually overcoming what was&#xD;
conquering him from whom she was separated. But the&#xD;
horses were through drinking, and gathering the reins&#xD;
more tightly, and arranging her skirt with an easy grace,&#xD;
Gertrude looked at Paul and said:&#xD;
"Now for a race;" and away she flew along the shady&#xD;
road that was flecked here and there with sunbeams,&#xD;

while Paul was close behind her, and at length they were&#xD;
head to head. Tqo ambitious to allow this, Gertrude&#xD;
urged '1' Lucy" to a quicker speed, and passing within&#xD;
the open gateway, outdistanced her escort by at least a&#xD;
hundred yards, much to- the delight of her uncle, who&#xD;
stood upon the porch watching them.&#xD;
"Good! fine!" cried Mr. hall; and before Paul could&#xD;
dismount, Gertrude sprang to the ground, and running up&#xD;
the steps gave her uncle a good-morning kiss.&#xD;
"So you. have concluded to try an old man's prescrip.&#xD;
tjon?~&#xD;
"Yes, uncle, and I feel so much better," she answered,&#xD;
while the delicate tinge upon her cheek n~ade her look as&#xD;
tempting as a ripe peach.&#xD;
"Ali! PauV that was an inglorious defeat," said Mr.&#xD;
Hall, as the young r~ian joined them on the porch.&#xD;
"But you wouldn't have me be so ungallant, sir, as to&#xD;
beat a lady?"&#xD;
"No, indeed, nor would I have the fox eat grapes if he&#xD;
couldn't reach them," said Mr. hall laughingly.&#xD;
"Breakfast is ready, sir," said Ellen appearing in the&#xD;
doorway, looking, black and fresh as ever, and dropping&#xD;
the inevitable courtesy.&#xD;
"Come, children, some into breakfast;" and Mr. Hall.&#xD;
led the way.&#xD;
"Thank you, sir;* I will not come in this morning, but&#xD;
will ride down for the mail;" and bowing gracefully,&#xD;
Paul left them.&#xD;
When seated at the table, Mr. Hall said:&#xD;
"What do you think of Paul, Gertrude?"&#xD;
"Well, really, uncle, I have never thought of him at&#xD;
all," was the indifferent reply.'&#xD;
&#xD;
~~ANGELS AND MINiSTERS OF GIAOE," x~rc.       109&#xD;
&#xD;
"Never thought of him at all!" and the statesman ele-&#xD;
vated his eyebrows in surprise.&#xD;
"Come, come, child, that will not do! The ides of a&#xD;
beautiful young woman being thrown in daily contact&#xD;
with a handsome young man for nearly twos mouths and&#xD;
then to say she has never given him a thought, is alto-&#xD;
gether past my comprehension."&#xD;
"And that is altogether attributable to the superior&#xD;
vanity of your sex, uncle."&#xD;
"You mean the vanity of the superior sex," he smiled&#xD;
~tnd said: "But you do not think Paul handsome?"&#xD;
"Rather good-looking."&#xD;
"And'gallantP'&#xD;
"And talented?" with emphasis.&#xD;
"Is he?" with a mischievous smile and rather doubtful.&#xD;
"Of course he is."&#xD;
"And why of course?"&#xD;
"Because I never have blockheads around me, and I&#xD;
do assure you he can read, understand, and digest more&#xD;
of Blackstone in an houi; than most men can in a day."&#xD;
"I hope he's altogether worthy of such a wariii adher-&#xD;
ent," said the niece smiling.&#xD;
"lie is, and if you had the penetration for which IL&#xD;
have given you credit, you would have seen it for your-&#xD;
self. But tell me, what did 'you read yesterday?" foi' it&#xD;
must be known that Mr. hall had advised a course of&#xD;
reading for his niece, which he was directing, and it was&#xD;
his custom at breakfast to converse with her of what' she&#xD;
had read the day previous.&#xD;
"In the first place, I read Plutarch's Lives, as you sug-&#xD;
gested, of IDemosthenes and Cicero."'&#xD;

" Well, what did you discover about the illustrious&#xD;
two?"&#xD;
"A singular coincidence;" and as she hesitated, her&#xD;
uncle asked:&#xD;
"What was it?"&#xD;
"That while both were so eloquent, both were so cow-&#xD;
ardly. Oil, in other words, no men could so eloquently&#xD;
remind their countrymen of their duty, and no men&#xD;
could abandon that duty more ingloriously than they did,&#xD;
when the hour of danger caine."&#xD;
"But they had not made military art a study," said&#xD;
the uncle for the purpose of making her defend her po-&#xD;
sition.&#xD;
"No man need study any art to know how to defend&#xD;
his country, if he has a sparkof patriotism in his breast,"&#xD;
was the enthusiastic reply.&#xD;
"But statesmen are needed quite as much as soldiers,&#xD;
for who would make laws and carry on the government,&#xD;
if you put all the legislators in the field?"&#xD;
"There's no time for making laws when one's country&#xD;
is invaded, and every man is needed to drive back the&#xD;
foe," answered Gertrude with sparkling eyes..&#xD;
Admitting you are right, iF every man went into&#xD;
the army, who would take care ~f the women and chil.&#xD;
dren?"&#xD;
"Why, they would take care of themselves, and if need&#xD;
be, help the men fight!" -&#xD;
"Why, Gertrude, you would make a second Joan of&#xD;
Arc!"&#xD;
"I hope I should, if my country needed ~&#xD;

~ANGELS AND MINISTERS OF. GRAOE~'~ ETC.  lit&#xD;
tion," said the uncle with a sigh, for he looked fork&#xD;
ward with gloomy forebodings to the future of hi~&#xD;
country.&#xD;
Regarding his niece with admiration, more for her ~Uw&#xD;
tellect tIia~ her beauty, ha asked with interest:&#xD;
"What else did you read yesterday?"&#xD;
"Singularly enough, I ~opened Gibbon at the life of&#xD;
IRienzi, just after completing that of the distinguished&#xD;
pair already discussed."&#xD;
"This was a little singular; and what aid you learn&#xD;
from the life of the great Tribune?"&#xD;
"Simply this: that men who drink and give unbridled&#xD;
license to their passions, can never become tbe proper~.&#xD;
leaders of others."&#xD;
"Wisely spoken-~wisely spoken! And what else did&#xD;
you read? Why, you interest me amazingly," said her&#xD;
uncle, and looking at her closely, he contemplated a brit-&#xD;
liant future for her, if she could only' be cured of the&#xD;
mad passion which at one time threatened both her h6p~s&#xD;
and life. To this end, and for the purpose of diverting&#xD;
her thoughts from herself, he had directed her mind in&#xD;
an unusual channel for women, at least in those days.&#xD;
Thus, instead 'of leaving her seeking consolation in&#xD;
Byron's insidious verses, or poring over some love-sick&#xD;
novel, he suggested to her the i'eading of such solid&#xD;
works as those under discussion, and was surprised to find&#xD;
her philosophizing upon su1~jects worthy of his own reflee-'&#xD;
tion. And this is where men underrate the gentle sex,&#xD;
for there are numbers of women whc have the ability to~&#xD;
cope successfully with them, if they were only educated&#xD;
to be anything but the fashion-plates which custom and~&#xD;
society make them.&#xD;

&#xD;
Gertrude seemed reflecting, and as she did not reply,&#xD;
her uncle said again:&#xD;
"Was this your day's work ?~'&#xD;
"No," she said, smiling, "for after closing Gibbon,&#xD;
what should I do but open iMiacaulay at the life of Machi-&#xD;
avelli ?"&#xD;
"Angels and ministers of grace defend us," exclaimed&#xD;
Mr. hall, laughing. "Well, do you learn anything from&#xD;
this man's life ?"&#xD;
"If I didn't, Mr. Macarilay fully convinced me that it&#xD;
matters very little how a man lives or what vile doctrines&#xD;
he disseminates, if he is sure of an apologist after he is&#xD;
dead."&#xD;
"1 believe he makes him the creature of circumstances."&#xD;
"Yes, and excuses him upon the plea that he was the&#xD;
exponent of the times in which he lived."&#xD;
"Well, child, we too must cultivate charity, but we&#xD;
must not practise evil because Machiavelli has taught us&#xD;
the science so artistically, or because Macaulay has seen&#xD;
lit to excuse and defend it. But come, you have enter-&#xD;
tamed me so well tbis morning, that the time is slipping&#xD;
by and my duties are being neglected. You fell upon a&#xD;
singular quartette yesterday, but you have profited by&#xD;
the lives of these men, and with nice discrimination have&#xD;
judged each character according to his just deserts. Jim-&#xD;
prove to-day as well, and when you are through with&#xD;
your reading, come to me. I have some copying I wish&#xD;
you to do."&#xD;
With these words he entered the library and sat down&#xD;
to his writing. Leaning ovei him, Gertrude kissed his&#xD;
- brow and botook herself to her books, of which she was&#xD;
daily becoming more fond.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
NOT MANLY.&#xD;
T~IFFOIRD, my deai' boy, you will ruin yourself&#xD;
if you continue to drink as you have been doing&#xD;
for the last two months," said Judge Baker one&#xD;
day; and there was deep concern in his face as he spoke,&#xD;
for he loved his nephew, and it pained him inexpressibly&#xD;
to see him throwing himself away as he was doing.&#xD;
Clifford's face was flushed, and his uncle knew he was not&#xD;
himself, when he looked up and asked:&#xD;
"Whose business is it if I do?" for he was distin-&#xD;
guished for the respect with which he universally treated&#xD;
every one. It was rather an inopportune time to speak to&#xD;
him, but as it was now too late to recede, the judge,&#xD;
drawing a chair up near to his nephew, said:&#xD;
"It is the business of all who love you as I do."&#xD;
His tone, which was kin4 and affectionate, had its effect&#xD;
upon Clifford, amid grasping his uncle's hand, he said:&#xD;
"Do you love me?"&#xD;
So love it seems was the need of this young man's life&#xD;
-the one thing which family, friends, and money had&#xD;
failed to bestow, and without which there was nothing.&#xD;
"Certainly I love you, Clifford, as if you were my own&#xD;
soiin, amid feel the same interest in you. We all love you&#xD;
-your mother-your father-"&#xD;
"Stop! Never repeat such mockery to me as that!&#xD;

god, which is money, he would sacrifice wife, children,&#xD;
friends, soul, ever ! Look at my sisters! Married&#xD;
to brutes, because they had money! Look at me! sacri~&#xD;
ficed to my father's pride and married to an innocent&#xD;
woman, whose life mus.tpass and end in misery."&#xD;
"But misfortune overtook your father, Clifford, and .i~&#xD;
is not manly for you to talk so."&#xD;
"No;         manly to have a he~rt, I know."&#xD;
"Why, you talk about love like a woman," replied his&#xD;
uncle, with something akin to a sneer.&#xD;
"Because I love like a woman, and Jam not ashamed&#xD;
of it.'~&#xD;
"But love is not the one great desideratum of life."&#xD;
"What is?"&#xD;
"Have you no ambition?"&#xD;
"Not for ambition's sake: but had I married the&#xD;
womar~ of my choice, I should have had ambition for her&#xD;
sake."&#xD;
"But you are not alone in this respect, for very few&#xD;
men marry the women of their choice. And would you&#xD;
throw away your life for a disappointment that comes to&#xD;
almost every one?"&#xD;
"You may treat it lightly, but this disappointment at&#xD;
which you sneer has made me so wretched that I no&#xD;
longer care to live. And every time III enter the presence&#xD;
of her whom I have so deeply injured, I feel as if I would&#xD;
~'ather die, than stand before her with the lie which is&#xD;
branded on my soul." And while he. walked the floor&#xD;
ex ~trdly, his uncle sat perplexed, not knowing what&#xD;
ci' argument to use.&#xD;
ino time passed thus, when evidently a new thought&#xD;
ocwwrod to the Judge, for he looked up and said:&#xD;
&#xD;
NOT MANLY.&#xD;
&#xD;
115&#xD;
&#xD;
"have you no family pride?"&#xD;
"Noble88e oblige made me what I am, and no6le~e&#xD;
obliqe will be my ruin!"&#xD;
"Do you not love your mother?"&#xD;
"Not love my mother?" and pressing his hand to his&#xD;
brow, he looked at the man in amazement, who could ask&#xD;
such question.&#xD;
"Not lve my mother?" he said again, Thinking per-&#xD;
haps he had not heard aright.&#xD;
It was a happy hit, the moment was auspicious, and&#xD;
taking advantage of it~the Judge hurried to say-&#xD;
"Have you no ambition to be worthy of one who idol-&#xD;
izes you as your mother does?"&#xD;
In an excited manner he said:&#xD;
"Tell me how I can do it?"&#xD;
"By not drinking, by being true to those precepts which&#xD;
she taught you, and which your own nobility of soul will&#xD;
tell you are right."&#xD;
Turning away, he said with a sigh:&#xD;
"My poor mother! God knows I would not give her&#xD;
a pang, if I could help it."&#xD;
"Let it be the work of your life to try and help it.&#xD;
You have marked ability, and a brilliant future awaits&#xD;
you if you will only be true to yourself."&#xD;
"And what are the honors of men without happiness,"&#xD;
said Clifford with a sigh, as he walked back and forth the&#xD;
office, with eyes downcast and arms folded behind.&#xD;
"Perhaps the honors may bring happiness. *Banish&#xD;
love, and ~ut ambition in your heart! ."&#xD;
"And is this your advice?" asked Clifford, pausing in.&#xD;
his walk and casting an ilbconcealed look of scorn upon&#xD;
the speaker~&#xD;

nToT MAL.&#xD;

INEVITABLE&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is-because one is dishonorable, while the other is&#xD;
an honorable possibility."&#xD;
Then turning away, Clifford said in despair:&#xD;
"My God, if this is tlie beginning of life, what will be&#xD;
the end?"&#xD;
A few ~moments, passed without a word, and then the&#xD;
Judge said:&#xD;
"But all this is not what I wished- to say to you, Clif-&#xD;
ford. What I wished to say was this: that your drink.&#xD;
ing is being very much talked about, and that if you do&#xD;
- not stop it and give more attention to your affairs, you&#xD;
will surely be defeated. In a few days you are to meet&#xD;
your constituents again. Go to work now in time, prepare&#xD;
a speech worthy of yourself in the meantime, do no~&#xD;
tou~,h a drop, and you may yet have it in your power to&#xD;
turn. the tide again in your favor before it is too late.&#xD;
Willyon do it?"&#xD;
Taking him by the hand, Clifford said:&#xD;
"' Since you tako' such an interest in me, I will try?"&#xD;
and without any other words, the Judge repaired to the&#xD;
court-room, and Clifford remained shut in his office in a&#xD;
state of mind ~bordering on frenzy. The vigilant spirit of&#xD;
the Evil One knew it was an anspicio~is moment, a~d lost&#xD;
no time in pouring fresh poison into the already bleeding&#xD;
heart of the young m4. It whispered :&#xD;
"happiness is a myt ~i; duty, a cruel infliction; and life,&#xD;
a curse." Thus, thought became torture; with each mo-&#xD;
ment the craving in his heart plead for even a short re-&#xD;
spite from the stings of memory; and forgetting all his&#xD;
pledges, he sought relief once more in the vile habit&#xD;
which was daily tightening its clamp upon him.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;

hAT a subtle thing love is," said Paul Maxwell&#xD;
to Gertrude one evening, as they rested, after a&#xD;
long walk, upon a rustic seat in the lawn at&#xD;
"Pleasant Retreat."&#xD;
Love again! Of course!&#xD;
No matter how much the world may laugh, no matter&#xD;
bow much the world may sne9r, yet into each life will this&#xD;
little thing, called love, creep, sooner or later. And how&#xD;
much or bow little it influences the lives of men may&#xD;
never be known to others, but the scars which it inflicts&#xD;
npo~m their hearts will go with them down to their graves.-&#xD;
"Yes," said Gertrude, with a guilty start, as if her se-&#xD;
eret had been discovered.&#xD;
"You cannot see it, you cannot hear it, you cannot&#xD;
touch it, you cannot taste it-you.&#xD;
"But you can feel it," said Gertrude with an impulse&#xD;
which she regretted, but could not recall.&#xD;
"Yes, you can. feel it," was the quick rejoinder, as Paul&#xD;
reiterated her words; and- gleaming over, he gave her a&#xD;
burning glance, which startled her, for her woman's in-&#xD;
stiiict told her better' than words what it meant. Until&#xD;
then, she had rested in: a security that was based upon&#xD;
the old love which she fancie4 she had forgotten, and2&#xD;
never suspecting that her very indifference but whetted de-&#xD;
sire in Paul's heart, after the usual manner with which&#xD;
we all - seek the impossible. That they had known -each&#xD;

INEVITABLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
other scarce three months didn't matter, for Paul was as&#xD;
madly and as completely in love as if it had been the&#xD;
work of a lifetime. To the student of human nature,&#xD;
this will be no matter of surprise, and upon the day they&#xD;
met, we wrote it down as inevitable. Unlike most of her&#xD;
sex, Gertrude was neither a coquette nor a flirt, and her&#xD;
affections had been so deeply enlisted for Clif.frrd Troup,&#xD;
that it seemed. like sacrilege for any other man to speak&#xD;
of love to her. Thus, feeling so secure from the fascina-&#xD;
tions of any one, it never seemed to occur to her that any&#xD;
one should be fascinated with her. Now that she knew&#xD;
it, it appeared absurd; for Paul felt much more like a&#xD;
brother, than a lover. She regretted it deeply; but what&#xD;
could be done ~ She could not prevent it, and to cure it&#xD;
-was quite another thing. And thus they sat- both&#xD;
busy with their own thoughts, the one wishing to be, tl~e&#xD;
other wishing not to be--loved. The sun went down, the&#xD;
daylight lingered,, the summer twilight came slowly on,&#xD;
the stars c~me tripping forth, the evening air fanned their&#xD;
diceks, aiii~ still-they said nothing.&#xD;
Not desiring to renew the conversation, Gertrude arose,&#xD;
and after a long and embarrassing silence, said:&#xD;
"1 must go now; uncle will be waiting for me."&#xD;
"Stay a little whUe-stay until I tell you that I love&#xD;
you ~ and taking both her hands in his, Paul pressed them&#xD;
to his lips.&#xD;
Withdrawing them, gently, she said:&#xD;
"But y~u must not love me and turning, walked&#xD;
rapidly in the direction of the house.&#xD;
"Must not. love you?" said Paul, following her. But&#xD;
she did not answer him, and as they neared the house he&#xD;
said again:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why must4 not love you?"&#xD;
"Because-I--------." But the words were never&#xD;
uttered, for t1~ey were then at the porch, where Mr. Hall&#xD;
sat awaiting them and indulging in all kinds of castles,&#xD;
in which they figured most conspicuously. The ever-faith-&#xD;
ful "Rio" was lying at his feet, and wreaths of smoke&#xD;
from the inevitable pipe circled about his head.&#xD;
"You are late, my child," said the uncle.&#xD;
"But none the less welcome, I hope," was the pfayful&#xD;
rejoinder, as she stooped and kissed him.&#xD;
"Certainly not, when you give me such a greeting;"&#xD;
and he seated her upon his knee.&#xD;
"Don't you envy me, Paul ?"&#xD;
"Indeed I do, sir, and I only hope&#xD;
"S upper's ready, masterr" interrupted "Ellen."&#xD;
* "Hope what?" asked Mr. Rall.&#xD;
"I only hope that one of these days I'll have ~a niec~&#xD;
to love me, for Pm sadly in need of some one to love&#xD;
me.&#xD;
"Tnt, tnt, what nonsense! when half the girls in~ the~&#xD;
village are in love with you. Come in to supper, and don't&#xD;
talk such nonsense any more."&#xD;
"You must ex~nse me this evening, sir ; good-evening; "~&#xD;
and bowiiig distantly he walked slowly away, to the blank&#xD;
amazement of the sage, who stood looking after him and.&#xD;
wondering what was to pay. of&#xD;
"What's the matter now?" asked Mr. Hall Gertrude,&#xD;
as the truth instantly washed upon him.&#xD;
"Matter?" asked Gertrude.' "With whom?"&#xD;
".Why, with Paul; that's some of your doings, G~r.&#xD;
trude. I suspected as much, when you were out ~olate."~&#xD;
"Suspected what, uncle?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8257-00000060"/>&#xD;
120               INEVITABLE.                                                  INEVITABLE.              121&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why, do you think I don't know? I suppose it isn't&#xD;
enough to trifle with one man, but true to the instincts of&#xD;
your sex, you must go on scattering ruin wherever you.&#xD;
go.&#xD;
"Oh,* uncle, what an unjust accusation 1" and she was&#xD;
ready to cry, for she could not bear to think that her un-&#xD;
cle thought so poorly of her as that. Seeing that she was&#xD;
really wounded, he hurried to say:&#xD;
"Then forgive m~, child; but I love that boy, and II&#xD;
don't want you to fool with him."&#xD;
"Nothing is farther from my thoughts or wishes; and&#xD;
to prove my sincerity, I must tell you that I have just de-&#xD;
clined listening to his avowals."&#xD;
"What?" said the uncle in surprise; but not wishing to&#xD;
reveal his feelings on the subject, he said: "Come, let's&#xD;
go in to' supper ~" and taking his arm, they entered the&#xD;
dining-room.&#xD;
For a little while Mr. TIall sat thinking, for although&#xD;
he was very far from being a match-maker, yet somehow&#xD;
or other, away down in his heart, he had hoped that Gei'-&#xD;
trude and Paul would fancy each other, and he was dis-&#xD;
a to have this little desire frustrated so soon.'&#xD;
Gertrude made a pretence of eating some bonny-clabber,&#xD;
of which she was very fond, and said nothing, for Paul's&#xD;
love gave her real pain, and in her heart she wished it&#xD;
could have been otherwise. Tile dogs and the waiters all&#xD;
seemed to partake of the mood of master and mistress,&#xD;
~hd not a word was spoken, until "iRio" made known&#xD;
his wants by a whine.&#xD;
"And does my good friend want his supper?" asked&#xD;
the master; which question being followed by several&#xD;
whines and barks, with variations, supposed to mean&#xD;
&#xD;
"yes," he was given a biscuit, and "Fanny" ordered to&#xD;
give him his supper, which was always placed on the&#xD;
earthh for him.&#xD;
"It's a shame, uncle, how you neglect 'Troup' for&#xD;
'Rio,' and I intend to take special charge of~ the poor&#xD;
old blind creature;" and her uncle watched her as she&#xD;
stroked him tendei'ly on the head, then fed him, for he&#xD;
knew the name was the attraction. But, as yet, she didn't&#xD;
know that he knew it.&#xD;
"But that's the way; our friends always desert us when&#xD;
w~ are in4rouble, and when we are growing old."&#xD;
"'And pray, where did you learn so much misan-&#xD;
thropy?"&#xD;
~" Ne~r mind, I learned it; besides, 'Rio' is petted&#xD;
and spoiled by everybody, and because poor old 'Troup'&#xD;
can't s~e, he is neglected."&#xD;
If you only knew how devotedly ' Rio' loves me, you'&#xD;
wouldn't wonder that it is returned. Why, have you not&#xD;
noticed how jealous lie is of you?"&#xD;
"No, I hadn't."&#xD;
"Well, now, notice, every time you come near me, or&#xD;
hiss me, he looks up with a sad, knowing look, and&#xD;
crouches as closely as possible to rue. Try it. Come and&#xD;
sit on my knee, and put your arms around my neck."&#xD;
She did as her uncle requested 'when the dog immedi~&#xD;
ately left his supper, and when she said:&#xD;
"This is my master, 'Rio,' '~ he put his fore-paws up on&#xD;
his master's shi~ulder and whined as if Gertrude was do~&#xD;
ing something terrible to him, and it was with diflicnlty&#xD;
that Mr. Hall could make him lie down. So faithful and&#xD;
devoted are these poor, dumb creatures, that we think&#xD;
their example is worthy of imitation by men. Seeing hOW&#xD;

&#xD;
~.t worried the dog for her to keep her position, Gertrude&#xD;
took another seat, and crouching at his master's feet, "IRio'~&#xD;
watched his rival out of the corners of his big black eyes,&#xD;
while Mr. Hall said:&#xD;
"J will tell you of an act of his devotion. Some years&#xD;
ago, I had a friend stopping with me, and we were going&#xD;
over to W-to a political meeting. The cars not running&#xD;
to suit our engagement, we went from here in a top-buggy.&#xD;
'Rio' had been with me on many of these trips, but as&#xD;
he was very annoying at houses where I stopped, I deter-&#xD;
mined to leave him at home that time; so, I not only sent&#xD;
him back, but made 'Harry' come and take him by force.&#xD;
We drove on for some miles, and forgetting all about the&#xD;
dog, stopped at a creek to water our horse when a&#xD;
shower of rain came up, and upon raising the top of&#xD;
th~ buggy, who should be coiled up back there but 'Mis-&#xD;
ter Rio.' Determined not to be outdone, I got out of the&#xD;
buggy and drove him back home, as I thought foi~ good,&#xD;
and we went on our journey alone. The next day, how-&#xD;
ever, when the train passed 0-, 'Rio,' who had re-&#xD;
turned home, got on the cars, went down to C ,the sta-&#xD;
tion where they change cars for W , made the change,&#xD;
and upon arriving at W----, jumped off the train and&#xD;
came panting almost out of breath to the hotel where I&#xD;
was stopping. What do you think of that?"&#xD;
"That it almost equals any fish-story I ever heard;"&#xD;
and provoked as he was, the uncle was obliged to&#xD;
laugh.&#xD;
"It's the truth, whether you believe it or not," he reit-&#xD;
erated. "Isn't it, 'Rio'?" and a wag of the tail seemed&#xD;
to say ~&#xD;
"Ab! but, uncle, you know what elastic cQnscienee8 you&#xD;
&#xD;
ThIEVITABLfl.            123&#xD;
lawyers and politicians do have, and sometimes we have&#xD;
to take what you say cum g~ctnq."&#xD;
Thus, while the uncle and niece sat talking, the disap-&#xD;
pointed io~er~plunged deeper and 1~arther into the woods,&#xD;
as if seeking to get away from himself. He was in 1 ye,&#xD;
and because ~at love was not returned, he was miserable.&#xD;
And yet there are people in the world who will laugh at&#xD;
this, and call it boyish. But they who can treat the&#xD;
noblest sentiment of the human heart so lightly, know&#xD;
nothing of the bliss of loving and being loved, and may&#xD;
they never know the agony of loving and being disap-&#xD;
pointed.&#xD;

TRIUMPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
TRIUMPH!&#xD;
HIRTY years ago, a barbecue was regarded with&#xD;
nearly the Same reverence that welcomed the&#xD;
memorable fourth of July; but now, since free&#xD;
dom means to be manacled in a prison outside of your&#xD;
own State, and patriotism means to steal as much as you&#xD;
can from the. best government on the earth, why, these&#xD;
ancient holidays are far too pAmitive and virtuous to~&#xD;
attract the progressive men who sit at the political helm.&#xD;
Then, honest Farmer Trot donned his brag suit of blue&#xD;
and white checks which he was proud to say had been&#xD;
woven by B~tsey's own hands, and hitching the oxen to&#xD;
the cart, took B6tsey and the children, all in their best&#xD;
bib and tucker, to the barbecue, as the event of the season.&#xD;
Pigs roasted whole, barbecued lambs, and cider were the&#xD;
standard dishes and drinks, and among the penalties of&#xD;
being a candidate were kissing the babies of constituents,&#xD;
patting their pet dogs on the head, flattering the old&#xD;
Women, and drinking cider with the yQung ones, with&#xD;
now and then a promise from some proud mother to&#xD;
name her next boy for hini. But, alas! those good old&#xD;
times 'are gone-the free air of heaven is ignored along&#xD;
with the rights of free (~) citizens, and instead of the old~&#xD;
fashioned barbecue, we have modei'n mass-meetings held&#xD;
in dusty, crowded cities, in halls that are carpeted,~ while&#xD;
"Jersey Lightnin&amp;amp;' takes the place of cider, and fri@.&#xD;
&#xD;
ass Jes and m6ringues are ostentatiously' exchanged for&#xD;
roast pig and barbecued lamb. Pet dogs and crying&#xD;
babies are left at home, and the Farmer Trot. of toAay,&#xD;
with his Betsey, the one in "tights," the other in o4igmon~&#xD;
and pan~ier, having come to town by theA "keers," are&#xD;
quite indignant to find themselves seated in the gallery /&#xD;
along with the "poor white trash" and "niggers." In&#xD;
those good old days, men voted for-principles, and they,&#xD;
absolutely loved their country so much, that they would&#xD;
as soon have thought of putting spurious coin in the Ooin~&#xD;
union Alms, as of sending b~ men to legislate for&#xD;
them. But all that is changed now-temperance and&#xD;
patriotism are two old fogies that are set aside, and men&#xD;
vote for those, who, by their superior knowledge of the&#xD;
complex machinery of the Treasury Department, or other&#xD;
behind the scene villany, can furnish the largest amount&#xD;
of spoils and the smallest amount of principles.&#xD;
Some persons consider this the most corrupt age of the&#xD;
world; but we are not quite certain that we agree with&#xD;
them, for there are still good men who proclaim Go~d's&#xD;
eternal truths, and there are some believers among their&#xD;
listeners. But leaving philosopher's, philanthropists, and.&#xD;
ministers to fight the battles of the present, we ~Will re~&#xD;
turn to the barbecue of thirty years ago, where the fatted&#xD;
calf had been killed in honor of Clifford Troup, the&#xD;
youthful aspirant for the position of representative from~&#xD;
the stanch old county of' T&#xD;
There were n~ great issues at stake in those days~ and&#xD;
the country w~s movingg along as quietly as it ever can,&#xD;
with such frequent elections, and ignorance as powerful&#xD;
at the ballot-box as intelligence. But when the young&#xD;
candidate arose, he was greeted with as much enthusiasm&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8257-00000063"/>&#xD;
126                   TRIuMPn.                                                       TRITTMPII.                127&#xD;
&#xD;
a&amp;amp; if he had been some conquering hero returning from&#xD;
a victorious ~ampaign. This, perhaps, was to be attrib-&#xD;
uted to a recognition of the past services of his father&#xD;
and family, who had always been exceedingly popular in&#xD;
the State, and who had ever borne themselves with satis.&#xD;
faction and ability when entrusted with office.&#xD;
Clifford was very y~ale, when he stood before the eager,&#xD;
honest faces of the people whom he proposed to represent,&#xD;
while the dark circles under his. eyes were suggestive of&#xD;
suffering, and a strong will, was barely sufficient to con-&#xD;
ceal a nervous tremulousness which was caused from&#xD;
abstinence that morning~ This unusual abstemiousness&#xD;
had been effected by the earnest solicitations of Judge&#xD;
Baker, who knew full well that if the honest, temperate&#xD;
countryy people saw any symptoms of intoxication in their&#xD;
candidate, that he would surely be defeated. Clifford&#xD;
was by nature an 'orator, combining a polish and strength&#xD;
Which was rare in so young a speaker. What he said was&#xD;
so ~vell and yet so simply said, that his words impressed&#xD;
both the learned and untaught; and in consideration of&#xD;
this fact, it is no matter of surprise that he held the&#xD;
uninterrupted attention of his audience for nearly three&#xD;
hours. To earnestness, he added a wit which 'relieved&#xD;
the tedium of sober truths and facts, and a satire which&#xD;
could breathe the most polished but most scathing denun.&#xD;
ciatjons when necessity demanded; 'and when he took his&#xD;
seat, the woods rang with cheers which prophesied an&#xD;
overwhelming victory at the ensuing election.. Judge&#xD;
Baker, who had represented the county for many years,&#xD;
and who had declined, the nomination in favor of his&#xD;
nephew, being then loudly called for, responded in a&#xD;
&amp;amp;hort but appropriate speech. He was then followed by&#xD;
&#xD;
two or three lesser lights, after which they mingled with&#xD;
the people and partook of the bounteous barbecue which&#xD;
had been prepared for the occasion~&#xD;
Clifford was very much exhausted, and the desire for&#xD;
the accustomed drinks, burning like a consuming fire&#xD;
within him, superseded every other thought. He was&#xD;
restless, nervous, abstracted, miserable; and so will every&#xD;
man be, who once lets the poisonous alcohol madden&#xD;
his veins, by mingling its impurity with his life-blood.&#xD;
Once taken, it creates an unquenchable thirst which cries&#xD;
for more, more, more; and with such overwhelming&#xD;
fury does this appetite increase, that the honors of the&#xD;
world, love of family, pride; ambition, position, amid even&#xD;
the hope of Eternity itself, will be given in exchange for&#xD;
the one drink of which the victim has been deprived for&#xD;
a few short hours.&#xD;
And what is this desire after all? It is but a beastly&#xD;
appetit~-a craving of the stomach which conquers the&#xD;
intellect, and makes demons of its followers.&#xD;
Clifford could not eat, and after drinking several cups&#xD;
of strong coffee, and trying in vain to talk to his friends,&#xD;
he proposed to his uncle that they should go. Appreciate&#xD;
ing, as well as a sober man can, the struggle Clifford was&#xD;
making, Judge Baker yielded~ to his request; for they'&#xD;
had a long drive, and after many apologies for him,&#xD;
whom he represented as not being well, they said good-&#xD;
by, and took their departure, ami~1st the deafening ciThers&#xD;
of those simpl&amp;amp;.min4ed people, who believed t~he story&#xD;
they had heard.&#xD;
Not well! What little words tQ~ express the fearful&#xD;
disease which racked the body and mind of Clifford&#xD;
Troup.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8257-00000064"/>&#xD;
128                 TRTUMPIr.                                                  TIUMPfl.       -       129&#xD;
&#xD;
Not 'well! no; nor would he ever be again, without a&#xD;
strong will aided by Divine assistance. Soon after they&#xD;
had left the happy crowd, Judge Baker said:&#xD;
"It has been a day of triumph for you, Clifford, kind I&#xD;
congratulate you. upon your success."&#xD;
"I am 'honored, if you think there is cause for congrat-&#xD;
ulation in anything I have done," answered Clifford,&#xD;
sadly.&#xD;
"The triumph has not been so great over your con-&#xD;
stituents as over yourself; and I hope that this is the&#xD;
beginning of a reformation which shall be Permanent;"&#xD;
and he looked from the corners of his eyes beneath the&#xD;
hat of his listener, to see what effect his words would&#xD;
have, but Clifford made 'no reply; for even then the&#xD;
desire for a drinkwas so great, that it was difficult for&#xD;
him to conceal his impatience.&#xD;
What a state~of mind t~ be in! And yet those men&#xD;
who are slaves to this vile habit will here f~iicl a true&#xD;
picture of their inmost thoughts. They 'm~iy not ac-&#xD;
knowledge it, but there is one Eye that sees and knows&#xD;
the inner workings of this secret foe.&#xD;
The rest of the drive was made in silence, and it was&#xD;
full of apprehension for Judge Bakei', as to the 'future of&#xD;
him who sat beside him; while Clifford's whole life, past,&#xD;
present, and future, was merged into one idea, and that&#xD;
idea was, the' quickest way to obtain a drink. how de-&#xD;
grading! and did we not propose writing the truth, we&#xD;
should hesitate before blottino~ these pages with such&#xD;
hiunan depravity, or exposing such human weaknesses.&#xD;
But the writer who would do good must not shrink from&#xD;
telling the truth, no matter how painful it If~~ no matter&#xD;
how much he would shield the creatures of his imagina~&#xD;
&#xD;
tion' from the condemnation of the world. Arid who&#xD;
knows but that God is using him as anginstrument of&#xD;
good, and perchance the words which he writes may be&#xD;
the means of arousing some heart to a sense of its neg-&#xD;
lected duties, or reclaiming some recreant, who before&#xD;
seemed joined to his idols.&#xD;
Then, with this end in view, let no writer prove a mis-&#xD;
creant to the sacred trust reposed in.him; do not let him&#xD;
write for his own self-exaltptioii; do not let bun pndei&#xD;
to the tastes of the public, by flattering vice at the sacri-&#xD;
fice of virtue, but let him use all his influence to elevate&#xD;
the standard of morality, and to glorify God. This shall&#xD;
be our aim; and if we advocate the right, it will not be&#xD;
because we love to disclose unpleasant truths, but for the&#xD;
higher purpose of doing good, and of warning tIi~ inex-&#xD;
perienced seafarer of the breakers ahead. herein the&#xD;
authors task has never been fully appreciated; for who'&#xD;
caii doubt but that it would be infinitely more agreeable&#xD;
to delineate a perfect than an imperfect character? But&#xD;
the question here arise~, "Does a perfect. character&#xD;
exist?" If we reject the idea of original sin, and be-&#xD;
lieve God a cruel, unjust Judge, who pei'secutes us&#xD;
because lie loves to do it, then a faultless being may&#xD;
and everlastin~ damnation may be the myth which&#xD;
exist,           b&#xD;
fashionable philosophers and the followers of idealisms&#xD;
tell us that it is. But, accepting the revealed religion of&#xD;
Christ, and philosophizing upon the weaknesses of human&#xD;
nature, we shall endeavor to do good, by laying bare the&#xD;
cause and effect of those evils which' are tolerated, if not&#xD;
encouraged, by society. But we would not ha.ve our&#xD;

these pages, they. would understand that we were fulfib&#xD;
ling a cruel destiny, rather than yielding to an agreeable&#xD;
pastime.&#xD;
But while we have been wandering, the Judge 4and&#xD;
Clifford have driven quietly along, entering the village&#xD;
just as the purple shades of twilight were settling down&#xD;
upon its deserted streets. Being very much fatigued,&#xD;
the Judge sought the nearest route home; but Cljfford ar~&#xD;
rested this movement so far as he was concerned, for as&#xD;
they drove thrQugh the torn, he said:&#xD;
"Let me out here: I must go by the office."&#xD;
Fearing there was some hidden purpose behind these&#xD;
words, the kind-hearted Judge said:&#xD;
"You had better come home with me, Clifford."&#xD;
"P11 be up soon," lie replied, without looking back;&#xD;
and while the Judge drove sadly home, his nephew en-&#xD;
tered j The Everglades," a den of iniquity, where the&#xD;
keeper trifled with human souls, and only kept his ow~&#xD;
record steady, for the greedy love of gain.&#xD;
Calling for whiskey, Clifford seemed annoyed that the&#xD;
man only half filled the glass, for his long abstinence had&#xD;
made him desperate, and when lie held the goblet up and&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Fill it," there was such determination in his voice&#xD;
as made this devil's serving-man treml)le and obey.&#xD;
The mere fact of having swallowed the long-cQveted&#xD;
drink brought satisfaction, and even before the poison&#xD;
had time to make itself felt in the effect desired, he ac-&#xD;
cepted the invitation of a friend Q) to join him in a&#xD;
game of cards. TI~~ game had not proceeded far, before&#xD;
Clifford (~aIled fQr ~another drink, and the friend Q) who&#xD;
&#xD;
drank nothing, ordered a bottle of brandy for the especial&#xD;
benefit of the man whose purse lie was draining. Mat-&#xD;
ters went on thus for some hours,~ and ClifFord kept los..&#xD;
ing and drinking, until reason was dethroned, sleep o~er~&#xD;
came him, and his friend (?) and the bar-keeper put him&#xD;
to bed in a back room, which was specially reserved for&#xD;
the weak and unfortunate. Here he slept until morning,&#xD;
and then, like a guilty wretch, crept home to his anxious&#xD;
and distracted wife.&#xD;
And this was the ending of a day of Triumph!&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
DESPAIR!&#xD;
*      OTJNG and envied, but in despair! How strange,&#xD;
that in our selfishness we ,ignore the claims of&#xD;
others, and do those things which shall not only&#xD;
recoil upon our own heads, but which sh ~dl make victims&#xD;
of those whom it should be our duty and pleasure to&#xD;
shield from suffering. Let no man or woman suppose&#xD;
that they can do ~vromg without giving pain to others&#xD;
than themselves; for we all have families, to say nothing&#xD;
of friends, who shall be made happy or wretched by opr&#xD;
conduct.&#xD;
Then, let us pause, if not for our own sakes, out of&#xD;
consideration for those who have claims up~m us, before&#xD;
committing acts which shall perhaps plunge the hearts&#xD;
of those dear ones in mourning. If Clifford Jiad thought&#xD;
for an instant that his conduct had any effect upon his&#xD;
wife, the knowledge might have had some, influence, fQr,&#xD;
naturally, no man had a higher regard for her sex than&#xD;
he did. But, wrapped in the gloomy mantle of his own&#xD;
sad. thoughts, he almost ignored her existence, never sus~&#xD;
pecting that she might possibly be as wretched ~s him&#xD;
self. And how gould he ever know it? She never coxn~&#xD;
pIained~-she never remonstrated. No. For although&#xD;
gentleness itself she had that strength within which can&#xD;
endui~e in silence nutil the heart breaks. There are some&#xD;
&#xD;
1k&#xD;
&#xD;
few women like this, who, though physically weak, are&#xD;
morally strong; but the world is none the wiser, for they&#xD;
pine away in secret, and die without a murmur, some~&#xD;
times even their husbands failing to observe thek tears&#xD;
that ~vil1 come, the sighs ~that will not be suppressed,&#xD;
the paling cheek, the unsteady gait, which to an anxious,&#xD;
loving eye would be more expressive than words. We&#xD;
repeat that husbands do not remark these prophetic but&#xD;
silent signs. Why? Because they are too busy with&#xD;
themselves-too busy with the world. They haven't&#xD;
time to feed a starving soul, and less inclination to watch&#xD;
the breaking of. a human heart. So the body is nour~&#xD;
ished, so the material is cared for, what else is there for&#xD;
husbands to do? Nothing, sar~ly, unless the eye of love&#xD;
can see for itself.&#xD;
How different with a wife! Should the husband's&#xD;
brow be clouded, who so qiiiick to discover it as the wife?&#xD;
Who so ready to soothe, to encourage, to sympathize with,&#xD;
as she who has not even had a single word of love ~o help&#xD;
her bear her little grievances? But then, the petty- details&#xD;
of a woman's life are held in such contempt by men, that&#xD;
they do not think them worth a consideration. Ed their&#xD;
selfishness allow them to examine for themselves, they&#xD;
would find that not all time great troubles of men com~&#xD;
bined, are half so wearing as the thousand and one horrid&#xD;
little duties which daily devolve upon women, Sapping the&#xD;
fountains of their youth, and making them old while -yet&#xD;
young in years. It's to look after servants, to give out&#xD;

DESPAIR;.&#xD;
&#xD;
the duties of wife and mother; but suppose her husband&#xD;
should come home after she has had a day of unusual&#xD;
worry, and say, " Come, wife, leave? all your caPes now,&#xD;
and tAke a walk or a drive with me U' Do you not sup-&#xD;
pose her heart would be lighter for the attention? And&#xD;
then, if he should talk to her and tell her how he loved&#xD;
her, just as he used to do in the, olden time before they&#xD;
-were married, she would feel strengthened to meet any&#xD;
fate that should be sent upon her. This is a very little&#xD;
thing to do for one who has given her life, her love, her&#xD;
all, into his keeping-it is less than nothing to do for the&#xD;
mother~ of his children. Then, let husbands be more&#xD;
considerate, more thoughtful, and we shall see fewer wives&#xD;
prematurely old, with men in the Jrime of life; for all&#xD;
duty and no recreation will wear away a stone. A wom-&#xD;
an's whole life is a sacrifice, while a man's is 01)0 coin-&#xD;
paratively of choice. Now, let there be less sacrifice and&#xD;
more choice for the woman, and more sacrifice and less&#xD;
choice for the man; and while the one will be happici',&#xD;
the other will be nobler: for self-abnegation always in&#xD;
creases our self-esteem. Let the husband keep up the&#xD;
attentions to the wife which he gave to the sweetheart,&#xD;
and no matter how rugged life's journey may be, she will&#xD;
be prepared to defy its storms and to enjoy its cdins.&#xD;
But with these little things neglected, life becomes a&#xD;
painful disappointment, a cruel awakening from a beau-&#xD;
tiful ideal; and the yearning in the heart for that syim.&#xD;
pathy and tenderness which is denied it, can only be&#xD;
appeased in the grave, if, mercifully~, it is not satisfied in&#xD;
crime.&#xD;
From the evening of the bridal party to the present&#xD;
time, Virginia had heard, incidentally, of course (?), of&#xD;
&#xD;
Clifford's devotion to Gertrude Lawrence. This knowledge&#xD;
had been conveyed to her, not directly, but by hints and.&#xD;
insinuations and innuendoes-those cruel thrusts which,&#xD;
like stabs in the dark, rankle, but cannot be resented..&#xD;
And just here, we would -like to ask, why people cannot&#xD;
let well enough alone? Why is it that they abso~ utely&#xD;
seem to hate to see the happiness of another? A first,&#xD;
Virginia only laughed at what she considered a fancy of&#xD;
th&amp;amp; past; for she l6ved her husband devotedly, and did&#xD;
not doubt but that he returned that love. Suddenly,&#xD;
though, the trusting child developed into the jealous&#xD;
woman; and could the gossips have seen the agonizing&#xD;
traiisition,~We think even their slanderous tongues would&#xD;
have been silenced and their malice appeased. True,&#xD;
Clifford had never been very demonstrative towards her;&#xD;
and while he was thoroughly polite, he rarely kissed her,&#xD;
or bestowed upon her those delicate little attentions&#xD;
which a refined and sensitive woman loves and appre~&#xD;
cites. Simple child that she was, she had been happy&#xD;
in the belief that it was all right, until a iperciless shaft&#xD;
pierced her trusting, confiding heart; and now, her wom-&#xD;
an's instinct told her that he did not love her. A fear-&#xD;
ful discovery for either husband or wife to make, and a&#xD;
death-knell to idl future happiness. She knew now why&#xD;
he found no pleasure in her society, and why he absented&#xD;
himself from her presence. It was because he loved&#xD;
another, and in her tightened grasp she - held the proof,&#xD;
which was cruelly convincing.&#xD;
Being entirely free from the influence of anything but&#xD;
his own reason, the morning of the barbecue, and feeling&#xD;
more keenly than ever how deeply he had injured the wom-&#xD;
an whom he called wife, Clifford was unusually kind and&#xD;
&#xD;
135&#xD;

&#xD;
JoEs1AU,&#xD;
&#xD;
attentive to her. Following him to the gate, the tcar~&#xD;
sprang into her soft blue eyes, as he tenderly kissed her&#xD;
"g~od-by," and she stood watching him until he was out&#xD;
of sight.&#xD;
Thankful for even so small a crumb, she returned to&#xD;
the house in the happiest mood.&#xD;
"Good-morning, Marm Judy," she said to her laundress,&#xD;
who 'sat in her room awaiting her.&#xD;
"Good-mornin', Miss 'Ginia! Yer see I'se come &amp;amp;oon&#xD;
fur de close, kase it looked so unlikely fur rain, and here's&#xD;
some letters I'se bin had long time. Dey come out'mm&#xD;
Mars Clifford's pockets, and I'se bin layiii' off to fetch&#xD;
'em all dis time, but ever time I come, I forget~ 'em;"&#xD;
and she handed the letters to the young wife. They were&#xD;
soiled and crumpled, and thinking them of no imp~rtancc,&#xD;
she opened one, and her eye was riveted ,by these words:&#xD;
"My ow~ CLIFFORD -You ask me if I will always love you?&#xD;
how can you ask me such a question? Does not your own heart&#xD;
tell you? and wicked as it may be, I shall love you until I die.&#xD;
But Virginia could read no more; for the tears which&#xD;
sprang to her eyes blurred the words, and with a gasp,&#xD;
she buried her face in the pillow upon the lounge where&#xD;
she was sitting. She rested there but for a moment,&#xD;
though; then remembering that a pail' of curious c~es&#xD;
were upon her, she forced back her tears, and arising in&#xD;
great confusion, said:&#xD;
"The clothes are ready, Marm Judy, and f have no&#xD;
doubt Mr. Troup will be much obliged to you for taking&#xD;
care of the letters for him."&#xD;
"Dey's all right, is dey?" asked the sable creature,&#xD;

who was dying to sit down and tell "Mi~ 'Ginia," as she&#xD;
cahleti her, everything she knew, and more too.&#xD;
"I presume so," said Virginia, with a powerful effoi't&#xD;
to hide her feelings.&#xD;
"I jes thought dey bought be from his ole sweet-&#xD;
heart, Miss 'Trude Lawrinces-and dat was de ~son IL&#xD;
took sich good care on 'em, honey; and den, you know,&#xD;
Mars Clifford took to drinking' so hard jis afore he got&#xD;
married, dat I don't s'pose he ever know'd he ever sent&#xD;
'em out to wash."&#xD;
"Did ho love her so much?" asked the poor little&#xD;
wife timidly, for she was almost afraid to trust her voice,&#xD;
lest she should burst into tears.&#xD;
"Lor, chile, yes. Dey was onsep'rable-dey was jist&#xD;
like one-dey was togeder day and night; and de very&#xD;
last hour Mars Clifford ever spent in dis here town, afore&#xD;
he went to git married, was spent wid Miss 'Trude."&#xD;
Then stealing a glance at her listener, and seeing what&#xD;
a painful expression almost distorted her face; she hur-&#xD;
ried to add:&#xD;
"'Twas a shame, chile, too, and everybody said so."&#xD;
With a composure that was past understanding, and&#xD;
hoping against hope, Virginia said:&#xD;
"If lie loved her so much, why did he not marry&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
&#xD;
--          ~ ~ - ~.t~      ~~L1~4!&#xD;
&#xD;
"She be too pore," answered tne iusi~zy&#xD;
maker. Then, with a knowing shake of the head, she&#xD;
added:&#xD;
"Dress-maker's daughter nebber suit dem 'ristocratic&#xD;

The girl he loved was too poor, but I am rich, thought&#xD;
Virginia; and with a won~an's quick perception, she now&#xD;

&#xD;
saw the solution to what seemed a mystery a moment&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"But Mr. Troup is wealthy, or at least his father is,&#xD;
and it was not necessary for him to marry for money;"&#xD;
and again she tried to delude herself into the hope that&#xD;
there might be some mistake somewhere.&#xD;
~' tor', chile, you don't know nuffin, for folks sez dat&#xD;
ole Mr. Troup done broke all to smashes, and dat he&#xD;
married Mars ChifforA to you to save de Manner;" and&#xD;
having done all the harm she could, she took the 'clothes,&#xD;
and hobbling to the door on her stick, said:&#xD;
"But I must be goin'-ole folks will be ole folks, chile,&#xD;
you know, and dey always gabbles too much if dey ken&#xD;
git anybody to listen to 'em; so good-mornin'.",&#xD;
Then turning and seeing how distressed the poor child&#xD;
was, she added:&#xD;
"Don't take nuffin to heart I'se said, honey, kase it&#xD;
may be all stories, for ~people will talk and dey don't&#xD;
always tell de truf."&#xD;
But the warning came too late; the fangs of the ser-&#xD;
pent had deposited their poison; and no antidote could&#xD;
counteract the effect now.&#xD;
So, while the vile old mi8chief-maker hobbled off with&#xD;
a grin of satisfaction upon her bronzed face, th~ stricken&#xD;
wife sat pressing her hands upon her aching heart, and&#xD;
gazing into vacancy as if she would turn to stone.&#xD;
What~ a fearful awakening from a happy dream! For&#xD;
it is a terrible thing for a wife to realize that her husband,&#xD;
does not k~e her. He loved another, and had married&#xD;
her for her money. had she heard aright? Was she&#xD;
the same being of ai~i hour ago? Then she stood at the&#xD;
gate a blushing, trembling ehild, kissing her husband&#xD;
&#xD;
DESPAIR.           .      139&#xD;
"good-by." Now she was a full-grQwn wretch-&#xD;
edness had developed her. The agony of a lifetime was&#xD;
compressed into one short hour; and a~ she sat thei'e so&#xD;
still and rigid, the color faded out of her cheeks, the pain&#xD;
became more intense in her heart, the dark circles be-&#xD;
neath her tearless eyes deepened, and she seemed turmng&#xD;
into marble. Despair was written in every feature of&#xD;
her sweet, girlish face, and life was over for her before, it&#xD;
had begun, for she was one of the few whom grief kills.&#xD;
No tears came to her relief; nor could she seek consola-&#xD;
tion from friendship, for not even to her own mother&#xD;
would she cOnfide the fatal secret of that morning. For&#xD;
why kill her mQther? ~o; she woul&amp;amp; die for him she&#xD;
loved, for she was in his way. He wanted her money.&#xD;
Well, he might have it, both while she was here and&#xD;
after she was gone. These were the thoughts that Vir-&#xD;
ginia indulged during the long tearless hours of anguish&#xD;
that she sat brooding over the gossip of the old ci~one,&#xD;
who had sent a death-stab to her heart with her cm~el&#xD;
words.&#xD;
And this is not an isolated case, for Sout iern women&#xD;
talk too much to servants; and many homes have been&#xD;
made wretched by the tattle of negro confidants, where&#xD;
no real cause existed foil unhappiness. In the ignorance&#xD;
and moral degradation, and in the ~attering manner with&#xD;
which, their slanders are received, during the interval&#xD;
that the dignity of mistress is laid aside for that of coin-&#xD;
pai~ion, may be found an excuse for the conduct of these&#xD;
poor, unenlio'htencd creatures. But what apology can be&#xD;
offered for those men and women, who, being made in&#xD;
God's image, go about retailing scandal as the pastime of&#xD;
intellectual and accountable beings? We fear there is a&#xD;

140                  DESAIZ&#xD;
terrible retribution in store for them; and it would at least&#xD;
be well for them to ~anse in their misspent career, and&#xD;
consider: What benefit can come from this discourse?&#xD;
Does it elevate? Is it charitable? Is not gossiping the&#xD;
twin sister of lying? Does it leave the conscience at&#xD;
ease? iDoes it not degrade whoever indulges in it?&#xD;
But while we have been asking these questions, for&#xD;
winch we ask .a sober reflection, th~ husband has made a&#xD;
triumphant speech, the wife has been changed from a&#xD;
loving, hopeful woman into a Niobe, and now dinner is&#xD;
announced to both. Neither eat, but from what different&#xD;
causes! In truth Virginia did not hear the servant who&#xD;
told her dinner was ready, neither did she notice her&#xD;
when she brought tl~e meal to her room. And thus she&#xD;
sat in silent, tearless agony, while the hours went by and&#xD;
the sun went down, and until the silver beams of a new&#xD;
moon fell across her folded hands and reminded her that&#xD;
her husband might soon be home. Not wishing him to&#xD;
see any traces of suffering, she arose, and putting the&#xD;
cruel letters away, made a fresh toilette with unusual&#xD;
care, and went down on the gallery to await his corn iug.&#xD;
But during those long hours of crucifixion her plans for&#xD;
the future were made, and sti'aight tb the bitter end the&#xD;
innocent and injured wife would walk with the unIlinch~&#xD;
ing spirit of a martyr who felt proud to die in the cause&#xD;
espoused. Thus, instead of dwelling upon her own griefs&#xD;
and disappointinent~insteacl of cherishing hatred for her&#xD;
rival, ahd resentment for her husband, she only reinem-&#xD;
bored how cruel was the destiny that had forced him to&#xD;
marry for money instead of love; and there was nothing&#xD;
but pity an&amp;amp; sympathy in her heart for the two unhappy&#xD;
creatures whom man's inhumanity had forever separated.&#xD;
&#xD;
3)E5PAIR.                141&#xD;
Then, resolving to men ion to no human being the fatal&#xD;
news which had blasted h~' happiness forever, she deter~&#xD;
mined to be gentle and tender to her husband, and, in&#xD;
addition, to do all for him that money could do. Instead&#xD;
of chiding, she would, try and save him, for it was pow&#xD;
evident to her that he was fast becoming a slave to hi~&#xD;
cups, and without a speedy reform could be effected, it&#xD;
w~uld be too late. Naturally delicate, she felt that the&#xD;
shock of the morning would soon wear her silently away,&#xD;
and loving her husband more than herself, she cared not&#xD;
how soon the end might come; for then, with her fortune,&#xD;
he might wed the woman of his heart, and two souls would&#xD;
then beAiappy, where three were now so wretched. This&#xD;
is not unnatural, but only uncommon; for some few&#xD;
women have lived who were capable of just such self-&#xD;
abnc~atiOn, and who possessed the martyr-like spirit here&#xD;
embodied in the character of poor Virginia. With these&#xD;
thoughts in her mind, she went below stairs and. met&#xD;
Judge Baker as he entered the front door.&#xD;
"Where is Clifford?" was her eager answer to his&#xD;
"I left him down town. He will be rip soon-or at&#xD;
least he said he would," was the doubtful reply; and the&#xD;
laces of both speaker and listener betrayed the anxiety&#xD;
which they felt. Then, with too much wifely pride to&#xD;
betray her real feelings, even in that presence, she com-&#xD;
manded herself and said:&#xD;
"how passed the day?"&#xD;
"Triumphantly for Clifford, and if we can only keep him&#xD;
straight for the next two months, his election is certain."&#xD;
"What do you mean?" asked Virginia, with the quick&#xD;
resentment of a wife.&#xD;

DESPAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"AMy poor child, do not be offended , for I love Cijiford&#xD;
as if he were my own son; but lately he drinks too much,&#xD;
and I beg you, if you. have any influence over him, to&#xD;
urge him to stop, for if he continues to drink as lie has&#xD;
been doing for several months, it will ruin him forever."&#xD;
"ff1 have any influence?" said the poor wife. There&#xD;
it was again! A fresh stab! Well, she couldn't expect&#xD;
anything else, and gliding out of the house, she walked&#xD;
down to the front gate, and leaning sadly upon it, watched&#xD;
for the coming of her husband. Scarce twelve hours be-&#xD;
fore had seen her stam~ding in the same spot, a happy&#xD;
wife; now she was a betrayed woman, an outcast, a&#xD;
wanderer through the dark valley of Despair, with no&#xD;
hope to cheer, nq beacon-light to guide.&#xD;
The twilight deepened, the sky became ihky black;&#xD;
but still she kept her silent vigil and peered into the un-&#xD;
fathomable darkness for the form which came not. It&#xD;
lightened, it thundered, and from the masses of black&#xD;
clouds a storm burst upon her uncovered head; but nothing&#xD;
daunted, she held her post, and still-he came not. Then,&#xD;
through the terror of the darkness, a strong arm was folded&#xD;
lovingly around her, and her uncle s~aid in a kindly tone:&#xD;
"Come in, Virginia. Your watching will not bring&#xD;
him;" and without any resistance lie led her to the house&#xD;
and into her own room, where she sank down, with her&#xD;
drenched clothing clinging around her. Conscious of&#xD;
nothing but a dull, heavy pain in her heart, she did not&#xD;
know that the night was gone, until the first faint glim-&#xD;
iner of day-dawn was followed by the entrance of a pale&#xD;
and haggard man. There were no exclamations, no tears,&#xD;
nothing unusual; but extending her hand, she said in her&#xD;
softest and sweetest voice:&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am so glad you have come, Clifford! See, I have&#xD;
waited for you all night."&#xD;
The kind words touched his sensitive heart, and press..&#xD;
ing her hand, he sank upon the floor by her side, and bury.&#xD;
ing his head in her lap, said:&#xD;
"Forgive me 1"&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
A MOTHERS 5 HEART.&#xD;
HE dower~xvhichi Virginia Dearing had brought&#xD;
to her husband, and which her father generously&#xD;
gave into the sole keeping of his son-in-law, was&#xD;
munificent beyond expectation. Secretly transferred to&#xD;
the proprietor of the "Manor," it saved that ancient es-&#xD;
tate, besides liquidating some other pressing debts; there-&#xD;
by causing the Hon. Mr. Troup to look the world&#xD;
haughtily, if not squarely, in the face once more, and&#xD;
again to bid defiance to that fate in which he believed&#xD;
more implicitly than in his God. Thus, instead of feel-&#xD;
ing thankful for the timely aid which saved his home and&#xD;
extricated him from dishonor, in stead of beginning a life&#xD;
of reform, he triumphed in what he was pleased to call&#xD;
his '~ Wonderful management," and again renewed the&#xD;
old system of extravagance and effeminate luxury, with-&#xD;
out giving a thought as to when or how these new debts&#xD;
would be met. His expenditures were reckless beyond&#xD;
description, and served to verify one of Thackeray's many&#xD;
truisms, when he says: "people never live half so well,&#xD;
as when they are comfortably in debt." So flattering him-&#xD;
self that he was a man of destiny, and confident that fate&#xD;
would take care of her favored child, he cared nothing&#xD;
for the future, so the present gratified his boundless de-&#xD;
sires. lie forgot that his own flesh, had been tortured,&#xD;
Lis own blood spilled to satisfy the tyrannical demands of&#xD;
his pride, for in his thoughts there was room for nothing&#xD;

else but Self. Or if he remembered his son at all, it was&#xD;
with a sneer for his weakness, and a hope that he would&#xD;
soon be 'cured of his boyish folly. Thus, can love of&#xD;
money and self-indulgence not only dwarf and distort&#xD;
man's better' nature, but it can obliterate and deaden&#xD;
even the ties qf consanguinity.&#xD;
how different with the mother!!! No amount of&#xD;
money can stifle her affections; and instead of gratifying&#xD;
those inordinate desires which ar.e born of selfishness, she&#xD;
is always thinking, "What can I do without?" And&#xD;
whatever it is, the value of that self-denial willie cheer-&#xD;
fully given to those loved ones whom she has borne&#xD;
and nurtured. The thought, "What can my children do&#xD;
for me?" rarely suggests itself to the mother, but it's al-&#xD;
ways," What can I do for my children?" and in thinking&#xD;
of her boy,. Mrs. Troup felt that she would gladly give&#xD;
home, friends, position, everything to make him happy.&#xD;
Before his marriage, he used to write herregularly once&#xD;
a week, and his letters were so full of hope that the read-&#xD;
ing was like taking a fresh lease on life. Afterwards.&#xD;
though, at long intervals, caine some short, cold, and un-&#xD;
satisfactory notes; and at length these were succeeded by&#xD;
a silence which was cruel in the child and hard for the&#xD;
mother to bear.&#xD;
From gossiping tongues the news of Clifford's excesses&#xD;
reached the family servants, and through them the re-&#xD;
ports became knowi~ to the agonized mother. He was&#xD;
the subject of her thoughts and prayers by ~ay and night,&#xD;
and her heart went out to him in one great throb of sym-&#xD;
pathy, for she knew only too well what was driving him&#xD;
to such recklessness. But, alas! what could she do?&#xD;
She was powerless-she could do nothing except to give&#xD;

him her love and her prayers, and these she gave without&#xD;
reserve. His conduct wounded her pride; but, mother~&#xD;
like,, the lower he sank in the esteem of the world, the&#xD;
more lie was deserted by friends, the more closely her&#xD;
heart-tendrils entwined around him, for a iiiother never&#xD;
forsakes. Then, while a mother's heart is so unchanging,&#xD;
it seems cruel that children should forget her claims, and&#xD;
return her unwavering devotion with neglect and in if-&#xD;
ference. In this respect Clifford was not unlike many&#xD;
others; and although in his heart he adored his mother,&#xD;
in his conduct he shamefully disregarded her claims upon&#xD;
him, thus filling her each day with new anxiety, and giv-&#xD;
ing fresh pain where it would have been merciful to pre-&#xD;
vent it. This is not right; and if we could only remem-&#xD;
ber how our mother cared for us during infancy; how&#xD;
tenderly she watched us during the silent hours of the&#xD;
night, when every other eye was closed in sleep; how she&#xD;
laughed in our joy, and mourned in our grief; how from,&#xD;
childhooA to manhood her devotion never faltered; how&#xD;
from the cradle to the grave she is the one friend who is&#xD;
true as Heaven-we would pause before giving her one&#xD;
moment's pain. From that evening, when Clifford knelt&#xD;
in. the twilight at his mother's feet, and said in despaii~:&#xD;
"Mother, pray for me," there had been a dull, leaden&#xD;
weight about her heart, which nothing had the power to&#xD;
lift. She had grown thinner, her cheeks were paler, and&#xD;
her hair had suddenly become gray. But with mother,&#xD;
~s with son, it was not so much a regret that he was mar-&#xD;
ried to the lovely Virginia as it was a regret for the mo-&#xD;
tive; and to this womanly woman, as to her manly son,&#xD;
came the ever-recurring thought of a deep injury done an&#xD;
innocent girl.&#xD;

&#xD;
But while the mother's heart ached sadly for her boy,&#xD;
the father, wrapped in his own selfishness, was rearing&#xD;
new gods to worship, and devising endless means of en-&#xD;
joying this life to its fullest extent.&#xD;
And yet there was nothing mean or little in this man's&#xD;
nature. He didn't even know he was selfish. Do any of&#xD;
us ever know this, or acknowledge it? Xo ~ he was the&#xD;
victim of. weakness and frailty, which made him substi-&#xD;
tute pride for paternal love, and expediency for duty, un-&#xD;
til he had now but two ideas-the one was to keep the&#xD;
name of Troup up to its proud old standard, the other&#xD;
was to save the "Manor," let it cost what it would.,&#xD;

Mr. Hall was immersed in politics, Congressional re-&#xD;

bring, and withdrawing' as soon as Mr. Hall had ques-&#xD;
tioned him ~upon his studies; while Gertrude was trying&#xD;
hard to forget by assisting about the household duties,&#xD;
and by devoting a portion of her time to the reading and&#xD;
exercise which her uncle's wisdom had suggested.&#xD;
Mr. Hall missed the gay society of his young student,&#xD;
and still entertained a faint hope that he might yet be his&#xD;
nephew one day; but miot believing, as some others fool-&#xD;
ishly do, that women can be reasoned into loving whom-&#xD;
soever their grand-pareimts, parents, uncles, aunts, or other&#xD;
relatives think it wise and prudent for them to marry,&#xD;
he discreetly said nothing. I&#xD;
my not having married, may I ask if you expect to live&#xD;
"And pray, Gertrude~ since you are so concerned about&#xD;
single all the days of your life?" for they were Qn the&#xD;
subject of matrimoi~y again, and Gertrude, as usual, was&#xD;
teasing her uncle about being an old bachelor.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why not?" she said archly, and smiling in the ear..&#xD;
iiest, pale face of him whose deep black eyes regarded&#xD;
her seriously.&#xD;
"There are some good reasons 'why not,'" he answered&#xD;
gravely; "and now, laying all sentimentality and foolish-&#xD;
ness aside, since we are on this subject, let us have a sensi-&#xD;
ble, practical talk."&#xD;
"Agreed, uncle," said the bewitching girl, who had com-&#xD;
pletely captivated the old man's heart; and sitting orr a&#xD;
stool at his feet, she added, with a pretty pout of the lips:&#xD;
"only I hate to listen to sermons on week-days, they seem&#xD;
so out of place."&#xD;
"You naughty girl," he said, smiling.&#xD;
"But come, what are the reasons?" she asked, at the&#xD;
same time looking down to hide the mischievous smile&#xD;
which she felt was at least disrespectful to one whom&#xD;
she well knew had only her good and happiness at&#xD;
heart..&#xD;
"First of all, then, your mother is your only protector,&#xD;
and according to the laws of nature it is reasonable to&#xD;
suppose you will survive her. If you do outlive her&#xD;
"Oh, uncle," she said, in a tone of distress,, then&#xD;
bowed her head upon his knee. Stroking her hair, lie re-&#xD;
peated, slowly and solemnly:&#xD;
"If you outlive her, to whom will you look for love&#xD;
and protection?"&#xD;
"To you, uncle," she answered, while her beautiful face&#xD;
was contracted with pain.&#xD;
"To me, certainly, if I am living; but, m dear child, I&#xD;
am a slender thread to cling to, for, as you kpow, I am&#xD;
only a wreck, and the probabilities are that~ you will long&#xD;
outlive me."&#xD;
&#xD;
148                 WHY NOT?&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8257-00000075"/>&#xD;
150                 wn~ NOT?                                                     WILY NOT?                 151&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, uncle, do you want to kill me?" she now asked,&#xD;
while* her eyes were swimming in tears.&#xD;
"No, my child, no. On the contrary, I want to pre-&#xD;
pare you to live the life that is before you. I want to&#xD;
make you understand that when one resource fails there&#xD;
are others to take its place. I want to teach you to bat-&#xD;
tle with fate, instead of yielding to it. Do you know&#xD;
what I would like you to do?"&#xD;
"What?" was the eager response.&#xD;
"Marry some sober, honest, energetic, and intelligent&#xD;
young man, who would take 'good care of you."&#xD;
The suggestion was received without comment, and they&#xD;
lapsed into silence. After some little time, the uncle&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"What do you think of it, Gertrude?"&#xD;
With a sigh, and looking down, she said: "I cannot&#xD;
doubt your motives, uncle, but you surely would not have&#xD;
me marry just for the sake of marrying."&#xD;
"You would not have me marry a man unless I loved&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
Evading her question, and perhaps as much for the sake&#xD;
of argument as for the purposing of discovering her real&#xD;
feelings, he said:&#xD;
"Did it never strike you that this feeling called Love,&#xD;
is a thing of the will?"&#xD;
"Never!"&#xD;
"Nor that it is an ideal thing?"&#xD;
"It surely is, not tangible, but it is powerful!" was&#xD;
the earnest reply.&#xD;
- - "Well now, my child, let us reason a little on the sub-&#xD;
ject. In your calmer moments, when passion and j udg.&#xD;
&#xD;
ment are equally balanced, you will acknowledge that no&#xD;
man possesses the god-like attributes with which a&#xD;
Woman's love endows him. Do you admit this?"&#xD;
"I suppose I must," was the reluctant answer.&#xD;
"Well, then, upon a close analysis of the emotions, per-&#xD;
sons in love will find that 'they are worshipping an ideal&#xD;
that exists only in the imagination, instead of a living,&#xD;
breathing reality. See, if you admit the first proposition&#xD;
you must admit the second. Then, why not say to your&#xD;
will, 'Ii will love this or that man;' bring your imagina-&#xD;
tion into play, and the thing is done."&#xD;
"Oh, uncle," said Gertrude impatiently. "You reason&#xD;
upon a subject of which you know nothing! You have&#xD;
never been in love! If you had, you would know how&#xD;
powerless one is when under the influence of what you&#xD;
call an ideal emotion. You would know too what bliss&#xD;
and what despair it can bring, and how it persecutes the&#xD;
victim it holds within its grasp;" and as a flood of emo-&#xD;
tipus swept over the chords of her soul, she bowed her&#xD;
head upon his knee and wept.&#xD;
"Oh, my child, my child! Is this the way you for-&#xD;
get?" and hopeless as the task seemed of making her&#xD;
bury her idol, Mr. Hall did not despair, for he believed a&#xD;
strong will could conquer any feeling, and more espec-&#xD;
ially if one can be made to realize that honor demands&#xD;
the sacrifice. This he hoped to impress upqn Gertrude,&#xD;
and indeed he had already done so; but ~t times the old&#xD;
love came back with such force, as to submerge all new&#xD;
resolutions, and send both her will and honor drifting out&#xD;
to sea, without chart or compass to guide.&#xD;
Raising l~er head after awhile, and looking right into&#xD;
her tear-staihed eyes, Mr. Hall said:&#xD;

"My child, I have only been talking, just for the sake&#xD;
of argument,.,~and for the purpose of getting at ybur real&#xD;
feelings, for there's no man living WhQ appreciates more&#xD;
thoroughly than I do, that love must spring from congen~&#xD;
iahty of tastes and temperament, and that it is ndt a thing&#xD;
of the will. And again, when you say that I 'reason&#xD;
upon a subject of which I know nothing, and that I have&#xD;
never been in love,' let me assure you that you talk upon&#xD;
a subject of which you know nothing, for no man has&#xD;
ever loved more devotedly, yet more hopelessly, than I&#xD;
have. Let this knowledge be a consolation to you;" and&#xD;
with a deep sigh he drew her to his knee, and, folded her&#xD;
in his arms.&#xD;
So, the man whom the world thought without feeling,&#xD;
shad been in love; the man whom the world thought utterly&#xD;
indifferent to women; bound his wound in secret, and,,&#xD;
Portia-like, endured in silence.&#xD;
"This is not to be spoken of, though," he said, as she&#xD;
hid her head upon his shoulder and wept; "and II onl&#xD;
told it to you to show you that you are not the only y&#xD;
one&#xD;
who has loved and lost. Come, now, don'i cry any more;&#xD;
for it pains me to see tears in. your eyed;" and arising, he&#xD;
kissed her brow and entered 'his "Study," while she stole&#xD;
quietly to her room, to wrestle with her memory, her&#xD;
heart, and her will.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
A TRUE WIFE.&#xD;
OT a murmt~r, not a complaint, no reproaches,&#xD;
nothing but kind words~ ever came from the lips&#xD;
of "Virginia for her husband; for she was con~&#xD;
evinced that if kindness failed to reform him, harshness&#xD;
would be still more unavailing. And now that she knew&#xD;
the secrets of his heart, a tender sympathy was added to&#xD;
her love, and she appreciated that he needed encourage~&#xD;
ment rather than censure. That she did not upbraid him&#xD;
may seem strange to some, and her charity may possibly&#xD;
call forth sneers from others; for the greatest of all the&#xD;
virtues, according to St. Paul's idea, is regarded by men&#xD;
as cowardice and want of spirit.&#xD;
Virginia was ind endent, though,~ of either the ap-&#xD;
proval or disapproval of the world; for having sufficient&#xD;
moral courage ~to do right for right's sake, and being sus~&#xD;
tamed by that help from on high for which she daily&#xD;
prayed, it was not tiossible for any human power to swerve&#xD;
her from her purpose.&#xD;
She was a wife, and remembering this, she determined&#xD;
to do her dnty, no matter if her husband failed to do his.&#xD;
She married him in good faith and because she loved&#xD;
him, and the fact that he married h~r from mercenary&#xD;
motives did n6t lessen or relieve any,' of her obligations.&#xD;
She did not care for the moneybnt the fact that he loved&#xD;
another pierced her heart like a poisoned dart; and yet&#xD;

(&#xD;
&#xD;
154.&#xD;
&#xD;
A TRUE WIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
she was brave enough and. strong enough to lock this Un-.&#xD;
fortunate secret in her own bosom, and to walk boldly&#xD;
forward. in the discharge of her wifely duties. The&#xD;
story had been divulged to her in an underhand way,&#xD;
but her resolution to keep her husband from suspecting&#xD;
that she knew it, was firm, although her heart should&#xD;
break in the attempt. This was a brave determination,&#xD;
and perhaps martyrs have gone to the stake with less*&#xD;
heroism than the fuhilment of this pledge required. She&#xD;
was unselfish, and in the possession of this transcendent&#xD;
virtue was to be found the motive which prompted her&#xD;
not to allude, either by word or act, to the unhappiness&#xD;
which her husband coulcbiio longer conceal from her&#xD;
watchful eyes. Such self-~acrifice will not be appreciated&#xD;
'by many, for it is a natu~'al delusion of man to think&#xD;
every one happy but himself, and when the shadows&#xD;
come, to fancy all others luxuriating~ in the sunshine.&#xD;
With the insight of a woman and a wife, Virginia felt&#xD;
that she was not necessary to her husband's happiness&#xD;
long before the fatal secret was revealed to her and had&#xD;
the cause been anything less than love for another, per-&#xD;
haps she would not have had so much charity for the&#xD;
man whom she idolized. Fully appreciating* that that&#xD;
was a feeling which cannot and will not be controlled, her&#xD;
heart was f till of sympathy for him who was the victim&#xD;
of a combination of circumstances which were beyond his&#xD;
control.&#xD;
For a little while succeeding the morning when he&#xD;
Lknelt at her feet and wept some contrite tears, Virginia&#xD;
had strong hopes of a permanent reformation in her htis-&#xD;
band; but the demon which rankled in his bosom again&#xD;
&#xD;
155&#xD;
&#xD;
A TRUE WIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
drove him to excesses, with its harrowing memories and&#xD;
torturing accusations. Thus will men ever find excuses&#xD;
for dissipation, and although acknowledging its ruinous&#xD;
effects, will not struggle to be released from its fiendish&#xD;
bondage. Clifford was punctiliouS to a fault in all out-&#xD;
ward attentions to his gentle, uncomplaining little wife&#xD;
but, as we have before remarked, in those nameless acts&#xD;
-those delightful nothings which love alone suggests,&#xD;
he was a stranger. And because Virginia did not seem&#xD;
to feel slighted, he thought she was satisfied. Many hus-&#xD;
bands think the same, when, if they could look into the&#xD;
hearts of their wives, they would see how yearningly they&#xD;
were throbbing for love-words and acts of tenderness.&#xD;
Clifford was not insensible to his wife's kindness and&#xD;
thoughtfulness, and sometimes, when it grated upon him,#&#xD;
he would say:&#xD;
"I am not worthy of so much kindness, Virginia;"&#xD;
and then, when she would answer: "Yes, Clifford, yo~.&#xD;
are, for I love you," he would shrink away from her and&#xD;
say to himself:&#xD;
"Oh, God! if she didn't love me, this, life of deceit&#xD;
wouldn't be so hard to bear."&#xD;
Then, after a few words like these, they would relapse'&#xD;
into the silence which inevitably fell upon them as soon&#xD;
as they were alone. Feeling it a duty to be at home&#xD;
sometimes, Clifford, would occasionally remain in the&#xD;
evening and attempt to while away the time by reading&#xD;
to his wife. Soon growing weary of this, and restive&#xD;
under the loving glances of her soft blue eyes, he would&#xD;
fly from the house in sheer desperation, and joining some&#xD;
gay companions, would go to "The Evergla~es,~' or some&#xD;

looking up.&#xD;

"Because I am not satisfied here, sir, an&#xD;

&#xD;
GOING AWAY..              159k&#xD;
&#xD;
"And you go immediately?"&#xD;
"At once.'~&#xD;
"Is your mother willing?"&#xD;
"I have only intimated it to her, sir."&#xD;
"And what did she say?"&#xD;
"She opposed it."&#xD;
"And you still persist in going?"&#xD;
"That is my present intention, sir."&#xD;
"You will allow me~ then, I hope, as one of your&#xD;
father's best friends as well as your own, to enter my&#xD;
protest against the movement, and to remind you of some&#xD;
duties of which you ~o not seem to think."&#xD;
"Certainly, sir 1"&#xD;
"In the first place, then, I think you owe it to your&#xD;
widowed mother, as her oldest son, to stay with and pro-.&#xD;
tect her; and in the second place, you -~owe it to your&#xD;
Dative State to remain within her borders, to work for hor&#xD;
good, rather than to go in search of strange lands to serve.&#xD;
and new gods to~f6llow after. What do you say now?"&#xD;
"I think ~your views are correct, sir, and under more&#xD;
auspicious circumstances they would be mine. But I am&#xD;
not happy here, and I fancy, when surrounded by new&#xD;
scenes, I may be more contented."&#xD;
"Not happy? What have you been doing? for as&#xD;
Victor Hugo rightly says, 'our acts make or mar ~&#xD;
"I fear this is an exceptional case, sir, for really I have&#xD;
been doing nothing very bad."&#xD;
"No man ever did, by his own consent. But tell me,&#xD;
what makes you unhappy, and why this sudden 'decision?&#xD;
Come, you have no secrets from me, or at least should&#xD;
not have."&#xD;
"That is true, sir, and I do not wish to have."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Own. up like a man then, and tell me what is the&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
"Sirtce yo~i flatter me by asking my confidence, sir I&#xD;
will tell you that II love your niece, and that her rejection&#xD;
of me has made. this place intolerable."&#xD;
"And is it for a girl that you are going to abandon,~&#xD;
State, home, friends, and family?"&#xD;
"Doubtless you consider me very weak, sir, and I may&#xD;
be, but this affair has made me so unhappy that I can&#xD;
neither study nor be at rest here any more."&#xD;
Seeing that his young friend was in earnest, and with&#xD;
the hope of driving him from his purpose, Mr~ Hall's&#xD;
usual sagacity suggested at once what course was best to&#xD;
pursue, as he said:&#xD;
"How often have you courted the young lady?"&#xD;
"Once, sir.&#xD;
"Once? only once? Why, you don't deserve to suc-&#xD;
ceed! Court her forty times, and if need be, an hundred&#xD;
and ~forty tim~s; always bearing in mind the motto:&#xD;
'Faint heart ne'er won fair lady.' Was the world made&#xD;
in a day? ~Suppose you had read only one page of&#xD;
l3lackstone, would you now be ready to be admitted to&#xD;
the bar? Abandon your Western trip, lay siege to this&#xD;
young lady's heart, and by your hope of success, never&#xD;
lay down your arms, until you have carried the citadel!&#xD;
Once t. Why, that child's play!. Doii't you know that&#xD;
wol nen love to be coaxed and begged and petted?'&#xD;
~ Excuse me, sir,-I should have sought your advice&#xD;
before, but I. did not dream you were so well posted in&#xD;
regard to a class whom you so entirely ignore."&#xD;
"But Ii haven't gone through life with my eyes closed,&#xD;

&#xD;
so many men, both single~and married, that I might as&#xD;
well have had all sorts of love-scrapes and been mar-.&#xD;
ned myself. And besides, who says that 1 ignore the&#xD;
fair sex? It is not true, for although I have never&#xD;
married, they have no warmer admirer than myself, and&#xD;
the older I grow, the more convinced I am that all men&#xD;
should marry. It is a duty they owe their country, not&#xD;
less than themselves, for there comes a time when the&#xD;
State no longer needs them, and then only can they find&#xD;
comfort and happiness in the retirement of hom6~ An-&#xD;
other reason is, that marriage is right according to our&#xD;
religion, and should be the normal condition of man.&#xD;
As a 'promoter of virtue the institution should be en-&#xD;
couraged, and my advice to all young men is to get&#xD;
married."&#xD;
"But suppose you can't?" asked Paul, Whose face had&#xD;
brightened, and Whose heart had taken fresh hope at the&#xD;
Words of his revered mentor.&#xD;
"Oh, but you can! Now, let me tell you something'?&#xD;
You have taken your books hom\e-.-bning them back and&#xD;
study here as you did before. Call upon Gertrude, send&#xD;
her flowers, books, music, papers, fruit, anything. Be&#xD;
cheerful, and let her see that you do not intend to die,&#xD;
even if she did discard. you, and my Word for it, you will&#xD;
notice a difference in less than a week. Walk With her,&#xD;
ride with l~er, tell her* you are going away, but don't&#xD;
mention lov~e to her; and the first thing you know, you.&#xD;
will become necessary to her: this you Will find out, and&#xD;
when the proper time comes, you will make the assault."&#xD;
"Agreed I" said Paul, arising and grasping the hand of&#xD;
his friend.&#xD;
"Go now and 2get your books, for I've wasted as much&#xD;
&#xD;
time upon you and your sweetheart as I can to-day."&#xD;
And taking up his paper he resumed the reading of it,&#xD;
while Paul xV~ent whistling across the lawn, with eyes for&#xD;
no one, ears for nothing, when suddenly a familiar voice&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"You are in a happy mood this morning."&#xD;
"Why, Miss Gertrude! Where in the world did you.&#xD;
come from? Did you drop down from the skies?" and&#xD;
he shook hands with his beautiful vis-d-vis.&#xD;
"No, I came from a walk in the woods. But what&#xD;
makes you so joyous?"&#xD;
"A conversation with your uncle, for really I should&#xD;
feel anything but joyous."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"Because I am going away soon, perhaps never to re-&#xD;
turn ;" and he watched her closely to see what effect this&#xD;
little ruse would have.&#xD;
With surprise in her face, and nothing more, she said:&#xD;
"I'm sorry i~ hear it, for my uncle will miss you."&#xD;
Simple words, and spoken without any intention to&#xD;
wound, but they fell upon Paul's heart like a well-direct-&#xD;
ed blow aimed by a premeditated hand.&#xD;
"I shall feel flattered if he doe~," was the cool reply,&#xD;
and with a "good-morning," he passed on. But his face,&#xD;
that was a moment before so beaming, was now clouded;&#xD;
there was an absolute pain in. his heart, as he despaired of&#xD;
ever winning her he loved, and for days her words&#xD;
sounded like a dirge in his ears.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
WEARING!&#xD;
HE buoyancy and hope of a few months ago 310&#xD;
,longer stimulated Clifford to action; his ambi-&#xD;
tion was dead, his duties were attended to after&#xD;
a fashion, and thus another noble life was being added to&#xD;
the victims of the cup. The life waA telling upon him,&#xD;
for the bright blue eyes of other days were heavy and&#xD;
bloodshot, his cheeks flushed and bloated, his manner&#xD;
impatient and restless, his words hasty, and latterly inter-&#xD;
spersed with profanity-something which in former days&#xD;
had been a stranger to his lips. This is not surprising,&#xD;
for it is the work of the poison which lie daily imbibed&#xD;
to degrade, and as he sank lower and deeper and more&#xD;
surely, so will every mau go downward who gratifies this&#xD;
low appetite at the sacrifice of reason and of self-respect.&#xD;
&amp;amp; the wretched days went by, and thinking only of him-&#xD;
self, he failed to discover that some secret cause was&#xD;
preying upon the health of his wife, and,, wearing her&#xD;
young life away. He did not notice that her step was&#xD;
languid, or that she was pale and thin, or that even as-&#xD;
cending the steps quite took away her breath. Oh, no!&#xD;
these are such, little things, and then-she never coin-&#xD;
plained. Had she have, told her husband that she was&#xD;
ill or suffering, no man would have been more ready&#xD;
with words of sympathy, no man would have sought&#xD;
medical skill more quickly. But it is this very blindness,&#xD;
&#xD;
this cruel neglect, that makes wives endure in silence, and&#xD;
that, ~at last, places them beyond the need of watchful&#xD;
eyes or loving words. No matter how they keep up, no&#xD;
matter how cheerful they seem or how uncomplaining&#xD;
they arc, the disease is in the heart, it is wearing away the&#xD;
life-blood drop by drop, and nothing but love and kind-&#xD;
ness can stanch, the crimson streaih. Oh, husbands I is&#xD;
she whom you call by the sacred name of wife sick-is&#xD;
the mother of your children lonely-do you absent your-&#xD;
self day and night from home? Does a sickly pallor now&#xD;
take the place of roses in her cheeks-is her merry laugh&#xD;
changed into a sigh-is her light step blow and weary?&#xD;
If so, recall, the day when you bore her from her father's&#xD;
house a blushing bride; think of those times when you&#xD;
told her how dear she was to you; go to her, comfort and&#xD;
cheer her, be to her what you voluntarily promised to&#xD;
be in those love-days that are gone; and in the evening&#xD;
of life, remorse will not be added to the long list of&#xD;
neglected duties which shall blast your peace of mind&#xD;
with their painful ~recollections. No matter from what&#xD;
motives men marry, there is no law, real or imagined,&#xD;
that exempts them from the performance of certain&#xD;
duties which the marriage relation imposes; and try as lie&#xD;
did, Clifford w~s not sophist enough to reason himself&#xD;
into this way of thinking, or to reconcile himself into&#xD;
believing that his continual neglect of his wife was right.&#xD;
Then he attempted to quiet his conscience by fancying&#xD;
his conduct must be above reproach, as she 'found no&#xD;
fault, and even tried to make himself believe that she&#xD;
neither cared for nor desired any demonstrations of love&#xD;
on his part.&#xD;
however, the feeling that he had injured her was fast&#xD;

v        164                  WEARING.                                                   WEARII~1G.&#xD;
&#xD;
wearing away, for under the corrupting influence of&#xD;
liquor 'his better impulses were yielding to the bad, and&#xD;
the latter readily excused any omission and sanctioned&#xD;
any neglect. So, day by day, two lives were being&#xD;
wasted, two hearts were wearing away, but to each other&#xD;
the causes would be "nameless evermore."&#xD;
Clifford now had an additional grievance, and it arose&#xD;
'from the fact that his father was making fresh demands&#xD;
upon him for more money. The thousands that had been&#xD;
furnished him had gone, no one knew whither, and the&#xD;
fact that~, his father was again upon the verge of bank-&#xD;
ruptcy, and that he again called upon him to save him,&#xD;
drove Clifford almost to suicide. What to do he knew&#xD;
not, for rather than go to his wife or her father for&#xD;
money, he would die.&#xD;
One evening, while this new trouble was heavy upon&#xD;
him, instead of going down town as usual he went up to&#xD;
their room with his wife. Folding his hands behind him,&#xD;
he walked slowly back and forth the room, with his ?yes&#xD;
bent upon the floor. Virginia took up a book, but it was&#xD;
not to read, for her heart Was full of forebodings, and&#xD;
her watchful eyes followed her husband in the hope of&#xD;
divining his secret grief&#xD;
At length, seating himself at the table, he took up a&#xD;
book also, when his wife, iiio longer able to endure the&#xD;
silence, leaned upon his knee, and said, with tender&#xD;
anxiety:&#xD;
"Clifford, what is the matter with you ~"&#xD;
"Nothing," he said, indifferently, without raising his&#xD;
eyes fron~ the page.&#xD;
Natui'ally timid and shrinking, she was now ~mbold.&#xD;
&#xD;
ened by the hope of alleviating her husband's troubles,&#xD;
and said, again:&#xD;
"It grieves me, Clifford, to think that you do not confide&#xD;
in me, that you never talk to me; and it; is killing me to&#xD;
see that I am just nothing to you;" and here the over-&#xD;
charged heart poured forth its long and silent struggles&#xD;
in tears. The words came from her without any will Qf&#xD;
her own; they were wrung from her by suffering. She&#xD;
regretted them, for she had intended going down to the&#xD;
grave without giving him a hint of how deeply she felt&#xD;
his neglect.&#xD;
"Virginia!" came in surprise from Clifford's lips, and&#xD;
folding her in his arms for the first time in many months,&#xD;
a fresh reproach added its harrowing sting to many&#xD;
others; for~ until that moment he believed his wife to be&#xD;
as indifferent to his attentions as she seemed.&#xD;
So little do husbands know of their wives!&#xD;
While she lay weeping in his arms, he said:&#xD;
"Forgive me, Virginia; but really I have nothing to&#xD;
tell."&#xD;
Nothing to tell! nothing to say to her who should&#xD;
share his every thought! What a reflection upon the&#xD;
sacred relation they bore each other: aud yet how often&#xD;
doss it happen!&#xD;
Let husbands look to their firesiaes; let them remem~&#xD;
her that they have the world for society, ~ut their wh~es&#xD;
have only them. Let the attentions of the honeymoon&#xD;
be extended into the years that are to come; for as the&#xD;
cares of life multiply, as the delicate constitution yield~i&#xD;
to the shock of mimotherhood, as the roses fado from her~&#xD;
cheeks, she will need your love, your tenderness, move&#xD;
tha~i ever she did in the gladsomne days of happy youth.&#xD;

Then ~he had admirers by the score; then she had fathers&#xD;
mother, sisters, brothers, home; now she has but you.&#xD;
Don't forget it; but when your eye falls upon this&#xD;
page, if there are duties left undone, if your heart smites&#xD;
you, don't let your pride keep you from doing a simple&#xD;
act of justice; but go to your wife, show her these lines;&#xD;
there's no need to say a wo~'d; but press her to your&#xD;
heart, kiss her-she will understand-then go your way,&#xD;
and try and be a better and more attentive husband.&#xD;
4nd if you should not love her-God forgive you if&#xD;
you have injured her to this extent-be * more mindful&#xD;
than ever, and try to let your acts of tenderness supply&#xD;
the deficiency in your heart.&#xD;
For some time the sobs of the young wife alone broke&#xD;
the silence, and they cut deeper and deeper into Clif-&#xD;
ford's heart each moment ; for in his soul he abhorred&#xD;
himself for what he had done. Wretch enough to die,&#xD;
and not knowing what to say, he sat holding his stricken&#xD;
wife in silent agony.&#xD;
Then, when the first storm of grief had subsided, she&#xD;
raised her head, and said, with such composure as she was&#xD;
able to command:&#xD;
"Pardon me, Clifford, but I saw something troubled you,&#xD;
and I thought I could help you; I hoped, at least, you&#xD;
would not refuse my sympathy."&#xD;
Although gently spoken~ her tone w~s slightly re-&#xD;
proachful, and Clifford hurried to say:&#xD;
"My poor child, I do not refuse your sympathy, but it&#xD;
is only a money matter that troubles me, and I did not&#xD;
care to worry you with it."&#xD;
"Whatever worries a husband should worry a wife,&#xD;
&#xD;
and whatever gives pleasure to him should give pleasure&#xD;
to her." are an angel;" and seizing her hand,&#xD;
"Virginia, you&#xD;
Clifford kissed it, in his usual hot-headed, impulsive style..&#xD;
But his heart smote him afresh; for with all her trans-&#xD;
cern-lent virtues and beauties of character, he did not love&#xD;
her; although she was his wife, his heart would not be&#xD;
forced into loving her, and he added earnestly and truth-&#xD;
fully:&#xD;
"I am not worthy of you 1"&#xD;
Then letting her little thin, white hand drop, he rested&#xD;
his head upon the table and sighed a deep sigh.&#xD;
Without noticing his last words, Virginia said:&#xD;
"What about the money, Clifford ?"&#xD;
"I want a certain amount for a special purpose, but&#xD;
I fear it will be impossible to raise it," he answered, with-&#xD;
out looking up.&#xD;
"What is the amount?"&#xD;
lie named it, and then taking his hat walked out into&#xD;
the summer starlight, then down town, then-into a&#xD;
drinking-salo~u, while the wife sat in her room weeping,&#xD;
because she was so miserable.&#xD;
Thus two lives were wearing wretchedly away; but&#xD;
the sun shone, the flowers bloomed, the birds sang, and,&#xD;
the world went on all the same.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
FOREVER?&#xD;
T'S. fortunate that men and women are not ex~&#xD;
pected to g&amp;amp; oii doing the same thing forever&#xD;
like Tennyson's monotonous little " Brook I"&#xD;
What a stupid world if they were! Nor do they ex-&#xD;
pect to march to the end of time all abreast down a long&#xD;
lane that never turns, even if the philosophers do tell us&#xD;
that reason is a straight line. No, indeed! for flogarth's&#xD;
nice little idea about a curve being the line of beauty,&#xD;
Dpsets all such straight-laced doctrines as these too com-&#xD;
pletely. For does not the world go in for beauty, with&#xD;
reason ~u con~traire? Exactly! and sometimes with the&#xD;
d-.-l in full view.&#xD;
"Uncle, mother writes that she is nearly crazy to see&#xD;
me!" said Gertrude, handing him an open letter, which&#xD;
she had just finished reading.&#xD;
"Well!'~ answered the maternal relative, still looking&#xD;
over his paper; for when was a man ever doing anything&#xD;
else? If there are no papers up yonder, what will they&#xD;
do with themselves? Worry the angels correspondingly?&#xD;
"And I say, I am nearly crazy to see her," again sug-&#xD;
gested Gertrude.&#xD;
"W011?" taking' up another paper, which eulogized&#xD;
the action he tools upon a certain bill in the late Congress,&#xD;
and looking through it with that feeling of grati~cation&#xD;
which springs from knowing one's efforts are appreciated.&#xD;
&#xD;
True, the papers were in regular order at the time we&#xD;
make our descent upon "Pleasant Retreat," for it was&#xD;
morning, and the hour, breakfast. Mr. hail sat at the head&#xD;
of the table poriiig~Yver his papers, as before intimated-.&#xD;
Gertrude sat upon his right reading her letters, and Paul&#xD;
sat at the foot, reading a paper, of course. For once,&#xD;
broiled chickens, waffles, hot-rolls, muffins, omelets, and&#xD;
coffee lost their charms; and from the way the mail was'&#xD;
being devoured," 'Liza-Jane" feared the~ appetites would&#xD;
be appeased before they reached her tempting dishes; for&#xD;
she came and went from dining-room to kitchen, being a&#xD;
silent spectator of all that was going on, and thinking to&#xD;
herself that one of her breakfasts was worth more than&#xD;
all the pepeis and letters in the universe. "Ellen" had&#xD;
served tl~o coffee, and "Fanny" kept her fly-brush mov~&#xD;
ing energetically, although there wasn't a fly to be seen,,&#xD;
and still nothing was touched. Standing it as long as she&#xD;
could, "'Liza-Jane" now made her appearance with hot&#xD;
waffles, and having handed them around without elicit-&#xD;
ing any attention whatever, she took the liberty of touch-&#xD;
ing the head of the family and saying:&#xD;
"Marster, everything's gittin' cold; why don't yer eat?&#xD;
Dem chickens iz jis as iiice as can be, fur one o' em is dat&#xD;
speckled pullet, and other one is dat yaller-leg rooster&#xD;
what I showed you 'isterday when I was a feeding 'em.&#xD;
Don't, yer 'member?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes, 'Liza, in a minute;" and he went on with&#xD;
his paper. In despair, she then appealed to Gertrude,&#xD;
saying:&#xD;
"flab some o' dese waffles, Miss 'Trude? Dey's nice&#xD;
*~nd hot."&#xD;

"Thank you, 'Liza, I will," she said, as she was now -&#xD;
through reading her. letters; "for as I am, neither a Sen.&#xD;
ator nor a candidate for Congressional or State honors, I&#xD;
am not so deeply interested in the papers, and I will pro~&#xD;
ceed to eat my breakfast."&#xD;
"What's that yo.u are saying, Miss Impudence," asked&#xD;
the uncle, who, no matter how deaf he was to the appeals&#xD;
of every one else, always had an ear open to whatever&#xD;
she said; and laying down the papers, he proceeded to&#xD;
follow her example, by eating his breakfast.&#xD;
"Nothing of importance to a Senator," replied the&#xD;
niece, with an aadacity that was pardonable in such a&#xD;
pretty woman.&#xD;
"Indeed?" answered the Senator, trying to look very&#xD;
dignified and austere.&#xD;
"Was it, Mr. Maxwell?"&#xD;
"Certainly not," said the addressed; and the truth is,&#xD;
he would have sworn that black was white, or any other&#xD;
absurdity that Gertrude desired, so gratified was he at&#xD;
being noticed by her at all.&#xD;
"Oh! of course, Hr. Maxwell is too polite to disagree&#xD;
with a lady. But here, I want all this nonsense between&#xD;
you two stopped; and II want you, Gertrude; to call that&#xD;
boy Paul. Do you hear?"&#xD;
"May I ?" she asked, with a bewitching smile, and an&#xD;
irresTistible glance from her expressive gray eyes, which&#xD;
thrilled him with a strange delight as he answered:&#xD;
"I shall be only too happy if you will;" and from that&#xD;
moment his infatuation was more intense than ever be.&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
"Well, now, that being settled, tell me, Gertrude, what&#xD;
it was you were saying about your mother."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I said she was crazy to see me."&#xD;
7Of course, a woman is always crazy about something.&#xD;
If it isn't a dress or a bonnet, it's a child or a poodle, or&#xD;
something else equally insignificant!"&#xD;
"A child or a poodle!" exclaimed the indignant&#xD;
beauty. But her indignation was only momentary, and&#xD;
she joined her uncle and Paul in their laugh in spite of&#xD;
herself.&#xD;
"Come, don't go into heroics, diild. It's too hot, and&#xD;
besides, they are out of date."&#xD;
"Uncle, you've no more feeling than a brute!"&#xD;
"Surely, now, we can play quits and each feel sufilci-&#xD;
ently avenged. But tell me, what are you going to do&#xD;
with this crazy mother of yours?"&#xD;
"I'm going to see her!"&#xD;
"The mischief you are! Who said so?" -&#xD;
"Nobody!"&#xD;
"How do you know you are, then?"&#xD;
"I just know it!" (womanly~.)&#xD;
"Who's going with you?"&#xD;
"I don't know that either!"&#xD;
"Nor don't care 2"&#xD;
"Not particularly."&#xD;
"But I thought you were to stay with me?"&#xD;
"Forever?"&#xD;
"Certainly !"&#xD;
"When I'm married, and for all time?" -&#xD;
"Of course!" and a meaning glance exchanged with&#xD;
Paul might have revealed a fond desire, if not a secret&#xD;
understanding between* the two. But it was lost on&#xD;
Gertrude, as she answered in surprise:&#xD;
"And never go to see my mother?. Why, uncle!"&#xD;

Without noticing her reference to her mother, he said:&#xD;
"When do you go?"&#xD;
"At once!"&#xD;
"Bat you haven't asked my permission?"&#xD;
"But I will , though;" and leaving her seat she knelt at&#xD;
his feet, and rested her roui~d white arms upon his knees;&#xD;
then clasping her little, soft white hands together, looked&#xD;
up into his face iii her most killing way, and said:&#xD;
"Dear uncle, may I go home to see my mother?"&#xD;
The veriest woman-hater would have been vanquished&#xD;
by such a beautiful petitioner, and raising her to a seat&#xD;
on his knee, Mr. Hall said:&#xD;
"Ab me! you women know so well how to steal into a&#xD;
man's heart and carry him captive, whether he wil~ it or&#xD;
not."&#xD;
"Do we, though? And if we do, who has been bold&#xD;
enough to dare to try to steal into yQur hard old bacho-&#xD;
br's heart."&#xD;
"Here is the daring little rogue;" and putting both&#xD;
arms around her, he kissed her affectionately, while his&#xD;
heart glox~ed with a warmth for her that he had never&#xD;
felt for any one else.&#xD;
"I feel much complimented, uncle, and I trust I shall&#xD;
never be supplanted."&#xD;
"No danger; never fear."&#xD;
"But am II. to go home?"&#xD;
U you will I suppose you must, and I want you to&#xD;
tell your mother to get you ready to go to Washington&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
"Oh uncle, how delightful that will be!"&#xD;
"It is now the last of September--i shall go in No&#xD;
member, so you ~have. plenty of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh dear, h~w charming that will be!" then catching&#xD;
a glimpse of Paid's face, which instead of reflecting back&#xD;
her happiness, as she anticipated, wore really a sad ex-&#xD;
pression, she hurried to say:                 N&#xD;
"And will you not take Paul too?" for the first time&#xD;
calling him by his name.&#xD;
"Of course, and ~ Liza-Jane,' and 'Harry;' and we&#xD;
will keep house, as we do here."&#xD;
"I certainly am obliged to you both," said Paul, "and IL&#xD;
only wish that I could join you, but by November 1 ex~&#xD;
pect to be in 1~he far West."&#xD;
"What nonsense! to talk of leaving dear old Georgia.&#xD;
I wouldn't give her for every other State in the Union."&#xD;
"Good!" said Mr. Hall, as his heart echoed the~&#xD;
sentiment of Gertrude. "Spoken as my nie~e~ should&#xD;
speak. But, Paul, I thongh1~ you baa al)andoned the&#xD;
Western trip.~ At any rate you will take another trip first,&#xD;
and that will be to see this young lady home, as it is un-&#xD;
possible for me to go with her."&#xD;
"But suppose Paul doesn't want to go?" asked Ger-&#xD;
trude quickly.&#xD;
"But he does want to go," was the ready rejoinder.&#xD;
"But suppose I don't want you to go?" she asked with&#xD;
a side look from underneath her long, dark lashes.&#xD;
"That alters the case," was the disappointed reply.&#xD;
"Don't mind her, Paul; she's dying to have you go, b~t&#xD;
you know women are never happy unless they are tor~&#xD;
meeting somebody. So I'll leave you to fix it between&#xD;
you, for I have already given too much time to your non-&#xD;

without intending it, of course c?), to lose his heart more&#xD;

Who knows~?                                                                    OIIAPTER X&#xD;

WEEK later, Virginia Ii&#xD;
for the amount he had na&#xD;
at it, a hot flush swept ov&#xD;
it into her lap, he said:&#xD;
"Viro'inia! how could you m~&#xD;
b&#xD;
"Mortify yop, Clifford?" and ti&#xD;
suffused with tears.&#xD;
"Yes, mortify! for your father&#xD;
"lie does not even know that&#xD;
it for myself; and besides, what&#xD;
his money but give it to me? lie&#xD;
it all belongs to me, and has espc&#xD;
shall never hesitate to ask him&#xD;

But Clifford did not answer, cvc&#xD;
pride was deeply wounded, and he&#xD;
of Iidw his father had. influenced h&#xD;
instead of teaching him to ignore&#xD;
come legitimately, or that was w&#xD;
lab~r and industry. But even tho&#xD;
instilled these precepts into him,&#xD;
and his native nobility of soul was&#xD;

&#xD;
*A CItEVKI&#xD;
&#xD;
he wanted the money, because it would save his father,&#xD;
because it won Id relieve his mother, because it would&#xD;
again rescue the dear old "Manor," but as yet he could&#xD;
not bring himself to the revolting act of touching that&#xD;
check.&#xD;
"2tT~blesse oblige" said Wtake it!"&#xD;
Then why did he hesitate?&#xD;
Because his' conscience said, "you married that girl&#xD;
for her money," "you are receiving and not giving," " you&#xD;
are taking what is not due, and you know it i~ wrong."&#xD;
What a troublesome thing a conscience is.!&#xD;
There was nothing little in Clifford~s nature; indeed, he&#xD;
could not even contemplate a small action without loath-&#xD;
ing, and had he been left untrammeled, lie would have&#xD;
died before doing for himself what he had done for his&#xD;
father.&#xD;
"Nobles8e oblige!" a pretty motto for a seal, ai~d a&#xD;
beautiful theory in the al~stract.&#xD;
But when it means a sacrifice of all moral obligation,&#xD;
when it means an utter disregard of the better nature,&#xD;
when it means to set at defiance God's holy laws; is it so&#xD;
beautiful?&#xD;
Granting, which we all do, that it is rig~it and proper&#xD;
for families to stand by each other, it does not follow that&#xD;
it is a Jilial duty to commit crime in doing so. Truly,&#xD;
"money is the root of all evil," and he who makes it the&#xD;
motive spring of his life, he who puts it in the place of&#xD;
his God, will admit a demon into his breast which shall&#xD;
give him no rest, and which shall corrupt the moral facul-.&#xD;
ties so that vice will seem virtue.&#xD;
While Clifford sat buried in thought which must have&#xD;
beeu painful, judging by the troubled expression upon&#xD;
&#xD;
!his face, Virginia sa~t watching him with feelings of the&#xD;
deepest anxiety and sympathy, for she loved him.&#xD;
What mattered it then that he loved another&#xD;
lie could not help it, neither could she I ielp loving him;&#xD;
more's the pity for botl~&#xD;
So, in that hour, she forgot all his coldness and indiffer-.&#xD;
ence which cut into her loving heart like a keen blade-&#xD;
she only remembered that he was in trouble-that he ~as&#xD;
unhappy, and with her woman's ready sympathy sh~e asked&#xD;
herself: "What can I do fur him?"&#xD;
She had offered her assistance-it had been rejected-.&#xD;
and with her usual timidity she almost shrank from mak-&#xD;
ing another effort. But a woman who truly love~ cannot&#xD;
sit down xvith folded hands, when the loved one is suffer-&#xD;
ing; and so, with all the courage she could command, she&#xD;
leant on the table near him and said:&#xD;
"Clifford, I beg that you will take this check. Do not&#xD;
do it because you want to, but simply because I ask you&#xD;
to." Still his position remained unchanged, and he&#xD;
seemed buried in the most painful reflections. Watching&#xD;
him with intense interest, she said again:&#xD;
"Something troubles you. I do not know what it i~,&#xD;
but God knows, if I could help you, I would love to do it."&#xD;
They were simple words, but so full of truth that they&#xD;
touched Clifford's heart more than a thousand passionate&#xD;
protestations from any other lips would have done.&#xD;
For an instant there was a pang in his heart, there&#xD;
were tears in hi~ eyes, and drawing Virginia to him with&#xD;
one arm, he said:&#xD;
"My poor wife I if you knew all, you would~pity me;"&#xD;
and leaning over, he pressed his. lips to her brow.&#xD;
"Why not tell me all, then, Clifford? Why do .~you&#xD;

not confide in me? I feel that I am only a wife in name&#xD;
--I fear I am only a burden, instead 'of a comfort to you.&#xD;
Come, Clifford, tell inc all; will you not?&#xD;
" God ~ I cannot! " and puslung her gently from him,&#xD;
he walked the floor impatiently, while she, poor child,&#xD;
leant back ~in her chair, and tri~d to choke down the tears&#xD;
that were bursting from lmer~ heart. Cannot! Is there&#xD;
anything you cannot tell your wife-she who should be&#xD;
alike the partner of your joys 'and woes? If there is,&#xD;
remember~ while you read these hues, that there is a wall&#xD;
growing up between you, which, in comhmg years, no&#xD;
affection can climb oveu', no amount of love can batter&#xD;
down. For there CO1U~5 a time when "too late" is&#xD;
written down as the result of such conduct; and you will&#xD;
find then, to your sorrow, that you cannot retrieve the&#xD;
past. You may mend the future, but remember, that&#xD;
when a heart is once estranged by slights, by coldness, by&#xD;
continual neglect and indifference, that all the attentions,&#xD;
all the devotion, all the assiduity in the world cannot put&#xD;
back into it the freshness, the confidin~ love, the warmth,&#xD;
which h~s been frozen out of it. A. deep chasm lies be-&#xD;
tween you and the happy past, when you 'could have&#xD;
built up in your wife's heart a great love for you. The&#xD;
dreary, cheerfess present is upon you; the bleak, hopeless&#xD;
future is before you; and on the banks of this chasm, so&#xD;
close that you might clasp each other's hand if you chose&#xD;
you walk singly down the declivity to eternity. What&#xD;
a picture! ~You two, who should be one! You two, who&#xD;
should be the support and comfort of each other's de-&#xD;
clining years, trudging' on alone. And yet this is what&#xD;
must come, if you begin your married life' without love,&#xD;
and then' live~ that life strangers.&#xD;

"Clifford, I ask you again to take this check;" and&#xD;
slipping her hand in his arm, Virginia joined her hus-&#xD;
band in his walk across the room.&#xD;
"If you'll promise not to hate me, I'll take it;" and&#xD;
he looked searchingly into her face to see if . she could&#xD;
say one thing and mean another.&#xD;
"Hate you, Clifford?" while her soft blue eyes re-&#xD;
turned the searching lookNhe gave. "That would be im-&#xD;
possible!" and lookiiig at her love-lit face, one could not&#xD;
help believing that she spoke the truth. Then turning to&#xD;
Clifford, it did not seem strange that women adored him,&#xD;
for he was handsome, intellectual, fascinating, the soul of&#xD;
honor and chivalry; and his faults, as we see, were de-&#xD;
veloped by wrong paternal training, and a chain of cir-&#xD;
cumstances which were beyond his control.&#xD;
It's all very well for successful people to say, "I would&#xD;
have risen superior to circumstances;" but if they have&#xD;
l)een so fortunate as to steer clear of the breakers, we&#xD;
think that charity would be more commendable than&#xD;
arrogance, when they see a brother threatened with ship-&#xD;
wreck. For let them remember, that so long as life lasts,&#xD;
and even until their bark is anchored on the shores of&#xD;
Eternal Rest, there is danger.&#xD;
The wife's last appeal and- assurance won! Clifford&#xD;
took the check, and going straight to his office, enclosed&#xD;
it itl\ a letter to his father. Th&amp;amp; communication was&#xD;
enough to have moved a heart of stone; but, doubtless,&#xD;
upon its reception, it will ~be tossed into the fire with&#xD;
oaths, while the check will be seized with all the' avidity&#xD;
which a man can feel who has made nioney his God.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
&#xD;
MAY 1&#xD;
&#xD;
ERT1~tTDE had now been home several days&#xD;
and of course everybody knew it-for an inci-&#xD;
dent in the village was almost as rare as a case&#xD;
of small-pox, and in consequence, not to be overlooked.&#xD;
her arrival formed the principal topic of conversation&#xD;
in the community, and the fact that Paul Maxwell had&#xD;
escorted her, was sufficient provocation for the committee&#xD;
of arrangements to announce an engagement, and appoint&#xD;
an early day for the marriage. They did everything but&#xD;
make the trou8seu,~ and issue cards ,of invitation ;and&#xD;
some of the extra-knowing ones said that" all that prepara-&#xD;
tion for Washington meant a' wedding."&#xD;
Everybody had been to welcome Gertrude home, and&#xD;
much to the chagrin of the few (?j~ visitors who loved, not&#xD;
truth less, but news more, the name of the strange young&#xD;
man was not mentioned by either mother or daughter.&#xD;
This was more than woman nature conld stand, and for&#xD;
revenge, the invisible class of reporters known as "they&#xD;
say" wove a pretty little story, which, for warp, woof~ and.&#xD;
~ilhng, was all their own&#xD;
Mrs. Lawrence found Gertrude muck' stronger in&#xD;
health and happier in spirits, and with that fond delusion&#xD;
which makes' desire belief, she flattered herself that five&#xD;
months of absence had worked a radical change ~in her&#xD;
daughter for the better.&#xD;
&#xD;
1'81&#xD;
&#xD;
She thought she had forgotten the "old love," and&#xD;
secretly hoped ~she was on with "the new '" for Pa~I was&#xD;
a. great favorite with both mother and uncle, and accord-&#xD;
ing to the world's phraseology, "a good initch for any&#xD;
girL" So little do mothers, even, know of the hearts of&#xD;
their children. True, Gertrude's past was buried out of&#xD;
sight, but was it forgotten? She was a woman of deep&#xD;
and lasting feeling, not a humming-bird flitting from&#xD;
flower to flower, and down in her heart were memories&#xD;
which death alone ~ould uproot. But the roses again&#xD;
bloomed in her cheeks, her step was light and elastic, and&#xD;
her laugh and song once more rang merrily through the&#xD;
house. The neighbors, whom she ran in and out to see,&#xD;
were deligl~ ted to have her back, and in their eagerness&#xD;
to tell her a~l the news, never failed to inform her of how&#xD;
dreadfully dissipated Clifford Troup had become, or of&#xD;
how wretchedly Mrs. Troup looked. These things, Ger-&#xD;
trude well knew, were told to her for effect; but the&#xD;
curious eyes that watched for a blush or a tremor were&#xD;
disappointed, for she held her feelings well in check, and&#xD;
quietly dismissed the subject by saying:&#xD;
"The reports must be exaggerated."&#xD;
As much a~ she heard, though, she was poorly prepared&#xD;
for the wreck she met in returning Mrs. Baker's call; and&#xD;
indeed it was difficult to realize that the pale, sad woman,&#xD;
who exchanged- the usual conventionalities w th her, was&#xD;
the blooming bride from whom she parted a few months&#xD;
before. Yet it wa's true, and such is the havoc that . a&#xD;
mind diseased can play with a body that is healthy.&#xD;
Strange to say, Gertrude had not yet even caught a&#xD;
glimpse of clifford, but to those who know aught of the&#xD;
iniier feelings, it will be~no matter of surprise to hear&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="182-183" xml:id="VAC8257-00000091"/>&#xD;
that they thought of each other mutually. Perhaps it&#xD;
was the wrong thing for them to do, but they did it&#xD;
nevertheless, and meant no harm in thus thinking'&#xD;
Paul's visit, was now drawing to a close, and as this&#xD;
was his last afternoon, Gertrude had promised him a&#xD;
drive and a walk through The Terraces.&#xD;
The horses stood pawing impatiently at the gate, and&#xD;
while the young lady in question, was giving the ifflishing&#xD;
touches to her toilette, her escort walked thoughtfully&#xD;
back and forth upon the vine-covered gallery, clreamiiig&#xD;
of the future-of what it might be.&#xD;
For once, be it remembered, one human being took the&#xD;
advice of another; for since the day when Mr. hail ad~&#xD;
vised Paul to do his wooing by actions rather than words,&#xD;
he followed his counsel to the letter. Scarcely a day&#xD;
passel but he sent her something-a bouquet, a basket of&#xD;
fruit, a bunch of grapes, a book, a piece of music, or some&#xD;
little thing which spoke more eloquefitly, yet mn6re deli-&#xD;
cately, than words. Words would have been rejected, and&#xD;
perhaps have induced a coldness which would have been&#xD;
a* death-blow to even friendship between theni; but the&#xD;
little gifts which were daily sent and daily accepted were&#xD;
softening the heart unconsciously, and perchance, paving&#xD;
the way to future success. Who knows?&#xD;
However, our surmises may be all wrong, ~for there&#xD;
never have been any flied laws by which to judge of&#xD;
womankind, and measuring the future by the past, there&#xD;
never will be, so long as a woman's a~woman.&#xD;
"You see, Paul, punctuality is not one of my virtues;&#xD;
I hope patience is one of yours;" and this was the apol.&#xD;
ogy for detaining him nearly one hour behind their ap.&#xD;
pointmnent-something not unusual for women to do, since&#xD;
&#xD;
182                  MAY                                                             MAY i?                  183:&#xD;
&#xD;
their minutes are other people's hours, and seconds a&#xD;
period pf time not set down in their calendars.&#xD;
With his heart all in a flutter, Paul forgot all time car-&#xD;
dinal virtues, and all the cardinal sins, and everything&#xD;
but the beautiful woman before him, as he gallantly re-&#xD;
plied:&#xD;
"To wait an eternity for you would be nothing, so you&#xD;
came at last;" and his very soul beamed through his&#xD;
eyes, as he spoke.&#xD;
"Come, come," said Qertrude, blushing and feeling&#xD;
very uncomfortably, as he handed her into the buggy;&#xD;
"you must not flatter me."&#xD;
"Why not?" taking up the reins, and rather glad of an&#xD;
outlet for what he feared was too much enthusiasm for&#xD;
the present.&#xD;
"So you confess it was flattery?" with an arch of her&#xD;
faultless eyebrows.&#xD;
"I'll confess anything you wish me t&amp;amp;," Was the playful&#xD;
rejoinder.&#xD;
"And are these ~the teachings you have received at&#xD;
'The Retreat '? I'll have to report you to uncle."&#xD;
'~ But you can't eXl)ect to confine a man to any teach-&#xD;
ings or any particular theories, when he is in the presence&#xD;
of a beautiful woman;" and again his heart poured forth&#xD;
its fullness against his will.&#xD;
"Why what is th&amp;amp; matter with you this evening? I&#xD;
never heard you talk so before. But 'see, what a lovely&#xD;
place we are passing 1"&#xD;
"Yes, it's very beautiful; but speaking of your uncle,&#xD;
would you believe that he was ever guilty of planning a&#xD;
love-campaign?"&#xD;
"No, never!"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8257-00000092"/>&#xD;
~[84                   MAY i?&#xD;

"INot for himself, but for a friend!"&#xD;
"~6t he never thinks of such silly things!" with a&#xD;
sneer.&#xD;
"Such silly things, Aid you say?"&#xD;
"Idid!"&#xD;
A rapid drive had brought them to The Terraces, and&#xD;
as they entered the beautiful grounds, Paul wa~ saying:&#xD;
"But you didn't mean what you said ? ~&#xD;
"how do you know?" evasively.&#xD;
"Which is worse, flattery or falsehood ?"&#xD;
"Falsehood?" and as Gertrude stood beneath one of&#xD;
the numerous arches of evergreens, in those bewildering&#xD;
gardens, she tried to look indignant, but upon catching a&#xD;
glance from Paul's mischievous eyes, she couldn't help&#xD;
laughing, at the same time saying: "I think you are very&#xD;
impertinent!"&#xD;
"A thousand pardons," gracefully lifting his hat, "for,&#xD;
really, J didn't mean to be;" and as he looked into her&#xD;
face, she could not doubt his words. "Am IL forgiveix?"&#xD;
"Oh, I suppose so; but don't let us waste our time in&#xD;
such idle talk, when we h~ve only a little while to ex~joy&#xD;
this lovely spot;" and with these words she turned do~vxi&#xD;
one of the broad, shaded avenues throi~gh whose over-&#xD;
arching boughs the setting sun was forcing a few sti'ag-&#xD;
gling ~bcams. Paul followed her, and said,~ rather re-&#xD;
proachfully:&#xD;
"~Suclx idle talk ! ~&#xD;
"Yes, I never feel like talking here; I always feel&#xD;
silenced by the beauty of the surroundings. See here!"&#xD;
and as they stood beneath a grand old oak, Paul followed&#xD;
the direction of Ixer finger, and read, in German text of&#xD;
evergreen letters tipon the ground: "GQd is Love."&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
* "That's my doctrine,~' he answered, "and I have&#xD;
always argued and felt that if the world is not saved by&#xD;
love, that it c~n never be saved by fear; for. men will not&#xD;
be ruled by the law of compulsion, not even in the salva.&#xD;
tion of their souls."&#xD;
Busy with the memories of other days, Gertrude. wan-&#xD;
dered on silently, until they reached* a spot known as&#xD;
"the parlor," the furniture consisting of arm-chairs and&#xD;
divans cut out of the oedars.&#xD;
There she sat do~vn, while Paul walked leisurely back&#xD;
and forth, and the quietness of the hour stole over them&#xD;
like the inhalation of some soothing ether, chilling their&#xD;
senses and making them feel at peace with all the world.&#xD;
Gertrude's face was always sad when in repose, but Paul&#xD;
fancied there was a pained expression mingled with the&#xD;
sadness that evening; and so there was, for the grounds~&#xD;
recalled the happiest hours of her life and the most&#xD;
wretched. Forgetting that any one was n~ar, a sigh&#xD;
escaped her, and she only remembered that she was not&#xD;
alone ~vhen Paul said:&#xD;
"Why do you sigh?"&#xD;
"For the days that are no more." Paul felt an un-&#xD;
comfortable twinge about the heart at these words; for&#xD;
the gossip about her old love-affair had reached him during&#xD;
his stay iii the village, and although he fancied he was&#xD;
indifferent to the ~mors, a little pang just then told a&#xD;
different story.&#xD;
"I wish I could recall them for you, if they would give&#xD;
you pleasure ; '~ and he watched her to see the effect of his&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"If you would not give mc pain, rec~ell your wish," she&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8257-00000093"/>&#xD;
186             MAi? 1&#xD;
&#xD;
said, with an attempt at a smile, which ended in a sigh.&#xD;
Then arising, she walked bn, saying:&#xD;
"You should know the lovely woman who presides&#xD;
over these grounds; but if, as they say, one' life takes&#xD;
coloring from their employment, we should ~5tb e sur-&#xD;
prised at her purity of character', for these flowers and&#xD;
her God are her daily companions."&#xD;
"With such companions I can readily believe all that&#xD;
you tell me, for next to communion with God, there can&#xD;
be no associations so refining and so pure as the society&#xD;
and cultivation of flowers."&#xD;
* Then they walked on silently, beneath trees covered&#xD;
with ivy and surmounted with rustic bird-houses, around&#xD;
which the swallows flitted, beneath arched of evergreens,&#xD;
down ivy-covered terraces, past beds of heliotropes, ger-&#xD;
aniums, oleanders, and orange-trees; on tl~ rough the&#xD;
twilight air, which was heavy with the perfume of inyr-&#xD;
jads of roses, through patches of light and shadow, by&#xD;
murmuring fonn~tains, while the young crescent kissed&#xD;
the whole with its silver beams, and the birds twittered&#xD;
good-night, and a grayish pifrple haze settled down upon&#xD;
the lovely scene. When giving one last lingering loof~,&#xD;
they felt, "how beautiful !"&#xD;
Their souls were surfeited to sadness, their natures&#xD;
were soothed to gentleness, their hearts were too full for&#xD;
utterance, and driving slowly do~vn the lawn, they almost&#xD;
regretted having come, since they had to leave; but&#xD;
neither spoke. Gertrude felt that Paul was too much a&#xD;
member of the family to be talked to unless she fek like&#xD;
it, and only too glad to indulge any whim of hers, he&#xD;
was kind enough to leave her alone; so they drove silently&#xD;
along in the deepening twilight.&#xD;
&#xD;
A few moments more, and they stood at the door of&#xD;
her home with clasped hands.&#xD;
"Good-by," said Paul.&#xD;
"Oh, dear; don't tell me 'good-by.' I never say&#xD;
~11~&#xD;
goou-1y'to any one.&#xD;
'But Pm going away, and perhaps we may never&#xD;
meet again."&#xD;
"So much the more reason why I shall not say 'good-&#xD;
by.' So go-go quickly, and P11 run and get aii old&#xD;
shoe to throw after you for good luck;" and while she&#xD;
went to put her words into execution, Mrs. Lawrence*&#xD;
came out and said:&#xD;
"Will you not remain to tea, Paul ?"&#xD;
"No, thank you, as I have only time to arrange my&#xD;
little matters before the stage leaves. Have you any rues-&#xD;
sages for your bi'other?"&#xD;
"Yes; tell him we are well, and that I owe hi!n many&#xD;
thanks for returning Gertrude to me so strong and happy.&#xD;
Tell hi in, also, that I will have her ready f~r the Wash-&#xD;
ington trip-but, I have a letter *" and as she went in to&#xD;
get it, Gertrude came out laughing and saying:&#xD;
"Why, haven't you gone yet, Paul? The shoe is&#xD;
'ready;" and she held up a tiny slipper to verify her&#xD;
words.         -&#xD;
"No, I haven't gone, because I have a repiest to make&#xD;
before I go."&#xD;
"What is it?"&#xD;
"May I write to you?"&#xD;
"If you like ; ~' with a shrug of the shoulders.&#xD;
"Don't be so indifferent! Will you answer my&#xD;
letters?"&#xD;

" I suppose !" with a tantalizing air, as her- mother&#xD;
joined them.&#xD;
" Oh, mother, Paul wishes me to correspond with him.&#xD;
May I "&#xD;
" Certainly, my darling ; I have no objection. How-&#xD;
ever, do as you like."&#xD;
Then handing the letter to Paul, he grasped her hand,&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
" Good-by, Mrs. Lawrence. You surely have no objec-&#xD;
tion to telling me 'good-by.'"&#xD;
" Only the pain of parting with one I like so much."&#xD;
It was hard to conceal his real feelings, and be' as in-&#xD;
different as he thought it best to be; but he was equal to&#xD;
the occasion, and, assuming 'a gayety which appeared ex-&#xD;
ceedingly natural, he turned to Gertrude, and said,&#xD;
smilingly:&#xD;
" Good-by 1"&#xD;
"Na, no, not that to me."&#xD;
" What must I say, then?"&#xD;
" Au revoir !"&#xD;
" Au revoir, then, with all my heart !" and bowing&#xD;
gracefully, he took, his departure, while Gertrude lau gh-&#xD;
ingiy threw the slipper after him. Stooping, he picked&#xD;
it up, and, turning back, heard Mrs. Lawrence say :-&#xD;
" Why, daughter !"&#xD;
"Why, mother !" then fell upon his ears ; and hurry-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
LNso!&#xD;
YOUNG girl sat with beautiful hands folded&#xD;
idly upon her lap, looking out of the window at&#xD;
the sky, but she didn't know it was the sky. Now&#xD;
and then she heaved a sigh, but knew it not. Anon she-&#xD;
took up a book, but to throw it down.&#xD;
Then she tried her music, but ended as abruptly as she&#xD;
began; and if the truth must be told, she thought it would&#xD;
be an immense satisfaction to' pitch the piano into the&#xD;
ocean, for thus refusing to comfort her once. .&#xD;
Then, she tried to talk to her mother, but after a few&#xD;
questions and as many drowsy monosyllables for replies,&#xD;
the conversation died. Sewing was then resorted to, but&#xD;
as the needle only pricked her finger, that was soon aban-&#xD;
doned in despair. Sleep was then'thought of as the last&#xD;
hope, but the coquettish goddess was not to be entrapped&#xD;
that day, and thus, the last resource proved as great a-fail-&#xD;
ure as the first. At length the neighbors were thought&#xD;
of, but they were dismissed with a shudder, and this semi-&#xD;
wretched girl finally settled down to being' lonesome and&#xD;
mniserab~le in dead earnest.&#xD;
The world, that great ignoramus, that thinks it knows&#xD;
everything, but really knows nothing, said she ought to&#xD;
be very happy ; and as the world said so, it ought to have&#xD;
been so; but wgas sheik&#xD;
Else why was she lonesome?&#xD;

&#xD;
Was it because a bright face that she had seen daiiy&#xD;
for months was gone&#xD;
She would not admit, even to herself, that this was the&#xD;
cause; but we, who have no concealments to make, will&#xD;
acknowledge it for her.&#xD;
And so she sat--not oniy lonesome, but lonely.&#xD;
.   .           .    .    .   .    0   ..g&#xD;
" Pleasant Retreat" looked like it had furnished a first-&#xD;
class funeral for the sober reflection of the world, and the&#xD;
master wore the. air of chief-mourner, as-he said aloud:&#xD;
" How I miss her !"&#xD;
And so you see people do soliloquize somewhere else&#xD;
than in Shakspeare's plays.&#xD;
It was no matter of surprise that he was lonesome, for&#xD;
is it nothing to have life, light, beauty, and youth taken&#xD;
from out a crumbling ruin is it nothing to have the&#xD;
warmnth and sunshine taken away from a heart that must&#xD;
boi-row its freshness from just such a source?&#xD;
Is it nothing to sit waiting for a merry laugh-a light&#xD;
song-a sweet kiss-a quick footstep-a lovely form-a-&#xD;
loving word Try it, and see if you will not be lonesome&#xD;
when it is taken away.&#xD;
And No. 8 was lonesome too ! Only think of it ! Three&#xD;
human beings in this busy, bustling. world, and ~all so&#xD;
lonesome ! Listless, he sat with Blackstone open before&#xD;
him, and the pages tantalizingly reflected her beautiful&#xD;
features. Then he would sigh and look at the trees, and&#xD;
even they looked dreary ; the air was, heavy with lone-&#xD;
someness, and his dog, partaking of his mood, looked as&#xD;
disconsolate as his young master, as he snapped drowsily&#xD;
at the flies which tormented him.&#xD;
&#xD;
Then there was an absolute pang came into his heart,&#xD;
as he remembered her indifference. Of course it was all&#xD;
about a woman-misery- and mischief generally 'are.&#xD;
From being lonesome he became restless-the house be-&#xD;
came intolerable, and throwing down his book, he went&#xD;
into the woods; but even there the red and golden trees&#xD;
sighed mournfully, the little squirrel cracked his nut&#xD;
drowsily, and the whole world seemed Lonesome.&#xD;

patient reply; and, with burning cheeks, Gertrude left&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
The place she did not feel like going to was Judge&#xD;
Baker's; the occasion, an invitation to meet the success-&#xD;
ful candidate and a few friends who had worked ener-&#xD;
getically to seenre his election.&#xD;
The triumphant man was Clifford Troup; and while&#xD;
Gertrude rejoiced in his good fortune, she would rather&#xD;
not have met him.&#xD;
Who can blame her?&#xD;
Certainly, not you and I, who know everything; rather&#xD;
should we commend her for wishing to avoid him. Bat&#xD;
that scarecrow, public opinion, and her mothei~'s wishes,&#xD;
forced her into unwilling obedience, and against her incli-&#xD;
nations she accepted the invitation. She ran over alone,&#xD;
as :it was 50 near' and soon after her arrival a baud of&#xD;
music and a crowd of men gathered in the street before&#xD;
the house. After some soul-stirring music by the band,&#xD;
cries of "Troup, Troup," rai~g out upon the night air, and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
it was evident that nothing but the sight of the ccuiquer-&#xD;
ing hero would satisfy the enthusiastic demand.&#xD;
As yet, Gertrude had not, seen him, for he was stand-&#xD;
ing at the extreme end of the gallery, talking to a group&#xD;
of gentlemen. Increased calls from the crowd brought&#xD;
him forward; and in a graceful little speech, which pos-&#xD;
sessed the unusual merit of not having a word too much&#xD;
r a word too little, he thanked his constituents for the&#xD;
h nor they had conferred upon him, and pledged himself,&#xD;
b all that men, hold sacred, to endeavor to be worthy of&#xD;
th trust thus reposed. The bright moonlight fell full in&#xD;
hi face; and, from behind a pillar against which she&#xD;
1 ned, Qertrud~ could see that he was flushed and&#xD;
h ggard. This pained her: for she knew, if the habit&#xD;
hidi was growing upon him could be broken, that a&#xD;
brilliant future awaited him; but 'if persisted in, that it&#xD;
would lead inevitably to his ruin.&#xD;
The young wife, who stood by her s!de, did not seem&#xD;
to have ammy apprehensions, though, for her face was&#xD;
beaming with joy and pride.~ This only lasted, however,&#xD;
while her husband was speakingg, and when he ceased,&#xD;
she gave a sigh and sat down, as if from weakness or&#xD;
fatigue. Judge Bak5 and two or three others followed&#xD;
Clifford in short but appropriate speeches, and after the&#xD;
usual hurrahing and music, the crowd dispersed, leaving&#xD;
the guests to the customary enjoyments of such occasions.&#xD;
Oddly enough, Mrs. Troup and Gertrude were left to en-&#xD;
tertain each other most of the evening; for, notwitf~-&#xD;
standing the autumn air was chilly, they both declined&#xD;
going into the parlor or dining-room, w ere, doubtless,&#xD;
the merriment that existed was to be attl4buted to~ rare&#xD;
wines, and the goo~i feeling consequent upon success.&#xD;

&#xD;
"So you like our little town?" Gertrude was saying.&#xD;
"Yes," answered Mrs. Troup; "for although I have&#xD;
seen comparatively little of the people, yet that little has&#xD;
been ~'ery kind and pleasant."&#xD;
" Y s, they are the dearest, best people in the world,,&#xD;
aild uniformly kind and appreciative. I regret to hear&#xD;
you have not been well."&#xD;
"You are very kind; but I am going home soon, and&#xD;
I think that will cure me.&#xD;
"You have not been home since your marriage?"&#xD;
"Why, what a hero! for, do you know, I think it must*&#xD;
require a. great deal of courage to be alone amongst&#xD;
strangers so long, with only your husband for a friend,&#xD;
and he almost a stranger, too."&#xD;
"Well, I suppose we ml~ght think so; but I'm not very&#xD;
courageous, and yet I've gotten along very nicely." And&#xD;
tinis these two women~ exchanged the ijsual and inevitable&#xD;
platitudes common to their sex; while th&amp;amp; bitter thought,&#xD;
"he loves her," intruded itself upon th~ wife, and, Ger-&#xD;
trude wondered if they were happy, never dreaming that&#xD;
the wee, pale woman, who sat opposite her, knew all2~&#xD;
Such is life; and thus do we try, but all in' vain, to dis-&#xD;
cover the inmost thoughts of each other6 There was a&#xD;
pause in the conversation, which was interrupted by a&#xD;
familiar voice saying:&#xD;
"Ah! Virginia, I was in search of you.. how do you&#xD;
feel ?"&#xD;
"Fatigued;" and as he did not speak to Gertrude, she&#xD;
said, "here is your old friend, Miss Lawrence."&#xD;
"Why, Miss Gertrude!" (shaking hands.) "I have&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
not had the pleasure of s.eein~ you since your v~turn.&#xD;
AIlow~ me to welcome you home~"&#xD;
"Thank you; I'm. really glad to get back once more."&#xD;
"But you had a pleasant visit?"* N&#xD;
"Oh, yes; very quiet, but. very pleasant."&#xD;
"I must bid you 'good-night,' now, Miss Lawre~e%",&#xD;
said Mrs. Troup, "for I fear I have already taxed my&#xD;
strength too much."&#xD;
"I hope not; I'm sure. Good-night;" and they shook&#xD;
hands, after the conventional mo.de,&#xD;
As they were leaving, Gertrude said tQ Clifford:&#xD;
"Can you tell r~ie where I can find. Judge Baker, for&#xD;
I must be going too."&#xD;
"Are you alone. ~"&#xD;
~' Then I will see you home in a moment; as soon as.~ I&#xD;
see Mrs. Troup to her room."&#xD;
~' Thank you, no; I will not trouble you; and, if Judge&#xD;
Baker is engaged, I. do not mind running across. the street.&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
"But you must not;" and leading his wife away, he&#xD;
said, '1711 be back in a moment."&#xD;
She felt that it: was wrong to accept his escort, and it&#xD;
was ao'ainst her judgment to do so; bat~ what else could&#xD;
do without seeming rude?&#xD;
And by the time she ha4 bidden Judge and Mrs~ Ba-&#xD;
ker." good-night," Cliffod. was at her side, saying:&#xD;
"I am ready;" and taking his arm, they. went silently&#xD;
down the moonlit avenue, and. out into the street. A&#xD;
short walk, and they wore at Gertrude's. home, without&#xD;
exchanging a word.&#xD;
"Qood~nicrht" said Gertrude. "I'm much obliged to&#xD;

&#xD;
I BESEECn YOU.&#xD;
&#xD;
you for ~seeing me home;" and her extended hand was&#xD;
grasped so tightly as to make it painful.&#xD;
"Gertrude, I hear you are to be married to Paul Max-&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"You can hear many things, if you'll only listen."&#xD;
"Is it true?"&#xD;
"It is not."&#xD;
"You declare?" in an excited tone.&#xD;
"I declare, upon my ~honor, it is false," she answered&#xD;
with dignity. Then releasing her hand, which he bad&#xD;
held unconsciously, he said, with great earnestness:&#xD;
"Gertrude, I beseech you not to mai'ry him;" and the&#xD;
flush deepened on his brow, and the odor of liquor on his&#xD;
breath was wafted into the face of his fair histene~r.&#xD;
"Why need you make such an unnecessary request? ~'&#xD;
"Because I would save you the misery I daily endure."&#xD;
"Why do you talk this way, Clifford? Why can you&#xD;
not be happy with your wife? She is lovely, an din&#xD;
every respect worthy of your affection."&#xD;
More's the, pity! and do not think I am more unhappy&#xD;
for myself than for her, for with her' woman's instinct&#xD;
she suspects something is wrong, although she does not&#xD;
know it. i hate myself for the injury I have done her,&#xD;
and I know that there is nothing but misery in store for&#xD;
both of us."&#xD;
"But, Clifford, you should make it the study of youi&#xD;
life to render her happy, and if you have wronged her,&#xD;
the duty you now owe is doubly 'binding."&#xD;
"I know it-I feel that every word you speak is true.&#xD;
But if you were compelled to 'live with a person *daily,&#xD;
whom you did nojt love, you would then understand how&#xD;
loathsome that companionship will become;" and sitting&#xD;
&#xD;
I BESEECH YOU.              191&#xD;
down upon the steps, he looked away into the moon-&#xD;
lio'ht.&#xD;
"Bat you should reject these feelings as disloyal, and&#xD;
if possible, cultivate a cheerful resignation to what you&#xD;
cannot avert."&#xD;
"flow easy to talk, but how hard to do!"&#xD;
Then there was silence for a few moments, and corn-&#xD;
* prehen ding that it was neither right to encourage this&#xD;
accidental and most unexpected visit, nor the expression&#xD;
of such sentiments, Gertrude said:&#xD;
"Clifford, if IL could do anything for~ you, ~you know&#xD;
how gladly I would do it; but as IL cannot, I think it best&#xD;
for me to say good-night;" and again she extended her&#xD;
hand to him.&#xD;
Arising and taking it, he said rather reproachfully, for&#xD;
men are over-sensitive when drinking:&#xD;
"So you send me away, do you?"&#xD;
"Yes, because I think it is bett&amp;amp; for you, better for&#xD;
your wife, and better for me, that this interview shall not&#xD;
be prolonged;" and clasping her hand in both of his,~ he&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Gertrude, I beseech you again not to marry Paul&#xD;
Maxwell, for unless you love him, you. will be utterly&#xD;
wretched."&#xD;
"1 have no idea ~f marrying any one, Clifford; so&#xD;
do not give yourself any solicitude on my account. But&#xD;
let me beseech you, as a friend, not to yield to the habit&#xD;
which is already growing upon you at such a fearful&#xD;
rate!"&#xD;
"lilt doesn't matter what IL do. IL have lost all ambition,&#xD;
and I have no future."&#xD;
"And is all your pride gone too?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="198-199" xml:id="VAC8257-00000099"/>&#xD;
I BE~S1M~CII Y00.                                                             I BESI~ECH YOU.                   I9f~&#xD;
&#xD;
~" What is pride oranything else wheii one iswretched?"&#xD;
"Oh! Clifford, you degrade your manhood by yielding&#xD;
to a feeling which you should struggle with all your&#xD;
might to overcome. And remember, disappohitment is&#xD;
the common lot of man, and you are not the first or only&#xD;
one whose hopes have failed to be realized."&#xD;
* "Gertrude, I know all this; and had I not committed&#xD;
the unpardonable. crime of marrying that innocent child,&#xD;
I should be strong and ready to battle with any fate.&#xD;
But that act hangs like a dead weight about me, and&#xD;
~ems dragging me dow~ to ruin."&#xD;
"But it doesn'tTelieve you from the solemn obligations&#xD;
you took upon yourself when you married her. You are&#xD;
her husband, and she is your wife, just the s~xne as if you:&#xD;
loved her, and sympathy for her unfortuii~te condition&#xD;
should make you inor~ punctilious than ever in the dis~&#xD;
charge of your duty."&#xD;
"Who says I do not do my duty as a hn~baimd?"&#xD;
" I do," was the feadess answer of ~th~ woman who&#xD;
bad seen all the lI~Yrr(ws of a drunkard's life portrayed hi&#xD;
her father's terrible career; "for no man can do his duty&#xD;
to any one or an~4hing who is constantly under the influ~&#xD;
ence C4 liq3ior."&#xD;
Stung to the quick by these words, and springing to&#xD;
his feet, he said excitedly:&#xD;
"No man dare speak ~ to me!"&#xD;
asawotnan and a friend I dare do it~ and it is&#xD;
with the hope of a~rousing that chivalry in your breast,&#xD;
which I know is only deadened by the base poiscm which&#xD;
~ou ~ailydrink2'&#xD;
Resuming his seat upon the steps, he said not a word;&#xD;
lint buried his face in his hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
Then t1i~ heroic girl, seeing that he was at last&#xD;
touched, knelt beside him, and said:&#xD;
"Clifford, you know ~ou feel that I am right. IDo not&#xD;
turn a deaf ear to what I &amp;amp;ay, but determine now, th is&#xD;
moment, to. abandon a habit which must bring upon its&#xD;
victims, at last, ruin and degradation. Promise me that&#xD;
you will henceforth devote yourself to the happiness of&#xD;
your wife and to the cultivation of those talents which&#xD;
you undoubtedly possess."&#xD;
Taking his hands from his face, and turning around,&#xD;
he regarded the beautiful leader at his side with a feel..&#xD;
ing of reverence, as he said:&#xD;
"Gertrude, your advice deserves the highest respect;&#xD;
not more for the unflinching friendship it reveals, than&#xD;
for the nobility of sentiment which has prompted it. I&#xD;
will try and do what you have asked, and God knows, if&#xD;
I am reformed, I shall owe it all to you. Good-night."&#xD;
"Good-night, and may God help you;" then shaking&#xD;
bands, they parted. Tie, to return to the desolation of&#xD;
his wife's chamber, and she, to return thanks for the~&#xD;
strength which had been given her to speak those words&#xD;
of counsel.&#xD;

Ol-JAPTER XXX.&#xD;
WELL, PAUL?&#xD;
ELL, Paul, what does she say?"&#xD;
"She says she misses m&amp;amp;terribly," rep lied the&#xD;
young student~ while an iptense smile of satis-&#xD;
faction lit' up his manly face.&#xD;
"Misses you terribly?" repeated ~he master of "Pleas-&#xD;
ant Retreat," while looking over the inevitablee paper.&#xD;
"Those are her words, sir," again ~'~d&#xD;
too happy to dwell upon the subject.  Paul, as if only&#xD;
"Well, that's not so bad; indeed, if I were in your&#xD;
place, I should consider them exceedii~gly encouraging."&#xD;
"Young ladies are so' capricious, '~ir, that I think it&#xD;
safer to take them by contraries."  ~&#xD;
"Gertrude is not capricious, and she certainly is less&#xD;
of a coqnette than any woman I ever $aw. Take for ex-&#xD;
ample her conduct while here. Wh$r, sir, nine womei~.&#xD;
out of ten would have encouraged yo~u to' mak~ love to&#xD;
them, just for pastime or conquest, even if their feelings.&#xD;
had not been enlisted."&#xD;
"I hope what you say is true, sir."&#xD;
"nut you doubt it," taking up another paper. "Wait&#xD;
until you see more of the world, and you will then&#xD;
know what Ii ~say is true. But what about your Western&#xD;
trip!"&#xD;
"I have almost abandoned it, sir."&#xD;
Sensible boy! Besides, going West to find ready-&#xD;
&#xD;
made fortunes iS chasing an ideal anyhow, for a man&#xD;
who 5ucc~~ds honestly must be content to do it by honest&#xD;
strokes. It is better so, for then economy will take care&#xD;
of what manly labor provides, while money that is easily&#xD;
made is spent as recklessly; and it is not uncommon to&#xD;
see the precarious owner of such unstable fortunes fight~&#xD;
ing both remorse and poverty in the evening of life.&#xD;
~o, boy, stay in Georgia, for with her industrious, active&#xD;
population, and her great internal resources deveh)ped, she&#xD;
is obliged to become one of the first States in the Union,&#xD;
and there's no need for young men to seek a better open-&#xD;
ing elsewhere."&#xD;
"Your advice is always wise, sir, and I am honored to&#xD;
be the object of your interest."&#xD;
"Are you quite ready for your examination?"&#xD;
"I believe so, sir, except a few little points about which&#xD;
I should like to consult you this morning if you can spare&#xD;
me the time."&#xD;
"Certainly, certainly; come into the Study, and we'll&#xD;
~ee what it is;" and while they go in for a consultation,&#xD;
we will wend our footsteps elsewhere. Unwillingly, it&#xD;
may be; but an author must go forward, no matter how&#xD;
much he would like to rest, no matter how much his&#xD;
heart aches over scenes upon which he must look, but&#xD;
from which he would turn away if it were possible.&#xD;

HE glorious . month of October went by without&#xD;
rniy 'incident&#xD;
Only think of it!  notein onr little world.&#xD;
Superb days, gorgeous forests, bracing air, 1na~gniflcent&#xD;
6tinsots, summer dying, and no one seemed to ~eare&#xD;
That i~, noue '~f ~our immediate friends, Lor th~y were&#xD;
all too busy with themselves to stud~ the beauties of nat-&#xD;
ure.&#xD;
&amp;amp; :the'thirt~one days c~f autumn-time ~were gone, and&#xD;
~ear1y in the month of November 'the good mothers at&#xD;
"Mossy Creek" and the "Manor," with a bevy of colored&#xD;
assistants, were turnitig the two housesinsideout, in an-&#xD;
ticipation of. an ~early visit from their ~children, for the&#xD;
~uceessfnl representative was to spend a ~few days at&#xD;
home,. before proceeding to the Capitol. Such a dusting&#xD;
* a~d scouring, and washui~g of window; and putting 'down&#xD;
carpets, and ~baking cake; .fand making pickles, etc., etc.,&#xD;
had been rarely seen; 'but the expected ~i~itors were held&#xD;
in high esteem at eachii'espective place, and the fatted&#xD;
calf 'had been killed in honor of their coming.&#xD;
At length the appointed day arrived, the carriages had&#xD;
been sent to the city, and as the sun went down Mr, and&#xD;
Mrs. Troup walked through the, park to the lodge gate to&#xD;
speak to their children, e~ ya&amp;amp;~ant, for of course they&#xD;
would go on to "Mossy Creek" for the first night.&#xD;
&#xD;
~1LUNG TH~ FATTIW CALF.&#xD;
&#xD;
~2O3&#xD;
&#xD;
The father and mother looked older than when we last&#xD;
saw them; the wrinkles had deepened upon the face of&#xD;
the one, the hair of the other had grown grayer, and as&#xD;
they walked back and forth in the grass, they were sad&#xD;
and silent.&#xD;
Mr. Troup was not thinking of his son's welfare, though,&#xD;
for he was in trouble about money, as. usual, and was&#xD;
puzzling his brain to 'kndw how he could again apply to&#xD;
Clifford for assistance.&#xD;
how different with the mother! She was wondering&#xD;
her son was happy, and if he was doing his whole duty&#xD;
to his~yormg wife; for she felt that she could endure see-&#xD;
ing her daughters mistreated by other men, rather than&#xD;
have a son whom she had reared disloyal or indifferent to&#xD;
the woman he had married.&#xD;
A bank of purple clouds, flecked with crimson, and&#xD;
gold, stretched across the western sky, and as the fading&#xD;
sunbeams fell upon the silent couple, the rumble of&#xD;
wheels startled them. Exchanging a glance with his wife,&#xD;
Mr. Troup said:&#xD;
"They are coming!" and w.ith these words they both&#xD;
stepped o~itside the gate.&#xD;
A moment afterwards, the carriage stopped, and affe~-&#xD;
tionafe greetings were mutually exchanged.&#xD;
The kisses and embraces over, Mr. Troup stood upon&#xD;
the carriage-step talking to Virginia, while Clifford's arm.&#xD;
lovingly enfolded his mother, who was saying to him&#xD;
anxiously:&#xD;
"You. are not well, my boy."&#xD;
"Oh, yes; very well, but a . little out of sorts," he an-&#xD;
swered, with an attempt at a~sinile.&#xD;
"And Virginia looks wretchedly. What is the matter.&#xD;
with her?"&#xD;

&#xD;
KILLING THE FATTED CALF.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The poor child is homesick, I think! We will both&#xD;
'be all right now in a few days; will we not, Virginia ?"&#xD;
"What is it, Clifford? I do not understand."&#xD;
"Mother says we both look so miserably, and I said to&#xD;
her as we were only homesick that we would soon be all&#xD;
right. Will we not?"&#xD;
"I hope so," with a sigh, a drooping of the eyes, and a&#xD;
quivering of the lips.&#xD;
"indeed I trust so," said the mother anxiously; "and re-&#xD;
member, my daughter, that as soon as they can spare you&#xD;
from 'Mossy Creek' we will claim you at the 'Manor."'&#xD;
"You are Very kind," said the little pale wife, in that&#xD;
soft, sweet voice of hers,." and of course I expect to di-&#xD;
vide my time with you, if I am well enough."&#xD;
" But I will nurse you so-tenderly, and we will all try&#xD;
and cure you if you will come to us. Will we not, Mr.&#xD;
Troup?'?&#xD;
"Indeed 'we will," added the father tenderly, for even&#xD;
the Jove of money was not sufficient to overwhelm the&#xD;
chivalry that was innate in his breast.&#xD;
Virginia did not trust' herself to make a reply, for the&#xD;
tears stood in her eyes; and to hide her confusion, Clifford&#xD;
hurried to say:&#xD;
"She'll be over soon, and ~as it is getting late, we will&#xD;
say good-evening, not 'good-by,' for I will see you in the&#xD;
morning, mother;" and after an affectionate leave-taking,&#xD;
the carriage drove on.&#xD;
What a sad burden it bore, we alone can realize who&#xD;
have loved, who have suffered, who have been disappoint~&#xD;
ed, and who 'have laid up treasures, but to see them&#xD;
snatched away. Virginia sat over in one corner weeping&#xD;
the tears which 'would not be forced back, and Clifford&#xD;
&#xD;
sat in the other corner, silent and miserable. Silent, be-&#xD;
cause he could not console; miserable, not so much for&#xD;
himself as for the woman whose happiness he had&#xD;
~vrecked. For his instinct told him she knew something&#xD;
was wrong, although no hint ~f the fatal secret had ever&#xD;
escaped her lips. And thus it was that the trusting child&#xD;
who, a few short months before, had the paternal&#xD;
roof a happy bride, now returned to it a crushed and&#xD;
heart-broken wife. An occurrence not so rare as the&#xD;
world imagines.&#xD;
No more would life be the same to her; and like little&#xD;
Christian martyr, she hoped to conceal the blow which&#xD;
was killing her from her parents, knowing full well that&#xD;
their hearts would bleed with hers, and their hopes le&#xD;
buried in a common tombf The wife suffered scarcely&#xD;
more than the husband thouo'h for an honorable xian&#xD;
must feel it when he has betrayed the trust of so weak a&#xD;
thing as a confiding woman; and so keen was the remorse&#xD;
hi Clifford's heart,- that he would freely have given his&#xD;
life if he had never taken the fatal step which bound him&#xD;
to Virginia Dearing. Her sobs became more intense as&#xD;
they neai~ed her childhood's happy home; and when driv-&#xD;
ing through the park, which was illuminated with bon-&#xD;
fires upon stands, Clifford folded her tenderly in his arms,&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
'"Virginia, for my sake, try and control yourself;" but&#xD;
the words were unheeded, and it had been as easy to&#xD;
force the tide back into the ocean ~as to check the flow&#xD;
of those tears which refused to be sent lj~ack into their&#xD;
briny bed.                         J&#xD;
The carriage stopped, and a moment later the poor&#xD;
homesick child was weeping upon her mother's breast,&#xD;

&#xD;
whfle the father stood -pressing her thin little hand in&#xD;
wondering silence. At first they thought it was the joy&#xD;
of coming home, but suddenly the mother's heart -sus-&#xD;
pected something else, and looking, at Clifford, she ~said&#xD;
-anxiously:&#xD;
"What is -the matter with my ~huld?"&#xD;
"She is not well, mother, and I hope is only nervous&#xD;
-from fatigue. Come, Virginia, let me take you into the&#xD;
house, where you can lie down, and y~u will -soon feel&#xD;
better;" and folding his arms around her, he would have&#xD;
'tarried her, but turning to her father, she said:&#xD;
"Let father take me."&#xD;
Yes, my precious, father -will.;" then, taking her in&#xD;
his arms, he lifted her into the house, and would have&#xD;
taken her into the 8itting-~rocnn, only she said-:&#xD;
"No, not here; take me to my own room, for I have&#xD;
come home to die."&#xD;
* "My darling, would you -break our hearts?" said the&#xD;
father folding her more closely in his arms, as he carried her&#xD;
tenderly up the stairs; then laying her on her snow-white&#xD;
bed, he kissed her pale, emaciated cheeks time and again.&#xD;
-shall father, forgive me, and mother, -don~t cry, for I&#xD;
be. with you a little while yet;" but the mother&#xD;
knelt by her side and wept as if her heart would break.&#xD;
The old family servants too stood around crying; and as&#xD;
Virginia recognized them, she became more composed,&#xD;
* and said gently:&#xD;
* "Why, there's Ohaney, and Luke, and Harriet, and&#xD;
Sallie~..How 4o you all do?" and each one eame forward&#xD;
and shook hands with "Miss Queen," as they called her.&#xD;
Then looking around and ~seeming to miss ~&amp;amp;ome one, she&#xD;
-said:&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
a -&#xD;
&#xD;
"Where's Mamnmy?"&#xD;
"Here, oliho," and the old black woman, who had&#xD;
nursed her from the very hour of her birth, now took her&#xD;
in her arms and said:&#xD;
"De good Lord be praised .for a-bringin' you back to&#xD;
us, honey, and We'll neber let you go-away from us- agin,&#xD;
poor chile!"&#xD;
* At these words, Mis. Daring looked up, and as the&#xD;
*     light fell full upon her daughters face, she was startled&#xD;
to fine it so thin and pale. Then turning to Clifford,&#xD;
who sat upon the foot of the bed, a silent -and wretched&#xD;
spectator of this heart-rending -scene; she said rather&#xD;
reproachfully:&#xD;
"What have you -done to our pet?"&#xD;
"Oh, mother, he has done nothing," said Virginia,&#xD;
quickly. "I have been sick for some time;" another&#xD;
stab for the husband.&#xD;
"And why -did you not let us know it, my darling, so&#xD;
that we could have brought you home?"&#xD;
"Because, father, I kept hoping to get better, sand&#xD;
besides, I did not like to leave -Olifford;" and as she&#xD;
looked lovingly at her husband, -he pressed her hand and&#xD;
kissed it.&#xD;
"Well, that is the feeling a wife~shonld have," said the&#xD;
motilei'; "but still we could have come to you, pet."&#xD;
"So I am here at ;las~, it doesn't matter, does it,&#xD;
Mamrny?" and she looked at her dear old nurse for - a&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"No, chile, an' we got y~u here now, we keep yen, .~&#xD;

young mistress.&#xD;
"Mistis, youse forgittin all 'bout supper, liaiu't yer,"&#xD;

suggested Chaney, the colored factotum, who walked&#xD;
around the establishment with all the dignity with which&#xD;
a huge bunch of keys dangling at her side inspired&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"You are quite right, Chaiiey; I had forgotten all about&#xD;
it. YQW can't go down, pet ~"&#xD;
"Xo~ no, mother. You all go; take Qlifford and leave&#xD;
Maminy with me. I want to talk to her about the tirne~&#xD;
I used to run away from her and make flutter mills down&#xD;
in the branch in the grove."&#xD;
"Just a&amp;amp; you say, love, and I'll send you up some sup.&#xD;

stantly Clifford slipped her hand through his arm and as-&#xD;
sisted her down the stairs as carefully and as gracefully&#xD;
as he always performed those little courtesies.&#xD;
Closing the door, Mammy sat down by the little,&#xD;
wretched wife, and while stroking her hair, said:&#xD;
"Now, honey, tell iMlammy, what is de matter wid her&#xD;
chile?"&#xD;
"Some other 'time, Mammy. I'm too, tired and sick&#xD;
now; but as I didn't wish father and mother to know it, I&#xD;
tried to talk ai.A laugh as long as they were in the room.&#xD;
Here now, let me put this pillow in your lap, and rest my&#xD;
head upon it, as I used to do, while you run your fingers&#xD;
through my hair."&#xD;
"Yes, honey, do jes as ye like, and ol4 Mammy will&#xD;
be happy;" and arranging the pillow as desii'ed, her&#xD;
young mistress rested her aching, throbbing head upon&#xD;
It.&#xD;
"There now, that feels so good, for my poor head aches&#xD;
to distraction."&#xD;

&#xD;
There now, try and go to sleep;" and for a little while a&#xD;
- profound silence reigned in th&amp;amp; room, for Virginia was&#xD;
exhausted, both l)y mental and physical suffering, and&#xD;
in addition to these, her heart was heavy with its own&#xD;
bitterness.&#xD;
Lying with closed eyes, she recalled the happy past,&#xD;
when, with the usual blindness of youth, the joys of the&#xD;
moment were ignored, and her heart went bounding forth&#xD;
to the untried future.&#xD;
Well , that future~came; there were but two periods in it&#xD;
-happiness and misery, and now the brief career was&#xD;
ended, and she seemed going down into that dark pit of an-&#xD;
guish which overwhelms th~ soul when we have loved and~&#xD;
*    lost.&#xD;
There was no resurrection-day for her; and recognizing&#xD;
*    the melancholy fact, she resigned herself to her hapless&#xD;
fate, with that martyr-like spirit which utters no murmur&#xD;
and is determined to bea~r its burden' unassisted. In the&#xD;
nobility of her soul, and in the spirit of sacrifice which&#xD;
gave her courage to endure, she thought it would be too&#xD;
cruel to break a father's heart and crush a mother's life&#xD;
because hers was blighted. Neither did she desire to add&#xD;
one iota to the unhappiness of him who had caused her&#xD;
ruin; for wretched as she was, she could but admire the&#xD;
loyal devotion which made her husband immolate himself&#xD;
for another, and in keeping her own lips sealed, she was&#xD;
but imitating his noble example.&#xD;
The feast which was brought to her room by three ser-&#xD;
vants, and which was served upon three respective large-&#xD;
sized silver waiters, was called by the unpretending name&#xD;
of "tea;" and as Chancy recommended eaj~i separate&#xD;

dish, "Miss Queen" regretted, more than words could&#xD;
tell, her inability to eat a single morsel.&#xD;
Only drinking a cup of tea, she strove to soothe Cha.&#xD;
ney's disappointment by saying:&#xD;
"Never mind, Chaney, I'll be better to-morrow, and&#xD;
then I can eat ~some of all these delicious things which&#xD;
you have so kindly prepared for me."&#xD;
"Lor', chile, II hopes so-~-kase wese bein a cooking'&#xD;
and a cleaning' and a fiXin' here for de last free weeks, jis&#xD;
for yer comm' and Mars Cliffort's."&#xD;
"Well, don't let 'Mars Cliffort' eat up everything from&#xD;
me, for I shoAl be better by and by, and then I shall waiit&#xD;
some of this nice fruit-cake."&#xD;
"Lor' sakes, chile, Mar~ Oliffort didn't touch no sup-&#xD;
:per neither. Neber seed sich folks. What be de mat-&#xD;

"Well, Ohaney, I am sick, and Clifford ~is tired, I sus-&#xD;
pect. We'll eat to-morrow"&#xD;
"I hopes so; for its jes frowin' away de raw material to&#xD;
cook for ye all;" and with these words she took her wait-&#xD;
ers down as she brought them up.&#xD;
"Now, honey, let 'Mammy' take all dese close off, and&#xD;
make ye comfcirtable."&#xD;
"As you say, Mammy;" and yielding to the suggestioji&#xD;
of her life-long nurse, she soon found herself vastly more&#xD;
at ease in a white wrapper than she was in her travelling&#xD;
suit.&#xD;
Supper over, the gentlemen walked out upon the gallery&#xD;
for a smoke, while the mother sought the chamber of her&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
IJutil far into the night did she and Mammy watch&#xD;
their precious charge; then, at Virginia's request, they left&#xD;

ChAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
SEVER!&#xD;
&#xD;
OON after breakfast, t~ie next morning, Clifford&#xD;
galloped over to the "iMianQr."&#xD;
The air was bracing, the forests gorgeous, the&#xD;
season beautiful; but he neither felt the one, nor saw the&#xD;
other, for the cause of his wife's depression and illness&#xD;
had dawned upon him suddenly; and by that intuition&#xD;
which sometimes gives us an insight where wQrds and&#xD;
actions would leave us groping in the dark, he now knew&#xD;
why her young life ~as going down to the tomb in its&#xD;
youth and freshness.&#xD;
Surely, the taking of an innocent life was sufficient,&#xD;
we think, to blind the eyes of even the most hardened;&#xD;
therefore, it does not seem strange that the beauties of&#xD;
Nature were all ignored on time morning in question.&#xD;
True, the life that was ebbing gradually away was not&#xD;
threatened by either ball or steel, but sometimes these&#xD;
would be merciful to the wife who finds lrome-.a desert,&#xD;
and liusband-a stranger.&#xD;
It had been a wretched night for both wife and hus-&#xD;
band, and although neither slept, they exchanged no&#xD;
word. Clifford's sleeplessness betrayed itself in eyes&#xD;
which were red and swollen. his cheeks, too, were&#xD;
flushed as the result of the panacea taken to "make him&#xD;
feel better," and the unmistakable odor upon his breath&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
NEVER!&#xD;
&#xD;
made his mother's heart beat with anxiety as she kissed&#xD;
him "good-morning," and said:&#xD;
"how is Virginia?"&#xD;
"Not well; the return home was too exciting for her,&#xD;
and she has slept none."&#xD;
"Poor child! I am sorry to hear it. And you, Clif-&#xD;
ford, you are not well either."&#xD;
"Nor never will be again, mother;" came in sad tones&#xD;
from lips that had to be compressed to hide their quiver~&#xD;
mo'&#xD;
"Don't talk fhat way, Clifford;" and ~ pained e~pres-&#xD;
sion rested up~n the mother's delicately cut features&#xD;
"You would have me tell the truth, mother?"&#xD;
~~Yes, my boy; but what is the matter?"&#xD;
Do you not know?" he asked, sadly. "Does not&#xD;
your mother's sympathy, added to your woman's instinct,&#xD;
tell you when your children are unhappy?"&#xD;
"Yes, my son, but it does not tell me the cause of&#xD;
that unhappiness. Come into my room, where we will&#xD;
be free from intrusion, and tell me all;" and taking his&#xD;
hand, she led him along with her, as in the olden time.&#xD;
Entering her chamber, she locked the door, and Clifford&#xD;
threw himself, with a sigh, upon a lounge, after the boy-&#xD;
ish custom of days that were gone. Sitting down by him,&#xD;
his mother stroked his hair, and said:&#xD;
"Now, my precious boy, tell me what is the matter?"&#xD;
"I am wretched-utterly wretched!"&#xD;
"What makes you so unhappy?"&#xD;
lie hesitated some time, as if dreading to speak the&#xD;
words which faltered upon his lips. Then half-raising&#xD;
himself up, and resting upon his elbow, he looked his&#xD;
mother hi the face, and said solemnly:&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="214-215" xml:id="VAC8257-00000107"/>&#xD;
2141&#xD;
&#xD;
£ "She i&amp;amp; dy!" 'tha~i sank baek upon the lounge&#xD;
with a groan, and covered his. face with his hands.&#xD;
"Oh, Clifford!" came from the mother's lips, and&#xD;
bowing her head upon.~his bosom, she wept.&#xD;
Both were too wretched to talk, for their consciences&#xD;
were still fresh. and ~piire~ and they realized, in all its her..&#xD;
ror, wbat it was to sacrifice the happiness, and perhaps&#xD;
the life, of a human being. Some time passed by, and&#xD;
then putting his arm around his mother's neck, and draw-&#xD;
ing her to him, Clifford said;&#xD;
"And mother, he who has caused all this misery will&#xD;
suffer. for it before he dies?'&#xD;
"Oh, my son, do not make any threats against your-2'&#xD;
"I make no threats,." sa~id. Olifford arising; "but when&#xD;
a man utterly. disregards the feelings of his fellow-creat.&#xD;
ures, it. will be brought hack to him, sooner or later"&#xD;
"Bat your wife, you hava not. mistreated her? uch&#xD;
a thing would be impossible for my 8Ofl.~&#xD;
"I have not dealt~ her blows, but I have broken her&#xD;
heart, I have never sought her except from ditty and&#xD;
respect, and py lips have never framed themselves to call.&#xD;
her by. any dearer name than .' Virginia;' and do you&#xD;
think she does not know, she does not feel insti~etively.&#xD;
that soiiiethingis wrong?&#xD;
"I would have neglected her shamefully,~had I yielded&#xD;
to my feelings, and had not the chivalric, blood of the&#xD;
Troops and the Bakers forced. me tQ .a different courses&#xD;
"But what are the IuQSV assiduous attentions worth to&#xD;
any ~ unless, they. are prompted by l~ve?"&#xD;
The ioor heart-broken mother had no time to reply,&#xD;
for a~ rap at .tha doors ended the interview, and entering,&#xD;
Mr. Clifford Troup, Sr.,. said:&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Goo4.morning, Clifford! I come t~ offer my congratm'&#xD;
nations, which I neglected to present in our hasty meet-&#xD;
mo' last evening."&#xD;
*     "I thank you~, sir, arid though I prize worldly honors&#xD;
but little, yet your congratulations are~gratifyiug."&#xD;
*     "What's this 'I hear about not pricing worldly honors?&#xD;
Such sentiments are unworthy ~of a Troup 1"&#xD;
~' But for the distinguished name I bear, sir, I should&#xD;
have been utterly indifferent as to the result of my elee-&#xD;
tion;" and the father winced as he comprehended some-&#xD;
thing must be wrong. Then, with an attempt at pleas-&#xD;
antry, the honorable father said, with a forced smile, and&#xD;
looking at the mother:&#xD;
"Why what has come over ~tlie boy?" Then turning&#xD;
to his son, he added: "A year ago you were buoyant and&#xD;
ambitious, now I find you depressed and indifferent."&#xD;
"True! because, a year ago, I was an honorable man;&#xD;
now, II am a betrayer, a perjurer, and, perhaps, a mur~&#xD;
dever."&#xD;
Liquor, as is known, has a different effect upon different&#xD;
temperaments, and while it makes some men silent, it&#xD;
makes others communicative. It ha&amp;amp; the latter effect&#xD;
upon Clifford, ai~d made him expose those things~ which&#xD;
in sober moments he would have held as too sacred to be&#xD;
spoken of at all. This must be the apology to the reader,&#xD;
for what may sometimes seem weak 'in a man, and better&#xD;
left unsaid. The mother sat weeping, and the father stx4&#xD;
regarding his son with scorn.&#xD;
lIe was rather surprised to hear him speak as he did,.&#xD;
for he had flattered himself that ki~ son's feelings could&#xD;
be crushed out or bought at will, as his own could be.&#xD;
lie was not so much astonished to hear it iiitinvated&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
NEVER!I&#xD;
&#xD;
that the wife felt betrayed, as he was to find his son af&#xD;
fected by such a trifling (?) thing as the heart-sickness&#xD;
of a woman, lie had fancied him strong enough and&#xD;
stern enough to resist snob an unimportant influence, and&#xD;
when he saw him absolutely yielding to it, he felt a kind&#xD;
of contempt for him. lie forgot for the moment how&#xD;
tenderly he had loved that boy's mother, not only for 'a&#xD;
year but for years after their marriage, and never had&#xD;
that love been supplanted until avarice entered his heart&#xD;
like a festering wound and poisoned his whole being.&#xD;
But while he stood in sneering silence, Clifford crossed&#xD;
the room, sat down by his mother, ~nd putting his arm&#xD;
around her, said:&#xD;
Li&#xD;
"Forgive me, dear mother if I have given you pain;&#xD;
but the confidence you have always allowed me, and your&#xD;
entire sympathy in all my feelings, naturally made me&#xD;
seek you when I was in trouble; and now that I am a&#xD;
man, I suppose I must forget my boyish ways, and rely&#xD;
upon myself instead of finding relief by pouring my sor-&#xD;
rows into your ear..&#xD;
"No, my boy, always come to me, tell me everything&#xD;
that troubles you, and if I cannot save you from suffering,&#xD;
I can at least give you my sympathy;" and pressing her&#xD;
lips to his fine brow, she kissed him, as a pledge of her&#xD;
earnestness.&#xD;
." Dear mother" was all he could say, and for a few&#xD;
minutes they sat looking down and thinking; then arising&#xD;
suddenly, and as if lie had forgotten something, Clifford&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"I must be going, for Virginia may miss me,. and as I&#xD;
can only stay a day or two, I must be with her as much&#xD;
as possible."&#xD;
&#xD;
NEygR I&#xD;
&#xD;
21?&#xD;
&#xD;
"Only a day or tWo?"&#xD;
"Yes; you know the Legislature meets next week.&#xD;
But you'll be over to-day?"&#xD;
" Yes! "&#xD;
"Oh, I forgot to say that Mrs. Dearing requests father&#xD;
and yourself to dine at 'Mdssy Creek' to-day."&#xD;
"Your mother can do as she likes, but I cannot leave&#xD;
home to-day;" and with these words the honorable father&#xD;
stalked grandly out of the room.&#xD;
"Well, I will see about it after I get there, Clifford, and&#xD;
if Virginia is well enough, perhaps&amp;amp; I will remain. My&#xD;
thanks to Mrs. iL~earino'"&#xD;
"All right; good-by;" and kissing her tear-stained&#xD;
face, he walked quickly from tl~e house, and, springing to&#xD;
his saddle, galloped rapidly dQwn the broad, ~'indingave-&#xD;
nue. - Much-to his surprise, he countered his father at~&#xD;
the lodge gate, and not feeling in a humor to talk, he&#xD;
would have bowed and passed on, but was arrested by&#xD;
this request:&#xD;
"A word with you, Clifford."&#xD;
"Certainly,, sir," said the son, lifting hi~ hate&#xD;
"I hate to apply to you again, but II am terribly in~ need&#xD;
of a few thousands, and if you could help me just this&#xD;
once, I will never trouble you again"&#xD;
What an abject appeal, and what abject things ~iioney&#xD;
will drive men to do; things which they would die rather&#xD;
than do from any other cause!&#xD;
"I regret that I cannot oblige you, sir, but upon my&#xD;
honor, it is impossible!" answered the son, respectfully&#xD;
but sternly.&#xD;
"Could not your wife get iL for you?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"I dare say she could and would, but never again will&#xD;
I ask her to do it."&#xD;
"Think, Clifford, it is your father who comes to you in&#xD;
his old age for assistance;" and resting one hand upon the&#xD;
pommel of the saddle, he looked the picture of despaii~&#xD;
Clifford's heart was touched, iiotwithstanding that father&#xD;
bad caused him so much suffering, but his resolution ~vas&#xD;
taken, and no power on earth could aite~ that resolve, so&#xD;
he said in a very determined tone:&#xD;
"Did I have the money, father, you should not wait to&#xD;
ask me for it, but to take another man's money and give&#xD;
him nothing in exchange for it but faithlessness to his&#xD;
child, is impossible! II cannot do it; do not ask it. What&#xD;
I make myself shall be yours, but more than this I can-&#xD;
not promise;" and lifting his hat, he bowed "good-&#xD;
morning," and galloped rapidly away, while .his father&#xD;
stood looking after him with an angry and disappointed&#xD;
scowl upon his handsome and striking face. And here&#xD;
we see, step by step, how surely and inevitably a man will&#xD;
go down the ladder of moral degradation, who ignores the&#xD;
laws of Nature, and sets at defiance the laws of God.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
A CHARMING PUPIL.&#xD;
F course, the rest of the world were in~rnotion ~&#xD;
during these sad scenes at the "Manor" and&#xD;
"Mossy Creek," and while they were being en-&#xD;
acted, our old friends from "Pleasant I~etreat ".were es&#xD;
tablishing themselves in a very handsome house in the&#xD;
gay capital.&#xD;
The novelty of everything soon wore off for Gertrude,&#xD;
and instead of resigning herself entirely to 1~he demands&#xD;
of fashionable life, her uncle si~iggested ~she should&#xD;
study music and French, which she did.&#xD;
Her beauty and freshness elicited admiration wher~&#xD;
ever she appeared, and she was acknowledged by the&#xD;
critics to ~be "the belle of the season."&#xD;
This was a distinguished preferment, for it seemed as&#xD;
if the jxtrterres of the world had furnished their most&#xD;
beautiful- flowers that winter to blossom in the gay bou-&#xD;
quet which lent its varied hues to make the capital more&#xD;
brilliant4han ever before. The Senator's~position at once&#xD;
introduced his niece into the best society, and the petit&#xD;
diiers and brilliant coteries which followed each other in&#xD;
quick succession at his own house, and over which she&#xD;
presided with so much ease and grace, were talked of as&#xD;
among the most delightful r~uniow~ of the seasoix This&#xD;

ing, united with congenial exchange of thought, was fitting&#xD;
her to be the companion of savant8 and 1Ut~rateurs.&#xD;
11cr uncle's pride in her was unbounded, and no won-&#xD;
der, for she was beautiful, accomplished, gifted and&#xD;
brilliant, admired and sought; and he yet hoped to see&#xD;
her married to some man whom she loved, and who&#xD;
would appreciate her in return. To this end he watched&#xD;
her when she did not suspect him; for this cause, he was&#xD;
pained at the indifference she manifested towards all her&#xD;
visitors~ however, there was one whose society she&#xD;
seemed to prefer to the others, and as a natural conse-&#xD;
quenee the uncle gave no encouragement to the attentions.&#xD;
of the fortunate individual, for when, since the world&#xD;
began, were ever uncle and niece, or father and daughter&#xD;
en rapport regarding a suitor? True, the young man&#xD;
was a French Count, an attacked of the French L~gation,&#xD;
and some papas and 'some mammals would have died in the&#xD;
attempt to secure such a prize.&#xD;
But the lion. Reuben Hall was not only antagonistic&#xD;
to the nobility by birth, but from principle, considering&#xD;
an American Rudolph worth all the kings and emperors&#xD;
of Europe. This he not only felt but acted, giving the&#xD;
preference at all times to his young countrymen who were&#xD;
striving by their 6ww'exertions to raise themselves to some&#xD;
elevated position. Of course, he was always polite to&#xD;
foreigners, and extended to them the hospitalities of his&#xD;
house, but he had no ambition to marry his niece to any&#xD;
one but. a deserving countryman~ thinking the highest&#xD;
honor an American woman could enjoy was to be the wife&#xD;
ef a true Axie~ie~m..&#xD;
When Gertrude told him that Count IYAuvergne had&#xD;
kindly offered to assist her wit~h her French by conversing&#xD;

with her an hour each day, he was silent ai~d rather ap~&#xD;
prehensile, while his usual infallibilIty on the subject of&#xD;

Yes, that was it-two heads bending together over&#xD;

thought the Count, when he said one morning, in the&#xD;

"Speak in English, now, for the lesson is ended; and&#xD;

"Have no fears, mademoiselle; fork I think it would&#xD;

"Who said anything about hearts ? '?~ she said, going to&#xD;
the window to look out at the gay promenadess who&#xD;
thronged, the avenue.&#xD;
"I," answered tIme Count, at her e~r, and while she&#xD;
looked out, he found sufficient occupation in studying, for&#xD;
th~ millionth time, her beautiful pm ~lile, until his pro-&#xD;
longed gaze brought a blush to her dtiee1~s, and turning,&#xD;
she said:&#xD;
"We've had no music this morning.!"&#xD;
"Pm at your service," with a graceful bow.&#xD;
"Come, then, we'll try that exquisite duet of Men~&#xD;
delssoJ'mn's, 'iii would that my love;"' and leading the 'way&#xD;
to the' piano, she played the prelude; and they began:&#xD;
he, in a delicious tenor, she, in a rich, pure sopraio,&#xD;
which would have made her a Divc~ before' the footlights.&#xD;
And 50 they loved music?&#xD;
Another attraction, another bond of sympathy; for a&#xD;
handsome man , who sings is 'to all women-even those&#xD;
who do not love the immortal art-4he most fascinating&#xD;
creature in tIme world.&#xD;
Let fathers and umicles and inammas be correspondingly&#xD;

~The duet concluded, the Count leaned gracefully on&#xD;
the piamio, and never looked so handsome iii his life, ~as&#xD;
when he ~aid, in accents soft amid tender:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now sing me just one little song."&#xD;
Didn't we say lie was handsome before ~ If we didn't,&#xD;
we meant to; and another thing we ~wanted to say was&#xD;
that he was of Italian descent on the maternal side;,&#xD;
hence his love of music, and his soft, dreamy, black eyes&#xD;
and poetic nature.&#xD;
No, lie was not one of your. volatile Frenchmen, for&#xD;
had he been, Gertrude would never have been attracted&#xD;
to him. On the contrary, he had a depth of feeling,&#xD;
which, as yet, no plummet-line had sounded; 1)ut that the&#xD;
far-off chords had been struck latterly seemed beyond a&#xD;
doubt; and if they hadn't been, that they Tould be,&#xD;
seemed quite inevitable, just now. Looking dyer son~e&#xD;
music, and humming a sweet little air, as if t&amp;amp; herself,&#xD;
Gertrude looked up finally, and said:&#xD;
"What shall I sino' 2"&#xD;
"Your selection will make me happy," was the gallant&#xD;
rejoinder..&#xD;
"Ab, Count, you do say such sweet things!"&#xD;
With such inspiration, how can I help it?"&#xD;
Thanks expressed in a glance from a pair of glorious&#xD;
eyes, then a piece of music spread upon the rack by ta..&#xD;
peering fingers which were pink as roses.&#xD;
What is it? "Pen~ez d rnoi I"&#xD;
These words on the, title-page:&#xD;
"Aved 1e8 regards de Uount D'Auvergn~e."&#xD;
A prelude, of course, then in a soft, low voice she sahg,&#xD;
while aii occasional glance at him whb sighed and turned&#xD;
the leaves, made him feel "Oh, delicious it is!"&#xD;
And we should rather say it was! Look at the pict~&#xD;

Where was it all to end?&#xD;
Did any one ever stop in just such a delirium of ecstasy&#xD;
to ask any question-but one?&#xD;
The moment was propitious-it was going-would it&#xD;

ti~h, but she didn't mean to he. What woman ever did?&#xD;
Her heart was safe, and the Count's ought to be! At&#xD;

no. What woman ever did acknowledge that she ever&#xD;

The song was ended.&#xD;
Sileklce by two. Her fingers still pressed the last&#xD;

her eyes sought those of her visitor; his face was flusl~ed,&#xD;
his eyes 'full of a new light which startled the' lair givl:&#xD;

His soliloquy w~s short, if damning; for at last Ger-&#xD;

how much she wished to linger at her mirror, exchanging&#xD;
admiring glances with herself, she returned in an incred-&#xD;

"Are you ready?"&#xD;
"S'il vous ylc4t?" and there was a glove to fasten--&#xD;
another trying situation for a man in love. Then a&#xD;

Oh 'these women, how deliciously tormenting they can&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
THE RIVALS.&#xD;
lIE few sweet autumn days when Clifford lin-&#xD;
gered so tenderly by her side, and read to her&#xD;
from her favorite authors, were now but a mem-&#xD;
ory, but treasured, oh, so fondly I Yes, treasured, for in&#xD;
those~ days she almost believed he loved her; lie was so&#xD;
kind; sothoughtfiil, so considerate, and Heaven help him&#xD;
for ever being anything else. It always was against his&#xD;
nature to be so, but love is stronger than chivalry, and&#xD;
while the latter can be forced, the former never can be,&#xD;
no matter how reason~ and judgment, and society may&#xD;
shape the conduct.&#xD;
What a little thing it is to be kind-to speak a gen-&#xD;
tIe word; to give a look of sympathy! and yet, how often&#xD;
are they withheld, even though we know how much hap-&#xD;
piness they yield to others. None of us are, too poor to&#xD;
cast these blessings upon the pathway of -onir fellow-&#xD;
creatures, and instead of scowling and freezing all the&#xD;
kindliness out of our hearts,. let our smiles and cheery&#xD;
words be scattered broadcast, as well upon those who&#xD;
xieed them, as upon those who seem to need them not,&#xD;
~or Qftener than we dream, a laughing face may hide a&#xD;
bleeding heart.&#xD;
Yes; the happy days were' gone forever, and the young&#xD;
wife buried her grief so deep within her breast, that not&#xD;
even the searching eyes of her doting parents could dis.&#xD;
&#xD;
TUE RIVALS~&#xD;

&#xD;
cover the disease that was gnawing at her heartstrings,&#xD;
and stopping the very fountains of her youth. Sh~ came&#xD;
~otter~ng down staji's with Mamrny's assistance, and b&amp;amp;&#xD;
cause she was cheerful, they deemed her happy; because&#xD;
they were hopeful, they considered. her out of danger~&#xD;
The idea of surrendering their only treasure to the grim&#xD;
monster wa~ never thought of, and indeed, who ever&#xD;
thinks of this painful subject, but to banish it?&#xD;
So can even the eyes of love be deceived, by one who&#xD;
has the moral courage and the heroism to be~r 9ie~ cross&#xD;
alone, by one who loves others more than self, and whose&#xD;
chief desire is to save those dear ones pain.&#xD;
Except an occasional visit from the Troups and some&#xD;
other neighbors, the trio at "Mossy Creek" we~e rarely&#xD;
invaded, and one day was so much like another, that but&#xD;
for Mr. iDearing's diary~ they could never have been told&#xD;
apart. Vii~ginia beguiled the tedium by embroidering a&#xD;
pair of slippers for a Christmas present for her husband,&#xD;
and could the tiny leaves and flowers which grew into&#xD;
life under her little pale fingersliave spoke, they wQuld&#xD;
have told a sad tale of bright hopes that had been woVen&#xD;
in their creation, and perhaps of a tear which had been&#xD;
dropped now and then, as these fond hoped were doomed&#xD;
to perish.&#xD;
Letters came regularly from the absent one, to cheer&#xD;
and comfort the little wife, with such comfort as it was;&#xD;
and through the papers she saw with pride that "Clifford&#xD;
Troup, Jr., was winning honors for himself and name, as&#xD;
he was considered beyond doubt the most brilE~nt de-&#xD;
bater in the House."&#xD;
Relieved ifrom the restraints of a home in which lie was&#xD;
not happy, and with the habit which seemed growing&#xD;

&#xD;
upon him, it was but natural to fear that Clifford would&#xD;
go into excesses. So far, nothing of the kind had oc-&#xD;
curred, for the relief of being alone-the necessity of not&#xD;
having to live a daily falsehood in the presence of an-&#xD;
other-helped him to bear what he could not conquer,&#xD;
instead of driving him to seek oblivion in the~poisoiiouS&#xD;
draught which kills both body and soul.&#xD;
Thus two mouths passed quickly away, and the sage&#xD;
legislators looked forward with delight, as they thought&#xD;
of the 1~olidays which were to be passed with the loved&#xD;
ones at home.&#xD;
Clifford, we regret to say, was an exception to this&#xD;
almost general rule, for although he tried to. imagine&#xD;
himself happy at the idea of returning to his wife, yet&#xD;
with the same feQling was singled one ot repugnance;&#xD;
and at that moment lie might have put the continent&#xD;
between himself and her whom he. had sworii to love,&#xD;
cherish, and keep, had not honor stepped between, and&#xD;
kept him somewhere within the bounds of duty.&#xD;
If there is a husband whose eyes shall light upon this&#xD;
page, who suffers this feeling of revolt upon repairing to&#xD;
his home, we say to lThn: "You have outraged the holy&#xD;
law of matrimony; for you have married from some&#xD;
other motive than that of love."&#xD;
Poor Virginia!" Wretched Clifford!~~&#xD;
The one deceived; the other deceiving ! Which wa~&#xD;
worse?&#xD;
Suffering for one; suffering and crime for the other.&#xD;
Two lives ruined! But what is a human life?&#xD;
A fearful gift from God,, or an insignificant b'~on&#xD;
which men barter for gold, and sell to the devil for&#xD;
worldly preferment?&#xD;

"Who appreciates that it is the former? How many&#xD;
consider it only the latter!&#xD;
While we have been reflecting, an unbroken stream of&#xD;
pleasure-seekers have been pouring in the direction of the&#xD;
Executive Mansion, which is beautifully illuminated, and&#xD;
thrown open for the last levee before the holidays. The&#xD;
gathering was large and brilliant; for Georgi~ then&#xD;
was represented by all that was best and noblest within&#xD;
her varied borders; and no one could have min&amp;amp;led in&#xD;
the gay throng, or received the courtesies .of th Chief&#xD;
Magistrate and his wife, without feeling proud ~o own&#xD;
himself a citizen of the Empire State of the Soutl4&#xD;
It was long before the days of scalawags and ~arpet-&#xD;
baggers and thieving governors, in a time wheA men&#xD;
were honest, and when they loved principle moi~e than&#xD;
money-if, indeed, the imagination has the power to&#xD;
drift back to such an ancient date. Could the festivities&#xD;
have ended here, it had been .well;. for then s~me of.&#xD;
Georgia's noblest sons would have returned t&amp;amp; their&#xD;
homes and constituents, at least as they came, and with-&#xD;
out the blemish upon their reputations which from that&#xD;
night would rest upon them forev~r. But there was to be&#xD;
a banquet at the Hotel, complimentary to th~ mem-&#xD;
bers of the legislature, and, judging from the has,~e with&#xD;
which the gentlemen escorted the ladies home, "a jolly&#xD;
good time" was in anticipation. Of course,"a jolly time,"&#xD;
for it was to be one of those entertainments from which&#xD;
ladies are excluded-" no restraints, you know "~--which&#xD;
means, "~I can drink just as much as I please," "and say&#xD;
just what I please, and no one~will be any the wiser."&#xD;
Granted! No one will be any the ~viser (?), but is there&#xD;
no mother, wife, sister, or daughter, to suffer by the degra-.&#xD;

nation of such conduct? No loving hearts to be l)ruised&#xD;
by such blows?&#xD;
Anathemas loud and deep, say we, upon those ca-&#xD;
rousals, more politely called banquets or suppers; xvliere&#xD;
men congregate without the restraining influence of&#xD;
women, and the odium of the public be upon those who&#xD;
give and encourage such entertainments; for we all know&#xD;
they are not given either for the purpose of benefiting&#xD;
or elevating mankind, but are, as a general thing, used as&#xD;
advertisements for some hotel proprietor, 01' to farther&#xD;
the interests of some clique or corp()ratW~n.&#xD;
*      Cheap wines and medicated liquors are the tempting&#xD;
beverages on such grand occasions; everybody is expected&#xD;
*   to get drunk, as a compliment to the host, and the man&#xD;
who fails to come up to the mark, in this particular, is set&#xD;
down either as unmanly, stupid, or "henpecked."&#xD;
Henpecked! a term of reproach that is applied to a&#xD;
man who respects his wife too much to make a brute of&#xD;
himself. Judging from the noise, the entertainment was&#xD;
at its height, and to call it Bedlam would be giving only&#xD;
a faint idea of the boisterous scene.&#xD;
Imagine five long tables the length of the immense&#xD;
dining-room, at which were seated as many hundred men,&#xD;
all talking, speaking, and clattering knives and forks at&#xD;
one time, and some conception of tho picture xiiay be had.&#xD;
At first, the toasts caine in regular order, one at a time,&#xD;
but as the men grew heated with wine and excited under&#xD;
the other influences surrounding them, as many as twentl&#xD;
or thirty occupied the floor at once.&#xD;
These together with the cheers of the listeners, who al-&#xD;
ternately cried: "Down with the Senator from C&#xD;
or "Mr. T---, the Representative from B-, li~s the&#xD;
&#xD;
floor;" or " Go it, Mr. D-," "We'll hear you thi'ough,&#xD;
Mr. S-.----," reminded ~ne of the lower regions, where, it&#xD;
is said, the demons occasionally revolt against the demands&#xD;
of his Satanic Majesty.&#xD;
And so the uproar and the drinking and the speaking&#xD;
and the talking increased, until the heat of the room be~&#xD;
came stifling, and there was a general stampede for the&#xD;
open air. Railroads being scarce in those days, many of&#xD;
the members of the General Assembiy had to reach their&#xD;
homes either by staging ox' private carriages, and as it&#xD;
was broad daylight when the banqueters left the ball of&#xD;
feasting, their conveyances were awaiting them. Amongst&#xD;
the crowd of vehicles was a handsome top-buggy, with a&#xD;
pair of spirited sorrel ponies attached to it, and evidently&#xD;
it was all the driver could do to keep them in check, for&#xD;
they pawed the earth, and in their impatience were eager&#xD;
to be off.&#xD;
"Aix, Jake, I was just looking for you;" and springing&#xD;
into the buggy, the speaker waved "good-by" to some&#xD;
friends who were with him, and giving the reins to his&#xD;
ponies, was off at lightning speed.&#xD;
"By Jove, if he drives that way, he'll break his neck!"&#xD;
said one of the men, looking after him.&#xD;
"Jake will take care of him, I hope.~~&#xD;
"What a pity, what a piby, he will drink so, for he is&#xD;
by far the most brilliant young fellow in' the State."&#xD;
"Better say what a pity he has such a fiend for a father,&#xD;
for it is he who has ruined the son."&#xD;
"Oh, you've heard the story!',&#xD;
"A love-affair, 'wasn't it?"&#xD;
"Yes; loved one WOman and married another."&#xD;

"But he will not throw himself away for that."&#xD;
"That's just what he's doing; but IL must seek some rest,&#xD;
and you?"&#xD;
"Will follow your example."&#xD;
"Meet me at twelve at the Capitol, in regard to that&#xD;
matter we were discussing last night."&#xD;
"1 will ;" and they parted.&#xD;
While they were talking, the subject of their remarks&#xD;
was giving not only the reins but the whip to horses&#xD;
which were regarded as the fastest in the country, and&#xD;
seeing how~ excited his master was, Jake said:&#xD;
* "Mars Clifford, better let me hab dem reins;" but the&#xD;
* proposition was answered with an oath, something very&#xD;
unusual for the elegant and polished Clifford, Jr., and&#xD;
Jako, the faithful, lapsed into trembling silence.&#xD;
Excited by the run, and maddened by the lash which&#xD;
had been dealt mercilessly, thQ horses at length became&#xD;
unmanageable, and as Clifford endeavored to check them&#xD;
by the bits, they reared and plunged, then darting off like&#xD;
lightning, ran against a tree which stood at an angle in&#xD;
the road. The shock smashed a fore..wheel, and then&#xD;
Clifford was dragged. over their heads, and for some dis-&#xD;
tance, before rekasing his hold upon the reins. Jake,&#xD;
in his fright, sprang from the buggy, whi~oh resulted in a&#xD;
broken leg and fractured skull; and together master and&#xD;
servant lay upon the high road, bleeding and insensible,&#xD;
while the maddened horses rushed on to their destruction.&#xD;
The road was not very, much frequented, but surely ~they&#xD;
will not be left alone to die. Even if the accident 'were&#xD;
the result of recklessness, and an utter disregard of life,&#xD;
God is always merciful, and surely He will send some&#xD;
good Samaritan that way to bind up the wounds of the&#xD;
&#xD;
wounded. Hark! there's a sound of wheels~ and another&#xD;
traveller approaches the scene of the terrible disaster.&#xD;
Lost in thought, though, he did not see the bleeding man&#xD;
until ,with his feet almost upon the body, the horse gave&#xD;
a snort and halted. Springing from his buggy, the stran~&#xD;
ger approached what appeared to be a dead mars, and&#xD;
turning him over, was shocked to find that it was his o4d&#xD;
rival, Clifford Troup. What a strange and fearful meet-&#xD;
ing; and as Paul Maxwell supported the head of the life~-&#xD;
less man, he thought to himself, "What is to be done ?"&#xD;
And indeed it was a question of importance, for' he&#xD;
was alone, and at least six or seven miles irom the&#xD;
nearest house or physician. To leave him to go for aid,&#xD;
was a revolting idea, although Paul could ~ no good of&#xD;
staying, and to move him might prove fatal. Then what&#xD;
was to be done? And as he bent above the still lifeless&#xD;
man,. and felt for a throb in the temples, he thought&#xD;
again: "What a strange meeting 1" Paralyzed by the&#xD;
unexpected shook, he sat holding poor Ojifford, and think-&#xD;
ing only "How strange !" After what seemed an age,&#xD;
'another traveller drove up, and after much consultation&#xD;
it was agreed that he should return to M-. and bring&#xD;
.a physician and a litter, so that the wounded man might&#xD;
be removed with as much comfort as possible to where&#xD;
he could receive the necessary attention. It was a long&#xD;
time to wait, but Paul was tnore than willing to do what-&#xD;
ever lay in his power for a sullering brother, what though&#xD;
lie did it with strange feelings in his heart. True, Olif-&#xD;
ford Troup had never harmed him-iudeed they were&#xD;
strangers to each other; but then they both loved the&#xD;
same woman, and that is an offence not easily. forgiven&#xD;
one man by another.&#xD;

&#xD;
Strange, isn't it, that this thing of h~ve has such a pow-&#xD;
erful influence over us all? People may laugh, they may&#xD;
sneer, they may try to dismiss the subject as unworthy of&#xD;
their thoughts, but those who laugh the loudest are gen-&#xD;
erally those who cannot for life or death get out of its&#xD;
troublesome coils. Those two hours of watching were&#xD;
weary enough, and in after years Paul remembered them&#xD;
as the dreariest hours of his life. But he held his lifeless&#xD;
burden as tenderly as though he had been a brother, in-&#xD;
stead of a rival; and he bathed his temples ~as gently as&#xD;
if they both didn't love the same woman. And then he&#xD;
thought he would like for him to be saved-he would&#xD;
like for him to live.&#xD;
For what? To be loved by her, and to love her?&#xD;
Then a shudder came over him and he thought-well-&#xD;
he thought- But it is too wicked; we cannot write&#xD;
it. At any rate he thought something that was very, very&#xD;
wicked, would be very nice. No, no, surely he didn't!&#xD;

Did you never wish a rival out, of the way? Once only&#xD;
did he open his eyes, and this was after Paid brought&#xD;
some water from the spring near by, and bathed his tem-&#xD;
ples. But it was a look of unconsciousness, a stare only;&#xD;
and then, with a moan, he sank back, while the blood&#xD;
flowed afresh from his arm and temple. A little far-&#xD;
ther ou poor Jake lay ii)Seflsible also, and not until&#xD;
Paul was going to the spring had he discovered him.&#xD;
After ages of watching and wicked thoughts, the messeii-&#xD;
ger returned with several other gentlemen, a physician,&#xD;
and a litter, and sadly they bore their senseless burdens&#xD;
hack to the capital, which they had left only a few hours&#xD;
before so recklessly.&#xD;

- HAVE always heard that the Southerners were&#xD;
such warm-hearted people," said a low, soft&#xD;
voice, with quite a foreign accent.&#xD;
"We are," was the quick reply; and a pair of beaming&#xD;
eyes looked defiantly into a pair of black eyes which were&#xD;
gazing fondly at her, while her attitude and air rather&#xD;
invited further defence of her country and people.&#xD;
"You must be an exception to the rule," then came&#xD;
deliberately.&#xD;
"I?" in unaffected surprise.&#xD;
"Yes, you; for you are only a beautiful iceberg-a&#xD;
snowflake, in dress and heart. And see, your hair is&#xD;
golden-that is not Southern! Surely, your ancestors&#xD;
must have drifted dowii from the North Pole-you must&#xD;

"Count D'Auvergne! '~ said the fair listener, springing&#xD;
to hei feet while all tlie hot, Southern blood in her veins&#xD;
rushed into her face. "1 am Southern to the core, and&#xD;
you shall find Southern blood quick and ready to avenge&#xD;
your words. Escort me to my uncle;" and sweeping out&#xD;
from behind the folds of curtains which draped a bow.&#xD;
window wli~re they sal~, she stood before him in all the&#xD;
rage and imperiousness of an insulted queen.&#xD;
"Pctrdonnd a thousand pardons, mademoiselle! I&#xD;

&#xD;
I am on fire while you are ice. I am a madman. Ii know&#xD;
not what II say. Kill me, but love me!" and in the hi.&#xD;
tensity of his passion he seized her hand, and would have&#xD;
draWn her back into the embrasure, but that she resisted&#xD;
the movement, saying:&#xD;
"I think a lady's private parlor would be a more ap-&#xD;
propriate place for love-making than a ball-room."&#xD;
"But we are not in' the ball-room. You are mistaken.&#xD;
See! we are alone, and I directed our steps here pur-&#xD;
posely."&#xD;
Looking around, Gertrude saw that the beautiful 861o~&#xD;
was deserted, for the guests had all gone into supper.&#xD;
"Purposely I '~ she said, turning her glorious eyes upon&#xD;
her suitor, with. an expression of displeasure.&#xD;
"Yes; because I felt that I must iell you to-night how&#xD;
much I love you. Bu1~ you turn away-you sigh-~--you&#xD;
are cold and indifferent."&#xD;
"Since we are alone, I will sit down for a moment,&#xD;
and tell you in a few words how much I regret this&#xD;
affair." And resuming her seat on the divan, she con~&#xD;
tinned with dignity blended with regret:&#xD;
"What you call indifference has been a desire on my&#xD;
part to save us both this issue."&#xD;
"If ~oii ~JreadeLd the issue, why did you encourage xn~&#xD;
"There is where you do me injustice. That I have en-&#xD;
joyed your society, I cannot deny; but I can also affirm&#xD;
that I n~vor dreamed of anything beyond a friendship."&#xD;
"A friendship!" said the Oomit in surprise. "Why,&#xD;
~you have received my attentions to the exclusion of&#xD;
almost every other admirer."&#xD;
"True; because you were the only one who gave me&#xD;
&#xD;
any' particular pleasure. You loved music, we read&#xD;
French together, you were congenial, and if I have been&#xD;
selfish, forgive ~&#xD;
"Selfish? you have been cruel;" and with a~moan he&#xD;
btu'ied his face in his hands, as if to hid&amp;amp; the terrible&#xD;
awakening.&#xD;
"But think, Count. You are a nobleman, while I am&#xD;
only an American girl."&#xD;
"That makes no difference, for I have distinctly&#xD;
avowed my purpose of marrying for love, not rank" was&#xD;
the manly and earnest reply.&#xD;
"But should I be acceptable to you, I might not be to&#xD;
your family."&#xD;
"Fortunately II do not belong to my family, nor am I&#xD;
responsible to any one but myself for what I do. If you&#xD;
love me, nothing but the strong arm of death can keep us&#xD;
apart. If-you-~--.do-----not----love-me," how slowly and&#xD;
tremblingly the words camel from his lips:' "tell me; do&#xD;
not be afraid, bat tell me, and let me go."&#xD;
Gertrude's head drooped lower upon the hand which&#xD;
supported it, and a deep sigh told more plahily than words&#xD;
how keenly she ~'ealized~'the painful duty of rejecting a&#xD;
love which oonl:d not be doubted. An unpleasant task&#xD;
always, for the few womei~i whG appreciate that the offer&#xD;
of the honest love of a sincf~re man is the highest corn-&#xD;
pii:ment that can be paid them. But minutes seemed like&#xD;
ages to the impatient lover, and when she did not reply,&#xD;
he said, ~in a trembling whisper:&#xD;
"You do not love me."&#xD;
A breathless suspense, and "No," fell like &amp;amp; death'&#xD;
knell upon the silence.&#xD;

"Nor never can?" he then said, as a dying man asks&#xD;
his physician if there is any hope.&#xD;
"Nor never can," was the final and fatal reply.&#xD;
"You love another~?" prompted jealousy.&#xD;
"Yes, that is-I did," came from her lips, as if by com-&#xD;
pulsion; and she hoped by this confession to be spared&#xD;
any more importunities.&#xD;
"JJid?" asked the Count in amazement. "And you'll&#xD;
marry him?"&#xD;
"Never! he's~ married!" said the trembling, agitated&#xD;
girl, as though she had been at a confessional, upon which&#xD;
her life depended.&#xD;
" Married? Then God help ris both!" and again he&#xD;
buried his face in his hands with a moan, while Gertrude&#xD;
sat, with a pained expression upon her face, looking&#xD;
through the blinds out into the pale, cold moonlight as it&#xD;
fell upon a foumitain in the fl9wer-garden. A few mo-&#xD;
ments of silence, and arising she said:&#xD;
"if you will be kind enough to assist me in finding my&#xD;
uncle, I will go home now."&#xD;
"I am always at your service, mademoiselle, but will&#xD;
you not have ~some refreshments?"&#xD;
"Nb, thank you! I feel as if II must be alone'&#xD;
"But your engagements?"&#xD;
"Must be broken!"&#xD;
"A glass of champagne will revive your spirits, and&#xD;
then you can keep them."&#xD;
"With ma~ny thanks for your kindness, I still must in-&#xD;
sist upon going home;" and as they walked through the&#xD;
elegant sd1on~s which were now thronged with the guests&#xD;
wb~o were returning from the banqueting hall, many&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
were the eyes which followed Gertrude in unuttered ad-&#xD;
miration.&#xD;
The occasion was a ball at the French Ambassador's;&#xD;
and out of all the glittering crowd, our Gertrude bore off&#xD;
the diadem that nighL&#xD;
And yet, how simply was she dressed: in white illusion&#xD;
with puffing and flounces, an overskirt looped with scar-&#xD;
let geraniums, a cluster of the same dazzling flowers in&#xD;
her blonde hair, and coral jewelry. Somehow, blue is&#xD;
the traditional color~ for blondes, and yet, if they did but&#xD;
know it, nothing is more becoming to them than scarlet&#xD;
and white. But then, a pretty woman can take great&#xD;
liberties; and so what does it matter so she's pretty at&#xD;
last? The uncle was found, adjeus were spoken, and the&#xD;
Count stood at the carriage-door saying "Good-night."&#xD;
"We shall see you soon," Gertrude was saying.&#xD;
"rtaineme~t, 8~ VOU&amp;amp; meperm~tte~ ceylaisir.',&#xD;
"We shall be only too happy to see you. Au revoir! '&#xD;
"Au revoir;" and as he stood in the moonlight looking&#xD;
after the carriage which held all that was dear to him in&#xD;
life, Gortrude leant her head upon her uncle's shoulder,&#xD;
and sobbed in a low, hysterical way which is not un-&#xD;
common to her sex.&#xD;

There had been no pleasure gilding Clifford's cup of&#xD;
pain, and he hadn't even th~t, one poor little consolation&#xD;
with which the generality of sinners try to balance their&#xD;
suffering.&#xD;
Nothing but remorse as the bitter wages of transgres-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
Was it nothing for him to lie there and helplessly sub-&#xD;
mit to the heaping of coals upon his head? Nothing for&#xD;
him to be watched over so tenderly, so lovingly, by4he&#xD;
woman he had wronged? Nothing for him to see her&#xD;
life-blood oozing out drop by drop, and day by day?&#xD;
Sometimes, in his agony, he would say to himself: "I&#xD;
will tell her all;" and as if driven to do it that instant,&#xD;
would say:&#xD;
"Virginia, come here; I wish to talk to you."&#xD;
Then, when sl~.e would come with a smile, and "Yes,&#xD;
dear," his heart would misgive him-lie would as soon&#xD;
kill a dove as wound her; and turning away, he wonid&#xD;
close his eyes, and say: "Never mind, now; some other&#xD;
time," little dreaming that she knew all. She, a woman&#xD;
and a wife, knew that her husband loved another&#xD;
woman, and yet could keep silent. "Impossible! She's&#xD;
only a pretty absurdity dressed up for a novel, for no&#xD;
*   such woman ever existed," sneer the wiseacres, who&#xD;
concur in the generally received opinion that the whole&#xD;
*    sex haven't an idea above a fashion-book or a new tonne&amp;amp;&#xD;
We'll admit, without further argument, that a woman&#xD;
*   with a soul is almost as rare as a man with the same&#xD;
faculty, and perhaps the reason she is so little appreciated&#xD;
is the slight demand in market for such creatures. If a&#xD;
man ever happens to have a ~soul, he can go into battle&#xD;
and get gloriously shot down for his country, or he can&#xD;

found hospitals for the poor, and build asylums for the&#xD;
homeless; but if a woman i~ born with a soul, society&#xD;
reserves the exclusive privilege of crushing out what God&#xD;
has given her, and of putting her in one of its model (?)&#xD;
grooves. If, however, she dares to go on in her own&#xD;
little way, the knowing ones conclude there must be&#xD;
something wrong about her; and from the moment she&#xD;
hoists a flag of opposition, from that moment begh~s a.&#xD;
'warfare between Mrs. Grundy and herself which only&#xD;
ceases in~ the grave. If Mrs. Clifford Troup, Jr., chose to&#xD;
lock her secret in her heart until she died, hadn't she a&#xD;
perfect right 'to di) it?&#xD;
If she chose to try and brighten her husband's life,&#xD;
which she well knew was as wretched as her own, who&#xD;
had any right to interfere'? What good would all the&#xD;
~'tears, all the Wringing of hands, all the hysterics, all the&#xD;
gossip with neighbors, have done?&#xD;
Would such ~ course have given 'her her husband's&#xD;
heart?&#xD;
Never! and having failed-to win his love, there was&#xD;
nothing more in life for her 'to do, except to smooth his&#xD;
pathway, and then to die. So long as health lasted, and'&#xD;
he was daily enabled to drown the upbraidings of con-&#xD;
science by artificial means, Clifford managed to worry&#xD;
along 'with life after a certain fashion. But when mis~~&#xD;
fortune and disease came upon him, and he was once&#xD;
more under the dominion of reason, new tortures con-&#xD;
stantly beset him, and life, in its beginning, was already&#xD;
Ao~e long remorse.&#xD;
His 'recovery seemed far removed as yet, for his iim&#xD;
'-provement was scarcely Perceptible, and no surprise will&#xD;
~be expressed at 'this, when to bodily suff.~wing were added&#xD;
&#xD;
his 'own secret griefs, and anxiety about the increasing&#xD;
troubles at -the "Manor." Besides all this, his practice&#xD;
was, of -course, entirely neglected, and the frequent drains&#xD;
made upon him by his father had left huin almost with-&#xD;
4ut a dollar. how 'humiliating to a man of his pride, and&#xD;
sometimese, in the bitterness of his heart, he would say:&#xD;
"Can any more be sent upon a man than this?"&#xD;
And all 'the time we are remembering that the "iniq~&#xD;
uities of the fathers shall be visited upon the children,"&#xD;
etc., etc.&#xD;
Then 'would come .a fresh stab i-n.the galling thought:&#xD;
"I deserve it all for turning from the path of honor and&#xD;
rectitude."&#xD;
His father had only been to see him once or 'twice, and&#xD;
then the visits were short band formal; but his poor&#xD;
mother, who came daily, 'how it crucified his 'heart to see&#xD;
her, for she was pale and thin, and weary and sad, while&#xD;
oftentimes her eyes 'were red 'witlr 'weeping, and he&#xD;
knew 'that the life she was forced to lead was killing&#xD;
her. Not 'a woM had they exchanged, but in the pressure&#xD;
of hands, in the kisses, in 'the glances, 'they knew all that&#xD;
each other suffered. It is said That the law of cornpensa~&#xD;
tion provides a corresponding pleasure for every woo;&#xD;
but -even this maynot he enjoyed, when -what would other-&#xD;
~~ise be a joy is but a fresh stab.&#xD;
Thus did the proffered kindness prove a pain, "when,&#xD;
on the morning in question, Virginia 'entered -the room&#xD;
with a waiter in her hand, and said': - -&#xD;
"Come, Clifford, do try and eat thi~ bird; for I cooked&#xD;
it with my own hands, .and 'I shall be .dr~adf ally disap~&#xD;
pointed if y~u do not gratify me."&#xD;
"Virginia, you ar~ too 'good, and for your sake I will&#xD;

try and eat something;" and the gratitude which filled&#xD;
the heart of the invalid welled up to his eyes and gave&#xD;
them a tenderer look than usual.&#xD;
"And see, Pve brought you the very prettiest camellias&#xD;
that were in the greenhouse;" and taking from tl~~&#xD;
waiter a cluster of these cold but lovely flowers, she held&#xD;
them up for his admiration.&#xD;
"how beautiful!" and taking the thin, little white&#xD;
hand 'that hold them, he kissed it, saying:&#xD;
"Thus do I thank you; and, darling, put them on the&#xD;
table here by me, for floWers do brighten a sick room so&#xD;
much."&#xD;
"Darling!" did he call her "darling"? Did she&#xD;
hear aright? Yes, he called her "darling," else why did&#xD;
her heart go pit-apat, why did the blood' mount to her&#xD;
pale cheeks, why did the tears stand in her eyes?&#xD;
She hadwaited, oh so long, for just one little word of&#xD;
love, just one little pet name, and this was the first; per-&#xD;
haps he did care for her, j list a little, after all. But in&#xD;
the new sensation which this "darling" created, she was&#xD;
forgetting all about Clifford's breakfast, and he was watch-&#xD;
ing her with a smile on his lips to see what effect this&#xD;
strange word would have.&#xD;
Suddenly she looked up, and her face was radiant as&#xD;
she said, with emphasis:&#xD;
"Yes, darling, I will arrange them as soon as you eat&#xD;
some Qf my little birdie;" and with these words she put&#xD;
a piece of the birdie's breast into his mouth, then gave&#xD;
him a sip 'of coffee;t'hen a piece of toast, and so on, until&#xD;
the breakfast was completed. Then she was more than&#xD;
repaid for burnt fingers 'and blistered cheeks, when her&#xD;
husband said:&#xD;
&#xD;
Why, I didn't know my little wife was such ~ good&#xD;
cook; the breakfast was delicious; but remember, Vir-&#xD;
ginia, you are not strong; and you must not fatigue your-&#xD;
self for me. At present, I have no appetite; but. when I&#xD;
get better, I will consider it a privilege to eat anything&#xD;
prepared at 'Mossy Creek."'&#xD;
"Isn't this better than that dreary old hotel at M-?"&#xD;
"Oh, a thousand times! Everything is so cosay and&#xD;
cheerful. I think I would have died had we remained&#xD;
there!"&#xD;
"But I hope you are going to improve rapidly here,&#xD;
Clifford."&#xD;
"I hope so, after the fatigue of the trip is over, for IL&#xD;
can ill afford to lose so much time from my business."&#xD;
"Oh, let your business go now, and don't worry your-&#xD;
self about what you can't help; it will only retard your&#xD;
recovery, if it does not make you ill;" and with these&#xD;
words, the little wee wife, who talked. such grand philoso-&#xD;
phy about not worrying over impossibilities, tucked the&#xD;
cover around her husband, stroked back his hair, kissed&#xD;
his brow, and taking the waiter, went downstairs ; while&#xD;
Clifford took her advice, turned over, forgot his troubles,&#xD;
closed his eye5, and went to sleep.&#xD;

HE blessed season of Lent had caused a lull in&#xD;
the gay world, and for one, Gertrude was glad&#xD;
of it, for she was heartily .~tired and worn out&#xD;
with her first season of city life.&#xD;
"What is the matter with you, Gertrude?" said her&#xD;
uncle one morning, from over his paper; of course, for lie&#xD;
had noticed' that forseveral days she had not been in her&#xD;
usual spirits.&#xD;
"Matter with me?" she answered, in rather ani ab-&#xD;
stracted and evasive manner.&#xD;
"Yes. What makes you look so blue these last few&#xD;
days?" again asked the anxious uncle.&#xD;
"Nothin~-.that. is, nothing much;" was the hesitating&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"I suppose you are sad because the balls ~an4 parties&#xD;
are all over, or because the' handsome Count dQesn't come&#xD;
so often no~v. Say, isii't that it?"&#xD;
"No, indeed, uncle, for I wouldn't care if I never at~&#xD;
tended another ball or party;" and leaving her seat, she&#xD;
walked around the table, for they were at breakfast and&#xD;
sat down beside him.&#xD;
"Why, Gertrude, you amaze me!"&#xD;
"I'm heartily sick and tired of the life I lead, and I&#xD;
want something to do."&#xD;
"Something to do? Why, haven't you your dressing,&#xD;
&#xD;

your balls, your parties, operas, theatres, dinners, beaux,&#xD;
flirtations, music, and French? Heaven knows, I should&#xD;
think they would give you something to do! Any one of&#xD;
them would be enough to keepaman busy!"&#xD;
"And is that all a woman is born for? "&#xD;
"It seems so, or at least custom has so decreed it!"&#xD;
"And am I to be a slave to the decrees of custom all&#xD;
my life, whether I wish to be or not?"&#xD;
The uncle, who was rather orthodoxx in his views about.&#xD;
women, was quite amazed at the revolt of his niece, and&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"The end of all this is ~iot so 1~ad."&#xD;
"Whatistheend?"&#xD;
"Marriage."&#xD;
"You mean to say that women are expected to appear&#xD;
as puppets, as walking dolls dressed up for exhibition for&#xD;
such a length of time, and then are to be knocked off to&#xD;
the highest bidder?"&#xD;
"She has her choice between that and being an old&#xD;
maid."&#xD;
"if I were a man, I wouldn't marry one of these doib&#xD;
babies; and besides, where is the disg~raee of being an old&#xD;
maid?"&#xD;
"I never could see any, but then the world looks at. i~&#xD;
differently."&#xD;
"And must the world force a woman into marriage,.&#xD;
because the world thinks it a disgrace to bean old maid? "'&#xD;
"There are other reasons, though, and better ones,. why&#xD;
women should marry."&#xD;
"What are they?"&#xD;
"In the first place, it is right, and was so intended by&#xD;
God."&#xD;

"But you evidently agree with St. Paul that 'it is bet-&#xD;
ter for man to be alone,"' with a smile.&#xD;
"Oh, I'm not in the question," he answered, looking a&#xD;
little teased.&#xD;
"Well then, it's right for a woman to marry. That's&#xD;
reason No. 1; what are the others?"&#xD;
"They are happier!"&#xD;
"Whether they love their husbands or not, I ~ ~~ppose?&#xD;
Reason No.2. Any others?"&#xD;
"Who'll take care of them when they are old?"&#xD;
- "Oh, that's it, is it? We are to marry for board and&#xD;
clothes. If you taught us how to do something else be-&#xD;
sides dress and flirt, we would be able to. take care of our*&#xD;
selves."&#xD;
"I have no objection to your doing something!"&#xD;
"But I don't know how!&#xD;
"II~re.J am without a dollar in the ~vorld, only as mother&#xD;

he found his niece so heterodox in her ideas.&#xD;
They were both silent for a little while; then Gertrude&#xD;
said:&#xD;

to say, with a mischievous smile.&#xD;
"It's true, nevertheless; and a woman who wants to do&#xD;
something, who wants to earn her own living by the&#xD;
* brains, and with the hands God has given her."&#xD;
"My dear child, you fill me with admiration ;" and&#xD;
drawing l~er towards him, he kissed her brow, while a&#xD;
* slight moisture might have been noticed in his eyes.&#xD;
"But what can you do?"&#xD;
"At present, nothing! but in the future, whatever we&#xD;
choose to-day!"&#xD;
"Would to heaven you were a boy!" was the enthusi~&#xD;
astic reply of the statesman, while his eyes glowed with&#xD;
thoughts of a brilliant future, if only her sex were different.&#xD;
"Make me a boy," she answered, while her cheeks&#xD;
burned and her eyes sparkled with the new life which&#xD;
was even then opening before her, in imagination.'&#xD;
"Teach me some profession, some employment, some-&#xD;
thing, and you will lift me from a refining, miserable&#xD;
idler, into a noble and a true woman. Only give rue&#xD;
something to do, and I'll do it!"&#xD;
"Without any regrets?"&#xD;
"Without any regrets," was the eager repetition.&#xD;
"But you can't make speeches, you can't be a lawyer,&#xD;
you can't go into politics."&#xD;
"But I could be your amanuensis as well or better&#xD;
than the one you employ, and with some instruction I&#xD;
could keep your books, etc.; while, in the' mean time, with&#xD;
your permission, I might be perfecting myself in French&#xD;
and music, with a view to teaching.~~&#xD;
Noble girl! It shall be as you say, only I prefer&#xD;
that you shall learn to make yourself useful to me; for I&#xD;

&#xD;
flever wish you to leave me, unless it be to marry the&#xD;
man of your choice." With these words, he gave her a&#xD;
searching look, to discover, if possible, whether the past&#xD;
was buried or only slumbering; and. somehow he fancied.&#xD;
there was a tone of resignation and sadness' in her voice&#xD;
when she said:&#xD;
"Then I will be with you until IL die; for, I do not&#xD;
think I shall ever marry.?'&#xD;
"Come, make no rash promises, but tell me when you&#xD;
will be ready to enter upon your duties?"&#xD;
"To-day."&#xD;
"Your answer bespeaks promptness, and that is one of&#xD;
the chief requisites in all kinds of business. Then, if&#xD;
you will be ready to-day, I must dismiss the present im.&#xD;
cumbent."&#xD;
"That would be hardly fair. Give him notice; thea'&#xD;
~ allow him time to get another situation."&#xD;
"Your' consideration for others is a just reL.uke for&#xD;
my inconsiderate haste, and I will act upon the kind sug-&#xD;
gestion. By George! you ought to have been a man;&#xD;
you would have made your mark!"&#xD;
"I hope to make it as a woman, or II shall not consider&#xD;
'myself worthy to' have your blood flowing in my veins."&#xD;
"Oh, you flatterer! But, of course, you must retain&#xD;
a few female attributes."&#xD;
"Most certainly! if~ they consist in saying, not only&#xD;
good and true, but pleasant things~"&#xD;
"Well, I must go now to meet an appointment; and&#xD;
believe me, child, I walk forth with a prouder heart than&#xD;
ever beat before in my breast. I had some fears about~&#xD;
introducing you into society here, lest you should be-&#xD;
come, as most womeii do, fascinated only with its frivoli.&#xD;
&#xD;
ties. But YOU have come out of the contest with such&#xD;
honor to yourself an4 glory to me, that I shall have no&#xD;
apprehensions for the ~Euture. I have now one request to&#xD;
make, and that is, tha~t you shalt confide ~ll your thoughts,&#xD;
hopes, and wishes to me. Will you do it?"&#xD;
"Most cheerfully, and feel honored in granting a&#xD;
request which reflects so much distinction upon me."&#xD;
"Honors will be easy, I think," he answered - merrily,&#xD;
while Gertrude brought his hat, cane, and cloak, for the&#xD;
weather was yet cold ~ta~d bleak.&#xD;
Receiving then the parting kiss, and holding the door&#xD;
open for him to pass out, she returned to her household&#xD;
duties, merry as a lark, and thinking joyfully of the&#xD;
happy time when she, too, should have something to do&#xD;
-some engagement t4~ keep, some business to perform.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIJI.&#xD;
&#xD;
DEAR PAUL!&#xD;
OOR Paul," say we, for we had almost forgotten&#xD;
he was in the land of the living.&#xD;
It was evident, however, some one else remem-&#xD;
bered him, and that fact doubtless will repay him for any&#xD;
oblivion on our part. Come now, let us transpose the&#xD;
golden rule, for the first (?) time, you know, by doing unto&#xD;
him not as we would have him do unto us, and having&#xD;
quieted our 'consciences, peep over his shoulder and see&#xD;
what he is reading. lie w~s keeping house at "The Re-&#xD;
treat," and with the morning mail came a letter wl~ich&#xD;
sent his heart up into his mouth, and his blood tingling~&#xD;
through his veins, while his hand trembled so that he&#xD;
could scarcely break the seal. It was a clear, bold hand,&#xD;
bespeaking strength and character, and read, thus:&#xD;
WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., February l9tA, 18-.&#xD;
DEAR PAUL :-I am the happiest of women, and write you a&#xD;
hasty note to tell you of my good fortune. I will not call it a reply&#xD;
to your last charming letter, but beg that you will take the will for&#xD;
the deed this time. I have quit being a fashionable young lady,&#xD;
and have gone to work in real earnest.&#xD;
Uncle has dismissed his amanuensis, whom he found. very incom-&#xD;
petent after he had gone, and having installed me in that position,&#xD;
I am now up to my eyes in righting matters. I am also studying&#xD;
bookkeeping, with a view to taking charge of uncle's business.&#xD;
Dear Uncle says, "if I were only a boy, I would make my mark;"&#xD;
and I assure him I intend to make it, even if.[ am a woman. lie is&#xD;
&#xD;
DEAR PAIJL!&#xD;
&#xD;
253&#xD;
&#xD;
~much delighted and amazed that I prefer business to society, and&#xD;
kindly gives me all the assistance he can. . We are looking forward&#xD;
to your visit with a great deal of pleasure, especially Uncle (?) You&#xD;
will be here by the inauguration. Uncle desires to he remembered,&#xD;
and says take care of the dear old "Retreat," and don't neglect&#xD;
his dogs and horses. But I must say "good-by," for "business of&#xD;
a pressing nature demands my time," as you men say; and how&#xD;
nicely it sounds, for I think it is glorious to have something to do.&#xD;
"Good-by."                     Your friend, GERTRUDE.&#xD;
P. S. Eliza, Jane, and' Harry are well, and take to city life very&#xD;
naturally I&#xD;
Signed Gertrude! That looks suspicious, and bodes well&#xD;
for "Dear Paul;" for whenever a woman signs only one&#xD;
name, sh&amp;amp; must be on most excellent (?~ terms with him to&#xD;
whom she writes. And how very feminine the "P. S.,,&#xD;
-for as some one has said, women generally put the gist&#xD;
of what they have to say into their postscripts. It was&#xD;
only a plain, frank, girlish letter, a deal of like but no&#xD;
love in it; and yet it made iPaul supremely happy, par-&#xD;
ticulai'ly when he 4welt upon the words," we are looking&#xD;
forward to your visit with a great deal of pleasure."&#xD;
Then he would read it over again; and indeed, what is&#xD;
there in life that gives us more real, genuine, and unadul-&#xD;
terated pleasure than letters from those we love?&#xD;
It seems a very little thing to take an envelope, to&#xD;
break the seal, and then to find an ecstasy of joy filling&#xD;
our souls as we read those pages which~ are covered with&#xD;
words that breathe and burn. And perchance we may&#xD;
find a presence there which shall compensate us for the&#xD;
weary miles which separate us from the loved and absent.&#xD;
We always said "amen" to Sancho Panza's exclama-&#xD;
tion about the man who invented sleep, and to that peti.&#xD;

&#xD;
tion for blessing we desire to add: "God bless the man&#xD;
who invented IettersY&#xD;
Sometimes, we think, brief as it is, that the pleasure of&#xD;
receiving and reading letters is even greater than that of&#xD;
presence, for somehow we put more of ourselves into our&#xD;
letters than we do in our conversation. The reason for&#xD;
this is obvious. In society, we endeavor to conceal our&#xD;
real feelings; but in writing, there's no one looking at us,&#xD;
no one listening to us, and our poor downtrodden hearts&#xD;
will have a little showing in spite of us. But time is&#xD;
hurrying us on, and so we leave "dear Paul," with his&#xD;
letter and his thoughts.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIX~&#xD;
NOTHING I&#xD;
HE Ides of March found Clifford back at his post&#xD;
in the village of L-;: and the warm welcome*&#xD;
he received, both from his uncle's family and his&#xD;
friends, would have gratified the reasonable vanity of&#xD;
any man. He was still weak, for hi~ arm was far&#xD;
from being well, and it. was against the; earnest pro-&#xD;
testations of his wife, physician, and family, that he&#xD;
returned to business in his present debilitated staW.&#xD;
Virginia was not strong enough to accompany him; and&#xD;
in truth she had grown so much weaker that she scarcely&#xD;
now ever left her bed. The poor father and mother&#xD;
were heart4roken over their one little iamb; but to their&#xD;
oft-repeated and anxious inquiries as to what was the&#xD;
matter, the patient sufferer always answered, "Nothing."&#xD;
Day by. day she grew weaker, paler, and thinner, and&#xD;
good old Dr. Bell was baffled for once.&#xD;
* His prescriptions evidently did not reach the nialady;&#xD;
and it was well for our little martyr's. secret that he did&#xD;
not possess the usual insight of his profession, or he might&#xD;
have seen that there was something within which no&#xD;
human skill could cure.&#xD;
"Have you been taking the tonic Jeannie?" asked'&#xD;
this good old doctor,. one morning; for the anxious pa-&#xD;
rents would have lift come. to see her every day.&#xD;
"No, doctor,?' answered a thin pair ot bluish lipej f*&#xD;
&#xD;

250             OT1ING!I&#xD;
&#xD;
257&#xD;
&#xD;
the ~blood had all gou~ out of her face, and she Wfl8&#xD;
ghastly until it was distressing to look at her.&#xD;
"Why ?" he asked, feeling her pulse, and seeing how&#xD;
very much weaker she was.&#xD;
"Because, doctor, I fancied it didn't do me any good,"&#xD;
with a sweet smile; for, although wretched herself, t~he&#xD;
had determined, with her usual unselfishness, to make&#xD;
those around her happy, so long as life was spared.&#xD;
"But you are not the physician, Mis&amp;amp;-or Madam-I&#xD;
beg Mrs. Clifford Troup's pardon, but you will never be&#xD;
anything but just little Jeannie Dearing to me."&#xD;
"Nor to me, nuther, doctor," chimed in old black&#xD;
:Mammy, who scarcely left her "dear chile'&amp;amp;' bed day&#xD;
or night; "and do Lord knows I wish dis 'ore chile neber&#xD;
had gone off and lef' us. I jes believe if she neber had,&#xD;
she'd neber bin in dis fix."&#xD;
"Oh, Mammy, you mustn't talk that way! Hush, now!&#xD;
and don't ever talk that way again."&#xD;
The doctor smiled at iMlainmy's notions, and then, turn-&#xD;
ing to his patient, said:&#xD;
"But you must take the tonic, Jeannie; for I find you&#xD;
ver~ much weaker this morning."&#xD;
"Well, doctor, if you say so, I will;"&#xD;
"That's a good girl! and give her some of it now, Main-&#xD;
my, right away. Take it for a week, regularly, and you&#xD;
will be so much better that we will have a picnic down&#xD;
on 'Mossy Creek,' at .the very spot where you and I used&#xD;
to go fishing when you were a wee little thing. Do you&#xD;
remember?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes," with a sigh. "It was ever so long ago."&#xD;
"Yes; how old we are getting!" he smiled, and said.&#xD;
" In addition to *the. tonic, Mammy, you must try and get&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
NOTHlING !&#xD;
&#xD;
her up every day, so that. she can walk around the house;&#xD;
and if you would take her out on the lawn in the warm&#xD;
spring sunshine, it would do her good."&#xD;
"Yes, sah," answered Mammy, as though she under.&#xD;
stood it all, and a little m9re too.&#xD;
"But remember, now, Jeannie, I tell yon once more to&#xD;
take the tonic regularly, for we are to have the picnic in&#xD;
a week. Will see you to-morrow. Good-by;" and shak-&#xD;
ing her little thin, white hand, he was gone.&#xD;
Outside the door, the anxious mother stood weeping;&#xD;
and as the doctor came out she said:&#xD;
"Doctor, do tell me, what is the matter with my&#xD;
precious child?"&#xD;
"I think she is only suffering now from the fatigue&#xD;
consequent upon nursing Clifford. She was not able to&#xD;
do it, but you know she would do it, and now we have&#xD;
this unpleasant consequence. The excitement and anx-.&#xD;
iety which then sustained her being gone, excessive de-&#xD;
bility ensues; but I do not think there is any cause for&#xD;
appreliensi6n."&#xD;
b~ Really, doctor?" was the anxious question.&#xD;
"Really, madam, that is my candid opinion. But do&#xD;
not let her see you crying, or I will not answer for the&#xD;
consequences;" and bowing "good-morning," he took&#xD;
his departure.&#xD;
"Will not answer for the consequences!" Only see&#xD;
how little he knew of the inward strength of that frail&#xD;
body. Indeed, like many others, he did not believe it&#xD;
possible for a woman to be wretched, and not make a&#xD;
fuss about it. It had never occurred to him that such a&#xD;
fragile little creature could suffer and be silent, or that&#xD;
she could lock a seci~et in her heart, (and take it down to&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="258-259" xml:id="VAC8257-00000129"/>&#xD;
the grave with her. But we see and know that she can&#xD;
do it-that she does do it-and that, evefl while her heart&#xD;
is bleeding at every pore, she smiles, forgetting herself&#xD;
in the pleasure that she desires to give others; taking all&#xD;
the burden upon her own little shoulders, which others&#xD;
would have borne so gladly for her sake.&#xD;
And what would the world think if we should say that&#xD;
there are many other w~men who put their anguish out&#xD;
*of sight, and while their life-blood is dripping drop by&#xD;
drop, those who ar&amp;amp; iea~rest and dearest believe them&#xD;
well and happy.&#xD;
And so that little child-wife upstairs, with her head&#xD;
resting in her old black Mammy's lap, was dying; and&#xD;
the mother went singing through the house because the&#xD;
doctor thought there was nothing serious, the matter;&#xD;
and the father was so encouraged that he had gone to the&#xD;
city to look after some business.&#xD;
Could loneliness be more lonely? In the bosom of&#xD;
one's family, yet alone.&#xD;
Dying! but they did not see it, for she called it&#xD;
"Kothing!"&#xD;

crime, seems to possess a peenilar fas-&#xD;
cination which leads its victims down to deeper&#xD;
depths, until the' final hour of ruin comes.&#xD;
Once in debt, how hard to break its iron fetters! Once&#xD;
in crime, how hard to wash out its bloody spots!&#xD;
What need to partkmlarize ? The storm that li~d so&#xD;
long been brewing over the "Manor '~ burst at last, and&#xD;
nothing was spared to appease its fury.&#xD;
We already know how hopelessly involved the Hon.&#xD;
Mr. Troup was, and we also know his son has told him&#xD;
that he would never again be a beggar, not even to save&#xD;
the "Manor."&#xD;
lie had, rescued it once, and how dearly that redemp-&#xD;
tioii cost, we know only too well.&#xD;
had the father properly appreciated this sacrifice, and&#xD;
realized the fact that he was no longer a millionnaire,&#xD;
matters might have taken a different turn. As it was, he&#xD;
squandered in 'reckless waste all the money he could lay&#xD;
his hands npon, and for the last few months had been&#xD;
living by disposing of the remainder of the family silver.&#xD;
The "Manor" was under another heavy mortgage, and a&#xD;
week preceding the day of which we write Mr. Troup&#xD;
had been notified that unless the money was forthetming&#xD;
under the bond, the property would be seized at the time&#xD;
specified in the deetl. This was a terrible awakening&#xD;

&#xD;
from fancied security, for heretofore some friendly han ~&#xD;
had always been stretched forth to relieve him at the&#xD;
last moment; and besides, he flattered himself that no man&#xD;
would dai'e to treat the Hon. Mr. Troup as if he were&#xD;
a common mortal. Unpalatable though the fact may be,&#xD;
there are a few men in the world who love mpney more&#xD;
than blood, and it is a well-known fact that these same&#xD;
vulgar Q) creatures take special delight in tearing down an&#xD;
aristocracy to which, unfortunately, they do not belong.&#xD;
Mr. Hammerly being of this persuasion, chuckled over the&#xD;
mortgage which he obtained for a contemptible sum, and&#xD;
prayed in his bad heart that Mr. Troup would fail, to&#xD;
come to time, so'that lie might enjoy the exquisite felicity&#xD;
of driving this haughty aristocrat from his ancestral do-&#xD;
main. It seems that Mr. Troup knew his man, for, as&#xD;
often as the "Manor" had been jeopardized, he now, for&#xD;
the first time, contemplated leaving it.&#xD;
So great~ was his pride, though, that he could not g~dn&#xD;
his consent toJLcquaint even his wife with his plans, arid&#xD;
it was now 'the last night at the "Manor."&#xD;
If it were possible, we should like to pass it over in&#xD;
silence; or throw such an impenetrable veil over the scene&#xD;
that no human eye could see behind its folds.&#xD;
But we dare not, for b? this man's life we hope to show&#xD;
not only the crime, but the inevitable ruin, which must&#xD;
finally come to those who niake money their God.&#xD;
Did not the Lord God say:&#xD;
"Thou shalt have none other gods but me!',&#xD;
But how fex~eed the Divine command in comparison&#xD;
with the         ho defy it!&#xD;
The picture was enough to have moved a stone to pity;&#xD;
but It seems to be one of the inevitable laws of transgrea~.&#xD;
&#xD;
sion, to deny us that sympathy and consolation which&#xD;
might be ours under different, circumstances. Bo~~ed&#xD;
beneath the weight of unhappy memories which fio9ded&#xD;
his soul, crushed with the thought of his impending doom,&#xD;
shut out by his pride from the sympathy of a single hu-&#xD;
man being, and too obstinate to ask help of God, the old&#xD;
man sat alone with his gray head bowed upon a table.&#xD;
The night was far spent, ai~d yet no feeling of sleep came&#xD;
over him; for remorse was.too busy, conscience too parn~&#xD;
ful, and he now felt all the agony of leaving the home.&#xD;
stead of his fathers. He now remembered that he had so&#xD;
often I)een'unjust where he might have been just; imperi-&#xD;
ous, where he might have spoken a kind i~rord; tyrannical,&#xD;
where he might have exercised mercy; extravagant, when&#xD;
by economy he might have liquidated his debts, and still&#xD;
been an honorable man and the happy owner of the&#xD;
"Manor." To some extent, his imperiousness may be&#xD;
accounted for upon the score of the slavery system then&#xD;
existing, for the keeping of human souls would make&#xD;
the greatest humanitarian who ever lived domineering.&#xD;
We do not sajit would make men cruel, but overbear-&#xD;
ing; and bitter as the thought may be, it will have to be&#xD;
swallowed along with some other unpleasant truths.&#xD;
The Hon. Mr. rl7roup was a humane master, but arrogant;&#xD;
a kind husband, but exacting; a model (~) father, who&#xD;
made noble&amp;amp;9e obliae strangle the cries ~f Nature, and set&#xD;
at defiance the 1aw~ of God. But retribution came at&#xD;
last, and upon this night of self..examination all the acts&#xD;
of his life combined did not give him so much pain as&#xD;
that one in which lie had sacrificed his boy for money.&#xD;
What goodhad it doire?&#xD;
Better ask what evil it had not done? For while it.&#xD;

had only postpoiied the hour of ruin, it had wrecked the&#xD;
lives of two innocent beh~gs, and ,~even now the ghosts&#xD;
of ~on and daughter were demanding retribution at the&#xD;
hands of him who immolated them.&#xD;
The night was almost gone, and a faint streak of dawn&#xD;
was visible in the east, when Mrs. Troup, weary and pale,&#xD;
left her sleepless and unhappy bed to seek her husband,&#xD;
for whose coming she had waited in vain. Going to the&#xD;
library where she felt he must be, she turned the bolt&#xD;
softly, and entered.&#xD;
"Who's there?" cried the old man springing up, and&#xD;
full of that nervous apprehension whk~h is the result of&#xD;
a conscience ill ~t ease.&#xD;
"it's only I, Clifford," answered his wife.&#xD;
"Why could you not leave me alone?" he asked&#xD;
bitterly, and sinking back jnto the chair from which he&#xD;
had arisen.&#xD;
"I3ecause, Clifford, 1 believe a wife's place to be by&#xD;
her husband's side when he is in trouble;" and taking a&#xD;
seat by him, she kissed his bowed head, then leaned upon&#xD;
his shoulder.&#xD;
"Who said Ii was in trouble?" he asked, raising his&#xD;
head and trying to~ look courageous in the midst of~&#xD;
despair.&#xD;
"Oh, Clifford! A wife does not need 'words to tell&#xD;
her when her husband is suffering. Why do you con-&#xD;
ceal anything from me? Why do you not kt me help&#xD;
you bear your burden? No matter what it is' tell me,&#xD;
Clifford, or I shall feel that you consider me unwo4hy to&#xD;
bear the sacred name of ~jf~*~~&#xD;
Then, without any preliminaries to prepare her for the&#xD;
blow, he said ~quickly, as if in a hurry to get through&#xD;
&#xD;
AT LAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
263&#xD;
&#xD;
with a painful task: "Since you will know it, I am&#xD;
ruined, and today we leave the 'Manor' forever!"&#xD;
There were no screams-no exclamations-only a sur-&#xD;
prised start-a clenching of the hands-a scarcely audible&#xD;
moan-a white cirde around her lips, which were coin-&#xD;
pressed tightly to keep from uttering a syllable, lest&#xD;
some word should escape which would brin~ additional&#xD;
b&#xD;
pain to him whom it was now her duty and desire to&#xD;
console.&#xD;
In the morbid condition of his mind, it was but natural&#xD;
for him to misconstrue her silence, and he said:&#xD;
"Mary, if you have any reproaches, keep them to your-&#xD;
self~ I am in n'o mood to hear them; aiid besides, I would&#xD;
have spared you what you ]iave forced from me."&#xD;
"Reproaches, Clifford? For what do you take me&#xD;
Am I not your wife, do I not love you?" and patting&#xD;
both arms around his neck, she kissed his sorrow-seamed&#xD;
brow.&#xD;
Overcome by this unexpected manifestation of his&#xD;
wife's unchanging love, he folded her in his arms, and&#xD;
bowing his head, upon her shoulder, wept the first tears&#xD;
which had moistened his eyes for years. A1as! could&#xD;
the revolution that was going on in 'his breast then have&#xD;
taken place sooner, we had been spared the sad task&#xD;
before us. The first torrent of grief over, he looked imp,&#xD;
and through his tears said:&#xD;
"You love me, Mary? I, who have brought di~gm~ace,&#xD;
and dishonor, and misery upon youP'&#xD;
"You have brought nothing upon me which I am not&#xD;
willing to bear for your sake," she answered, like the true&#xD;
wife she was, while one arm rested lovingly around his&#xD;

"I go hence a Aishonored maul"&#xD;
"Why dishonored i?"&#xD;
"Because n~y name is a synonym for all that is faith.&#xD;
less."&#xD;
"So much more the reason that your wife should cling&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
"And you are ready to begin life over again with a&#xD;
pauper, Mary?"&#xD;
"Ready to share any fate witbmy husband!"&#xD;
"God in Heaven, this is more than I deserve; but if&#xD;
you will cling to and sustain me, I shall yet liMe to&#xD;
retrieve the past."&#xD;
"Dear husband, if you will only confide in me as you&#xD;
used to do-if you ~vill only let me~help you, you do not&#xD;
kn9w how it will gladden my heart to cheer you, no mat~&#xD;
ter how the clouds n~ay thicken."&#xD;
"Then you shall help me, Mary; for ever since I have&#xD;
withheld my troubles from you, things have been getting&#xD;
worse and worse. Now, I will tell you my plans, which&#xD;
up to this ti5e~ a false pride has made me cQnoeal from&#xD;
you. I intend giving up 'everything here to tiny credit~&#xD;
ors."&#xD;
"That is right."&#xD;
"And then opening a law-office in M-, from which&#xD;
* I can reap a comfortable if not a handsome support."&#xD;
"Of course.~~&#xD;
"We will take 'a house as soon as we have time to look&#xD;

around, and in the meantime will remain with the girls.'&#xD;
What do you think ~f my plans?"&#xD;
With a heart aching at the prospect of leaving the&#xD;
"Manor," ~he answered like the brave woman she was:&#xD;
"I think well of them, and I do not doubt but that we&#xD;
will be more contented there than here, harassed as we&#xD;
constantly are by our creditors; for when we give up&#xD;
everything they will know we have nothing more; and&#xD;
perhaps will let us rest."&#xD;
"True, my brave wife, my good angel! But see, it&#xD;
is day, and as there is much' to be done, we have no&#xD;
time to lose;, and may God bless you for lifting the&#xD;
burden from my heart, as you *have done this morn-&#xD;
ing. Have the house put in perfect order, for doubt-&#xD;
less ilammerly will be here early to claim his ill-gotten&#xD;
prize;" and with a kiss, the husband and wife who,&#xD;
through the false pride of the former, had been so long&#xD;
estranged, repaired to their respective duties with lighter&#xD;
hearts than they had known for many weary months.&#xD;
Thus we see that perfect confidence and love between&#xD;
man and wife can brighten even the brink of despair, and&#xD;
as God is our Judge, we believe nothing less should exist.&#xD;
How true it is that we never know how much we can&#xD;
endure until our powers of endurance are called into&#xD;
action.&#xD;
Mrs. Troup was an example, for had she given way to&#xD;
her feelings, the day would have been spent in useless&#xD;
weeping; but with a stout heart she forced back 'her&#xD;
tears, and 'went bravely forward to do whatever had to be&#xD;
done. Calling the servants early, she gave each their re~&#xD;
spective tasks, and with kind words flitted here and tliere,&#xD;
encouraging them in their work. To avoid these painful&#xD;

266                  AT LAST.&#xD;
in-door preparations, Mr. Troup sought relief outside; but&#xD;
there was no peace for him, not even in the woods, for&#xD;
there memory followed him, and the accusations of a&#xD;
guilty conscience tortured him almost to madness. Grief&#xD;
made him oblivious of time, and when, at length, he con-&#xD;
sulted his watch, he was amazed to find that several hours&#xD;
had gone by. Quickly retracing his steps, he stood for 8&#xD;
moment upon an eminence that commanded a flue view&#xD;
of his lost estate, and taking a last lingering look, went&#xD;
hurriedly on to the liouse, without even a backward&#xD;
glance.&#xD;
The house was not one of those palaces that you gen-&#xD;
erally read of in novels, but was a regular Southern&#xD;
home; and when we say this, we mean it was one of&#xD;
those large, square frame houses, with Corinthian pillars&#xD;
supporting a colonnade which ran around three sides and&#xD;
connected with ~vings at either end; large windows t~tlic&#xD;
floor, and a broad flight of granite steps, which were&#xD;
guarded by couchant lions; a broad hall, with grand&#xD;
apartments opening on to it, and everything suggestive of&#xD;
immense comfort and immense wealth.&#xD;
There are scores of such houses in the South, and the&#xD;
picture will be recognized at once.&#xD;
Mr. Troup returned none too soon; for he had been&#xD;
preceded by Hammerly, his lawyer, and the sheriff, and&#xD;
the three were sitting in sullen silence upon the gallery,&#xD;
awaiting the coming of the "haughty aristocrat." The&#xD;
truth is, ilammerly feared the 'bird had flown; for a&#xD;
villain believes all others villains, the same ~s a drunkard&#xD;
thinks all othei~ men drunk. As for ilammerly, his&#xD;
regard for man's moral (?) status surpassed even Wal-&#xD;
role's; for the premier limited his men who could be&#xD;
&#xD;
AT LAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
bought to that much-abused class known as politicians;&#xD;
but, judging others by himself, friend Ilammerly boldly&#xD;
declared That "every mai~ has his price."&#xD;
That naughty poet, Byron, said: "Revenge is sweet&#xD;
to womefl;" and looking into' ilammerly's heart, we find&#xD;
that it is also sweet to men sometimes; for lie would&#xD;
have considered the estate of the Troups a poor recom-&#xD;
pense for his money, had he been denied the exquisite&#xD;
pleasure of insulting the "haughty aristocratt" and this&#xD;
was because Mi.. Tyoup did not receive him socially, but&#xD;
treated him like the cur he was.&#xD;
While, h~ was nursing his wrath,~and fearing he would&#xD;
not have the long-coveted revenge, the honorable subject&#xD;
of his thoughts walked slowly down the avenue, and,&#xD;
ascending the steps, greeted his enemies with the same&#xD;
ease and elegance with which' he would have received a&#xD;
foreign embassy. his 'r~ianner was cold and haughty,&#xD;
though, and plainly said, "Thus far shalt thou go, and no&#xD;
farther."&#xD;
"Good-morning, gentlemen. II am sorry if II have kept&#xD;
'you waiting. Come in!" and as he led the way, Ham-&#xD;
merly followed with a sardonic grin on his bad, bold&#xD;
face, saying:&#xD;
"We thought you had gone for good, and-"&#xD;
"Mr. hlaininerly!" said Mr. Troup, turning and look-&#xD;
ing at him with such a look as made him tremble frQm&#xD;
head to foot, while the pettifogger at his back pulled his&#xD;
coat, and whispered: 'KE~o be more particular."&#xD;
With a dogged determination, hiowev~r, to humiliate&#xD;
his aristocratic debtor all thar he possibly could, and ig..&#xD;
noring entirely his lawyer's whispered advice, lie said:&#xD;
"Come now, Mr. Troup, as our time is d-n precious,&#xD;

we've got none to throw away on airs. If you've got the&#xD;
spondulix, out with it; and if you haven't got it, we'll&#xD;
proceed at once to take an inventory of the house, furni-~&#xD;
ture, plantation, etc."&#xD;
Mr. Troup did not answer at once, for pever before&#xD;
had man dared to speak to him thus, and the effort to&#xD;
control himself was taxing all the mettle in his power.&#xD;
Becoming impatient, Ilammerly said again:&#xD;
'~ Have y6u got the money?"&#xD;
"I regret~to say I have not, but__"&#xD;
"I knew it, I knew it," chuckkd this low adventurer.&#xD;
"Never knew one of these d-n fine gentlemen come&#xD;
up to time in my life. They are always ready, though,&#xD;
with the most polished regrets, and the most eloquent&#xD;
apologies; but these won't satisfy me, so you had as well&#xD;
spare your breath., You see I expected trouble, so I just&#xD;
brought along the county guardian to put down any little&#xD;
unpleasantness which might come up."&#xD;
Wirthing under the impertinence of this low-bred fel-&#xD;
low, Mr. Troup felt as if he could grind him to atoms, as&#xD;
he would a worm under his foot; but remembering how&#xD;
entirely he was in his power, he said sternly, and with-&#xD;
out condescending to notice his insinuations:&#xD;
"Mr. Hainmerly, we are hQre for 1~usiness, not conver-&#xD;
sation."&#xD;
As it is a xvell-established fact that only the generous&#xD;
can be magnanimous to the fallen, we should not be dis-&#xD;
appointed to find the ignoble Ilammerly a stranger to&#xD;
such a noble sentiment.&#xD;
At length the knave was awed into silence by that mag-&#xD;
netic power which superior minds must ever exert over&#xD;
&#xD;
inferior intellects, and Mr. Troup continued to say, with&#xD;
a dignity and iciness whk~h was unapproachable:&#xD;
"The bond distinctly says if the money is not returned&#xD;
on such a day, that I relinquish all interest in the prop-&#xD;
erty now held by me, and known as the 'Troup Manor;'&#xD;
does it not?"&#xD;
It does," was the laconic reply, while the speaker was&#xD;
burning with inward rage.&#xD;
"Then, as Ii haven't the money, we will proceed to take&#xD;
an inventory of the property, etc;" and leading the way,&#xD;
the three men arose to follow him.&#xD;
Turning around, Mr. Troup said, with the arrogance of&#xD;
a master addressing a serf:&#xD;
"Your lawyer will accompany us, Mr. Hammerly, and&#xD;
the sheriff can either await you here or on the gallery."&#xD;
Ilammerly looked the daggers he dared not utter, and&#xD;
both he and his friends were in their hearts as much&#xD;
frightened as if they had been in the presence of the arch-&#xD;
fiend hims~ei~.&#xD;
The sheri~ then speedily betook himself to the gallery.&#xD;
And saying ~o the other men: "Excuse me a moment,"&#xD;
Mr. Troup stopped into his wife's chamber, and requested.&#xD;
her to have dinner' prepared for the men, and also to have&#xD;
the carriage ordered, and to have evei'ything in readi-&#xD;
ness, ~o they could leave as soon as he transacted his&#xD;
business.&#xD;
Then returning to the men, they entered upon their&#xD;
mission silently and solemnly, for one dared not speak,&#xD;
and the other had no inclination for conversation.&#xD;
Never had Mr. Troup borne himself more grandly than&#xD;
on this occasion, and while the low creatures who followed&#xD;

at his heels hated him, they were compelled to admit&#xD;
his superiority, for they felt it.&#xD;
But his arrogance was subdued, his haughtiness was&#xD;
considerate, and had lie but conducted himself in pvos-&#xD;
perity half so well as he did in adversity, he would not&#xD;
now be a ruined mali, and our story would never have&#xD;
been told.&#xD;
Strange, isn't it, that with all the lights before us, ~v e&#xD;
still go on letting prosperity spoil us?&#xD;
Stranger still, isn't it, that we never can understand&#xD;
that of ourselves we arc nothing-that of ourselves we&#xD;
can do nothing?&#xD;
The unpleasant business ended, the men turned to go,&#xD;
when ~Jr. Troup said, politely and ~uthoritatiVCly:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, you will remain to dinner.'&#xD;
The friend upon the gallery was then called; and fol-&#xD;
lowing the late master into the dining-hall, which in years&#xD;
gone by had been the scene of so many magnificent ban~&#xD;
quets, they partook of a comfortable meal which Mrs. Troup&#xD;
had had prepared. The family portraits which adorned&#xD;
the walls had of course been reserved, and the fact that&#xD;
those handsome fi'amnes were not to be his, seriou~ ly in-&#xD;
terfered with Mr. Ilammerly's appetite. Certainly the&#xD;
haughty aristocrat was welcome to the pictureS, for Mr.&#xD;
ilammerly only wanted the frames, and he even ~vent&#xD;
into a calculation as to the probability of what they would&#xD;
bring if they were only touched up just a little. Thus it&#xD;
is clear to see that this man who had an eye to business,&#xD;
had no idea of squandering his money upon such a worth-&#xD;
less ~?) class of people as painters, or upon such a con-&#xD;
temptible ~?) art as that of Form and Color.&#xD;
Mrs. Troup did not, of coarse, preside at this dinner,&#xD;
&#xD;
but employed the time in saying "good-by" to such of&#xD;
the servants as were to be found at their "quarters," for&#xD;
most of them were out in the plantation at work.&#xD;
At length, sick at heart, and weary, she sought refuge&#xD;
in Aunt Charity's cottage-another one of those tradi-&#xD;
tional "IMammys," about whom so much has been said and&#xD;
written, but of whose faithful services and life-long de-&#xD;
votion not the half will ever be known. Pleading fa-&#xD;
tigue, she sank down upon a snowy bed, and gave vent&#xD;
to the tears which would no longer be repressed.&#xD;
"You be tired, honey, did you say?'? asked dear old&#xD;
"Aunt Charity," who sat, the veritable picture of com-&#xD;
fort and neatness, arrayed in a blue checked dress, with&#xD;
the inevitable ~white apron, cape, and cap, while lier&#xD;
glasses rested faithfully over eyes that would never enjoy&#xD;
another glimpse of this beautiful world. No answer&#xD;
coming from her mistress, the feeble old nurse, by the aid&#xD;
of a cane, hobbled to the bed; and hearing the low sobs,&#xD;
said kindly:&#xD;
"What be de matter, honey?"&#xD;
"Oh, Auiit Charity!" was all the heart-broken mis-&#xD;
tm~ess could say; but that told all that she suffered, and&#xD;
"A'unt Charity" brushed away a tear as she said:&#xD;
"Poor chile ~ dese is dark times, but if ye trusts in&#xD;
de Lord, lie will gib yer strength, to bear up under dern;"&#xD;
for "Amuit Charity" was, and had ever been, the comifi-&#xD;
dante\ of her mistress, and she knew that th~ hour of ruin&#xD;
had come at last.&#xD;
Soon forcing back the tears which she did not wish her&#xD;
l~umsband to see, Mrs. Troup said.:&#xD;
"Aunt Charity, we are going to-day, never to return.&#xD;
But as I told you, ~ were not included in the deed a&#xD;

&#xD;
.as soon as we get a house, we will send for you, and you&#xD;
are to come and stay with us as long as you live. Do&#xD;
you hear?"&#xD;
But the poor old soul was sobbing like a child, and&#xD;
eouhi not reply.&#xD;
"Say, Aunt Charity, do you hear?" again pressed her&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
"Yes, honey, provided de good Lord don't take me to&#xD;
dem mansions in de skies 'fore den."&#xD;
"Well, if He does, you'll be better off, for you know&#xD;
there's a crown awaiting you up there."&#xD;
here the conversation was interrupted by Mr. Troup,&#xD;
who, having turned the keys over to and dismissed the&#xD;
future possessor of the " Manor," came in search of his&#xD;
wife, in order to quit a place where it was now torture&#xD;
to remain. Once, not so very long ago, the son bad&#xD;
experienced the same painful feeling. Now, the father&#xD;
suffers the same torture. But the causes are vastly&#xD;
different, and not until that last hour did the late master&#xD;
realize:&#xD;
Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord."&#xD;
J3idding Aunt Charity "good-by," and telling her he&#xD;
would send for her soon, he slipped his wife's hand&#xD;
through his arm, and after a sobbing "God bless you"&#xD;
f~om the blind old creature, who clung to them as if they&#xD;
were parting forever, the master and mistress walked&#xD;
~adIy and slowly away. Following a little path that led&#xD;
to the family burying-ground, they noiselessly entered the&#xD;
gate, and walked amongst the tombs of their ancestors&#xD;
for generations back, for the husband and wife were&#xD;
cmsins. There were many silent sleepers there, for the&#xD;
hereditary foe, consumption, had made death a frequent&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
visitor in both families, and as usual, had singled out&#xD;
the brightest and most beautiful for its fatal ni~rk. Al-&#xD;
though unaffected by the tombs of the elder members of&#xD;
the family, when they arrived at the graves of their own&#xD;
little ones, the crushed pride of Mrs. Troup was all fur-&#xD;
gotten, the world, with its sneers was ignored, and the&#xD;
sobbing woman, who knelt and kissed the turf-covered,&#xD;
violet-decked mounds, beneath which rested her own&#xD;
flesh and blood, was only the-mother. The haughty&#xD;
father, too, was deeply moved, ~and this seemed strange,&#xD;
when we remember that he buried those little ones without&#xD;
a tear, and with a curse in his heart for the God who&#xD;
took them. And here we would ask why it is that pa-&#xD;
rents are so inconsolable for those little creatures, whom&#xD;
they know are taken from sorrow to come? Will they&#xD;
never appreciate-can they never understand-that their&#xD;
bereavement is a mercy to their offspring? Neither do&#xD;
we say this in a spirit ~f complaint or rebellion, for well&#xD;
we know that this ~vo~'ld is full of beauties for the pure,&#xD;
.f nil of pleasures fpr t~e virtuous. But we all know that&#xD;
the saintliest life iii u~t have its trials; and for this reason&#xD;
we would dry the ~ears1which' fall for the innocents whom&#xD;
God has given an~ wh~rn God has taken away. Stand-&#xD;
ing in the presence 6f the dead, and thinking of the&#xD;
dreary future before ~him, Mr. Troup thought what a re-&#xD;
lief it would be if he could add one more to their silent&#xD;
number. But to those who consider death a privilege,&#xD;
life is generally the boon which is given in ~ts stead, and&#xD;
to live was now the fate of Mr. Troup.&#xD;
At length the last' ~ad visit was over, and without, a&#xD;
word, father and mother walked slowly out from atnoug&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
their dead, and going down the lawn, entered the car-&#xD;
riage, which had been waiting for them some hours.&#xD;
A group of faithful servants stood around the carriage&#xD;
holding bundles, while the tears trickled down their&#xD;
dusky cheeks, for they loved their owners with a child-&#xD;
like devotion that was born of their very dependence.&#xD;
Placing the bundles in the ~carriage, several asked at&#xD;
once:&#xD;
"Mistis, can I do anything else for you?"&#xD;
"No, thank you;" tearfully.&#xD;
Then several others said eagerly:&#xD;
"Marster, is there anything else you wish done?"&#xD;
"Nothing," he answered; and with a hasty "good-&#xD;
by" for one and all, he said, "Drive on," and the corn-&#xD;
inand was obeyed.&#xD;
The house was bathed in a warm April sun, but the&#xD;
shutters were all closed, the doors were all locked, and it&#xD;
wore the dismal appearance of some grand mausoleum.&#xD;
And might it not be considered one? for if it ,did not&#xD;
contain dead bodies, it ~was the sepulchre of buried hopes&#xD;
-6f dreams born but to perish, and of unholy ambitions&#xD;
doomed to be fatal to him who nurtured. them.&#xD;
The grand old oaks cast their shadows long and dark,&#xD;
for the sun was low down the sky; the birds twittered&#xD;
merrily as they coq.uetted with their mates; the violets&#xD;
peeped timidly out from the grass; but the beauties were&#xD;
all lost upon the late master and mistress, for their&#xD;
hearts wer&amp;amp; breaking.&#xD;
Slowly, sadly, as if they had been following in the&#xD;
wake of some funeral train, did they drive down the&#xD;
aveiThe and out at the lodge-gate, without one parting&#xD;
look-for the wife was weeping upon her husband's&#xD;

AT LAST.                  275&#xD;
breast, and his hat was drawn down over his eyes to con~&#xD;
coal the tears which trickled down his ch6eks.&#xD;
Thus, "good-by" to the "Manor," and the question&#xD;
naturally arises, "Will we ever visit it again?"&#xD;

CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
OVER TUE SEA.&#xD;
~ COWARDS the end of May, a beautiful girl sat&#xD;
upon the deck of the Nautilus, which was&#xD;
anchored in sight of Liverpool.&#xD;
The scene was one of marvellous beauty; but she was&#xD;
not thinking of the docks towards which her glorious&#xD;
eyes were directed, nor of the city of manufactories,&#xD;
nor of the myriads of white sails that were visible, nor&#xD;
of the tiny boats that studded the Mer~ey, nor of iHitti&#xD;
who guided their ship into safety; but with the sea-&#xD;
breeze kissing her cheeks, she was dreaming of the Old&#xD;
World-that Mecca for which her soul had longed from&#xD;
childhood, and wondering if her feet were at last about&#xD;
to press its sacred soil; for in the moment of realization,&#xD;
the thought se~ ed too beautiful to be true.&#xD;
upon the lox~er deck, the gentlemen looked after the&#xD;
luggage, and always anxious to ~avoid a crush, their fair&#xD;
travelliug~cO1flPafliOn awaited them above.&#xD;
The past had no part or place in her reflections, and&#xD;
she wa~ almost sorry when the American Ambassador to&#xD;
the Court of St. James said:&#xD;
"Come, Gertrude, it is oar time now."&#xD;
"And the Captain is hurrying us like everything, for&#xD;
fear he ,will not get us all landed before dark," added&#xD;
Paul; and while he gathered up her wraps, she arose,&#xD;
and giving her hand to her uncle, descended with him to&#xD;
&#xD;
the tug that was to transfer them to the shore once&#xD;
more. For the trio were none others than our old friends,&#xD;
Mr. Reuben flail, Gertrude, and Paul.&#xD;
When last we saw them, they were upon the eve of a&#xD;
new Presidential inauguration. Well, the inauguration,&#xD;
with all of its usual accompaniments, wa~ now a thing of&#xD;
the past, and the honor of representing the United States&#xD;
Government as Minister to England, having been ten-&#xD;
dered to and accepted by the "Sage of Pleasant' Re-&#xD;
treat," he and suite were now en route to their new&#xD;
destination.&#xD;
Gertrude was still to occupy the post of private secrc~&#xD;
tary, while Paul weut as an attack6.&#xD;
The whole party had paid a flying visit to dear old&#xD;
Georgia for the piirpose of saying "good-by" to the&#xD;
loved ones, and at the suggestion ~f Mr. Hall, Mrs. Law-&#xD;
rence had rented her home in L-., in order to take&#xD;
charge of affairs at "Pleasant Retreat." Many were 'the&#xD;
people who marvelled at the good fortune that had be-&#xD;
fallen the "dressmaker's daughter," and all the "Sweet-&#xD;
hearts, Trays, Blanches," et id omne ~'enu~, sneered&#xD;
~at the idea of the Government sending that parvenu,&#xD;
Reuben Hall, to represent The American aristocracy (?)&#xD;
abroad.&#xD;
how sadly times have changed!!! Then, they wanted&#xD;
a gentleman; now, that is not considered a necessary&#xD;
requisite.&#xD;
Then, theywanted honesty in high places~.; now, unless&#xD;
a man knows how to stealL-.-beg pardon-unless he under-&#xD;
stands making the Government his debtor, he' might as&#xD;
well h'ang his harp upon the willow, and ~retire to the&#xD;
shades of private life. But no matter what the dear&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="278-279" xml:id="VAC8257-00000139"/>&#xD;
people wanted in those days, they got whatever the&#xD;
occupant of the White House gave them, for he was a&#xD;
man of his own mind, and not to be bought. So to Eng-&#xD;
land the Hon. Reuben Hall went, and if he could not&#xD;
opew and eat a soft-boiled egg in the shell quite as&#xD;
artistically as one of the "bloods" might have done, he&#xD;
did more, for he performed the duties of diylornat with&#xD;
credit to himself and honor to his country.&#xD;
After an unsatisfactory night at Liverpool, our travellers&#xD;
took the express train to London, and passing through a&#xD;
highly cultivated country, reached the city of fogs the&#xD;
same night.&#xD;
The term of the officiating Minister not having yet ex-&#xD;
pired, Mr. Hall contemplated a visit on the Continent;&#xD;
but as Gertrude had not encouraged the trip very much,&#xD;
and as l~e found himself daily more and more dependent&#xD;
upon this truly noble woman, lie thought he would con-&#xD;
s4t her once more; and abide by her decision. So,' a&#xD;
day or' two after their arrival in London, he said:&#xD;
"Well, Gertrude, what do you say to a trip on the Con-&#xD;
tinent?"&#xD;
"Ii leave it entirely to you, uncle;" rather indifferently.&#xD;
"Which means, ii suppose, II don't care' to go, dear&#xD;
vncle, but will do as you wish."&#xD;
"Not at all, for I certainly hope to visit Italy before&#xD;
we return."&#xD;
"Italy?" said the uncle in surprise.&#xD;
"Yes. y nOt?"&#xD;
"Nothing," he answered smilingly, " only Pm surprised&#xD;
,you did not select Paris, for I thought that was considered&#xD;
the women's Paradise."&#xD;
"And why?&#xD;
&#xD;
278&#xD;
&#xD;
C( I'm sure I don't know! Enlighten me! ".&#xD;
"That they may dress, ride in the Boi8, and listen to&#xD;
gallant speeches from flippant, soulless Frenchmen."&#xD;
"You are rather severe upon the race of cavaliers;"&#xD;
but without noticing his reply, sl~ said, with much&#xD;
earnestness:&#xD;
"Uncle, I have told you before, and I tell you again,&#xD;
that it is my desire to study and know the English char-&#xD;
acter, for I would like to know what secret power it is&#xD;
which makes them so vastly superior to all other nations.&#xD;
For this purpose I should like to spend most of&#xD;
in England; an'd I assure you, I wouldn't give Qn~d~yiu&#xD;
London, with all its traditional fog, for forty da~)sf~pent&#xD;
in the whirl of the mad metropolis."&#xD;
Always anxious to draw her out, so that he might&#xD;
know time exact motives which guided her life and act~ns,&#xD;
Mr. Hall said:&#xD;
"And why do you wish to study the English character,&#xD;
Gertrude?"&#xD;
"That I may imitate them," was the frank reply.&#xD;
"What! are you not satisfied with the Amnei'ican mode&#xD;
of doing things?"&#xD;
"I think, considering our age, that we have accom-&#xD;
plished wonders; and judging the future by the past, I do&#xD;
not doubt but that we are destined to become the grand:&#xD;
est nation on the globe; but there is one great defect in&#xD;
our national character."&#xD;
"What is that?"&#xD;
"We live for the present and not for the future.&#xD;
Whatever 'we do, we do in a hurry. We go to work as&#xD;
if we had only a day to live, while aim Englishman is as&#xD;
deliberate as if he' had a thousand years before him."&#xD;

"Any time that suits -you, dear uncle, suits me."&#xD;

CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
HUsH I I I&#xD;
READ softly I leave the gay world, quit the&#xD;
bright sunshine, and come with us to the chain..&#xD;
ber of death, for it is there we all must come&#xD;
at last.&#xD;
We know you scarcely have the time to spare, we feel&#xD;
that you follow us reluctantly, for an impatient frown&#xD;
rests upon youl'. brow, and down in your heart a voice&#xD;
whispers, "Life is too short for such doleful scenes as&#xD;
this"&#xD;
But We will not detain you. long, for the Angel of&#xD;
Death is in cruel haste to bear our sweet flower away,&#xD;
and even now is clutching her in his icy grasp. What&#xD;
was wealth-what were prosperity, luxury, friends, es~&#xD;
tates worth in that hour?&#xD;
The frantic parents would have thrown all their treas-&#xD;
ures into the yawning grave, and like Curtius, would&#xD;
have cast themselves in, if the chasm would close over&#xD;
them alone, and spare their child. They said to~ them&#xD;
selves, "We are old; our race is nearly run; take us, and&#xD;
leave our darling;" 'but Cod knew best, and he took the&#xD;
flower in its springtime.&#xD;
How calm and beautiful she looks! and her little one&#xD;
~ieeps as quietly in thi crib over which "IMlamnmy"&#xD;
watches, as if it would not be motherless in a few more&#xD;
houvs.&#xD;

&#xD;
Poor Mrs. Daring sits on one side the bed, altdi~&#xD;
lately wiping away her tears, and stroking the pale,&#xD;
white brow of her child; Clifford kneels on the other side,&#xD;
rubbing the transparent little hands, thus trying to bring&#xD;
back their warmth; but the blood is settling around the I&#xD;
nails, and They are growing colder each moment; this&#xD;
task is in vain; and the father sits with his back to this&#xD;
scene, crushed and heart-broken.&#xD;
The chamber is darkened to keep out the noonday gnu;&#xD;
but there is still light enough for us to see the sweet res-&#xD;
ignation upon the brow of the little blue-eyed wife; the&#xD;
agonized expression upon the face of the mother, the&#xD;
dejection and despair of the father, and the utter contri-&#xD;
tion and self-reproach which bows the hfisband in heart-&#xD;
brokemi humility to the earth.&#xD;
That last hour is scarcely mere trying to the one who&#xD;
is entering upon the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death&#xD;
thati it is to those who are left behind; for even if we&#xD;
have been kind and loving and attentive, it will be an&#xD;
hour of suffering; but when we have neglected and&#xD;
slighted the on.~ who is going from us forever, when we&#xD;
feel that perhaps we have broken the heart that is throb-&#xD;
bing its last throbs, self-reproaches will accuse us bitterly,&#xD;
and when it is too late, we will plead: "Ol~, God, give&#xD;
her back to me! spare her, and I will try and make her&#xD;
happy." Thus did Clifford feel, and thus will others of us&#xD;
feel, one day, when the leaf is folded back, and we see&#xD;
writteim upon time page of life the record of duties unper-&#xD;
forirmed. The dear old doctor was there, too, and to the&#xD;
ott-repeated question of the agonized niotimer:&#xD;
"Doctor, can you not save her?" he said, at last:&#xD;
"She mrtay possible inger until night."&#xD;
&#xD;

Then he came into the room and felt the puke of his&#xD;
"little Jeannie" again, and turning to him, she said,&#xD;
calmly:&#xD;
"flow long, doctor?"&#xD;
With a sigh he turned away without replying; then she&#xD;
said again:&#xD;
"Don't deceive me, doctor. I know.I am dying, and I&#xD;
have a reason for asking how long I have to live." her&#xD;
voice was very weak but it- did not falter; for she was&#xD;
not afraid to die. Still the doctor stood with his back&#xD;
to her and made no reply; then she said again:&#xD;
"Doctor, come here;" and when he came and took the&#xD;
thin, little hand that she extended to him, she sa~id once&#xD;
more, "Why do you not answer me? Youi never treated&#xD;
me so before, and it may be the lasI~ request I shall ever&#xD;
make of you; then tell me, how long can II possibly live?"&#xD;
INo longer able to resist her pleadings, he said hurriedly&#xD;
but solemnly:&#xD;
"Possibly until night;" and pressing her hand, wali~ed&#xD;
slowly out. of the room to hide his tears.&#xD;
"Then, dear mother, will you and father and 'Main-&#xD;
my,' please leave me alone with Clifford for a little&#xD;
while?"&#xD;
"Oh, my child, don't send us away," pleaded the dis-&#xD;
tracted mother, as she yielded to the first great outburst&#xD;
~f grief.&#xD;
"It will be only for a little while, mother."&#xD;
"But in tha~t little while you might~-~----;" but h~r lips&#xD;
refused to speak the dreaded word.&#xD;
"Yes, dear mother, I might die then; but your staying&#xD;
will not k9ep. me,~ and2 as IL have only so short a time, grant&#xD;

&#xD;
me this last request, and leave me with my husband for a&#xD;
few moments."&#xD;
At length, yielding to this heart-rending appeal, the&#xD;
mother . kissed her one little treasure, as if parting from&#xD;
her forever, and was then led away by Mamnmy and&#xD;
"fatlaer," while their sobs filled the room. Reaching the&#xD;
door, she turned, screamed, and rushing back, folded her&#xD;
child in her arms once more, and kissing her frantically, -&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Don't be long, darling; don't keep mother away;"&#xD;
and with the assurance of&#xD;
"INo, mother, I will not," she went weeping from the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
Turning to her husband then, Virginia said:&#xD;
"Close the door, Clifford, and hand me nmy writing-&#xD;
desk."&#xD;
She was very much agitated, and her poor little broken&#xD;
heart was palpitating fearfully with the exertion of this-&#xD;
last effort.&#xD;
Fortunately, Clifford did not notice it; and complying&#xD;
with her request, he resumed his seat, and silently awaited,&#xD;
with an ill-defined dread, something, he knew not what.,&#xD;
Forgetting for the moment how sacredly the desk was&#xD;
kept locked, the wee wife sipiled and said faintly: "11&#xD;
forgot it was locked. Please, Clifford, look in my top&#xD;
bureau drawer, in the right~.hand corner,- and you'll find&#xD;
a little key tied with a piece of blue ribbon."&#xD;
The key was found, the desk unlocked, and taking from -&#xD;
it with trembling fingers a letter which was sealed and&#xD;
addressed, she said falteringly:&#xD;
"Clifford, in this letter, you will find my-dying---.-. -&#xD;
request."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
A struggle for breath, and an effort to lorce back the&#xD;
tears which Would come, made her hesitate; but it was&#xD;
only for a few minutes, for she was determined that nodi-&#xD;
ing should 'keep her from the fulfilment of this last s~d&#xD;
duty. Clifford looked the picture of despair as he sat&#xD;
with his head bowed upon both hands, and only God&#xD;
above knew what remorse filled his heart in that painful&#xD;
*    hour.&#xD;
A few moments of rest, and the dying wife continued:&#xD;
"One year from to-day I wish you to open this letter&#xD;
*     and ~do what I have here asked you 'to do.&#xD;
It is nothing but what you can do, and I feel sure-d&#xD;
hope-I pray-it is ~oinething whioli will make you&#xD;
happy."&#xD;
At the word "happy," he trembled visibly, and in-&#xD;
stinctively he felt that his secret had been. discovered.&#xD;
"In it also you will find the name I desire our little&#xD;
one to bear, ~h~~ld e live."&#xD;
Then drawing his ha ds gently from his face, she p1a~ed&#xD;
the letter therein, and aid earnestly:&#xD;
"I have one other request to malie, Clifford;" to which&#xD;
he sighed, but said, nothing.&#xD;
"I asl~ you to promise me that you will never take an-&#xD;
other ddnk-"&#xD;
A long pause followed this request, and the expression&#xD;
upon the thin, pale face of the leader deepened to pain-&#xD;
ful anxiety as she waited; then she said again:&#xD;
"Do you promise ? "&#xD;
Another agonizing suspense, and then the awful silence&#xD;
was broken by the manly tones , of her husband, and her&#xD;
face became radiant with hbpe, as he said firmly:&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
287&#xD;
&#xD;
"I do 1" for she knew his "word was his bond," and&#xD;
she knew he would keep his promise.&#xD;
"I have not lived in vain, then," she said, laying her&#xD;
head back on the pillow, and closing her eyes in utter ex-&#xD;
haustion; "and iiow, I can die in peace." Then, after a&#xD;
few moments of rest, she opened her eyes and said:&#xD;
"Draw back the curtains and let the sunlight come in,&#xD;
Clifford-and call father ~nd mother--and let me kiss our&#xD;
little one once more--" for her shortness of breath and her&#xD;
failing sti~ength told her she was sinking rapidly.&#xD;
Ignoring her requests, and forgetting everything but the&#xD;
dying woman before him, he crie&amp;amp;with a voice whose&#xD;
agony pierced her heart:&#xD;
"Oh, Virginia, my wife; I cannot let you die, until I&#xD;
ask you to forgive me;" and lifting her fragile form in his&#xD;
arms, he pressed her to his heart, where she nestled her&#xD;
head, and said:&#xD;
"Forgive you, dear-Clifford?"&#xD;
"My God-yes-forgive me!" but her head drooped,&#xD;
her eyes closed, her lips faltered: "Mother-.~father-Olif-&#xD;
ord--b~by," and then-she was no more.&#xD;
"Virginia 1" came in one wild, despairing cry; it pen-&#xD;
etrated the house, but it could not awakeii the dead. The&#xD;
door opened, the ~frantic parents rushed in, followed by&#xD;
the doctor and a score of faithful servants; but it was&#xD;
too late; no restoratives, no tears, no wailing could re-&#xD;
call her now, for she was safely anchored in th6 haven of&#xD;
eternal rest. Was &amp;amp;ver heroism more grand-was ever&#xD;
martyrdom more complete?&#xD;

URNED to the ground! I"&#xD;
"What?"&#xD;
"Why, the 'Manor!' Had you not heard it?"&#xD;
"No; how did it happen?"&#xD;
"No one knows; but it is whispered that the old Troup&#xD;
negroes did it!"&#xD;
"What for?"&#xD;
"To revenge themselves upon their new master for his&#xD;
brutal treatment to them; and by the way, I hear he&#xD;
narrowly escaped with his life, and is quite badly burned."&#xD;
7 "Pity he hadn't been burned to death, for that is too&#xD;
K. good a death for such ~a brute as he is. Why, do you&#xD;
know that that man has been working those negroes not&#xD;
only from daylight to dark, but upon moonlight nights&#xD;
makes them pick cotton until midnight."&#xD;
"Impossible! The reports must be exaggerated !"&#xD;
"I have seen it myself, and I hear that he has reduced&#xD;
their rations to barely enough of the coarsest diet to sus-&#xD;
tam life, and that he allows them to go in such rags and&#xD;
tatters that their nakedness is not hid."&#xD;
"A sad change from the treatment of the Troups, for&#xD;
in their day their negroes were pampered and indulged&#xD;
almost to idleness. Who is this ilammerly, anyhow?"&#xD;
"A mere adventurer; no body knows who or where&#xD;
&#xD;
he came from, and to wind up with, a most unscrupulous&#xD;
money-getter?"&#xD;
" Such mcii are not fit to have the control of human&#xD;
beings, for they do not understand th~ difference between&#xD;
~nen and brutes ; both are alike driven for the almighty&#xD;
dollar."&#xD;
"Yes; I am more and more convinced that none but&#xD;
Southern people who have been accustomed to them, but&#xD;
more especially, gentlemen, should have the control of&#xD;
negroes. For instance, take a man who, all his life, has&#xD;
been accustomed to doing menial labor, and he will make&#xD;
I the most unfeeling tyrant, should he ever have any one&#xD;
under him in the same capacity. In other Words, he has&#xD;
no sympathy with the class from which he caine. On the&#xD;
other hand, take a gentleman, and he will treat his slaves,&#xD;
* with kindness and consideration, simply because they are&#xD;
in his power."&#xD;
Thus talked two of the neighbors at. Tate's, a cross-&#xD;
roads store near the "Manor," the day ~mfter the fire.&#xD;
It was now October, four months since the occurrence&#xD;
of the sad events recorded in the last chapter, and as we&#xD;
see, the cruelties of the new master of the "Manor" had&#xD;
met with a terrible, but justly deserved retribution-for&#xD;
no man has any right, morally speaking, to grind another&#xD;
man into the earth, simply because he can ~do it-and we&#xD;
do not doubt but that this act of cruel injustice will meet&#xD;
with its reward in a~orda1)ce with the Divine precept:&#xD;
"As ye mete, so shall it be meted to you again."&#xD;
But Ilammerly, like other upstarts who suddei~ly and&#xD;
unscrupulously grow rich, began to appreciate this fact&#xD;
just one day too'late, for the "Manor" was in a~lmes, and&#xD;
no amount of penitence could~~ bring back the treasures&#xD;

The daughters occasionally sent a donation from their&#xD;
own private purses, but the combined sums from every&#xD;
source were insufficient to supply the expensive luxur-.&#xD;

credit of the honorable gentleman being a thing of the&#xD;
past, of course the cash had to be paid for every pur-&#xD;

Add to this expense, fuel, provisions, house-rent, and&#xD;
servants' hire, besides all the little details of housekeep-.&#xD;

went out than it came in; f6r there w~s no one to turn&#xD;
the wheel of necessity, and yet it kept turning all the time.&#xD;
Too proud to let he~rVhildren know she was suffering,&#xD;
Mrs. Troup from tiii~ to time disposed of her jewels,&#xD;
then her laces, then what little silver was left, and still&#xD;
he cried:&#xD;
"More, more," until the wretched wife was almost&#xD;
frantic, and until she feared he must and would die.&#xD;
But it seemed the design of Provideii. e that he should&#xD;
live, and that he should suffer, and no earthly power&#xD;
could save him from drinking the same bitter draughts&#xD;
which lie had held so mercilessly to the lips of others.&#xD;
Friends walked by on th~ othei side, relatives ignored,&#xD;
children deserted, and the heart-broken ~wife was left&#xD;
alone in 11 er anguish to minister to the wants of him for&#xD;
whom she would gladly have borne every sorrow.' But&#xD;

CHAPTER XLV.1&#xD;
BACK IN LONDON.&#xD;
lUll the early days of October, our tourists re-&#xD;
turned from the Continent to London, and settled&#xD;
themselves comfortably for the winter.&#xD;
TL~ Ambassador, being much occupied with affairs of&#xD;
State, placed his private secretary under the special care&#xD;
of his attach, giving him positive orders to "show her&#xD;
everything in London, without reserve.~~&#xD;
In obeying this comman~1, Pud placed himself and all&#xD;
his leisure time entirely at Gertrude's disposal, and it is&#xD;
scarcely necessary to add that he was only too happy to be&#xD;
so enslaved.&#xD;
Thus day after day went by, and together they visited&#xD;
the worl&amp;amp;renowned Westminster; together they trod the&#xD;
gloomy cells of the tragic Tower; together they listened&#xD;
to the speeches of the Lords and Crnimoners; together&#xD;
they were thrilled by the music of the finest operas; to-&#xD;
gether they dived into dens of poverty, and rescued its&#xD;
wretched victims from the jaws of death; together they&#xD;
went everywhere, saw eVerything; and is it strange that&#xD;
Paul became more and mere infatuated with his beau~&#xD;
tiful companion, as time drifted on?&#xD;
Pu t he never told her of this great love; and thinking&#xD;
he ha entirely recovered from his past fancy, Gertrude&#xD;
treated him in an unceremQnious, confidential way, which&#xD;
but se ved to increase his devotion.&#xD;

BACK IN L0NDON~&#xD;
&#xD;
She was his thought by day andYight; he cared fo~' no&#xD;
other society, and his world was centre in her.&#xD;
He was an enthusiast over her music; lie studied&#xD;
Finch with her; together they read all manner of&#xD;
books; and it was the double effort of his life to antici-&#xD;
pate her wishes, and to do whatever lie imagined would&#xD;
give her pleasure.&#xD;
Eaiiy in the season, Mr. Hall said:&#xD;
"And you think you can resist the fascinations of&#xD;
London society, Gertrude?"&#xD;
"Indeed I can, uncle, and without an effort, for I do&#xD;
not intend ~to be tempted."&#xD;
"Alit but you will reserve no credit for resisting a&#xD;
temptation of which you know nothing'"&#xD;
"Well, then, I will agree to attend just ~uc1i enter-&#xD;
tainments as you suggest."&#xD;
"Suppose I should be very exacting in my sugges-&#xD;
tions? ",&#xD;
"But IL do not fear that, when you knows well how I&#xD;
feel oii the subject."&#xD;
"You are quite right, child; for I am sure I would be&#xD;
the last person in the world to give you a moment of&#xD;
discomfort."&#xD;
"I suspect that most of my dissipation will be confined&#xD;
to the opera, whither Paul has kindly consented to take&#xD;
me whenever I wish to go;" and looking smilingly up,&#xD;
the referred-to young gentleman said:&#xD;
"Certainly, with only too much pleasure."&#xD;
Then, mischievously, Mr. Hall said:&#xD;
"Gertrude, I declare I think it is very selfish of you&#xD;
to monopolize Paul so. He must be bored to death."&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
"Are you?" she said, wfth the least bit of coquetry,&#xD;
and a smile no man on earth could resist.&#xD;
"Of course," he answered; but by the tone of voice she&#xD;
knew well enough he meant "Of course not."&#xD;
"Ppromised to present him to the daughters of~rny&#xD;
friend, Lord Ilampden; but I suppose I shal~~ve to ask&#xD;
your perrriission, or wait, at least, until you ca~ release&#xD;
him from his numerous engagements with you."&#xD;
"He is at liberty to go whenever he chooses, and I am&#xD;
quite sure I have no power of keeping him, even if I. were&#xD;
selfish enough to desire to dQ so."&#xD;
her face was the least bit troubled, and she felt a little&#xD;
yiqu~ at the idea of being a bore. What woman&#xD;
wouldn't;? especially a pretty one.&#xD;
Seeing this, Paul hastened to say:&#xD;
"Gertrude, I wouldn't resign the pleasure of attending&#xD;
you wherever you wished to go, for all the daughters (.)f&#xD;
all the lords in England."&#xD;
He did not mean to be so warm, but his words could&#xD;
nQt be recalled now, and as they brought the blushes to&#xD;
Gertrude's cheeks, they sent a thrill of joy to the Ainbas-&#xD;
sador's heart. Why? We know, you and I, for we&#xD;
know that he had not yet- abandoned the old dream of&#xD;
more than a year ago; but in their innocence, hisprot~g6s&#xD;
failed to see that he was only drawing them out, and try-&#xD;
ing, if possible, to sound the secret depths of their respec-&#xD;
tive hearts.&#xD;
"how very complimentary you are to the English no-&#xD;
bility I." said Mr. ilall, after -a good laugh at Paul's en-&#xD;
thusiasm.&#xD;
"Yes; considering how much they value the opinions&#xD;
of Americans, they wohld, doubtless, feel very much-&#xD;

&#xD;
slighted to know that an American prefers one of his own&#xD;
coimtrywomen without any 'blood,' to all the hereditary&#xD;
aristocracy of 2i~ngland."&#xD;
"Doubtless," answered Mr. Hall, with a poor attempt&#xD;
to eoiiceal the sympathetic smile which these ~words&#xD;
elicited.&#xD;
"213ut I insist, gaul, that you do as my ,unc~e desires,&#xD;
and I will not go out with you again until you have paid&#xD;
your respects to 'the daughters of my Lord Ilampden.'"&#xD;
This was said with such determination, that the gentle-&#xD;
men understood the ftctt wa~~ be obeyed, and laughing,&#xD;
Mr. Hall said:&#xD;
"So ho, my young man, you have your orders."&#xD;
To which, with an air of utter resignation, and evi-&#xD;
dently wishing the ~ daughters of my Lord Ilampden"&#xD;
at the bottom of the sea, Paul said;&#xD;
"When shall we make the propQsed visit?"&#xD;
"We will have to write and consult the pleasui'e of&#xD;
their ladyships," answered the Ambassador, who seemed&#xD;
quite amused to see his young friend so tensed.&#xD;
"Their ladyships," said Paul with a sneer; and cer-&#xD;
tainly, if the Misses llainpden had known how they were&#xD;
discussed by this obscure American, they would have died&#xD;
of auger, or else closed their aristocratic doQrs ag~iiist&#xD;
the vile intruder forever.&#xD;
How many of the dear creat~ires share a similar fate to&#xD;
that of the Misses Ilampden, and how many poor men&#xD;
are dragged to see women whom they do not care to&#xD;
know, is really melancholy to contemplate; but we sup-&#xD;
pose, so long as the ladies remain in blissful ignorance, it&#xD;
does not matter?&#xD;
There's one ~cons~lation, t~ngh, for femiuiuity in this&#xD;
&#xD;
affair, for the p~8tprandia1 part of the feast belongs ex-&#xD;
clusively to their sex; and, believe us, it is not always&#xD;
daintily served ~in Iiorno~opathic doses, like caf~-noir. The&#xD;
quality may 1~e the same, for it will be strong, but the&#xD;
quantity will lastly outweigh that of the antidote, which&#xD;
rectifies a little over-indulgence.&#xD;
Thus it is barely possible that while some notorious&#xD;
lady-kilier is rehearsing before his mirror the very looks,&#xD;
the ~vords, the attitudes, which his ~Pity tells him so&#xD;
overwhelmingly captivated Miss 13 ,that that same&#xD;
Miss B-- and her "dear Elvira," upstairs in their&#xD;
wrappers, shivering over a handful of coals, are at the&#xD;
same hour picking him to pieces in genuine feminine&#xD;
style-which means, not to leave a feather on his back.&#xD;
So things are aI)out equal in this world, and after all, Uie&#xD;
law of compensation seems more, evenly balanced than~&#xD;
the scales of just~ce.&#xD;
Such conversations as these were daily held in the&#xD;
home of Mr. hall, over which his lovely niec~ presided&#xD;
with so much grace and dignity; and we doubt if there&#xD;
was a happier fireside to be found in the great, throbb4ing,&#xD;
pulsing city of London.&#xD;
'The Ambassador had long since gone to hisAuties, and&#xD;
fulfilling an engagement, Gertiude and Paul went to&#xD;
visif some wretchedly poor and suffering people, in whose&#xD;
behalf this noble girl was interesting herself.&#xD;
Upon their return, as there was no special writing, to&#xD;
be done that day, they sat down before a cosey fire, to&#xD;
continue the reading of that fascinating book, that beau-&#xD;
tiful dream, that romance without a parallel-" Contarini&#xD;

into the gardens of the villa unperceived. I coi~dd. see&#xD;
no lights in the building. From this I inferred that&#xD;
Alceste was, perhaps, oply paying a farewell visit to her&#xD;
father's house. I ran along thQ terrace; I observed no&#xD;
one. I gained the chapel; I instinctively trod very&#xD;
lightly. I glanced in at the window. I perceived a form&#xD;
kneeling before the altar. There was a single candle.&#xD;
The kneeling figure leaned back with clasped hands.&#xD;
The light fell upon the countenance. I beheld the face&#xD;
of Al5este Contarini. I opened the door gently, but it&#xD;
roused her. I entered.&#xD;
I come,' I said, 'to claim my bride.' She screamed,&#xD;
she jumped upon the altar, and clung to the great&#xD;
ebony cross. lit was the same figure and the same atti~&#xD;
tude that I beheld in my vision in the church. 'Al-&#xD;
ceste,' IL said, 'you are mine. There is no power in&#xD;
heaven or earth, there is no infernal influence that can&#xD;
preVent you from being mine. You are as much part of&#xD;
me as this arm with which I now embrace you.' I tore&#xD;
her from the cross, I carried her fainting form out of the&#xD;
chapel.&#xD;
"'The moon had risen. I rested on a bank, and watched&#xD;
with blended passion and anxiety her ~closed eyesl She&#xD;
was motionless, and her white arms drooped down appar-&#xD;
ently without life. She breathed, yes! she breathed.&#xD;
That large eye opened, and darkened into light. She&#xD;
gazed around with an air ~of vacancy. A smile, a faint,&#xD;
6weet smile played upon her face. She slightly stretched&#xD;
&#xD;
her beautiful frame, as if again to feel her existence, and&#xD;
moved her beautiful arms, as if to try whether she yet&#xD;
retained power over her limbs. Again she smiled, and&#xD;
exclaiming.' Contarini ! threw them around my neck.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
AImLES!&#xD;
&#xD;
+ISTLESSLY rising up in the morning simply be-&#xD;
cause it was the custom-going mechanically to&#xD;
perform the same duties day after day--silently&#xD;
turning away from intercourse with his fellow-men-ly-&#xD;
ing down at night to remorse and sleeplessness-pale and&#xD;
haggard, with now and then a hectic flush upon his cheeks&#xD;
and a hollow cough which made one0 shudder, do yOul&#xD;
recognize the pictures Would you dream that this was&#xD;
the happy, buoyant, proud, and ambitious Clifford Troup,&#xD;
to whom we introduced you a little less' than -two years&#xD;
ago? Well may you exclaim: "What a wreck !" for&#xD;
the friends who saw him daily could scarcely believe it&#xD;
possible that even the combination of mental and physi-&#xD;
cal disease could have made such inroads in so brief a&#xD;
space.' True, the time' had been short, but the work was&#xD;
effectual.&#xD;
His arm, which had. never healed, was- of course an&#xD;
additional drain upon a system already' enervated, and&#xD;
since the hereditary foe of his ancestors had assailed him,&#xD;
he succumbed rapidly to the .combined ravages of a&#xD;
"rooted borrow " and an incurable disease. His physi-&#xD;
cian ordered him to Florida, but he always ansivered:&#xD;
"It is only for a little while, doctor; and besides, I&#xD;
have business which must be attended to."&#xD;
&#xD;
tus, lie gave himself a living sacrifice to that father&#xD;
wh~ had immolated him upon the altar of pride, upon the&#xD;
ide~ of Aoblesse obligJe.&#xD;
Strange caprice of fortune, was it noti&#xD;
.lSut for the simultaneous assault of both misfortune and&#xD;
disease, it is possible Clifford might have bound up his&#xD;
wounds and presented a smiling face to the world, as so&#xD;
many others do.&#xD;
As we have seen, though, one unfortunate event fol-&#xD;
lowed so closely after time other, that lhe had not time to&#xD;
recover from one before some new calamity was upon&#xD;
him; or at~ least he regarded them as calamities, and so&#xD;
will we all consider the inevitable trials of life, until we&#xD;
learn to bow meekly, and say: " Thy will be done."&#xD;
SHis physician time and again suggested a stimulant,&#xD;
but faithful to the promise made to the dead, he told him&#xD;
he could nof take it.&#xD;
" But you must," said the doctor ; " I presci'ibe it as a&#xD;
"Itven granting you do, doctor, I cannot take it !"&#xD;
Thus ended every discussion on the subject; and tort-&#xD;
ured| by suffering, this man, whose hopes were over,&#xD;
whose life was wrecked in the spring-time, returned&#xD;
each day with weary but unflagging devotion to his self-&#xD;
imposed miartyrdom. lHe had rented the cottage of lIM rs.&#xD;
Lawrence, and thei-e he lived solitary and alone. Why&#xD;

he had done it he cquld not tell, ~nd that it was an tin.&#xD;
wise step will at once be seen; for the memory (Yf happy&#xD;
by-gones ~which it constantly aroused, ~mly rendered the&#xD;
present darker, and added fresh thorns to the crown which&#xD;
daily pierced his aching brow. One day, however, he was&#xD;
aroused from this apathy by the news of ~irs, Dearing's&#xD;
death, and in the same letter which hronght this sad in-&#xD;
telligence, was a request from Mr. .Uearing's lawyer for&#xD;
the son-in-law to come and look after the "old man,"&#xD;
whom the writer said he "feared ~ ould not survive his&#xD;
wife long." Then he added: "The po~ mother died of a&#xD;
broken heart, if there is such a disease', never liaviiig loft&#xD;
~Xer room since Virginia's death, an I ref using utterly to&#xD;
be comforted for her lost lamb. The old man sits fr9rn&#xD;
morning until night in one spot, wth his head resting&#xD;
upon his hands, which are folded ou Us cane, and some-&#xD;
times for days does not tas4e food. The baby, under&#xD;
Marnmy's care, thrives well, and is tht~ only creature about&#xD;
the place that seems tp have any life left."&#xD;
Thus two more beings drifted dowii the stream of life,&#xD;
aimless and purposeless, and who shall say what is to be&#xD;
the end.&#xD;
Upon his arrival at "Mossy Creek," Glifford found thb&#xD;
old man in such a state of imbecility that he at once&#xD;
assumed the reins of government, and it was well for all&#xD;
parties concerned that he did. That it met the approval&#xD;
of his father-inlaw, was evident; foi whenever Clifford&#xD;
was leaving the house, he wonPd look up, and calling to&#xD;
him, say:&#xD;
"Don't go away," and when assured that he would not,&#xD;
down again the gray head would go upon the hands, and&#xD;
the monotonous life of this poor, bereft old creature&#xD;
&#xD;
804&#xD;
&#xD;
would continue its aimless pulsations. This new life&#xD;
was a change for Clifford, and while the place constantly&#xD;
recalled the most painful memories, which he would&#xD;
have buried forever out of sight, yet the society of his&#xD;
little one, to whoiii lie was as yet a stranger, was, a&#xD;
soothing balm for him, and his poor gashed and bleeding&#xD;
heart began to expand once more wjth the love which&#xD;
hi3 little "Birdie" called into existence.&#xD;
She was now eight or nine months old, and soon came&#xD;
to know her father well, so that she would cry when he&#xD;
went away, and her blue eyes would sparkle, her baby&#xD;
lips would smile, and she would hold out her little arms&#xD;
to go to him upon his return.&#xD;
The abject loneliness of heart whicix be had suffered&#xD;
was gone now, and the sweet knowledge that he was&#xD;
loved by his own flesh and blood brought, once inoi'e, the&#xD;
light to his eyes, and filled his being with a strange, new&#xD;
thrill of joy. It was not the happiness of other days,&#xD;
when life was just opening before 8 rose-tinted future,&#xD;
but it was the thankfulness that there was anything left&#xD;
to a heart which had abandoned itself to~ the sati fate it&#xD;
could not avert.. In these days, he thought he should like&#xD;
to live for this little one, so that he might shield her&#xD;
from the rude blasts whkh be feared would assail her.&#xD;
And so night after night, when he laid her in her little&#xD;
crib, and kissed her until ~he would ~~ry out and light off&#xD;
the kisses with her tiny fists, lie would go down upon his&#xD;
knees, and pray to Go&amp;amp; for her welfare and happiness..&#xD;
Then he would beg so humbly to be spared to rear her&#xD;
properly, and ih his heart he vowed, by the ineinor~i of&#xD;
the mother whom he had so deeply il)jIU'ed, to devote&#xD;

in his, he kissed them fervently.&#xD;
She made no reply, but only blushed and looked down,&#xD;
and Paul said again, with an earnestness which would&#xD;
have moved a heart of stone:&#xD;
"Gertrude, you know how long, h~w \ devotedly, how&#xD;
utterly I have loved you. Is there no hope for me? Am&#xD;
I to go on loving and waiting forever?" and his heart&#xD;
beat louct and fast as he searched her face for a ~ply.&#xD;

straight in the eyes, and said:&#xD;
"Paul, you would not be satisfied with a second love."&#xD;
"I will be satisfied with anything you give me," was&#xD;

"Yes," with a sigh and an expressio;-t of pain upon his&#xD;

have gone out of my life, and that there is nothing left&#xD;
in my heart but ashes?"&#xD;
"Give me the ashes 1" he answered quickly, and with&#xD;
a pleading tone, as though pleading for his life.&#xD;
"A poor exchange for such love a~ y@urs."&#xD;
"If I am satisfied, why should you care? And you do&#xD;
love me as a friend'?"&#xD;
"Yes, dearly; but that is not the kind of love ~or hus~.&#xD;
band and wife."&#xD;
"But you will love me by and by, f~r I shall love you&#xD;
&#xD;
so dearly that you cannot* help it. And besides, you do&#xD;
not love any one else now?"&#xD;
"And 'you will be mine?" he said eagerly. But his&#xD;
heart sank within him, as no reply caine to gladden it.&#xD;
I1owever,~VC have heard that renewed assaults would&#xD;
carry the strongest foi'ts, and by the result we see that&#xD;
this maxim cail 1)0 applied to affairs of the heart as well&#xD;
as to the incidents of war.&#xD;
Thus, after a long siege, the enemy capitulated, and&#xD;
judging from appearances, Mrs. Paul Maxwell had for-&#xD;

the kind of love fom~ a husband and wife."&#xD;

CHAPTER XLVIII.&#xD;
READ I I I&#xD;
AY again I I&#xD;
Another year gone--another twelve months of&#xD;
births -deaths--~-.-marriages---of clouds and sun~.&#xD;
shine,-.--of happiness and misery!&#xD;
A short time in which to crowd the comic and tragic&#xD;
events which mark the coining and going of each day&#xD;
with alternate smiles arkd tears. Clifford and "Birdie"&#xD;
were now the only watchers by the desolate hearth at&#xD;
"Mossy Creek," for the old man had joined the silent&#xD;
sleepers in the family burying-ground, and but' for the&#xD;
laughing and crowing of the little one, the place would&#xD;
have been dreary beyond endurance. Under "iMlammy's"&#xD;
cave she grew and improved each day, and was, as Tup-&#xD;
per says, "a well-spring of joy in the house." As sole&#xD;
inheritor of her grandfather's vast property, rumor soon&#xD;
named her "a great heiress;" and fathers who had an&#xD;
eye to business, and mainmas who were indifferent, you&#xD;
know, to such trifles as money and estates, commenced&#xD;
early to lay plans as to how such a prize could be cap-&#xD;
tured by "my dear Charles Augustus."&#xD;
in consequence of his broken health, and the necessity&#xD;
of looking after his daughter's property, Clifford dissolved&#xD;
partnership with his uncle, Judge Baker, and resided per-&#xD;
manently at "Mossy Greek."&#xD;
And now, it was the anniversary of poor Virginia's&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
death Going into her room, which he had never oc~&#xD;
copied, Clifford locked the door, and taking from the&#xD;
writing-desk the letter which contained her dying re-&#xD;
quest, sat down, and with trembling fingers broke the&#xD;
seal. Then, with eyes filled with 4ionder, hp read the&#xD;
words which I~is little, dead wife had penned. There&#xD;
were only a few lines, but they filled his heart with a&#xD;
strange feeling as he read them time and agaim. 4hen&#xD;
he pressed his hand to his eyes, and looked to see if he was&#xD;
not mistaken; then he turned the sheet over~~the 16~ked&#xD;
around the room-he looked at himself-everything was&#xD;
right, and he examined the letter again. It certainly&#xD;
was Virginia's handwriting, but ~was it possible that any'&#xD;
woman ever lived who could write what was in that let-&#xD;
ter?&#xD;
Yes, he knew that his little wife was capable of doing&#xD;
it. He knew that she had lived-he knew she was&#xD;
dead out yonder under the long moss, and brushing away&#xD;
a tear, lie folded the sacred letter and kissing it, mur~&#xD;
inured:&#xD;
"My poor Virginia! you were indeed: an angeL"&#xD;

A month later, a4~hin, pale man presented himself at&#xD;
the door of the American Ambassador's residence in.&#xD;
London. His step was unsteady-his heart fluttered ner~&#xD;
vously-aud there wa~ an undefinable expression in his&#xD;
eyes, as of a secret not revealed.&#xD;
While standing in this state of bewilderment and agi.&#xD;
station, the dooi' opened, and a footman awaited his&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
Forgetting for the instant that he was not in the&#xD;
"Sunny South," where the familiarityy existing between&#xD;

servants and owners would have made it not only a le-&#xD;
gitirnate but a natural question, he said, to the astonish-&#xD;
ineiit; of tl~~ Briton:&#xD;
"Is Miss Gertrude in?"&#xD;
"You mean Miss Lawrence that was, sir?" asked the&#xD;
attendant with something like a sneer.&#xD;
Only catching the name of "Miss Lawrence," and not&#xD;
the two words "that was," the stranger said impatiently:&#xD;
"The sarnc; is she in ~" and his determined tone and&#xD;
look made ~John cower as he answered quickly:&#xD;
She is, sir."&#xD;
" Tell her an old friend wishes to see her; " and with-&#xD;
out awaiting an invitation from the usher, whom he&#xD;
fancied did irot wish to admit him, the pale gentleman&#xD;
walked in, when John instantly threw open the door of&#xD;
the reception-room, and said:&#xD;
"Walk in, sir"&#xD;
Agitated almost beyond control, and trembling with&#xD;
excitement, he' sank down and panted for breath. The&#xD;
few minutes which passed thus seemed like ages; then&#xD;
footsteps were heard corning hastily down the stairway.&#xD;
lie wanted to see her, but he was filled with fears and&#xD;
doubts. Wherefore? Nothing could have happened!&#xD;
Of course not! What could? It had only been a year&#xD;
and a half since he had seen her; of course nothing could&#xD;
have occurred in so short a time as that; oh no, nothing!&#xD;
Then his heart gave a little doubtful throb to such over-&#xD;
confidence as this. But she said she would never marry,&#xD;
and of course she would keep her word; and thus the&#xD;
stranger consoled, doubted, believed, and tortured himself ~&#xD;
alternately.&#xD;
In the midst of these thoughts, Gertrude entered the&#xD;
&#xD;
READ!!!&#xD;
room, and stood gazing earnestly, but without recognk&#xD;
tion, at the pale man who had called himself "an old&#xD;
4riend." A look of disappointment and pain came over&#xD;
his face, and sighing, he said, with a faltering voice:&#xD;
*" IPo you not know me&#xD;
"Clifford ! !" and the tone was not unlike that tone of&#xD;
agony with which she pronounced the same name that&#xD;
night at The Terraces. Then springing forward, she&#xD;
clasped both hands tightly over his one, for his left arm&#xD;
was still in a sling.&#xD;
And again he #as disappointed, for he had expected a&#xD;
warmer greeting. And the next second his heart ex-&#xD;
cused her for of course she did not know but that he was&#xD;
still a husband. Yes, that is the reason, he thought;&#xD;
and again he consoled himself as best he could. Of&#xD;
course h~ knew no changes had come to any one but&#xD;
himself. How could they?&#xD;
"Iii would never have--~----;" but she checked herself&#xD;
before the sentence was completed.&#xD;
Understanding what she meant to say, he sighed and&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"No, I am sadly changed;" and sitting down upon&#xD;
a sofa side by side, they fell into a constrained silence ;&#xD;
for Clifford's heart was too. full for utterance, and Ger~&#xD;
trude was trying to force back the tears which dimmed&#xD;
her sight and rendered her speechless.&#xD;
For more than a year past, neither one knew a single&#xD;
incident in the life, of the other, for it must be remem-&#xD;
bered that twenty years ago there were no cables, and&#xD;
communication with the Old World was a thing of&#xD;
months instead of days. Thisiong and silent separation, it&#xD;
~would seem, ought to have furnished an inexhaustible&#xD;

&#xD;
theme for conversation between two old friends; but the&#xD;
truth is, neither one had the courage to open the closed&#xD;
boQk of the past-Gertrude from fear of giving pain&#xD;
-Clifford from fear of seeing his last hope vanish.&#xD;
So~near, and yet-so far! Could strangers know less&#xD;
~of each other? They were like two persons standing&#xD;
before a clairvoyant wishing to' have the future revealed&#xD;
to them, yet shrinking from the disclosure.&#xD;
A hollow cough broke upon the stillness, and stealing&#xD;
a. second glance at the pale, haggard face and sunken eyes&#xD;
of her unexpected visitor, Gertrude's heart gave a throb&#xD;
of pain, for she knew only too well that he was a victim&#xD;
of that fatal disease which was handed down as a heredi-&#xD;
tary curse in his father's family. She must be forgiven&#xD;
for her long and embarrassing silence, for the changed&#xD;
and sudden. appearance of her friend overwhelmed her&#xD;
so that she could not recover her self-control at once.&#xD;
When last she saw him, he was in the flush of youth&#xD;
and triumph, and in the possession of robust health.&#xD;
Now, he was but a wreck of his former~, self, and so&#xD;
altered by disease and suffering, that had she met him&#xD;
without hearing him speak, she would not have known&#xD;
him.&#xD;
A natural delicacy of feeling made her shrink from&#xD;
referring to the ~change in his appearance, and as they&#xD;
'had no topics of conversation in general, a silence which&#xD;
they could not control held them both in its unpleasant&#xD;
bondage. At length Gertrude recovered sufficiently to&#xD;
say:&#xD;
"When did you arrive?"&#xD;
"Last night."&#xD;
"How are they all at home?"&#xD;
&#xD;

on't ask me," he said, with an impatient Wave of the&#xD;
hand, as th~~igh the subject was a disagreeable one.&#xD;
Then bending upon her a searching look, he said ~&#xD;
"You know nothing of the changes which have taken&#xD;
place? You have heard nothing?"&#xD;
"Nothing!" she answered, while something like a shnd~&#xD;
der passed Over her.&#xD;
"Then read this;" and taking from his pocket a letter,&#xD;
he handed it to her, and watched her face while she read&#xD;
the following:&#xD;
"My Di~u CI~nrroi~, :-.Because I have remained silent, do not&#xD;
imagine that I am ignorant of the trials and sacrifices which you&#xD;
have been called upon to endure and make. That I have not chided&#xD;

my sympathy and not-my censure. That you did not love ma&#xD;

the. tears filled her eyes, and when she finished, her hands&#xD;
dropped in her lap1 and the letter fell upon the floor.&#xD;
It was a trying hour to both, for the suspense was agony&#xD;
to Glifford, and Gertrude felt that it waS not Qrtly a trial&#xD;
of he~ feelings, but a test of her honor. It will be re-&#xD;
inembered that only ~i short time before she said to her&#xD;
husband, "I can never love as I have loved."&#xD;
But that old lo~c was buried, and to resurrect it now&#xD;
would be dishonor. Had it already come back, in those&#xD;
few moment~ of painful silence, to make her faithless to&#xD;
her marriage-VOWS, and to blast her future with its insidi-&#xD;
ous temptations? Why did she hesitate? IDo we forget&#xD;
that she is but human-do we forget that she once loved&#xD;
this man better than her own soul? The shock was ter-&#xD;
rible; for an instant the old life glided before her-for an&#xD;
instant the old love fluttered in her heart-for a moment&#xD;
that little word "if?' made a thousand delightful but&#xD;
wicked suggestions; but it was only for a moment, for&#xD;
honor and duty crushed the disloyal feelings in her breast,&#xD;
and recovering slowly from the sudden shock, she said,&#xD;
~ith trembling voice:&#xD;
"Did you not know--'?"&#xD;
"What?" he said, clutching hey wrist so tightly as to&#xD;
make it painful, while he searched her face with the&#xD;
breathless anxiety with which a man watches the lips of&#xD;
the Judge whose sentence is to give him life or death.&#xD;
"What?" he asked again, as she still hesitated to&#xD;
speak the words which her woman'S instinct told her&#xD;
would seal his doom.&#xD;
"That IL was-1" and again the sentence was not f1n~&#xD;

"Was what ~" he again said, almost gasping fr breath,&#xD;
and trembling in every limb.&#xD;
"Married!" she ~at leno~th s&#xD;
ran throiio'h I~er, as lie ~ aid; and a thrill of horror&#xD;
released his grip upon her arm,&#xD;
turned deadly pale, groaned, and sank back in his seat, for&#xD;
she thought she had killed him.&#xD;
It was a momentary swoon; then a shudder, a gasp for&#xD;
breath; and as if to hide his agony, he covered his face&#xD;
with his hand, and rested his head in the corner of the&#xD;
sofa where he sat.&#xD;
Then there was a long silence between them, for Ger-&#xD;
trude was not more loyal than Clifford was honorable;&#xD;
and neither trusted themselves to speak, lest one un-&#xD;
guarded word should mar the fealty which they both&#xD;
owed to another. During this painful silence, a shoi*&#xD;
retrospect of his life, with all its beautiful promises, its.&#xD;
temptations, its trials, its disappointments passed before&#xD;
Clifford; and now, having seen his last hope vanish like&#xD;
the rest, he sat, crushed and blighted, like some plant&#xD;
over which the fatal sirocco had swept. Then he won-&#xD;
dered to himself if he was the same man who had started&#xD;
life, scarce four years before, with such brilliant pros-&#xD;
pects; and then his heart hardened towards God, for it&#xD;
is not uncommon for men to expect everything from&#xD;
their Maker, but to give nothing in return. Meanwhile,&#xD;
Gertrude sat struggling with her heart; tra.mj4ing down&#xD;
the old love, putting back the old life, ~and asking God&#xD;
to give her strength to do her whole duty in the trying&#xD;
hour then upon her.&#xD;
Clifford knew he must go, and yet-he could ~not move;&#xD;
he knew he must say "good.by," but he could not speak;&#xD;
and the two~ sat silent and miserable. The sun-dial could&#xD;

not have marked those moments, for by its record they&#xD;
would scarcely have numbered half an hour ; but by&#xD;
heart-throbs they were a lifetime-by suffering-an eter-&#xD;

After so long a time, with the life gone out of his&#xD;
heart, the light out of his eyes, and the stamp of despair,&#xD;
if not death, upon his brow, Clifford arose, and tottering&#xD;
as he attempted to stand, extended his hand to Gertrude,&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
" Then-I must go."&#xD;
Taking his hand, she forced back her tears, and stand-&#xD;
ing by his side, looked in his eyes and said, with an agi-&#xD;
tated voice,:&#xD;
"Clifford, this life is not all. It has been full of disap-&#xD;
poitments for us both. Let us try, though, and see the&#xD;
hand of God in every trial; and bowing meekly to His&#xD;
will, so live hereafter as to meet Virginia in heaven."&#xD;

"Who is "Birdie"?&#xD;
"IMy little Gertrude."&#xD;
" Yes," between the blinding tears which were falling.&#xD;
" God bless you! farewell forever!" and kissing her&#xD;
brow, he went slowly out into the world, old with grief,&#xD;
and heart-broken with disappointment. The crowd jostled&#xD;
him on the streets, but he did not notice it; the sun&#xD;
shone, but he knew not whether it was day or night ; the&#xD;
ragged paupers followed after him and begged alms at&#xD;
his hands, but their pitiful petitions did not reach his&#xD;
ear's; and thus he wandered on in a state of abstract&#xD;
misery, which knew nothing, saw nothing, heard nothing,&#xD;
until exhaustion drove him to a seat in a park.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIX.&#xD;
BREAKING DOWN TILE WALL.&#xD;
OR some weeks after the events recorded in the&#xD;
last chapter, there was a restraint upon Paul and&#xD;
Gertrude which was* fast growing into an un-&#xD;
pleasant coolness~ The cause of this will be readily&#xD;
appreciated by those who comprehend that there should&#xD;
be no secrets between man and wife. There must be&#xD;
perfect confidence, or there cannot, there will not be,&#xD;
perfect love; for the moment one conceals something from&#xD;
the other, that moment a barrier rises up between them,&#xD;
which first begets coolness-then estrangement-then in-&#xD;
difference-and where it is to end-God only knows.&#xD;
On the day of CliffOrd's visit, Gertrude was natura1~y&#xD;
and as we have seen, terribly agitated, both during his&#xD;
stay and after he had gone; and none but women, who&#xD;
have so much to conceal,~ and so much to bear in silence,&#xD;
can appreciate what an effort it 'was for her to bathe her&#xD;
eyes, to banish old memories, and to wear a smile t]~tat&#xD;
was forced, to meet the loved ones upon their return&#xD;
home. This need not have been the case, but she made&#xD;
the fatal mistake that wrecks the happir~ss of so many&#xD;
women; and instead of going to her husband and telling&#xD;

* him a~1, she locked her secret in her own breast, and&#xD;
fin~d1y aroused his suspicions by what she withheld. In&#xD;
this, site was more to be pitied than blamed, and her igno-&#xD;
rance / must excuse her for - not doing what she perhaps&#xD;
lacked the courage to execute, even granting she had&#xD;
known what course was best to pursue. At dinner, the&#xD;
day of the visit, she was so much affected that her food&#xD;
was untasted, and both husband and uncle observed that&#xD;
she had been weeping. There was a cold and constrained&#xD;
conversation maintained, very unlike the merry chats&#xD;
they usually engaged in around the board; and after re-&#xD;
peated attempts, Gertrude said, with the best effort at&#xD;
self-control she could command:&#xD;
"I had a visit from an old friend this morning."&#xD;
was it?" asked both gentlemen at the same&#xD;
time.&#xD;
Guess.~~&#xD;
"Count ID'Auvergne?"&#xD;
"That pcor Count, uncle, seems to be foreVer in your&#xD;
thoughts, and I really believe that you are afraid of him&#xD;
now, ev9n though I am married."&#xD;
"Was\itnotke?"&#xD;
"I giv~ it up, then."&#xD;
"And you, Paul; whom do you say? ~&#xD;
"I nev~r was good at guessing, Gertrude. Do tell us;&#xD;
don't keep us in suspense."&#xD;
"The last person you would dream of" she answered,&#xD;
getting a ~Iittle bolder; "and so changed, I should never&#xD;
have knoWn him, if I had not heard him speak."&#xD;
A suspicion instantly flashed across Paul's mind, and&#xD;

&#xD;
laying down his knife and fork, he looked straight at his&#xD;
wife tvnd said:&#xD;
"Was it Clifford Troup?"&#xD;
With burning checks and eyes swimming in tears, she&#xD;
looked down and said, with quivering lips:&#xD;
"It was."&#xD;
"Clifford Troup!" said the uncle, who, looking up j'ust&#xD;
then, caught the peculiar expression upon the faces of&#xD;
niece and nephew, and fearing something unpleasant, he&#xD;
hurried to add: "Why, you amaze me! What is he do-&#xD;
ing in this part of the world, ~nd why did you not keep&#xD;
him to dinner?"&#xD;
"He said he must go," she answered with agitation,&#xD;
for IE~au1 had ne'Q'er taken his eyes from her face, and&#xD;
each moment his suspicions were becoming more deeply&#xD;
rooted.&#xD;
"And you say he is so much altered. What is the&#xD;
matter?&#xD;
"Consumption, I judge, from his cough and ap-&#xD;
pearance."&#xD;
"Oh yes, it is hereditary in the family. What a curse!&#xD;
Paul, we must call and see him. Where is he stopping,&#xD;
Gertrude?"&#xD;
"I really-did not-ask him," was the confused reply.&#xD;
"And he left no address?" asked the perplexed uncle.&#xD;
'~None !"&#xD;
"What is he doing here?"&#xD;
"I do not-I did not ask him," was the blundering&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"Where is he going?"&#xD;
"I do not know."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Did he bring no news from home?"&#xD;
"1 do not know that either, except that his wife is&#xD;
dead-and has left a daughter."&#xD;
At these words, both uncle and husband looked at the&#xD;
speaker; who sat trying to balance a teaspoon upon the&#xD;
edge of a cup, and although neither ever mentioned it to*&#xD;
the other, in their hearts, at that moment, each one fan-&#xD;
eie4 he found the cause of hei~ tears and agitation. The&#xD;
conversation was calculated to leave the uninitiated in&#xD;
some mystery, and it was not strange that Paul gliould&#xD;
feel anxious, if not unhappy, to be left in doubt as to the&#xD;
object of Clifford's visit, considering the olden intimacy&#xD;
which had existed between himself and Gertrude. Thus.&#xD;
matters stood for some weeks, and as nothing more was&#xD;
disclosed, the wall grew formidable every day between&#xD;
husband and wife.&#xD;
What to do Gertrude did not know, and where the es-&#xD;
trangement was to end, she dared not think.&#xD;
At any other time she would have gone to her uncle,&#xD;
but somehow or other, this particular affair seemed a&#xD;
matter of so much delicacy, that she shrank from even&#xD;
speaking to him of it. Was that'~the real reason, or did&#xD;
she fear that he would discover something which she&#xD;
wished to, conceal? God forbid that any such thoughts&#xD;
should be harbored in her breast; but then we must not&#xD;
forget that she was only human, and a woman with per-&#xD;
haps far more feeling than philosophy.&#xD;
Thus matters stood, until one evening Paul lighted a&#xD;
cigar and walked out, and Mr. Hall and Gertrude were&#xD;
left alone. This habit of going out in the. evening was&#xD;
growing upon Paul; and it was remarkable, of late, that&#xD;

lie never gave his wife the parting kiss, which a few&#xD;
weeks before was bestowed so lovingly and so frequently.&#xD;
All these things, which Mr. Hall silently observed,&#xD;
rendered him very unhappy, -and he determined to&#xD;
speak to Gertrude on the subject the first opportunity&#xD;
that presented itself. Such an occasion was difficult to&#xD;
find, even though.they lived under the same roof; for the&#xD;
front door would scarcely close upon Paul before she&#xD;
wotild steal a hurried kiss, and hasteP, in a frightened&#xD;
~nanuer, to her own chamber, there to pass the night in&#xD;
weeping, and in asking herself ivhat was to be done.&#xD;
The breach grew wider day by day. The husband&#xD;
became more silent and abstracted, and the wife was&#xD;
wretched beyond description. But how could the wall be&#xD;
broken down?&#xD;
Alas! that "how" is the rock upon which the bark of&#xD;
so many young married people splits.&#xD;
One says: "I'm misunderstood; "the other says: "She&#xD;
is not the same to me." Then the little nothings which&#xD;
make us happy are neglected, and what was, at first, a&#xD;
misunderstanding, grows rapidly into coldness, then into&#xD;
indifference, then iflto estrangement, and if it be not&#xD;
checked, into positive dislike. The morning and evening&#xD;
kiss is not exchanged, the pleasant little courtesies of life&#xD;
are ignored, the drives or walks, if taken at all now, are&#xD;
taken separately, the. confidential talks dwindle down to&#xD;
cold monosyllables, the w4fe retires to weep, while the&#xD;
husband perchance walks the streets in.wretchedness, or&#xD;
seeks amusement in some resort of doubtful propriety; and&#xD;
then the devil rejoices, for he has entered a happy home,&#xD;
and~ by encouraging a pride which is false in theory and&#xD;
&#xD;
falser in practice, has laid the foundation of what will&#xD;
become, in time, an insurmountable wall, unless it be&#xD;
speedily broken down.&#xD;
Oh, wives and husbands, struggle with all the earnest-&#xD;
ness of your souls against the first misunderstanding, for,&#xD;
believe us, subsequent ones will come oftener and~easier,&#xD;
and it is the first one that you must keep from your fire~&#xD;
side.&#xD;
L~et there be no concealment, no secrets which are not&#xD;
mutually shared; be all in all to each other; be the world&#xD;
to qne another, and do not be satisfied with anything less;&#xD;
This being done there is nothing to fear; this being net-&#xD;
lected there is everything to fear. .~As we see, there was&#xD;
no real cause for the unhappiness and estrangement which&#xD;
existed between the young husband and wife; and could&#xD;
we take a peep behind the domestic curtain, we would&#xD;
frequently di&amp;amp;~over the most abject misery springing from&#xD;
sources even lighter than the one here detailed; for at&#xD;
last it all amounted to this, that she failed to tell him&#xD;
what would have made no difference if known, but whar&#xD;
gained in importance by being withheld.&#xD;
We began by saying Paul had gone out, and as usual*&#xD;
a few moments afterwards Gertrude was giving her uncle&#xD;
the hasty kiss before retiring, when he put both arms&#xD;
around her, and drawing her to his knee in the old-fash-&#xD;
ioned way, said:&#xD;
"Gertrude, what is the matter?"&#xD;
Leaning her head upon his should she burst into&#xD;
tears; and that was her only reply.&#xD;
"Foolish children that you are. Why will you make&#xD;
yourselves so miserable, when you might be so happy?&#xD;
Tell mc all before it is too late."&#xD;

Still nothing but tears.&#xD;
"That visit has something to do with it. Tell me&#xD;

Still no answer, but sobs; and stroking back her beau-&#xD;

"Gertrude, will you tell me?"&#xD;
2l3rushiilg back her tears, she arose, and Baying:&#xD;
"In a moment," left the room. turningg quickly,&#xD;
&amp;amp;he handed him the letter which Clifford had given her&#xD;
to read, and sitting down upon a stool at his feet, buried&#xD;
her face in her hands, and bowed her head upon his&#xD;
knee. With surprise and deep concern, he read it care-&#xD;
fully to the end, then raising her head so that he could&#xD;
look into her eyes, he said:&#xD;
"Did he know you were married, when he gave you&#xD;
this to read?"&#xD;
"No 1"&#xD;
"Did he come to offer himself to you?"&#xD;
"I suppose so, for he seemed deeply affected when I&#xD;
told-him II was married."&#xD;
"Then, what did he say?"&#xD;
"lie ~aid he must go."&#xD;
"Nothing else?"&#xD;
"lie asked me if I would take care of his little 'Birdie'&#xD;

"Nothing else?"&#xD;
"lie then-kissed me-and went away."&#xD;

Hall sat leaning on his band, looking thoughtfully across'&#xD;
the room. Gertrude's heart beat anxiously as she watched&#xD;
him, and she absoltLtely trembled when he looked earnestly&#xD;
at h~r and said:&#xD;
"Do you regret being married to Paul Maxwell?"&#xD;
"No," she answered quickly.&#xD;
"Has the old love for Clifford Troup returned?"&#xD;
"No-not as I once loved him; for since the hour that&#xD;
you showed me the sin of it, in your little 'sanctuary,' I&#xD;
have struggled against it; and of course, if I had not&#xD;
conquered that love, I should never have married 'PauL&#xD;
But, uncle, to see him so altered and so heart-broken,&#xD;
affected me deeply; and somehow I could not talk about&#xD;
it either to you or to Paul-for I feared Paul might&#xD;
misunderstand it."&#xD;
"That, my child, is the mistake you made. Go now&#xD;
to your husband, tell him all, do ffot keep back a single&#xD;
thing; tell him you married him because you loved him;&#xD;
tell him that you love him still, and all will be well again.&#xD;
D~ not sleep this night until you are reconciled to each&#xD;
other. Go now and await his return&#xD;
ward your efforts."             , and may God re-&#xD;

chamber with a lighter heart than she had known for&#xD;
many weeks.&#xD;

The night was far advanced, and still Gertrude sat try-&#xD;

Growing restless and nervous, sh~ finally laid the&#xD;
book down, and going to the window, opened it and&#xD;
leant out in the night air.~&#xD;
It was a lovely night in July, and through the hazy&#xD;

&#xD;
atmosphere the lamp-lights gleamed like ~lll-~'-th~-Wi5p8&#xD;
in a swamp. Looking down upon the head~ of the&#xD;
crowd, the young wife said to herself: "What detains&#xD;
him? He never stayed out so late before;" and then a&#xD;
shudder passed over her as she thought: "What if he&#xD;
never returns!"&#xD;
Ah! how many young wives have asked themselves the&#xD;
same agonizing question, when the midnight hour found&#xD;
them watching for the return of the loved one, whom&#xD;
a Blight misunderstanding and too rnuch pride had&#xD;
driven into the streets or some worse place to hide his&#xD;
grief. So intent was Gertrude in looking down upon the&#xD;
vast crowd as it went surging beneath her window, that&#xD;
she did not hear her husband's noiseless entrance, nor was&#xD;
she aware of his presence in the room until a deep sigh&#xD;
attracted her attention.&#xD;
"Paul," she said in a startled tone; but he simply looked&#xD;
coldly at her, then turned away:&#xD;
Her heart almost misgave her at this harsh treatment;&#xD;
but like the brave woman she was, she determined to do&#xD;
her duty, and leave the result to God.&#xD;
Taking then, poor Virginia's letter from her pocket,&#xD;
she stood before her husband, who did not even look at&#xD;
her, and said:&#xD;
Paul, IL have, done wrong; I have concealed some-&#xD;
thing from you. Read this, and then I will tell you the&#xD;
rest."&#xD;
Taking the letter, his hand trembled so that he could&#xD;
scarcely read, and watching him, Gertrude feared she&#xD;
had little to hope, judging by the expression of constem&#xD;
nation and anger upon his face. At length he finished&#xD;

reading it though, an~l with a gasp crumpled it in hi~&#xD;
hand. Then, quick as thought, a strange, wild light&#xD;
gleamed from his eyes, and springing up, he said:&#xD;
"Did the Scolilidrel give you this letter, knowing you&#xD;
were married ~"&#xD;
"Oh, no, no, Paul-no," answered the wife, with fear&#xD;
and trembling.&#xD;
"I suppose you told him you regretted you were mar-&#xD;
ried to another?"&#xD;
"Oh, Paul, how can you do me such injustice?" and&#xD;
bursting into tears, she sank down in despair, while her,&#xD;
husband walked back and forth the room like a madman,&#xD;
for iu that moment he believed all happiness was over for&#xD;
them both. As soon as she could control herself, Ger-&#xD;
trud~ got up, and joining her husband, slipped her hand&#xD;
in his arm, and said:&#xD;
"Paul, I married you because I loved you, and-"&#xD;
"And do you love me now?" lie said quickly, as if his&#xD;
very life depended upon her answer.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And no one else?"&#xD;
"And no one else."&#xD;
The next instant she was folded to his heart in an&#xD;
eager embrace, such as we give a loved one from wham&#xD;
we have been separated. Then kissing her, he said:&#xD;
"Will you forgive me, darling?"&#xD;
"Rather should. I say, will you forgive me?" pleaded&#xD;
the wife between smiles and tears.&#xD;
"With all my heart," was the eager response, as lie&#xD;
again pressed her to his heart.&#xD;
"And henceforth we w41;have no more concealments;"&#xD;

and her words were sealed with a kiss. The rest of the in-&#xD;
cidents were told as she sat upon his knee, with his arms&#xD;
folded lovingly around her, and together they wept over&#xD;
the sad fate of Clifford Troup, together they talked of                         CIIAPTER L.&#xD;

THE SHADOWS TIEJIOWEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
in the Sunny South, his poor heart-broken mother knelt,&#xD;
and interceding with the good God, prayed that her tern-&#xD;
pest-tossed boy might find rest in his mansions at last-&#xD;
rest and peace after the storms of this life were ended.&#xD;
Storms for which he was scarcely responsible, but through&#xD;
which he must pass in order to fulfil the law; for has not - -&#xD;
Jehovah said that "the- iniquities of the fathers shall be&#xD;
visited upon the children to the third and fourth genera-&#xD;
But who remembers this, or what man stops to consider&#xD;
that his own flesh and blood must suffer for his evil do-&#xD;
ings?&#xD;
"Jake," his colored valet, and "IMiamtfly" and "Bir-&#xD;
die," were with him; but to none of these could Clifford&#xD;
show the drops of blood, as they oozed slowly but surely&#xD;
out of his heart. To none' of them could he show the&#xD;
crown of thorns which pierced his weary, aching brow;&#xD;
and ~o what little of love and what little of life he had&#xD;
left to give were lavished upon "Birdie." She was his&#xD;
all now; and to her his heart gave all its tenderness and&#xD;
all its devotion, until he- feared he was making her an&#xD;
idol.&#xD;
Singularly enough, she returned this love with an ardor&#xD;
that was rare in a child, and oftentimes, when IMIamnly&#xD;
would start with her for a walk or drive, her blue eyes&#xD;
would fill with tears at parting from her father, and she&#xD;
would cry so, that he would have her brought back, say-&#xD;
in~&#xD;
"There will be plentY of time, Maminy, when II am&#xD;
gone. Let me have her while III am here."&#xD;
"Certainly,' Mars Clifford, certainly," INliamnay would&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SHADOWS THICKER.&#xD;
&#xD;
say, and putting his little pet on the bed beside him,&#xD;
would turn away to hide her falling tears.&#xD;
Thus the wi ter dragged wearily and painfully away,&#xD;
and the trying winds of March taxed all Clifford's&#xD;
strength ~nd the skill of his physician to keep life in&#xD;
him. Blankets were stretched across the windows, fires&#xD;
were kept steadily burning, and by a thermometer th&amp;amp;&#xD;
rooms were kept at summer heat. But all this made no&#xD;
difference, a~d Clifford, knowing that the end was near,&#xD;
gave final directions to his faithful and devoted attend-&#xD;
ants. . T6 Jake he gave two letters, saying:&#xD;
"When I am dead, Jake, I wish you to take me back&#xD;
to ~Ameri~ato be buried in the old family burying-ground&#xD;
at the 'Manor.' IJpoll your arrival at M-, you wilL&#xD;
give this letter to my mother. You must go by London,&#xD;
and leave Mammy and 'Birdie~' with-Mrs. Maxwell,&#xD;
whom you will find at Mr. Hall's, the American Ambas-&#xD;
sador's, and to whom you will give this letter. Main-&#xD;
my, you and 'Birdie' will live with Mrs. Maxwell, and&#xD;
I want you to promise me never to leave my little darling&#xD;
while you live. Do you promise?"&#xD;
"Yes, Mars Clifford; and may de Lord strike me&#xD;
dead if ever I forfeits my word 1" and the old soul wept&#xD;
as if her heart would break.&#xD;
"And you both promise to do exactly as IL have told&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"Most surelyl, sir," answered Jake, with rather an&#xD;
off ended aj~r at -being asked such an unnecessary ques-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Then II can die satisfied;" and closing his eyes, he&#xD;
turned over and laid in a kind of stupor all day, but in&#xD;

~S6~           THE SHADOWS ThICKEN.&#xD;
reality he was engaged in silent prayer, and was trying&#xD;
to keep the promise made to both Virginia and Ger-&#xD;
trude.&#xD;
During the night he rallied a little, and in the morn-&#xD;
ing, ~whule " Jake" and "Mammy" had stepped out of&#xD;
the room for a moment, he breathed his last with "l3ir-&#xD;
die" clasped in his arms.&#xD;
A smile lingered round his lips, and when "iNtamthy"&#xD;
returned, she thought he was only teasing "Birdie" by&#xD;
pretending to be asleep, as this little elf slapped him in&#xD;
the face, pulled his hair, and called him "Fader, Fader."&#xD;
Soon, however, the truth flashed upon "Mammy," and&#xD;
snatching the child from the arms of her dead father, she&#xD;
flew for the doctor. He came hurriedly, but his skill was&#xD;
of no avail, for. his patient was beyond the reach of&#xD;
human power; and let us hope he found peace and rest&#xD;
at last!&#xD;
Thus, while the son expiated by suffering and death&#xD;
the iniquities of his father, that poor father was cursed&#xD;
with the treble boon of life, poverty, and dissipation;&#xD;
and already the large sum which Clifford had set aside&#xD;
for him when he went abroad had been swallowed up in&#xD;
the most sickening debauches.&#xD;
And as the crushed, blighted, and heart-broken mother&#xD;
listened to the impious ravings of her~ husband, she shud-&#xD;
dered lest the anger of God should descend upon their&#xD;
heads and consume them body and soul. But had he&#xD;
not set up other gods? had he not fallen down and wor-&#xD;
shipped other idols?&#xD;
Iliad he not taught his son that noblesse oblige was syn-&#xD;
onymous with "honor thy father and mother, that thy&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God&#xD;
giveth thee?"&#xD;
Is there such a thing as retributive justice?&#xD;
Let him who doubts it look into the hearts of his&#xD;
fellow-men, and see if happiness is the result of iniqui-&#xD;
tous dealings.&#xD;
Let him look at the life of this man, which was now&#xD;
but a living hell; and yet there was no absolute crime in&#xD;
it. No; it was but the result of human frailty leaning&#xD;
upon its own slight arm for support-..--the inevitable con-&#xD;
sequence of moral weakness, which craved a white sep-&#xD;
ulchre for men to gaze at, while the all-seeing Eye alone&#xD;
saw the worms enfolded within. Thus Life pursued this.&#xD;
frail man with a relentless remorse that made him cower&#xD;
before its accusations, and made him plead for Death as&#xD;
though there would be relief beyond the tomb. Only&#xD;
think! he cared not for eternal damnation, because then&#xD;
he would be free from the sneers of his fellow-men.&#xD;

well, whom "Mammy" now took charge of, Wii~ not her&#xD;
own brother.&#xD;
Nothing pleased her ~o much as to stand by hi8 crib&#xD;
and rock him, "by-a-baby;" and, when they went out&#xD;
walking, she was proud as any queen if allowed to push&#xD;
the carriage ever so short a distance.&#xD;
The resemblance to her father was so .striking, that at&#xD;
times Gertrude would be startled, and the tears would&#xD;
spring to her eyes as she watched her at play.&#xD;
But they came not from disloyalty to her husband,&#xD;
whom she loved with an increasing love each day, but&#xD;
from regret at the sad fate of the young, parents, who&#xD;
were the victims of pride and selfishness. That they&#xD;
died of broken hearts she did not doubt; and that such&#xD;
a disease prevails, we, who dive down deep into human&#xD;
breasts, and there see tliQ inner workings, with society&#xD;
masks left off, do believe.&#xD;
Then let us be gentle o~e with another, both bearing&#xD;
and forbearing; for we do not know how often our&#xD;
brothers are ready to sink by the wayside with the heavy&#xD;
burden of life, and only think how one little kind word&#xD;
will cheer that drooping, fainting form.&#xD;
And, in conclusion, we desire to repeat to our young&#xD;
men what the Deiphic Oracle said to Cicero% when he&#xD;
inquired by what means he might rise to the greatest&#xD;
glory.&#xD;
The priestess bade him "follow nature, and not take&#xD;
the opinion of the multitude for the guide of his life."&#xD;

which have been given ~huin-~--whoever defies God and his&#xD;

CHAPTER II&#xD;
be possible for me to do my duty, with this&#xD;
reminder ever before me ~" asked Gertrude of&#xD;
herself, as she sat rocking "Birdie" to sleep one&#xD;
evening~; for the wee traveller and "Mammy '1' were now&#xD;
regularly installed as inmates of Mr. Hall's household;&#xD;
and, strange to say, the little double orphan just walked&#xD;
right into the hearts of the entire family, never having&#xD;
been shy or afraid of them for even a moment.&#xD;
From some fancied resemblance, oi' some other cause-&#xD;
for who knows what is in the minds of children-&#xD;
"Birdie" called ]?aul "fader" from the very beginning,&#xD;
and would cry for him so when he left the hoi~se, that he&#xD;
frequently took h~r with him. This pleased him won-&#xD;
derfully; and Gertrude, fancying she saw the hand of&#xD;
Providence in it all, said to herself, "The little darling&#xD;
must have been sent to test my strength, and .1 will pray&#xD;
to God to help me do my duty."&#xD;
And so the days went by, and Mr. Hall was now the&#xD;
proudest "grandpa" in all England, for so he insisted&#xD;
upon calling himself; and it was many, many years&#xD;
before "Birdie" knew that the little Reuben Hall Max-&#xD;
