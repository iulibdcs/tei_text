THE tragical incident which closes the following life-history was familiar to me a great while be- fore I had an opportunity to connect it logically with any of the antecedent facts, notwithstanding that the interest and curiosity aroused by its recital kept me ever on the watch for information. After several years had elapsed, during which I had gathered up many of the circumstances, but not in such form, order, or relation as to suffice for a plausible theory, I was rewarded while present at the demolition of the family mansion, mentioned in these pages, by obtain- ing possession of the manuscript about to be intro- duced to the reader. It was found in the vault at the foot of the secret stairway which was so ingeni- ously used to the injury of the fair autobiographist. This manuscript, though at first written evidently with a view to publication, was thrown iinto the vault, in all probability, on the occurrence of an event which, as the reader will understand when he reaches it, rendered its publicity -undesirable. Whether it    <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6869-00000003"/> 4        HNTRODUCTO R Y. was intended to be placed beyond recovery is ques- tionable. I found a large number of the leaves lying together in proper succession, more of them mixed confusedly, a few torn in pieces, but all the fragments preserved. On the other hand, some few-pages, from several different parts of the manuscript, were not to' be found at all. These losses my antecedent re- searches enabled me to make good; and I have done so in as close an imitation of the language and style of the rest as is possible or desirable. When it would have been so easy utterly to destroy the papers by fire, I am of opinion that the means used to put them out of the way was resorted to because of a lingering thought in the writer's mind of the possible necessity of a future use for them. The character of Manning, undefended by the facts stated, was likely to, and undoubtedly did, suffer in public estimation; and no reader of the story will think its relator loth to leave a record in' favor of a man for whom  her unbounded, inexpressible love would have led her to make any sacrifice whatever, no matter who else of all the worljd might be offended by the declaration of her testimony. Of course Man- nig is not the real -name of the person designated. I knew him personally, and was cognizant of the in- cident at the church, just as it is related, shortly after    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6869-00000004"/> INTRODUCTORY. J took the task; a very perplexing one as it was, so pain- fully had I to identify myself with the occurrences in pursuing them through all their connections. With these few words of explanation, put forward in justice to myself, I lead in my heroine to tell her own story,- -or, to speak less figuratively, I lay her manuscript before the reader. G. H.   IN THE RAPIDS. CHAPTER    I. MY grandfather was an. English merchant, who amassed a large fortune during the war of 8'12. He emigrated to America with his family shortly after peace was restored. My father's only recollection of or regard for him seems to have grown out of his mercantile success. The account-books recording his various speculations had crossed the ocean with the family, and were kept as heir-looms; they were closely cherished and frequently pondered over by my father, who inherited the love of money and fondness for affairs, but not the ability, of his predecessor. The  latter, as the founder of the family fortune, got full credit for his remarkable business capacity and suc- cess; all of which came to be matter of tiresome reiteration to me as far back as I can remember. The esteem in which my grandfather was held by 'his family appears, if the reports of his son are to be credited, to have been shared by the community around him; for information of his wide-spread repu- tation for public spirit, enterprise, and patriotism came down with the. account-books, the family plate, and (7)    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6869-00000005"/> 8        ZN THE RAPIDS. other relics and evidences of his fame and fortune. Candor, in respect to both his business habits and his  morals, requires the acknowledgment that a shipment  of arms (as shown by his books) clandestinely made I to the enemy, not reaching its destination until after 9 peace was declared, proved a losing speculation; sug- gesting the reflection how queer a thing patriotism is. My father, under certain states of excitement, would  relate this unfortunate adventure as the one stigma upon the mercantile sagacity of the speculator. It is not with the object of escaping the ascription of inherited faults that I fall into the unfilial one of : asking to be acquitted of having feelings or principles  in common with my father, or into the still more un- filial one of trying to prove it by mentioning my early  and long-retained want of respect for him. What  made him so repulsive to me may be inferred in part from the existence of the same characteristics in the man whom in these pages I shall not always men- tion with a renewed feeling of hate; only because hate is foridden. That such qualities should be found in  father was, the only trouble of my early life. I had eard a simple story of a child that had been changed away by its nurse and restored in course of time. In that story only the father was spoken of as being con- cerned in the loss and recovery. I fell into many a speculation as to the possibility of my having been so  changed, and I dreamed away many an hour imagin- / ing my rightful father's image. In my simplicity, my  almost adorable mother was the subject of the same, cheat as myself; and the kind and tender father to t0   IN THE RAPIDS.        g whom I was to be restored was to be her devoted and loving husband. As time wore on and my views on this subject became more practical and more painful, I failed to learn why so angelic a being as she was had been sacrificed to such a mag. It would have been impossible for her to speak of it without explain-  ing that it was a sacrifice; but she had a peculiar and exalted idea of the sacrament of marriage, which kept her ever silent on the subject. My mother was a tall, delicate woman, with a touch of grace in every movement, and a combination of dignity and beauty in her face, which was always slightly shadowed by a peculiar but unacknowledged ! sadness, inspiring me with respect and veneration in addition to my unbounded love for her. Her sweet, winning voice was precious above all music to my ears. She was almost always my only companion; i  for, with mild but inflexible firmness, she had carried the point, frequently contested with my father, of ex- elusive control over my education. She was descended from a rich and haughty family of the French West V Indies. All that wealth, travel, books, and the attri- tion of refined society could add, of polish and culture, to inherited gentility, was hers. This much I learned while she was imparting her experience of the world as a part of my education. I have not hesitated to re- peat the language adulatory of myself used to me or in my presence. It is simply true that such language was used, and I believe it to have been sincere. I never knew that I was beautiful, nor how much the possession of beauty generally influences a woman's I          i    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6869-00000006"/> 10       IN TZy RAPZDS. fate, until I became wise enough not to have my vanity affected by the'knowledge. So much of myself, so as to introduce what I have to say of her on the same point. In looking casually around upon an assem- blagd of persons, the eye rests naturally, as by some magnetic influence, upon the most beautiful counte- nance. I never saw another woman's face that could detain me for an instant from the contemplation of my mother's. It is no wonder, then, that my own per- sonal appearance held, or holds, so unobtrusive a place in my estimation. That portion of my father's extensive landed posses- sions upon which the residence was erected over- looked bay and river. Starting from the, dwelling, the ground gradually narrowed, fora space, and tfhen again widened, jutting out into the waters, keeping them yet apart for the length of the peninsula thus formed, the extreme point of which was- half a mile or more from the mainland. It sloped abruptly down on both sides, and more gently at its termination to a smooth beach of sand, while a sort of ridge, that traversed nearly its entire length, was covered by a thick screen of trees, intermingled with a tangled, impenetrable under- growth. Just beyond this peninsula, and forming, in fact, a part of it in a low state of the tide, was a little island, upon which had been erected, at my mother's instance, what was familiarly termed "the Lookout." This was a small, octagonal house, with the alternate sides open, and having a peaked roof at first. After- wards, to enlarge the prospect, a platform and railing were fixed ovet the roof, making a sort of balcony, to   which a stairway leading from within was erected. From it a view was had, up and down the bay, more complete than was possible from any portion of the peninsula proper, because the land so projected out at certain points above and below as to interfere with the full sweep of the majestic water-scene except from this point. The south side of the peninsula, looking towards the mouth of the bay, seemed to be my mother's ex- clusive territory,-and the Lookout as well. My father's society was alwiys a restraint upon her, and she was exposed to it everywhere but here. Hither he never came within my memory. Whenever the weather was favorable and her wishes so inclined, she would take me to drive or walk up and down the beach; and, the tide permitting, at sundown we visited the Lookout, and, when conversation flagged, dreamily watched the gradual decline of day. There is nothing,  of all the incidents of my childhood's days which I  recall with so much pleasure (and, I may say also, with so much pain, because they are gone forever) as these promenades. My sweet mother's tender voice ceased not at every step to be heard, instructing and amusing me. Its sound seemed to charge the atmos- phere with some exhilarating element, and her mere presence redoubled and intensified every feeling of which I was capable. I can never sufficiently dwell upon the influence this angelic being exerted over me. And there is no spot whose associations recall it so powerfully as the scene I have described. Perhaps the grand expanse of water spread out before us, the       '      <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6869-00000007"/> 12       IN 7ITE RAPIDS. uninterrupted quiet thWat was around us at all times, and the im' 'essive sense of something eternal con- . veyed by tl. vast reach of the ;vault above us, pre- pared the mild for the admission of the holy influence which emanated at all times from her. How much of what is wrong in my nature resulted from the absence of other children during my own . childhood, to which point I attach nc small impor-  tance,-what virtues, from being preternaturally devel- i oped, became so many vices,-what vices were for- tunately restrained,-it is for the reader of these pages  to determine for himself; but whosoever has the patience to follow me to the end will witness for ' .  me that I have borne honest testimony in favor of my earliest teacher.      a- The narrow screen of woods crowning the ridge before alluded to, as it approache- the mainland branched off on either side, forming a curtain to pro- tect the neighboring dwelling from the cold wind off  the water in winter. 'Through this curtain an ascend- ing pathway led to the walk of the garden surround-  ing the wing of the building in which were my mother's apartments. You could pass into the garden by a gate below, or ascend a stairway to the top of the wall and there enter a gallery leading to her library and bed-chamber. This gallery was her favorite resort in rainy weather for exercise, as well as when the late-  ness of the hour forbade her venturing beyond the precincts of the house. I have been particular in describing its position-,relative to the house and its '; surroundings, and also the means of access to it, t i;4. %     a *     id F   I- AiV J t.,-1J .     I3 because of its connection with the most direful inci- dent of my life. The wing of the building to which it led had been constructed and these arrangements I made for my mother under her supervision, and the I whole formed a 'striking contrast to the rest of the premises. A parlor and conservatory occupied the ground-floor; my mother's and my own bed-cham- ber, and a library-room opening on the gallery, the second story; and over these were the apartments of I my mother's servants. The severest taste was evident in the furniture and arrangements, and one might fancy one's self in the boudoir of a lady of the ancien regime of France on stepping into the cosy library,  which was the room we usually occupied while sewing or engaged in the conversations and readings from ! which I derive most of my education. It was my mother's custom always to greet my father, when meeting him, with the most careful show of respect, and to observe the exactest courtesy towards him during our meals. From my earliest recollection, I remember being struck with the con-- strained nature of this behavior; and, without being able to recall that I was ever so instructed, I fell into ,the same habit of precise and reluctant courtesy towards my father. It was not until after trouble had awakened in him and in me the proper feelings of na- ture that I was conscious of anything like affection for him. My mother was, doubtless, to some extent the cause of this. Whether she is to be blamed for it is another question. Meetings voluntary on my mother's part rarely took place between m? parents, except at 2    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6869-00000008"/> -             # - "       IN THE RAPIDS. meals. But there was an exception to this rule, for a season, at one period. They were closeted daily in her library for a week or more, and I was sent out of the way during these interviews. On meeting my mother after the last one, I was informed by her that I was about to be sent away to school. She explained to me that, although I could learn with her all that I need actually know of mere school' education as far as books might contribute to it, still routine was neces- sary as a preparation for my entry into the "every- day world," to use hAe own phrase, from which it was impossible for me to remain always secluded.   CHAPTER    II. WHLE listening to my mother's recitals of the adventures of the many distiuished people whom she had encountered or with whose history she had otherwise become familiar, I was accustomed to dwell upon their characters and silently to determine to imitate such virtues as they best illustrated In other words, I early began to map out my own future. It would be a tedious task to set down wherein I have fallen short of the ends thus promised and aimed at. But in entering upon this chapter and considering how gravely its incidents affected my whole after-life, I cannot but recur to my early and earnest intentions, the retrospect teaching me-how little any of human kind have to do with their own career. I am about to relate that portion of my history which most affected its general course, and I under- take the task not without some hope of a merciful judgment from such of my sex as have felt the full development of that ,passion which is "a woman's whole existence," or from such of the other sex as have had the good or evil fortune to inspire it. At the age of fifteen I was placed at a boarding- school in the city. I alighted at the door at dusk on a gloomy September evening. My parents accompa-     <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6869-00000009"/> 16       HN THE-, RAPIDS. nied me, and I was handed over without unnecessary ceremony to the care of the dignified and excellent woman who presided over the institution. Supported by the self-control which had been so thoroughly taught me, I restrained the natural grief which filled my heart at parting from my dear mother for the first time, and the few tears I shed at our last embrace were the only perceptible signs of any emotion. My heart sank within me as I heard the bang of the outer door when it closed upon my parents and separated me from  them for a time which then appeared inter- minable. The principal, with whom I was now left alone, inspired me with great respect by her appear- ance and manner, but I felt at once that to me she would always be unapproachable. She took me familiarly by the hand and led me to the Refectory, where the scholars and teachers were assembled for supper. The meal was dispatched in silence. At its close I was put in charge of the pupil who sat at my right, and we were all marshalled' off to the play-room. It was my first experience of so large a number, I may almost say of any number, of children, some of them in age and size other than children, left free to rdmp and laugh and shout at will. Many things combined conspired to render me uncomfortable; and this bois- terous scene, in which the most earnest and pressing solicitations of my appointed companion could not in- duce me to participate, made me simply wretched. My head began to ache, and I felt sick. A few mo- ments more of the uproar and the ceaseless motions, and I should have fainted. But the timely tinkle of a   IX TIX VE RAPIDS.      I7 little bell imposed instant silence upon all, and we were led away to bed. The dormitories occupied a wing of the building which fronted onethe street and overlooked, at its rear and one end, the spacious grounds of the institution. A row of small rooms, or alcoves, as they wer ealled, was on each side of a wide passage traversing the. entire length of-each story. The partition dividing these alcoves from the hall, as well as from each other, did not reach the ceiling. Any noise made or word spoken within these little sanctuaries was easily heard by any one in the-passage. I was assigned a room at the end of this hall. At first, as I afterwards learned, there had been no room here, but the' need of more space had occasioned the erection of a partition across the passage,-the room thus formed taking in the window which overlooked the grounds at the end of the wing, and having the door of each of the two rooms on either side opening into it, instead of in the hall, as all the others did. Thus the occupants of these rooms had to pass through mine. One of these apartments remaned vacant during my entire stay. , The companion who had been assigned to me in the play-room, and whose name was Kate Rosmond, oc- cupied the other. One of the teachers followed me to my sleeping- apartment and gave me some directions as to the dis- posal of my clothing and toilet-articles, and: with a kind good-night left me alone. Such a feeling of lone- liness came over me then as I never before experi- enced. I sat on my bedside, with hands crossed in my 2 <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6869-00000010"/> I8 .    WI' THE RAPIDS. lap and head drooped upon my breast, lacking even the energy to prepare for sleep. I ought to have  cried, I suppose. But that sort of relief, so common a resource of my sex, failed me at the time. I do not know how long I had been sunk in this dreamy, melancholy mood, when Hheard the door on one side of me gently open. Footsteps approached my bed- side. I looked up, and there stood my play-room  companion, in her night-dress; for, though the shut-  ters were closed, enough of bright moonlight came between the slats and through the snowy muslin cur- tains to enable me to recognize her. She put her arms round me in an affectionate manner, and with a show of confidence which was agreeable enough in my lonely and sorrowful condition, but of rather too early birth, it seemed tdme, to encourage so prompt  a return as was probably anticipated. However, whether observing my reluctance or not, she began a whispering and rapid chatter about things and persons of whom I knew nothing. But, the design being to amuse me, as I understood I took it all in good part,  and was a good deal cheered by the vivacity of her manner. Some anecdote or adventure of probably every girl in the house was told me, their names being repeated as glibly as if IPwere already the familiar friend of the whole school. The low, hurried whisper in which she spoke was peculiar, and gave me a some- what panful sense of the surreptitious character of the interview. From the nature of the subjects, I could have little to say; but, when I attempted a remark, my voice, not attuned to the delicate discretion hers had Xi It   attained, sounded comparatively loud, and seemed to alarm her, for a gentle admonitory word or gesture followed every attempt I made. So passed I know not how many hours of the night. I was loth to part with her, because the longer she talked the more entertaining she became, and j had ! not yet got familiarized with the loneliness to which her departure would consign me. When she did go, I she left me with a multitude of strange names ringing in my ears, and adventures of girl-life, such as had never before crossed my imagination, perplexing my t brain, and by no means disposing me for sleep. When I awoke in the morning from such slight slumber as I was, after much courting of it, able to. get, I found her up and dressed. For the first tifae, I began to observe closely her appearance. She would, at the first glance, have been called handsome, but a critical examination of her features must have removed that impression to some extent: it might rather be I said she had once been so. Signs of a mental devel-  opment beyond her years were not wanting in her. ex- pression; and, though it may seem like a strange com- bination, I persuaded myself that she had a temper at once both querulous and defiant. She had critical, searching eyes. The natural color in her face, instead of being smoothly and gradually diffused throughout, was gathered into one concentrated'and feverish-look- ing spot on each cheek, giving her a flushed appear- ance. No one would look for conciliation from her, but, on the contrary, for the opposite characteristics of a wilful and impetuousten)per. It was difficult for me    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6869-00000011"/> 20       IN THE RAPfDS.  to reconcile so much of this summing up of her char-  acter as I then made with the girlish, playful, winning  chat she had bestowed upon me the night before. It  would have been easier for me to persuade myself that  I had got the behavior and appearance of two different  persons confounded in my mind, than to credit the ex- t istence of such opposite peculiarities in the same indi- vidual. So it was, however. Incited by I know not what motive, she had bent herself with great facility to the task of engaging my good opinion by the exercise of qualities the very last for which her face would gain her credit, and indicating measurable'self-control. As ' I proceed, it will be seen that the want of this quality, or at least the disuse of it, was her greatest, her most freely-admitted, fault. I cannot reconcile the contra-  diction, but when I first observed it I became almost  afraid of the sway over those around her which it em-  powered and inclined her to exercise. If she could so unbend herself, so set aside her whole violent nature, for the valueless purpose of amusing an entire stranger,  what could she not do under powerful and enthralling motives? I soon began to estimate the influence upon each other of our intercourse, and at once admitted to , myself that the contest would be with her.  I will not be needlessly minute in the details of my  life at this school, so far as it relates to the object for  which children are usually sent to such places. My teachers, except in certain extraordinary particulars, which I shall describe, were scrupulously faithful in the performance of their duties, and, with like excep- A tion, my own behavior was beyond reprehension.   CHAPTER    III. own home had been ever so happy to me, my mother always so loving and dear, that the A most curious circumstance in the character of my new acquaintance was the absence of all fond allusion to her home, an evident dislike to hearing of it, an aver- sion, to use no stronger term,to its inmates or a part of them, towards whom her usually half-checked ut- terances sometimes rote to fierce vindictiveness. I had an early desire to know wherein her antecedents differed from my own; and, while I could ascertain but little from herself during our school life together, it was sufficient to inform me how to proceed towards gratifying my curiosity in after-days, not forgetting her, as the reader might otherwise suppose, through all the long period during which I observe silence in regard to her, but catching up the thread of her pre- vious history when opportunity offered. Most of it thus collected long afterwards, as I have said, I give here a connected account of her and her family down to the date of my acquaintance with her. Brothers, Ambrose and Charles Waring were left penniless and friendless orphans at so early an age that it was many a long day before life had any other meaning or hope for them than a struggle for existence. They worked together and had purse and (21) (2  IV         ' ' I     <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6869-00000012"/> 22      IN THE RAPIDS.          ! home in common until Charles married: ntt bettering his condition thereby, nor incited by the purpose of bettering it, but assuredly making it no worse; for he was never at any time so fixed that a change of any kind could make the state of his affairs more pitiable. He was one of that class of ne'er-do-well unfortunates, at every turn in whose pathway through life untoward Fate sets her traps and pitfalls. Ambrose, left to himself, worked successfully to improve his own circumstances. By reason of a not uncommon peryersion of natural feeling, he gradually withdrew his assistance from his brother in the strug- gle which they had begun right manfully together, as he grew more able to extend it and the other to need it more. Carking anxieties, withering cares, the 'de- pression of early and long-continued misfortune finally told upon the naturally feeble constitution of Charles, and brought the death, which is never all despair, in exchange for the living death of a life without hope. His wife dragged out a miserable year or two of widowhood, sustained for months by maternal solici- tude, in a state of such attenuated vitality that existence though evident seemed painfully impossible. Her only child, a daughter, thus orphaned, became the charge of Ambrose, who, although he had latterly denied to the parents that charity which strangers might rightfully have demanded, recognized the ne- cessity of taking care of their offspring. Whether from innate thirst for accumulating, or from unremitting dread of the return of the poverty which had steeped his youth in gall, the desire to r    '    *   IN THE RAPIDS.       23 grow rich had, by the time his brother died, become the absorbing, overmastering passion of Ambrose. Under its ever-present influence he forgot there was a God in heaven, upon whose goodness he depended for every breath he drew, and that his fellow-beings around him were created by that God. They were to him mere items of business use or speculation, whose a minds, bodies, skill, labor, fortunes, and misfortunes were to be reckoned up as merchandise to be traded : with and turned into money. Feeding the passions : and truckling to the vices of the rich, wringing the : last farthing of profit from the compelled labor of the : miserably poor,- tempting the thrifty ignorant into speculations of which he was to reap the profit and X they the loss,-by these and like means had this ! money-maker so increased his wealth and multiplied : the objects of his speculation, that when he took I charge of his brother's child it was scarcely within his I individual power prudently to invest the one or manage the other. His personal habits had very slightly, if at all, I changed with his pecuniary circumstances. The mi- , nutest details of his private and business expenditures : continued to receive his own attention, and he under- i took to extend this rule into the arrangements neces- sary for the comfort of his niece. He thus came in contact with objects and had his mind open to the admission of ideas capable of developing any tender- ness of which his nature was susceptible. Some little X softening of his manner resulted. He departed percep- !  tibly in his habits from the line of miserly economy it KX          -     <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6869-00000013"/> 24       IN, THE, RAPIDS.' had been his very life to follow.' As the child grew older, and came gradually to repay him, by the mere Ij   continued presence in his home of a person of her sex and helpless condition, for his care and interest, his domestic arrangements became more liberal. But, wise as he was in the wisdom most praised in the country of his birth and ihome, he was utterly at fault when he undertook to govern or direct the disposition of his charge. The most patient man that ever lived, in any undertaking involving pecuniary profit, the most dexterous manipulator of temperaments capable of serving his business purposes, he was compelled, after repeated trials, to abandon the task of controlling th If  temper and tastes of this child. Finally, he had but one rule for peace, unde' the annoyance of her in- creasingly extravagant and changeful demands,-but tj   one refuge from the disagreeable vagaries of her dis- t  position: he had to gratify the one and to learn how to submit to the other. By the time she had arrived at the threshold of womanhood she had so far learned her own power and his nature as to drive him into a style of living so artificial and lavish as almost to make him doubt his own identity. But before his affairs had assumed this shape he had become so rich that he had decided to relinquish active participation in business. Nevertheless, a morbid dread that pov- erty would overtake him, under a load of expenditure which he could not lessen, though in fact it was ridic- ulously small for a man of his wealth, drove him back into some of the innumerable petty operations which characterized his early business life. In respect to   N THE RAPIDS.       25 these the world had gone on in its changes and left him far behind, so that the annoyance of labors for which he had become unfitted was aggravated by their profitless results. Living in a happy country wh ,riqes e above learning and virtue, the fine hou; tl* 'rr s, din- ner and evening parties, ball and I eratets , ought on the usual pre-matrimonial inlentf 'h [hoice made by the niece from among th 'hrof o ad irers of herself or her prospective fo  &amp;d4iv the uncle's approval, in the first place, pe au se it was her choice and he had none but to indorse it; and then because the man selected, to u'se Ambrose's technicalities, was "of some account," had "done something," was not ",a nobody," had " made money do you understand?" He had made money. Ambrose, though entertaining a far from flattering I opinion of accounts and accountants, boasting that he ! had a head and a memory worth all your ledgers and I your day-books, departed this time from his skepti- cism in figures. After searching carefully for a scrap of paper of which no other use could be'made and i that would not sell for anything, he finally picked up the flap of a dismembered envelope from the floor, and with the stump of a lead-pencil entered, upon a pro- found calculation. By the time that he had quite covered the paper, dwarfing and cramping his figures as the process brought him down to thde narrow end  of his field of operations and limited the scope of his chirography, he arrived at the result that his niece had made a good investment. There was money enough,  <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6869-00000014"/> 26       IN TITE RAPIDS. actually and prospectively, on the two sides of the matrimonial partnership to :-make a dozen couples happy. This was his clear conclusion as he folded the  scrap of paper and laid it away in his pocket-book, possibly for future reference, possibly because the yet unoccupied side of it might come into use, and, it may be, with the thought that he would, by preserving the figures, insure the result of his calculations. It is a pity that opinions devised in such a head and  treasured in such a memory as his, after all should be gainsaid. But time soon deprived him of all the pride he ever took in the one formed on this occasion.  Certainlytiever was marriage undertaken with all the  material elements of happiness more abundantly pro- : vided. The husband was a prosperous merchant, and  the wife, in all probability, the heiress of a vast for- i tune. But, true it is, they had been wedded only a few months when the question: self-propounded t  each was, "What in the world did I marry for?"No congenialityof disposition existed from the first; and, while it is doubtful if they enjoyed each other's society  in the earlier days of their wedded life, it is certain that they could not long have been said to do more than tolerate it. From becoming conscious of the relief of being "rid" of one another, they passed into a studious avoidance of each other. The husband denied himself none of the pastimes of the young and gay of his time. He had his horses, his yacht, and his club, nd the propensity and means to gamble. He came, n time, almost to forget that he had a wife, notwith- standing that he and she continued as yet to have a  4, 9'  Cvi    IN THE RAPIDS.        27 home in common. His honorable sense of the ccn- nection was losing from day to day its hold upon his mind, like some annoyance of which one feels the diminishing effects while gradually becoming uncon- scious of the cause. But it was less easy for the wife to lighten the weight or to muffle the clanking of the chain which bound her. With fewer amusements suited to her tastes and position, her unfortunate situation was the almost constant subject of her thoughts. She felt all the bitterness of being neglected and despised where the world knew she was entitled to attention and respect, and the further bitterness of having earned that world's malevolence because she had first earned its envy. She had moments of loneliness and wretch- edness when she would have- undertaken anything, submitted to anything, if so she might change her husband's nature and habits, to the end that she could love him and so interest herself in him as, to elicit an answering affection. In spite of their mutual avoid- ance, they were sometimes necessarily thrown together in presence of each other's friends. His indifference then excited her anger, which sometimes expressed itself in bitter sarcasm, understood only by themselves, and sometimes in outspoken and detailed complaints. This disgraceful state of things was brought to a climax by an affectation, ridiculous on the part of such a husband, in regard to the particular grade of society to which he would require her to confine her acquaintance. This constituted the single exception to his rule of indifference towards her. Without attaching importance to the social ideas of so disso-    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6869-00000015"/> 28       IN THE RAPIDS. lute a man, it may be well to admit, with 'him, that there are necessarily differences of social position; and in no country are t  distinctions more jealously  maintained than in one where no hereditary or privi-  leged ranks or titles exist to mark, at all times and under all circumstances, the mystic "circles." Each grade is jealous of encroachments from below, and: equally solicitous of condescending visits from above. In the present instance the wife seceded from a circle  into which her marriage had elevated her, but wherein her chief entertainment was the echo of scandalous gossip about her conjugal relations, to descend into one wherein, it must be confessed, she found more con-  genial tastes and habits,-less wealth, it is true, and  less fashion, but, if the testimony of intelligent and sensitive experience be worthy of credit, also less of the great world's portion of sin and sorrow. Occupying separate apartments, she and her hus- band had not met face to face for ionths; but he had seen her at the theatre, and knew of her visiting other  places, public and private, with people whose presence about a person bearing his name annoyed him excess-  ively. The pleasure she derived from the society of her new-formed friends tempted her into certain un- l guarded but innocent liberties of action. Returning  on one occasion from a visit to the country, an acci- dent occurred, disordering and soiling her dress and delaying her arrival home. She reached the house at  a late hour of the night, attended by some of her com- panions of the day, and at the same moment her hus-  band came up. He regarded her for some time with   IN THE RAPIDS.       29 a fixed, offensive stare, as if it were not without an effort that he recognized her in such company; She, wearied, rendered nervous by the accident, and con- .- scious that she had been imprudent, awaited but a single word of gentleness from her husband to offer atoning explanations. But no such word came. He vented his pent-up vexation in indiscriminate and out- rageous abuse. She retaliated in kind; and the mis- erable scene ended not until, so far as it was possible for language to produce such an effect, each had be- come to the other an object of irreconcilable hatred and unqualified disgust. Old Ambrose was not a frequent visitor at the house. There was adstyle, air, ceremony-what not- about its appointments and ways that kept the home- spun old money-maker ill at ease when he was in it. As his niece's husband had " done something," " made money," " wasn't. a nobody," the old man had a mod- erate respect for him, which up to this point had kept back any objurgation he might have felt disposed to offer in regard to that gentleman's conjugal short- comings. It so happened that one of his rare visits was made on the morning following the scene just described between this unhappy pair, and which had been renewed on the husband's part only a few mo- ments before Ambrose arrived. The latter was re- markable for the control he always exercised over his temper. So perfectly pliant was he to every uneven- ness of mood or manners he encountered in his busi- ness life, that he was frequently called "the unanimous man." But the temper was nevertheless in him, and 3*    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6869-00000016"/> 30 30       IN THE RAPIDS.  the foul accusations he heard flung at his niece aroused it in fury.                 r Hitherto the husband had overawed him, kept him suppressed, by his supercilious, patronizing, and, to  speak truly, impudent manner. But on this occa- sion the old money-maker broke down the barrier. He had kept himself advisqd of the turn affairs had  taken in his niece's household, and he astounded the man as much by his knowledge, as by the fierce energy of his language. Hte would listen to no reply, but stormed on at will, and made such manifestations of the possession and confidence of physical strength that the husband cowered like a whipped cur before him. After the marriage, Ambrose, left to himself, had gone  back to the inexpensive life of his early days, and had  become so hardened in his penurious economy that hardly any other case of charity or justice could have  A induced him to trench ^upon it. But he determined to  take back his 'niece, as her husband had expressed a wish to be rid of her, and the scene closed with her '; leaving her unhappy home under his protection.  Shortly afterwards a daughter was prematurely born  to her. The child gave precocious proof of having in-  herited the loose morals of its father and the wayward  tastes and uncontrollable temper of its mother. The  latter, kept in seclusion by her dubious position, im- bibed morbid, erratic ideas of life, which were speedily  reflected in the child. * She became continually more  fretful and peevish from the causes already mentioned, and yet more so from contemplating the dangerous vagaries of her child, which she had not the tact or firm-   IN THE RAPIDS.       31 ness to repress. To complain, and scold, and predict evil, was the mother's monotonous employment; in- subordination, discontent, and contempt of warning, the daughter's daily indulgence. The uncle contented himself with giving them both instructions in retrench- ment of particular expenses and in domestic economy generally. He remembered how he had failed in his experiment to manage the disposition of the mother, and thought it useless to undertake the child. This child was Kate Rosmond. JJ         ,    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6869-00000017"/> CHAPTER    IV. KATE      ROSMOND became my favorite, I may almost say my only, companion. Though, by my natural reserve, I was not inclined to associate with the scholars generally, any other than she would have been quite as likely to win my confidence, and my selection of her is to be attributed, in a measure, to the incident of her being the first to overcome, by her attention and kind words, the feeling of loneliness which attended my introduction to the school. But the arrangement of our sleeping-apartments, admitting of long and intimate conversation during the night, when the other scholars were strictjy separated, had doubtless more to do with it. Whether she had been so exclusive before nmy coming I am unable to say; but her demeanor and her character, as far as it was indicated by her countenance, suggested as much. Her figure was tall and commanding, and her expres- sion habitually one of haughtiness. Her face was re- markably thin for a person of her age, but the outline was, to my eyes, handsome. There was perhaps an undue projection of the -chin, and too great dilation of the thinly-cut nostril, as well as too much compression generally about the meagre lips, to entitle her to this term from the casual observer. But the great brilliancy of her black eyes, which were unusually small, and the ( 32)  IN THE RAPIDS.        33 bright color which under no circumstances deserted her cheeks, never failed to attract and retain attention. Her hair, which was not abundant, was always kept combed back close over her ears. There was one peculiarity in her countenance which for a long time I tried in vain to account for, and I doubt if I under- stood it until we had separated and I had studied it out from recollection; and, in fact, this description of her is drawn rather from memory than from what ap- peared during m} school-days to my inexperienced eyes. This peculiarity was an undue concealment of the upper part of the pupil of the eye,-not from drawing down the eyelid, but from keeping the ball unusually elevated. e It would occur to an observer that it arose from a habit of examining surreptitiously the counte- nances of others, and it certainly imparted to her an unpleasant and sinister expression, which, however, disappeared when shfe was either pleasurably or pain- fully excited. Her sole rule of action was ler desires. I cannot recall a single instance in which she referred the doing or abstaining from anything to any moral prin- ciple or the compensating rules of conduct which pre- vail in ordinary human intercourse. She never debated what she would or would not do, but decided at once, and immediately acted upon her decision. This was the case in every matter, however insignificant or im- portant; and she became completely absorbed in what- ever she undertook. Her expression, while employed, and especially at anything about which she had en- countered opposition, was one of intense determination    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6869-00000018"/> 34       IN TZHE RAPIDSS. altogether unfeminine, I might almost say, inhuman; and I confess I was often alarmed at her appearance. It might be asked why I sought the companionship of such a being. My only answer is, the weakness of 'my own nature. I leaned for support on her stronger will from the beginning, because, while I was still a comparative stranger to the discipline of the school,  she removed or taught me to overcome every difficulty I encountered. My dwn moral sense had been carefully cultivated by my mother, and, while looking up to this  strange creature in what I may designate physical emergencies, I decided for myself as to the right and wrong of things, and, for a time, always followed my own instincts or education in such matters. I am afraid, however, it will appear that the kind of mas-  tery she obtained at first, and which I have already acknowledged, extended its control. I became so ac-  customed to depend on her in some things that an  inclination to conciliate her occasionally induced me  to agree to what was wrong and to leave the right un- done. How far her moral obliquity carried her from the right path, and how much she had to do with what I would wish had not happened in my own history, will appear to whomsoever pursues these pages to  the end; but there occurs to me just now a trifling  circumstance which illustrates her resolute and per-  severing nature. One night, which we had nearly spent in talking,  she desired me to sleep with her. I did not wish to do so. She at once decided the natter in favor of her own inclination, by catching mre up in her arms and   IN THE RAPIDS.        35 carrying me to her room, and, hurrying back, dragged the mattress, pillow, and bedclothes from off my bedstead, took them into her room, and, removing the coverings of her own couch, put the two mattresses together, and so 'made ,a bed which I was compelled to occupy with her. Wte had hardly lain down before she missed a ring fom her finger, and at once deter- mined to find it befdre going to sleep. I begged her to defer the search until the morning, but to no pur- pose. She was provided with candles, contrary to the rules, and had contrived a pasteboard lantern which enabled her to use them without casting a treacherous reflection over the partition of the alcove. Thus equipped, she commenced a search which, though noiseless, left nothing unturned in either my apart- ment or hers. I fell asleep during its progress, and she awoke me for the purpose of thoroughly examin- ing the bed. Still the ring was not brought to light; i but she spied a trifling rent in the top of my mattress, and immediately concluded that the lost article was there. The next moment she had the mattress on the floor, and, making up her bed as at first, bade me get in and go to sleep again. This I did right willingly, and left her to her task. Awaking at an early hour in the morning, I beheld my companion seated on the floor, all the hair from the mattress piled up before her. She had taken it out, as she afterwards told me, handful by handful, and care- fully picked each little parcel over. She had just finished this as my ees first rested on her, and now proceeded to turn the mattress, which she had ripped    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6869-00000019"/> 36       IN THE RAPIDS.  at one end, inside out, and she actually found the ring within it. I assisted her to refill arid sew up the mat- tress and to rearrange the bed: everything was in order by the time the class-bell rang. One apparent inconsistency in the conduct of Kate was her remaining at the school at all, submitting to  the confinement, and attending to the duties required of her. This can be accounted for by supposing it to  have been, for her, a choice of evils; for if she left the  school, under ordinary circumstances, it could only be  to go home, and her home evidently possessed no attraction for her. She rarely spoke of it or of her  mother,-then only casually and in a manner that in-  dicated, to express it in the mildest form, very little , regard for either.  The day on which the school-term was to end, so strangely called the "commencement," approached.  The usual routine for the occasion was to be varied by  a new feature: we were to have a fancy dress ball. i Those of us whose height, shape, and age were suit- ; able were selected to personate and (shall I tell it?) to J dress as gentlemen. I looked with great disfavor on  thk thing. There was something repugnant to my sense of modesty about it, and I have never ceased to wonde'r how our worthy principal could conceive so foolish, not to say vicious, an idea. My opposition to it was greatly increased by the fact that I was selected to assume a male character; and I immediately made known my resolution not to undertake it. In this  matter, however, as in too many others, Kate had her way with me. She likewise had to personate a gen-   IN THE RAPIDS.        7 X' , ,  tleman, and it offered to her the ever-welcome sensa- tion of n eFciting novelty, She entered into the affair' with the liveliest zest; and, after listening to my objec- tions and answering them in a style that she deemed conclusive, she proceeded to make arrangements for her dress and my own. At that time I knew nothing of plays or the theatre, and therefore there exists no mental association by which I can recall the charac- ters we personated. I felt dissatisfied, and took no interest in the exhibition, going through what I had to do as a mere automaton. But I remember that both dresses were of a kind that gave me very uncom- fortable notions of their impropriety, and were dazzling with spangles and crimson trimming. Kate received hers and put it on during my absence from our rooms, which we had for some time been using in common. She had likewise dressed her hair as much like a  man's as possible. As she was thus attired, I tripped unceremoniously into the room. I positively did not recognize her, and was so astonished and startled by her appearance that I turned to run. She caught and held me, laughing until tears ran down her cheeks at my evident consternation. "You did not know me, Cora? Well, that is grand! It is just what I purposed. There is something about this unlike any pleasure I ever felt before. It is So delightful to fancy yourself some one else! If I have deceived even you, I have entered into the character more truly than I hoped. Now you must put on your own dress and let me look at you." 4    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6869-00000020"/> 38   do    IN THE RAPIDS. "If it is anything like yours," I said, "I will not do so." "It is very much like mine," she answered, "but less conspicuously trimmed. Here, see for yourself. It has just come." I examinesl't, and refused to try it on, saying it would be useless, for I would not wear it at the ball or in the presence of the other scholars. Kate perse- vered in her usual positive style, and finally persuaded me to gratify her by merely showing her how I would look in it. I complied, most reluctantly; and when at last I was completely attired, I felt like running away and hiding myself. But, Kate drawing my arm through hers, we promenaded the length of our two rooms, she diverting my attention from myself by her conversation, which she could make exceedingly at- tractive when it was her humor to do -so. After a time the dress felt somewhat more natural, and I finally consented to wear it, resolving, however, to make certain alterations in it which should divest it to a marked degree of its masculine and immodest character, and to remove a great part of the gaudy trimmings. This I finally did without Kate's knowl- edge, and took care not to put it on, for my appear- ance among the others at the final assembling, until it was too late to alter it. The ball took place as arranged. It was a pleasur- able and exciting affair for all engaged in it; for even I enjoyed the music and the exhilaration of dancing. Kate's appearance created a sensation'which it would not be easy to describe. We were American girls, so a   IN THE RA PIDS. 39 -we called her "splendid." There was an occasional shrug of disapproval, but her entire self-control and her -air of defiance prevented audible criticism,-the more -so because so many others fell short, in appearance and manner, of the characters assigned to them. There were some instances in which the aspirants were too successful; and assuredly more of them made the effort than I should have thought possible had not the spectacle of immodesty passed before my eyes. A supper, at a late hour, closed the extraordinary entertainment. Our appetites were sharpened by the exercise we had taken, and by the loss of several hours of customary sleep. There was a great variety of highly-seasoned meats, ices, and confectionery, and, confined as we had been for months to the plainest though a substantial and abundant diet, the feast was partaken of with a pleasure which only those who re- joice in our unimpaired digestive powers can realize. The apartment devoted to the ball was the same which had been used for the exhibition during the day; and the platform at one end, that had been occu- pied by the scholars, accommodated, during the ball, certain of their invited female relatives. The admis- sion of any male visitor was strictly forbidden. Never- theless, a young gentleman, who probably came as an escort to one of the permitted spectators, effected an entrance "in the course of the evefning. My atten- tion was first directed to him by Kate's frequent and earnest glances in his direction. He could be dis- tinctly seen from only one portion of the floor, and to this position she betook herself whenever disen- ,    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6869-00000021"/> 40       IN THE RAPIDS. gaged. After awhile his presence became generally known, and some of the scholars remonstrated. The teachers made an effort to induce hint to retire. But by the influence of the person who accompanied him -probably one' of the patrons of the school-he man- aged to remain. If I have succeeded in conveying a correct idea of Kate's appearance, it will be readily understood that the uninvited spectator bent his gaze steadily on her; and his attention, at once interpreted into admiration, gratified and excited her. As the entertainment drew to a close, the relatives of some two or three of the scholars, who were to leave for their homes at once, descended from the stage to the floor. Others fol- lowed them, urged by curiosity to examine the dresses, as well as to identify those who had so appareled themselves as to be unrecognizable from the platform; and finally all the guests came upon the floor, making a confusion of movement, conversation, and laughter in which all order and discipline were lost. And the teachers, who until then had maintained perfect con- trol of the giddy throng, forgot themselves in partak- ing of and adding to the general bustle. I lost sight of Kate for awhile, and when I found her she was con- versing with the gentleman and an elderly lady who was leaning on his arm. I blushed for the predica- ment in which she had put herself; but my delicate consideration for her would have been thrown away even if she had been aware of it. She was evidently enjoying what appeared so absurd and unfeminine to me.   - i IN THE RAPIDS.        4 As the visitors slowly took their leave and the scholars retired from the room, Kate, at the summons of one of the teachers, had to bid adieu to her newly- formed acquaintances. She walked moodily from the apartment, and, proceeding immediately to her room, went to bed in silence. My own mind was filled with unpleasant thoughts, and-though for opposite rea- sons, no doubt-I felt quite disposed to imitate her taciturnity. In the morning I found her sitting on the side of the bed, in her night-dress, her head drooped upon her breast, her hands crossed in her lap, and her eyes bent upon the floor. She raised herself as I came in, and looked at me abstractedly. "I am perplexed, and I am unhappy, Cora," said she. "I have endured this school now for five years; and the same dull, monotonous round of life, without even the change of home for a few weeks, as the others have, makes me weary of myself. At every vacation the happy freedom of the children at the prospect of holiday and the sweets of home makes me feel so desolate. The gloomy house of my uncle, and the wretched quarrels with my mother, which began as far back as my memory, and ended only when I came away, present the only alternative for the dreary dulness which always (unless I am intensely occupied) possesses me here." "You appeared happy last evening. You evidently enjoyed the ball," I replied. "I have never seen you so entertained," "Yes! But that is over, and to-day I feel the worse 4*    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6869-00000022"/> 42     -XIN THE RAPIDS. for the excitement." She paused a moment, and then, "To be candid with you, Cora, I am thinking of that gentleman. I imagine if the feeling of love were once aroused within me it would absorb all my thoughts, and I should be happy, for I should forget myself. Is it not ridiculous for such an idea to be excited by a person whom I never saw before? 'Love at first sight,' you may say. But I do not altogether admire him: any other man would probably have produced the same effect. There are ideas floating through my brain, and sensations rising in my heart, which pro- duce the strangest conflict. Something says to me, 'Don't be a fool.' Something else says, 'Keep dwell- ing on this gentleman's image, and whatever is dis- agreeable in him will disappear; keep, thinking about him. Pleasant fancies will arise; then the. wretched past will be forgotten, the future will appear beautiful, and life will become a delightful dream.'" "Well, but, Kate," I said, "the whole thing will be only a dream; and you must, after all, awaken to the reality, and be all the more wretched for it. You will, in all likelihood, never see the gentleman again; or, if you do, he may not have the slightest fancy for you." "Yes, but I can see him, I have no doubt," she quickly and earnestly rejoined; and the determined expression I have previously described came into her face. "He has just graduated in medicine, but will remain some time yet in the city. Our teachers are acquainted with the old lady who accompanied him. I can trace him up and throw myself in his way. I am sure he fancied me."  -If   IN THE RAPIDS.        43 "Throwing yourself in his way, as yoi express it, would be so wrong,-so unwomanly!"I objected. "I don't care! I don't care! I dont care!" she ex- claimed, in determined reiteration. "Something tells me I shall see him again." It was evident that a point had been reached in the affair'where her usual rule of action-her uncontrolla- ble will-had full sway, and I ceased to reply to her. After some moments of silence, she said,- "You are going home?" "I am, Kate." "When?" "To-morrow." "Will they come for you, or are you going alone?" "I am going alone." "Can you not remain a week longer with me, and write home to that effect?" I reflected an instant before replying. I was anxious to see my parents, and they doubtless were impatiently awaiting my coming. -But I could plainly foresee that Kate, deprived of my society, would do something foolish or wrong while this absurd fit was upon her, and I concluded to wait a day or two. A fatal conclusion for me! It was an event of at least weekly occurrence for visitors to present themselves for a stroll through the premises. The institution was one of the most famous in the country, and its extensive and complete arrange- ments in, every department rendered it a prominent object of interest to sight-seers visiting the city. Generally an assistant teacher, but sometimes one    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6869-00000023"/> "x      IN THE RAPIDS.- of the elder scholars, officiated as guide for these people. I was several times invited to serve in that capacity. When it happened to be inconvenient to give them all immediate attention, one pat0woul be detained in the reception-room until it-was joined by one, two; or three other sets, so that the room would be quite full before the tedious procession could be started through long passages, up and down inter- minable flights of stairs, in and out of rooms, and lastly over the grounds, for the several views which afforded almost the'only correct idea of the construc- tion and arrangement of the buildings. These had been originally planned on a small scale, but had been gradually enlarged as necessity required; and the effort to harmonize the successively new styles of architecture with the original design produced, to the casual visitor's eye, a bizarre and unartistic effect: which however soon rendered the place homelike and familiar to the scholars. On the morning succeeding the exhibition, all the pupils departed except Kate and myself and three quite young children, orphan sisters: I think they were  Cubans. All the teachers, including the principali had likewise arranged to leave on a visit of recrea- tion-save one. In the afternoon, visitors were an- nounced by the single remaining servant. Miss Carey, the teacher, sent to ask Kate and myself to6 attend to them. On entering the reception-room we found an elderly lady, two young girls, and-the un-! welcome visitor at the ball!         ' As we entered, Kate flashed at me a glance which   VN THE RAPIDS.       . plainly said, "I told you so." On being introduced, we learned that mother, son, and nieces were named Etheridge. Kate and the son engaged in conversa- tion with a freedom that would have convinced apy one not knowing the circumstances that they had been intimately acquainted all their lives. I availed myself of the opportunity to observe him particularly. He was a stout man, with heavy gray eyes and sandy hair. He talked with remarkable fluency, and laughed incessantly, in a sort of chuckle which annoyed me very much. I thought it was unnatural, and it made me dislike him. When we started to go through the house, Kate, without the slightest attempt to disguise the manceuvre, took her place with the gentleman behind the rest of the party, and so f their con- versation became inaudible. When negrounds, in due course, were reached, they passed out of sight, be- hind a row of box-trees, whose relation to the general plan I will describe hereafter. Mrs. Etheridge com- plaining of fatigue, we returned to the house, leaving Kate and her companion, very much to my chagrin, alone; and it was not until word was sent to them that the rest were tired of waiting, that they made their appearance.  "Now, Kate," I began, as soon as the visitors had gone. "Now, Cora," she interrupted, " don't say anything. You are going to scold, and I do not like people who scold; I had enough of that at home." The grounds formed a quadrangle, bounded by the buildings on one side and by walls on the other three.    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6869-00000024"/> "      ZN THE RAPIDS.  A gravelled walk about two yards wide extended all round, next to the walls, and the inner edge of it was bordered by a hedge of very old box-trees nearly as high as the walls. There was an opening through the hedge midway of each side of the square. The inner area, bounded by the trees, was a smooth lawn, with a clump of rose-bushes in each corner, a fountain in the centre (supplied from a reservoir-at the top of the main building), and a circle of earth, banked up around this fountain, crowned with low flowering shrubs. The scholars had the run of this pleasure-domain from tea-time, which was always early, until dusk, and the older girls, on a holiday, for two or three hours later. Of course this privilege was extended during vacation to such as remained, the only restriction being that there should never be fewer than three together. We prevailed upon Miss Carey to make an exception in our favor, which she was not the less willing to do because it would be her task to accompany us in order to complete the trio at this time; and we had been so invariably observant of all the rules that she had no reason to fear we would make improper use of the privilege. This lady was given iovermuch to books, and I believe affected authorship, for she laid down her book only to take up her pen, which scratched away unremittingly for hours at a time during the vacations. Kate, who well understood certain phases of human nature, could worry her into granting almost any indulgence while she was thus engaged; aidd it was quite certain that she sometimes granted requests she had not heard, so complete was her abstraction. In   IN THE RAPIDS.        47 -,this way, after repeated refusals, Kate obtained posses- sion of a duplicate key of a small gate which was at the end of the wall dividing the grounds from the street in the rear, another key being in the possession of the private watchman. This street in the rear was a very wide one, and was occupied by large and hand- some dwellings. The bed of the street, where the little gate opened, was occupied, with the exception of a narrow space on each side, by a rectangular grass-plot inclosed with iron railings. Two squares above us anl two below were similarly embellished. It was a beautiful location and a favorite promenade. lThe third evening after the exhibition, Kate got possession of the key. Without explaining at each successive step my own conduct in partially counte- nancing and joining in her repeated and progressive lapses from decorum, I will here say, once for all, at a point where she took a leap rather than a step in the wrong direction, that I asked myself then, as I have done a thousand times since, could my direct inter- ference have effected any good? I am convinced that it could not. She would have carried her point in defiance of any opposition short of absolute physical restraint. I therefore do not blame myself for what befell her. But the whole matter was hurtful to my moral sense, and, had I listened to its dictates at the outset, I should have been spared the unfortunate ad- venture which my complicity with her brought upon myself. - I use the term "unfortunate" because it is the one I would naturally be expected to employ in this con-    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6869-00000025"/> 48       .N THE RAPIDS. nection. But, though that adventure has brought suffering to others in such measure that I can never render myself worthy of their forgiveness, though my life has been diverted by it from all proper and health- ful purpose and become a mere tissue of trouble and anguish, I am conscious of an indescribable satisfac- tion, nay, a positive, underlying, ever-manifest joy, that would have had otherwise ao existence, and which banishes the idea of misfortune from my own concep- tion of my history. If what I am writing be ever read at all, it may find a few readers who can so far enter into my feelings as to comprehend this. Even in the bare possibility of that, I have a priceless consolation. Having satisfied ourselves that Miss Carey was pro- foundly absorbed in her interminable scribbling, we opened the gate and passed into the street. It was not quite dusk. Some children were trundling hoops up and down the pavements, and other children, in charge of nurses, were promenading or playing. Ladies, some alone, others accompanied by gentlemen, were passing to and fro. The neighboring residences probably fur- nished their share of the promenaders, as most of these ladies were, like ourselves, without bonnet or veil. Kate had been nervous and irritable all the after- noon. There was an unusual flush upon her cheeks  and a light in her eyes that told of anxious expecta- tion. After passing into the street, we strolled leisurely up and down the pavement of our own square two or three times, both of us preserving silence. My com- panion began to grow agitated, and I could see,   IN THE RAPIDS.       .49 uncertain as the light was, that her face expressed dis- appointment. Suddenly, behind us, a man's voice bade us "good-evening." We turned, to behold Mr. Etheridge, as I expected when we first came out. It is to be supposed that at their second interview he had told Kate that his usual evening walk led him that way, and that she had men- tioned that egress through the gate was a possible addition to her regular privilege of walking about the same time in the grounds. There was a show of feigned surprise on the part of both. But he joined unceremoniously in our leisurely stroll, and ran on in the same glib style of talk which had struck me so unpleasantly at our interview in the parlor. His remarks were of the most commonplace character, and were addressed to us both; and he enjoyed a monopoly of talk, for I had really nothing to say, and Kate, usually so loquacious, appeared to enjoy in silence the very sound of his voice. For three successive evenings we met him in is way. On the fourth he-appeared in company with another gentleman, both talking earnestly.  must have come upon us rather unexpectedl , ior Etheridge was somewhat disconcerted. His 'm- panion, seeing him about to join us, was in the act of moving away, when Etheridge, as if with a sudden thought, caught him by the hand, detaining him, and said,- "Here, Manning, let me introduce you. I think I can venture upon the liberty of doing so." 5    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6869-00000026"/> 50       IN THE RAPIDS. On hearing us named, the person thus presented, made an impatient though graceful bow, and passed on, halting a few paces off, in evident expectation that his companion would presently continue the walk with . him. But Etheridge and Kate hurried quickly away, leaving me alone with the stranger. This looked so like a trick upon us both that it mortified and con- fused me, and I stood without speaking or moving. The gentleman broke the embarrassing silence by asking me,- "Had we not better walk, miss? Shall we follow your friends?" Our eyes met at the instant, and, as they did so, his countenance suddenly assumed an expression of gratified surprise. It was such an expression as one would look for in the face of an old friend unex- pectedly encountered. It passed at once away, how- ever, and a shadow as of sad reflection settled in its place. I was blushingly conscious of having involun- tarily answered smile with smile, for I felt sure, at least while his pleased look lasted, that I was regard- ing a not unfamiliar face. A thrill of emotion which sensibly stopped the action of my heart, and the next moment sent the agitated blood to my cheeks, followed this strange, apparent recognition. I would have been glad to escape and be alone, in order to disentangle the confused medley of my ideas and allay the tumult of my emotions. We walked on, as my companion proposed. I ex- pected him to ask or offer some explanation of the feeling of which both were conscious. Instead of that, !   IN THE RAPIDS.        51 he began, by a series of indirect questions delicately put, to inquire what had been, as far back as I could remember, the subjects which most closely engaged my attention,-what my favorite amusements,-what books I had read, and which of them with most pleasure. I answered with the greatest freedom; in- deed, all I had to say was in the way of reply. The tone of his voice and his manner were irresistibly kind, and I was soon persuaded that neither idle curi- osity nor the mere filling up of time was the object of these inquiries. There was an earnestness and a con- sistent sequence in them which forbade any such un- flattering conclusion. His questions grew gradually more particular, until, finally, every detail of my daily life had been recounted. Meanwhile time had sped rapidly, and Kate, coming up, notified me of the necessity of retiring. It may be understood how absorbed I was in what had just passed, when I state that I did not for an instant think how shamefully indecorous it must have ap- peared to Mr. Manning to see Kate and myself steal- ing in at the back gate of the school. - When we reached our rooms, Kate burst into a loud, coarse laugh at me for imitating the behavior I had so frequently rebuked in her. As for myself, I gave way to a flood of tears. The spell the stranger's voice and presence had put upon me was, for that time at least, broken by his absence. Although the singular interview had left a sense of pleasure behind it, it was followed by a reaction, during which I be- came astonished and almost disgusted at myself for    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6869-00000027"/> 52       IN THE RAPIDS. having talked so long, so openly and familiarly with a man who a few hours before was an utter stranger to me. Nevertheless, on the next day, as the hour approached at which he had made his appearance, I felt a nervous desire to be again in his society, having reasoned my- self into and out of every imaginable excuse for per- petrating the impropriety of seeking it,-ready at one instant to run out at the gate and watch for him, and prepared the next to compel a surrender of the gate- key to Miss Carey, so as to render it impossible. Nothing had been said between him and me about meeting again, and while I encouraged myself to go with the thought that he would not be there to meet me, and so no wrong be done, I was yet ready toiweep in the contemplation of such an escape from error. The mysterious familiarness of his person, voice, and manner haunted me through all this period of irreso- lution; and the intense curiosity it provoked led me to compromise with my doubts and misgivings by the conclusion to see him only once more, if possible, to satisfy it. He and Mr. Etheridge joined us that evening. The interview deepened all the impressions of the&amp;first, and, instead of being sufficient, rendered a third more in- tensely longed for and more anxiously sought. A fourth and fifth took place; and then I ceased to de- bate with myself as to the right or wrong of what I was doing. I had no wish but to see him; no fear of anything but the possible interruption of our inter- views. I   CHAPTER V. T  HE tranquillity which pervaded all I had hitherto known of life was to pass away. A new element had entered into my being, imparting a sense of pos- sible joy higher than I had known in the past; but there entered with it a shadowy terror which bade me bear in mind that, while the joy was only possible, I was parting with a sweet serenity of spirit that might return no more forever. But day by, day the joy loomed more brightly up, and the shadowy terror passed for the while away. My earliest application of the feelings that, with gradual and persistent power, filled my heart, was the relation which I made him who inspired them bear to my future earthly life. His image was in every pic- ture- and beautiful pictures they were-painted by my now enlivened fancy on the happy years that were to come. He equally, though not at first so con- fessedly, filled my present; for assuredly the present, deprived of the thoughts and actions which his pres- ence or my memories of him inspired, would have had no existence for me. I cannot say what day or hour the thought of him became completely and without reserve my controlling influence. I confess I cannot say how long after I first saw him it was not so. That confidence which precedes and inspires affection, and 5*      (53)    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6869-00000028"/> 54       IN THE RAPIDS. which is usually the result of long and intimate com- panionship, had its sufficient foundation at the very outset, in his strangely familiar face, tone, gesture, car- riage, everything. He came as though he had been my friend in some previous state of existence, or as if his image had won my willing heart in a forgotten dream. The very mystery of our mutual recognition, like everything mysterious, intensified the power of the spell which overcame me. What wonder that, thus impressed and thus tempted, I should love'? Why should I not yield to a passion which has dethroned the strongest intellects, broken the will of the fiercest men, and bestowed nerves of iron on the frailest  women? Plainly, then, I did love. I granted him the  full measure of an .affection that has never varied in force or direction. I pen these lines at a period when the vagaries of youth have passed and its illusions are dispelled, but I love him now, and shall love him as long as my identity remains. I feel that it is simply impossible that it should ever be otherwise. Less than one short month sufficed, not merely to  create, ripen, develop this affection, but to draw its sweet confession from my lips. And what an age was compressed in that brief time! I would gladly un-  dergo, ten times over, all that I have suffered since, to  bring one hour of it back. It is possible that, if our intercourse had been of un- interrupted accord, I might have questioned the reality of my happiness. It appears to be the fate of weak natures to doubt in the very assurance of certainty, and to hope more strongly in the midst of doubt and   IN THE RAPIDS.       55 when ruin is the only alternative of success. Some things did occur which were strange in themselves, and which might have shaken the affection or the faith of one less completeIy absorbed than myself. I clung the more closely to the author of them. Sometimes he would strike upon a train of thought from some turn in our conversation, and, while in- dulging for a time in such speculations as by a mar- vellous command of language he made me clearly understand, he would gradually rise beyond my con- ceptions, becoming apparently forgetful of my pres- ence. He -had the other faculty of going back with, me, in imagination, to the remotest memory of my childhood, decoying me into the merest idle prattle about the simplest things. 'On one such occasion, when I was running on as I would do to a younger schoolmate, he suddenly interrupted me, saying,- "No man before did ever risk upon a single cast such wealth of labor in the past and such great hopes in the future as I venture now. Take care, Cora, take care that there be not a single doubt within you. If there be, resolve it now. Wz will either be happy indeed, or you had better never have been born." Suddenly chcked in my girlish glee by the stern- ness with which tfese words were uttered, as much as by the words themselves, I became for a moment confused, and could make no response. His eyes were at the time fully bent on mine, and as my hesitation continued I could perceive the glimmer of rising anger within them. 'A shadow, as of pain, passed over his features, then the blood forsook his face, and a dark-    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6869-00000029"/> 56       IN THE RAPIDS. ness settled upon it, so threatening that he lost all re- semblance to himself. I could almost believe that, by some-magic, he had disappeared and another had taken ' his place. "You hesitate; you doubt," he said. "Well, I should h*ve known as much. What better could I  expect from a love that sprang up almost at my first word? I should have restrained instead of encouraging I it. I ought to have planted its germ and left you to  nurture it and to rear it, and not set it full-grown in an unprepared heart. I looked for the fruit too soon.  You do not love me at all."  - I was choking with my efforts to speak. To ex- press, in some way, that his anger had been needlessly  excited, and that it had not aroused retaliatory feelings in my breast, I seized and kissed his reluctant hand.  He said,-                    X "I almost wish, Cora, you had not given me that  proof At this moment I despair of everything, and would, if I could, give you back the quietude you  enjoyed so lately. While just now you were going backward over the track of life and toying with the recollection of childish trifles, I, with overwrought an- ticipation, was looking too far into the future. You  are so young, Cora, your feelings are so fresh and guileless, that for me to quit the common world and come within the atmosphere which surrounds you, is like bathing in the sunlight after the long gloom of the Arctic night. If you could always remain as you are, growing no older in feeling, and learning nothing of the wretched world you are in, it would be equal   IN THE RAPIDS.        57 desecration to love you or to inspire you with a mere human affection. Men are tortured with the doubt- and I am only a man-that what they have planted in their hearts as purity is only such because a hedge of ignorance has resisted its ranker development, and whether in the fire of that knowledge by which, in our very selfishness, we would try it, the being we loved may not be lost, and another come forth to hate us and inspire us with hate. "It is out of the evil of man's own heart that this doubt comes, as from him comes the knowledge he fears will destroy. Cora, no man who has reached the age when suspicion begins, and who has courage to sound the depths of his own heart, but finds evil there. I have done so, and I doubt that you love me with an affection which would endure beyond the knowledge that I have of myself." 'I understood only the general purport of what he said. The language, however, is exact, for I used to console myself, when away from him, by writing down his words. At the time it conveyed merely the idea of sincere deprecation of himself; and I answered,- "I can think of no future more dismal for me than one without you. If I -am sure of you, I am willing to leave the rest to Providence." H- rejoined, "Yes, you have scarcely passed the age when we are guided solely by "ur sensations, pursuing often to our ruin the object 'of desire, and, when it is won, forgetting for what it is wanted. I would be more hopeful if you reasoned more." "I have not reasoned, nor can I; I do not wish to. j     a,            r1    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6869-00000030"/> 58       IN THE RAPIDS. I can think- only of you. If reasoning would lead me away from you, I would not follow it." "Well, well, it is time to say good-night." And so we parted for the time. What is called woman's pride must either not be  innate or else it lies dormant until we reach a certain age. I have either acquired it or it has been aroused in me since; and I can now see, in the language I have  recorded, what might properly have excited my re- K sentment. I might have been more just to myself if  I had been guided by some such feeling. But I had already, in language dictated by my heart, freely con-  fessed his absolute control. If there be anything de- basing, unwomanly, about this, it was altogether in I the first admission. And, if the wrong lies there, let her who is without the sin, or without the desire to commit it, cast the first stone. Haying gone so far, these apparently untoward scenes weakened neither  my desire nor my hope that the rightful end would be duly reached.  When we met on the following evening, his face was  lighted up with an expression of exhilaration. I know my own countenance must always have betrayed the  pleasure I felt at meeting him. In those happy days I had never known any reason for concealing my feel-  ings. As he approached me, on this occasion, he took unusual notice of my joyful look; and his own seemed to grow brighter and gladder, as if reflecting the light of happiness upon which he gazed. "However the future may serve us, Cora, no one can doubt the present. There is more love in your   IN THE RAPIDS.        9 candid eyes, this moment, than would satisfy the most exacting heart. You must own that, while you ac- knowledge by every word and action that it is all mine, I did not win any of it by the shallow flattery which captivates so many of you poor children. But will you not let me say that you look beautiful to- day?-not through the mere combination of certain lines, nor by the presence of certain colors; for, even if these were wanting, no matter what the discords of hue or shape, the love which animates and exalts you would always bestow that harmony which is the secret of all beauty. Without it, humanity is like an instru- ment out of tune and untouched by the master-hand that understands and controls its power. All of us can be charmed by the melody which starts into life at the touch of that hand; but, as there is a deeper, richer meaning and joy in it for the attuned and educated ear, so there is an especial beauty in us all to the eye of one who loves us, which even Time, who spoils so many things, cannot impair. When disease has dimmed the eye and paled the cheek, or death himself has laid his icy hand upon the heart that beats responsive to our own, there is beauty still left for the eye of affection. But let this perish, and we are as deaf to the music of 'the laugh, and as blind to the sweetness of the smile, as if they came in mockery from some gibbering ghost. "But, Cora, while I can see the beauty which comes of love, there is something yet that love should bring, of which I must have your assurance.' He paused, and searched my countenance severely, as though he were endeavoring to discover if I divined    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6869-00000031"/> 60    IN THE RAPIDS. what he was about to say, or were anticipating an ex- pression in harmony with the answer he appeared to hope I would give, or, again, as if he were preparing himself to detect any departure from sincerity in that answer. He found nothing, I am sure, but excited curiosity. I could only say,- "What can you ask, Laurence, that I have not already granted?" "Have you courage, Cora? Love gives courage," he said, slowly. "I have courage," I answered, "for anything which will make us-make you-happy." "You have evidently been carefully, tenderly nur- tured. You have probably never known the want of anything which money could procure. Privation may attend your steps as soon as you start on the pathway of life with me. Could you cheerfully undergo the trial?" "I shall never complain," I answered. He continued: "You know but little of me. I may be a mere adventurer, drifting about the world, without a fixed habitation, and possibly with a name which, in becoming yours, may disgrace you. Cer- tainly the man in whose society you first encountered me is not one to inspire respect for his companions. Your handsome friend,-but no matter; his face is enough. Well, Cora, is there nothing in what I have said of myself, in the truth that may be in it, to shake  your courage?" "Tell me, Laurence," I replied, "that it is so, and   IN THE RAPIDS.        6 "As to that, all I have pictured may be purely imaginary. The question is, Has every consideration of parental displeasure, of social reputation, of imperilled honor, of personal safety even, so far yielded to your regard for me that you are willing to trust yourself implicitly to my guidance, to leave this place at any hour, on any day, I may name?" He paused. Expecting him to proceed, I remained silent. He had awakened thoughts which were new to me as to what I had done or might be asked to do. As I am writing what I mean shall be a true record, I am compelled to confess that, if he had not proceeded, I would have answered him affirmatively. But he added,--  "--provided I promise you that the first roof under which we pass together shall be that of a church?" I answered, promptly and firmly, "I am willing; and at any moment." "Then to-morrow be it. At this hour I will be here. Now good-night. f This is, I hope, our last parting." If there is such a thing as driving from one's mind all thought of so perilous a step as the one I was. about to take, I did it now. There was at the first instant after his departure a sudden rush through my brain of every imaginable consideration which might induce me to stop short in this undertaking; and the next moment I felt as though it were all over, the step irrevocably taken, and further reflection useless. I succeeded in supporting this frame of mind by the exercise of more self-control than I had ever before 6    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6869-00000032"/> 62       IN THE RAPIDS. given myself credit for. True, I had to choose be- tween that and a conflict of ideas which I knew I could not encounter without bringing on a nervous condition that might betray to his eyes a want of courage or confidence. Mere child as I may say I was, I clearly saw that any such manifestation would be fatal. Meanwhile, my stay at the school had been pro- tracted in pertinacious disregard of my parents' wishes. At the expiration of the first two or three days which I had solicited at the instance of Kate Rosmond, I wrote, begging for a week more. When that was passed, I wrote again. I was answered that at the end of the period then designated my father was coming to the city on business, and would call and take me home. I waited his coming with a feeling of despair. The day arrived, and instead of him came a letter from my mother, announcing his sudden illness and com- manding my immediate return. I wrote again, begging for yet a day or two, assigning I know not what reason for my wish to remain. No more letters came for me, though several, post-marked as mine were, came addressed to the principal, but which, in her still-continued absence, remained unopened. I was prepared to see my father or mother, or some messenger from them, at any moment at the door. I simply shut my eyes to the probable result of such a isit. A change had come over the intercourse which had existed between Kate and myself. After my second or third interview with Laurence, he always came into   IN THE RAPIDS.        63 the playground, remaining with me in the gravelled walk between the hedge of box-trees and the rear wall. Kate, on the contrary, invariably went out by the gate. We returned to the house and to our rooms usually together; but whatever she might have to say about the proceedings I have described was always in the form of most disagreeable raillery, interspersed after awhile with ill-natured remarks about my com- panion, prompted, I have now reason to believe, by hers. I am sure that my imprudence had the effect to exalt rather than to debase my ideas of good taste and refinement of feeling. I am equally certain that the opposite was the case with her. Points of differ- ence in our respective characters were thus developed, which, to a certain extent, estranged us. By tacit ,consent, we ceased to converse on any but the most trivial subjects. On the evening following my last conversation with Laurence, he did not make his appearance until a few moments before my usual time for retiring. Provided with the coarse shawl which the school regulations prescribed for the use of all the scholars, and with a Quaker straw bonnet, which I crushed out of shape in my endeavors to conceal it beneath the shawl, I had patiently awaited his coming. 'He took my hand without a word, and we passed 'into the street. A carriage was on the opposite side of the way, the in- closed square grass-plot; previously mentioned, inter- vening. It was an ominously disagreeable evening, and few persons were passing. Kate and Mr. Etheridge were,    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6869-00000033"/> "      IN THE RAPIDS. at the time, at the farther end of the square, coming towards us; and, though we could not distinguish their faces, we recognized their forms. As we were  crossing the street, and about to pass behind the, iron  railing of the square, I turned instinctively to look at s them. They, too, were crossing at the lower end of  the square. We entered the carriage, Laurence speak- ing a few words in a low tone to the coachman, and  were driven at a gentle pace away. Mr. Etheridge  and Kate were now standing directly in our course, and peered eagerly in at us. At the end of a drive of perhaps fifteen minutes, we stopped before a church. As we descended from the carriage, a small door on the right of the great central portal was opened, and  we entered. Laurence and I had not spoken to each other. I followed what appeared to be his intentions by merely observing his motions. His taking my hand and gently pressing it when we first met is the only sign I can remember that he made. As this fit of taciturnity was not an unusual condition with him, and as I had always refrained from breaking in upon  his reveries, I took but little notice of it now.  "Is the clergyman here?" he inquired of the man  at the door. "He is, sir. You will please step this way." Obeying his directions, we passed up the aisle lead- ing from the door by which we had entered. The church was either a new one, not quite finished, or was undergoing repairs. We had to pass under scaf- folds, erected across the aisle, scarcely high enough to admit of our walking erect. The floor was covered   IN THE RAPIDS.       65 with chips and shavings, and a strong odor of paint  pervaded the atmosphere of the place. A single lamp, suspended from the ceiling by a chain, afforded the only light, and this was just over the railing at the far- ther end, towards which we groped, stumbling at every step over the rubbish in our path. The place felt damp and chilly, and there was a general air of dis- ' comfort and gloom about it, which shook my nerves more than anything that had yet happened. Just as we reached the railing, a door in the vestry- room opened, and a clergyman came forth, wearing a white surplice, and bearing a candle in one hand and a book in the other. He regarded me with a stern, cold look as he approached. Laurence handed him a paper, which he examined with a most annoying delib- erateness. My self-command had up to this point been perfect, but I felt that any unnecessary delay would be fatal to it. The vault-like feeling of the place in- creased. A pinching pain attacked my heart, and I had to strain every muscle to repress an increasing disposition to shiver. I dared not anticipate, in thought, a single moment of the ceremony about to take place. I endeavored to forget that it concerned me at all! I tried to rivet my attention upon the most trifling objects, the length of the candle in the clergyman's hand, the size of his book, the color of his hair and of his eyes, and other matters equally trivial and irrelevant. The examination of the paper concluded, conversa- tion took place between the clergyman and Laurence in reference to the presence of witnesses, but to which 6*    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6869-00000034"/> "      IN THE RAPIDS. I was resolutely deaf, for it indicated some probable obstruction. Seemingly satisfied on the point dis- cussed, the clergyman proceeded with the ceremony, reading from his book in a loud, strained pitch of voice. I could withhold my attention no longer. With a sudden rebound my mind turned to contemplate the nature of the rite about to be performed. A sense of joy at the impending consummation of the great hope of my heart dominated over thoughts of home and parents, over fears, too, of future retributive suffering, but did not silence them. Whether of joy or dread,- whether springing from a feeling of happiness that would have vent, or from a conflict of that feeling with stubborn thoughts which were not happy,-or possibly from a physical yielding to the discomfort of the cold- n2ss and the gloom,-perhaps even had the harsh tone been wanting to the clergyman's voice they might not have come,-but they did come,-with Laurence's look bent upon me, as I felt, though I could not see it, came the dreaded, long-resisted tears to my eyes and down my face, in a flood which told how long it had been pent up. "Stop, sir!" cried Laurence to the clergyman, in a voice which sounded like thunder in my ears. This ceremony must not proceed! The woman I marry must have no regrets!" At this astounding interruption I lost all self-con- trol. Continued tears and convulsive sobs choked my utterance, and, after a vain and painful struggle to call Laurence's name, I sank down, completely over- come. One moment my heart beat as though it   IN THE RAPIDS.       67 would burst from my bosom, the next it stood still. I gasped for breath, and was fast becoming unconscious, when I felt myself caught up in Laurence's arms and borne out of the church. A few moments in the open air revived me, and I made my way to the carriage, this time in advance of my companion, and entered as best I could without his assistance, which I no longer desired, exclaim- ing,-- "For God's sake, take, me back." "Drive to where you took us up," said he to the coachman, "and quickly." And he got in, taking a seat, not beside, but opposite me.  *Crouching in a corner of the carriage, I drew my shawl over my head and face, so as to shut out every sight and sound, and to veil and muffle my incessant weeping and sobbing from the eyes and ears of mny companion. We moved rapidly along, and in a few moments stopped. Uncovering my face, I beheld the school-wall, and the gate open as I had left it. Laurence descended and stood ready to assist me. But I sprang out and ran past him, through the gate across the grounds, and into the porch of the school- house. I stopped an instant to recqver my breath, and had time to perceive that Miss Carey's light was still burning. I must pass her door to get to my room, and had always to call and say good-night, that she might know we were retiring seasonably. Kate had always, until now, accompanied me; but as she never, on any occasion, expended an unnecessary word on any matter of mere ceremony, only my voice    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6869-00000035"/> 68       IN THE RAPIDS. was heard, and, unless the teacher-happened to look up from hei: writing, which she seldom did, Kate might have been absent without detection. I tapped at the door, and, scarcely glancing in, made the customary salutation in the firmest tone I could command, and then hastened to my room. Oh, how hard it was to realize the events of the last hour! I felt, while in the church, that I had been there long enough to grow old, and now that I was back in my room the time that had elapsed since I left it appeared too short for the events that had been crowded into it. For awhile I half persuaded myself, as I lay on my bed, that I had just awakened from a dream. But, alas! there was no dreaming, for sleep had become impossible. My aching head tossed on the uneasy pillow the long, long, weary night, and I could not even close my eyes. A blistering flame seemed to burn before them, turning wherever they turned. I heard the city clock toll out each tedious hour, and the sound penetrated to my brain in multi- tudinous vibrations and with a keen distinctness, as if I had a thousand ears. How I prayed for that night of torture to be gone, and, when it did pass, how wel- come to my straining eyes were the first gray lines of dawn that crept through the curtains! With them came the longed-for slumber. I fell into a deep, lethargic sleep, from which I was hardly aroused by: the loud breakfast-bell. ,s On descending, I found-the principal had just re- turned, and was taking Miss Carey to tasl-about the "H,hk *"n"' /"nf4  no :s m,'no ^"A  hazy,:r. l^M A  r..v"   IN THE RAPIDS.       69 open by him. Miss Carey could not remember having parted with the key, and she appealed to me; but I had not even asked myself why I had found the nate open on my return, or where Kate was at that time. Atten- tion being directed to me by this question, my haggard appearance did not escape comment. "My dear child," exclaimed the principal, "I thought you were to have gone home. Have you been ill in my absence? or what is the matter? You look very badly." Miss Carey, relieved for the moment by this diver- sion, also noticed my pallor and dejection; and her 'trouble evidently increased as she seemed to divine some connection between my appearance and the un- locked gate. At this instant a servant entered, her face all astare with the alarming intelligence that Miss Rosmond was nowhere to be found. We were struck dumb by this announcement; the principal looked alternately at me and Miss Carey, whose trouble was at its climax, her confusion and alarm painful to behold. Before a word was spoken, the hall door-bell rang, and, as it was an unusual hour for visitors, we awaited the approaching footsteps with the assurance that they betokened information concerning the miss- 1  ing scholar. But we were disappointed; it was my parents who were ushered into the room, and, as I --knew they were to be expected at any moment, I was by no means surprised. My mother received my ex- cited embraces with her usual dignity and composure, manifesting, then at least, no displeasure at my lack of obedience. My father, who bore the marks of his    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6869-00000036"/> 70       IN THE RAPIDS. recent severe illness and was in no gentle mood after the journey he had to make, saluted me very curtly. The principal engaged them at once in conversation, during which I watched for an opportunity to with- ' draw. As inquiry into my own conduct would impli-  cate me to some extent in Kate's disappearance, I had  resolved to answer no questions, except privately to  my mother; for, as I had never concealed anything J from her, I felt that to do so now would but increase  the burden of my sorrow, while confession might per-  haps lighten it. I was soon summoned to the drawing-room, for the  purpose, as I had expected, of being questioned, and, declining to answer, I was threatened with dismissal. To this threat my mother gravely replied that I was less guilty than those to whose care I had been in- trusted, and that, far from desiring that I should re- main, no inducement could persuade her to permit it. My trunks were immediately packed, and we started X for home, delaying only for breakfast at the hotel.   CHAPTER    VI. (OUR trip homeward waS gloomy in the extreme. My mother made no allusion to my haggard and dejected appearance, but her efforts to appear cheerful were in painful contrast with the anxiety she evidently felt. My thoughts gradually wandered from her, to fix themselves upon my recent strange and un- fortunate adventure; and there was nothing in the contemplation from which to gather a single hopeful anticipation. My future life was depicted only as a succession of dreary and wearisome years, whether few or many, without plan or purpose, during which the burden of existence would grow heavier day by day. This was an extreme 'and a strange view for one so young; but it serves to show how firm a hold had been taken upon my heart by the feelings so recently implanted there. While I knew that to forget was my only hope of peace, I clung to the memory of my sorrow with an infatuation that made it the next most precious thing to the realization of the wild dream of happiness in which I had so recently indulged. Be- yond these gloomy ideas, I was conscious only of absolute indifference to everything. A sort of torpor crept over my mind; persons and .objects passed before me, but left no impression whatever. Whether we stopped or went on, whether we travelled slowly or (7)    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6869-00000037"/> i 72       LAV TIEE RAPIDS. rapidly, I cared not: I should be the same at the end as at the beginning of the journey. A change of any kind was disagreeable, because some mental effort was required to realize the fact of a change; and even the involuntary operations of my mind had become irk- some. I coveted the seductive and fatal sleep of the snow-bound Alpine traveller. Arrived. at home, the familiar sights and sounds usually so sweet to every returned wanderer, only made me aware how much I must have changed to be no longer capable of enjoying them. Fcor weeks I did not pass out of the shadow of the house, and in no respect were my former home habits resumed, except in the conversations and readings with my mother. I found it no longer possible to take the same interest in them; but the engaging sweetness of the voice to whose tones I had been so long accustomed lulled me more nearly into forgetfulness than any other of- the whilom pleasant things that had once made home so happy. I could not be insensible to the efforts my mother made to win me back to the old currents of thought, and I strove by mere force of gratitude and filial affection to show that I appreciated them. My dear mother's countenance would brighten up when- ever my attention appeared to be engaged by any sub- ject she was discoursing upon; but when I fell back into the gloomy reveries that had become the habit of my mind, a sorrowful quivering and faltering in her tones would recall me to myself, at times, to see the tears trickling down her face. Tempted after awhile into an occasional stroll or   ride, I found some relief in bodily exercise, always preferring to be alone, and shunning altogether the localities that excited recollections of childhood. Au- tumn, with its sombre suggestions of change and decay, had come; the fallen and falling leaves, and the melancholy piping of the wind among tie trees, made the woods a resort entirely in consonance with my own desolation. With a restless longing to wander as far away from the house as possible, I chose for the most part to pursue these rambles on horseback, which made me quite an adept in riding. Owing, to the peculiar situation of that portion of the woods which I most frequented, I was in no danger of en- countering any one; and, the fear of accidents, which at first gave my mother uneasiness, was soon dispelled by the skill I acquired in managing my horse. Thanks to this exercise, my health suffered less than it other- wise would have done; and this consideration, no doubt, more than any other, prevented interference with my selfish conduct. But, as I had grown prematurely old in feeling, my powers of perception too were morbidly quickened, and I soon observed that the entire household was more or less overshadowed by the gloom which had settled upon me. Leaving home a mere child in thought and action, and conscious of no controlling influence over any one, I did not at first suspect, and assuredly did not desire to exercise, my present power of spreading the wretchedness in which I returned to it; like a contagion, among all around me. Once clearly understanding that, however, I determined to make an i 7     <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6869-00000038"/> r4 '    JIN THE RAPIDS. effort at reparation. It would seem that we are so much accustomed, from the dawn of memory,'to the self-sacrificing devotion of a mother, that we put her to grief and keep up the cause of her affliction at times when better judgment, if not filial affection, should impel us to lighten rather than to increase her burdens. That such inexcusable selfishness undoubtedly in- A creases our hold on her affection proves that there must be some explanation in nature for it; but, what- ever that may be, it is true that I indulged my culpable waywardness, and made a heartless display of my overwhelming grief, so long as only my good mother appeared to suffer in sympathy with me;' while my first conviction of the necessity of being more reason- able was derived from the dismal faces of the servants and workmen about the place. iA?   The confession I had intended to make my mother Siz  was up to this time unspoken, and I now concluded to make it the first step towards reformation in my habits. The unusually cheerful countenance with which I ap- proached her induced her to anticipate me in opening the subject. ;-   "Cora, my child, I have observed that you have been fretting ever since you came from school. I have refrained from speaking to you about it, because in- dulgent sympathy would have tended to confirm the , morbid condition of your mind; and to have expressed disapproval of the conduct of which I fear you have been guilty, was more than I could nerve myself to do while you were suffering so much. It was your first   fIV TIIE RAPIDS.       75 fault, and you are now safe, I hope, from a repetition of it. You shall never leave me again." r  - "Do you know, mother, what has happened?  I was about to tell you all, and shall,;indeed, be sur- ,prised if the information already in your possession renders the revelation unnecessary." "I learned enough on the morning of my visit to the school, Cora, to satisfy me that you and your missing schoolmate had means of egress from the premises; and no loving, thoughtful mother would fail to recognize in such demeanor as yours the exist- ence of,feelings that at your age, at least, do not come of themselves, nor from such associations as those to which I hoped I had restricted you. I feel so deeply grateful that you did not follow in the footsteps of your companion, that I must forgive the error you did commit,-thankful thatyou stopped short of another, which would have brought life-long misery upon your parents."  "Mother, I have been guiltier than you think- " "Of what, my child? of what?" she exclaimed. You are not married? She had suddenly become very pale, and was trem- bli'ngI "No, dear mother," I hastened to assure her, I am not; but read this, and you will learn how little I am to be praised for--for what you will consider my escape." I drew from my bosom my record of Laurence's con- versations, which now included the scene at the church, and I had also appended what I could remem-    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6869-00000039"/> - 76    IN THE RAPIDS. 76  ber of my own words in reply to him at various times. I gave it to my mother, saying, "You can learn mnore from this than I have the courage to tell you. It may show you, also, how to bear with me in the future." On the following morning, when I joined her in her accustomed ramble in her private garden, she handed me back the book, saying,- "I am at a loss, my child, what to make of the sin- gular being who has so deeply impressed you. He might have acted less honorably than he did; and, after reading these conversations, I am not surprised that he has taken a powerful hold on your imagi- nation. I will not chide you for the resolution you have formed in regard to him; but I must warn you that indulgence in such fancies is not the wisest preparation for the realities of life, in which you must expect sooner or later to take part. I blame myself for having confined you so long to the society of your father and myself Your quiet, solitary life, removed ^- -from all contact with the outside world, has made you too susceptible. Your school life should have com- menced earlier; but, as I cannot think now of any further attempt to repair that mistake, I have been reflecting upon the propriety of obtaining some one to fill the position, ostensibly of governess, but really of companion for you,-some one of elevated morals, good taste, and refined manners, whose knowledge of the world would correct your deficiencies. Were I still young enough to constitute you an example, there are few who could bring the recommendation of larger   IN THE' RAPIDS.       7 sively devoted to books, that, while I have accumu- lated a vast store of theoretic wisdom, I am practically far behind the age. It is my wish that we should re- move to the city; but your father insists that there is an insuperable obstacle to our doing so. How would you like the society of such a person in the capacity of governess, Cora?" X /"My dear mother,"' I said, "I have never yet felt the want of society here; but you lay so much stress on the necessity of preparing me for associations of a different kind, that I will offer no objection to any arrangements you may think proper to make to that end. The plan presents at least some prospect of diverting me from the subject which has caused you so much uneasiness." "Well, my child," she rejoined, gratified by my ac- quiescence, you have been so much given to solitude of late that I feared company of any kind would be distasteful to you; and, as your intense sisceptibility inherited from me has been so much increased by my imprudent mode of educating you, it was necessary first to consult you, in order to spare you any needless irritation. I am happy to find that you agree with me as to the expediency of the proposed arrangement. "Shortly after your return I received a letter from your late principal, apologizing for her brusque manner -on the occasion of my visit, and offering an explanation l ithe loose mode in which discipline was administered during her absence. It was indited in so candid and i generous a spirit that I could not do otherwise than reply to it, and I made use of the opportunity to in- "         A*    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6869-00000040"/> 78       IN THE RAPIDS. quire for such a governess as I have had in my mind. She answered promptly, recommending a former pupil, -now a widow, with one child about six years old.  The child may be an objection, but it is also possible  that it may be an agreeable addition to our household;  and, in a spirit of charity, let us hope so. The lady is  described as competent and deserving, and, as your father is quite willing to receive her, I will write to the  city to-day." Several letters were interchanged, and finally one came from Mrs. Victor (for such was the widow's name) appointing a day in the following month when  we might look for her arrival. I was now not easily  excited on any subject, and I awaited the expected  visitor with scarcely a sensation of curiosity, but, thinking to give her a cheerful impression of her new  home, I proposed to meet her at the station.  "By no means," said my mother. "There is nothing more difficult than to keep within their proper sphere personswho are compelled by misfortune to descend  to a subordinate position. The slightest act of un- necessary civility might give her such erroneous ini-  pressions as would unfit her for her place, and do her  as well as ourselves an injury, unless she is gifted with  an extraordinary fund of common sense; and common sense is not sown broadcast. I will see, however, that the carriage meets her at the station." When Mrs. Victor arrived, she was shown into my mother's private library, and I was sent for an hour later. Expecting to see a person rendered disconsolate by the recent loss of her husband, I was prepared to   IN THE RAPIDS.         79 assuie an expression of sympathy with her presumed affliction. Iut I perceived the moment I entered the room that I inight spare myself all show of sorrow on her account. I looked in vain for any marks of widowhood in the person to whom I was presented; there was no token of it in her dress, nor did her countenance present the slightest trace of sorrow. She was small, yet lithe and graceful; her features were of, ordinary cast, except her large and brilliant light-gray eyes, which imparted to her otherwise in- expressive countenance great animation. She was volublei in conversation, quite self-possessed, and seemed entirely to ignore that our intercourse might be affected by the fact of her subordinate position. I was gratified at this trait, for it indicated an independ- ence of character which promised me more pleasure and profit from her society than I should have other- wise looked for. I remembered my mother's sensi- tiveness on this point, however; and, as I had already become prepossessed in favor of the governess, I began to fear that they would not come to terms, from the exhibition on Mrs. Victor's part of those characteristics which most pleased me, and from evidences on my mother's that they were not desirable. The little I had to say, then, during the interview, was in favor of the governess; and it is possible that that little decided the matter. It will: appear hereafter tLat this woman possessed other less admirable qualities than those which so agreeably affected me, and that it would have been of incalculable advantage to me if she had not been en I  .  -                   .    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6869-00000041"/> 80       IN THE RAPIDS. gaged. How often are we thus led by some unac- countable caprice, or by the desire to achieve some comparatively insignificant purpose, to do the one thing which shall bring down upon us an impending  misfortune! I have mentioned that we were rarely disturbed by visitors, except my father's tenants, or others having business with him, and these of course did not remain a single unnecessary moment. Latterly, however, the desirable position of our property had attracted, I was told, the attention of wealthy speculators in the city, and I sometimes encountered one of these rare visitors  in the grounds or in the course of my frequent rides  through the woods. Whenever it happened that their stay lasted beyond any meal-hour, I absented myself from the table; for since I had lost Laurence the society of gentlemen, always embarrassing to me, became altogether distasteful. Not so with Mrs. Victor. She made it a point to take part in entertain- ing them, soliciting the while my care for her boy, whose very existence on such occasions she appeared studiously t conceal. Returning one afternoon from the solitary ride which was till my daily habit, devoting that much time to my pleasant, mournful memories, I met little Paul about a mile from the house. It was a cool day, but the little fellow was comfortably wrapped, and his fat cheeks were rosy with the fresh air and exercise for which he had so recently exchanged the close city atmosphere. He ran up to me as I approached, and said,-   IN THE RAPIDS.        8  Mamma's with two gentlemen, and sent me to you. She saw you coming." I dismounted, and, taking his hand, continued home-* ward afoot, after fastening the reins in the stirrup and leaving my horse to his own guidance. That docile creature, accustomed to be thus dismissed to be re- called at pleasure during my rambles, trotted forward a short distance and then returned; going as far behind us and following for awhile in a quiet walk, he would again start forward and again return, keeping always within sound of my voice. His playful movements delighted my boy companion, and kept him in con- tinued merry laughter. Happy sounds do not always awake consonant echoes in the mind. Probably all who are inclined by temperament or untoward fortune to regard human life in its darker aspects, are led rather into sad than pleas- ant reflections by gleeful laughter'or joyous music. A stray note borne on a passing breeze from a distant festive throng will sometimes come to the solitary listener burdened with the gloom of all the care and sorrow which their feasting and dance and song have driven for the time away. So the childish joy of the little prattler at my side was the signal in me for an almost solemn train of speculation as to the bright or gloomy possibilities of his future. Endowed with special grace to cast out the leaven of original sin within him, was he to be the joy of his widowed mother's heart, her pride in his youth, her protection and support in manhood, keeping wrinkles from her brow, tears from her eyes, and making pleasant her    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6869-00000042"/> 82       IN THE RAPIDS. going on the downward slope of life? Or would he live to be the shame of her who bore him, and make her wish that the sod had lain cold on her bosom ere it nurtured him? The child, the music of whose laughter and merry prattle led to these reflections, interrupted them by tugging repeatedly at my dress, and when he had gained my attention he said,- "I love you; I want to kiss you." I stooped down to gratify both him and myself, and, as he was about to put his arms around my neck, I asked him,- "Why do you love me? What do you want to kiss me for?" "Mamma said you were going to give me a ride on your horse." It happened that we had just reached the wide gravelled walk that formed the boundary of the grounds, and it was the point at which my horse, when at liberty, was accustomed to take his departure for the stables. He had already set off in a rapid can- ter, and was too far away to be recalled, consequently i I had to tell the child I could not gratify him. Never- theless, I waited for the kiss; but, instead, a flash of anger shot from his eyes, and he planted his little fists with two sharp blows in quick succession in my face, and, in the posture I had assumed to receive his caress, I was scarcely able to retain my balance. Before I could recover myself to seize him, he had scampered away, turning, however, two or three times in his re- treat, to pelt me with small stones. After the first vexation, I was more amused than angered by his be-   IN THE RAPIDS.        83 havioiand sufficiently indignant with his mother for her deception which had led to it, not to inform upon him; but I felt assured that her punishment would inevitably come in the earlier development pf hi3 vin- dictive nature. To avoid the gentlemen, whose voices reached me from the front of the house, I made my way by a circuitous route to the apartment I had used as a study since Mrs. Victor's arrival, and set to work on a sketch that I was copying under her instructions. Drawing was one of the most agreeable of my studies, and I continued pencilling until the early autumn twilight darkened the Iroom too much for me to proceed. As I was quitting the apartment, I passed the windows, and observed my father crossing the lawn in conver- sation with a man whose short, spare figure was so out of proportion to his immense head that he seemed on the verge of toppling over every moment. He had an ungainly stooD in the shoulders, one of which was much higher than the other., His hands were buried in the pockets of his coat,:and he kept flapping the tails of that garment as if he would assist his legs by propulsive power in maintaining the forward motion of his body. As they passed out of sight, Mrs. Victor appeared with a companion,-a gentleman of tall, full figure, most elegantly, not to say foppishy; attired; there was a little more than a woman likes to see, in a man, of devotion to the toilet, in the perfect fit of his gloves, the exquisite polish of his boots, the precise set of his hat, and the almost effeminate nicety with which his luxuriant and curly    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6869-00000043"/> 84       IN THE RAPIDS. hair was arranged. His face I could not clearly discern, as it was partially turned from me, but there was enough in what was visible of the proportions of his head, and especially in the graceful conformation of the back  of it, to promise a well-shaped, if not a handsome, face. Without denying Mrs. Victor full credit for the emi- nent freedom of her colloquial powers, I could yet not imagine that the familiar and vivacious style of her ex- pression and gesture was possible in a first interview. j   CHAPTER    VII. TpHE morning of the succeeding day passed with- out any allusion being made to the occurrences just mentioned, it being a rule which I must do Mrs. Victor the credit to say she strictly observed, to con- fine my attention and her own, during the time set aside for the purpose, to those studies in which her assistance was ostensibly required; and it is equally just to say that it was only in that respect that she was of service, for it was soon apparent that neither her talents nor acquirements where of a high order. But it was only under the restraint of rule or hab't that she was thus reticent on this occasion, for it was easy to see that something was on her mind of which she wished to disburden it. Since Mrs. Victor's in- stallation, my mother indulged daily in an afternoon' nap, rendered necessary by an increasing constitutional weakness, and which she now the more readily per- mitted herself, as she was able to relax her attention to me. A drizzling rain set in after dinner, and changed towards evening to a sleet. Everything out of doors had a dismally uncomfortable appearance, and with one accord the governess and myself repaired to the snug little study-room, with its closely-drawn curtains and cheerful hickory fire. I determined not only to give Mrs. Victor an oppor- 8       (85)    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6869-00000044"/> 86       IN THE RAPIDS. tunity to talk, but to compel her, in a manner, to do so, by keeping entire silence and by refraining from doing anything which could in any way engage her atten-  tion. I placed a chair against one side of the mantel and took my seat. She sat, facing the fire, with her feet upon the fender, her countenance being in the full light, while I was in the rapidly deepening shadow. She remained silent awhile, twirling a pencil, and  gazing into the fire with that peculiar gleaming stare which shows the mind to be occupied with other, things than what the eyes rest upon. A half-formed smile occasionally crept over her face, filling up its not unhandsome outlines, to be chased away by the shadow of some unpleasant thought which gave tem-  porarily a sharp, melancholy castto her features, pro-  ducing the effect of alternating sunlight and cloud on a landscape.  "Heigh ho! Miss Darwin," she began, "isn't this a dismal day? Hear the rain and sleet beating against - the windows. I've been thinking of old times, and this is a nice occasion to talk about them. You seem to  have led so quiet and monotonous a life, that one day has always been pretty much like another with you, I have no doubt. What a pity you do not inove into the city! But, by the way, I do not think you can. That little gentleman who was here yesterday is a lawyer, and seems to know more about the place than your father. He made the old gentleman as mad as a hornet. He told him he had only a life-estate in it, and was bound to reside here. It's a pity; for you have no idea what a glorious, gay life it is. My ex-   IN THE R APIDS.       87 istence was a perfect round of pleasure until Julius's death,-that's Mr. Victor, my late husband. You saw that other gentleman? I mean the handsome one. Did not see his face? What a pity! Oh, but he has a ravishing countenance! The sight of him and our little chit-chat revived old days. I was happy and wretched all at once.' I did not know, scarcely, if I should laugh or cry. My! my! but he's handsome! I was a little surprised at his meeting me so cordially; for, if he remembers as much as I do, he must be a queer kind,of a man if he does not feel a good deal of resentment. But he talked, however, as if he thought it charitable to win me into a little forgetfulness for an hour, as a relief to the distress which he rightfully con- jectured I am in from the loss of my husband: that is, as if it were out of pity. How I hate anything like that! I always like to do my own crying. Love born of pity is of the namby-pamby, milk-and-water kind, and is not to be relied on any more than that quasi- passion which sets a man to writing love-letters, cudgelling his brains, ransacking dictionaries and books of synonyms, and otherwise laboring and wor- rying to concoct smoothly-flowing sentences and mould sonorous and well-rounded periods, wasting a day in inditing a dozen pages, which read as if they had been dashed off in ten minutes and written on the thinnest procurable paper to save postage. Never trust to anything of the sort. The man whose love is attended with so much use of pen and ink has only a fanciful affection, and if ever it reaches the point of matrimony-and it generally does not-he finds he 1    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6869-00000045"/> 88       IN THE RAPIDS.  has been enraptured with an idea, and the woman he marries must be a miracle if she proves to be the em- bodiment of it. Of course you have never been in love, because you have had no opportunity in this out-of- the-way place; but you may not be always so, and my advice on this point will be worth remembering. I would not suffer any such nonsense, pleasant as it is, from the best man in other respects that ever, lived. Not that I ever think of marrying again; but Willis- Mr. Baxter is a splendid match, and he is an old friend, and I would like so much for him to find a wife after my own heart. He seems to have some idea of  settling in this neighborhood, or, at least, of purchas- ing property hereabouts. He came down to look at this place, but that little, dried-up old lawyer advised him against it.  "I first met Mr. Baxter in the steamer coming from Europe. You know I spent the last few years of my girlhood in Italy, on account of ma's health. She died there of consumption. I think I told you before, didn't I? Well, I declare, I thought I had! My father and his were old friends, and we soon became intimate; and I do believe that if the voyage had lasted another week it would have been a match. There were two other girls from the city on board, young and pretty, but I carried it over all, notwith- standing the lively competition excited by his hand- some person and delightful manners. Business called him away from the city immediately on his arrival, and we did not meet again for a long while,-in fact, not until I had made a conquest of Julius. He, you must   IN THE RAPIDS.        89 know, loved me desperately from the first day we met. But he was probably the most difficult man to bring to the point that any woman had ever to deal with. He would say all manner of sweet, pretty things. He was most devoted in his attentions, and there was no misunderstanding the earnestness of his affection, only that it was too much in the platonic style to suit my practical turn of mind; and the necessity of being es- pecially practical just then was very palpable from the look of things about home. There was some trouble brewing, evidently. Pa was wearing an anxious face. I had endeavored to take ma's place in domestic matters, and thought it proper to make some effort to ascertain the nature of the threatening trouble, in order to assist in warding it off, or to prepare to meet it. Pa would give me no satisfaction, but, said he, 'If Mr. Victor means business, it's high time he was about it.' Rather a rough way of handling the subject, wasn't it? But, you know, the best of men have their peculiarities; anyhow, I understood that there was some good reason for shortening the already too-protracted courtship. I suspected financial trouble was at the bottom of it. Now, a great mlany young girls in my situation, ro- mantically disposed, and suspecting what I did, would have waited until the storm burst upon them, in order to try the strength of the dear one's regard, all of which is very well in its way, and may end by the generous man coming promptly to the rescue, ready to do his part towards the consummation of your wishes and his own,-to bind himself to protect, love, cherish,--in fact, take general charge of you until 8*      <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6869-00000046"/> 90       IV THE RAPIDS. death you two do part, and so forth, to the end of the  chapter. On the other hand, the generous may be altogether sunk in the cautious man, who, while he adheres to the text of his love-discourses, varies won- derfully his commentary, and astonishes you by the ingenuity with which he endeavors to prove how gen- erous he is in giving you an opportunity to find a hus- band in somebody else. "Now, what's the use of exposing yourself to any such alternative? Once the opportunity is yours, take advantage of it. It's very sentimental, and so on, to say you had rather know the interested nature of a man's motives before than after marriage; but don't you see that if he is the kind of man that would cling to you in bad as well as in good fortune, it is all right any- how, and if he is the other kind, why, he is as likely as not to make a cautious, prudent husband, and to take good care of you? I would not have a man who did not look ahead a little. "Well, as I was saying about Julius,-that's Mr. Vic- tor, my late husband,-after understanding pa's view of the case, I concluded to adopt it; and an opportu- nity occurred through Mr. Baxter, in this way. Now, this is all in confidence, you know, but I am sure I can trust you with anything. One evening, soon after pa made that observation, we-that's Paul and myself- were with a small party at a friend's, and who should come in but Willis?-that's Mr. Baxter. I declare, I was so delighted to see him, and he appeared so pleased to see me, and we talked so long together about the de- lightful trip across from Europe, after ma's death in    IN TILE RAPIDS.       9 Italy, where she went, as I told you, on account of her health,-she had consumption,--that we, or I, at least, forgot that there was anybody else in the room; but, happening to look around, I saw that Julius was terri- bly put out. If ever a man was jealous, he was. I like a man to be a little so. If you have any sense at all, you can do what you please with him. Seeing, then, the effect of my unpremeditated tete-a-tete with Willis, I determined to make the most of the circumstances, and continued to pay him marked attention. Julius hadt a fine voice, and some one prevailed on him to sing,--I say prevailed, but I can't think he was very reluctant, for Willis and myself were sitting very close to the piano, and when Julius sat down to it, instead of one of the sweet, gentle, sentimental songs of which he knew a thousand, and which he was incessantly singing to me, he attempted 'The Maniac,' then just out. He did not sing; he bellowed as if he had made up his mind to drown- all conversation, and that of Willis and myself especially; and, sitting as close to him as we were, we could not hear our ears, as they say. He roared so, and thundered upon the keys, and stretched out the wretched song until I thought he would deafen us, and that it would never come to an end; and he shrieking, 'I am not mad! I am not mad!' when all the time he was as furious as a fam- ished tiger. Ha! ha! ha! It almost threw me into convulsions to keep from laughing; and he was staring me right in the face all the time, as I was sitting at the end of the piano. Ha! ha! ha! I can't help laugh- ing every time I think of it. He wanted to try another    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6869-00000047"/> 92         IN THE RAPIDS. one, but I said, ' Mr. Baxter, do let us hear one of those lovely songs of your own composition, with which you used to charm everybody on the-steamer.'    There was- no guitar, he said, at hand, and he could not play the piano; but I answered that I had made myself familiar with most of them, and would accompany him. With- out waiting for further objection from him, I took my seat, and he at once came and stood beside me, and in a full, round, sustained voice, so equally filling the room with sound that you could scarcely tell where it came from, he sang my favorite of all his songs---" At this moment lights were brought in, and Mrs. Victor started up, and, moving to the piano, said, "I remember it very well, and I will run over it and show you how it goes." Seating herself, she sang as fol- lows:-                            l "' Our way is o'er the sea, love, And night is looming on the lee; But moon nor stars care I to see; The light of thine eyes is enough for me, While our way is o'er the sea, love. ' Our way is o'er the sea, love, And home, dear home's still far to the lee; I care not now how far it be; The light of thine eyes makes home for me, While our way is o'er the sea, love. "'Our way is o'er the sea, love, And clouds are low'ring on the lee; But what care I if storm there be? In the light of thine eyes is peace for me, While our way is o'er the sea, love.'   IN THE RAPIDS.        93 "Now, isn't it sweet? Certainly; I knew you'd like it. Well, the effect was just what I expected. All present were delighted, except Julius, and I was watch- ing him through my half-closed eyelids, and the blush of mortification began stealing over his face as the first notes of the song came out, and by the time it , .s ended he was as red as a boiled lobster. Willis wanted to sing another, but I was afraid he might spoil the effect he had already produced, and I would not let him. That's one fault with men who can sing, and with some who can't. When once they begin, they never know when to stop; and I know some women just as bad. Well, I began immediately talk- ing to Willis, and so cut short his siningng. When the company broke up, I was dying to have Willis go home with me. But that would have been too bad; and so, not having his company, I talked all the way home about nothing but his song, and begged Julius to look through the music-stores next day and see if it were not published, and a great deal more to the same purpose. The next evening Julius called, and I was not at home, to him. Willis called in half an hour after, and I was, to him. Now, I will ac- knowledge that I tried right hard to make him think I was in love with him. You know a woman will always go farther when she means nothing than when she is in earnest. I flattered myself that he felt all that I pretended to feel. Be that as it may, my little scheme worked well; for I was sure at least of his being a constant visitor long enough to operate sufficiently upon Julius's jealousy to bring him to an explanation.    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6869-00000048"/> "      IN THE RAPIDS. It came sooner than I expected. One evening, when they were both at my home together, I permitted my attention to preponderate so greatly in favor of Willis, that Julius 'sat him out,' as they say, and in less than twenty minutes after the way was clear for him he was at my feet, not metaphorically, but actually so. I referred him to pa, whom we could hear walking in the adjoining room. I listened to their conversation, for I was anxious to know what kind of style he would put on. He refused at first, then, finally, and with feigned reluctance, consented, with-the proviso that we should be married at once! I blushed to the roots of my hair when I heard this, for I thought it would spoil everything. But it did not. Julius seemed to see nothing but the danger of my being carried off by Mr. Baxter, and if it were any case but my own I would say that it was purely to spite him that he finally and promptly made me his wife. Willis learned the state of the case from my own lips; -and he was unques- tionably disappointed,-whether at the sudden ending of what he designed to make a mere flirtation, or at his defeat in what he honestly meant as a real affair of the heart, I cannot in candor undertake to decide. Vanity is our besetting sin, and, having had experience enough to know that, I always give it the disadvantage of a doubt. One thing I am sure of, and that is, WiIl lis did not know until too late, if at all, that I was  merely making use of him. I have not seen him until yesterday for a long, long time, and, let him have seen or now remember what he may, he has not a trace of unkind feeling left. He is one of the most candid of   IN THE RAPIDS.        95 men, and wears his heart upon his sleeve, if ever any one did. Bless me, Miss Darwin, are you asleep? Excuse me; I thought you were. You have sat there so long without speaking scarcely a word--" This was, I suppose, her way of expressing the im- possibility of my doing so if I had desired it. She had rattled away as uninterruptedly and unceasingly as the rain and sleet had been beating against the windows, and as they continued to beat, as we, sepa- rating for the night, retired to sleep. Almost any one except myself would have lost confidence in Mrs. Victor after this delectable revelation of her matrimonial manceuvring. But if I had per- mitted a bad opinion of her character to obtain lodg- ment in my mind, I should straightway have dropped all show of respect for her in our necessary intercourse; and such is my disposition that, rather than wound her feelings, I continued, in spite of the correcter judgment which should have guided nie, to hold her in fair es- teem, seeking an excuse for her in her troubles and forlorn condition. I could not, however, smother a feeling needing but slight encouragement to amount to disgust at her blaring display of family and conjugal secrets so derogatory to the character of her father and husband. Mere girl as I was then, and without instruction on such subjects, I instinctively saw the meanness of what was indifference or sport to her. We are not only fearfully and wonderfully, but many of us very absurdly made, which I say reverently. But it is not uncommon to meet. with a self-satisfaction and moral comfortableness in the reception and ex-  ,      <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6869-00000049"/> 96       IN THE RAPIDS. pression of ideas below a certain grade of delicacy much past my comprehension. If anything in this conversation of Mrs. Victor's seems to derogate from Mr. Baxter's character such as the subsequent facts herein related display it, I must not be charged with any inconsistency in regard thereto. I confess to a strong prejudice in his favor having subsequently obtained with me; and it is in my anxiety to be strictly truthful that I record Mrs. Victor's testimony, leaving its value to be fixed when her character is better developed. , 1   CHAPTER VIII. ARAILROAD had been completed recently from the city to-a-prominent point on the bay, and its course lay along the farther bank of the river whose relation--to our place has been before described. The stretch of land embraced by the connecting lines of the bay and the river on that side for miles in each direction had been for some years under settlement and cultivation. Rising abruptly from the river, the land sloped downward by a gentle inclination, and fields of grain, meadow-lands, remnant clumps of forest, and farm-haous?, with their trim outhuildings and fencing, lay?stretched out in varying and prolonged succession.-asfar as the eye could reach, presenting a panoramic -picture which impressed the mind not only with the beauty that met the external sense, but with -those ideas of security, comfort, and peace which in- spire as well as result from well-regulated rural indus- try. The new facilities for access rendered the locality desirable as a summer resort, and accordingly cottages and farm-houses, and sites for dwellings, were rented i or purchased by people from the city. As sqen as the road was finished, a bridge was thrown across the i river, close to our main entrance, principally for the  convenience of a village situated higher up the bay and fronting on it and joining our domain in that di- 9       (97)    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6869-00000050"/> 98       IN THE RAPIDS. rection. In fact, the site of it was once ours, pur- chased, not inherited, and afterwards disposed of, by my father. In the early part of the June succeeding my return from school, while I was out one day with my mother, she expressed a desire to cross the bridge and vary our ride-by a visit to this locality. Just as we left the bridge we encountered a carriage, in which I recognized two of my schoolmates--the Catons. We had not been very intimate, but sufficiently so to make our meeting agreeable. My mother was much pleased at the prospect of the circle of my society being enlarged, and she took occasion to express a desire that the families should visit each other, which was heartily responded to by the girls and their parents, who were with them at the time. In due course we were brought in contact with two or three other families from the city, temporarily sojourning in the neighborhood. I cared very little for-or I may say I had a repugnance to-increasing the number of my acquaintances; but my mother appeared to take so much pleasure in it that I offered no objection, and for a like reason I ac- quiesced in her suggestion to signalize the new order of things by something in the nature of a fete chamn- petre. In all matters of a domestic character which fell under my mother's direction or of which she took charge, there was always a liberal-or, to speak more correctly, a prodigal-expenditure of money. Her notions of taste and comfort were of the most elevated and refined nature, and would admit of nothing but  i;   IN THE RAPIDS.        99 what was perfect and ample. The arrangements for our gala day were to be based in one respect, of course, on the number to be present; and, while those es- pecially asked were the few old friends of my mother in the city, the Catons were given a carte blanche to invite whom they chose, their associations being unex- ceptionable. Descending from the porch which was on the side of the house looking towards the river, and passing across the grounds and through the gate, you came to a smooth piece of lawn, which it would take you ten minutes to stroll across. Beyond this was a piece of woods of similar width, of which a few of the trees were low-branched oaks of immense size, and the others beech and chestnut, with an occasional Lom- bardy poplar. Passing through this bit of woodland, you reached a point where a semicircular indentation in the river-bank made a miniature bay, to which the earth descended all round by a slope so gradual and so thickly grass-covered that you might fancy the space had been artificially- scooped out and the ground covered with a velvet carpet. On the lawn, close to the wood, a quadrangular frame had been laid, sup- ported by posts a foot or so high, and covered with smooth flooring. A canvas canopy was stretched from upright posts placed at intervals around it, the four corner ones being higher than the others, and from each of them waved white pennants' edged with blue. Tables were set up in a cleared space in the woods just below the little bay, and in full view of the oppo- site bank of the river and the lovely sylvan panorama    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6869-00000051"/> 100      ' IN THE RAPIDS. which started from it. The day opened beautifully.

The first arrivals were the old friends of the family from the city; next the Catons, who, having selected a large number of the guests, had to be present to re- ceive them. All first came to the house, where my parents and myself awaited them in the parlors. I was most agreeably surprised to find that all the chil- dren who could be gathered up in all the families em- braced in the invitation were to come, not only because I had always a longing for children's society, but I also knew my mother to take great pleasure in it. In an hour after the first arrival the parlors, hall, and porches were filled. Although all the guests were presented to me, I could not pretend to. recall their names; while I was conscious of the necessity of some orderly disposition of them, so as to enter upon the amusements of the day in the manner most likely to make the pleasure as general as possible. As nearly all present were acquainted with each other, the con- tagious chatter of the children spread through the whole assemblage, and a scene of gay, hilarious confu- sion ensued, which, while it augured well for the good   IN THE RAPIDS.        O I humor of my new friends, bade fair to last the entire day, and so distracted me as to render me for a time incapable of thinking at what point I ought to take up the new and delicate duty devolving upon me. Chil- dren were hiding from and chasing one another, and calling at each other from hall to parlors and from the porches through the windows. Their elder com- panions, collected in little coteries of two, three, or more, were all talking as if each had come for some pressing and hurried personal interview, making a general buzz of voices and confusion of motion which reminded me of nothing so much as of my first even- ing's experience at the school in the city. My mother, "observing my embarrassment, said to me, ,", We will ask Miss Caton, here," taking one of the girls by the hand, "to select some gentleman whom she knows to be adapted to the task to act in con- junction with you and herself to bring order out of this chaos, and to take the general direction of matters during the day." Agnes, the one thus addressed, said, "Brother will be here in a moment, and he is the very man for it. Helen Paisely would have him drive her round by the upper bridge. I think all this clatter is delightful. Let us enjoy it until he comes." In a few minutes the sound of a rapidly-driven vehicle was heard approaching. "Come," said Agnes; "this is brother and his lady-love. We must catch him before he gets in here. He knows all this party, and if once they seize on him it will be an hour before we get his ear." We accordingly hastened out as fast as the crowded state of the apartment permitted. 9*    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6869-00000052"/> 102      IN ITE RAPIDS. The gentleman in question was still some distance from the house, walking towards it, and accompanied by a lady leaning on his arm in what any one at the first glance would have pronounced a state of affected fatigue, This lady was of medium height, but of so 'spare a figure that she would be considered tall. The idea of fatigue, or of indolence, or perhaps weakness, was suggested by all the particulars of her person and dress. Her head seemed weary of the load of raven hair, which it would appear that no style or amount of labor in dressing could sufficiently restrain, and which inclosed like a cowl a face oval in form, perfectly symmetrical, and of which the complexion had the merest trace of the impress of a southern sun. Her upper eyelids drooped so low as to leave perceptible between the long, dark lashes only a faint line of the deep, soft, dreamy light in which her eyes might be said to swim. A short basque of a delicate pink color, and of light texture, fastened only at the throat, but open and loose thence downwards, left the fancy to make up the' proportions of a bust terminating in a waist so slender that it could be spanned by her com- panion. One tiny hand trailed along the grass by its,  ribbon her straw "flat," and the other with outspread fingers firmly grasped the arm upon which she leaned, as if it would be impossible for her to walk without its support. Her figure yielded languidly, but grace- fully, to every motion.  "Is she not beautiful?" said Agnes, on one side of me. "What a half-dead-and-alive thing!" said Mrs.    IN THE RAPIDS.       103 Victor, who had just come up, on the other. "That's Mr. Baxter with her," she added, in a whisper, as the lady and her attendant were now mounting the steps. Agnes said at the same moment, "Let me introduce Miss Paisely-and my brother." After exchanging salutations and making known the duty with which it had been arranged to charge the latter, I drew Agnes aside for an explanation of her calling " brother" the person in whose dress and style I recognized our former visitor, even before Mrs. Victor gave me his name. "He's: only our half-brother, but he is worth half a dozen whole ones. This is not the first time that our way of calling him has perplexed people who, familiar with our names, did not know our relation. But I would not forego the pleasure of calling him brother  "' "Not if it would insure you a husband?" said Mrs. Victor, whose quick ear had overheard us. "That is what I should have said," rejoined Agnes, "if I were entirely possessed with the idea of getting one." "Whatever other arrangements are made," said my mother, coming up, "I want the children allotted to Mrs. Victor and myself. We will keep them apart from the rest of the company and arrange amusements for them." This was done to suppress the widow, whose as- suming manner heretofore had not passed without criticism, but was, on the whole, submitted to in my    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6869-00000053"/> I o4      IN THE RAPIDS. behalf, as her society, to say the least, afforded me diversion. Mr. Baxter, meanwhile, entering fully into the spirit of his part, had collected the boys and marshalled them in two rows a couple of yards apart and extend-t ing from the porch towards the lawn. His sister simi- larly arranged the little girls, placing them between the two ranks of boys; and between the double rows thus formed, the rest of the company, in a procession of couples, marched to the music of the band in the di- rection of the pavilion, the little girls facing about and following close to us, and the boys in turn -following them. When the centre of the lawn was reached, the children were detached from us, and we, keeping on, were led into the pavilion, and dancing presently. began. The kind of music provided surprised me most agreeably. 'As I had never danced before to anything but a piano, the inspiriting sounds produced by the combination of wind and string instruments gave an entirely new character to the amusement. I felt as if I knew for the first time what dancing really meant. There was something also of this effect due to the strangeness of the sounds where I now heard them; and, in fact, everything that demanded my attention,-- the numbers and gayety of those immediately around me, the gambols of the children on the lawn, whom I' kept sight of as much as possible, their happy laugh- ter and their tiny songs,- now drowned -by, now heard above, the music,-all these sights and sounds appeared like the production of a fairy power; and I sometimes j   .   IN THE RAPIDS.,       105 had half a thought that the whole would vanish sud- denly and the old pervading solitude of the place return. Miss Paisely had refused to dance, but now took the floor with Mr. Baxter. The contrast between her slight form and his large but graceful person was very striking. She still for a time retained the same languor of carriage and expression as she floated round to the soft measure of the music, yielding en- tirely to the movements of her companion; but, as she had a figure which gave grace to every attitude, her motions were as purely beautiful as if each one had been a separate study. All eyes were turned upon her, and the floor was entirely abandoned to her and her companion. I heard her say, "Quicker," as they passed the music, and the line of light between her raven lids became brighter and broader. The hand which rested upon her companion's shoulder crept gradually around his neck, bringing them closer together and causing: her head to be thrown back, while the increased rapidity of her motion raised her, dress and exposed a pair of feet which could have worn the slippers of Cinderella. The measure of the music still quickened. The light in which her half- closed eyes had seemed to float, appeared to be ab- sorbed, as they gradually and fully opened, to beam with greater brilliancy from within. Faster yet went the music, and they still flew round in their dizzy and perilous whirl, clinging so closely together, and in such rapid but inexpressibly graceful motion, that it was, difficult to distinguish that there were two persons,    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6869-00000054"/> 106      IN THE RAPIDS. while all minds were suspended between a sense of fear and a feeling of excited admiration. Finally, they reached a degree of rapidity beyond which it would have been impossible for them to control their motion, when we were relieved by hearing the gentleman say, "Slower," and the music gradually slackened, until it reached a measurewhich enabled the others to return to the floor, and the waltz became general, when the couple who had given us-shall I say?-the exhibition which I have described, retired. The gentleman looked as if he had submitted to rather than participated in it. My own sense of propriety revolted against such a display; but, as I heard no reprehensory comment from any one around me, I concluded it to be illustrative, as far as it went, of the " glorious, gay" experiences to which my governess would tempt me. It produced a state of excited feeling which made plain dancing seem tame to every one, and a stroll through the woods down to the river, being suggested, was generally acquiesced in. As I had not given my attention to any of the gentlemen more than my posi- tion absolutely required, I seized on one of the Catons, whom  I found standing alone, for my companion during this promenade. Lpon reaching the little bay, we found a number of skiffs, flat-bottomed, sharp- prowed boats, collected there from the other side of the river. "This is my brother's work," said my fair escort,  "He proposes a boat-race. Listen to what he has to say about it. Here he comes." Mr. Baxter submitted his plans, to which we, as his   IN "THE RAPIDS,       Io7 coadjutors, assented, and which I will describe as they were carried out.   " The ladies selected four gentlemenfi as champions. The gentlemen, by secret ballot, selected four ladies, and were directed to be guided by their judgment as to beauty in making choice, as one out of the four was to make a distinguished figure in an attendant cere- mony. Miss Paisely and myself were among the four. The others, as it will appear; need not be named. In the prow of each of the four boats were erected slender cedar poles or staves cut fromn the woods, and the rib- bons from our flats, taken as banderoles, were attached to them to mark by their several colors the boat in which each of us embarked her fortune for the time. The race was to begin at the little bay, and the boats were to go up the stream, turn at the new bridge, and come back) and he who should first reach the bay and plant the streamer from the prow of his boat in a designated spot on the top of the bank, was to be declared the victor. All the party, save the four rowers, either em- -barked in the spare boats to witness the race from the -water, or took to their horses to meet the contestants at the bridge or follow them along the bank. We were not left to chqose who should man our respective boats. If was decided by lot, and chance assigned Mr. Baxter to mine, which bore a white streamer. Miss Paisely's was scarlet. Black and yellow were the other colors. With the prows turned outward, and the "oars in place, the signal for starting was sounded by the trumpet of the band, and away they went! The children had all been- assembled on the bank to wit-    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6869-00000055"/> 108      IN THE RAPIDS.  ness their departure, and greeted it with delighted screams and clapping of hands. The spectators in the boats stood up and waved their handkerchiefs and hallooed as they passed, and we who were on horse- back cheered them with our plaudits until an inter- vening woods screened them from our sight. The route of access to the bridge from where we started was circuitous, and we had to take quite a brisk pace to get there in time to see them coming up, which they did nearly together; and, in fact, it would appear that they had tacitly consented to have the contest commence at the return, for there were no signs either of great exertion or anxiety, as, passing under us, they interchanged remarks with us or among themselves. But presently they shot back from under the bridge with redoubled speed, and lo! the white ribbon led the way. The others maintained- for a time a position nearly in a line with each other, or, if they varied from it, it was impossible to distinguish from our position. We concluded to follow theffi down the bank as far as we could. When we were near enough to clearly make out their relative positions, the scarlet ribbon was slightly ahead of the other two, but still a full boat's-length behind my color. The rowers were tugging strenuously, and were animated no doubt as much by the chleers and applause which we sent them while we could, as by the desire of coming out vic- torious. -  A small patch of marsh extending from the wood to the water intervened, and we had to mount the bank and make the circuit of the obstacle. It was quite a   iN THE RAPIDS.       I09 race among ourselves who should first get a look at them. When they were once more in sight, the scarlet ribbon was fluttering nearly in a line with the white, and the other two colors were two boat-lengths to the rear. The foremost two rowers were laboring man- fully, but a short distance remained to the goal; and I must acknowledge-that the close competition and the danger of seeing my color lose a victory, which at the outset appeared so sure, excited me intensely. I was still ahead, however, and was hopeful. We again had occasion to deflect from the bank. I was behind, and just as I reached the top of the acclivity and my horse was about to change his mo- tion, the saddle-girth broke, and I was deposited on the ground, feet foremost, however, and erect, as it was an accident for which I always kept myself prepared. I could have cried with vexation. I, who a few months 'before was so entirely dead to every ordinary human influence, was now so carried away by the desire to witness the close of this unimportant contest, that I was almost brought to what is usually considered the sign of the severest grief at the disappointment! Gathering up my skirt, I ran with all possible haste over the short distance yet to be traversed. Manly huzzahs, the screaming and clapping of hands of the girls and the children, and the braying of the trumpet flared--on my ears as I came panting out of the woods to witness the scarlet ribbon flying from the staff just planted at the top of the bank. One of the thole-pins of Mr. Baxter's boat had broken within a few yards of the sho,; while he was ,0 i    .    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6869-00000056"/> IIO      IAr THE RAPIDS. yet ahead; he lost his balance, and was thrown down by the accident, and he was lying on his back in the bottom of his boat while Helen Paisely's champion was hastening with her ribbon up the bank. The sudden change of my countenance, from an expression of gratified triumph to one of disappointment, must have been very comical; for I was met by a general laugh, in which I could not but join. The decision in favor of Miss Paisely proved a very appropriate one, and I was subsequently more than gratified at having been defeated. I soothed Mr. Baxter's mortification on ac- count of his ridiculous accident, by thanking him, in the kindest words I could command, for his vigorous though unsuccessful exertions. Only one of the visitors present owed his invitation to my father, to whose society he had, for the most part, confined himself, and, he being in charge of the refreshments (a sinecure office entirely, for an adept caterer from the city had been engaged, not only to provide, but to superintend the distribution of them), his friend employed the opportunity to indulge excess- ively in wine, and presented himself among us, just after the termination of the boat-race, in a state of in- toxication. After annoying us awhile by endeavoring to engage one after another in conversation, he made his way to one of the skiffs, and, standing up on the seat in the stern, he seemed desirous of making amends -for his failure to command our attention and elicit our admiration individually, by a general address to the party. It was no bad situation for a proper affair of the sort. The top and sloping sides of the bank of the   IN THE RAPIDS.       I I I little bay were occupied by spectators, disposed some- what after the manner of an audience in an amphi- theatre, and the position taken by this person was the best possible in which to be seen or heard by them. Some people can laugh at a drunken man, and of such there were more than enough on this occasion. But to me it would be a painful task to describe his absurd antics and gesticulations, or to repeat his more absurd vociferations. While I was thinking'of the trouble he was likely to give us during the rest of the day, one of the gentlemen near me started towards the boat, saying, as he went, "I have a perfect talent for abating a nuisance." Getting in the skiff, he took asingle oar, and, using it as a pole, he pushed gently a length or so from the shore, and then, reversing the motion, he gave a sudden and vigorous shove towards the shore, whipping the boat from under the feet of the would-be orator in the midst of his most extravagant rigmnarole, and plunged him headlong backward into the river. This feat was received by a unanimous and approving shout. There was no danger from the depth of the water at that place, and the victim of the manceuvre was leit to make his- own way out, sufficiently sobered by his bath to recognize the propriety of retiring for a change of raiment. If this man had been to me an object of indifference or of mere passing contempt, I might have enjoyed, to the moderate extent of which my pensive nature is capable, his appropriate discomfiture. But, slight as was my acquaintance with him,--I had seen him, but once or twit/, in company with my father, never I    *      !    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6869-00000057"/> "2      INA THE RAPIDS. spoken to him,-I felt that I dared not mock him; but I loathed him by instinct and feared him by presenti- ment. His whole presence was sinister to me, and the catastrophe did not belie his omens. But for the mys- terious dread of him, I felt I might have pitied him in his disgrace; his vengeance was as complete as if I had viciously, cruelly exulted. He lived not far from us, and was known as-I shudder, tremble, as I write the name-young Brandon. A resort to the refreshment tables was now in order; and, as appetite had not been spoiled by the slightest anticipatory indulgence, the good things set before us were partaken of with a zest inspired by exercise, long fasting, and a prevailing good humor, which would sweeten far homelier fare. An hour was given up to desultory chit-chat, and then dancing was resumed, during which I left the pavilion to have a look at the children, but I found they had been spirited away. Mother, and all the rest of the elderly people, as well as Mr. Baxter, Miss Paisely, and one of the Misses Caton, had likewise disappeared. I returned then among the dancers, to await the something which was to happen. In about two hours word came that the music was wanted in that portion of the woods which was immediately opposite the front of the house, and that the trumpet would give a signal for us to assem- ble on the lawn in its vicinity. The signal was awaited with some impatience, for it was delayed so long that we began to think the day would end before it came. But it came at length, and we took a position facing a long avenue of sycamores which terminated in a /   IN THE RAPIDS.       II3 circular space in the very heart of the woods. This circular space was cleared, except of a thick clump of trees in the centre. The avenue widened as it ap- proached the circle, and the clump in the centre served as a curtain which left the imagination to prolong the avenue beyond it, or to create for itself any forest picture whatever. Behind this curtain the band was playing a simple strain of perhaps a dozen bars. It was no doubt the invention of the moment, and it was repeated often enough for any one within hearing to commit it to memory. In order to make all that followed credible to those who did not witness it, I must state that our place was famous for the multitude of " running roses," as they are commonly called, which grew on vines clinging to every wall, outhuilding fence, or post. The music ceased for a moment, and when it began again the voices of children singing were heard with it. By-and-by the little girls who had been spirited away came out from behind the curtain in a proces- sion of couples, wearing on their heads wreaths of alternate white and red roses set on bands of flat cedar. Next came four white goats, whose horns and harness were so covered with roses that the original material was entirely hidden. They seemed to be geared with flowers. They drew an extemporised tri- umphal car, made by placing the body of a gracefully- formed sleigh on wheels. The car was surrounded by a close pyramidal canopy, formed apparently of flowers and green leaves, and which concealed the, interior of the car; and on top of the canopy was IO*    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6869-00000058"/> II4       1 IN THE RAPIDS. something resembling a mammoth scallop-shell, filled and piled high with roses. The little boys who had * been spirited away, with roses pinned around their jacket-collars and down their sleeves, and wearing chaplets of flat cedar around their heads, were as- sisting to draw the car by ropes of roses, fastened at different points on each side of it,-save four of them, who, with similar ropes attached lo the horns of the goats, were guiding the progress of the car. This rosy procession came down the avenue, moving to the time of the simple strain which the band was still playing, the latter coming down through the woods in a parallel line, but keeping otrt of sight, the children singing,- "We come from the land of flowers, And live in sylvan bowers, Where all the rosy hours. Are passed in love and song. "There is no life like ours, In the happy land 'of flowers; Of love and youth the powers To us and our queen belong." Reaching the centre of the lawn, the car halted. The little girls clapped their hands three times, when instantly the canopy and the scallop-shell vanished, and, like the fire-balls from  a hundred exploding rockets, the freight of roses flew first upwards and then descended all around in a flowery shower upon the laughing, screaming, shouting children. Seated in the car, as if she had descended from the sky in the rosy rain, sat the queen of the land of flowers, the   IN THE RAPIDS.       11, nymph of the scarlet- ribbon s A chaplet of yellow wild jessamine crowned her, while blossoms of the white species of the same redolent flower were scat- tered through the folds and plaits of her abundant hair. Her dress, so arranged as to expose neck, shoulders, and arms, was literally overlaid with crim- son roses to the waist, while the skirt was covered with white and red buds in alternate rows, set on re- versed silver-maple leaves. The original garment was so completely hidden that she looked as if she were entirely clothed in a habiliment of flowers, so frail and delicate withal that you would, dread the coming of the gentlest zephyr, lest it might blow it all away, and its lovely wearer as well. Her majesty wore an expression of sublime oblivion to the presence of ordinary mor- tals;; nor were her tiny subjects more mindful, but, re- suming their march and their song, they crowded us before them across the lawn, through the woods, and over the top of the bank of the little bay, we gathering humbly on the strand below them. They filed around the semicircular rim of the bank, the girls occupying the extreme verge, while the boys stood behind, over- looking them, a vacant space being left at the centre for her majesty, who in due course, and with the leisurely I movement which is both a prerogative and a mark of royalty, descended from her car, came forward, and occupied it. A small delegation of officious clouds had come up to meet and conduct the retiring sun to his evening coucTh, and for a time surrounded and concealed him, thus casting their shadow over our elfin visitors; but    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6869-00000059"/> I 6         IN THE RAPIDS. he, disdaining their attentions, broke through them, and sent out a flood of golden light which settled like a halo around the charming group above us. The little dar- lings then sang as follows:- 6"We hail thee, gentle river! Bright be thy waters ever As beams that on them quiver. "We owe our darling queen to thee; A kind and gracious queen is she, And ever grateful will we be. "We hail thee, shining river, We greet thee, gliding river, We thank thee, generous river." Her majesty then returned to her car, and the pro- cession reformed, when the little creatures, all- turning round towards the water and curtseying or bowing, kissed their hands, and sang,- "Farewell, bright river; Good-by, sweet river; We owe our darling queen to thee; A kind and gracious queen is she, And ever grateful will we be. "Good-by, good river, We'll come again, kind river." They then resumed their march back through the woods and over the lawn, repeating,- "Back to the land of flowers, v  \   To dwell in sylvan bowers, And pass the rosy hours In love and joyous song.   IN THE RAPIDS.        I17 "There is no life like ours, In the happy land of flowers; Of love and youth the powers To us and our queen belong." And so, winding up the avenue and around behind the curtain of trees, and still singing, they disappeared, as many a bright, delightful vision has done before and since. This ended the day for those of our visitors who lived so far away as to compel their early departure. For the rest there remained a resort to the Lookout and its charming sunset scene. Other clouds had gathered round the retiring orb. Far from diminishing the splendor of his light, they received and reflected, varied and multiplied, its glory. Purple and crimson piles intermixed, o'ercapped by fleecy rolls, whose extremest verges, drifting into shreds, were tinged here with lines of gold, there with sea-shell pink. The ethereal blue of the open sky and the deep rich emerald of the ocean were repre- sented in the gorgeous collection, seamed here and there by the pure golden rays that broke effulgent through, and painted with their brilliant and parting hues the opposite horizon: changing ever, as if the sunsets of a century were passing in review and mirrored, in their beauty and their glory and their changes, in the waters below. A quick transition, and there was an instant lift of the clouds,-nay, was it not a sudden drop of the sun from their embrace? He stood poised upon the glassy surface waiting to receive him, now seeming to have    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6869-00000060"/> "8      IN THE RAPIDS. begun his final plunge, now seeming to recede in doubt back to the neglected clouds. When, lo! the track of light that he has thrown far along the bright- ened waters is met by a rush of as far-reaching but  gentler light. You turn, and look! Away at the opposite distant and cloudless verge of day stands poised the newly-risen full-orbed moon, toying an in- stant, like the giver of its light, with its image reflected in the waters. We gazed on this grand, beautiful scene in absolute silence. There was. none so frivolous as not to be deeply impressed and no one, surely, felt any power to add to the eloquence of such a picture. Like some marvellous, exquisite strain of music, whose notes are drifting in sweet succession irrevocably away, and whose faintest tinge. of sound we dread to lose, as we fear it never can be again perfectly repeated, merging all our faculties in receiving the deepest impress of its melody, so this overwhelming manifestation of almighty power and grandeur, this harmonious sweep and combination of objects, forms, ' and colors, admitted of no effort but that of realizing their sublime and beautiful effects. We felt that it had to pass away. Rapid as the quick succession of our thoughts were the changes of light and color; and we dared not risk, by sound or motion, the loss of a single harmonious transition. As if other faculties had to be repaid for their previous subordination, or as if what is eminently grateful to one is suggestive of gratification to others, I saw, with my confused and overexerted eyes, the   IN THE RAPIDS.        19 meeting tracks of light' upon ;the waters, split up into alternate and countless golden and silver chords stretching from setting sun to rising moon, and form- ing a resonant and melodious planet-harp, now touched to the faintest shadow of sweet sound by the rippling waters, now awakened by the sweep of the rising winds to the overwhelming crash of music from a myriad organs. The two orbs, quickened and visi- ble in their revolutions, emitted consonant melody. Every cloud, every color, every shade of light and shadow had a voice. The' winds and the waters playing the planet-harp sang as they played. Multi- tudinous voices in prayerful song peopled the illimita- ble shores. Angelic and answering melody streamed from the resounding sky. All that I saw and heard appeared to centre suddenly in myself. My every sense was occupied with a pleasure so keen and enrapturing that I felt as if I could not outlive it. I was equally possessed with a dread that I should be riven into atoms under the vibration of the tremendous and ever- swelling chorus. Rapidly seeking in the transient light of this exaltation of feelings and .faculties for a promise of something pure andt satisfying in human kind, I saw Repentance, and,' in his Maker, Forgive- ness, the most exalted attribute.    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6869-00000061"/> CHAPTER    IX. M  ISS PAISELY having expressed a dread of en- countering " the nipping and eager air'" from the river and bay to which she would be exposed by returning after sunset to the country-seat of the Catons, where she was domiciled at the time, I per- suaded her to pass the night with us. We were sur- rounded by forest, more or less dense, in all: directions; and hence our place was the better adapted to the comfort of a person coming from the warm latitude-in which she had spent most of her life. Much to my satisfaction, the next day passed without any sign of her leaving us; and so went the next and the next. Notwithstanding she was often visited with fits of in- dolence or torpor, both of mind and body, rendering her at such times indifferent and uninteresting to everybody, she was, on the whole, quite companion- able, and I was not sorry to observe that her visit was likely to be a protracted one. It is not well to seek for a motive beyond the expressed one in matters in which we have only a transient interest, unless we intend to create the de- testable and fixed habit of suspicion; but I could not avoid the thought, in this case, that the sudden and almost permanent change was not owing solely to this young lady's preference for our society. It undoubt- (120o)   I Ni 'e IN THE RAPIDS.     121 edly afforded her an opportunity of judging whether Mr. Baxter's attentions to her arose from his sense of the duties of hospitality, or was owing to personal re- gard for her.; I learned that she was very wealthy, and that his family anxiously desired a match to be made up between them. But he was so generally attentive to all women; both old and young, who came in his way, that :itx was difficult to decide by what motive he was actu- J ated in her particular case. Be that as it may, he did not permit the first afternoon to pass without calling, and thereafter, so far as his mere presence could do so, con- tinued to afford Miss Paisely the proof she sought,- that is, supposing my suspicion correct. But, while gratified in this respect, she was exposed to the annoy- ance of having a rival in Mrs. Victor. Notwithstand- ing my mother's occasional interference, this lady arrogated every privilege of which she could make use. It would have been extremely difficult for a casual visitor to decide what were our relative positions in the family. But she made herself so serviceable, had been so entertaining during the sad time immediately fol- lowing my return from school, and withal had acquired so undeniable an influence over all around her by the admirable audacity of her assumption, that it passed into a nearly settled, though tacit, opinion that she must be endured for a time. She was like the needless evils forming a portion, more or less, of every human life, which are submitted to because they can at any mo- ment be gotten rid of, and in consideration of some convenience which it requires too much self-denial to part with. TI  At    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6869-00000062"/> 122       IN THE RAPIDS. She managed never to suffer Mr. Baxter to be with Helen without finding some pretext to join them. His business took him almost daily to the city. He came to our house generally late in the afternoon, upon his return, and occasionally called during an early morn- ing ride. At these times Mrs. Victor was at leisure. She succeeded in removing froml Helen's mind all ob- jections to her presence, by so insinuating herself into her confidence as to induce her to suppose that she was desirous to assist rather than to thwart her in gaining the gentleman's affections; representing that he was an old friend, and that she knew all his fancies and antipathies, and so counselling her, both as to what she ought to do and as to the effect of what she had done from time to time (pretending also to have his confidence), that Helen was led to do and say many things which Mrs. Victor intended should prejudice her cause in a general way, and especially to disgust Mr. Baxter by anticipating a degree of success not actually obtained. In all this, Helen's mental indo- lence was her enemy's chief weapon. She had a mind which could be exalted to the exercise of considerable power by opposition or the appearance of difficulty; but a fair assurance of success set both her vigor and her watchfulness to sleep. How Mr. Baxter was affected, at the time, by these proceedings, I cannot say, even with the assistance of the wisdom following the event from which I derive what I have said or may say of the others. Under an exterior of almost foppish refinement there were in him much practical vigor of mind and remarkable evenness   IN THE RAPIDS D       123 of temper, and he possessed that sort of politeness of which kindness is the basis, as well as the suavity of manner often existing without it. He had known Mrs. Victor in better days, and I have reason for say- ing that, in spite of her efforts to conceal the fact, he was aware of her present dependent position. This rendered him doubly careful of her feelings, and, how- ever objectionable to him might be her incessant presence with Helen, there was nothing he would have more carefully avoided than to let this feeling be per: ceived. I imagined, however, that he would rather have had her out of the way, and thus accounted for the occa- sional pleasure I had of his company in a walk or ride, now and then, during which I encountered him on his way to visit us. His conversation was very entertaining, and the piquancy of his old-school style of gallantry, with which my mother was so familiar, and of which she delighted to talk, had its zest increased by the briefness of these few interviews; for I invariably shortened my promenade so as to place him in Helen's company as soon as possible. At such times as I was with the others during his visits, his attentions, always agreeable, were so general that it was impossible for either to suspect, so far as I could see, that her absence was desired.                p At this time " young"Mr. Brantdon began to renew his visits. I had evinced my repugnance to him so distinctly that they had hitherto been very rare, notwithstanding my father's unaccountable patronage of him. Now, however, as if he felt himself regener-    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6869-00000063"/> 124      IN THEI RAPIDS. ated by the baptism which he had undergone, and deemed himself thereby a more acceptable acquaint- ance, he inflicted his presence upon us with increasing frequency. His father, who was a vulgar, low-bred man, had begun his business life in a small way in the village adjoining us, before alluded to. My father had parted with that property piecemeal to its several tenants. This man, operating with the petty but miserly accumulated savings of years, succeeded, during a protracted decline in every branch of industry, in involving the owners of nearly all these homesteads, and unmercifully sacrificed them. Subsequent specu- lations in other directions, and on a more extensive scale, Phad made him comparatively wealthy. Deter- mined that his son-should not fail through want of education to enjoy the social privileges which he found that his money could not procure for himself, even in this land where money is so powerful, he gave him a thorough college training. He returned full-fledged at the same time that I did. Whatever education had done for him, it had not made him a gentleman. It was im- possible for him to talk five -minutes without being both impertinent and vulgar. Mr. Baxter's courtly manners were at once his example and his envy. His studied attempts to imitate them would, on the stage, have been considered capital burlesque. Their per- sons were in equal contrast. He was short and ungainly. His mouth and protuberant eyes suggested the visage of a frog, and his ears were enormous; and the power of wagging them, which he boasted of and   IN THE RAPIDS.       125 frequently practiced, often gave rise to a comparison more apposite than delicate. Mrs. Victor, in her desperate struggle for a second husband and with -her talent for bending every person and circumstance to her purpose, found use for this individual. Thus far her operations had been directed towards damaging Helen's prospects. It was now time to attend to furthering her own; and for this pur- pose she must be relieved of her constant watch over and her evil tuition of her rival. That the man I have just described could be made to assist her, appears no doubt, a most ridiculous conception. But it is one which she actually carried into effect. Mr. Brandon was made to know the great wealth and high sociWal position of Helen's family, both of which points the aspiring young man was instructed by his worthy father to consider essential in his matrimonial views. Great as was the vanity required to make him believe he had found favor in such a woman's eyes, he pos- sessed sufficient and to spare. Instructed as to her character, and especially as to her weaknesses, by Mrs. j Victor, who thoroughly understood her, he succeeded- in making himself endurable, assisted by the following circumstance. Having a good memory, a fair com- mand of language, and being a good linguist, and withal fresh from his books and his tutors, he was not a bad talker upon literary subjects; and, prone to dispute, he drew Mr. Baxter most unwillingly into discussions which turned upon verbal niceties and depended for their decision upon correct references, thereby carrying his point frequently, and as often by 4 -    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6869-00000064"/> 126      IN THE RAPIDS. wearying and disgusting his antagonist, who, if he governed his feelings upon all other subjects, did not disguise his thorough contempt for him. The widow was at hand to instruct Helen that Mr. Baxter was jealous of his literary accomplishments, and that he chafed under Mr. Brandon's ostensible superiority; that rivalry in one respect-begets a fear of it in other respects, and that, therefore, it was in her power to excite Mr. Baxter's jealousy and secure his entire devotion by cultivating the society of his literary superior. Helen acted on this suggestion, and Mr. -Brandon thus obtained much of her society, as well as by attending to her wants in numerous petty ways, such as going into the city to make purchases for her, selecting novels, cutting their leaves, and sometimes reading to her. Such was her indolence, and such his devotion in these trifles, under Mrs. Victor's mani- pulation, that she would almost regard his absence as a calamity. He visited us at first for an altogether different purpose, as will appear; but it was one which his present hallucination induced him to suppose he could forego. Of course the widow's purpose in the use she made of him was to alienate Mr. Baxter. She knew that contempt and disgust, and not jealousy, would result. Still further to effect it, she frequently contrived to have Helen and Mr. Brandon, who was essentially a man-if not a gentleman-of leisure, to accompany her to lonely parts of the forest, and then slip away, just before Mr. Baxter's arrival, in order that they might be seen by him coming out of it together, and that she might have him all to herself in   IN THE RAPIDS.       127 the interim. I describe this as if I were aware of all that was going on; but, candidly, I write from subse- quent information, as I have said before, and Mrs. Victor deserves whatever credit belongs to having deceived the whole of us. In the mean time, my own habits and thoughts were but little changed. from what I have described them. I necessarily spent much time in the society of all these persons, and was not' unfrequently alone with each of them. My own heart still turned to the object of its affections; and I was thus blind to much that I might otherwise have seen. I so controlled my thoughts, however, as to dwell absorbedly on his memory only at certain allotted periods. One was during an invariable daily ride alone; the other was at night, in my bedroom, when I read either the whole or a portion of the record I have so often alluded to. I did not think on these occasions. Dismissing all other subjects, I opened wide my mind for the return of all my former thoughts on the subject. The, ideas came, tarried awhile, and then drifted away one after another,-a succession of familiar and delightful pic- tures, which I did not detain because the tide which bore them was under my own control. But, mainly self-centred as I was, I could not but take some interest in my handsome guest and pay some attention to the possible termination of her affair with Mr. Baxter. I regarded his enthrallment as a foregone conclusion, from the remark which dropped from his sister. Returning one morning from a ride on the beach, I was reflecting on the saying applied to    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6869-00000065"/> 128      IN THE RAPIDS. him by Mrs. Victor, -that " he wore his heart upon his sleeve," and came to the conclusion that, in this respect at least, my own observation of his character did not justify it, inasmuch as his imputed preference for Helen had not been made manifest. The imme- diate cause of its being in my mind at the time was that autumn was near at hand, and she was already making preparations to leave for home. I was return- ing, and was probably half-way to the house, but, being attracted by the nicely-managed manceuvres of a schooner beating under a stiff breeze down the bay, I had turned my horse's head towards the Lookout. I did not know how long I remained watching her, when I was startled by the sound of a horse's hoof not far behind me. I turned, and beheld Mr. Baxter in the rider. He was at the instant raising his hat and about to speak. "I have purposely intruded, Miss Cora," he said, "this morning upon the solitude of which you appear -so fond. But look!" he exclaimed, pointing to the little vessel I have spoken of; "that crazy fellow will be aground in a moment. I could throw a shell on his deck." "No," I said; "the water is very deep here. He has been even closer than that. See! he is about to tack." "Well managed, indeed!" he cried. "How kindly she obeys the helm, and moves away 'like a thing of life' indeed! When used to danger, we are prone to dare it to the utmost. She careens as if another breath would upset her. I must soon cross the ocean myself   IN THE RAPIDS.       129 again, and fain would settle, before I go, a matter in which your good will and intercession are indispen- sable." "You have my good will, sir," I said, "without the asking; but wherein can my intercession avail-you?" ' I will endeavor to show you," he replied. "My wish is to win a heart which has been turned, by un- toward influence from the path of thought that leads to solid happiness. But I detain you. Were you going farther?" "No, Mr. Baxter," I answered; "I was returning; but you interest me. Let us go towards the Lookout and meet the little vessel. She will be back this way directly." So we proceeded at a walk, the noise of the waves, as well as the breeze, preventing any faster gait if we desired t'o converse. "Tho'h "a young man,'* he continued, "I am old enough to have committed some errors which have taught me considerable wisdom. Among other things, I have learned that while romance is a most delightful counsellor in the early season of love, and sets the mind all aglow with troseate views of life, it is well to descend from the enchanting heights to which it leads, and which, while they ;gratify, really confuse our vision, and, taking judgment for our guide, descendto the practical facts of existence. We must do thi^s Be a . dream never so sweet, the time of awakt  ut a come.' - "Admitting all which," said I, " to what-4e  in your case?"    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6869-00000066"/> 130      IN THE RAPIDS. "For you to admit it," he rejoined, "as I have your good will already, is to secure you as my advocate." "Next tell me," I asked, "what I am to plead, and to whom." "Your greatest labor will be," he answered, " to undo what has been done, to remove prejudices, to put a quietus on feelings which should never have been aroused. Does the magnitude of the, task frighten you? Can I count so far upon your interest?" "Reckon my good will at what you please," I said; "but do not trust too much to my power." e  "In fact," continued he, pursuing his previous thought, "to strengthen, to purify the judgment to which I must appeal, is the most I should ask of you. The rest I must even undertake myself." We were nearing the narrow part of the peninsula, where the tide at times overflowed it. It was now traversed by a belt of water a couple of yards or more wide, over which the wavelets were chasing one another. Putting our horses into a gallop, we cleared it together. ,We were thus close to the Lookout, towards which the little vessel was rapidly coming. Passing round to the narrow ledge of beach beyond, we got up before her course was changed. She came on, dashing the foam from her prow, the wind piping through her cordage, and the water rustling around her in a swelling rush of sound. It was impossible not to catch excitement from such a scene. We waved our handkerchiefs and cheered, as, veering gracefully, she stood away, and answering cheers from the crew came back on the wind.   IN THE RAPIDS.       131 "Observe," said my comlpanion, "the keen sweep  of her outlines against the background of sky and water. See how they vary as she turns, forming new combinations, making a new picture, each instant." We both remained silent for awhile, watching her. He' then turned to me, and said, "I wish I could have freighted her with all that I would remove from the mind and heart of the person of whom I was just now speaking, so that-we could be together here alone, she ready to listen to what I am most anxious to say. Certain as I was that this person was Miss Paisely, I determined not to understand it. I wanted to see with what countenance he would name her. I said, laughing, "Excuse me, Mr. Baxter, but if I make no more progress in assisting your purpose than you have in explaining it, you will wish that you had looked elsewhere for help. Am I to think that gen- tlemen are all timid in such matters? Show a fair amount of courage, or I shall desert you in the outset of the struggle." "Well, then," said he, as we turned homeward, "within three months, and possibly within one, I must leave for Europe on important business, which will detain me there no one knows how long. Before going, I wish to gain the hand of-yes, and marry, in order to take with me-a woman who must adopt much more practical views of life than she now has, before she would even listen to me. I must engage her to lay aside the overstrained notions which I alluded to  " "So poetically," said I.    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6869-00000067"/> 132      IN THE RAPIDS. "Jest, if you will," said he, "but hear me out, I beg you." "In such rosy language?" said I, "as if you had caught your inspiration in the land of flowers!" "Forbear, dear lady, for awhile," he exclaimed, in so serious a tone that I could not but gratify him; and he continued: "I must ask her to take the most mate- rial, every-day-life view of love and marriage. I have talked and can still think of them in the ideal; but, believe me, the happiness of wedded life depends on the most stubborn facts. It is unfortunate that I must press her to so early a decision. Women are so fond of our devotion. They all deserve it. It is my delight to pay it. But in this case I can only promise to make amends afterwards,--that is, if I am allowed the opportunity." "I still despair, sir," I said, "of learning how I am to proceed in assisting you." "Can you not, Miss Cora," he rejoined,-" can you not engage her to consider what I have been saying?" "I will certainly undertake it; but you forget that you have not yet had the courage to name her." "Miss Cora," he answered, "I have endeavored to make you understand, without using any name, that it s yourself." "Sir!"I exclaimed, utterly astounded, and involun- :arily reniing in my horse so suddenly that my com- panion passed a short distance ahead of me. Turning back towards me, he raised his hat, and )owing deeply, he said, "Pardon me, my dear lady, f I have taken you too much by surprise. I should   have remembered that, though constantly informing my own judgment since our introduction, I have care- fully concealed my design. What I have expressed might otherwise seem the result of a sudden freak. Be assured, however, I beg of you, that I have acted with due deliberation; and I do not ask, NOR DO I want, an immediate answer. I solicit you also to deliberate at  least as long as is compatible with the :urgency of my affairs." I had now collected my thoughts. ind was calm enough to say, "Mr. Baxter, my embarrassment does not arise from any doubt as to what I ought to answer. What you ask is simply impossible. To promise to deliberate would only be to deceive you." "I must again risk offending you," he rejoined, "by saying that I think I have divined your heart to be preoccupied; and of course I have not proceeded thus far without hoping for success if that bar were removed. I know I am treading on delicate ground, but please give me credit for honorable motives in telling you that I think you have formed, and not re- cently, a romantic, impracticable attachment. I rest my opinion on your habitual expression, your habits, and the simplest facts of your past life, which I trust you will believe I have learned without impertinently prying beyond the bounds of fair inquiry. If my con- jecture is correct, and leaving me out of view alto- gether, you cannot bear too strongly in mind that you are perilling your life-long happiness." "You will do me a favor," I said, "if you will drop the subject after answering me one question. Miss 12    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6869-00000068"/> 134      IN THE RAPIDS. Paisely came heralded as your choice. Was it not true at the time of her visit to us?" "I am happy at the opportunity," he replied, "of explaining that matter. The urgent wishes of my family, not less than a strong predisposition in her favor, rendered it possible, and the story a plausible one. But my being thrown in your society, which her own prolonged visit to you, in fact, induced more than anything else, has given me an opportunity for cool and calm deliberation, and I have made the choice which I announce to day." We had, meanwhile, resumed our way, and, arriving at the house, we parted without another word on the subject.   CHAPTER X. T TNDER no circumstances can a woman be indif- ferent to a declaration of love,-that is, provided it can be innocently entertained. It may excite con- tempt, but, if it be worthy of respect, whether it has been forestalled or not, we cannot avoid thinking to what it might lead if accepted. Whether prematurely or not, I had now reached a soberness and breadth of thought which enabled me to recognize some of the realities of life to which Providence kindly blinds our earlier vision. The hope of again seeing Laurence had gradually diminished; and doubtful as it was that it would serve my happiness to meet him, his image was still strong in my memory, and the feelings he had aroused yet lived. But at times, when conscious of being thoroughly imbued with a sense of resignation to the lonely life to which I seemed consigned, a sudden dismal sound of any kind, the tolling of a distant bell, the simple turning of a leaf by the wind, or the view of a cheerless piece of landscape, would instantly and over- whelmlingly oppress me, and the future loom up so dark that I could cry aloud for relief For some days following my conversation with Mr. Baxter I was fre- quently affected in this way, and to an unusual degree. He ceased coming for awhile; and I confess that, little as I used to see of him, and having regarded his visits (I35)    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6869-00000069"/> 136      ZN THE RAPIDS. as by no means directed to me, the place was much less cheerful without him. Helen suddenly deter- mined to return to the Catons' for a short while before starting for home. I pleaded my obvious indisposi- tion for withholding a promise to call upon her before she should leave, and hence we took a final farewell, parting with mutual and sincere sorrow. She was much out of spirits, and I felt that the house would not soon again have so amiable an inmate. Mrs. Victor became cross, sullen, and even uncommuni- cative. Mother was growing weaker, and kept her bed more than ever. I passed daily a certain portion of the time in her room. She was careful not to make direct inquiry as to the state of my feelings, but when the conversation led to it I always freely unburdened my mind. My interview with Mr. Baxter came up in due course. She was sitting up in bed at the time, and, after hearing me through attentively, she leaned back on her pillow and remained silent for a considerable time. Then, sitting up again, she began, with unusual emphasis,- "Now, my dear child, while I am prepossessed in favor of this gentleman, I will speak to you without any direct reference to him. It must be obvious to you that I am failing very fast. Give me, your hand, my child; I believe I am much weaker to-day." She stopped, as if overcome for the moment. I made no response, for I could not do so without exhibiting such agitation as would affect her. She continued: "I cannot live a great while longer; and it would be a   IN THrE RAPIDS.      137 bitter thing for me to die and leave you alone, unpro- tected  "She stopped again, turned her face away, and pressed my hand convulsively. "Oh, mother! dear mother!"I exclaimed, bursting into tears, and throwing my arms around her, "do not talk so! Do not talk of dying! you will break my heart. I have given you so much trouble." "No, no, my darling. No, my Cora," she cried, pressing me to her bosom. She trembled violently, and neither of us found it possible to speak for some time. Finally, recovering somewhat, she said, "Calm yourself, child. I must not give way in this man- ner." I left her side and went to the window and looked out. By-and-by, with her voice restored nearly to its ordinary firmness, she said,- "Come near me, Cora. I was going on to say, you ought not to be left unprotected, and, worse than that, a prey to a wild, unreal affection, which it is next to impossible that you should ever be able to gratify, and in all probability it is not desirable that you should. I have hitherto left the cure of it to yourself. But it is necessary for me to talk earnestly to you. I am not chiding you, but I wish to make you under- stand that your interest, your peace, lies in a different direction from that to which your thoughts have been mostly turned." "Mother," I replied, "I could not promise myself to forget Mr. Manning. Should I by any chance en- counter him, I being the wife of another man, my con- dition would be worse than at present." 12*    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6869-00000070"/> 138      IN TlHE RAPIDS. "I have not overlooked that danger; I do not urge you, my child," she said. "Act, if possible, entirely upon your own judgment. I think, though, if you were married to a sensible and affectionate husband, the future might be left to itself." Here our conver- sation on the subject stopped. Mr Baxter came again some days afterwards, finding me in a state of great perplexity. Mrs. Victor, how- ever, endeavored to appropriate him, with so much success that he was not for a moment alone with me. This was really a relief, for I had concluded nothing, and if he had renewed his proposal 'I would have been found unable to give it even the qualified considera- tion which the influences then bearing upon me were inducing me to entertain. On the following afternoon, as I was on the point of turning homeward from my ride, he came out on the road from a cross bridle-path a little beyond me, nd joined me. After the interchange of some ordi- nary remarks, he said,-- "I have sought this interview, Miss Cora, with the hope that you have not forgotten our conversation at the last one, and that the interim has not been spent in reflections altogether unfavorable to me." I hesitated before answering, because my mind was still unsettled. Finally, I replied,- "What would you expect my response to be, if, in addressing me, you were to add the assurance that your early, fresh affections had been elsewhere plighted, and that you could not candidly express the wish and did not feel the power to recall them?"   "Indeed, Miss Cora," he said, "I do not know any reply severe enough to a proposition so preposterous." "Then, sir," said I, "reverse the case, and you will at once see the absurdity of any answer other than the one I have already given."  "Will you not bear with me, my dear lady," said he, "if I endeavor to show an essential difference between the supposed case and the actual one?" "I will patiently hear," I replied, "anything you have to say." "No woman, my dear lady," said he, in an even, deliberate tone, as if he were about to weigh nicely every word he would utter, "no woman, except a foolish, jealous one, would accept a divided heart. A jealous one would ruin herself to spite a rival. Your sex-all of you-estimate us so low (and I would not undertake to dispute the opinion) that no pledge, how- ever sanctified, would banish the dread of ultimate total infidelity, where its partial existence was admitted or avowed at the outset. I, at least, whatever other men may do, think far differently of yours. Once you are married, your husband is all the world to you. His honor is a jewel without price, more precious to you than to him even; for where women have labored, suffered, even died, to save it untarnished, men have more frequently thrown it carelessly away. It is the accepted opinion that women act more from feeling than from judgment and that, therefore, when duty and inclination conflict, the latter is obeyed. Now, my own experience is that, in questions of right and wrong, their decisions are quicker and more correct    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6869-00000071"/> "O      IN THE RAPIDS. than ours. They go at once to the point, whilst we tarry to discuss it. I pray you not to think me too bold in fathoming, or attempting to fathom, your thoughts, but I dare to say you are restrained as much by a chivalric idea of adherence to a pledge from which, in all probability, you ought to feel released, as by the romantic ideas which attend and follow an early and no matter how unreasonable an attachment. I beg you to excuse my earnestness. I am not prying into your secrets. I am very far from asking you to reveal them. I hope I am not venturing too far in flattering myself that you would not be altogether loth to permit me to assist in shaping your future if the past were forgotten. I am sure I am doing no more than justice to your strength of mind and elevated principles, in predicting that there will be no past when it becomes your duty to forget it." He stopped; but I made no reply. I was much affected by the earnestness of his manner, and hesi- tated to speak for that very reason; for I wanted to act with my mind perfectly uncontrolled, if possible. He continued,-  "Your very hesitation might convince you, Miss Cora, that, if you could only once master it, the scru- pulousness which obtains with you now, where it is so unreasonable,-pardon me if I use too strong a term,- would be the surest bond of your safety, your happi- ness, in the future." I was still without the power of replying, but was not conscious of a desire to combat his arguments. We proceeded in silence for awhile. He suddenly   IN THE RAPIDS.       14  leaned over and caught my bridle, stopping my horse at the same instant with his own. Turning towards him to learn the cause of this, I saw his other hand raised with a gesture imposing silence. At the same instant I detected a slight noise, as of dry leaves or brambles disturbed by a person who had stopped and was changing position. It was approaching night- fall, and we were still in a dense portion of the woods, though but a very short distance from the house. The noise appeared to be close beside us, but, owing to the gloom ,of the increasing dusk, we could not see a great way in among the trees. After listening, and hearing nothing more, we started on again. But, Mr. Baxter suddenly stopping both of the horses, we heard footsteps very distinctly in the woods close beside us. My companion instantly dismounted and ran in their direction. Whoever it was hastened away, for I could hear the sounds made by two persons running. The leaves which covered the ground were very dry, and the woods thereabouts were full of low undergrowth. I felt alarmed at first, but was soon reassured by seeing Mr. Baxter returning, tugging along little Paul Victor by the hand. "Do you know," said he to me, in French, "I think this little scamp has been following us for some time, and by instruction? I cannot otherwise iiagine why he should want to tonceal himself or run away." We endeavored to make him explain what he had been about; but he resolutely put his hands behind him and backed up against a tree, shutting his mouth, and would not open it tQ speak for either threats or    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6869-00000072"/> "2      IN THE RAPIDS. solicitations. Not being suspicious of the child I supposed it probable that he had sought me to get a ride, as he did once before, and had been restrained by the presence of my companion. Upon offering this explanation to Mr. Baxter, he dismissed his own sur- mises, or seemed to do so, and, setting the little fellow cn the horse before him, we proceeded onward. Having but a short distance yet to go before reaching the house, the subject which had previously engaged us was not further alluded to. As we were emerging from the woods, I observed Mrs. Victor come out in another direction, walking very rapidly, and pass behind the farther end of the house. She presented herself at the hall-door as we were entering, her bonnet and shawl off, with a book in her hand closed over one finger, as if she had just temporarily suspended the reading of it. This was the first act of duplicity I had ever noticed in her. I could not but reflect upon it; but it soon passed from my thoughts, as I had sufficient without it to engage my attention. Mr. Baxter showed no in- clination to remain. I did not press him; and so we parted for the evening. After tea, my father desired me to attend him in the parlors, in order-to read some papers for him. I had frequently done this since my mother's illness, but always before in a little office at the rear of the house where he generally received his tenants and others having business with him. I read over, accordingly, several written papers and lists of figures, understand- ing but little the purport of any of them. Upon getting through what he had handed me, I turned to know if * I   --T he had anything further, when I found he had fallen asleep. I have rarely mentioned my, father in this recital, for reasons some of which may be inferred. That he never possessed my cordial affection is obvious. His face now presented a haggard, care-worn look, and he sighed deeply two or three times. These indica- tions of trouble warmed me to him somewhat: so, in- stead of leaving him, as was my first impulse, I picked up a partly-finished piece of worsted-work which I had left in the room on a previous occasion, and re- sumed my seat. I was soon startled from the busy thoughts which crowded my mind by loud, irregular rapping at the hall-door knocker; and immediately after I heard Mr. Brandon's voice in the hall. I instantly sprang up, and endeavored to retreat by a door which led out under the stairs; but, either from nervousness or from some defect in the latch, I could not open it. As there were no lights in the back parlor, where I now was, I hoped to escape notice until the unwelcome visit should end. My father still slept, notwithstanding the loud rapping. Mr. Brandon entered, glanced partially around the room, and then walked over towards my father. The candles on the table threw their light full on his face; and I saw at once that he was more or less intoxicated. "Halloo, old boy! what are you about?". he cried, giving my father a powerful slap on the back. "Come! wake up here, and let's look at you." My father started up and stared wildly about him. The expression of alarm in his countenance changed    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6869-00000073"/> "4      IN THE RAPIDS. to a miserable smile as he finally succeeded in arousing himself, and recognized his visitor. "Oh, ah! young man!" said he, "you've come, have you? Cora was here just now. I will go find her." And he left the room. This, then, was to be a prearranged interview with me. I was still fumbling at the door, determining, if I could get out, to go and hide. The gentleman ex- amined himself in the mirror on the mantel, ran his hands through his hair, and then sat down to the fire. But, suddenly getting up again, he began striding up and down, and finally, extending his promenade into the back room, came plump upon me. My appear- ance discomposed him a little, but, making a desperate attempt at one of Mr. Baxter's bows, he said,- "Good-evening, my lady--Miss Darwin. Hiding, were you? Very queer, very queer indeed! Only some of your fun, I suppose, though. I have come round expressly by the old gentleman's invitation, to have a little social talk, to come to an understanding. But it is infernally uncomfortable over here in this dark corner. Come, let's take a seat over by the fire and have things snug." This style of talk would have indicated his condi- tion, if I had had no other evidence; for whenever he was sober he made himself ridiculous by running into the opposite extreme when talking to me, using the most extravagantly flowery language, as a rule, though inevitably lapsing into some vulgarism of phrase or idea at every turn. To what he had said I made no reply. I remained standing, with my arms folded, and   IN THE RAPIDS.       145 my face wearing an expression, as near as I could make it, of rigid unconsciousness of his presence. My manner appeared to recall him a little to himself. "Now, Miss Cora, really I think I ought to apolo- gize for the familiar mode in which I took the liberty of addressing you, but I know it will gratify you to forgive me. Do, now, permit me to enjoy the pleasure of conducting you to a seat. I have something really interesting to communicate to you." Then, as if the effort to regain his proper senses had subsided, he added, almost without changing his tone,- "Look here, sissy! I come here to have some chat with you, and I'm going to have it. I don't care who you are; I'm tired; and don't keep me standing up any longer than you can help." I-would have made my way out of the room, but I was afraid he would lay his hands on me if I attempted it, and I could not pass him without getting within his reach. I still remained silent, knowing if I once undertook to answer him he would commence an argument which would last till daylight or until he got sober. He was about to proceed in his tasteful speech, when my father came in. He turned from me and met him, and- they conversed awhile-the one in a deprecatory tone; frequent oaths was all I could dis- tinguish from the other. I now succeeded in undoing the door, but, after egress was open to me, I concluded it was best to know beyond mistake what was in- tended, and to put an end to it at once. If I. escaped this time, I should be in constant dread of a renewal of the trouble. I did not doubt that an appeal to my I3    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6869-00000074"/> "6      IN THE RAPIDS. father might rid me of this person, in his present con- dition; but, as I had maintained myself thus far so well, I determined to wait to the end, under the most advantageous circumstances to the other side, and leave no doubt, if possible, of the power of my firm- ness. My father retired, and closed the door. Mr. Brandon returning to me, then, in the most high- flown, overstrained language, made a proposition of .marriage, to which I replied,- "I have no other feeling towards Mr. Brandon than of absolute, incurable disgust. He will be able to comprehend from this the folly of the course he is pursuing, and at once abandon it." It was my design to leave him immediately, but even while I was speaking, and before the purport of my words appeared to pass into his excited brain, he fell upon his knees and seized one of my hands, com- mencing, "Upon my honor I adore you-" I jerked my hand, which he was tightly squeezing, away from him, and sprang backwards against the door, closing it again, unfortunately. His hold upon my hand had, no doubt, supported him in the position he assumed, and, my sudden withdrawal of it pulling him forward, he fell sprawling on the floor. I gave way to a fit of laughter in spite of myself. He started to his feet, the flush of rage bursting from his face, and, throwing him- self almost upon me, he exclaimed, while he shook his fist in my face,- "D-n me, sissy, if I don't cure your disgust! I'll show you a thing or two!" My father came into the room af the instant, and '?  '  -       - .   IN THE RAPIDS.       147 hurried towards us with uplifted hands, saying, "Come, come, young man!"Mr. Brandon, turning towards him, pushed him aside, and, crying, "Get out of my way, old stick-in-the-mud," strode out of the apart- ment. My father followed him out, and I retreated to my bed-chamber. Although much disturbed by what had just occurred, I turned nry thoughts towards Mr. Baxter, determining to make up my mind with regard to him before re- tiring. I examined every argument he had presented to me, the review being frequently interrupted by my falling into reveries, which I was in no haste to discon- tinue, because I felt that indulgence in them might soon be forbidden. My mother's evident wishes, her failing health, and the faith I always had in her opin- ions, weighed powerfully upon my inclinations. The singular threat made by Mr. Brandon was not over- looked. That he had some influence over my father was evident. I had thought upon it before, but to no purpose. The affair of this evening, of course, caused me to examine it more thoroughly than ever, but, for the life of me, I could make no advance towards an ex- planation of it. How it could be brought to bear upon me to the extent intimated by the man's lan- guage, I did not even undertake to consider, though I could not forget what he had said. I believed him wicked enough for anything. That I would be rid of his persecution in the disgusting shape in which it first presented itself, and be amply protected against it in any shape, by becoming Mr. Baxter's wife, was an obvious conclusion.    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6869-00000075"/> "8   -    N THE RAPIDS. Even at this day, when I ask myself what would have been the result if any one of the several con- siderations I have mentioned had been omitted, I am unable to answer. Certain it is, I asked my heart nothing. I did not look into it. What would I have seen but the image of Laurence Manning? It is there now. I had a clear conception of the sacredness and the obligations of marriage. Once a wife, I would respect the one and fulfil the other without variableness or the shadow of turning. Reserving one thing, I put away further discussion with myself. I resolved that a further appeal to me would not go unsatisfied: I would not consent to go -  to Europe and leave my mother. I would not defer the marriage, but I would rather part with my husband for a time, than have my only parent that I could think of as such, die in my absence. But my resolve was yet unspoken; and why could I not spend another hour with my precious heart- memories, before parting with them forever? The record, so frequently mentioned, filled half the pages of a large, gilt-edge, tuck memorandum-book. It had my name in several places on the fly-leaves, and the first two or three pages were taken up with an attempt at a journal which I had undertaken to keep of my school life, but which I neglected after the first week. This book, since my return, lay always on a table in my room. The room itself was in charge of an old West-India-born colored woman, named rherese, who had nursed both my mother and myself. y   She was borne down with the weight of years passed in our service, but was still vigilant, and it would have been as easy to carry the house away bodily as for any one, save my mother, to get into my room when I was out of it. She had an odd habit of poking herself into out-of-the-way corners, and wandering up and down in the dark ends of passages, and at times it was out of the question to find her by any ordinary means; but a footstep at the threshold of my door as surely biought her forth, as the lamp of Aladdin did the Genius. She had grown cross in her latter days, even to me, and some of her notions about the arrangement of things in my room were very annoying at times. But I could not be cross with her. She had smoothed my first pillow, and, in her eyes, I had never ceased to be a child. Peace to her ashes! Her lot was humble, but all its duties were faithfully discharged. With this devoted old creature as its guardian, then, I took no care of anything in my chamber. When I entered it this evening, I had closed, but did not fasten,  the door. After reaching the conclusion I have related, I took up the book and read the conversations through. As I followed word after word over the pages, the occasion of writing them came back to me with a vividness not one whit short of the reality. My always too active imagination intensified every cir- cumstance, actuated by a vague fancy that, although they were going to be dismissed forever, still there was a possible time and state of things beyond that, when they might be recalled, and so they must be brought into strong light and renewedly impressed on /        *I3    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6869-00000076"/> 150       IN THE RAPIDS. the memory, preparatory to being altogether erased from it! Reading that which I had written of what I had said myself, recalling some words which I had not written, and imagining what I would now say in like circumstances, I passed from thought to' speech. I fancied that Laurence was listening to me,--was in the room beside me. I was proudly developing some of the ideas which I had heard him utter, but which I could not then understand, showing how much my mind had expanded, how much nearer it was to his. He talked no more, however, in -the. severe strain which sometimes so grieved me. He spoke only of the depth and endurance of his love, or of that cruel season when harsh voice n gty 6&amp;tenance. We did not go uteevery turn, only to grieve tha t  it hadev w  not been passed in te   ail the eto the ltar ich which was our s now beyond p ith feradv enture. Th d churchwas  nolights, the orgsame sr outthdin gr wast music I ever heard, only it was gra till when we were coming out. And there was a crowd of little children in the church, about the altar, and blocking u  our w ent we tried to reach the door to go out, and they alltar, looked so happy. They alone of all in the church appeared to be as happy as we were. "Now, Laurence," said I, as we got into the car- riage, "there is to be no more parting on this earth!"   IN THE RAPIDS.       15  The energy with which I made this exclamation brought me to myself. The cold reality came back upon me in such sudden transition that, despite the utmost exertion to prevent it, I burst into tears. Once they started, however, I no longer endeavored to restrain them, but gave way still more, sobbing con- vulsively, burying my face in my hands on the open book before me. As I felt no disposition to interrupt this outhurst, I took no notice of its duration. Finally, however, raising my head, and accidentally glancing into the cheval-glass before me, I saw the reflection of Mrs. Victor's face looking over my shoulder. I sprang up, astonished and angry. Quickly as I had turned upon her, she was several feet away and standing erect. She said, quite calmly, "I tapped before entering, and I understood you to say, 'Come in.'" At the same moment I heard the shuffling feet of old Therese at the door. Her bandanna headkerchief made its appearance, and then, her'dear old face slowly turning upwards from the position in which her bent figure required her to carry it, she asked,- "Meess Cora, you een dere?" and, giving a satisfied "umph!" as her eyes answered her inqui4y, she slowly retired. I informed Mrs. Victor, in the gentlest lan- guage I could summon, that I had not heard her rap, did not bid her come in, and that I wished to be alone. The following morning I felt quite indisposed, and, though rising at the usual hour, I could not remain up, and threw myself on my bed shortly after break- -ast. Little Paul came into the room whilst I was    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6869-00000077"/> 1 52      W TZHE RAPIDS. there, and, after trying to amuse him for awhile with trifling talk, I left him to himself, and soon forgot his presence, until I heard :the rustling -of some papers on my table, under which I had thrfust i- memorandum-book after Mrs. Victor's visit thpe Fi j --  vious evening.  I could not observe him;,-:ing down as I was, but, sitting up very quietly, I saw`him just as he laid his hand on tile book. He turned his face towards the bed at the instant, still keeping his hand where it was, but when he caught me looking at him he quickly withdrew it and made a very good pretence of playing with an empty cologne-bottle which was on the table. Not caring to let him know that I had detected him, I got up, took a book, and sat at the table reading until he went out, of his own accord, which he did not do for more than an hour. As he went away, old Therese made her appearance. She busied herself adjusting the room for some time, saying nothing, however, until she got through, though I saw she nad something to tell me. As she got near the door to go away, she turned towards me    and said,--  "Meess Cora, dat wooman peep in yo' keyhole. Take care dat wooman,--dat chile too." She then shuffled away, without listening whether I intended replying to her or not. I am  naturally unsuspicious, and in what now had come to my knowledge of the strange conduct of the widow and of her child acting in concert with her I saw nothing but the promptings of extravagant curi- osity. That she ever expected to attract the serious   attention of Mr. Baxter, or was }'capable of malicious enmity towards efoeeing in her way, might have entered my mind, utif so, it soon passeduf it.

I ought to have destroyed it at this tim, because I fully intended never more to look inft&amp;t; but, instead of doing so, I put it in one of the trunks which I had had at school with me. This trunk was the only thing in the apartment of which the lock had a key. It con- tained my school-books, and the shawl and bonnet which I wore on the evening of my going to the church with Laurence. After locking it, on this occasion, I put the key in a small reticule that I nearly all the time carried about with me.  d    <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6869-00000078"/> CHAPTER XI. jM  R. BAXTER called that evening after tea. Mrs. Victor followed me into the parlors to see him. He at once very quietly and politely requested her to allow him a few moments' private conversation with me. She retired, of course, but with the air of a per- son who had been flagrantly affronted. He renewed his proposal, without the slightest circumlocution, and I, with equal directness, expressed my consent to be- come his wife. To the qualification which I added of refusing to go to Europe with him, and giving him the choice of having the marriage take place before his departure. or after his return, he said,- "That is indeed a severe disappointment. But the reason you assign is more than sufficient. I was not aware of your mother's state of health. I will not think of deferring the ceremony until my return. My stay may be very much protracted; and will you not so far make amends for not going as to permit our marriage to be somewhat hastened? If you will name two weeks from to-day, I think I can promis myself to spend the honeymoon at home." To this I could offer no objection, and it was so arranged. To allay any offence which the widow might have taken at being gotten rid of, he begged me to have her sent for, which I did. He was the ( I54)   IN THE RAPIDS.       155 most carefully kind man I ever saw, as this little act will go to show. He remained until quite a late hour, and was unusually entertaining, and seemed very happy. He gave us some amusing scenes from his travels, and sang several delightful songs to Mrs. Vic- tor's or my playing. As he was leaving, he said to me, "My folks are on the point of moving into the city; but I must detain them for these two weeks." He passed the entire next day with us, bringing with him his mother and sisters, to whom he had im- parted the news of our engagement. They expressed their gratification in unmeasured terms. It was, fre- quently alluded to during the day, and became known throughout the house. Mother was very much en- livened, and her health gave indications of improve- ment, though it was only temporary. She took upon herself all the directions about the wedding and my. wardrobe; and certainly they could not have been left in more fitting hands. Mr. Baxter came every morning and afternoon, and spent nearly every evening with us. Twice during the first week I visited the Catons. On the second occa- sion I did not return until it was. quite dark. The windows of the apartment which I occupied as a bed- room since my return from school were in view from the direction which we took in returning. As we ap-  proached the house, I observed that the room was lighted up. As I was looking at it, the shadow of a woman's figure was thrown on the curtains by some one passing between them and the light. It was not    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6869-00000079"/> 156      IN THE RAPIDS. Therese, for, although the shadow was enlarged, I could have distinguished her peculiar head-dress. Moreover, the motion was too quick for her or for my mother. In an instant after the passing of the shadow the light was extinguished. This singular circum- stance annoyed and alarmed me. Leaving Mr. Baxter in the hall, where Mrs. Victor joined him before I got out of hearing, I hastened up to the room. I found Therese slowly shuffling up and down the passage which led to it, mumbling to herself. I did not ques- tion her; for I knew she could not be aware of what I had seen. Opening the door, it pushed against a chair which had been placed with the back towards and close to the door. Making my way to the table, I found that the extinguisher on one of the candles which I took up to light was yet warm. I had just commenced to use a fire for the .season; and when I lighted the candle I found a partly-burned spill on the, hearth. Across the chair at the door was one of my dresses. It was plain that it had been used to prevent light from passing through the keyhole, as well as at the bottom of the door. I was satisfied that Lhe person must still be in the room, and that it must )e a woman; and so, calling in Therese, more to keep ne in countenance than to assist or protect me, I ;earched under the bed, in the wardrobes, and in the :upboards, of which there was one in each end of the :himney wall. Nobody was to be found. It was in- xplicable. I was now really terrified; for I began to hink that some evil-designing person had access to my oom by means which were beyond my control. No-    -J1 thing could be done just then about it. Therese ap- peared to think that my search was for some missing article of clothing; and I did not undeceive her. I re- turned down-stairs, but did not mention the matter to any one, in order not to create needless alarm, inasmuch as I thought it possible to' explain it to myself before it became necessary to retire. As I entered the par- lors, Mr. Baxter observed my disturbed look, and asked if I did not feel unwell. Mrs. Victor's back was turned at the moment; but upon hearing this ques- tion she came towards me, examined my face with great solicitude, and begged I would allow something to be done for me. As I wanted to divert attention from myself, I made a strenuous effort to regain my equanimity. Mr. Baxter exerted himself unusually to divert me, and the widow eclipsed herself in assisting him. She sang, and induced us to sing. She opened a new budget of anecdotes, and so diverted us with her powers of mimicry that we laughed, both of us, until we cried. All of this was very well until I was about to go to bed. As I was parting with Mr. Baxter on the porch, I concluded to ask him to spend the night with us, telling him I had been alarmed, but not mentioning in what manner; and to this he cheerfully consented. I entered my own room in great trepidation. I did not extinguish the lights for half the night. After saying my prayers, I put them out, and sat before the dying embers of the fire for two or three hours more; but, though frequently startled by slight noises which I could account for, nothing unusual occurred. 'Finally, " *                       *    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6869-00000080"/> g58      vIN THE RAPIDS. towards daylight, I lay down without undressing, and obtained a few hours of disturbed sleep. I arose at the usual hour, and found Mr. Baxter ready with his horse and my own for a ride. It was a glorious morn- ing, and, revived by the fresh, cool air, my spirits re- covered for the time from the effects of alarm and fatigue. It may be a circumstance hardly worth alluding to, but I observed that, from the evening on which he obtained my consent, Mr. Baxter never men- tioned the subject of our approaching marriage, ex- cept so far as it was necessary to Consult me in regard to some of the arrangements. I am inclined to think it was because he was aware my feelings were not sufficiently enlisted in it, and that too much dwelling on it might arouse anew the ideas he had had so much difficulty to overcome. In fact, his chief aim seemed to be to divert me; and he certainly succeeded in making the time pass very delightfully. I was really cheerful, and looked forward to a future, if not of the extravagant joy which I once dreamed it would be, at least of fair content and peace in the society of the honored and honorable man who was about to become my husband. On this morning our ride was long, because we started earlier than usual. Our return through our place was over a road on the top of a ridge, at the bottom of which was another road, nearly parallel with the one we were on, but diverging from it farther back and leading to the village where Mr. Brandon resided. We could overlook this lower road, except where the trees were too thickly growing. We were at a sandy place in the road we were on, so that   IN THE RAPIDS.       159 our horses could not be heard, when we observed a horse, fastened among the trees on the farther side of the lower road, and then, coming to a sudden opening among the trees on the side of the ridge, we saw a man and woman talking earnestly together, imme- diately below us. A nearer approach showed it to be Mr. Brandon and Mrs. Victor! The earnestness, how- ever, appeared to be chiefly on the part of the woman. The man, while measurably attentive to her speech, seemed to interpolate a word now and then with an expression which, if possible, increased my disgust for him. We were walking our horses at the time, but even at that gait we soon passed the cleared space on the side of the ridge which -enabled us to see them. But, at the last instant, I thought I saw him about to lay his hands upon her, she raising hers forbiddingly at the action. This may have been a wrong im- pression, as the lower branches of the smaller trees were already intervening, and my own motion gave an apparent relative movement to them, which I possibly mistook. We got but a momentary sight of them, anyhow. Stealing a glance at Mr. Baxter, to ascertain if he had noticed them, I saw a regretful smile passing from his face, and he at once resumed the conversation which had been for a time suspended. The alarm into which I had been thrown by the appearance of the strange light and strange figure in my room had by no means subsided, and under its influence I looked for danger from every quarter. A, succession of disquieting thoughts occupied me until we reached the house. At the breakfast-table I was ; f -    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6869-00000081"/> 166 O  V   IN THE RAPIDS. frequently absent-minded, and, altogether, acted in such a way that Mr. Baxter parted from me with a more dejected air than I had ever seen him have before. I had concluded not to go out again during the day, but to remain at home and keep a watch on my apart- ment. However, he came in the afternoon, and, urging me to ride, I changed my purpose, with a view of reassuring him, as I remembered my strange be- havior of the morning, which to him was inexplicable. Some delay occurred in getting my horse, which I had directed to be allowed to run out. Before starting, I took a careful survey of things about my room. I unlocked my trunk and found my book just where I had laid it. This was rather an instinctive precaution than one which I could give myself any sound reason for observing. After relocking the trunk, I put the key back in my reticule, which I hung on my arm and took along with me. We went over our ride of the morning. I made a strong effort to throw off all appearance of disquiet. Having once concluded on our marriage, I determined that no conduct of mine which I could control should overcast its approach. I succeeded, then, on this occasion, in restoring my companion's good humor, which, in turn, affected my own spirits, and we took the way homeward as gleeful a couple as ever rode together. Just as we struck the path on the ridge, we heard the sound of a horse coming at rapid speed over the lower road. He passed us in two or three minutes afterwards, but, as trees intervened, we   IN THE RAPIDS.       16i were unable to make out the rider, though the horse's feet were for an instant visible through an opening in the undergrowth. The road in the direction he was taking led directly to our house. I felt great anxiety to know who he was. If I had been alone, it would have gone hard with me but I would have overtaken him. For reasons already given, I did not endeavor to inspire my companion with my wish to do so. Moreover, I had not reached--and really never ex- pected to reach-that degree of close intimacy with him which is necessary to the rapid interchange of half-formed thoughts and the moving to action of two persons by the same impulse. We therefore proceeded without changing pace, ind reached, in probably twenty minutes, a point where the trees on each side of the road were unusually small, so that the branches from either side did not interlace, as was mostly the case elsewhere. As the descent was quite steep here, I could see, when we first attained this opening, over the trees whose overlapping arms, still clad in the red leaves of autumn, enshrouded the road beyond. The house was in sight, and my windows were in view, though in a less direct line and at-a greater distance from me than was the case when I observed the light through them on the previous evening. It was not quite so late, either, though the delay in obtaining my horse made it later than it would otherwise have been, and the rapidly thickening dusk was upon us. I looked instinctively at my windows, and there was the light as before! I involuntarily checked my horse for an instant, and then urged him forward, so as to escape the I4*    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6869-00000082"/> 162      IN THE RAPIDS. observation of my companion. We plunged the next moment into the dark portion of the road, and the house was, for the time, lost'to view. Speedily emerging, however, entirely from among the trees, my eyes, which I kept or endeavored to keep on a line with my windows, met the light beaming from those of the room overhead, which was occupied by Mrs. Victor. Presently the shadow of a figure crossing the light was thrown on the curtains as before; but the shadow, owing to the different distance of the light from the person, was of different size, and I could not, at the instant, make the comparison between them. Was I mistaken yesterday? Was the light then, as it is now, in Mrs. Victor's room instead of mine? What of the dress on the chair? I might have thrown it there myself, and Therese have overlooked it. Was the chair as close to the door as I imagined? As to the spill, partly burned, on the hearth, was it, or not, the one which I had used in lighting the candle? for I did not see it until after I had a light. Where was the one I had used, if that one was not it? I could not remember seeing but the one. I might have thrown it into the fire; but, in my present frame of mind in regard to the\ affair, I doubted if I had done so, and could not remember. There remained only the warm extinguisher to be disposed of. I only had the sense of feeling to depend on, because I could not recollect that there was any of the usual smell of a recently-burned wick when I uncovered the candle. I could not say positively that it was very warm, and, for that matter, everything in the room was more or   IN THE RAPIDS.       163 less so, from the fact of the door and windows being closely shut and a fire having burned in it for a consider- able time. The heat of the extinguisher, then, might be owing to this cause, especially as my hands were cold when I came in. I would go at once to the room, and if I found things undisturbed I would straightway dis- miss the subject from my thoughts. I immediately ascended, finding Therese in the passage, opened the door, lit a candle, and looked around. There was not the slightest sign of anything having been disturbed. My old nurse had been in at the usual time to make the fire, which she believed that no one could make to suit me but herself. The hearth had been swept clean by the goose-wing, which was the only thing she would admit to be fit for the purpose. I almost laughed aloud at my foolish fears. It could not be any harm, however, to take another peep into my trunk, although I felt ashamed at the thought of doing so, and fancied myself more like a silly child who puts her toy under the pillow and feels a dozen times before she goes to sleep if it has not flown away, than a woman who was to be married the next week. I would look, anyhow. As I was taking the key from my reticule, a servant came to say that mother wanted me immediately. I dropped the key back in its place, and hastened to her at once. I found her laboring under excitement, which her contracted brow, the unusually rigid lines of her face, and a pained, anxious look from her eyes, showed she was endeavoring to suppress or conceal. After a few ,moments of silence, she said,-    <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6869-00000083"/> I64      IN THE RAPIDS. "My child, your father-I duly informed of your ap- proaching marriage, as a matter of form. There are reasons, which you doubtless have seen ere this, why I, in some things, have never thought proper to permit his judgment to influence me. The disposal of your hand is one of them. I have always observed to him, however, such a show of proper respect that the world has never known, and, by anything I shall do or say, never shall know, that he does not deserve it. Although I believe he had some intimation of it before I imparted it to him, he expressed not only swrprise, but determined opposition. As I have always carried my point with him, however, no matter with what stubbornness he resisted in the beginning, I gave myself no concern about his feelings on this one. Had I only his mind to contend with, the struggle would have ended already. Do not be alarmed, Cora. It will terminate in my way ultimately. But listen. "That unfortunate man, young Brandon, has ac- quired some kind of a hold upon him, as you already know, from what you told me; and my husband must: surely be going mad to dream of such a sacrifice as that of my child to such a creature. Now he comes to me daily, since that wretched affair in the parlors the other evening, and some days two or three times, with new arguments in the man's favor, and especially with reiterated statements of the terrible consequences to him if he fails to propitiate him. He has just left me, after a scene which it required all my firmness, and which has drawn largely on my remaining stock of health, to withstand. This trouble, whatever it is,   IN THE RAPIDS.       165 moves him terribly. He never could talk much; and I cannot induce him to summon language or courage- whichever is needed-to explain this matter to me. "He besought me on his knees to have the-wedding postponed for a few weeks, adding the strange remark that a postponement was all that he would ask. Now, what meaning is to be attached to that, I do not know. But it bodes no good. This man Brandon I believe to be fully capable of some villanous machination against you. But, as delay seems to be necessary to whatever is intended, delay therefore must not be listened to. It is so unfortunate that my health and strength should be leaving me exactly at what seems to be the most critical period in your life! Hand me a glass of water, child: I am almost out of breath." I obeyed her, and, after taking a few sips, she re- clined a moment or so on the pillow, from which she had risen when I entered. She then proceeded. "Now, I have sent for you to guard you against suggesting any delay, or permitting any one to persuade you to it. And that brings up almost the main object I had in sending for you. Your father dropped the idea, by a set of words which I find it impossible to recall, that some of the reasons urged by him were suggested by Mrs. Victor. It was only my inference, and he refused to admit it when I questioned him. But I must guard you at all points. I think your principal erred in sending me the woman. I had a slight antipathy to her in the beginning, which has not by any means diminished. Be guided by her in nothing. Avoid her, if you can, for the few days which remain. I do    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6869-00000084"/> i66      IN THE RAPIDS. not know what has induced me to retain her so long, unless it is pity for her forlorn situation. Now, go; child; there is the tea-bell; and forget nothing that I have told you." The widow joined us at the tea-table, but not with her ordinary promptness. She was a little thoughtful at entering, but soon regained her usual flow of spirits. As the evening wore on, she seemed to have a very riot of joy. She laughed at everything, both in and out of season, but in a peculiar, triumphant, and im- pertinent tone, that not only made her ridiculous, but cauised me to feel uncomfortable for more reasons than one. Several of her bursts of ill-timed laughter were discharged straight in my face. Mr. Baxter was much annoyed and troubled. He looked at her with the pained and pitying expression with which a benevolent person of good sense regards an insane creature. She succeeded in making me feel very unhappy. Mother's advice and my own previous observations were recol- lected with renewed force. She finally carried her strange behavior so far, that I, fearing fhat one more step would make me forget myself, said to her,- "Mrs. Victor, you have too long forgotten your position here. Please quit the room. You cannot remain any longer in the house than is necessary for your preparations to leave it. If it can be early to- morrow, I shall be obliged to you." She threw her head back and broke into an immod- erate laugh, but checked herself in the middle of it. Her face became suddenly blanched with that pallor of anger which I believe generous natures never ex-   IN THE RAPIDS.       I67 hibit, and her eyes became suddenly congested. She was about to speak, and I expected a torrent of abuse,: when Mr. Baxter, who had been slowly walking towards her, said to her, looking her straight in the eyes, and speaking in a firm, sharp tone, which con- veyed more meaning than his language, "Mrs. Victor, I leave to-morrow for the city by the first train; and I will 'all for you." At the same moment a servant came t the door and beckened me into the hall, say- ing that mother was taken violently ill. Bidding Mr. Baxter good-night, I was hurrying away, when he, observing my distressed look, and learning the cause, determined to remain in order to go for a physician, if one were needed. On my way to mother's I passed my own rooms, and, dismissing Therese, locked my door and took the key alongP with me. I expected, probably, to remain up all n,.1 ., and, feeling that everything was secure so far, I would take no further risks on any point. It was well that Mr. Baxter did remain. Mother had been taken with a haemorrhage, and the presence of a physician was indispensable.    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6869-00000085"/> CHAPTER    XII. \/M OTHER became worse as the night wore on, and the physician, whom Mr. Baxter had hur-  ried from across the river to her assistance, gave me  but little hope that she would ever rally. Blood came from her in mouthfuls. at intervals, and every drop seemed to increase her weakness. After midnight, however, the haemorrhages were less frequent, and the quantity, at each successive time, was smaller. Towards daylight the doctor gave us some hope. I did not realize, until the prospect of her getting better began to appear and my anxiety to decrease, how painful would be my own situation if she were to die at this time. I did not leave her nor close my eyes in sleep for five days and nights. She must suffer not the slightest excitement, nourishment must be given her in stated quantities and at regulated intervals, and her potions must be carefully administered day and night. None of these things would I trust to any one but myself; and so my attendance was incessantly required, even if my anxiety would have allowed me to quit her. Mr. Baxter had gone away on the morning succeeding her attack, taking charge of Mrs. Victor and her hope- ful boy on their way to the city, as he had promised. He came thereafter twice daily, as usual, remaining during the evening, until a late, hour, in mother's little ( 68) 4   y         AXIN THE RAPIDS.     169 library, which adjoined her bedroom, reading nrtuch of the time by a shaded light, occasionally quietly steal- ing into the sick-room and exchanging a word or two with me in a whisper. He assisted me in some trifling things, and his solicitude, attention, and the almost feminine gentleness which he displayed during these trying days, served to win him more of my good feel- ing than any quality of his character with which I had previously become familiar. Whatever more glittering attributes may do towards attracting us in the heyday land sunshine of youth and hope, the man who can be patient with our weakness, and teaches us that he has a gentle hand for our day of suffering, cannot fail to ! reach our affections when once the adverse storms of life have shaken our faith in our strength, and prepared us to know that with our sex endurance is the first of virtues. It was on Thursday evening that mother was taken so ill. That day one week had been appointed for the marriage; but, important as such a circumstance gen- erally is in a woman's life, it passed entirely from my mind from the moment the servant announced her illness to me until the following Monday morning, when the doctor, arriving early, gave her authority, at her request, to converse a few moments, when the first thing she said was that the ceremony must not be postponed on account of her illness. Mr. Baxter, who had arranged with the doctor to make his visit and report her situation to him before he left each morn- ing for the city, heard her voice, low as it was, from the library, which had been given up to his use during 15    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6869-00000086"/> 170      IN THEY RAPIDS. her sickness. Quietly stealing into the sick-room, and approaching the bedside, he appebaled to mother, in a few terse, anxious words, to do exactly what she had just announced as her intention. The thought seemed to have occupied both their minds during all the period of their forced silence towards each other. Mother asked the doctor if she could probably sit up or be taken into the library on Thursday, and being-: ,:; assured ,that she might, if no adverse change should,: - - : take place, it was at once arranged to have the cere. -e^ : T mony performed in the library, instead of at church,-;: ls:). was at first designed.            :: Her improvement, though obvious, was still slight, and I would not yet leave her or take any rest. On that evening Mr. Baxter failed to come. On the fol- -lowing Tuesday morning a note came from him, as one always did come when I had reason to expect him and he did not present himself. It: was carefully written, and there was no absence of kind expressions, but there was a peculiar wariness about it, which it would have been difficult to point out to anybody, but of which I could not disabuse my own mindi. He did not come that evening. Mother had changed much for the better during the afternoon, and calling in Therese I stationed her in a big, comfortable arm- chair at the bedside, while I, now completely worn down by watching and fatigue, threw myself beside mother on the bed and slept profoundly the live-long night. My brain was dizzy when I awoke from my long, stupefied sleep. The usual hour of Mr. Baxter's visit had come and gone, and he had not made his ap-    : .    IN THE RAPIDS.       171I pearance, nor had any note come from him. My dresses arrived from the city about the middle of the morning. One of the Catons was to wait on me, and on this very day she was to make me a visit with the gentleman who was to wait upon her brother. Find- ing mother a great deal better, I threw a shawl around me, and, crossing the house, I descended to the parlors, : A. to have a change of air. I still had on the tumbled !.?3;:4:'eSS which I had been wearing the whole week : :-nearly, during night and day, and my hair had not e b-eein properly dressed since mother's sickness. Of course I expected to learn of any arrival in time to prepare for it. I found my wedding-dress laid tempo- rarily on the piano, together with all the other most essential articles of the morrow's toilet (for my room was still closed and I retained the key). I gave them but a passing glance, as my brain was in such terrible dis- order. Drawing a rocking-chair to the fire, I put my feet up on the fender, and fell into a half doze, half reverie,-the tedious, low noises of the sick-room, the ticking of the watch, the chirping and hissing of the firewood still sounding in my ears and making me think I was back in it, until, opening my eyes now and then, I detected the error, only to fall again into it the next minute. Mr. Baxter's strange and continued ab- ence was on my mind, but in my half-conscious state I had only a general idea of some trouble which I could not define, but which seemed rather to haunt me while"I dozed, and to fly away as soon as I opened my eyes. The sound of a horse walking very slowly and stop-    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6869-00000087"/> 172      IN THE RAPIDS.  ping at the porch, and a tap or two at the knocker, were in my mind, as having been either heard or dreamed, when I was completely roused by the par- lor-door opening and presenting Mr. Baxter on the threshold. Conscious of my unpresentable appearance, I felt desirous of retiring, but was so struck by his ex- pression as to forget my purpose. His face was deadly pale, and as he slowly entered he laid his hand on the back of the chairs near him, as if to obtain their sups . port. My first impression was that he had been taken violently sick in the city, and had just recovered suffi- ciently to come and explain his absence. I imme-- diately advanced to meet him as he entered, and gave him my hand. I found his own cold, damp, and trem- bling. I was upon the point of asking about his health, when I got a fair look into his eyes, which he had hitherto turned downwards. I can only describe their look by saying that it was composed of recent fright and present suspicion. As he usually spoke promptly on meeting me, I awaited the breaking of his continued silence, which was not less strange than his look and movement. Without addressing me by any name or term, he said, in a confused voice, while his face seemed to, grow a shade paler, "I have not been home before since Monday morning. On that"afternoon Mr. Cor- nell, my lawyer, sent for me, and put in my hands a pamphlet. Here it is," drawing the thing he alluded to from a side pocket of his coat. "He received it from a person whom he never saw before, but who requested him to read it in my interest, and informed   IN THE RAPIDS.       173 him that every acquaintance of mine in the entire city had been furnished with a copy. During the day a second person called upon him and handed him a manuscript book, saying it was the original, or foun- dation, of the pamphlet." That it was my own record-book he alluded to-that it had, after all, been purloined-I was now, at last, prepared to believe; that some horrible, shocking use had been made of it, I expected to hear him say every instant. I could but look at him and listen. "This manuscript book is yours,-in your hand- writing. Your name is in it. The pamphlet has been verified by comparison on the partt of so many, that the whole city can say, in reading the pamphlet, they read your actual composition." I was staring him fixedly in the face. He seemed confused by my expression, which, whatever else it conveyed, did not represent what it is possible, and I say only possible, he had been led to expect. The beaded sweat rolled from his forehead. He started up and walked away from me, holding his head between his hands, as if he would save it from bursting under the crush of irreconcilable ideas. Suddenly, returning ,to me, he said, speaking very rapidly,- "Every man, and woman too, who knows me,-the whole babbling city has learned-they have been given to understand-some one has made them believe that I am-that I was about to marry a woman unworthy of me--" "Sir!"I cried, stung to the quick, and springing to my feet. I5*    <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6869-00000088"/> 174      IN THE RAPIDS. "For God's sake, say nothing until you hear me through. I have been lashed to distraction by thousands of scorpion tongues. Crazed by the first anguish of this thing, I sent to know if it was be- lieved-what people said. The city rings with my name and yours from end to end. But here is your book," said he, drawing my well-known record from his pocket. "Look at it. There is some villany, I think-I know. But look at it!"And again he strode up and down the floor, uttering words which I some- times heard, but mostly speaking to himself. I had been struggling for the last few moments to trace out the plot against me, by connecting its results, ,not altogether yet revealed to me, with the observa -- tions which I was too slow at making at its inception; but the wretched, distracted look and the violent speech and action of the man before me prevented me from  connecting one thought with another. Taking the book from his hand, I opened it, and found it had been completely filled with writing. The page where what I had written stopped was so familiar to me that I turned at once to it, but the added writing  was so close an imitation of my own that, lstatnding- where it was, I could see no distinction. Going:to one of the windows, I found that even the ink had been  made of the same faded hue. An examination of the new writing, in a strong light, scarcely exhibited, even to my eyes, any appreciable difference. I read a line here and there, and, though the words in some cases were meaningless to me, I got a fair idea of the general purport of the addition made to my own writing. In-   IN THE RAPIDS.       175 censed that what I held so sacred should be thus con- taminated, IJtore out the forged pages, two or three at a time, until they had all fallen upon the floor, and placed the book in my bosom, saying,- "That much is forgery. If you have read the pamphlet, you must know what it includes." And, returning to my seat, we both remained silent for some minutes. Limited as was my experience of the world, I instinctively understood in what a position I was placed before it by the publicity of this book. Even what I had written myself would have been abundant food for scandal; but the forged addition to it admitted of no limit to my obloquy. The magnitude of the trouble, viewed in this light, and the difficulty of applying any speedy remedy, or any effectual one soon or late, compelled me to postpone any considera- tion of it in presece io its effect upon my relation with the individual bifbre me. For Laurence Man- ning to have intimated such aspersions to me with the slightest show of belief, would have crushed me to the earth. As it' was, I was sustained, by the as- suance that he would have spurned them. Whence came this assurance? 'From the consciousness that my love for :lim, though quieted, hushed even, for a brief time, ws not quelled. At this instant, all re- straints that had ever been thrown around it were torn away. I yielded once more fully to its influence. It dispelled the doubt, confusion, and, I almost say, the shame under which I labored, and brought me promptly to the decision that in all probability would    <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6869-00000089"/> 176     IN THE RAPIDS. have been the safest one, no matter what considera- tions had induced it. Mr. Baxter had gone towards the window next to the one at which I had examined the spurious writing. Without looking directly at him, I was aware that he had partly turned and was looking down upon the leaves scattered on the floor. He said, in a calmer tone than he had yet used,- "During my absence, unable to make up my mind how to approach you, I threw myself among my old companions, partly to relieve my distraction, and partly moved by a vague desire to know how this affair had affected them. It only added to the misery which before was more than enough. Every sentence addressed to me or spoken in my presence seemed to be barbed with a latent meaning expressly to cut me to the heart's core. Your own sex was ten times worse than the other. If you had come into the world heralded by an inheritance of their enmity for genera- tions, they could not have been more merciless. Even if you could make your innocence as clear as the noon- day sun -" "Does Mr. Baxter dare to tell me that he harbors a doubt of it?"I asked, quite calmly. "No, before Heaven, I do not! You know how0 sacredly I regard your sex. I value no man's honor who does not share with me in the feeling. Thus for- tified, a world of evidence could not open my breast to the faintest ray of suspicion of the purity which I have set up as my idol. But if you had been brought by angels out of heaven but yesterday, in the face of all   IN THE RAPIDS.       " the world, and the vilest creature of them all were to utter a charge against you, it would find believers. The mass of human minds feed upon depravity. Cloyed with a surfeit of it where it is, they whet their appetites in hunting for it where it is not, or in endeav- oring to create it. With so much baseness to deal with, it will take years to relieve your name from blemish, if it ever be done." I have done ample justice to this gentleman's integ- rity wherever I have had occasion to speak heretofore of his character. But I am compelled to believe that in uttering, as he did -now, so strong a disclaimer of suspicion, he did what he was not prepared to do when he entered the room. I do not charge him with inconsistency; I do not blame him for any misgiving he may have had, nor for expressing it. Standing up, and leaning on the end of the mantel farthest from him, I said,- "It will be some amends to Mr. Baxter for what he has suffered, to know that I do not expect--I hope it will not surprise him to hear that I will not permit-- his name to receive any blemish from mine." "Have I made it understood that I desired any such conclusion from this unfortunate business?" he said, with a look of mingled contrition and anxiety. Without answering his question, I continued: "I have not been moved to this decision either by any doubt of his courage to assist me in living down the obloquy which he acknowledges to be unmerited, or by any abatement of the esteem in which I have gladly learned to hold him. He will admit that he was will-    <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6869-00000090"/> 178       IN T'HE RAPIDS. ing to await the birth of any deeper feeling in my bosom, nor has he pretended that it exists in his own. The absolute, unclouded confidence occupying its place has received a shock which any ordinary inci- dent of married life may show to have been fatal. I cannot consent to expose him or myself to such risk. I speak candidly for both, and I do so with more grief than my calmness imiplies." "My dear lady," he replied, with some agitation, "I will grant that I exhibited no deeper feeling than you describe, but I beg to assure you of its existence. You did not deny that I rightly divined the state of your own heart. Any affectation of a sentiment on my part would have been displeasing; and you were not in a condition to give it the credit of reality." "You professed, sir," I said, "to have made choice of me from calm deliberation. I would like to dis- miss the further use of the word, but love does not deliberate." "It is true, indeed, I deliberated," he continued, his tone continually softening, and his face assuming the persuasive expression which it wore so frequently during our earlier conversations, the effect of it being increased by his paleness and the physical prostration he had suffered. "It is perfectly true that I deliber- ated; but, once having made the choice and being sure of possessing it, I put no restraint upon my feelings." He had been moving slowly towards me. I begged him to take the seat I had vacated, as he was terribly agitated now, and his strength, much exhausted by his previous great excitement during his absence, was   IN THE RAPIDS.       17 still further drawn upon by the rapid transition of feel- ing which he had undergone since he came into the room. "Not an hour has passed, no, not a moment, with- out increasing my enthrallment. Calmly as I have spoken, my brain was busy with dreams of our future life together. Can you not, dear lady, forget the offence which I committed by my violence, when you know, as I now tell you, that it was due to nothing so much as to the strength of my affection? If I did not love you, my course was plain at the first blush of this miserable calumny. Who but a man infatuated with the charms of mind and of person which have enslaved my every faculty would come within their fascination, if he were not prepared to stake any and everything on their pos- session? Pardon me, I beg you, dear lady, this first use of terms, not of flattery, but of honest adulation, which my senses involuntarily pay, and which you must know is more than deserved. A hundred times did I resolve not to trust myself in your presence with this foul adder stinging my brain, but to present my- self only in time to make you my wife, and too late to breathe a word of the agony I suffered." I was surprised at the earnestness with which he spoke; nor could I conceal an expression of sympathy with the mental and physical pain expressed in his upturned face, and which no one could witness un- moved. In his eyes alone was there any physical sign of the eloquence with- which he was pleading. But, moved- as I was, and flattered as I am convinced most women would have been, by such expressions of    <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6869-00000091"/> I 80      IN THE RAPIDS. unqualified devotion from so admirable a man, I longed. to end a discussion that could have but one termina- tion, and that one of my own, unalterable selection. But, mistaking my expression, he was inspired by the near prospect of success, and said, before I could sum- mon my words,- "I am now sure that your obduracy has only been assumed to put me to the test. You can no longer refrain from giving evidence of having relented. You have put me on the rack, and wrung from me a con- fession which I would only have been too happy to repeat every hour of the day, had I but known you desired it." He arose from his seat with a quick, elastic motion, as if filled with new strength, and extended me his hand, which I took in my own, saying,- "I accept it---"And, before I could add another word, he caught my other hand by a sudden, impetu- ous grasp, and, throwing his head back and looking upwards, as if to give fuller outlet to his feelings, he cried, "Joy! joy! once more!" I was so overcome by his excitement, and so pained .-.- by the cruel error into which he had fallen, that I  hung my head in confusion. There was nothing more wanting to his absolute conviction. He drew me towards him, and would have clasped me the next instant in his arms. By a violent effort, I held him from me. With a calmness which it wrung my every fibre to assume, and with all the kindness, not less than all the truth, demanded by the occasion, I completed the sentence he had so impetuously interrupted.    IN THE RAPIDS.       I "I accept it in assurance of the friendship which I will ever heartily return," and added, "The impossi- bility of any feeling beyond that, I have done all I could do to make unmistakably manifest." "Gracious heavens!" he exclaimed, his arms falling nerveless to his sides, and his. hands clinching with agitation. He continued, as if supposing me to be laboring under some unaccountable error, "Why, we were to be married to-morrow! Is not that your wedding-dress? I began to count by hours the time that stood between me and the precious moment when I could address you by the sweet name of wife,- could have folded you in these arms and dared the world to harm you. To be disappointed, to be turned back at the very threshold of happiness, is too much! It is terrible!" He turned away from me, and began pacing up and down the floor. I could find nothing more to say, and would have gone out of the room, as the only means of ending the trying scene; but I doubted my power to do so, worn down as I was by the trouble I felt and witnessed, and I still clung to the mantel for support.  He said, in an upbraiding tone, "Racked as I now am, -and t'dliberately as you have done it all, I see how little you staked upon it. But, I confess, I deceived myself." Again stopping, and turning towards me, he said,- -  "If you dread to meet the people among whom your name has been attacked, go with me and live in Eu- rope,-I have wealth ienough to abandon everything that interests me here,--or give me some hope that " A" . - . 1..6    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6869-00000092"/> 182      IN THE RAPIDS.   , I when I return-and fix it when you please--I-imay. find a place in your heart; or I will break every other,;A tie I have, and we will dwell together here, secluded: from the world, which I own does not deserve to .have you mingle with it." I could only give a gesture of dissent. He con- tinued, - "Why will you so weakly yield to the machina- tions of your-enemies? They knew you and me but too well. For God's sake, drive from you the thought that your name has been, or can be, tarnished,-that mine can ever suffer. They knew it coulliot. They knew by what a slender thread- rimyi I hl up nayou hung,-that to create mistrust would break it. All that was done, was done not that the world would turn against you or against me, but that we should turn- upon each other. I implore you, do not let us yield to this infamy."           - He stopped, but his quick, violent breathing showed it was from exhaustion. In another moment he sud- denly caught up the pamphlet from the floor, and tore it into atoms, exclaiming,- "Why did I bring this damnable thing here?" And then, turning towards me, his hands raised im- ploringly, he cried, "Pardon my violence, my dear lady, but I am distracted. - Oh, this is hard! so hard!" Averting my face, I moved away, nerved up to go by the dread of seeing him lose all control of himself, and not knowing what to expect. Suddenly, following me, he caught my hand, and saying, in a broken, tremulous voice, "This much, this much at least!" he   IN TIIE RAPIDS.       i83 kissed it repeatedly and convulsively, and, before I could withdraw it, it was wet with tears. This action wrung me to the very soul. A feather's weight would have thrown pe into his arms, not relenting, not shaken in my purpose,-for it recalled the impulse under which I had kissed the hand of Laurence Manning,--but in physical yielding to a power which I cannot describe and did not recognize, for it burst upon me in a dizzy whirl of my faculties. Had I yielded, it would not have been in granting love, but to ask for mercy. As it was, folding my arms, possibly for a show of firm- ness which I had not, possibly for the thought of thus retaining, a little longer, my remaining strength, I staggered from the room, to fall upon my knees, and to ask of Heaven not to turn the bitter chalice from my lips, but that it might be remembered in my plea for that peace hereafter which seemed denied to me on earth forever.    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6869-00000093"/> CHAPTER    XIII. M  Y first thought, after regaining some degree of composure, was the necessity of imparting what had occurred to my mother. In her ordinary state of health, it would not have cost me a moment's hesita- tion; but, in her still very precarious condition, I was forced to pause. The hour appointed for the cere- mony was so near at hand, that I knew the subject was the only one on her mind; and it would be out of the question for me to converse with her about it and  conceal what had happened. I had gone once to the room with the view of getting a mere glance at her, intending not to be drawn then into conversation, but to excuse myself for remaining away a time longer, during which I might come to some conclusion as to how I should act with a due regard to truth and her situation. Fortunately, I found her sleeping. Beck- oning Therese out, I learned from her that signs of improvement continued, and that nothing appeared to be required which she could not supply. My father had been in, as he had come daily since her attack, but did not disturb her repose. Telling Therese, then, to say I had gone to my own room to lie down, I left her, and repaired thither. I put the mutilated record-book back in my trunk, taking the occasion to examine the lock, which an- (184)   IN THE RAPIDS.       85 swered readily to its proper key and showed no sign of having been tampered with. It had evidently been carefully picked, or opened with a master key. I gave myself no further trouble about Mrs. Victor's myste- rious means of access to my room, as there was now no one about the house who could have any reason to do me harm. I was no longer doubtful that she had been in it on both evenings. The horseman who passed me so rapidly on the second evening was some one-say Mr. Brandon-bringing the key, or the pick, the need of which probably led to their interview of the morning (agreed upon over-night), as it could hardly be procured short of the city. Having had a fire made up, I threw myself on my bed, to get some rest, though my mind was too full of the duty immediately before it to admit of sleep, much as I yet felt the need of it. I paid no attention to the bells for dinner, and several hours passed away without determining anything, though I must say that my mind was not so obedient as usual to my control, and wandered often to other subjects than the one I desired solely to consider. In the midst of my perplexity, I heard a gentle tap at my door. "It is I, Cora dear," said the voice of the elder Miss Caton. "Will you not let me see you? Please do not t get up if you are resting. But can I not come in?" I called to her to enter. She opened the door, and came over to the bedside and kissed me repeatedly with earnest affection. She was a fresh, lively crea- ture, and I often envied her her practical way of deal- ing with persons and things around her. i6*    <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6869-00000094"/> 186      IN THE RAPIDS. "Now," she said, taking both my hands and folding them in her own, "I do not offer any apology, and you are not going to consider this as an intrusion from me. Do not say anything: I do not intend to let you utter a w6rd. Brother has been home. Do not be alarmed. What transpired this morning, he is satisfied, has ended everything between you. - But you must know that he always thinks for everybody, no matter what his own troubles are; although-poor fellow!-he never knew what trouble was before. "He called at the house this morning, on his way from the city, and told me not to come until he re- turned: you remember I was to call to-day. If he had only said then what was on his mind, I could have saved everything. I could have seen Mrs. Victor in th e whole of it. I watched her manceuvres with Helen, which, by the way, she might have saved herself, for, much as he admired her,-and I think she deserves it,-you would have been his choice without that wretched woman's efforts to damage her in his eyes." She then proceeded to detail how Mrs. Victor, making use of Mr. Brandon, put Helen in the unseemly posi- tion I have elsewhere described, though admitting that it was more from an after-comparison of circumstances than from understanding them as they occurred that she became aware of it, Helen ultimately having con- fessed, in her own defence, the influence and motives which inspired her. She qualified a previous remark which I have repeated, by saying, "Mrs. Victor's interference, while it did not decide brother, gave him an opportunity of acting, as it authorized him to sus-   IN THE RAPIDS.       187 pend, to some extent, the attentions due to Helen as our former guest, according to his extravagant notions of courtesy, and to devote himself more exclusively to you; though your strange and continued avoidance of him caused his declaration to be very abrupt, as it was. You see, he made me his confidante from the day of the fete down to the moment when he most needed me, when, by some strange fatality, he became suddenly reticent. "Thinking, as I have said, for everybody, he would have us come and give- your mother all the comfort we can, under the suffering which must ensue to her from learning what led to the affair of to-day. Mother and sister are with your mother now, prepared to tell her everything, in a way that will least afflict her, if she has not already been informed, and to give her assurance of how little we have been affected by the attempt made to injure you. And he charged one of us to take you away out of the sick-room, if we found you there, and try to divert your mind from the painful feelings which, from many causes, he is sure must occupy it. Now you understand why we came over so soon after brother got home; and I am not going to say another word on-the subject." When I informed her that I had not yet seen mother, and how much embarrassment I was saved by their coming, she was delighted at this effect of their visit. She removed the interdict against my talking, and we passed the rest of the day as agreeably as was possible to me under the circumstances. Joining the others in mother's room a short while before their departure,    <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6869-00000095"/> I88      IN THE RAPIDS. we found her talking quite-cheerfully. After they left, however, her face assumed an abstracted, anxious look. Nothing whatever passed between us in regard to the object of the Catons' visit. We now had to look in the face the trouble which Mr. Brandon, supported by my father, might give us, as my rupture with Mr. Baxter removed a safeguard, the only one heretofore thought of, inasmuch as it was all-sufficient. The Catons moved into the city very soon after, thus depriving me of the only society I had cultivated in the neighborhood; nor did they ever return,-as far as I know. The winter proved to be a very long one, and set in extremely cold, so that my out-of-door ex- ercise was very much restricted, the energy with which I formerly pursued it being, moreover, greatly impaired. The future looked desolate enough, aside from the difficulties which I must expect to beset me unrelent- ingly at home. I felt some diminution of the courage required properly to meet them, and it was daily more and more obvious' that mother's mind, sympathizing with her physical weakness, was failing, not in the determination butrin the power of resistance, while my father was kept fully up to the point of aggres- sion; for, notwithstanding the change in him which I am about to mention, in spite of an .apparent dis- position to become kinder, it was evident that in my absence scenes occurred :between him and my mother which proved that, whatever might be his will, the necessity of persecuting her continued. Returning to her at times, after an absence during which I knew   IN- THE RAPIDS.      I89 him to have been with her, I found her writhing under pain which was not bodily; and it was plainly from a continued and repeated cause, for it was each time more acute than the time before, and its effect on her health and spirits became daily more manifest. Whether moved by the counsel of his principal or not, my father changed the habits which had lost him all the power attaching to his relation to me; and those repulsive features of his character which had been exaggerated by them were toned down, not less by their abandonment than by the long-continued wear upon his feelings of the influence under which, viewed in his relation of parent, he was so unnaturally acting. His look was softened by a faint returning ray of the regard which, even if there had been less of nature in him, it was impossible for him not to have at one time for my sweet mother. There was a lowering of his voice, and a touch of grief was in it, now and then, when he addressed her or me. He sought our society at times, apparently as a palliative for the bitter thoughts which occupied him, but departed not from his ordinary taciturnity. Sitting, the three of us, at the fire of mother's bedroom, during an hour or more nearly every day of that bitter winter, the fierce blasts howling without, and the piled-up snow locking us up from nearly all the world, we presented a picture of greater domestic unity than the house could ever boast before. Oh, how I wish I could say that the reality of content and peace attended it! The altered demeanor of my father gave promise of doing more towards bending me to his wishes than all    <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6869-00000096"/> I go0     I THE RAPIDS. the appliances previously used. My filial regard had been held latent: it had not perished. - My mother's cautious outward observance of respect for him, her careful training of me in the nature of every duty, the voice of my own heart, now that it was for the first time appealed to in his regard, taught me that he should not be borne down by any sorrow which it was in my power to lighten. Was it -in my power to lighten this one?? Could I desecrate the sanctuary of that image which I formed at the faintest dawn of thought, and touched , anew with each coming idea of beauty, veiling it even from myself, until I saw its prototype in Laurence Manning? Could I throw down this image and set up that of the man whom I regarded as the opprobrium of humanity? )  Was it not Heaven that hid from me, until it gave me cause to fly it, a love that I thought no man but one knew how to feel, and which it had been crime to receive, and was so cruel to have to turn away? But, if I did not yield, where would my father's trouble end? If Laurence were not living, where would be the sin of yielding? If yet living, does he love me? Indeed, indeed he does. What! and yet so cruel? No, not cruel. Wait! wait! Must I kill my own father? Must he be more unkind than death? Standing at my mother's window, I look out upon the piled-up snow, each tiny flake frozen hard in its fall, mingling not with its fellows, desolate, unsus- tained by the helpless myriads around it, even as I in   IN THE RAPIDS.    1  9 the teeming, powerless, unhelping world, caught up in clouds by the fierce wind and dashed away from the bared earth, to be whirled back again by the return- ing, relentless gale. Even as the helpless snow am I dashed hither and thither by my relentless, ever-turn- ing thoughts. The groaning trees, bending, cowering before the blast, hold out their naked, imploring arms, begging that the merciless winds be stayed. As the groaning trees do I bend and cower before the storm of this affliction and implore that peace may come. But in what spirit? What tempted me with visions of joy which will not vanish? What gives bitterness to my grief and abasement-I fear it is not contrition -to my humiliation? Is it not mere human love, madly, blindly, untempered by any acknowledgment of the power, any appeal for the guidance of Him who holds the sea in the hollow of his hand, directs the fall of the tenderest twig from the shivering trees, and follows the tiniest snow-flake in its whirl upon the. wings of the gale? Did I ask God's blessing at its beginning? When has Sleep folded her dread mystery about me, when have I left her embrace, that I have not bowed me- before Him in amplest form and most earnest word of prayer?  Have I not asked blessings, as well on a father who has not been kind, as on a mother who has been all kindness? Have I not embraced friend and enemy in my supplications? But have I not granted this one passion such control, that I did not, because I almost dared not, leave it to the will of Thee, O    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6869-00000097"/> 192      7IN THE RA PID S. Father who art in heaven, lest thy will might not be my will? When I have not dared to pray that I alone should not drink the bitter draught which earthly life commends to all our lips, have I not asked that the gall of one affliction be not within it? Standing at mother's window, I look, out on the piled-up snow. Its flinty shreds, fanned by the breath of the resting storm, dance on the tingling panes: there is a murmur of hope in the creaking trees that their plea for peace is heard. Is there promise of joy yet left for me? The relentless thoughts that have swayed me so, will they cease from their merciless strife? A withering tremor, as of mortal fear, comes over the trees. Their naked arms are dashed, in wild con- fusion, high in the air. The laboring trunks reel under the blows of the shrieking blast. As I loojq4he piti- less winds tear up a blinding drift of the helpless snow, and dash it on, with a furious howl, against the quiv- ering glass. "Look no more!" they say. "We lash as we list the groaning trees. We drive where we will the helpless snow. Say whence we come, or whither we go, or pinion us down with thy feeble arms, and we'll tell thee what is in store for thee. But, look no more!"   CHAPTER XIV. aTHE winter passed. Grief clung with closer fangs upon our hearts. Budding spring nor blooming summer brought relief. Day and night was I tossed to and fro by my unhappy strife of thoughts. The ceaseless drag and wear upon body and mind made me sometimes feel that any end whatever might be better than this unremitting distraction. More than once, in the silent watches of the night, after hours of vain search for sleep, my mind pursued, hunted down, and worried in its every refuge, the very air pulsating with the sting of this teeming persecution,- more than once, in an access of desperation, have I been ready to make the sacrifice, had it been then demanded.   If I can be said to have reasoned at all beset as I was, during this period, I found arguments which rendered the immolation asked of me more -. rational than it would have been to yield to the deep, earnest, almost extravagant love recently offered and rejected. This last I did not feel I could ever fully return, and it was plain that it would sooner or later be expected of me, or perhaps it is better to say that I 'could not conceive its continued existence unreturned, unsustained by an answering passion. Nor would it grow gradually less violent and settle down to a mere passive feeling. No such love could have birth with- I7      ( I93)    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6869-00000098"/> 194.      IN THE RAPIDS. out a prospect of being nurtured by its peculiar and only sustenance. Failing of this, it would have , utterly perished. As for the other, nothing would be promised, nothing would be expected:- the worst would come at first, and, as there is no limit to the goodness of Providence, the future might be better, or the power be granted to endure it. No doubt ever crossed my mind that I had done less than strict justice both to myself and Mr. Baxter, notwithstanding that one of the results was my present painful situation. Mr. Brandon's visits, which had been but few during the winter, became constant with its departure. He made strenuous efforts, for periods of greater or less length, to remove the prejudices which his character, his habits, and his person had created; but the longer he made the trial the blacker became the record against him at every close of it. Towards the middle of one night, passed, like so many others that had preceded it, in wretched sleep- lessness, I was startled by a footstep on the floor. I might have been dozing for awhile, and this first one which I heard might have been preceded by others,  N either inaudible or unnoticed. It was only a single step, then, as far as I knew, and was not audibly repeated; and it was something so little to be ex- pected that I doubted my hearing, although the sound appeared to have struck my ear with great distinctness. This doubt saved me from I know not what, for it gave me time to consider what I had best do, if I had heard correctly; whereas, if I had been certain at first, the alarm might either have paralyzed me, or in-   IN THE RAPIDS.       I95 duced such noisy demonstrations of fright as the result will show it was desirable to avoid. My hearing was of course wrought up to its keenest tension, and I be- came gradually conscious of a sound, indeterminate at first, but finally clear and distinct, as my excited sense became exalted to the power of understanding it. It was the low, somewhat hissing puff given by the ex- piration of the breath when the mouth is closed of a person whose circulation is excited by muscular exer- tion or by intoxicating drink. That no one was in the room when I entered it, that I had locked the door, that I had foolishy neglected to have the room exam- ined after Mrs. Victor's departure, and was therefore yet exposed to her still unexhausted malignity,-these r-    thoughts passed all at once through my brain, pursued by a transient dash of terror, and then I was nerved up, and my faculties were collected for anything likely to occur. The sound remained in one spot for some time, and then it began to move. I heard hands along the wall, and presently on the door, which, though locked, as I have said, yielded under the pressure, for it stood off somewhat from the frame when closed, as it did not fit tightly and had a tendency to open, in- ward. The noise made by its coming in contact with the frame I heard distinctly, and it smote like the blow of a hammer on my heart. Was the person about to remove the key from the lock? If so, my only hope of escape was gone! The room next to me was unoccupied; then came the wide stairway, next my father's room, and, last, mother's, to which she had re- moved from the one next me, at the time of erecting    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6869-00000099"/> 196      IN THE RAPIDS. the wing containing her library room. While con- sidering whether or not my cries for, help would be heard by any one, in case I resorted to them,-which I did not desire to do, if it could be avoided, as I wished to spare my mother the shock of the alarm,- while thus considering, I heard the hands leave the door, and the bolt of the lock strike back against the box as soon as the pressure was removed. The key was not touched, or I would have heard it. The sound slowly approached my bed: the side of it on which I was lying faced the door. I gained the farther side, next the wall, from which it stood off a little dis- tance, and was on the floor in an instant, not, however, without having made some slight noise. The curtains of the bed, as well as of the windows, were closely drawn,-without regard to, the weather, however, but with the hope of getting some chance of sleep from the darkness. As the sound passed one of the win- dows, I persuaded myself that I observed the intercep- tion of the feeble light from without, even through both curtains of the bed. The sound came still closer. I felt that the bed-curtains were opened, and presently I heard the hands on the spot from which I had just risen. It was easy to detect how recently it had been vacated, and a smothered growl announced the man's disappointment, for the tone of the voice decided that it was a man. Be it credible or not, I must say that this discovery did not increase my alarm. I felt better prepared to defeat his evil purpose, whatever it might be, than to meet a fresh onset of the malignant treachery of whose power I had so recent and so s   IN THE RAPIDS.

This noise made him more par ticular, for he receded from the posture he had take] without its being repeated. He began to pass arounm the bed, towards me, inside of the curtains. At th foot of the bed, against the wall, was a semicircula table, with a small stand-mirror on it, and several hall empty bottles of perfumery. The distance from th table to the corner of the bed was about the same a between thebed and the wall, and barely sufficient t, allow me to pass without making a noise by jarrint what was upon it. It was a critical moment. Rapidl2 and noiselessly, holding my breath, I glided down t, the foot of the bed and around the table an instan before-it appeared to be almost the same instant- he passed around the inner corner of the bed, and s behind it: the curtain, thrown outward by the in terposition of his body, flapped againsomy garment! Pausing only to take breath, I crept rapidly toward the door, hoping to reach it at once, and expecting t have the guide of the position of the windows; but, i there had been' any light whatever coming throug them, as I had supposed when the man passed to th bed, the sky must have been suddenly and thickl overcast, for at this moment the room was shroude in utter darkness. Straight as I thought to hav walked, or rather crept, I halted; for I felt confused. remembered occasions when, rising in the dark, I ha wandered around the room half an hour or mor 17*    <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6869-00000100"/> 198      IN THE RAPIDS. without being able to find my way back to bed. I stood an instant, almost unnerved; for all my precau- tions, so carefully taken up to this moment, seemed about to fail. In the same instant I heard the rough breathing, in what I supposed to be the neighborhood of the table, but there was no certainty about it, for I had lost all idea of locality. All my--notiodns of -  shape, size, or distance seem-ed-merged into that of an unbroken circle, around and within which I was to wander with more or less chance of keeping out of his way. But I made, impulsively, two or three steps for- ward, and threw my arms out rapidly in all directions, encountering nothing, however, but the black air. The sound was not now moving. It had not increased in loudness, but if it had been the roll of a drum it could not have struck on my ear more distinctly. Most fortunately, just as my nerves, strained to the most painful tension, were on the point of giving way, a slight breeze shook the door, and I heard the noise made by the bolt against the box of the lock. It was not louder than the click of the pendulum of our mantel-clock, but it sounded the moment of my deliverance. It was at my left side and behind me, so that I must have turned completely around; and had I moved on with- out hearing it, I should have gone to the far end of the room. As it was, a single step backwards brought me within less than an arm's length-of the door. As I touched it, the sound moved towards me. By inspi- ration, I must suppose, for I had never heard of the precaution being used, and with a rapidity and deli- cacy of motion inconceivable to me now, I muffled[   - -    IN THE RAPIDS.       I99 the lock with the skirt of -my night-dress, and turned the key, as well as the knob of the latch, without creating the slightest noise, and, opening the door to the distance I required, by a quick pull, as I had seen the doctor do in entering or leaving mother's room in the most critical part of her sickness, I re- -moved thekey and glided out. The sound continued to approach me, though with irregular and occasionally suspended motion. I was now comparatively safe; but I desired to avoid the chance of being pursued, and it was necessary, for this, to lock the door on the outside. Almost unconsciously comparing the time required to do it with the rate of the approach of the sound, I drew the door to in the same noiseless manner in which I had opened it, catching it on my hand, and then, inserting the key, shut it entirely. At the same instant I heard, I may say I felt, the hands on the inside of the door, and the kat s roughly turned in my hand from the insider By a last effort, I gave the key a sudden, tremulous jerk around. The bolt shot out, the door was locked, and I was safe! The man struck the door violently with his fist, and uttered something which I will not repeat. It was the voice of Mr. Brandon I heard! To say I had no sus- picion of it before, I cannot; but I had not suffered myself, I had not time, to dwell on it. -The rough - breathingchat-like motion and lightness in his step, -and --dogged ferocity of expression, were now the only usual physical effects of intoxicating drink upon him. Once safe, I gave way completely. A racking ague t    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6869-00000101"/> 200      IN THE RAPIDS. shook me from head to foot. Had it not been for the support of the wall, I should have fallen to the floor; and I was compelled to stuff my mouth with my night-  dress to restrain the screams which it almost suffocated v me to withhold. I do not know how long I remained in this condition, or how long it took me to drag my- self, rather than walk, to mother's door. Waking her as gently as I could, I finally got in. I was in such agitation that it would have been useless to attempt any connected account of what had happened, even if I had then desired to do so. It took me some time to command words enough to say only that I had been terribly frightened, and that I must become calmer before I would be able to state how it had occurred. Alarmed as my mother was, she acquiesced in my desire to postpone an explanation. I continued to tremble long after I got into bed with her, and had no disposition to sleep; but, after I became somewhat quieted, she gave me a dose of an opiate which she was then occasionally using. Under its influence I soon fell into a profound and dreamless slumber, which lasted until a late hour in the morning. I postponed my recital until after we had break- fasted and I had taken a short walk. I then related the night's adventure to her exactly as I have written it down. She heard me through in silence, but with many changes of countenance; and by the time I had finished she had become worked up to the first fit of anger I had ever witnessed in her. Indignant as I was myself, I was astonished at her. It is a harsh word to use in connection with a being who was usually all   IN THE RAPIDS.       201 gentleness, but rage comes nearer than' any other expression to describing her excitement. "Go bring your father here! Bring him here, instantly!" she almost screamed. Actuated as much by a desire to allay her wrath by any means within, reach, as by the principle of obedi- ence, I ran out of the room to seek my father; but before I was out of hearing she called to me to come back. "Sit down, child," she said, in a voice which proved that she had recovered to some extent control over herself "Sit down, and let me think. Even this will not set your father against that man. It shows, how- ever, that there is no limit to the audacity, the wicked- ness, of the miserable creature. Cora, you must go away. It is hard, hard, very hard; but there is no help for it.- Nothing can befall you anywhere worse than what may happen here." I replied to her that I thought the man had meant no more, by what he had done, than to make me believe he had unusual power over me, with a view to operate on my fears; that she ought to consider her health, how much she needed my assistance, and how much less able she would be without me to withstand the annoyances which had already injured her so much. "Is it not wretchedness enough," she said, " to think that such a man has any power whatever over us? Once you are away, his power ceases. As for my health, it must improve as soon as they refrain from troubling me on this subject, as they will do when they know I I             ,    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6869-00000102"/> 202      IN THE RAPIDS. can give no account of you." I looked at her in great surprise. "Thaw fis exactly what I mean," she con-  tinued. "When I tell your father I do not know where you are, he will cease to question me; for I have never told him the slightest untruth,-no, nor any one else. Have no fear of my health. The doctor says that my mind needs relief in order that my body may be improved. You have had sad experience enough to give you prudence and judgment. You know who my friends are in the city. If you choose to go to any of them, do so, but say nothing to me about it. Nor shall you be a burden to them, nor to any one. Never ask a favor nor receive one which you are not able to repay. You have talents and a fair education, so that, even without money, you need not suffer. But I have money for you, hard as it is now to get it from your father, when this place properly managed would yield the income of a prince. I have enough for you to maintain you respectably until this trouble, whatever it is, is at an end, or until I ascertain the nature of it, I will take the risk of discovering where you can be found when necessary. I am almost glad that this last outrage was put upon us, for it has given me back the energy and resolution of ten years ago. It is hard to part from you, my daughter, but it must be so. Says nothing, Cora," she added, as I was about to speak: "we would both give way, and this is no time for anything but action. Make your preparations to depart at once, in the most secret manner possible. Devise your own measures, and act promptly."  I left the room almost bewildered by what I had   IN THE tRAPIDS.      20 203 heard; for, although I accepted her decision as final and as, in all probability, the only fit one to be made, it was some time before I could grasp the nature of the undertaking set before me. It was two or three days before J took the first step towards preparing for my departure, during which time mother never once alluded to the subject. With all her gentleness, her will was indomitable, and every one about her knew it, and no one expected her to repeat any direction given by her. From the time of this in- terview up to that of my departure, she wore an ex- pression continually bordering on the severe. I knew from it that I would find no relenting in her purpose to have me leave home, and no outward show of sympathy with the grief I might express at parting. Strange as the term may sound, I can only describe its effect upon me by saying it made me stand in awe of her, and that it completely prepared me for all the danger and discomfort I might encounter. It was on the afternoon of the last Monday in August that I announced to her my readiness to go. She handed me a roll of bank-notes, and some gold and silver coin, all of which I placed in my reticule. We parted-I not without bitter tears, indeed, but still much calmer than I ever could have expected to be under such circum- stances, she wearing the severe look which follows me to this day, because it was the one which she wore when I last looked upon what I supposed was her living face. My departure was retarded by the arrival of a builder to examine my room, at mother's instigation. He was not long in unveiling the secret means of    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6869-00000103"/> 204      IN THE RAPIDS. access to it. On sounding the back and inner side of one of the chimney cupboards, a hollow sound was  given forth; the same was the case in Mrs. Victor's former apartment overhead, as well as in the dining- room below, both of which rooms were provided with these cupboards. The investigation being pursued into the garret, a trap-door was found in one of the cuddies, which opened on a rude and quite precipi- ^;i  tous flight of stairs, fastened against the body of the '  chimney. Descending these stairs, the builder ascer-  tained that the back and inner partitions of the cup- board in Mrs. Victor's room were on hinges, and that  they were held in their ordinary position by small bolts in the edge of one passing through holes in the edge of the other, these bolts being fastened by keys. By drawing these keys the partitions swung back,  opening a passage from the stairs on to the floor of the cupboard, and so into the room. The cupboard below it in my room ,was- similarly fixed, and so was the one jn the dining-room, only that the latter had small shelves at intervals across it, to contain articles of the table-service. The stairs were found to descend to a walled-up space in the cellar, the existence of which would never have been suspected by us but for the discovery of it in this way, as the straight piece of wall which was erected to form the inclosure in connection with the ordinary foundation of the house appeared to- be a part of the latter. The T7builder pointed out 'to me the fact that the cupboardwas ' much narrower than the depth of the chimney, and that the decrease in the width of the chimney as it   ascended, and the space left between it and the casing, admited of the requisite inclination being given to the stairs and of the room required for the passage of a person from the garret to the cellar. He showed me marks of what he considered former fastenings within the cupboards, so that ingress into the room might be prevented by its occupant; but these had been removed, to either keep the whole arrangement concealed, or to prevent its being used unnecessarily. He offered several theories in explanation of the matter, the only one of which having any plausibility to me was that it was contrived as a means of se- creting, in an emergency, person, money, or valuables of any kind. The house was a very old one, and was possibly built at a time when the necessity of such a refuge existed. The garret-room, in the cuddy of which the trap-door was, was allowed to young Victor as a play-room; and to his investigations his mother was probably indebted for the knowledge which she put to such nefarious use. In the cuddy was found an old, camlet cloak with a hood to it, all covered with cobwebs, doubtless used to protect the dress of one or both of my troublesome visitors. I lost an hour in witnessing or hearing described what I have explained. At the end of that time, get- ting possession of my apartment, I completed my arrangements, and quitted the house for a period the very indefiniteness of whose duration added greatly to the pain of leaving. Saving my mother, I had taken leave of no one, not even old Therese. I mounted my horse and walked him slowly away, as 18    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6869-00000104"/> 206      ZIN THE RAPIDS. if about to take an ordinary afternoon stroll through the woods, not daring to give a farewell look back- wards to the dear old home, the centre of so many sweet and, alas! of so many bitter memories. The whole wide world was before me, and there was no telling to what spot on it I might be driven for a refuge. Slowly as I proceeded at first, each step seemed to take me miles away, and to expand in like ratio the measureless area before me. Although de- termined as to the direction I should take and the locality I should first seek, I had so exalted in my own mind the power and the industry of my perse- cutors, that, wide as the world now looked to me, it seemed all too small to exhaust their capabilities. My precautions, whether reasonable or not, were adopted in this view. When I was fairly out of sight of the house, I put my horse into a rapid canter and kept on for the dis- tance of six miles, and then turned from the road into the woodi, to take up a cloak and hat which I had deposited there, during my ride in the morning, under a tree that had been partially cut down and then allowed to fall, so as to admit of the grapes from a vine clinging to it being gathered. It had been cut down the previous season: the vine had grown vigor- ously since, and covered the tree and the space be- neath and immediately around it with a thick blanket of leaves, and thus made an excellent place of conceal- ment; and, as the grapes were not yet nearly ripe for this season, the chance of the articles being discovered was very small. I found them all safe as I had left them.   IN THE RAPIDS.       207 The hat was a black, low-crowned, stiff-brimmed beaver, which my father wore in winter. The cloak was also his, and was long enough to nearly reach my feet. I had removed the cape and the lining, so as to lighten it as much as possible, on account of the weather. All cloaks worn by gentlemen at this time were very long, and by the use of this one and the hat I hoped to pass for a proper wearer of it in the uncertain light which would attend me through the woods to the railway and during the night ride I should then have to the city. My face was so thinned and so pale that what little I expected to expose of it would suggest ill health as the cause of wearing so unseasonable a gar- ment. I had brought scissors with me, for the purpose of sacrificing my hair; but as gentlemen then wore their hair very long, and as I expected to throw off my disguise in a short while, I merely loosened it, turned it behind my ears, and, letting it fall down my back, covered it with the cloak, the collar of which I kept close around my neck. After hiding my bonnet and riding-skirt in the place from which I had taken the hat and cloak, I proceeded onward. I had yet ten miles to go to reach the railway; for the route I had thusfar taken led me awav from it, and I now had a circuit to make of that length to reach the station at which I was desirous to take the cars. The time lost at the house made it necessary for me to ride quite rapidly; but I experienced an unexpected difficulty, which I suppose arose from the road from this point being strange to my horse. I had great trouble to urge him on. He was constantly disposed    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6869-00000105"/> 208      IN THE RAPIDS. to stop,'and kept turning his head inquiringly to either side of the road, I had also to turn into the woods two or three times, once to pass around a person ahead of me going the same way, and the other times  to avoid meeting-others coming towards me; for I still  doubted my disguise or the propriety of its appear- ance, and, whether reasonably or not, I imagined the knowledge of my route would be fatal to any further efforts at concealment. The cars would pass the station about half an hour after dark, and the several hindrances detailed left me barely time to reach it, the last two or three miles being actually a race, and a dangerous one. It was my design to turn my horse loose, as he was, in case I had not time to do better; but as when I got within sight of the station the cars were not there, nor was the sound of their approach to be heard, I con- cluded to strip him of his saddle and bridle, so that on his way back, which I doubted not he would make with- out difficulty, his appearance might the better escape notice. Within a hundred yards of the station was a bridge thrown across a narrow but deep and rapid stream. Here I dismounted, and, loosening the girths of the saddle, pulled it off and pushed it over the side of the bridge into the water, and then removing the bridle threw it likewise over. I had hardly done this when the approaching train was heard, and, with a weakness which I am sure is pardonable, throwing my arms around and kissing the neck of my faithful horse, I turned from him and walked rapidly to the station. I purposely avoided purchasing a ticket, and stepped at   IN THE RAPIDS.       209 once into the cars, taking the inner seat of a vacant bench, close to thei door. The window was up, and, though it was now getting quite dark, I could see dis- tinctly any object within a few yards. I can scarcely say whether I was more surprised, gratified, or disap- pointed at finding that the faithful animal I had just parted with was not satisfied with the leave I had taken of him. He had followed me to the cars, and there he was, looking up into the window at me. I could not help putting out my hand to him. The cars started at the moment, but he started with them, increasing his speed with theirs; but of course the poor fellow was soon distanced, and I lost sight of him. I had no doubt that he would return home during the night. This much accomplished, safely seated in the cars within two hours' ride of the city, my mind felt relieved from the strain which had been on it during the whole of the day, and I began to feel the necessity of food, for I had not eaten a morsel since the previous day at dinner. At the next station the cars stopped, and the conductor announced that a certain time would be allowed for refreshments. Hcould not avoid the temptation to procure something, and was probably excited to some extent to do so by the general rush made by nearly all the passengers out of the cars. Tea and sandwiches were promptly served in the principal room of a building standing a couple of yards from the track. If I had been satisfied with the first quantity I procured, I might have saved the mis- hap which befell me; but, after consulting my watch, I I 18    <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6869-00000106"/> 210      IN THE RAPIDS. found that more than half the time yet remained given by the conductor, and, although most of the passen- gers had left the room, I persisted in staying, in order to better satisfy my hunger. I was astonished to find, when I reached the door on my way out, that the train had moved noiselessly off, and, though very slowly, was now some yards away, and going with fn increase of speed that made my heart thump with trepidation. Even before the thought of what was happening had fairly entered my mind, the last car plunged into the thick darkness. I instinctively rushed after the train, and ran for awhile with considerable speed, gaining on it, I am inclined to think, though I felt in danger of falling over the cross-ties or the intersecting rails of the switch. "Can't catch 'em," said, the rough though kind voice of a man with a lantern, who met me. Whether I could or not, this remark produced enough of hesitation to lose me the opportunity if it were within my reach. I turned sorrowfully back to the house whose not over-savory fare had tempted me into this trouble, and took a seat on a bench outside the door, away from the light. "Freight- train along in half an hour-passenger-car attached- can get on," said the same rough, kind voice of the man with the lantern, passing along a few minutes after I had taken my seat. The half-hour appeared to be about to last until day- light, counting time by my anxiety, though strictly within the period named, according to my watch, the train came on, and I got in. I found no passen- gers but men in the single car set aside in this train ^   IN THE RAPIDS.       2" for the use of travellers, and there were only about a half-dozen of them; grouped together at one end, while I took a seat at the other. They were smoking the vilest cigars, and amusing themselves by coarse songs and stories. My situation was wretched, mise- rable, beyond description. From the sight that I got of their faces by an occasional glance and with the light of a badly-trimmed lamp suspended on one side of the car, I could'see that my companions were men of the roughest stamp, and that I was in no little danger should they discover my sex. Presently one of them came towards me. As I was leaning my head at the time on the back of the bench before me, I pre- tended to be sleeping. The man stood bending over me for a few minutes, and then went back. Some- thing which he said suspended the boisterous speech and laughter of his comrades, and they began to con- verse in a lowelr tone than they had yet used, but not too much so for me to understand them. I made out in a little while that some criminal had escaped in the morning from a neighboring jail, and that my un- seasonable disguise and my avoidance of their com- pany pointed me out to them as probably the fugitive. Two of them g(t up and approached me. I raised my head, but kept my left hand, which was the only one gloved at the rnoment, oyer my face, passing it across my, forehead and eyes, as a person does generally when awaking  This was all that courage or fear could inspire e to do in the emergency; but it seemed to be sufficient, for they desisted, for the time at least, from further scrutiny, and went away. ' * -    i    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6869-00000107"/> 212      IN THE RAPIDS. The train came suddenly to a halt, and, after wait- ing nearly an hour, some one came in and said a cattle-train had broken down ahead of us, and that it would be another hour before we could go on. There X was nothing to be done but to retain my seat and await the removal of the obstruction; but my anxiety J and alarm dragged out the hour to an interminable length. Finding that at the end of the time named the train did not move, I gave way to a feeling of great fatigue, which ended, in spite of my uneasiness, in sleep. I was aroused by a rough shake of my shoulder, and a rougher voice, saying, "We won't get away from here to-night. You had better go up town and go to bed." I started up instantly, and had not the man turned immediately away from me he might readily have discovered the fact that I was disguised. It took me some minutes to realize where I was; but the words spoken by the man were not forgotten, and I soon followed him out. I had tied a handkerchief around my mouth, so as to confuse the sound of my voice. When I got out, I recognized the person who had awakened me by his talking to some others, and determined to follow him, as I soon found all the others did. It was not until this moment that I found my hat was not on my head. First observing that the others were walking towards the river, along which the road ran, and in the direction of a house sufficiently lighted up to show that it had the appear- ance of a hotel, I hurried back to the car, to find my hat. The single lamp had been extinguished; but I readily found the seat I had occupied. All the search   IN THE RAPIDS.       213 I made for my hat was vain, and I had to come away without it. I hurried out and towards the house I have alluded to. Guided by their numbers and their general appearance as they crossed the light, I could see the others entering it as I was about half-way off. I re- solved, if I could not procure sleeping accommoda- tions without exposing myself, to return to the car and wait until morning enabled the train to go on. Fortunately, I encountered a waiter at the hall-door, whom I persuaded to show me to a room at once, as I said I was sick,-which was literally true. The only unoccupied room was one built on a level with the second story, across a space between the two origi- nally dwelling-houses forming the hotel, as I call it for want of a more fitting name, the space below the room being used as a gateway to the sort of court- yard behind. The apartment was the most miserable one I had ever entered in my life. It possessed every necessary evidence of uncleanliness. I could not think of undressing and trusting myself to such bedclothes as garnished the rickety bedstead, but concluded to lie on the coverlet under my cloak. I had put half a dozen handkerchiefs, as many collars, and two or three pairs of stockings in my reticule, and these things, -with the money mother gave me, completely filled it. At the time of paying the conductor I took the roll of notes from under the other articles, but when return- ing it I put it on top of them. Opening the reticule now, to get a handkerchief to interpose between my head and the unclean pillow-case, I discovered that the roll of notes was not in it. At the time of falling    <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6869-00000108"/> 214      IN THE RAPIDS. asleep, it was on my arm, and my hands were clasped together. The handle of the reticule was iron, covered with leather, or I suppose it would have been cut and the whole carried off, as upon further examination I found my watch was also gone, which I wore in my waist-belt and had it fastened to a chain suspended around my neck. That I had been robbed during my sleep was plain enough; and the disappearance of my hat was also thus accounted for. Great as was my consternation at the loss of the money, upon which so much depended, I was yet more troubled by the consideration that the thief must have been one of the rough characters who was on the car with me, and that he must have discovered my sex and was now in the hotel. But further thought induced the hope that, in view of what he had done, he would rather avoid than expose me. This modicum of relief was my closing thought for the time on the whole subject. Piling against the door every article of furniture in the room which I could lift, I lay down, and enjoyed a tolerable night's rest. I was aroused at the dawn of day by the noise of a succession of vehicles passing through the gateway under the room. I thought the end of them would never come. The drivers never ceased to swear and shout at one another and at their horses. It was un- doubtedly some arrival extraordinary. Taking a sur- vey of the court-yard, to ascertain if possible what it all meant, the first thing which struck my sight was my hat, swung by a. string over the back of a man standing in the yard talking to a woman. My atten-   IN THE RAPIDS.       215 tion was next turned to the latter, in whose carriage I thought I recognized something familiar, so much so that I determined to send for her, for the purpose of procuring my hat for me from her companion. I resolved not to leave the apartment during the day, but to remain and take the night train of cars, and was about addressing myself to the breakfast, such as it was, which I had had served in the room, the waiter who had brought it having been dispatched in search of the woman I have mentioned, when the latter was ushered, without the ceremony of knocking at the door, into the apartment. Greatly, wretchedly changed as she was, I instantly recognized Kate Rosmond! i'    <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6869-00000109"/> CHAPTER XV. SHE had the hauteur, the defiant air, of old,-if any- thing, more defiant, more haughty,-the same high color in her cheeks and the same fierce fire in her  eyes. Where, then, was the change? It was easier to see it than it is to describe it. When we have scanned a young face and seen reflected in it the fair future which high hope , and favoring fortune are promising in the distance, and when we meet that face again, if fortune has deserted and hope has faded from it, we recognize the chastening touch of resignation in its lines, or the broader marks of abiding grief, and read the sad story in the sequence, finding our relief in the ultimately compensating action of nature. But the face before me was one which might be said never to have reflected the idea of hope, and while its wearer might have undergone, she never could be said to have  suffered from, disappointment. I speak now not from what I know of her, but simply from what was sug- gested by her present appearance. Other women might be said to have tasted the bitterness of a wicked life and to have suffered. This one's nature was so made up, or so turned, that the gall was honey, the suffering was ecstasy, because it proved what she had dared. They were as the wounds, the blood of the soldier,-his lopped-off arm tossed with a huzza up (216)   IN THE RAPIDS.       217 into the air. Dazed with the idea that for her fierce, daring, restless nature there would be no content within the restraints of moral and social laws, no pleasure worth the tasting not snatched from the midst of peril, on the brink of destruction, ay, in its very certainty, if the fruit did turn to ashes on. her lips, the ashes were not rejected. She came into the, room with a look which plainly said, "Who has had the impudence to send for me?" arfd, instantly recognizing me, she burst into a most immoderate fit of laughter. There was much in this of her school-day style, but there was much else in it that made me shudder. I had often thought of her and of her probable fate from what Laurence had said of Etheridge; and independently of this, and of what was visible in her appearance, there seemed to be a repellent atmosphere surrounding her. Without being conscious of it, I suppose, we both refrained from offer- ing any mark of civility. Her name sprang impulsively from my lips when she first came'in. Beyond that, I did not speak for some time. She, however, rattled away in disconnected speech, without inquiring why I sent for her or what I wanted; and, ludicrous as the idea. may seem, there was a patronizing tone in her voice, that had a most uncomfortable effect, which of itself made me much regret having sent for her. I had often thought it would pain me, on her own account, to meet with her; but, even with an effort, I could bring no such idea to my mind at this time. I told her of the loss of my hat and watch; the money I did not mention, because, if she could not obtain the 19    <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6869-00000110"/> 218       IN THE RAPIDS.  return of it, she might offer me the use of some, and, take offence at my refusal. She left the room, and re-  turned before long with the missing articles. She evidently imbibed thE notion that my clandestine  journey was undertaken for some disreputable pur- pose. I did not undertake to combat the idea, and it was necessary for me to ask her to assist me by her reticence in maintaining my disguise. It was not the first time since I left home that I regretted adopting it, or, rather, using it beyond the point at which I took the cars. It would have been an easy matter for me to have concealed my bonnet under the cloak, and to have deposited the latter and the hat where I put the saddle and bridle. Kate was in and out of my room at intervals during the day, always with a riding-whip in her hand, which she cracked frequently, and sometimes switched the fur- niture with it by way of emphasis to her remarks. She gave, unasked, a great many particulars of her history since I had seen her, interspersing them with observa- tions which, coming from such a person, I have deemed worth writing down, together with such facts related by her as I can repeat, and especially as she reappears in the course of this recital in a better light. Some of her ideas are curious from their very extrava- gance. I report her with strict correctness, both thought and style, and even words, when admissible, though giving connection and sequence of my own arrangement. That I did not fail to urge her to reform will appear from what she says. "I began the world with an inheritance of unmerited   IN THE RAPIDS.       219 obloquy. I had not the temperament for a life of in- nocent obscurity, nor the patience to await the chance, by a fortunate marriage, of a deliverance from it. Neither did I command the pliant talent of cringing to the wealth which could have brought me a brilliant position: from the start I despised the practical-the more than practical, the mean-ingenuity that followed every pleasure, every necessity of existence, to its last farthing of expense: I learned, because I could not help learning, the cost of the nourishment I drew from my mother's breast, and of my first slice of bread-and- butter. The clothing on my back, the shoes on my feet, were not things to keep out the cold: they were pieces of chinking silver hung around my neck, choking me. "The misdirected judgment of the world made my mother an unhappy woman, a misguiding parent: I 1 hated the world. The wealth of my uncle so gilded over his ignorance and his meanness that the world truckled to him, fawned upon him, bent the knee to him: I despised the world. With such feelings mingling with all others, good and bad, that I had, the one perished and the others were intensified. Of the hereafter which turns affliction into virtue for so many, I had but my own instincts to give me a knowledge, and they were not adapted to correctly impart it. Gold was the deity of one who ought to have had the will to instruct me, and unmerited trouble gave me nothing but irritation from the other. With no foundation laid at home for moral education, it was a tedious and un- improving task during the weary years at school. I          - '    '    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6869-00000111"/> 220      IN THE RAPIDS. knew I was sent there to be got rid of. I learned what attracted me, and my own gratification was the rule of my obedience. "The time came for the birth of the mysterious, in- evitable feelings which make so much of the happi- ness or the misery of my sex. It was not my nature to crush or silence them, nor my cue to hold them in virtuous, patient abeyance. I acted in obedience to their unnatural violence, in derision of social laws which all that I knew taught me not to respect. In- spired by defiance of danger, a taste for only such pleasure as is seasoned by peril, emboldened by a courage which rejoices to contend with opposition,  and guided by a temperament that has never recog- I nized any distance of space or time between a wish  and its gratification, what would have been shame, dis- I appointment, to others was not such to me. I had lost what I had never learned to value: I gained a knowl- edge of how many had it not and yet retained its reputation. I had eaten of tfl fruit of-the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. "I took to the theatre, and have rolled out many a sounding line on the beauty and dignity of virtue, and with applause, too. I have been called before the curtain to be thanked for- the fidelity with which I have acted a simulated life of trial and difficulty end- ing in a pledge of dignified and honorable marriage. But I delighted only in the plays which permitted me to speak to my own sin; but the text was ever too tame, and I could never stick to it. I too often saw in the intelligent and respectable audience so many /   IN THE RAPIDS.       221 to whom I could say, Come to my bosom, sister. I have singled out more than once a proud, staid matron,- and mortified her with her own story; and as often have I made the innpcent wreath of orange- blossoms burn like a crown of white-heated iron on the head of a reputed maiden. I carried this too far, and ceased to be popular. "(I am now employed at what delights me more. I am the chief female rider in a strolling circus. How- ever great my delight in the hate with which the world hak inspired me towards it, I have ample room for revenge in the practice of this business. We gather in, as we stroll, not only the middle-aged and the old, but young men and women, and even the in- nocent children; and each night's performance is a seed-time of corruption. There is nothing that I dare not do, and nothing that I do is enough. As to its effect upon myself, it is an absorbing fascination from the instant my horses start: the rapid clatter of their hoofs, the thrilling music, the crack of the ring- master's whip, the pursuing, excited eyes of the audi- ence, their mad plaudits, the familiar peffume of the scattering tan and sawdust, all combine into an in- spiration which makes me dare and overcome any peril of life or limb, with a triumphant smile. My blood is on fire; I forget where I am; the ring is too small, and I long for horses that could outstrip the lightning. I do not know what I do, but I know it is what women never did before me. If I were to say to what point of danger and excitement I would go: harness me a hundred horses, their combined speed I9'    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6869-00000112"/> 222      IN THE RAPIDS.' multiplied a thousandfold, and I would drive them in full career where the variation of a hair would dash me to atoms!  "Reform! I never think of it. What could I be- come? Only a despised object of public charity; and mine is not the spirit to submit to that humiliation. If I were but a man, heroism, and not infamy, would characterize my career of vice, even were I ten times guiltier. Short as my experience in the world has been, I know that the approving smiles of one sex, and ready honors at the hands of the other, have been meted out to men who could give me lessons in cor- ruption. If some Daniel will come to judgment and tell me the sense, the justice, of this, he may take me for his wife; and I would be a faithful one, too. Does the loss of one virtue render us incapable of retaining any other, and do men differ from us in this respect? Not a bit of it. Did not our good- \natured principal tell us once a week that whoso- ever violated one tittle of the law was guilty of the whole? and is not this meant for everybody? In the case in point, I am sure it is true. The man who fol- lows my footsteps in wrong-doing is restrained from other vices by human considerations only. He may -be chary of his honor among men, but he has lost it before Heaven, as much as I have; and, as our prin- cipal used to tell us that human laws and social ob- servances are only correct so far as they are established in the spirit of divine institutions, the judgment that makes me an outcast and still holds a halo of respect-  ability around him must have its inspiration from the   IN THE RAPID S.       223 devil. Let mankind do as we are taught Heaven designs to do,-to punish the same sin alike in all, or mete out equal mercy and pardon to it in all, upon contrition. But do not talk about reform to me in the face of the present absurdity. Not that I do not de- sire to see it, for the sake of the immediate sufferers- I can have sympathy with them, at least, without despising the general world one whit the less. I am as yet unscathed. My career has been rapid, exciting, and successful. To morrow is my only future. What the, successor of to-morrow may bring I do not care / to think. I chose my own lot, and ask neither pity nor charity, even if I reach that point of deplorable wretchedness which I have witnessed, and where I would have prayed, if I were given to prayer, that death or madness might in mercy intervene. "Why think of beginning your reform with such as I am? Go to the theatre, and see how many plays are put on the stage which depend for their interest and attraction upon the seductive thoughts they suggest in relation to that for which I am cast out, or rather by which I cast myself out. Take from the stage all that is calculated to excite prurient, ruinous curiosity, and from the spectators all who go there to gratify it, and it would become a beggarly business. You can wit- ness, if you will, an opera, where innocence, hitherto I safe in honest obscurity, is destroyed by the direct agency of the arch-demon; you learn that life-long piety perishes before the glitter of a few trinkets, and that the devil having purchased one soul is allowed to pay for it by risking another; and side-splitting    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6869-00000113"/> 224      IN r7IE RAPIDS. laughter from dignified fathers, honest mothers, inno- cent daughters, is the response he gets to the good- humored chuckle with which he witnesses the crown- ing success of his temptation. And the long-deferred  payment of his part of the infernal bargain, the pay-  ment which you go there to witness, which you pay yourmoneyto see,-and you would go away grumbling and disappointed if you failed to see it,-this payment is handed over in presence of the holy emblem of divine redemption! Hardened, defiant as I am, this has made me shudder: though I lay no claim to any of the virtues of Christianity, I can understand why sacred things should be respected. When the regenerated victim is wafted upward by ministering angels to the regions of eternal bliss, then it is that my laugh comes in, at witnessing the approving verdict"of an audience who, if the thing were a reality a, she came back next day with a heaven-indited patent of purifica- tion written on her brow, would turn her from their doors! "Women, to say nothing of what men do, write you a work of fiction, and unblushingly put their names to it,-women who in actual life you dare not charge with harboring an indelicate thought, but who create for you a heroine whom they make a paragon of virtue in order to enlist your interest, and then excite your solicitude by keeping her toying with infamy throughout the remainder of the book, and make you wonder at the cleverness which prevents her from em- bracing it.

When the interest of a story hangs upon the probability of sin, the reader, like the spectator at the opera, requires that the promise of the writer, like that of the tempter, shall be fulfilled; and it inevitably is, directly or by implication, to the  reader's mind ere the play is played out, and, oh! my masters, so often in the desecrated name of virtue! I would not give a crack of my whip for reform which does not begin with evils like these. Ij  "Reform?

Because he gives a modicum of it in paraded charity, the community, if he were to die to-morrow, would deck his memory with a wreath of all the virtues. With what patience can I listen to a society that calls on me to reform, and gives him the name of a Christian gentleman?"    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6869-00000114"/> CHAPTER XVI. IGHT coming on, I made preparations for con- tinuing my journey. The coin which was in the bottom of my reticule still remained to me, and from it I dispensed the amount of the surprisingly trifling bill which the aforementioned waiter presented at my asking. I got out of the hotel without being observed, even by Kate. Inherent curiosity, her own dominant demeanor, and the weakness of my position had combined with me to admit her society up to a certain point; but her company to the cars would not have been desirable. I reached the train in time, and got a comfortable and secluded seat. To avoid an explanation of the reason of my having the wrong conductor's check, which would have involved more talking than I was willing to trust myself to, I paid at the first word of objection, for a second time, my fare from that point to the city. I began to under- stand the use and value of money. The train reached the-city in an hour. Not only during that hour, but frequently in the course of the day, I had pondered upon what would be the proper mode of doffing my disguise. It had now become a positive burden, and ceased to be considered as necessary or useful iln evasion of a pursuit, my fears of which had by this time considerably diminished. I had decided upon (226)   IN THE RAPIDS.        227 nothing, even upi to the moment of taking the car- riage, of which several were placed at my disposal at the station. Almost unconsciously, I gave the driver the name of the hotel at which I had stopped to break- fast on my way from school. I did not recognize the house when he stopped before it. I learned, upon questioning him through the confusing folds of my handkerchief, thatthere was a different entrance for ladies; and at this, after some parleying, he put me down. While talking with him, the proper plan of procedure had occurred to me. I sent the servant who opened the door for me for the proprietor, and I remained standing in the hall until he came. Fortu- nately, there was no one in sight or hearing of us when he arrived. If a ghost had risen out of the floor, he could not have been more astonished and confused than he was when, before speaking, I raised my hat, and, dropping the cloak from my shoulders, stood be- fore him in my proper person. Though in no humor for laughing, I could scarcely refrain from doing so. I frankly told him that my visit to the city and in disguise was for reasons of personal safety, and asked him to grant me his protection and the opportunity of remaining in his house in private for awhile. I gave him my name, and referred him to the date of my first visit for a verification, as far as it would go, of my identity. He promptly and cheerfully acceded to all that I desired. During my short stay at his house, all possible pains were taken to promote my comfort and my privacy, and, I have reason to believe, my secret was strictly guarded.    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6869-00000115"/> 228      IN THE RAPIDS. After a day passed in entire rest of body, and in what tranquillity of thought I was able to command, I turned my attention to the means necessary to be adopted for defraying my expenses during my absence from home. I determined to follow my mother's ad- vice in regard to refraining from a resort to her friends; nor would I venture to communicate with her, even in the unanticipated sudden loss of nearly all the means placed by her at my disposal. I resolved, then, to engage in any respectable employment for which I was adapted; and, though naturally shy, I felt that I must and could summon the confidence to attempt, and the energy to pursue, any available occupation. My first recourse was to the city papers; but my perusal of them, instead of opening any prospect of success, suggested a difficulty of which the thought produced a sudden and almost overpowering heat of shame and embarrassment. There were plenty of ad- vertisements offering positions for which I felt com- petent, and which would have suited me, but conditions were attached, even to the considering of an applica- tion, rendering it altogether useless for me to make an attempt, in view of the nefarious use which had been made of my record-book,-that is, supposing Mr. Baxter's statement as to its wide-spread effect to be correct; and this I had no reason to doubt. This was an appalling state of things. My money could last but a little while longer, and, that gone, I should not know which way to turn. A week passed under this condition of-embarrassment, when my attention was attracted by a notice for a copyist. Without stopping   * IN THE RAPIDS.       229 to think whether it was a position which a woman would be permitted to fill, I immediately repaired to the place of business of the advertiser, "H. Crownrig, Conveyancer." Upon presenting myself, and asking to see this person, I was detained for some time in the front office, where three or four gentlemen were engaged writing, for an hour or longer, during which time two or three persons came out of a second room, at different times, and went away. Finally, I was ushered into this second room, and told I would find Mr. Crownrig in it. - With this information, I addressed by that name the only person I found in the room, and made known my business. A smile, which made me feel wretchedly uncomfortable, passed over his face. He seemed to become suddenly conscious of a very comical idea. 'He said, "Who advised you to X  come here? You ought to know that we always ctn- ploy men in this business. Good-morning." And he stepped forward to open the door for me to pass out. But, as he'laid his hand upon the knob, he checked himself, and said, "Let me see. Sit down again awhile." He resumed his seat, and became at once buried in profound thought. The glare which speaks not of the absence of speculation, but of a mind full of it, came into his eyes; and he twisted his mouth about in every direction, chewing at the lining membrane of it as if he meant to nibble away the last shred. He was an old, ill-favored man, and his expression during this prolonged cogitation gave me an unfavorable opinion of him. It lasted so long that I began to think he had forgotten me, when he suddenly darted up from his 20    <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6869-00000116"/> 230      IN THE RAPIDS. seat, drew off his spectacles, swinging them around in his hand, and said, "If you will call here at this hour to-morrow, I may give you something to do." This interview, it may be said, was the first occasion of testing my own unaided resources as to their capa- bility of dealing with the rougher realities' of life. I left t'he office with whatever I had possessed of self- sufficiency entirely gone; and I began to wonder from P what source and in what manner I had imbibed the idea that I should ever be capable of taking care of and supporting myself. I kept, however, the best heart I could, with a view of not only grappling at once with the new and increasing difficulties present- ing themselves, but also to distract myself by imme- diate and constant occupation from the anxious thoughts about home, which were becoming hourly more distressing. I did not suffer myself to be de- ceived as to the remuneration to be expected from my prospective occupation. I saw, from the wan visages and the shabby habiliments of the gentlemen writing in the front office, how very far from liberal it must be in my inexperienced instance. It indicated self-denial in a direction hitherto unknown to me, but not greater than I felt myself equal to. I returned to Mr. Crownrig's offices in the morning, and was conducted by him to a third room, behind the one in which I had met, him. This was an entirely private one, and in it he informed me I was to be sta- tioned while engaged at anything he had for me to do. I concluded not to give my own name to him, and assumed that of Caroline Dalton. He employed me   IN THE RAPIDS.      231 the first day at copying useless pieces of writing, for the purpose of acquiring some degree of uniformity and repressing the extravagant size of some of my letters. My handwriting pleased him, for it had been formed from that in my grandfather's account-books, as my mother wrote a small,' cramped, and almost illegible hand. He learned from me that I had no relatives and visited ho acquaintances in the city, and this led to an interview with his wife-his family residing over the offices-for an object, as I am satis- fied, in furtherance of the design which it will appear he had in engaging me. This lady was a sharp- visaged, shrewd, and very affable person, always handsomely, even extravagantly, dressed. I wish I could apply the name of kindness to th conduct im- mediately adopted by her towards me; for it is dis- agreeable to be deceived into yielding even temporary gratitude. I spent, at her earnest solicitation, the first evening with them, and, with so little circumlocution as to surprise me, was pressed to pass the hight in the house, and I consented to do so. On the following day it was arranged that I should board with them. On that same day I was given a very long will to copy from a pencilled sketch of one in Mr. Crownrig's hand- writing, no name being inserted, however, by which I could learn whose it was. I wrote it off with a great deal of care, and succeeded in getting through with it without a single error. As Mr. Crownrig was out when I finished it, and I had nothing else that I could do, I took up a book and amused myself with it for the remainder of the day. He did not make his ap-    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6869-00000117"/> 232      IN THE RAPIDS. pearance in the office again until the next morning, when, taking the two papers from me, he went with them into the middle office. I had observed that  from the- first moment of his wife's extraordinary  civility to me he had become very churlish, and  assumed a domineering style in addressing me. If  there is one of my faults worse than the rest, it is that  of yielding too easily to the influence of persons with  whom  I am brought in contact. In this case, its effect was to make me dread offending this man, both to avoid his displeasure, which began to present itself  as something terrible, and to escape a disturbancel of the agreeable relations already established with his wife. He returned after awhile, looking cross, and, speaking quite harshy, pointed out an omission I had made, as he said, in copying the sketch or rough draft given me. It was evident that my copy was not accord- ing to the draft in the particular pointed out by him. It was equally evident that the draft had itself been altered since it had left my hands, by erasing several lines and writing them so much closer together as to admit of the insertion of the pretended omission with- out greatly affecting the uniform appearance of the sketch. I had not the courage to insist upon what was so evident. He directed me to make another copy, which I at once proceeded to do. This, when done, he declared entirely satisfactory, and he took away the two copies and the rough draft. I pondered for awhile unavailingly over this piece of palpable duplicity. I could see clearly enough afterwards that it was de- signed for the purpose of weakening my self control.   IN THE RAPIDS.       23 For the two following days I was employed copy- ing papers, indorsed "deeds" and "leases;" into a large book. On the third morning, after breakfast, Mr. Crownrig, who had been exceedingly affable during that meal, expressed a wish to have me accompany him to witness the signing of the will I had written off. I was thinking at the moment of my pretended blunder, and this proposition gave me some unpleasant suspicions, although I had a very indefinite idea of the nature of the act he was now alluding to. I hesitated before answering, when his lady, probably attributing the delay in my reply to another cause, said she would go along with us. Though still not satisfied, I could not withhold my consent. Mr. Crownrig, his wife, one of the young gentlemen from the front office, and myself, took a carriage at the door, and were driven at a leisurely pace for about three-quarters of an hour, reaching in that time a large, old, and much-neglected mansion, just beyond the city limits. All the window-shutters were closed except those of the front second-story bedroom, and the win- dows of this were closely curtained. Although it was warm weather, a chilly, damp air pervaded the house as we entered it. As far as I could see, it was abun- dantly and extravagantly furnished, but there was a cheerless primness about everything. We imme- diately ascended to the bedroom with the open win- dow-shutters. Mrs. Crownrig, however, either did not accompany us or quitted the room shortly after entering, as I missed her very soon after. 20;     , .i, i '   ^         ;' i    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6869-00000118"/> CHAPTER    XVII.. ,        , \A7VVE found in this apartment two persons, one of them an elderly woman, easily recognized as a E professional nurse, the other an old man, whom at the moment she was assisting to maintain a sitting I posture in bed, by packing him around with a number of pillows. The conveyancer approached the bed with S a cringing, deferential bow. "Well, Crownrig," the old man gasped out, motion- i ing him, as well as the nurse, away from him, by an impatient sweep of his hand, rendered more decisive in its impatience by a rapid working of his outstretched  fingers. He seemed to be suffocating and to need air. He threw his head back and set his mouth agape, his small gray eyes protruding painfully. All of us stood , motionless and silent during the paroxysm, the time it lasted giving me an opportunity to examine his ap- pearance. He wore, notwithstanding the heat of the weather, a gray woollen night-cap, which covered his head nearly to the eyebrows. completely concealing his hair, if any yet remained to him. He was for a long time unshaven: grizzly unkempt beard wrapped up his face to the cheek-bones. I had never witnessed death nor its near approach, but always conceived it as something productive of refinement in whatever of the grosser feelings of our nature finds expression in ( 234)   B[ IN THE RAPIDS.            235 the face. I gifted every one with my own idea of F the relief that it must bring from a troublesome world, j as well as the feelings of curiosity and hope which I X had gathered from, my sense of the limitless, undying Ipowers of the mind and the unsatisfying character of earthly existence. I could not have witnessed a scene a better adapted to dissipate such thoughts than the one before me. To begin with, there was not the slightest trace of an expression visible in what could be seen of his face, of any thought of death. Dissatis- faction with his helpless condition, and a peering anx- iety about worldly affairs fallen into derangement by reason of it, were prominently visible. It would not i be easy for me to say at the time what had been the Eruling passion of his nature, but, clearly, it had not liberalized his mind, and it had furrowed and seamed his visage so completely with, its characteristics as to leave no space upon it for the reflection of any idea not of it or in some way connected with it. It had marked him as solely its own. I pitied him; I felt sick at heart for him; I mentally prayed for him, as I would for a human soul caught and inextricably en- tangled in the life-long pursuing, unescapable toils of an insatiable, wicked spirit Ij   The paroxysm over, a chil seized him, and the nurse covered his shoulders with a blanket ready for the purpose in her hands. "You brought that paper, did you, Crownrig? Was this the day I told you to bring it? I don't think I'l sign it now.- I feel better; and when I get up I'll have one prepared at my leisure. These are the ' .    <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6869-00000119"/> 236      IN THE RAPIDS. witnesses, I suppose. I am sorry you troubled 'em to ! come. It is so strange that, many as used to flock i about me once, now I can hardly get a .look at a  friendly face. They all know, I suppose, I am not I going to leave 'em any money."    ' He said all this very rapidly, as if to compress all he could into as short a time as possible, evidently in dread of a return of a suffocating attack, and denying by it his expressed opinion of probable recovery.  The conveyancer, in the same cringing, deferential ! manner with which he first approached him, repre- sented to him the possibility at least of his dying be- fore being able to prepare any more satisfactory will.  This one had been drawn up in accordance with his known wishes, and after it was signed and witnessed  it would be easy to destroy it if he got better, and make another; whereas, if he happened to die with- out a will, all his proDer ould go as he knew how. Another paroxysm   came on before this argument ended.  It lasted linger than the first one I saw, and I I really had no hope of seeing him survive it. "You can read the will, Crownrig. You are sure of these witnesses, are you? I can't understanld your objection to being one. I'm not going to leave you anything. I have given you plenty of my work all your life, and paid you for it. Couldn't you get two men you could depend upon?   I don't like the notion of a woman witnessing my will. Mind you, miss, keep all this quiet. I am going to die a rich man,--a very rich man. I am going to take the world by surprise.  Nobody knows, but Crownrig here, how   IN THE RAPIDS.       237 rich I am; and I don't believe he knows. Keep it all quiet until I am gone. Do you hear? Read away, read away, Crownrig. Let us hear it. Nurse, you can leave the room awhile." The conveyancer obeyed him, and, as he began, the sick man pointed to a pair of spectacles lying on the : dressing-bureau, which the clerk then brought him. He indicated, by a second gesture, that one of the curtains should be drawn aside. This threw a strong light full on Mr. Crownr:ig's face; and in this face, now quite close to him, the dying rich man gazed  with an eager scrutiny during the rapid but perfectly distinct reading of the paper. It began in the usual style of such documents. Since it had left my hands, the name of the testator had been inserted. The words "Ambrose Waring" falling from the reader's lips informed me that it was Kate Rosmond's uncle! I listened with profound attention, and was astounded at finding that the first copy I made, and not the second one, not the pretended correct one, was at this moment in the hands of the conveyancer. The sick man took it from the reader's hands at the conclusion, with the evident design of attempting to read it over himself; but an attack of suffocation came on, and he dropped it. The paper had not been folded up, as other legal documents were which I saw about the office.' It was on much thinner paper than most of them; and it was brought to this house, and into the room, laid in the leaves of a rough portfolio, made by stitching a half-quire or less of blotting-paper between the backs of such a book as I had recognized as an    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6869-00000120"/> 238      IN THE RAPIDS. index among my grandfather's relics at home. The conveyancer now took up the will and put it back in the portfolio, which lay spread open on the bed. I saw that the other witness was watching the sick man.  My own attention was turned altogether to Mr. Crown- rig. I observed that the forefinger of his left hand was inserted at the edge of the portfolio, between the leaves of the blotting-paper. He waited until the sick man again recovered, and then, closing the portfolio, still keeping the forefinger where it was, walked over to- wards the bureau. "Come back here, Crownrig," said the sick man, harshy. "What are you going to do?" "I am about to insert the date," replied the con- veyancer, who had drawn a pocket-inkstand from his pocket and gave it to the clerk to unscrew. "Bring it back here. Put it down here before me. Let me see what you write." The portfolio was accordingly brought back and put on the bed, opened as before. Inasmuch as Mr. Crownrig, in going to the bureau, held it before him and placed himself between me and it, I could not at the time say whether it had been reopened at the same place as before, or where his finger had been in- serted. What was really the case will appear in due time. The date then was inserted; almost under Mr. Waring's nose, and the pen handed to him to sign. "I've got a mind not to sign this, now. I'll be out before long, and it will all be to do over again. How- ever, here goes," he added, as if warned by the ap- proach of another paroxysm, which could not but   IN TH7 E RAPIDS.      239 remind him of the possibility of instant and sudden death. He then affixed his name, in a distinct hand and with considerable firmness. He was hardly through when he was again attacked; but this time he clutched the paper and held it until he was relieved. Mr. Crownrig beckoned to the young gentleman who came with us, and he walked over to the bedside and wrote his name as a witness. The pen was then handed to me. Aid not feel that I could conscien- tiously sign the paper without an effort at examining i it, and I accordingly turned back to the place where the pretended omission was made. Before I could fix my eye on the precise spot, Mr. Waring himself pulled the paper out of my hand, saying, in a very bad temper,- "What are you looking for? You only came here as a witness. It is none of your business to read it. You heard it read. Ain't that enough for you? Women have always more to do and say about things that don't concern 'em, than enough. Put your name down there; that's all I want with you." At the same moment I caught Mr. Crownrig's eye. It was expressive of the most violent anger. This, added to Mr. Waring's harshness, and the considera- tion of the unpleasant position I should occupy in case I should state and still be unable to confirm my sus- picions, and, finally, the want of the self-confidence required under such circumstances, all combined in inducing me to affix my name without further hesita- tion. I took up the pen and proceeded to do so. l  "That is not the way to spell Caroline," said MX    <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6869-00000121"/> 240      IN THE RAPIDS.  Crownrig, catching my arm as I finished my own first  name. The confusion I was under had made me forget  that, at the time, I was known by an assumed one.  "Do you not see that you have transposed two of the letters?" "He! he!" laughed the sick man, with a dry, harsh cackle. "You're a nice one to examine a will, and can't spell your own name." This unkind remark left me no desire at the mo- ment in regard to the matter, except to be done with it and get away out of the room. I altered the two wrong letters, and then finished writing the name by which I was known to the conveyancer. "I will deposit this for you --- said the latter, drying the signatures and folding up the paper. "No, sir!" exclaimed the testator, very decidedly, with a suspicious shake of his head, and a sharp, cun- ning twinkle of his eyes. "Young woman," he con- tinued, addressing me, "put your hand under the bolster, here, and find me a bunch of keys." I obeyed him, and he selected one, directing me to open with it a drawer in the upper part of the secretary bureau standing against the wall on the other side of the bed. Following his further instructions, I placed the will in the drawer, locked it, tried it, to be sure it was fastened, and returned the bunch of keys where I found them. I managed to get a look at Mr. Crownrig's face during this procedure. He turned very pale at first, but afterwards assumed a composed and satisfied expres- sion. After it was all over, he appeared to be very fidgety for an exit from the place. In bidding good-   "N THE RAPIDS.       241 by, he shook hands with the dying man, and in this was imitated by the clerk first, and then by myself, that I might not appear singular, or to harbor any resentment for the discourtesy I had suffered. The old man went through the ceremony as if he were very much disinclined to anything so profitless, anid appeared to regard it as a mere waste of exertion. We found the nurse at the door as we passed out; and she whispered that the doctor was not coming any more, and had said that Mr. Waring "might pop off at any - moment." We were joined by Mrs. Crownrig in the hall below, and went directly back to the office, where her hus- band immediately placed several days' work before me and gave me to understand that I was to lose no time in dispatching it. But I felt so uncomfortable, even wretched, over the affair of the morning, I felt so sure that I had been a party to some unfairness, to say nothing worse of it, that I made but small progress, and spent the better part of the remainder of that day in correcting repeated blunders. In passing out of the office as the tea-bell rang, the conveyancer and his clerks having previously vacated their apartments, I observed in the waste-paper basket, under Mr. Crown- rig's table, in the middle room, and on top of a mass of scraps which nearly filled it, a large number of shreds of a peculiar blue-tinted paper, similar in ap- pearance to that on which I had written the two copies of Mr. Waring's will. I picked out one or two of the shreds, and recognized my own handwriting. My first impulse was to go on and gather them all out; for they 21,-    <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6869-00000122"/> 242      IN THE RAPIDS. were undoubtedly the pieces of one of the two copies, and, if I could so arrange as to read them, my doubts would be resolved, one way or the other. It was no* time then to do so, however, and I went up-stairs. Mr. Crownrig, contrary to his custom since I had been in the house, spent the evening at home. I passed the time, until the hour for retiring, over a newspaper; for I have not the talent of joining in conversation with people in whom I have no confidence, and such the conveyancer and his wife had now become. The yellow fever was at this time desolating a Southern city. I had glanced but casually at the pub- lished notices of it, until this occasion, when I read with considerable care and interest the accounts given in the paper of the ravages of the pestilence and of the condition of the unfortunate place. So great had been the mortality that all business was suspended. Rows of houses had been made tenantless by death. The sound of a footstep was rare for hours together in entire streets. Rats paraded the footways, and, cross- ing from side to side, met as if in congratulation over the troubles of their human enemies. The hearses going their rounds, a physician, nurse, or clergyman hurrying from one scene of agony or death to an- other, were almost the only exterior evidences that presented themselves of mortal activity. The sky wore an aspect of unnatural gloom. The angel of desolation, with black, o'erreaching wing, shutting out the blessed light of heaven, seemed settling on the devoted city, to make it his abiding-place for ever- more.   X . '      IN THE RAPIDS.      2 243 Silent, however, as so many houses were, whose whilom cheerful dwellers now tenanted the grave, there were yet others whose silence gave awful notice of the struggle going on with the ubiquitous, fell destroyer. A cry came up to all the land for help, or none would be left to tell the tale,-physicians, nurses, and food, andcoffins, that the dead might be decently bestowed. Brave men and brave women, with courage shaming that of the battle-field, had gone, and labored and died, or been worn out, in the ghastly conflict. To turn from so much death and suffering to how much was done to stay the one and relieve the other, was the only change for the aching heart in this dreadful pic- ture. Most noticeable among these brave ones was a physician, the familiar use of whose name made it apparent that he had hastened among the first to give his meed of charitable effort. Unsurpassed in skill, untiring in his labors, gentle as a woman, performing the most menial offices, seeking out the poorest, cook- ing their food, feeding them, doing everything, being everywhere; save the pestilence, nothing so untiring, so ubiquitous, as he. His name was Manning. How my heart bounded, how my blood careered, at the word! What Manning? Was it my Manning? Was it Laurence? This intelligence, the hopes and doubts aroused by it, produced a condition of excitement and anxiety without parallel in the history of my feelings. Strange, perhaps, to say, it rather counteracted than increased the nervousness which had come over me in conse- quence of my position towards the conveyancer, and    <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6869-00000123"/> 244      IN THE, RAPIDS. my suspicion of his dishonesty. I was, in some sort, upheld between two opposing forces, and enabled to  act with, otherwise impossible, deliberation. Upon getting to my room, which was a back one, : in the third story, I could not make up my mind to go  to bed. I had such an eager desire to get hold of the scraps of paper alluded to, before the porter who  cleaned up the offices should have a chance of carry- ing them off, that it drove all feeling of sleep away. To descend two flights of stairs in the dark and bring.  the basket to my room presented itself as a hazardous undertaking. I had always found the office-doors un- locked in the morning, and did not think they were ever fastened; but I could not forget my confusion at one time in the dark, during the recent terrible night at home. Moreover, I had not sufficient light at my disposal to complete an examination of the scraps; and, again, the basket would have to be returned to the office, thus necessitating a repetition of the danger- ous journey down and up. In spite of all this hazard,  and remembering that a wax candle of considerable  length stood on the mantel in Mr. Crownrig's own  office, used for sealing packages, and which I might  get possession of, I determined to make an effort to satisfy myself. Removing my shoes, I opened my  door noiselessly, and, hearing not the slightest sound in any direction about the house, I commenced the descent. It would not be easy to convey a correct idea of the feeling of trepidation that came over me, increasing at every step I took. My knees shook under me; in fact, I trembled in every limb. As I   I-V 1 mI t HJU3/.    245 passed Mr. Crownrig's door, the atmosphere seemed to become filled with a general buzz, loud enough to awaken all in the house, and the least surprising thing would have been to see the conveyancer whip open his door and come out and face me. I involun- tarily turned back to look in its direction several times before I passed out of the line of it. I reached the lower hall in safety and without noise, though the time required to do it either was, or appeared to be, ten times greater than I had expected. Pausing an instant, to recollect the position of things in the room I wished to enter, I laid my hand on the knob of the door, turned it, and, finding my ingress not resisted by any further fastening, I made my way noiselessly in and got possession of the basket and candle with un- expected celerity. Leaving the door open, I ascended as far as Mr. Crownrig's door, quite quickly; but to pass that dreaded spot with the evidence of what I may call my guilt in my hands was doubly terrible to what it was before. It was accomplished not only with an increased trembling of my limbs, but an audible crack- ing of every joint in my body. I finally reached my room safely; but it was a long time before I could compose myself sufficiently to finish the task I had undertaken. My mind, however, was busily occupied in arranging the speediest plan for its completion. Having at length obtained control of my nerves, I picked out all the scraps from the basket, easily dis- tinguished by their peculiar tint from what else they were mixed with. Guided by one or more words on each piece, it was not difficult to tell to which sheet it 2 1* B,    <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6869-00000124"/> 246      IN THE RAPIDS. belonged, and I accordingly divided the scraps into  little piles, corresponding with the sheets; and the relative original position of each piece was located as well by the samei guide as by its shape. Numerous blunders occurred, notwithstanding, and, warned by the waning length of my candle, I postponed, for the present, all the sheets but the one concerned with the pretended omission, and which would decide which copy of the will was now before me. The result did not disappoint me. Beyond any doubt, I had now in my possession the identical paper which had been read to Mr. Waring, and which he had been led to suppose was signed by him and locked up by his direction in his secretary. If I have been sufficiently explicit, and my theory of Mr. Crownrig's conduct be correct, it has now been made manifest that both copies of the paper were taken to the testator's house; the correct one read to him, and at his disposal for examination, if necessary, i before signing; the altered copy adroitly substituted to receive the signatures of himself and the witnesses, with the hope that it would at once be put back in the conveyancer's hands, for deposit in some place which it happened he was interrupted in naming. The near approach of the testator's death, and Mr. Crownrig's management of his mendicant-looking clerk as well as of myself, had doubtless their place in the scheme. Stringing the thoroughly-arranged scraps on a strand of thread, to save future trouble in rearranging them, and packing up in separate parcels the remain- ing piles, I made my way out of the house at daylight,   IN THE RAPIDS.       247 and repaired to the hotel where I had stopped on first coming to the city. At a proper hour I went to the office of Mr. Cornell, as the only lawyer with whose name I was familiar or for whose address I could inquire. I learned from him that Mr. Waring had died the previous noon, his death being announced in the morning papers. I stated to him everything in regard to the matter as I have described it. Under his protection, and with his advice, I took the proper steps to bring the subject to the notice of the rightful tribunal. Beyond this, save guiding me from time to time in my conduct as a witness, that gentleman had no connection with the case. This is an exact and perhaps an over-tedious account of a matter which blazoned my name with renewed malignity before the public. It would be easier to say with what I was not, than with what I was, charged. Mr. Crownrig accused me of writing the copy of the will which I presented, and then tearing it up in order to give coloring to a story altogether fabri- cated. His clerk swore that his attention was dis- tracted from the reading of the will from time to time, and could say nothing as to the surreptitious clause. I was charged with conspiring with the heiress to defeat the object of the testator. My proper name of course became known. My use of an assumed one suggested a multitude of suspicions. The miserable pamphlet which had already given me so much trouble was republished, not as testimony, but to de- prive me of all character. An event hereafter to be related, happening before the case was closed, received    <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6869-00000125"/> 248      IN THE RAPIDS. unlimited publicity and an endless multiplication of malicious comment. Nearly the whole city press was employed for months and months in defaming me in the interest of the objects of the will. If I had a brain of granite and a heart of adamant, they ought to have been riven by these ceaseless, unmerciful blows. A few temperate articles, written by Mr. Cornell in my behalf, cost as much as if they had been printed with types of gold which perished in the service. They suggested the thought of how much more might be said, and led to the collecting of some disconnected pages, previously written for mere pastime, and their embodiment in a connected recital. I will be par- doned for having unburdened my mind of thoughts and strayed into the description of scenes not alto- gether relevant. Even if you have no bread for the beggar, he will thank you to listen to his story. If all other charity has departed from you, you will not refuse him a few costless flowers to decorate his rags withal, nor grudge him the enjoyment of their perfume. Though intermingling, in the matter of time, and even passing beyond, what remains to be related of myself, I will at once follow the fortunes of Kate Rosmond as far as I know them, as well as the affair of her uncle's will, making no subsequent interrup- tion by reference to them. In regard to the will itself, inasmuch, to use the language of the legal gentleman to whom I referred the matter, it was "not admitted to probate," it will be sufficient to say that by it the whole of Mr. War- ing's vast property was left to certain named trustees,   IN THE RAPIDS.       249 ostensibly for charitable and educational objects, to be detained in their hands, however, for the purpose of accumulation and reaccumulation, through a long series of years, before being applied to the objects for which it was devised. The latter part of the scheme was decided by competent authority to be not only impracticable but illegal, and better calculated to diminish than to increase the original property, by filtration through the hands of trustees, commission- ers, and agents. It was agreed upon all sides that Mr. Waring, leaving no one of his blood worthy to inherit from him, deserved no credit for the ostensible pur- poses on which he bestowed his property, so promi- nent was his motive for being known to have died, as he expressed it to me, " a rich man,-a very rich man," and to keep his name as such before the world as long as possible. His selection for trustees was pointed to sustain this view; for, without consulting thdm, he had picked out men among the highest in science, literature, and business, some of them wealthier than himself, but wealthier by riches that had made no man poorer, had sharpened no visage in their accumulation, but had verily grown greater by intelligent liberality; and had brought to them many a blessing where his had wrung out many a curse. No one disputed that these men were named for the honor they deserved, which all the world accorded to them, and that his name might reflect it by connection with theirs. The surreptitious copy, doubtless given to me to draw up in order that, being in my handwriting, I might be induced to swear to it without examining    <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6869-00000126"/> 250      IN TItE RAPIDS. it, and my li/mited experience counted upon to fail me in tracing the discrepancy through-the various proceedings,-this copy contained a clause, expressed in a few lines, releasing, in general terms, one Harvey Crownrig from all debts due by him to the testator. The name occupied a blank space left for it by me according to the sketch, but was found filled up in writing resembling mine somewhat, but the difference could be recognized by careful examination. Evil men are rarely wise even in their own direct interest. If this copy had been given to me first, and the sketch altered to suit the other one afterwards, and no attempt made to foist, with a show of ill humor, an error upon me which it was ridiculous to say was mine, I should not, in all probability, have imbibed any suspicion of wrong. Undoubtedly the one which I would in that case have been induced to suppose the correct one, and the one read to Mr. Waring, would have been the same. I would not have suspected, and of course would not have watched for, the substitution that took place. The property, save what went into the pockets of her good friends the lawyers, ultimately fell into the possession of Kate Rosmond. Well may one start at such a finale, already clearly indicated by the fore- going events. It is horrible to contemplate to what ends of wickedness such vast wealth might be turned in her hands, circumstanced as I had left her. But it is not the first case in which Providence has interfered to bring good out of evil. At the time of going to Mr. Cornell's office I had not known but that Mr.   Hii     ---v jrIl  - U;i LAI.   251 Waring was still living, and had but a very confused idea of what the result would be if he were not. That gentlemran very soon made it plain to 'me, and I. learned from his information that the condition of the estate was familiar to many of the legal fraternity. As has been seen, some were found ready to trace out and undertake the interests of the heiress. Kate was found at the house in which I left her.  But in what condition! During one of those feats hxich she described as of unconscious daring, her horses, driven to an uncontrollable speed, had dashed out of the arena, up among the spectators. They broke through, or crushed down, the benches and their sup- ports. Horses and rider, people, timber, and planks, suddenly disappeared, as if into the mouth of a crater, a confused, floundering, shrieking, groaning mass. Two persons were taken out dead from under the body of one of the:horses, whose forelegs were broken. Many were more or less injured. An infant was killed in its mother's arms by a hoof of one of the animals. Kate was found apparently lifeless. Lifted up on the back of the remaining horse, which had escaped without injury to his limbs, and stretched out, face upwards, her arms folded across her breast, and feet held together, she was thus conducted, between two files of her admiring and distressed fellow-actors, and not without circumstance of melancholy ceremony, into the dressing-room. She was not dead, however; and consciousness soon returned to her, for she had an iron constitution, and a brain to withstand almost any distress of body. "When can I ride again?" was    <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6869-00000127"/> 252      IN THE RAPIDS. her first question. Paralyzed from her waist down- wards, her right arm crushed beyond all skill of sur- gery to save it from amputation,-when would she ride again? Probably regarding this catastrophe as a righteous visitation from an offended Providence, and, let it be hoped, ultimately from that loftier sense of contrition which arises from the love and not from the fear of the Almighty, she became not the spendthrift, but the simple dispenser in charity, of her uncle's fortune. Re- tiring to an humble abode, using the coarsest clothing and the simplest fare for herself, she sent trusty and carefully-selected agents about in search of good to be done and suffering to be relieved. Her uncle's means, in her hands, have bestowed more practical benefits in a year than had been given by his hands in alll his lifetime, or than would have flowed from his will had it been carried out. She has not helped to raise con- testing steeples of palatial churches. She has not subscribed for tae purchase of church-organs; for she once heard an ai from "Faust" played as a wedding- march from the altar. But more than one humble and useful chapel in the wilderness has been built, from foundation-stone to combing, with her money. She does not assist in sending the gospel to the heathen: she remembers that "the poor you have always with you." God forbid that her story should tempt any one to follow her into guilt with the hope of being led out of it by her retracing footsteps! She sinned with the full power of a strong nature. Let it be remembered that   nIV THE RAPIDS.      2 5 3 only a strong nature can be relied upon for thorough, consistent, and permanent repentance.

T RETURN now to my own immediate history, and to the morning on which I quitted Mr. Crown- rig's house. I procured at once a file of the news- paper which contained what I have related of the pestilence in a Southern city. An eager perusal of it left me no doubt that the Laurence Manning alluded to was the long-missing idol of my heart. He had been stricken down with the fever, and was thought to be dying. A notice of him appeared, minutely de- scribing him, giving his full name and probable age. Never was portrait drawn with stronger ascription of every manly, heroic, endearing quality. Did I not say, "No, no! not cruel. Wait, wait!"Subsequent and continuous accounts recorded his recovery and followed him with admiring interest, in his unremit- ting and too early renewed devotion to his merciful work. Not forgetting that I have been on the point of sub- ordinating my devotion to this man to the general yearning of nature which formed so great a part of it, nor that I have contemplated the possibility, at least, of sacrificing it to material considerations affecting myself and others by a union, or the form of one, not to be described in my view of it, because I will not make use of thewords required to do so,-leaving (254)    I/A THE RAPIDS.      255 those who believe that our love is the reflex of our selfishness, to draw therefrom what support they may,-I show a return to consistency-to consistent folly, if you will-by the resolution now formed to go at once to the scene of his labors. It might be to meet death. How weak were the claims of life, divested of the interest imparted by him to it, on my attachment! What was due to self-respect, to the dignity and the purity of the feeling actuating me, to my mother,-all these were duly remembered and considered. But I would go. He might be again stricken down with the fever. Either in disguise or known to him, I could nurse him. Often, the least little thing, properly done, at a critical moment, has brought back the life hovering on the brink of eternity. What eye was there to see, what hand to do, for him with such precision as mine? To behold him and hear his voice again, now that he was found, was an uncontrollable necessity, an aching, absorbing, impera- tive anxiety. Lifted up to the height of hope again, painful, pitiful though the acknowledgment is, reason was tottering, and might fall under continued suspense. Sinning against what or whomsoever I might be by attempting it, it were sinning against myself not to attempt the only possibly complete relief. I wrote a letter to mother, to take with me, for transmission to her in case I should be in extreme danger of death. Having ascertained the expenses of the journey, I reserved so much from my small remain- ing stock of money, and spent the meagre balance in a few needful articles of clothing. They made, with    <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6869-00000129"/> 256       Ir THE RAPIDS. the surplus things I had before, a package no larger than I could carry in my hand. Taking a grateful leave of the kind landlord, and denying myself the use of a carriage, I left the hotel in time to reach the starting- point on foot. Passing, on my way, around by the front entrance of the house, I heard a gentleman, standing oh the steps, accost another, just come up, with the ques- tion,- "What's the news from the fever?" "Manning's taken down again," was the reply. Nothing more was asked. Nothing was added to the reply. Interest in him appeared to have rendered all other intelligence unworthy to be&amp;inquired for or to be repeated. It was the news I expected and dreaded. More reason why I should go. I hurried away. Continuing on for several squares, I observed a crowd gathered around a bulletin of one of the news- offices.' I lingered near for awhile, to learn if there were any further report. "What is it?" said one, who could not get near enough to read, to another, just emerged, after a struggle, from the centre of the crowd. "Why, Manning." "What of him?" "He's dead." The questioner and the answerer drooped their heads and walked away in moody silence, as if each felt the grief of a personal calamity. Bereft, for the moment, of strength to move, I lis-   iNv TIlE RA PID/S.     257 tened to learn if the news had been read aright. Too many repeated it to leave it doubtful. The crowd gradually thinned away. Passers-by drew up in ones and twos, read the announcement, and went their way. A few lingered awhile, conversing with dejected faces, and then departed. By-and-by, none from the busy throng, hurrying to and fro, stopped to look on. The stolid bqard stood solitary, with his name and death spread out upon it, as if it were a tombstone marking his deserted grave. I, too, turned from the spot, losing the cruel words to view indeed, but they were graven on the shrine of his image. Thus was I lifted up by a new impulse given to his passion, which, more times than I have confessed it, has shaken my every fibre by its impetuous, un- heralded onset, making me tremble with mingled de- light and dread by its fulness, its delirious absorption, its power, and its mystery,-thus was I lifted up to a height that afforded a transient recall of my old visions of happiness. Thus was I cast down, bruised and grovelling again, in unutterable wretchedness, on the miserable earth. Utterly prostrated by the occurrences just related, I lost the courage and energy necessary to sustain me in my present isolated position. I was weary of the great, busy, noisy, unsympathizing city. My heart was bursting with grief, and there was none to whom I could unburden it. My mind, deprived of interchange of thought, having no variety but that afforded by the succession of one disappointment or trouble to another, was turning upon itself. I needed 22*    <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6869-00000130"/> 258      IN THE RAPIDS. the comfort of mother's presence, surrounded by no matter what difficulty. Notwithstanding that there was much about home which it was desirable to for- get, it was still hallowed by many sweet memories. With these to feed upon and receive fresh vigor from, my mind might be stronger to meet the troubles from which I had fled, than it now was to bear its own dis- order. Natural concern about affairs at home was redoubled by the absence of information in regard to them. Measuring the resistance possible to be exerted in my behalf, anywhere, by the limited estimate which recent events had induced me to put upon my own powers of action and endurance, there was no con- dition too deplorable for my imagination to attribute to the only ones whom the earth now held near and dear to me. Determined to return, then, I concluded to seek information on one subject before doing so. From the remark dropped by my mother in relation to the difficulty of obtaining money, I suspected that my father's troubles were altogether of a pecuniary char- acter. I had readily recognized Mr. Cornell as the lawyer who accompanied Mr. Baxter on the occasion of his first visit, and, the observation made by Mrs. Victor at the time recurring to me, I did not doubt . that it was in his power to throw some light on the unhappy subject. I accordingly repaired to his office on the morning succeeding the announcement of Laurence's death. I was surprised at the amount of his information in regard to the matter. He replied to my inquiries, in substance, as follows:-   N I THE RAPIDS.      259 "I am counsel for the English branch of your grandfather's family. As such, it has been my duty to watch your estate for many years. In searching for information upon another subject, I became aware of your father's difficulties. Though employed and regularly paid by the other side, neither my views of my duty nor of their wishes require me to conceal any fact of which you ought to be made aware. "Your grandfather left no will. Some years before his death he conveyed to your father a life-estate in the property he now occupies. You were not born at the time of this conveyance. Your father failing of issue, the estate would have gone, at his death,. to the English branch. As it is, it becomes yours, when he dies, on certain conditions. These conditions, as well as the confining your father to a life-estate, seem to have had their origin in precaution of your or your father's prodigality or want of good management, as well as in the thoroughly British notion of sending down a continually accumulating fortune through the hands of first-born children, as far as the laws of this country will allow. Your entering upon the estate depends upon your being entirely free from debt, upon your not having charged it directly or indirectly with an anticipatory lien for obligations, incurred for yourself or others, and (as if these restrictions did not comprehend it) especially such as would arise from your father's over-spending his handsome income. I have already stated what seems to have been the cdesign of these restrictions, as it would appear to any one from a bare mention of the facts. The immediate    <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6869-00000131"/> 260      IN THE RAPIDS. motive was your father's marriage, as I have learned from foreign sources. Through the connivance of her family, and against the will of his, he married your mother. She was penniless, but brought him a long- descended inheritance of family pride, and elevated-I may say extravagant-notions of refinement and taste, qualities the most obnoxious to mere accumulators of wealth. "This case, like Mr. Waring's, shows what errors a man may commit by endeavoring to retain a pro- longed control over his affairs after death has re- laxed his natural hold upon them.  Your father is a debtor of the elder Mr. Brandon for a large amount. This could arise from no ordinary cause. Upon investigation, followed up very recently by directions from a quarter not to be named to you, it appears that he has been engaged in speculations for some time, which were successful at first, but afterwards heavily involved him. From several interviews which he has recently granted me, and an examination of his papers, together with collateral information of Mr. Brandon's operations, it is evident that he has lost by purchases and sales of public stocks,--the identical transactions resulting in Mr. Brandon's gain; for he bought when your father sold, and sold when he bought. Your father's habits of mind preclude the possibility of his having acted on his own motion in these matters, and Mr. Brandon is too sagacious a man to be known as his direct adviser in affairs which have resulted, as I have no doubt it was intended from the beginning that they should result, in placing him   IN THE RAPIDS.        26I in his power. The agent, or broker, as the term is, of his creditor's gains, was also that of the losses made by your father, advised by this man to his injury, in consideration of the comparatively small resulting profit to himself. Plain-speaking people, like you and I, would give such a man a very hard name. The general world, however, considers his occupation, no matter how followed so that it leads to wealth, as highly respectable. So glaring a case as the one in point is not common; but small transactions equally heinous in principle are of daily occurrence. To make good these losses, your father borrowed money from Mr. Brandon, securing him, in part, at first, by mortgaging his income for several years to come. He is now merely the tenant of his creditor, who holds the purse supplying the daily wants of the family. Continued loans have to be obtained, as there is, at this time, no tangible income to meet expenses: of course the involvement increases. I regret to say that your father has been tempted or ignorantly led to give obligations binding himself to transfer, and setting forth that he possesses, an interest in the estate, comprising his own present, and your prospective right. The papers, drawn up by the virtuous Crown- rig, are a mass of cunning verbiage, concealing much of their import from an unpractised eye or ear, and it is probable that the signer is guiltless of any inten- tional wrong, while he has, in fact, laid himself open to a charge of fraud. It is this that his creditor now holds in terror over him. If I have clearly explained the nefarious conduct of the rascally broker, unfortunately    <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6869-00000132"/> 262       IN THE RAPIDS. beyond the reach of the law, you understand that Mr. Brandon has parted with no money save his agent's fees, while your father is legally his debtor for an amount which it is impossible for him to pay. By your grandfather's management you are powerless to help him. I have been made aware of the designs entertained in regard to the younger Mr. Brandon and yourself. It is the redress which his father proposes to himself. It is the means to which he looks for bringing into his, family a property, of his debtor's tenure in which, he was, in the beginning, probably ignorant. 'It grieves me to give the opinion that the charge of fraud could be sustained. The loans were always made in presence of witnesses, and everything is properly attested. Whether the debtor would ulti- mately press the charge is another question. He is an unmerciful, vindictive man, however; and, as the matter now stands, your choice is between sacrificing yourself or your father. The latter has promised the amends demanded by his creditor, if in his power to command them; and, owing either to confusion of ideas or the personal influence of the man who has involved him, he is not willing to look for any relief save that which you can afford him,-if there be any other, which, as I now view the case, I think there is not." What I have here written down of Mr. Cornell's reply to me is an exact copy of so much of a letter, which I transmitted to mother soon after quitting his office. I felt compelled to suspend all thought upon it until I could see her. Having thus announced my intended return, I set f  '   IN THE RAPIDS.       263 out next day, leaving unsettled trouble behind me, and carrying trouble homeward in my own person, to add to that of others already sufficiently afflicted. My meeting with mother was painful beyond my powers of description. She was wasted to a shadow. Her sorrowful, anxious eyes looked double their natural size, from the attenuation of her face. It was easy to see that her hopes of peace from my absence had been disappointed. She fell upon my neck, bursting into tears, and hugging me as if her life depended, for the moment, upon pressing me closely to her bosom, ex- claiming only, "My child, my child!"My determina- tion to be calm gave way at finding what a shattered wreck I was clasping in my arms. My father, coming in at the moment, redoubled my emotion by a dis- play of feeling too deep and manifest not to be returned. One impression immediately produced by this meet- ing was, that I, and not my parents, must decide my course of action. The responsibility was mine, because my will was left entirely free. Compulsion was not possible, nor would it be resorted to if it were, on one side; on the other, the obvious undermining of mental power by disease and affliction placed me in a position rather to guide 'than to be controlled: this is the gentlest way of expressing the rapid, positive change in my mother during my absence. The earnest, joyous greeting of Therese would have brought tears to less accustomed eyes than mine; nor was her honest scolding of me, for having left without bidding her good-by, less affecting. The ex-    <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6869-00000133"/> 264       IN THE RAPIDS. pression of restored content coming to the dear old face of this faithful negress at my few kind words of explanation and regret, did not pass unenvied. Where could I turn and hear anything said so effective in my behalf? I would cheerfully have exchanged my lot for hers. Let the opinion of mankind deny her what it might, here it could mark her for no unjust distinc- tion in the future life, to which this is not so much as the dropping of a grain of sand in the ever-turning glass of eternity; and, in the narrow span of earthly existence, wherein was she not more blessed than I? Her meagre intelligence and faint sensibilities, dulled still more by age, limited her to a sphere of duty whose obligations were within her power, and of observation creating no cares or wants not readily eased or satisfied. Education and studied refinement afforded me countless enjoyments of which she was ignorant; but was she not spared the heart-piercings which the least rude touch upon acute and wide- spread sensibilities sent to its very core? As for the charm of youth, so precious, so desirable to be pro- longed and renewed when happiness has attended it,  or success, even without happiness, has waited upon the expansion of its powers, I would gladly have parted with it, to be as near as she to Lethe's forgetful shore. A return to the material comforts of home and its unrestrained mode of life, and the lessening of the range of thought produced by a precise knowledge of the nature of the trouble hanging over its inmates, restored somewhat for a time my balance of mind.   INV THEA KAPIDhS.      265 But I soon again fell into those wearying, ener- vating speculations which preceded my departure, and already, perhaps too much, dwelt upon. Everything being now known, my father talked freely enough; but, as Mr. Cornell said, he would look to no relief except that to be afforded by me, because he would not admit the feasibility of a resort to any other. He denied all intention of wrong, and said he understood nothing in the papers beyond the obligation to pay the sums named.  My mother, embittered by her own ill- assorted marriage, never varied from her refusal to agree to my entering into a worse one. "Patience, patience," was her cry. "They can gain nothing by a prosecution. We can wear them out by persist- ence." Mr. Brandon resumed his visits, and his presence made the subject one of daily discussion, without result, save its increasing injurious effects upon the health and peace of my parents and myself. The light in which the change in my father pre- sented him to me, compelled me to allow him equal claim with my mother to my consideration, on the simple score of filial duty. He would be sacrificed by my continued refusal; she might be, by my consent. There remained to be thrown into the balance what was due to myself. Death, in any shape, was prefera- ble to what was asked of me; and the thought that it must speedily follow my submission was not without its weight in favor of submitting. But was it not my feelings which presented in such horrible aspect a question which I was endeavoring to decide altogether in the forum of reason? Putting them aside, then, if a 23    <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6869-00000134"/> 266      IN THE RAPIDS. woman ever can, and acting solely upon my reason, if a woman ever does, nothing remained in the way of my consent but one thought, and that was, the guiltiness in her own conscience and before Heaven of a woman occupying the relation of wife to a man who she wishes were not her husband. The ceremony of marriage may deprive it of the scandal and example of a crime. Of its moral turpitude I could not dissuade myself This thought held me back, while the influ- ences I have mentioned dragged me forward. A man stretched upon the rack may get some peace from the stupor of the nerves arising from excessive and pro- longed torture. I had none. I do not know if it is peculiar to me, but I have fre- quently felt an impulse to do a thing, followed by the occurrence of controlling reasons against it, and these followed by a renewal of the impulse sweeping on like a returning wave, submerging my judgment and driving me to an action not defensible. Hitherto it had oc- curred in matters attended by no material consequence.  One afternoon, in the second week of my return, I took my horse, which had come safely back on the i night of my departure, for. a short ride, not for any  pleasure to myself in the exercise, but to renew my  companionship with him. Following a bridle-road in a walk for a couple of miles, I was about approach-  ing a cross-path, when I heard voices of persons  coming down it towards me, and I turned into the woods to avoid them. They proved to be my father and Mr. Brandon. The latter was talking and gestic- ulating violently. The former uttered but a word or   IN THE RAPIDS.       267 two occasionally. His appearance, however, of which I got only an instant, though a distinct, view, spoke eloquently enough of distress. He wore a cowed, browheaten expression. His lower eyelids were dragged down from his eyes, unduly exposing the white of them, and giving them the look of unnerving terror so striking in persons of large, heavy visage. Under such an impulse as I have described, and with like attendant mental action, I turned back into the road, overtook them, and said,- "Father, if my marriage will release you from your obligations, and make you a free man again, I am ready for the sacrifice. But bear me witness that itis with loathing and detestation of the man beside you so intense as to be inexpressible. Let it be at once- to-morrow, at farthest, so that I may not be exposed to a moment's unnecessary reflection." Without waiting for a word in reply, and having looked into the face of neither, while speaking, I rode away. Turning into the road on the ridge, upon which I had taken the last ride with Mr. Baxter, I gave my eager horse the rein and dashed away at a reckless pace through the woods and out on the public road, regardless of the direction or of the distance which fast-coming night would find me from home. I was scarcely conscious of my object; but if I had any it was to reach a speed so rapid that the thought of preserving my life in such a headlong race might drown all others? A The horse slackened his pace and finally came to a dead halt, of his own accord, remind- ing me how fast I must have ridden him. The road    <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6869-00000135"/> 268      IN TILE RAPID9S. D I had taken ran parallel with the shore of the bay, and c was about a mile distant from it. Instead of returning ] as I came, I sought the smooth, hard beach, where I ] could have an hour more of light than in the woods,  and a safer footing for the horse, if it should get quite dark before reaching home. I kept on quite rapidly, and reached the point where the peninsula began, while there was still light enough to distinguish ob-  jects as far down as the Lookout. Instead of turning at once up to the house, I kept on towards the Look-  out, in order to go home by the river shore. The wish to maintain the excitement of my resumed rapid mo- tion may explain it. I had never been out so late before, alone, and I was perfectly mindful how troubled mother would be at my absence. Just as I turned my horse towards the Lookout, I observed a boat ap-  proaching the beach, quite close to it. Two or three  more strokes of the oars, and she struck on the sand. j The indistinct outlines of a vessel were visible some dis-  tance away, her sails still set, but hanging lazily from the yards, as there was not a breath of wind stirring at the moment. Turning my attention again to the boat,  I saw that the two rowers had sprung out, while a third person was at the moment stepping over the gunwale. It was a rare occurrence for any one to land at this point, and I stopped to watch which di- rection these persons would take, determining to return  if they came towards me. So long as they remained in a position for the water to form a background to them, I could observe their motions with considerable distinctness. But as they left the shore I became un-   IN THE RAPIDS.       269 certain. It was soon apparent, however, that, though having followed the bay shore for a distance, they had crossed this side of the Lookout and had taken the river beach. I resumed my way, at a pace which would keep them well ahead of me, if they continued on to the house or beyond it,-and the latter is what I reasonably expected would be the case. I had quit the hard beach, and was on the soft sand above it, close to the line of trees, inasmuch as if they were conversing I could hear them through it when'they would pass me, and thus have a fair idea of their movements. At the time, any incident which diverted my mind from myself was welcome. Differently cir- cumstanced, I would have turned back at not hearing them within a reasonable time. I'felt-safe in any event. As I reached the end of the line of trees, I made a detour, so as not to get too near to them in case they had stopped. The reflection from the water deceived me as to how dark it really was immediately around me. I gained the river shore by a wide sweep, and again took to the soft sand close to the trees on that side, and was soon after startled by hearing a few quick words from excited voices approaching me; and presently two men ran past me in eager haste. It was then too dark to distinguish more than that they were of the height of the two rowers of the boat. The third person was not with them; nor did he follow them, as I expected to see him do every moment. Wickedness had lately become such a familiar thing that every action I could not at once clearly under- stand filled me with apprehension. I concluded that ,* 23              .     l    <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6869-00000136"/> 270      ZN THE RAPIDS. I had been observed by these persons, and that they had divided themselves so as to prevent my reaching home or returning. Acting upon this thought, I im- mediately sought the hard beach again, and put my horse into a run, as the best means of passing any ob- struction which might be offered to my progress. Half the length of the shore traversed in this way, and my horse suddenly sprang to one side and gave a snort of terror. I was so far dislodged by his erratic motion as to have to clutch his mane to keep myself from falling to the ground. The docile animal stopped to enable me to regain my seat. In that moment of delay I heard a smothered moan in the direction of the spot where he had taken fright. Instantly it flashed across my mind that the still missing third man was the victim of foul work, instead of a partici- pator in it. All fear for myself vanished. I rode back, and, though I could not bring my horse up close to it, I distinguished a black object lying partly on the shore and partly in the water. Bending down as low as possible, and my eyes becoming better accustomed to the darkness, I could trace out, defined against the white sfd, the upper portion of a man's figure. My first impulse was to make some attempt to assist or relieve him, but a feeling of sickening horror came over me, which decided me to hurry home for help  more serviceable than mine. I sped onward, then, as fast as possible, alighted at the gallery steps, ran up them, through the gallery1 and into mother's library, where I found my father and the doctor conversing. What was the matter? What had brought the doctor d    IN THE RAPIDS.       271 there? My protracted absence had so alarmed my mother that she was threatened with an attack of her old illness. All that was possible had already been done to help her. This news added so much to my excitement that I could scarcely convey a knowledge of what I had seen, or give directions how to find the injured, perhaps dying, man. At length, however, the kind and always self-collected doctor drew from me, by a series of questiQos, the necessary information, and he and my father, gathering the servants, hurried down to the beach. I hastened in to mother. Though drowsy under the influence of a powerful opiate, she recognized me, and, becoming entirely calm under the assurance of my safety, she fell into a profound slumber. In about an hour I heard the lower gate from the beach open, and going out on the gallery I saw that a body was being borne into the house. My father came into the room soon after, and said that the man was still living, but that no opinion had been expressed as to his condition by the doctor. After the lapse of several hours, the latter came to have a look at mother on his way home, .nd said that a single but very severe blow on the back of the head was the only injury re- ceived by the rescued traveller, and that undisturbed quiet for a few days would place him out of danger. Who was he? He was still unconscious, and, as rob- bery had evidently been the object of the attack, he had been deprived of everything by which he might be identified. I felt an unaccountable curiosity about him, and a desire to see him, which nothing but my mother's condition prevented me from satisfying. But    <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6869-00000137"/> 272      IN THE RAPIDS. it was impossible to forget how indispensable my at-  tention proved to her recovery on a previous occasion,  and I resolved not to leave her.          1 I had not inquired if my mother had been made aware of my assent to the marriage she so much ab- horred. It was clear, however, that she had not, or I would have learned it from herself. Having con- cluded that it was inevitable, I determined not to delay  it beyond the following day, if her condition would  then admit of my absence for a sufficient length of  time. I regarded it in some sort as fortunate that it 4 must be kept from her at the time. I would not have been proof against any appeal from her in her situa- tion. I had not looked an instant into the future since my assent was given, nor would I until nothing to be seen in it would avail against the sacrifice. The dead quiet that succeeded the hush of all the noises about the: house was a sore trial. The struggle to drive away the crowd of thoughts pressing for entrance into my distracted brain so unnerved me that I could with difficulty refrain from hysterical shrieks. If any one ever did voluntarily labor to bring on such  a chaos of the mind as would destroy both recollection and anticipation, I did it that night. The thoughts I would drive away ceased to be things seeking access to my brain. They became demons dancing with hideous laugh and jeer around me,-demons climbing up the bedposts, sitting on the headboard, dancing on mother's coverlet, crawling from under the bed, sit- ting in all the chairs, pouring in at the doors, spring- ing in at the windows, hanging down from the ceiling, dI1   IN THE RAPIDS.       273 packing me around, poisoning the air with their fetid  breath, and filling it with a thousand infernal lights from their hellish eyes. To escape the hideous crowd, I ran through the library and into the gallery to the gate. The night-breeze came up cool from the water and fanned my hot temples, giving me one refreshing moment, and then the terrible crew came rushing after and on before me, filling the woods and lining the now strangely visible shore. The scorching light of their eyes illumined woods and beach and water. They suddenly all divided off into pairs, and became so many sailors, each two throwing a wounded man into the water, who struggled out only to be thrown back again. The upturned face of this man had the look of Manning! In the midst of my frenzy there was a single instant of reason, during which a thought, a hope, a flash of wild possibility, stood out in relief from amidst all the horror, and I would have seized upon it, to steady my brain in the whirling confusion, but it was gone, and nothing but horror remained. I heard mother's voice, and ran back to the room. I gave her mechanically a dose of her opiate, and she was asleep again in a moment. The soothing relief afforded her by the medicine tempted me to use it. It induced a stupor, which was not sleep, and left me barely enough of consciousness to keep me in mind that there was a serious charge upon my hands, compelling me to re- main in the room. The terrible night passed b With daylight came an aching but resisted desire for slumber; and upon this followed an occasionally interrupted suspension of my    <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6869-00000138"/> 274       IN THE RAPID S.  faculties. The doctor came. My appearance struck him with surprise and concern. He insisted upon my leaving the room and taking rest, promising to re- main some hours in the house, dividing his attention between my mother and the wounded stranger. I was sensible enough to know that this was exactly what would most serve my purpose, and so complied. But, as to sleeping, I didn't even attempt it. I remember my father approaching and conversing with me, and my being put into the carriage and taken away from the house. There was a sense of onward motion, the sound of wheels and of horses' feet,-a church-door, vacant pews and aisles, a lighted altar, and a robed clergyman. After awhile some sonorous but meaningless words sounded in my ears, and then what I stood upon seemed rapidly sinking downward with me, and the darkness of blindness came before me. I still heard the sonorous but meaningless words. Suddenly my sight seemed restored. The altar and the clergy- man became visible again. A vestry door on the right opened, and my mother stood on the threshold. Her hair was dishevelled, and blood was on her lips and on her snowy gown. With arms uplifted and hands clinched in forbidding deprecation, she came around inside the railing towards me. Her eyes glared un- deviatingt full upon me, and her expression was one of never-to-be-forgotten, overawing severity. She came on, and stood between me and the clergyman. She lowered her clinched hands, and, leaning them upon the railing before her, bent over towards me. Her face was so close to mine that I should have felt    IN 7HE RAPIDS.       275 the breath coming from her moving but silent lips. But I felt not the warm breath of life. A cold, damp air, as from a sepulchre, struck upon my cheek. She raised herself erect again, withdrew her hands from the railing, and kept on past me. I strove to follow her. But hands that seemed 'to burn into my flesh detained me. I turned to tear them off, and, turning back to follow my mother, I could no longer see her. She had vanished. Blindness came again over me. The loss of every other sense followed. How long after I do not know, I was carried home. I felt no ,motion. I heard no sound. I only know that mother's room was the first I sought. There she lay, dead. Her hands were clinched, her hair was dishevelled, and blood was on her lips and on her snowy gown. I caught her hands in mine. A ring upon my finger, claslied with one on hers. I looked. It was my wedding-ring. I tore it off and dashed it away. I know nothing more of that day, nor of many days after.   <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6869-00000139"/> CHAPTER XIX. E SCAPED from my sleeping nurse, and either acting upon the only relieving thought of the first night of my frenzy, or flying from an undefined terror, reason returned at the sound of Manning's re- assuring voice. Willingly believing, at first, that the grave had opened me a pathway to him in the spirit-  world, the reality came in its time. He was sitting at the foot of his bed, facing an open window. The pillows, propped against the post, sus- tained his bandaged, weary head. One arm lay lan- guid on the bed. He alternately smoothed and patted one of my trembling hands, and was saying, "What has frightened Cora? What is the matter with my darling?" when I recognized the voice. I had not been so bereft but that I tasted the gall with the honey of this forbidden but unrejected kindness. "My Cora, my darling!"Who, that ought, would thus address me in this wide world again? To sit at the feet of the man who had inspired so deep a love that in my wicked weakness I dared not trust its consummation to the will of Heaven; to feel that a ceremony diverted by its circumstances from a sacrament to a crime, forbade its expression, nay, its longer presence in my heart; to be conscious, still, that the broad earth contained no one in whose behalf ( 276)   IN THE RAPIDS.       " I would refrain from death or any suffering that a hair of his head might not be touched; to know that a cry went up to him from my inmost soul, to save me from a horror undefined and unspeakable; to feel and know all this, and to remember that the staying of unkind fortune's hand for one opportune hour would have made us both happy,-was it not enough to break any heart? The moonlight poured in at the open window, and bathed his pallid, sunken features in its silvery and so bright a light that I saw the pulsation of the veins in the constricted temples. The old fascination beamed from his dark, unfathomable eyes, their fire, that whilom flashed out in anger which did not inspire me with fear, subdued by the heavy droop of the lids. "What have you learned, Laurence, since you came?" Nothing, Cora, save your mother's death and your consequent illness." "Why came you the way you did, and exposed yourself to assassination on the lonely beach?" "Merely to prolong access to the sea-air, to which I had resorted for strength after my partial recovery; and I was, in fact, too weak to travel hither by any other means. Had I not encountered the vessel that brought me, and learned the course of her voyage, I would not have started even now." "You ought to have much to tell me, Laurence, even in palliation of some things of which I do not complain. And, if it give you pain, let it pass. I 24    <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6869-00000140"/> 278      IN THE RAPIDS.   I   THlE RAAPIDS.      279   have never upbraided you, never murmured. I will not say I have forgiven you. It would argue a sense of wrong. I do not, did not, feel the thought, and must not use the word towards you. We have been long apart, and you should have much to say. Let me listen." "If you knew my nature, Cora, as well as I under- stand yours, you would pity me for the anguish -I have suffered for your wrongs. You pardon me too easily. It is a proof of how much I am to blame. But there are qualities in our nature controlling us against our conscience, and inherited ideas, as well, are our mas- ters, in the face of contradicting reason. You have heard and read of men and women driven to sacrifice themselves in marriage, or by abstaining from it to gratify the pride of ancestry or of wealth, the behests of religion, or the exactions of fanaticism. My errors and your injury are owing to the tyranny of trans- mitted intellectual ambition-an idea-a phantasy--a mere dream. "To investigate the nature of those elements of our making up which are not mortal, and the problem of human destiny, have been the enthusiastic, absorbing study of my forefathers for generations. The expe- rience gained by the study has been the inheritance, its continued pursuit a sacred charge, and its neglect a malediction, for each succeeding son. The best-con- sidered theories I have read, to say nothing of the thousand wild speculations that have gotten into print, do not afford a preparation for the elements of what has been verbally given to me. Its reception into the   mind requires an exalted intellectual condition, at- tended by, and in some sort dependent upon, a purifi- cation of the grosser elements of our nature of soul not less than of body, beyond ordinary human attainment. So subtle are the thoughts, that to convey them in reasonable succession after their reception, requires the same supernatural state. Before me, no one found it possible to write them down. They seem to have fled at the use of any material thing. I have twice attempted it. Once I succeeded; ,but physical ex- haustion was so great at the end of the labor that I could not save my pages from fire which accidentally attacked them. A second time, a sudden access of a malady of the heart, from which I shall finally die, came on in the midst of the task, and it was aban- doned. I shall never undertake it more. I feel that I cannot again undergo the required preliminary train- ing. My ancestors, like myself, were defeated not less by physical failure-at the critical 'moment than by a yielding of intellectual courage and vigor at the overwhelming rush of ideas which came on when a /certain point in the study was attained. "Equally sacred with the study has been the obliga- tion to transmit its pursuit and the presumed con- tinuously inherited mental vigor to sustain it; and to fulfil it the most vigorous exactions of wealth or title in alliances enforced or interrupted throughout all time have been equalled or surpassed; for it was simply to transmit in marriage what I have found more merci- less than either,-the dream of intellectual perfection. I have mastered (y  science that could enable me    <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6869-00000141"/> 280      IN THE RAPIDS. to make my choice. What my wife should be in every mental attribute, in every detail of bodily con- formation, has been so long ascertained and clearly defined that from the mere habit of regarding her image as I had mentally created it, sprang the unre- sisted delusion that she existed, that I had seen, pos- sessed, then lost her. You must know how near you approached my ideal. I am too weak to talk much more, or I could explain why the apparent recognition was mutual. I may say you had been unconsciously  doing what was with me a 'never-forgotten task. I  saw in you but one variation from the image which i for years had for me an existence as actual as my own; and that was a single turn in one line of your features, indicating not the absence but the possible weakness of the main element to which I have alluded -the intellectual courage and vigor to pursue inves.- tigation into and beyond that region where infidelity and its attendant horrors crowd around and repel the seeker of truths, sublime, indeed, but, alas! I now believe, not destined for mortal knowledge. You re- member I questioned your courage. It carried you fat indeed. It failed you at the last moment. Do youi understand, Cora? Do you know why I wronged  you? Oh, my darling, what a fool I have been! To what a dream, unsatisfying, possibly, if realized, did I sacrifice you and myself!" He had spoken rapidly, as though to take advantage of a period of unusual strength. He grasped my hand with a nervous and transient clutch, as if to assist him in withstanding the intense pain which the tightening   IiV THE RAPIDS.      28 I lines of his face showed him to be suffering at the moment. His grasp loosened. His eyes closed and his features relaxed again, and assumed the familiar look that comes so strangely into the face of the dead when the last agony has ceased to contort the ex- pression. I fell impulsively upon my knees to offer a  prayer for his departing soul. The moon passed for  an instant under a thick cloud and plunged the room  into darkness. When it emerged again, his eyes were open, and he was languidly, fixedly regarding me.  "Thank you, my angel," he said, in a faint whisper. "But do not be alarmed. My time has not yet come. Will you not talk now, and let me listen?"  "No, Laurence. I must not. You know my na-  ture. It has not changed. Fancy that I am saying   i what you think I ought to say." We both observed a long silence, gazing into one another's eyes; he with a sad, impenetrable calmness, I trembling with forbidden joy. Commencing by-and-  by in a stronger whisper than before, he said,- "I have- defeated the very object to which I may  say I owe my existence, by the hypercritical judgment ) exercised to accomplish it. I have rushed down from i the dazing heights to which I have mounted in my   I foredoomed pursuit, terrified lest another step upwards i might lose me the guidance of my mind. The mem- ory of a rWife's soothing hand upon my brow at such a moment, or of our children's voiced in my ears, would have lent me courage to go on. "We shall never marry, Cora. Let us seek conso- lation in thinking of the causes which might have 24* I    <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6869-00000142"/> 282      IN TILE RAPID S. made us not happy had we done so. Trained to read men's souls, and having mixed with all classes and stations, I have found few without some secret to make me despise them had I not known myself so well. I am not worse, nor better, perhaps, than the rest. I have done my meed of practical charity, it is true. There is something so tender in my nature that a thoughtless, harsh word, from one whom I have  taken to my heart, has made me weep like a child. I have obtained such control over ordinary human fears as to seek what I ought to know is impossible,-inter-  course with beings of the world to come. I have wan-  dered over battle-fields in the flood-tide of carnage, to  trace out in the mental state of the dying wounded what connection there is between the intellectual and bodily components of man. But, with all this, in a frenzy of rage at a fancied injury, I have, in imagina-  tion, torn with my tiger-hands the injurer to pieces, or  felt his heart open and his blood pour hot upon my  hand under the blow of my avenging knife. I have  candidly weighed myself in the balance against each  of scores of my fellow-men. The trial has not made  me estimate myself below them. But the evil I have found within me transmitted to my children, possibly without the restraining elements of my nature, has been at times 'an overmastering dread. It had its weight in your injury, Cora. Men who have seen me risk my life to save the lives of others, or know that I would not consciously tread upon a worm, have laughed at such scruples. Either they have been blessed with ignorance, or I cursed with knowledge.   IN THE RAPIDS.       283 "Marriage was not designed as a help to pride, or wealth, or any selfish object whatever. It is for the furtherance of the designs of Providence, not yet to be comprehended in their ultimate results; and when we are deaf to the yearnings of nature in its consumma- tion or avoidance, suffering inevitably follows. It is by obeying the laws within us in regard to it, that we recognize how it was in the beginning arranged for the development of our virtues and the suppression of our vices. Self-study has,' perhaps, given an undue im- portance to both, in my case, leaving me without the guide of ordinary men and afraid to be my own. The amount of credit or obloquy attaching to the practice  of the one or the other in the opinion of the world, would be materially altered by a candid confession from the praised and the blamed. It is possible that every virtue, as well as every crime and meanness, waits only for its development in each one of the only crea- tures in regard to whose existence we are taught to believe the Almighty deliberated. "There is but one man, Cora, among all I have encountered, with whom I would willingly exchange natures. Far below me in the esteem which even the least cultivated of mankind accord to intellectual power and attainments, I know of nothing else wherein he is not my superior. You have doubtless read the accounts of the ravages of the recent pestilence, under which I nearly succumbed. The public ear must have sickened of the praise bestowed on me for labors per- formed, partly, it is true, in a feeling of uncalculating charity, but much more at the behests of science, and    <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6869-00000143"/> 284       IN THE RAPIDS. especially in furtherance of my bewitching study,  What is the secret of life?

The desire to solve these questions by pur- suing the manifestations of mind and feeling, under every possible condition of unnatural strength or weakness or disorder, had much more than charity to do with what gained me so much unvalued credit. "But the man I speak of, from pure, manly kind- ness, in a spirit of genuine Christian charity, avoiding notoriety as far as he could, went beyond me in prac- tical relief of the poor, the sick, and the distressed. Such utter self-sacrifice in a man I never saw or heard of. Gold passed from his hands, blessing as it went, and as freely as if it had been the gathered dews of heaven. Stricken down a second time, not by the fever, as was supposed, but by the malady of the heart of which I have spoken, he rescued me even from my coffin by more than brotherly watching, patience, and labor. The secrets of our lives were interchanged. This man was Willis Baxter." "Did he survive the pestilence?"I asked, almost breathless.  "He lives, Cora. I have told you that we shall never marry.

And it is not strange that, having dropped the habit of accounting for their ideas, they should accept. as true any thoughts, however strange, that mingle familiarly with the rest. Even the pride of intellectual strength will sometimes tempt us to think we are above the ordinary laws of nature, and to arrogate the powers of divination. Whether from the truths or the follies which have sprung from my habits of life, I confess I am supersti- tious.

I was indebted to our good-natured, inquisitive, and communicative doctor for the information that, having been disappointed by my mother's death and my ill- ness in the enjoyment of certain festivities which he had planned for the occasion of the marriage, he had hurried away with his boon companions to spend a season in a round of dissipation. Manning wa's soon able to walk out. I could not deny myself the pleasure of his society, and always accompanied him in his rambles, which were mostly along the shore of the bay, the scenery and bracing air of which were very grateful to him. I have can- didly analyzed my thoughts and feelings heretofore in this recital. I can only approach a description of what they were during the continuance of this com- panionship, by saying that every moment of it was one more added to the draughts of which the very first was intoxicating. I cannot say that he ever knew of my marriage. Neither it nor any kindred subject was ever alluded to by either of us. We always ended the day by a walk, extending entirely to the Lookout, if the tide permitted, or as far as we could go towards it if it did not, but always returned before the warmth of the,sun departed from the atmosphere; for his sys- (286)   tern was much reduced, and he could not, at first, stand the cool evening air. It is evident, however, that afterwards he must have fallen into the habit of going out later and alone. Though I always had a great dread of going on the water, I ever enjoyed the majestic play of the waves; and the wild booming of the winds in their career over the vast sweep of water was all music to my ears. One evening, wishing to return to the Lookout after going back with Laurence to the house, and not feel- ing equal to the walk, I took my horse and rode thither. The equinoctial gale had begun. The water had risen rapidly, and in crossing the depression in the peninsula before described, I had to raise my skirt to keep it from draggling in the water. On passing around the Lookout I found that the beach at that side was nearly submerged, leaving but sufficient room for the horse to stand. Remaining -there to look out on the waves, I soon became so absorbed in thought as to forget what was going on around me. The horse, after awhile, became restive, under the continued encroachment of the billows. I had been using some very powerful medicine, taken at first in doses of a few drops, and gradually increased until I had ceased to measure the quantity. I had had recourse to it, and very carelessly, before starting from the house on this occasion. My head became sensibly affected, and the motion of the horse brought on a dizziness, under which I would have fallen had I not stepped from his back on to a bench in the open side of the building, and against which the rising water had closely pressed   <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6869-00000145"/> 288    -   AN THE RAPIDS. him. I sat down, with the hope that my bad feelings would pass off, and much alarmed lest the rapidly rising tide would cut me off from all assistance before I should recover. The wind was now howling furiously around, and the water had already covered the floor. Either the action of the potion increased, or my nerves became weakened under the influence of fear, for my brain began to whirl; and I had only time to cross the floor to the stairs which led to the flat roof of the house, and mount as many of them as my strength permitted, when I fell forward unconscious. Sustaining arms were around me, and soothing words sounding in my ears, when I recovered. Laurence was with me; andnight, of impenetrable darkness, was upon us. "Where are we, Laurence?" "On the roof, Cora. Dismiss all fear. The water  will not rise ,much higher; and we shall be rescued. If it were permitted us to court death ere Providence deigns to send it, I should seek it in the form which threatens us, and now. But we shall be saved." I could see only indistinctly. But I felt that he held me above the water; and I knew by the sounds around us that he stood deep in it. He staggered at times, as well under his burden as before the force of the waves. I doubted if he felt the confidence he would impart to me. I was conscious of a strange satisfac- tion in doubting it. I could only say,- "We must perish, Laurence." And I strove, but uselessly, to pray.   IN THE RAPIDS.       289 No, Cora. Keep a good heart for a few moments. We shall be rescued. Listen." Even while he spoke, I heard approaching voices and the sound of sturdily-handled oars. He hailed the advancing boat, which, guided by his voice, came close up beside us. In another moment we were safe on board. When the shore was reached, I observed that some one sprang out from the bow of the boat and went rapidly away towards the house. Laurence and myself, both much exhausted, gained it after a tedious walk. On the next afternoon we took one of our usual strolls on the beach. On returning, and when near the house, we were both startled by the sound of footsteps among the trees. The sound ceased as we both turned towards it, and was not again heard. Since my recovery, I had always passed my even- ings alone in mother's library, engaged either in read- ing or at needle-work. I repaired thither after leaving Laurence, on this occasion, by way of the gallery, closing and fastening only the inner glass door open- ing upon it. The outer door, or gate at the head of the stairs, which led from without up to the outer end of the gallery, was usually fastened by a self-acting swinging bolt, which shut with a peculiar clang when- ever the door was pushed to. I took my accustomed seat, which was with my back to the wall in a shallow recess between the door and a window on the right of it, so that the light from both fell upon a table before me. I read, or I will say I tried to read, for possibly two hours, during which time lights were 25    <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6869-00000146"/> 290      IN THE RAPIDS. brought in,-but I was too much preoccupied to ob- serve when or by whom. My thoughts were a tangled intertwining of pleasure and pain. I had fears I could not define. There was something contentful in know- ing that Laurencewas living and near me; and there was annoyance in the thought that he must soon go away. I lapsed many times involuntarily into my old agreeable reveries, but always drove them from me on becoming conscious of them. The candles were burning low, warning me that the night was waning, and I was about rising to retire, when I was startled by a violent and sudden closing of the lower gate, leading from mother's garden into the woods. Presently I heard the report of a pistol immediately below me. A moment of silence followed, and then a similar report. Rapid feet as- cended the gallery steps. The door at their head was dashed open. The heavy, hurried tread of men ap- proached me, but ceased midway. I felt the room tremble under a violent weight, thrown for an instant on, and then removed from, the gallery railing. First one and then another person swung off and dropped upon the gravelled walk below. At the same instant a piercing shriek, dying out in a groan of agony, came up from the garden: I recognized the voice of Mr. Brandon! The lower gate then swung open, striking back against the wall with a sound quite familiar to me. Rapid steps again ascended the gallery stairs, and passed in the outer door, which was then driven to. The swinging bar fell into its place. Other rapid but heavier steps came also up, and several quick,   INV 7IE RAPIDS.      291 ponderous blows were given from without to the un- yielding door. In another instant I heard rapid foot- steps approaching me along the gallery, and a man plunged into the room before me, crushing through the glass and. frame-work of the door. He wheeled instantly around, facing the direction from which he came. It was Manning! His mouth stood agape, and he was panting as if to recover his breath, ex- hausted by violent exertion. With glaring eyes he stared out into the darkness towards the outer gallery door, which was still being violently beaten. In his right hand he held a cane-sword, while with his left he shaded his eyes from the lights on the table before me. I attempted to speak to him, but my voice died away in a hoarse whisper. He could not have recog- nized it, for he turned suddenly upon me, and he would have run me through, had not my cry of terror at his threatening attitude stayed his hand. "My God! Cora! I would have killed you! The light blinded me. They tried to kill me. I took you for one of them." The blows on the gate ceased for awhile. "Think you they have gone? Can they break down that gate? If so, I must meet them on the gallery. They may kill you, should they come in here. I hope they may not get in, for I must kill them, and enough has been done already." - Explain, Laurence. Tell me what has happened." "I took a second walk on the beach after leaving you. Night overtook me. As I neared the house,    <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6869-00000147"/> 292      IN 7W1E RAPIDS.  two men rushed upon me out of the woods. I ran in at the lower gate and closed it after me, and thought myself secure, but a man came from behind one of the gallery pillars and fired upon me. I was not struck. He drew a second pistol. I sprang upon him, wrenched it from his hand, and fired it into the air. I felt myself secure against him, without taking his life. But he rushed upon me, and I struck him with my cane. He caught the lower part, leaving the uncovered blade in my hand. Upon this, before I could turn it aside, he rushed, and ran himself through the body." He still kept gazing out into the darkness while he was speaking, for the blows upon the gate had been renewed, and this time with some weighty instrument. He continued,- "Cora, did you hot hear him shriek? It must have pierced him. Did you recognize the voice? Do you know who he was? But look, and tell me if there is blood upon the blade." He held it towards me and the light, as he spoke, his own view being still steadily directed out into the darkness, as if a single instant's lapse of vigilance would be his ruin. "There is blood upon the blade, Laurence!" "Then he is dead! This is the horror for which I was reserved in your behalf. Tell me, for God's sake, Cora, whom I have slain?" Knowing too well who it was, I dared not answer. At this moment the blows on the gate ceased, and Laurence turned towards me with an expression and gesture of relief. But suddenly the sword fell from   "V YNHE RAPIDS.      293 his grasp, and he clasped his hands convulsively over his breast. "Cora! My heart!  I'm dying!" he cried, and fell towards me.

It is of no avail. He sinks, and I sink with him. Who dares to tell me I may not innocently pillow my head upon his breast,-that I may not kiss his ever- more silent lips?

T  HE manuscript terminates with the words which conclude the foregoing chapter. Curious to know more about the second attempt upon Manning's life than is therein set down, I made careful inquiry in the neighborhood. Either from the facts having being entirely confined to the persons engaged in it, or from the lapse of time having obliterated the memory of it, I could gain no information, until, led by my own sus- picions, I consulted the county jailer. I learned from him that on the day preceding the affair he had been called away from his charge, and that his deputy was successfully tampered with by Mr. Brandon to permit the escape of the two sailors, who had been arrested, and were awaiting trial for the first attempt. It is a fair conjecture that they were the persons employed by the wretched contriver and immediate victim of the plot. I know of nothing so suggestive of distressing thoughts as the fate of a man cut off so suddenly in the midst of a wicked life as to have no time for reflection and repentance. It is a relief to me, and it will doubtless be to the reader, to know that Brandon's death was not immediate. The difficulty of becoming reconciled to die, which sustains a bad man, with a feeling somewhat akin to hope, in the last extremity, did not prevent his resort to the consola- (294) .    IN THE RAPIDS.       295 tions of religioni, whose nature and importance were a part, though a woefully unpractised part, of his liberal education. Such as it was, and doubtful as it must ever be, a death-bed repentance closed his unhappy life. I was for a long time so haunted with dissatisfac- tion at the triumphant manner in which poor Cora allowed Mrs. .Victor to retire from her recital, that I have been at great pains to learn her subsequent career. As the sphere of it did not again bring her in contact with any of, the persons herein mentioned, it would be out of place to now detail it. I promise myself the just satisfaction of writing it out in full, as no synopsis of it would do justice to the reader, to herself, or to her victim. If the latter were capable of revenge, and were still living, she might have it to the full. I regret that I cannot follow Mr. Baxter further than the close of the scene of which I am about to repeat the description. No one who views him in the light in which his more particular describer presents him, but must be saddened by the thought of such a dark and terrible shadow being thrown over so fair and beautiful a life. Poetic justice, the sense of which pro- duces or intimates a happy consummation in so many works of fiction, is more frequently satisfied, in my humble judgment, in the most sombre events of real life than is generally admitted. Of the idea which would enable the reader to trace it with me in this in- stance, I will attempt no defence, as it might be insuffi- cient or fail to repay perusal. If the parting scene between Mr. Baxter and Cora    <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6869-00000149"/> 296       IN THE RA PIDS. be remembered, it will be admitted that his admiration of her was so deep-seated as to be ineradicable. Neither the later circumstances recounted by herself, nor the publicity given to them, had other effect upon it than to occasion the renewal of his devotion to her by in- forming him of the removal of the principal obstruc- tions to its ultimate reward. They were married in three years from the death of Manning. After their union, her husband became so sensitive to the real or imaginary social effects of her antecedents, that they took up their residence in Europe. He assumed his mother's maiden name of Clermont. Her father had died in the mean time, and the property at once con- verted into money, added to her husband's means, enabled them to maintain the position in elevated society in which the easy, polished manners of the one and the beauty and grace of the other had readily placed them. It would be worth while to have Cora's own account of their life in these circumstances, accus- tomed as she had already become to analyze her own feelings and to study the characters of persons around her. Denied this, however, and taking what we know of the previous history of each, we can form some very plausible conjectures. Baxter so far lost the admira- ble tact which had previously marked his management of his affairs that his mode of life was not restrained within the limit of prudent expenditure. He'appeared given over to a constant necessity for excitement. This may have arisen from his being haunted with the thought which drove him from his native country, o with dissatisfaction at living out of it. Or it may have   "V THE RAPIDS.       297 been caused by his mind partaking to some extent of the character of his wife's. That this was naturally somewhat morbid is evident. The events of her life vere sufficiently malign to make it decidedly so. Had she married Manning, he would have controlled her. With Baxter the case was different. There is not tlhe slightest reason for doubting the continuance and in- tegrity of his affection; nay, it must have increased. Nor can it be questioned that she amply rewarded him. Though immediately surrounded by examples of fashionable, immoral, and applauded dissipation, their lives, in this regard, were absolutely blameless. They had one child, a boy of extraordinary beauty, which, unfortunately, did not survive the first anni- versary of its birth. This loss afflicted them bitterly, but Cora, in particular, was so much affected by it that she was almost beyond consolation. Her hus- bahd spared nothing in his efforts to dissipate her grief. That I am right in my opinion as to her influ- ence in the change in his mode of life previously in- dicated, appears from the fact that one means of amusement now resorted to, to assist in diverting her, developed a talent in her which must have suggested its own employment. Dramatic entertainments, confined at first to their own dwelling and afterwards extending to those of their more intimate friends, culminated in the extrava- gance of a private theatre, erected jointly by Mr. Bax- ter and a few others. Cora proved the leading spirit, exhibiting extraordinary power of dramatic delinea tion. Her autobiography bears witness to a depth    <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6869-00000150"/> IN THE RAPIDS.      299   298      IN THE RAPIDS.   and range of feeling and an exquisiteness of sensi- bility fitting her for the acting-out of assumed charac- ters. It need not be said that she leaned to the tragic side of the drama. So fascinating became this amuse- ment, that attention to it passed into the business of their lives. While matters were thus progressing, Mr. Baxter was awakened to the knowledge of one unpleas- ant effect of his extravagance, by information of such a consequent derangement of his affairs in America, at the time the only source of his revenue, as necessitated a return to his native country. His wife, though bred within daily sight of so large a body of water as to make the ocean almost familiar to her, had such a a horror of crossing it, that her trip to England nearly resulted in a temporary aberration of mind. In spite of this, she would not, at first, listen to her husband's recrossing it unaccompanied by her. After much persuasion, however, in view of possibly fatal conse- quences to herself, she consented to submit to an absence from him, which he assured her would, as he designed it should, be very brief. She misjudged her own patience in this arrangement. The time elapsing before a letter came from him was passed most un- happily; and, when a letter did come, an allusion made in it to a trifling illness which attended him in the latter days of the voyage, and of which he still complained,' gave her excitable temperament such alarm for his health as, added to her dissatisfaction with his absence, determined' her to immediately follow him. The steamer in which she took passage, after a tedious and stormy voyage, necessitating a ma-   terial alteration in her course, encountered a sunken reef off the coast of Canada. The vessel gradually went to pieces. But most of the passengers were saved by boats and rafts, which landed them at different times and at different points along the shore, as- the yet unsettled weather permitted. A few lives were lost, however. The published news of the disaster, with the list of the passengers, was her husband's first information that Cora was one of the latter. The names of the saved having been carefully collected, her name was found not to be among them. Her distressed husband refused to credit the terrible misfortune, until, having written to England, he was informed that his wife, and not some other woman of the same name, had been on board the ill-fated vessel. He afterwards visited the neigh- borhood of the wreck, and found articles of her cloth- ing in possession of the poor dwellers in the vicinity of the desolate coast. It was remarkable, however, that all the missing bodies had been washed ashore and identified save that of his wife. He blamed him- self for not having gone thither at first, to satisfy himself that a not uncommon error in the matter of identification had not occurred in this instance. How much of doubt remained in his mind as to her death, or how long it affected him, may be judged of by the fact that one of the yet unmarried Helen Paisely's annual visits north renewing his acquaintance with her, she took, if she did not fill, the place of the lost Cora, at the end of two years. He remained in the city but a short time after his second marriage, leading a very secluded life. He then started southward with    <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6869-00000151"/> 300      IN THE RAPIDS. his wife, ostensibly with the design of locating among her friends. Strange to say, however, they never reached this destination, and became lost to the knowl- edge of all of her or his acquaintances. I will give what remains to be told, in the language of the estimable lady who has frequently related it to me, and whom I first had occasion to meet during a professional visit to the city in which Mr. Baxter had, so to speak, shut himself up :- "At the death of my husband, who left me without means, and who had been for some time in Mr. Baxter's employment, the latter gentleman offered me a home in his house. I found abundant means to repay his gen- erosity by the assiduous care required by his delicate wife. He met me in the hall on the occasion of my first going to the house. He had a very troubled look, and, taking me by the hand very cordially, he said,-- "'My poor wife is at this moment suffering from one of her terrible spells. I must impose on your kind- ness to assist me with her. Come into the parlor and throw off your things. As soon as she gets up, all necessary arrangements for your comfort will be immediately attended to. You see,' he continued, as I stood ready to follow him, 'I have been compelled to convert my library-room into a bedroom, for she is so frequently and suddenly taken ill that her comfort has made it necessary.' "Thus speaking, he opened one of the folding doors leading into a room behind the parlors; and I followed him in. My first impression, on casting my eyes towards the bed, was that he was the subject of a most   IN THE RAPIDS.       30I extraordinary delusion. The statue of a dead woman, I should have said at first view, was lying in the bed. Perfectly motionless, the eyes closed, her face a pure marble white, and so beautiful that it looked more like the exalted conception of an artist than a thing actually mortal. The wasted appearance of the fea- tures, which impressed them so strongly with a death- like look, did not detract from their perfect symmetry. Her abundant black hair was the only thing about her which served to dispel the idea first suggested by her appearance. Mr. Baxter commenced chafing one of her hands, applying to it some kind of a dark liquid from a decanter standing on the table beside him, and which he passed to me, requesting me to treat the other hand in like manner. Even at so im- pressive a moment I could not but be struck with the beauty of the hand which I now took in mine. It was delicately formed, even fragile, but nothing that ever came under my notice, before or since, in the work of chisel or pencil, bears any comparison with it. A large, plain gold ring on the wedding-finger was its only ornament, and the weight of this seemed op- pressive when compared with the slenderness-of the finger it encircled. Her husband applied some of the liquor to her temples, and placed a drop or two, by means of a spoon, between her lips. Shortly after this her weighty eyelids rose like curtains from her dark eyes. She looked to neither side for awhile, but stared vacantly upwards. The application of the liquid to her hands and temples and lips was con- tinued. Very gradually a tinge of color, so delicate 26    <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6869-00000152"/> 302    ZIN THE RAPIDS. that nothing but the intense whiteness of her face ren- dered it perceptible, crept into her cheeks, and her eyes began to assume an expression of consciousness and turned towards her husband. He raised and ten- derly kissed the hand he held, and then pressed his lips upon hers. She was yet unable to speak, and, observing me, whom she had never seen before, she gave her husband an inquiring look, to which he re- plied by an assuring gesture. His attention to and concern for her showed great delicacy and patient kindness. When her resuscitation, as I may call it, had reached a certain point, he begged me, in the politest. manner, to retire for awhile, and I left the room. "I was sent for the next morning to the same apartment, and, greatly to my surprise, found the lady sitting up at the window, sewing. What I had been able to see of the interior of the house reflected great credit on the taste of its occupants. But this room, now that it was in order, seemed to me to have been selected for a display of refined judgment in its furni- ture and appointments. The size, style, and colors of the several things in it were selected with such nicety of adaptation that one would be affected, on entering it, with something like the sense of harmony which gives unity to the picture of a capable artist. The occupant was seated in a low sewing rocking-chair, at a window in a recess overlooking a garden at the side of the house. "'Are you not astonished,' she said, as I entered, 'to find me up? These attacks are frightful while they   IN TIE RAPIDS.       303 last; but I recover so rapidly that I wonder I have not lost everybody's sympathy.' "'One can afford to be sick at times, to have such an excellent nurse as Mr. Baxter,' I replied, anxious to show my appreciation of a man from whom my husband had received so many favors. "'Just as you saw him yesterday, he always is when I am sick. If he were not so good a man, I should sometimes think he was tired of-me for these repeated spells. He is always so kind when I am sick.' "She said the last sentence partly to herself, and in a tone from which it was possible to infer that at other times he was not so attentive as she desired. A moment of silence followed, and then she began to talk in a very lively manner. She had been a great reader of works of fiction, and entertained me with synopses of many of them. Such of them as depended mainly for their interest on the inexhaustible topic of love were dwelt upon especially, and my opinions were required by her of how it had, or ought to have, affected the characters under the related circumstances, or under others suggested by herself. It is not a com- mon subject of talkwith happy married women, ac- cording to my experience; and thus entering upon it with me, particularly on so short an acquaintance, in- duced the suspicion that she was dissatisfied with her lot. I attributed it, however, to a faulty disposition in herself, rather than to her husband. When Mr. Baxter returned, he approached her with great tenderness, and inquired minutely about her feelings. His atten-    <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6869-00000153"/> 304       IN, THE RAPIDS. tion' gratified her greatly. I remained in the room long enough to notice that, after the first display of almost exaggerated regard for her, he became silent, and appeared to forget both her presence and mine.. She quickly observed it, and, although an expression of discontent came into her beautiful face, she turned to- wards me and began talking as if he were not present. I was frequently with them afterwards, for periods of greater or less duration, and was witness of many of these fits of sudden taciturnity on his part, and they were invariably uninterrupted by her. He was a scru- pulously polite man, and, independently of his kind- ness to her during the many attacks like the first I witnessed from which she subsequently suffered, his attentions to her, which may be embraced under the term of courtesy, were a remarkable exception in mar- ried life. During some of his seasons of silence,his mind would become suddenly diverted to-her, and then he always made strenuous efforts to please her, and frequently urged her to name something he might do to give her pleasure. She rarely gratified him in this particular, but rather left it to him to invent some- thing, as if he might thereby give a greater proof of the affection of which, as I have intimated, she seemed in doubt. They saw   but little company, and she rarely went out. She was fond of the theatre, how- ever, and would have gone frequently; but this was a point, and the only one, on which he permitted him- self to overrule her desires. He consented but twice to going while I was at the house. I observed nothing on the first occasion worth repeating, except that he   3 53 took no interest whatever in the play. The particulars of the second visit I can never forget. "'Dear,' said his wife to him one evening, as he en- tered the room where we were just about to sit down to tea '(I would like to igo to the theatre to-night.' "' Oh, yes,' he answered; but it struck me he -had, not clearly heard what she said, for he spoke quite abstractedly as if deeply absorbed in something which occupied him when he came in.  He took up a book after tea, and settled himself apparently for the evening. "'Shall I order the carriage, dear?' said his wife. "'What for, Helen? Where are we going?' "'To the play, dear-are we not? Did you not say so?' "'Oh, yes, I believe.' He knit his brow, and a momentary cloud passed over his handsome face. It was gone instantly, however, and he rang for a ser- vant and gave the order himself. "I accompanied them. We arrived late, and found the house crowded. Every seat was announced as taken; and we were about turning away, when a gen- tleman passing in, who knew Mr. Baxter, begged him to use his private bok, as, save himself, it would be otherwise without occupants. It was accepted, evi- dently with reluctance. The obliging owner insisted upon arranging us in the most eligible positions. The box was to the right of the stage. Mr. Baxter sat at the right-hand corner, close to the front. I occupied the corresponding position on the other side,-which would have been my choice, as I like to watch the effect of 26*    <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6869-00000154"/> 306       INV THE RAPIDS.^ the acting upon the audience. Mrs. Baxter was at    L first placed somewhat between us, but a little to the I rear. Either because this arrangement was imposing  too much upon the generosity of the fourth occupant,  1 or from a cause which may be inferred from what fol- lowed, she withdrew in a manner behind her husband, still keeping in good view of the stage, but in a posi- tion not to be distinctly seen therefrom. "The curtain was falling on one act, probably the first, as we entered; and having thus arrived too late to trace the story of the piece, I took but little interest in it, and cannot recall the title. I know, however, that the wrongs of a deserted or some other way injured wife formed the burden of it. The curtain, in due time, rose upon the actress, representing this char- acter sitting at the rear centre of the stage, reading a letter. She rose, and advanced to the footlights, with a slow, niajestic tread, and a peculiar graceful swing, as I may call that motion which, as it is the least under control, gives most of the individuality to the carriage. There was, furthermore, a weighty and re- tarding reluctance of movement which attends mental abstraction in some temperaments, and in this in- stance impressive of a saddening cause of it, entirely in keeping with the character, and indicative of that justness of conception which forever after identifies in the mind, the delineator with the part assumed. "A few-noisy but' half-checked plaudits, a gratified murmur here and there, but, in general, the hush of astonished admiration, welcomed the actress as she stood motionless under the searching glare of the A, w,   IN THE RAPIDS.       307 light thrown upon her from all directions. I never beheld so magnificent a being. Mrs. Baxter's beauty became mere prettiness beside hers. She was above the middle height, and of just so much fulness of figure as rounded every prominent outline. In her face and neck, and in the fall of her polished shoulders, there was barely such a detraction from this fulness as gave the imagination delightful employment ii completing it. Of her face it is difficult to convey a correct idea by describing the features. It was oval in general form. But there was a commixture of the softness generally attending that shape with the firmness arising from the compact roundness of the forehead, the keenly- chiselled lines of the straight nose, and the decisive sweep of the jaw until it approached the chin. In the gentle rounding of the latter, and the childlike curve of her full lips, which stood half apart, there was a be- witching expression of sweetness. You would say, at first, that her face was without color. But a second look would convince you it was there,-so uniform, however, and of so gentle a tinge, that you would question whether it pervaded or was covered by the transparent and marvellously lustrous skin. Had it not been there at all, it would not have been any de- traction from her beauty. Had there been more of it, it would have bereft her, to my view, of her majestic impressiveness. It would have linked her more than I desired with ordinary mortals. I had,at first sight, a strange fancy to consider her a superior being. Her large dark eyes stood, frankly, full open. The light of slumbering fire was in them, subdued by a softness z    <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6869-00000155"/> 308       IN THE RAPIDS.    i  which it was doubtful whether to attribute to her dis- I position or the melancholy belonging naturally to her- M self, or to the part she was assuming. Her glossy   c and abundant dark auburn hair was dressed in the   1 simplest manner, being drawn over her ears and fast- ened in a single roll behind. Ear-rings of a single small pearl each, and a plain gold ring on the wed-  I ding-finger, were all the ornaments she wore. Her dress, a rich silk, was a modest commentary upon the  usual exposing apparel of her profession. "The few plaudits I have mentioned brought a tran- sient melancholy'smile to her lips, not unmixed with a faint trace of disdain. She commenced to speak. Her voice sent a thrill through the entire house. Deep, rich, sonorous,you vibrated under it as one attuned instrument sounds under the note of another. She went on with her part, moving away from the front after the first few sentences, and passing to different parts of the stage in the course of her soliloquy. I was curious to know how Mr. Baxter seemed to like her, and turned towards him. "To say that I was amazed, horrified, by his ap- pearance, conveys but a faint idea of my sensation at beholding him. He was leaning or had fallen for- ward, and clutched the padded frame-work of the boxy before him. The color had left his face, and an ashy i; paleness had taken its place. Sweat was oozing from his forehead. His eyes, with a maniacal stare, were following, as if with a uselessly-resisted, fascination,  every motion of the actress. I dreaded the effect of . his agitation on his wife, and turned towards her.   IN THE RAPIDS        309 Her hands were7 clasping one of his arms, against which her head was resting, and her face was turned lownwards with the nerveless droop usually attending her attacks of illness. I rose impulsively, to offer her assistance. Mr. Baxter caught sight of my movement, and immediately raised his hand with a forbidding gesture, which said, very plainly, 'Keep your seat. Do not look towards me any longer.' At the mo- ment, the actress was approaching us, her eyes bent on the stage, and she saying,- ' - if he were but dead, How calmly could I pray--' "At the last word she was quite close to us, and about to turn, raising her hands and eyes at the same moment with a gesture and expression of supplication. Her look and that of Mr. Baxter met. A slight cry burst from her. Her arms fell, momentarily paralyzed, to her side. She threw her eyes rapidly around over the other inmates of the box, and then detained them a perceptible instant on Mr. Baxter. She reeled for a moment, and then, in two or three heavy steps, plunged towards me, and caught the curtain partly behind which I was sitting. Steadying herself with one hand, she sought, with the other, first her throat and then her head, the top of which she pressed with nervous firm- ness. Her breathing became very rapid, and must have been audible at the other side of the stage. She, apparently, recovered in a little while, and, with the self-control required by her profession, went on with her part. It was evident, however, that she no longer    <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6869-00000156"/> 310       IN THE RAPIDS. correctly repeated it. The other characters in the  play, who had come on the stage at the latter portion of her first speech, looked at each other as their parts came round, and remained awkwardly silent. They all finally passed to the backlof the stage, and the scene changed amidst the confusion. The audience seemed not to have noticed that any one in our box had any connection with the extraordinary emotion of the ac- tress. They were much excited, however, and awaited her reappearance with evident anxiety. Although not comprehending the nature of the trouble, I expected that we would leave the theatre, and have often wondered why we did not. Mrs. Baxter must then have been, as she was subsequently, carried out in  her husband's arms. Possibly his inability to make the effort at the moment may account for his re- maining. "The scene changed again, and the actress reap- peared. This time the fire in her eyes was no longer subdued. She had a wild, almost frantic, expression. ir motions were quick and irregular, and her com- panions, as well as the audience, looked on in moment- ary expectation of some catastrophe. She must have made up much of what she said in the course of her part, for there was little or no connection between it and what the others had to say. It was mostly the language of denunciation, and was fiercer and more vigorous than the text, though less smooth. Her excitement increased every instant. Her eyes flashed fire, and she swung herself, by wild and irregular movements, to and fro on the stage. Finally, the person acting as her   IN THE RAPIDS.        3" brother, and who was standing beside her at the time, near the box opposite to ours, asked her,- "' What would be your revenge?' "She was turned from us at the question, but she instantly wheeled around and strode directly towards us with a questioning cry of- "'Revenge? revenge?' "She swept on so rapidly that I thought she would throw herself into the box. But she stopped suddenly short. Her hair had broken from its fastening and fallen down over her shoulders. Using one hand to hold it back from her face, she held the other out- stretched towards Mr. Baxter, and continued in evi- dently improvised language, the fierce fire of her eyes adding to the words an intensity I cannot convey,- "' Revenge? Her, I'd instant Blast with lighning. And for him! I'd plant Within his recreant heart'undying hell!' "'Ha! ha! ha!' "A laugh, wild, piercing, horrifying, broke from her, and rang out and re-echoed through the house as if a hundred voices repeated it, as she wheeled suddenly away and strode, or rather staggered, back to her 'brother,' seizing his hand with one of hers, and leaning with the other on his shoulder for support. I  X turned instinctively from her to the audience. Some had recoiled in terror; others were leaning eagerly forward under another effect of excitement. Women, with blanched faces, clutched their companions' arms.    <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6869-00000157"/> 312      IN THE RAPIDS.  The majority had risen to their feet, and stood, ob- serving a silence which seemed like that of death, after the cessation of the wild, loud, shrieking laughter ofthe actress. The latter, still panting from her ex- ertions, and scarcely maintaining an erect posture, was gently led by her 'brother' beyond the line of the curtain, arid this was at once rung down. It was unnecessary to announce that the play would not go on. Everybody understood it, and the people began immediately to leave the house. Mr. Baxter had already caught up his wife, and was bearing her out into the lobby. Down through the crowd he hurried; and, as if his strength had come back redoubled, he crushed on irresistibly through the throng, and, I following closely upon him, we quickly reached the open air. On the way to the carriage, which he had directed to be kept at the end of the square, he paused once at a street-lamp to adjust his hold of his insen- sible burden. The lady presented every appearance of death, save that her form was not rigid, and that drops of sweat stood upon her face. This last was an unusual sign. I said,- "'Mrs. Baxter is exceedingly ill.' "'Doubtless,' was her husband's only word of an- swer, in a husky voice. We reached the carriage in  another moment. He hurried me in before him, and then sprang in, saying to the coachman, 'Home with all speed.' Te went spinning along through the echoing streets at such a rate as brought us to the house in an incredibly short time. Mr. Baxter sprang out, his night-key ready in his hand, up the steps,   IN THE RAPIDS:       313 through hall and parlors, and his wife was laid for the last time on that bed on which he had so often brought her out of the very jaws of death. There was no light in the library; but that from the parlor chandelier, by the door being left open, abundantly illuminated the room. The decanter of liquor was produced, and we began, as usual, to chafe her hands and temples.  We were both watching for the sign which permitted the application of a few drops to her lips, when the sound of a carriage, rapidly driven in the direction of the house, struck upon our ears. The husband dropped the wife's hand, and listened. The carriage stopped at the door. A moment of silence, and then the hall-bell rang violently, and instantly after the hall-door was dashed open with a loud bang. In hur- rying in, we had left it unfastened. Mr. Baxter, as if prepared by divination for this extraordinary event, and by a celerity of movement which marked his sensitive organization, had passed me the decanter, had opened the folding-door, and was in the parlors, before I was well aware of what he was doing. He attempted to close the door behind him, but did not quite succeed, as the strong light of the chandeliers was visible to me through the opening. I caught the sound of the rustling of a silk dress passing in at the parlor-door as he disappeared from my sight into that apartment. Rapid footsteps up and down the floor and the rustling of the silk were the only sounds for some moments. These then ceased, and, after a dead silence of immeasurable duration to my excited senses, the voice of the actress whom we had just left at the 27    <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6869-00000158"/> 314      IN TH4E RAPIDS. theatre was heard to exclaim, in a tone that expressed. anguish, exhaustion, and despair,-- "'Oh, Clermont!' "Another period of silence, and then,- "'What does this mean, my husband?' "The closing of the door through which the light had penetrated into the' library, of course left me in darkness, save the little seam of light I have mentioned, with the poor invalid, whose life hung by a most slen- der thread. I was still chafing her hands and temples, but could form no idea with what effect, when these startling words fell upon my ears. They evidently reached her, for a violent shudder instantly passed over her. My-own feelings were horrible beyond descrip- tion. I had no means of procuring a light without leaving her, and that was out of the question. To ring for a servant would undoubtedly occasion an in- terview between the invalid and the actress, and the consequent excitement be instant death. "The actress continued,- "' Why do you turn from me? Are you only angry, or am I forgotten? Speak! Say anything! You cannot know to what this silence, this averting of your face, will drive me. Is it because, fired by the wanton blandishments of that woman, who, doubtless, wants my place in your heart, and indignant that you per- mitted them, I launched such vindictive words on her head and yours, in the exalted impersonation of my part, which you once so highly commended? Think, my husband, of my nature, my sorrows, and my wrongs, and pardon me. Is it because, having learned .   IN THE RAPIDS.       3I 5 your residence, I followed you too quickly to this fair home, which so much resembles that you once so sweetly decked for mee? For God's sake, answer, Clermont! Say anything to drive away the blasting thought that you contemplated this early, yea, or at any time, even if my death were sure, an act so horri- fying that I cannot put it into words.' "The poor creature beside me was endeavoring to speak. I could hear the partly controlled breath pass- ing through her lips in something like a whisper, and I bent my ear to her mouth to listen. I could distin- guish nothing but meaningless sounds. My cheek touched hers. It felt damp and cold, as if a piece of ice had just been removed from it. Her hands, too, were getting cold and cramping up. I was distracted at the thought of the poor woman dying in the. dark, and her husband in the next room. I would have closed the door to shut out any further conversation from her, but I doubted my power to do it without attracting attention. "A groan from Mr. Baxter had followed the last words of the actress. For the first time, he spoke:- "'Before Heaven, Cora, I thought you dead- drowned. Spare me, for a moment, spare me!' "' Not drowned; but, deprived of reason at the ap- proach of death in the shape I have ever dreaded most, I wandered from the rest of the saved. A year ago my reason returned, and I found myself in an asylum. No one knew me, as I had no marlks upon the scant clothing in which I had walked miles from the wreck. Once myself again, I wrote to Eng-    <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6869-00000159"/> 316      , IN THE RAPIDS. land, to your old home, to everybody that I thought ever knew you. 1 could learn nothing. To earn a livelihood, and at the same time have a chance of encountering you, I went upon the stage. I have concealed my name, using the single one of Coradele, as one, including that you once so loved to utter, which might lead you to suspect my identity, and to avoid the risk of offending you by using your honored name as a public player.' "I had been holding my face close to the mouth of -the poor dying woman. Her breath had grown grad- ually fainter, and now ceased altogether. She had passed away gently. Mr. Baxter had now but one wife. I was terrified at being left alone with the dead; and, not daring to open the door leading into the hall, I approached the opening in the other, so as to be able to have a sight of the living persons in the parlors, as much for the purpose of sustaining my courage, as for any other reason I could then or can now give. I was unable to resist the temptation of widening the space, so as to see clearly into the room. Mr. Baxter was leaning on the mantel, full in my view, his back turned towards me, and his face buried in his hands. The actress was again walking up and down, but more slowly than before. She stopped before him, and said,- "'You once, after our marriage, doubted the reality of your happiness. You could not believe that one so far from you-so far above you, you would have it- as I, could be wholly yours. I asked you tp name what I could do to prove it. You answered that there   IN THE RAPID S.       37 was no proof possible beyond what I had already given. I now offer one. In the face of this cruel, un- accountable estrangement, I swear that in my wildest frenzy you were never forgotten; that, since reason returned, your absence, your silence, has torn my heart more than madness did my brain. I bring you my old, unwavering affection. See! I am at your feet. If you will forget me as your wife, think of the mere human being, once more on the verge of mental ruin. You used to be kind, Clermont; will you be cruel only to me? Don't you remember me? I am the mother of your child.' "Tears and sobs interrupted her utterance. I have repeated her words; but I despair of conveying an idea of her piteous, pleading, heart-rending tone. There was a sudden touch of wildness and desperation in the last sentence, which added alarm to the, sympathy for her which brought my own rapid tears. Interrupted by convulsive sobs and fits of violent weeping, she continued,- "'Remember our child, our darling, our precious dead boy!' "At these words the husband turned towards her. She sprang to her feet, awaiting his embrace. He raised his arms as if to receive her, but they fell again, motionless, to his side. His face wore an ashen hue, and an expression as if all the horrors that ever crowded upon a human soul were crushing him down. A vacant glare was in his eyes. The actress first put her hands to her face as if to shut out the sight, and then turned away, pacing rapidly up and down the room. Uncon- 27*    <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6869-00000160"/> 318      IN THE RAPIDS. sciously, I opened the door wider, to follow her move- ments and to catch her expression; for I could not think that, worked up as she was, the scene would end without something more terrible than had yet happened. Her movement brought her alternately up to and away from him. Turning from him the last time, she suddenly stood still, and raised her hands upwards. Her face assumed a look of inexpressibly winning sweetness. Drawing out the words into a peculiar, prolonged, coaxing, irresistibly affecting cry, she said, or, I might say, sang,- "' Baby! Baby!' "With arms upheld and eyes bent upwards, she re- mained motionless and silent for a moment, and then sank upon her knees, while a blanching look of awe came over her face. "'God of mercy!' she cried, rapidly, 'God of mercy! grant me,-oh, grant me my darling, in his angel guise, a little while, to move this father's, hus- band's, hardened heart!' "I do not know how far my excitement caused me to open the door or to expose myself. Certain it is, as her eyes lowered, they looked into the opening, and she instantly sprang up and towards it, flinging the door wide open. A flood of light poured in upon the bed as she stood upon the threshold and fiercely glanced from me to its dead occupant. Three steps brought  her to the bedside. Her husband staggered in after and towards her. She had already bent over and gazed into the face of the corpse, and caught sight of   IN THE RAPIDS.       319 the weighty wedding-ring, and turned, with flashing eyes, on the unhappy man. "' Helen? Married?' she cried, with a piercing, un- earthly shriek, which yet rings in my ears. 'Mar- ried! Ha! ha! ha!' And again the wild laugh of the theatre burst from her. But it was suddenly checked. She began to reel, and carried her hands to her throat and then pressed them upon her temples. Her hus- band, though scarcely able to stand himself, endeav- ored to sustain her by putting his arms around her, saying, in a husky voice, ' Cora! Cora!' "His touch seemed to thrill her with a feeling of in- ! tense aversion. She tore away his hands, and, crying, 'Away! Avaunt! You demon!' she dashed him from her with a force which sent him reeling back into thq parlors. In another moment I heard his staggering footsteps down the hall and out at the open front door. I never saw him after. His wife, turning away from the direction he had gone, and with arms extended as if, to meet some advancing figure, made two or three heavy steps forward, and, crying, 'Save me, Laurence! Laurence!' fell dead upon the floor." THE END.    <pb n="320-321 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6869-00000161"/> POPULAR WORKS PUBLISHED BY J. B. LIPPINCOTT &amp; CO., PHLADELPHA.
