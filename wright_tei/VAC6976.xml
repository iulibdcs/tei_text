PREF ATORIAL. o0   "Ws tell thy tale without a sigh, For thou art Freedom's now and Fame's; One of the few, the immortal names That were not bern to die." -          F. 0. HUX. -cr   NOT only the title of this wor but the brief quotation given above, will at once tell the reader that this tale of too real life, is meant to illustrate the death of the late Revered President Lincoln-the Martyr of the Republic. More, it is meant to give in romance form the history of the dastardly traitors who planned it, and of the cowardly, yet desperate men selected to execute those Furnished with abundant data by one of the keenest and best detectives in the land, who for over four years has watched over tho safety of him who was in- deed our country's hope and pride, the Author hopes to make in this a book, which, while it does just honor to the glorious dead, will also hold up to view nis and our enemies, as they are-fiends rather than men-yes, devils, of whom even Lucifer in hell would scorn to own the leadership-who, while yet aunhumg by the horror-palsied hand of tardy justice, will wander, as Cain did, with a brand burning on their accursed brows which no mortal can efface. Some of the characters have been seen and known by the author; others are drawn as described to him by those who knew them well. With this preface the author commences fearlessly a work which will offend none but the vile and heartless, while it will please all who are good, all who love freedom and our native land-all who detest the base assassin who, with Byron's Cain, can only cry  "Oh thou dead And everlasting witness I!Pose unsinking Blood darkens earth and heaven I what now thou Ur I know not; but if thou seest what I am, I think thou wilt forgive him whom his God Can ne'er forgive-nor his own soul 1" DEDICATING these pages to the mourners and to the AVENGERS, too, of this great shame upon our land, I give it to HE PEOPLE, fresh from an indignant heart and a mind devoted to a Union which must and will be preserved.  &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC6976-00000004"/> XTTT PARRICIDES; * s, Ul-i;J AUTHORS OF A NATION'S GRIEF.   BY NED BUNTLINE.   CHAPTER I. There was a laughing devil in his sneer Which caused emotions both of hate and fear; Aud where his frown of hatred darkly fell, rope, witheringfled, Mercysighed farewell." BYRON'S COSSAIR. Private parlor of a hotel in Balti- within less than a pistol shot of the Noblest monument in that "Monu- mental City," my scene opens. Striding to and fro over the carpeted ' -or was aman, evidently not yet thirty years of age, of medium height, slender, but of compact and sinewy frame-a face pale, even though his wild black eyes were burning with the fire of pas- sion-features of a Roman cast, hair black as jet, floating back from his high white forehead-his whole look that of a bold, desperate, reckless man. Yet, dressed in the most neat and fashionable garb, had he been in a quiet mood, with less of hate and anger in his large black eyes, he would have passed for a gentleman among gentle- men; for there was but his fierce look, his hasty walk, the clenching of his thin white hands, to show how much of the devil was really in him. At last, just as the clock from some neighboring steeple struck in solemn tones the hour of midnight, there was a i.   hasty knock at the parlor door, and to the hurried cry of "(Come in!" uttered by our first character, there en- tered a man also young, also slender and well-formed, dressed too in the height of fashion, but in feature, color of eyes and hair, entirely different. He was a blonde, light-haired, blue-eyed, sharp-featured with a look of keen, foxy-cunning that would at once set the mind of any observant and honorable man against him. "How are you, Booth?" cried the last comer. "You look as mad as if you were looking for a Richmond, the last in the field, instead of me, your true and tried friend!" "I have enough to make an angel mad, Mr. Surrat!' cried the dark-eyed man. "First, the damnable newswhich has this day flashed over every tele- graphic wire in the country-news which bodes death to the power of the South and Southern rights-nextyour delay in keeping an appointment which you knew was of such vast importance to me!" "Wh;n you hear the cause of my de- lay, perhaps you will not regard your disappointment as so serious, Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6976-00000005"/> Booth!" said Surrat, quietly. "Or if you 1 are disposed to bevery angry and wish  to hold me to chivalric account without hearing my defence, why I will send ( down to the ladies' parlor for sister  Anna, who has just arrived withme, and I with her as a mutual second, we can fight it out according to the old code of honor!" "(Ah! your lovely sister here 7" And as he spoke, his eye, before so bright, lost all of its angry fire, and a milder, softer light illuminated it. Yes-we have both just come from Washington, where for the last six hours before I started I was closeted with Floyd, Davis, Mallory, and our new. friend, Orsini! You may well divine the subject of our discussion, for you know well the character and objects of all the men whom I have named!" "Yes!" and a gloomy shadow for a moment crossed the pale face of Booth. "I know some of the men better than you do, andItrustthem less confidingly. Davis is working, not for the glory of the South, but for his own ambitious and avaricious desires. And mark you, Surrat, if ever dark hours come upon the South in the struggle which may ensue, he will take care of hiAself as well as ever Arnold did in the older time. He will prefer gold to honor. As to Floyd, I know that he is now as much bent on fillinghis pocketsprivately, ashe is upon advancing the cause to which you and I are so firmly bound!" "And what of Orsini?" asked Sur- rat, with a quiet smile. i' He is but a tool, one who in the hour of trial may prove of bad material. He comes of a treacherous race!" replied Booth, half-scornful in look and tone. "( What of Mallory? he is the last of the quarAtte which I named!" f He has courage, is self-made, rose fron a pot-house to the U. S. Senate. lHe is a thorough Southerner, but not of tliit pl'roud blood which will carry him   through the struggle as I would like. But had we not better at once go down and see your fair sister? We can dis- cuss matters after I have paid my re- spects to her, for we are both used to late hours, and she is not!" "Early hours, we might say, for it is now fast verging on the end of morn- ing's first hour." "Yes-perhaps we had not better disturb her at all to-night!" "You know, my dear Booth, that she would not retire without seeing you, if but for a moment. She dearly loves the cause to which we are bound-but I fear see loves, better still, one of its truest friends. You can understand me, I hope!" "Yes!"And Booth's answer was in a quiet and almost sad tone. After a moment, he added: "I was not made to love or be loved, Surrat; yet it is my fate to feel for your sister a fove which my heart tells me is returned, and yet it will end in gloom-perhaps in mad- ness for one or the other!" "Poh, my dear friend, this is only one of your old fits of gloom. Throw that shadow from your face and come down with me with a smile there. Anna waits for us impatiently!" "I will try to smile, and would inher presence, were the ice of death upon my heart; butwith a poet whom I only hate because he is a cursed Northman, I can Lay: "There is a smile wihich atoa!s biintliiws i ipuon tho brow of care, A,.d liko the N,'rtli's cold lignt reveals But gathlerug darkness there." ' "There is no use in my trying to talk 1 you out of gloom, I see!" said Surrat. "Anna can only do the work. Spend but a half-hour with her, and then I'll talklwith' you, gloom or no gloom, until daylight on matters which will have sulphureous light, I hope, before long!" "( I am with you?" replied Booth, and f together they left the room.   CHAPTER II. "Her arge blue eyes, fair locks and snowy hands oulshake the saintship of an anchorite." Almost as impatient in her looks, but not half so fierce and angry, had the sister of John Surrat been walking to and fro in the ladies' parlor of the hotel, while her brother was holding the con- ference in Mr. Booth's private parlor, as described in the previous chapter. The parlor had been deserted by the boarders some time before, and she was alone in the brilliantly furnished room. "I am called beautiful by men whose words or even flatteries I despise-I am courted by many who for a smile or a kind word would hasten to my side, or lo my most wilful bidding; yet he for whom I do care with a woman's wild Idolatry, takes my visit to his hotel as ralmly as if I were a stranger! Why cannot my charms move his cold heart?" And she paused before one of the su- perb mirrors, which reached from the eeiling above to the floor beneath her feet, and gazed at her face and figure as if to question the glass whether her beauty was as real as her admirers pro- fessed to say it was. What did she see there? A study which even the matchless Elliott would )nly have been too happy to have ;ransferred to canvass. In form she was rather tall, but so perfect in figure that no fault could be found even by a sculptor, if her height slightly exceeded that of "Canova's Venus-that type of all beauty in the "emale form. Her face, too, was as per- fect in feature as her form in shape. It was of that Grecian style which can be fierce and haughty if its owner wills- or soft and languishing at her pleasure. The blue eyes, large and liquid, were over-arched by eye-brows a shade dark- er than her golden-brown hair, and by long lashes darker still were they veiled when she chose to look down. Her   hair fell in a mass of wavy tresses down over her white neck and shoulders, making her look more young and child- like than she really was; for Anna Surrat was even older than her brother, who had barely passed his twenty-first year. She was very, very beautiful, and well she knew it-knew, too that "Beauty In woman weaves a spell Around poor man's devoted heart, And he must guard the fortress well, Or else he 'll feel its piercing dart." While she was yet regarding her proud and peerless form with a self-ad- miration pardonable in a pretty woman, but basely contemptible in a man, her brother and his friend entered the room. Hearing their voices as they came, she turned, and beneath the brilliant light of the gas-flamed 'chandelier, re- garded them as they advanced, knowing well that in that light no charm of her face or person would be lost. A took, half-chiding, half-mournful, was expressed in her lovely face, and, as Booth hurried forward and, taking her white hand, raised it to his lips, press- ing it there fervently, she said: "My Knight of the Golden Circle seems tardy in paying his devoirs to the lady whose colors he wears!" And she touched lightly the watch- guard worn upon his breast, evidently made from her own beautiful hair. "Sister, blame not Mr. Booth, but me, for the delay which I know has -fretted your always impatient heart. As a Knight of the Golden Circle, I had some information to impart. to him which could not be delayed. His im- patience to see you broke me off before I was half through my imperative duty, and he made me leave a portion of it for a later hour in the morning, while he came to pay his respects. And now, having exonerated him, I will leave you alone a few moments while I see to the arrangement of your room, and  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6976-00000006"/> when I return, you can retire to that slumber which youth and innocence so much enjoys, while we arch-plotters of ruin and. of death to the fees of our cause, consume the rest of the night in conversation of great importance to the dear South which you so much love." And the brother at once left the room, while young Booth and his sister Anna yet stood hand-in-hand in the centre of it, each regarding the other with looks which no true interpeter of love would fail to understand. "Is my justification complete, fair Anna?" asked Booth then, as he gently led her to a seat on a sofa near by. "It is. I own that my impatience not only oversteps the high duties in which your noble Brotherhood is en- gaged, but even the modesty which should distinguish a maiden. But I have one excuse and you know it. Quoting from that Shakespeare in whose plays I first saw and learned like Juliet to love you, my Romeo, I would say  They do not love who do not show their love." Now, noble Knight of mine, I do love and I must show it; how, I hardly know. One thing I cannot bear-neglect. And I fancy if am near, and yet do not see you, that I am neglected. But if I err, oh, teach me better! Let me say with Juliet: "Oh gentle Romeo I If thou dost love, pronounce it faithiflly. Or tf thou thinknet I am too quickly won, I friwn and be p ,rverse and say thee nay So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world 1'f Well-quoted and well-read, fairlove of mine!" said Booth, with a sad smile. "But, Anna, our love is too real to be mixed up with quotations from the stage mockeries which have so often sickened me. I would willingly be your Romeo and die for the love I bear you -but first, first in this too-real life of mine, I fear I have a tragical part to play. A Caesar had his Brutus-there   ; is a Caesar now alive who in me must find an avenging hand -" "I know who and what you mean!" said the fair girl, eargerly. "But I pray you not to risk all that is precious to me on earth, your life, your dear self, by taking in your own hands the dagger which I am told must be used! Men. can be' hired to do anything in this. boasted land of freedom, I am sure!" "Hirelings can never be trusted!" re-- plied Booth, in a calm tone. "The highest bidder always takes them! And treachery would bring a, shameful' death, not on me alone-but on fifty now in our band, and, worse than all, upon your gray-haired father and the brave brother who has just left us!" "Whatever deeds are done,must then be done by you knights alone'" "Yes, dear Anna, for the penalty of treachery with us is too fearful for a traitor to dare enrol himself with us, or. once enrolled, to show or act the treach- ery he may have meditated! That which we feel to be right, those who are soon to be in power, if they live to get it, will pronounce a wrong so dark as to merit death. And mercy will not be an attribute of our foes, nor will we crave it. We must do if we can, and die if we cannot!" "Well, I can only tremble while t pray for your safety and success t Were I other than my father's child, 1 might say more and advise differently;. but were I to breathe one word against the cause he espouses with such fiery- zeal, I believe he would kill me with his own hand!" "Then speak it not, my dear girl! But there comes your brother, and our conference for to-night i nearly over!" "To be renewed again to-morrow, I hope and pray. We dre to return to Prince George to-morrow. Will you not go with us? Father will be so happy to see you! He says that Cedar Grove is always the brighter for your presence, and you know that there are few men,   on earth whom he likes! Will you not promise to come with us? For my sake, do!" "I will go,. dear Ann, if no duty calls me elsewhere. But any call of duty is now paramount to all my own desires!" The entrance of John Surrat now put an end to the loving conference between two of our most noted characters "Well, sister, have you forgiven your recreant knight, or must I again inter- cede for him?" said young Surrat in a gay tone, as he approached the parties. "He is forgiven, but has to do pen- ance by going with us to Cedar Grove to-morrow!" "Most wisely spoken, sweet sister, and I will see the penance carried out or lose a tooth in trying! And now for yourself; your room, No. 99, is ready, and the chambermaid is waiting at the door to see you to it and to aid you as you may order!" "Then I have nothing to do but bid you good-night, and tell you to be good boys while 1 dream of you! "Not goodhnight, but good morning," said Booth, gaily, as he looked at his watch. "Here it is, two o'clock, and in three hours more it will be daylight. Good morning, fair lady; and may you dream of angels, rather than of such fiends as we are!" "Fiends indeed, and I who am so often called an angel by my masculine worshippers, associated with you! You are too complimentary for me to remain any longer in your company! And with a look of simulated anger, her step as haughty as that of any queen who ever trod beneath a crown, she turned and left the room. "Not angry at a joke?" said Booth, somewhat annoyed. "Angry? Why she was never bet- ter pleased than when, with a mock anger in her eye, she hurried away to keep from laughing, to get whla she liadly needs, her 'forty winksof sleep ;'   t for she will hardly have time to take , more. And now, my dear Booth, let us adjourn to your room, where I know' I you have something to take away a f choking sensation which greatly annoys t mealtimes and particularly at present!" "At your service now and ever; move t on with the procession!" said Booth, with a laugh. And move on they did. CHAPTER   II. "Treason and murder are ever kept together, As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose." IN a few moments, Booth and his friend Surrat were in the private parlor where we first saw them in our opening chapter. From behind the folding- doors of a neat side-board, the first- named drew out a couple of bright de- canters filled with liquid of a very ru- bient color, and setting glasses on the side-board, he pointed to the decanters and said: "Take your choice, Surrat-wine or brandy. For myself, when I am hatch- ing deviltry in my mind, even brandy is a weak beverage for me.- But having nothing str, nger to bless myself with, I must go into that!" And suiting the action to the word, he poured out a brimming glass of fourth- proof Otard Dupuy. "I think I can exist and call myself blessed among men with a little of the same beverage under my vest!" said Surrat, following his host's example. "And now, lighting a couple of prime havanas to illuminate our ideas with as we go along, let us resume our topic where we left off, when I went to pay my respects to your fair sister!" said Booth to his companion, producing a box of good cigars to enable the first part of the proposition to be carried out. In a moment more the cigars were alight, and seated on a sofa, the two yoing men renewed their conversa- tiop  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6976-00000007"/> "You were talking, Surrat, of your long interview with our friends in Washington. What was the upshot of it?" "This and no more: That Floyd and Davis 'have got, things ripe and ready for secession, and if that is opposed, then an armed struggle even to the bit- ter end to carry it out. But they hope to carry out a plan which will so weak- en and terrify our foes that no opposi- tion to secession will be made!" "And what is that 1" "The same which you and I have dis- cussed before, and hich has been pro- posed in our Circle. The putting out of our way the newly-elected rail-split- ter from Illinois, and his half-witted compeer from Maine; to use the same wiping-out argument upon some half- dozen or more of the most prominent ad- herents of their party, such as- Seward, Greeley, Hale and Sumner, and then boldly tell them that if they do not after that let us go peaceably, we will sweep them all from the face of the earth, de- vastate their cities and feed our niggers and ourselves from the fat of their lands. The leaders once gone, the commonherd would be terrified and we would Ltiumph without a struggle!" "The plan is good and meets my ap- proval at every point!" said Booth, after a few seconds of deliberation. "But when are the friends of the Ethiopian race to be wiped out?" As soon as matters can be arranged for a general blow at all of them before they can be put on their guard against us. Floyd says that this man Lincoln must never see the White House, much less preside in it. Orsini proposes a rather romantic way of taking care of him. He advises the use of gun powder under the culverts of some of the bridges on the line of the railroad, by which the arch-enemy of our Order comes. Those who are his friends will come on the same train with him, of course, and   all can be blown up or stove to pieces among the wrecked cars!" "That plan is bad and I will have nothing to do with it!" said Booth' quietly but firmly. "People who are innocent of all political error, women and children perhaps, people of both sexes from our sunny and glorious South may beoon board, and I would not in- volve innocent people, while in the act of travelling in peaceful ways in the same fakwhich awaits our avowed ene- mies. No; letthem be met singly or in numbers and met by us boldly with dag- ger or bullet, is my plan! we can so ar- range it, if we work in unison, that not one of the parties marked for death will reach Washington to see the expected inauguration on the Fourth of March next!"            * "Yes,ifall work together. But there is a diversity of opinion. Floyd and Mallory trust a great deal in this Orsini, because he has been engaged in similar work abroad." "Bah! We have only his word for it. He is nothing but a plebian barber, to make the most of him. I believe in ,blood, I tell you. You know I am a bern aristocrat!" "A barber now, it is true, but he says he adopts that profession merely to dis- guise himself and to prevent spies from the old country from getting upon his track. He says he isa Count in his own land!" "I have seen too many of that kind of Counts in this country!" replied Booth, with a sneer. "I was in Nash- ville, Tennessee, only three or four years ago, and there met a French Count who was all the rage in society for a few days, feted and sought after and honor- ed by the best people in the city. But suddenly it was found out that his Countship was of no account whatever. He was recognised by an old steamboat captain as a fugitive Creole barber from New Orleans, who had stolen a large   sum of money from a banker there, and was now sporting extensively op the proceeds. When found out the fellow acknowledged the corn, shelled out all that he had not spent, and pleaded'hard for mercy. He got mercy in a sentence of fifteen years at hard labor in the Baton Rouge Penitentiary, much to the horror of sundry belles of Nashville to whom he had been most agreeably at- tentive. I don't like these Counts with- out they show a clear and undisputed title. Orsini may be somebody, but I doubt it and I think. there is more talk than work in him. Had I been present when he was elected to the K. G. C. there would have been one black ball in the ballot box and more, too, if my in- fluence is worth anything!" "Well, perhaps you are right-he can be watched closely. Davis seems to trust in him." "Let him do so. I told you before that I did not trust even in Davis. He will be the leader or nothing in what is to come. And wohy? Not because he is more fit than fifty whom I can name, but because as the leader he can form and carry out plans for his own safety and to fill his own pockets if all the rest are sacrificed. I tell you Ambition and Avarice are the two strong charac- teristics of that same Jefferson Davis. He can put on the cloak of patriotism, just as he does that of piety. He is re- ligious when it suits his purposes, and can pray fervently in one hour and out- swear the very devil in the next. I know him, sir, I know him!" "Well, we can watch him, too. When does the Circle meet here in Balti- more?'   "Not till the first night of the next new moon without a special meeting is called as usual by signal and personal notice! "Then you surely can go with my siste and myself to Cedar Grove to. day?" "I hIop so. My heart prompts me in that way. But I am to meet certain friends at ten, here, and cannot go until I see them!" "Well then,-as we have but a little of the small hours of morning left, and I feel in a decided somnorific humor, suppose we take a morning blessing and theT try for two or three hours of sleep!" "I am agreed to that if you will ac- cept a snooze in my double-bedded room. I have notified them below to call me before the breakfast hour, so that we will not oversleep ourselvs!" "All right, my dear Booth. I am with you. A slight slug of brandy and a slight chance of dreaming of the future; for life is but a dream after all." "It may be more than a dream to us before we lay it down!" replied Booth, with a sigh. And then the two young men again visited the side-board, took their night- caps, or rather their "morning call," and then retired to the adjoining bed- room to dream perchance of " treason, stratagems and spoils." There we will leave them while we look after another of the villains in our Drama, or rather our Tragedy of real life, regrettiug as we pass on that we have more villains than heroes in our play.   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6976-00000008"/> CHAPTER IV "Wit boots it on the Ueard e to two  Thryugh many a branch the founders of our race, Time-honored c!efs, if, n their right we give  A looe to vice mnd ilukelor vliins live."  IT was morning, the morning of an-  other day iu Baltimore, or rather the 1 morning of that day when we left our  two villains, Booth and Surrat, retiring  to rest in a chamber of the former.  In a large barber. and hair-dressing  saloon, where some dozen, more or less,  of young German tonsorial Artistes were busy with the heads and faces of as  many customers, there was one man, the proprietor, who moved about with an air of dignity quite above the " airs put on" by most of his brethren in that line. He was a full bushel of " persim- mons" above my respected friend Tom-  my Higginson, who, though the proprie- tor of three or four of the choicest sa- loons in the city, and elected Special Barber in Chief to King P. T. Barnum and his aid, Prince John Du Solle is as modest and unassuming as if he was "any other man." That is in show of dignity-not in real worth by any means. This highly dignified Chief of the Bal- timore establishment moved about with the. demeanor of..one who cared little for either his employees or customers, though he received and carefully tilled the money of the latter and kept a keen eye, like my respected friend Sim- eon Draper, on the " rceipts of the cus- toms."      / He rejoiced in th name of Guiseppe Orsini, and though in the gilded signs of his famed establishment he did not prefix his name with the title of Count which he claimed as a perogative of his birth, he nevertheless let it be known to both his employees and customers, and he was more often called Count, than simply Mr. Orsini.   And he was the member of the K. G. C., who had been so freely discussed by Booth and Surrat. Rather under than above the medium height-dark-hued in complexion and fully Italianin feature, with keen, pierc- ing eyes, which seemed to look from their, jetty pupils right through you-- light-framed, nervous and agile, he looked as if he would indeed be the, bravo and assassin which in the Circle and to the lofty men who were employ- ing him, he professed to be. Light-framed as he was he exhibited muscular developments of no mean order. His intellectual faculties did not seem wanting in strength, yet in his thin lip, and narrow-topped forehead, and in the lack of what Fowler, the Great, would call the reverential organs while acqui- sitiveness was full, might be seen a sign of the very treachery of which Booth had mentioned his suspicions. Thus mueh for a description necessa- rily made full, because of the hereafter prominence of the gentleman described. It was about ten of the clock, on the morning in question, that acustomer en- tered the saloon, and took a seat, await- ing his turnfor operations apparently, who also requires a description. He was a tall, elegantly dressed man, though exceedingly Southen inhis style, who wore at least a twenty thousand dollar diamond pin in his frilled shirt- bosom, and a ring of little less value upon the little finger of his left hand. In the golden head of his bamboo cane was set a carbuncle of great size and brilliancy. A chain of exquisite Gene-. van workmanship showed that he wore a watch. If his form was elegant, though of rather herculean proportion, his bronzed face, his rather roman style of feature, set off by a well-trimmed beard, but not marred by a moustache, and especially   hisrmn, well-set I ps amlt :a eye, large, darkly hazel, full and firm, Wee, alike a"rthy of notice. He was in' every way, a man calcu- lated to attract attention and respectful attention, too, wherever he wasseen. Such a customer, visiting his saloon too for the first time, was not one whom even the dignified Cout Orsini could Rtltiely neglect.      *I So;, eyeing him for a moment quietly, he took the morning Amerian, Balti- more's most respectable paper, and ad- vancing to the stranger, said, as he bowed exceedingly low for him: "Will you 'ave de paper Americane, are?  You will 'ave to wait five min- ute before one of my attendent is disen- gage  "' Tdat paper I said the stranger, and a look of ineffable score appeared upon his really handsome face. "Sir, if one afmy Negroes would touch it with his hoe, I'd givenhis body to the buzzards, were he the best hand on my plantation. It dares to support the new dynasty which means to deprive me of my prop- erty and my rights. No, Sir; I am Colonel Armand Melville, of Lonisiana, and I shall get back there as soon as possible, for I will not stay a moment logger than business forces me to in a city which shows so little Southern spirit as to bear a sheet like that in its midst!" These remarks were made in so ioud a tone that every one in the saloon could hear them and in a moment every eye was upon the bold and handsome speaker. And scarce a second passed before a low murmur of applause went through the room. "I sincerely beg your pardon, sare, for de offare of de papare. Your brave sentiments are my own, and nevare again shall dat papare come in my es- tablishment! If, sare, in any way I can appease your angare, I shall do it on my honare."   V'Oh, itisrll' right if y7ff ie6evea inX Southern rights," said thcolonel. "Bat if thereis any mai who dow iot like my aeti;ueuts, you c-n hand him one ofthose eards and tellbhimhe an find me at that'addres!"  - And the colonel took sa dozen cards from a gold covered case and tosed them on the table near by. As by this time a-l "attendant," a Orisini called his men, was disengaged, the colonel submitted to a most elabor- ate shaving, hair dressing and perfum- ing operation, for Which, when it was performed, he tossed down a quarter eagle in gold; and walked off without waiting for the change. He had scarcely gone out when Booth nd his-friend urrat enteredthe place. A seret sign from them induced Orsini at once to precede them into a small back room, elaborately fnismhed, which he called his private office. When they had entered the roomand the door was closed,0rsii said in a low tone: "I would have given de world, gen- tlemens, had you come just five minute soonare. De noblest man, grand as a prince, proud as a king, and wild for Southern rights, so mad because I offer him de Americne, has just left. His diamonds were worth half a hundred thousand dollars! Here is his card." ' Colonel Armand Melville of Louisi- ana!" said Booth glancing at the card. "It seems to me that I have heard o. him. Is he Knight of theG. C. or did you not try him?" 'I did try him with three signs- he did not respond to either, and there- fore cannot belong to us!" "Well, he ought to. If he is a stran- ger here, I'll manage a self introduction and see if he is not a right man to have among us. We need every man of wealth and spirit that we can get." And Booth put the card in his pocket. "Andi now to the business which  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6976-00000009"/> brought us here, Mr., or should a sayl Count Orsinil' said Surat, with a  smile. "Ah, we are all Republican's here,  you know, and titles are worth nothing  with us-not black Republicans Mr.  Booth!" said Orsini, quickening his last words -as he saw an ominious frown gathering on Booth's:face. "I like neither Black or Rea Repub- licans. I detest the name of Repub- lican!" said Booth contemptuously. The face of the Italian, swarthy as . it was, paled almost white with anger, for the party with which he had, professed to be associated in Europe had been known as the Red Republican. But with a strong effort he mastered his passion, and while a sinister gleam of hate, yet shown in his eye, he turned to Surrat and asked him to namethe busi- ness in which he could serve him. "We came to leave wor*with you as the nearest one belonging to the Circle, that Mr. Booth and myself are going down to my father's place in Prince George to spend a few days. Should we be needed, or a special meeting of the Circle be called, tell the K. G( C. where to send for us and we will be ready to respond by putting in a personal ap- pearance immediately!" "I will attend to your wishes, sare- I will attend to them very correct," and Orsini bowed stiffly "Then we will leave, thanking you for your courtesy ". And Surrat bowed and snook hands with Orsini, while Boothturned coldly away without speaking. When he was left alone, the face of Orsini showed how hard had been his struggle to keep in his temper. From a deathly pallor it became pur- pie and he seemed to choke with the passion he kept back. "Curse him!" he muttered, using his own language for several oaths not neededhere. "Curse him! I will behis -1   ruin if it costs me my life. De oath of de Golden Circle is no stronger than de oath of the Red Republican. And de cause of de last is more dear to me dan all of America He is not mymaster- gold is now my master, for I must have it to carry out for Mazzmi, my friend, what he so much desires!" Calmed somewhat with this out-burst, Orsini looked at himself in the glass, arranged his cravat, which he had torn all away in his anger and then went out into his saloon. CHAPTER V-  "On what a tangled web we weave When first we practice to deceive DIRECTLY from the saloon oi Orsini, Colonel Armand Melville moved with a stately step to the very hotel in which our first scene opens. As he passed along, more than one enquiring eye and many an admiring one too, turned to watch hisreceeding footsteps,wondering without doubt who the distinguished looking stranger was. But he passed haughtily on, seeming to care not for aught that was passing around him, and ascending the massive granite steps of the hotel entered the large vestibule which fronted the office. Here a couple of negro servants, black l as ebony itself, sprung forward and stood as if awaiting his orders. They evidently did not belong to the hotel, for they were dressed in a grey livery, trimmed with red, which fitted f their tall and muscular forms with great neatness, and each held his cap, trim- med with gold lace in his hand as he stood there. f"Has any one called to set me, Bob?" asked the colonel of the foremost one. s   No Massa Kunnel, nob dy done ,theen askin' for you!" replied the man s in a respectful tone.   "What have you and Harry been do- ing since I went out-did you remain here as I told you?" "Sartin, Massa Kunnel-we wouldn't dar to do no oder way!" "Well, go up to my room and get out my riding clothes, and you, Harry, go to the nearest livery stable and get the two best saddle horses theyhave. I am going to take a ride through this in- fernal city and see what it looks like!" "Yes, Massa Kunnel. -Shall I tell 'em you use your own saddle?" "To be sure rou black ape--you know I never ride in another!" The, negro was about to hasten away, when the proprietor of the hotel, step- ping from the desk where standing near he had heard the Colonel's orders, said in a very respectful tone: "If the Colonel will permit me to write a note to the keeper of a stable in Calvert Street, he will send a couple of very superior animals belonging to a son of mine who is at Richmond now- the two finest horses in the city!" "Very well, sir-write the note and my man will take it while I go up stairs to dress!" said the Colonel with a haughty and patronising air of a man who felt himself considerably above familiar association with a hotel keeper, and then he turned and strode away to his suite of rooms. Entering his parlor he closed and locked the door behind him and then went into the bed-room beyond where the negro-whom he had called Bob was engaged in setting out a riding suit of fine English velveteen, with heavy rid- ing boots already spurred for service. Four large trunks showed that the Colonel travelled with a rather exten- sive wardrobe. But the manner of the negro was not now so obsequious as it had been when he addressed his master below. Dropping the short velveteen riding coat on the side of the bed, he dropped himself in a chair in a very unceremoni-   ous manner and, as a broad grin spread -over his shining face, he said: "Do I make up well, Wilkins?" "Capital-capital, Barker. You and Young ae- sure of an -engagement at Bryant's whenever you ask it. But I have news for you. I have seen one of the men on our list!" And the tone of the Colonel was now as quiet and pleasant as if he had no haughtiness in his character, "Ah!" said Bob, " which one 1" "Orsini, the pretended Count. I have been shaved at his saloon, and I think I have made a hit there which wi'l get me introduced to some of the members of the Society to which he belongs. That once done, it will be hard if I don't get into it." "Itwillbe a riskybusiness, Wilkins!" said Bob, and he shook his woolly head. "What would be the lie of a Detec- tive if it had no risks!" said the other, quietly. "We three have a big job on hand, one that will pay well and be the making of us, if it is carried through, and it must be. You and Young keep up your parts, and I will do mine, risk or no risk." "All right my covey, as Tingard says when he does up Blueskin. But hadn't youbetterget intothistoggery? They'll hurry up with them horses, for Colonel Melville is already the biggest man in this house?" "I will. Have you been questioned any?" "Yes, first by the landlord, then by his wife, who was dreaafully anxious to know whether you were married or not. Of course you are a single man, the richest too, in all Louisiana. Four plantations, and twenty-five hundred field hands, besides two or three hun- dred more at other work. All of this is known through the whole house before this time, and you'll be lionized to your heart's content." "Yes and more than to my content-  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6976-00000010"/> fo it is the most annoying of the whole part. The only comfort I can enjoy will be when I can get alone with you fellows. Don't the real nigers bother you any "'  "Some oi them tried to- be familiar, but they soon found we would talk to no common thrash or pool-folks' niggers, and they've kept their distance since!" "That is well for they are the only ones Who could penetrate your dis- guise. You look the niggerto the life, but thank heaven, you lack the smell!" A knock at the parlor door interrupt- edthe conversation, and as the Colonel was now dressed, Bob hastened to open it and learned that the horses were readyt CHAPTER VA The oeuruer pawed the round with restleU fee And snorting, foamed and champed the golden bit." DInus. Colonel Armand Melville, arrayed in this faultless riding suit, booted and spurred most cavalierly, descended ;from his rooms, followed by his two -servants, one of whom "Harry" alias Young, also had spurs at his heels, showing that he was expected to ride as a groom behind his master in the morn- ing's excursion. Passing with his usual haughty step over the marble floor of the hotel cor- ridor, he was joined by the proprietor who descended the granite steps to the street, where two of the hotel servants held two magnificent horses by the head. One was a black, broad chested, with a shape which a Sheridan or a Stoneman would at qnce have fallen in love with. His clean -limbs, his small head and ears, his large eyes and nos- trils, his arching neck, all told of "blood" and breeding; making him worthy of the high name the landlord had given him. The other was a bay, ess fiery in look, but yet a horse on   which a cavalryman would wifingly risk life and honor, In short they were as perfect as horse. flesh could be. In glancing at the black you would look first at his fiery eye and noble shape before you glanced at the magnificent saddle and trappings upon him, which as Col. Melville's own, oJ course had to be all that art could make them. "What think you of thpse animals, Colonel?" said the obsequious landlord, while his own eye glanced with pride at the thought that they were owned in his family.  "They look well-decidedly well- something like my own blooded stock at home!' replied the Colonel quietly. The landlord looked disappointed. He had evidently expected his guest to go into raptures over the noble beasts. But it would not suit the dignity of Colonel Melville to go into extacies over anything. Dignity is always quiet. "There are no finer horse's in this state!" said the landlord." "My son has been offered half a fortune for them!" "They look well, I will soon try the mettle of that black-he reminds me of my favorite saddle horse at home!" said the Colonel, seeing that it was nec- essary to somewhat mollify the dissap- pointment of the landlord. At that moment the gentlemen whom we described in the first chapter of this work approachedthe landlord and hand- ing him a card, spoke to him in a low tone. The latter seemed to hesitate a mo- ment and looked at the Colonel wh] had laid his hand on the mane of the black horse and seemed about to mount. But he had with his quick eye noticed the movements just described, and turned away from the horse carelessly, though purposely, and the landlord ad- vanced to him and presenting the card with a low bow, said: "Colonel Melville, Mr. Booth very   .much desires the honor of an introduc- tion to you and if you can delay your ride a moment, I shall be honored by presenting him to you as an old resident of our city, as a man of genius and an accomplished gentleman." Had either Mr. Booth or the secessive landlord seen the quick quick triumph- ant glance which flashed from Melville's eyes as he looked at the card first, and then at the man whose -name it bore, they would have been worse than fools not. to beware of the man who stood before theni. "Another!" he murmured in a low tone too low for their ears. Then instantly with a bland smile lie advanced and extending his hastily un- gloved right hand to Booth, said: "Sir, I am happy to meet one whose name and fame are familiar to me-one I hope too, whose principles upon Southern rights will accord with mine. I am a Southerner, who in feeling a pride in our professional men of talent, do both them and the South justice, for unfortunately at this crisis our men of talent seem either luke-warm or sleep- ing, when they should be up and doing!" "Colonel Melville, while I thank you for your very gracious compliment to myself, let me assure you that I am not one of the luke-warm kind," replied Booth. "I belong to the South and am ready to do and die 'for her. When at another timIe, as I see you are now about to ride, I can have some conver- sation with you, you will learn my true sentiments and I doubt not approve of them." "My dear sir, our conversation need not be delayed!" replied Melville. "I will either' defer my intended ride around the city, or if you will be so kind as to ride with me, offer you the use of this other animal intended to be ridden by the servant who always at- tends me, but yet fit for a king to be- stride!"   I The dark eye of Booth flashed with pleasure as he heard the last offer. Passionately fond of equestrian exer- cise, in which he was an adept, a ride was ever one of his greatest pleasures- but it would be an additional pride to ride by the side of such a distinguished looking man through a city in which one half the population knew him by sight. "Colonel" said he " if you will spare me a moment's time to apologise to a friend in this hotel and to defer a visit which I intended to make to the coun- try, I shall only feel too happy to ride with you." "Mr. Booth, I will wait with pleasure, and as you /have no spurs on I will if you please send my servant to my room for a pair for you, for no true horseman will ride without them!" "A thousand thanks, Colonel!" said Booth, as he turned and hurried away to see his friends, who of course, were John Surrat and his sister. "Harry, follow and see what room that man visits, then get the spurs and 'and return to me!" said Colonel Melville in a tone too low for any one but Harry, alias Young to hear.  Booth was not gone over eight or ten minutes, but before he returned, Harry was back with the spurs, and he simply said " 99" as waiting to place the spurs deferentially upon the heels of that mas- ter's new-found friend. When Booth came, the spurs were placed upon his heels in a moment, and then as the Colonel,had already mounted the spirited black, he was quickly in the saddle of the bay horse. Every eye in the streets was upon them as they rode along at an easy hand gallop, keeping the spirited horses well under the rein, but showing by their grace of seat and carriage that both were perfect in what may well be termed the art of horsemanship. Riding rapidly as they did, they were so closely side by side, that they con-  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6976-00000011"/> THE PAK. versed freely and easily, and that in a tone not audible to any of the hundreds of both sexes whom they were passing on their way. What the nature of their conversation was we can only learn from a future chapter. CHAPTER VI. "A eold-blooded, smooth-faced, placi miscreant." BrWoM. There were three persons in room "99" of the Seccion Hotel, when Mr. Booth hurried up to make his excuses and alter his arrangements, previous to taking his ride with Colonel Melville. One was-always the ladies first-Miss Ann Surrat, the other her brother John, and the third a new character in our drama of real life. Younger than Snr- rat, more foppish in his dress and with an air of dandyism about him which could please nothing but a weak-headed womanpfthat class who prefer dress to heart or brain, any sensible person would at a first glance have set him down as notworth a dozen lines or s thatI take to describe him with. But a second glance at his eye, his firm-set, but thin lips, his quick but not nervous action, would convince the same ob- serverthat there might be something in him after all. Who he was must be made known by the exclamation of Booth as he entered the room. "What Harold, you here? I thought vou were on the watch in Washington!" "I'm only on a flying trip-wanted to see a friend or two here, but shall return to-night!" replied our newchar- tcter. "Yes-we have been in vain trying pursuade him to join us in our visit to Cedar Grove!" said Miss Anna, in her winning tones. "And I have come to say that unless you defer your departure until to-mor- t   it      aiit no.             i row, that I also must relinquish the joy of going to Cedar Grove." "How so!" asked John , ....t in surprise. "Because I have just made ,- ae- qnaintanee of Colonel Melville of whom Orsini spoke. And I find him to be a man whose acquisition to our ranks would be of immense service to the cause, He has just invited me out to ride with him and the chance to sound him on the subject is too good to be lost. Duty before pleasure; is my motto, and you must either wait a day longer or lose my company!" "Then we will wait!" said Anna and her brother joined her in the decis- sion. "As he waits for me now, I must hurry of. If possible when we return I will induce him to spend the evening in our joint company and then you can see if my judgment of character is not good!" And with these words Booth hastened from the room to join the Colonel in his ride. CHAPTER VIII. "A tale more strange ne'er graced the poets art, And ne'er did fiction play'so wild a part." TICKILL. It was midnight, when followed at rc- spectful distance by his 'two servants, Colonel Armand Melville entered his rooms and saw the doors locked behind him. As before, the Colonel went imme- diately to his bedroom where he was Ifollowed by his splendidly disguised as- sistants, who now safe from outside ob- servation at once threw off their servil- ity of manner and spoke to him on terms of perfect equality, for they were to a certain extent equals, different as were the parts which they played. "You've something rich for us to- night Wilkins-I know that by the   glance of your eye and your cold; ,triumphant smile!" said the one known as "Harry" when a servant, but in his true character as Young. "I have indeed!" said the Colonel. "Then let us have it quickly, for I'm blessed if this playing nigger isn't the worst phase of life that I have ever tried!" said Barker, alias "Bob." "Well boys, keep easy and you shall hear my story-but first I must light my 'cigar!" The Colonel lighted his cigar as did his two companions theirs, and, then he related his tale in these words. "The best of fortune has attended us all day. When I went to the shop of that fellow Orsini, I knew that it was a kind of Head Quarters for these Knights of the Golden Circle, and conducted myself accordingly. And I hit a vein a great deal sooner than I expected. It appears that I had but just left there when two of the head men on our list, John Wilkes Booth, with whom I rode out this afternoon and his confederate, JohnSSurrat, called there. Orsini gave a ,description of me and the way I talked This struck Booth particularly, for he in spite of some romance and a good deal of the devil in his nature, knows and means business in the plot that we know him to be engaged in. "Booth took one of my cards, came right around to the hotel and asked old  Pharnum the landlord for an introduc- tion. I knew him in a moment and wavs never so glad in my life as I was, when he fell into my trap. As you know, I invited him to ride with me ald in that ride I discovered what is a ortune to us or I'll lose a hat."  "Let's hear it, I never knew you to  talk so slow as you do to-night Wil-  kius!" cried Barker. "No wonder at that,. for I'm tongue weary I've had him to talk to all the  'fternoon, and spent the evening with a party of his friends, and one of them a woman with a thousand and one ques- a   tionsto ask, all of which on account of her sex, if nothing more, I was bound to answer. "But I'll go ahead with my story and reveal my discovery. From Booth I learned positively that the  Golden Circle has a band here, another in Washington, and a third in New York City. And now I shall learn all their secrets and who belongs to them as well as their plans of evil, for Booth is to propose me as a member immediately and without a doubt before another night I shall be one of them." "aisky, awful risky,Wilkins!" said Young. "I knoiwt," replied Wilkins, "but it is a risk that will pay, and I'll go through with it or die in the trial. Booth told me more of their movements 'than I ever dreamed of, much less knew, before, and I shall, or rather we will profit by it. He seemed to become per- fectly infatuated with me and my ultra Southern principles. He told all that he dared to tell before I have joined their order." A"What did you find in No. 99, to keep you up so late?" asked Barker. "Three more of the conspirators, and one of them a handsome woman, as sharp as a steel-trap!" replied Wilkins. "I spent the whole evening in not only deciphering their character and plans, but in also making my- self so agreeable to all as to be able to re. ceive an invitation which will carry me to another of their gathering places. I can tell you what it is, boys, w vehav bigjob to work up-one which may involve the safety of the nation-and since we have commenced upon it, we must carry it through. You must hold out with me, though sometimes the duty will be unpleasant. You know I take the most dangerous part upon my- self!" "Yes," said Young, " that is always your way. But you will get the most credit when we are through." "Never mind the credit, when the profits are equal!" said Wilkins, with a lalgh.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6976-00000012"/> "I will, however, be the first to say that w without such support as you have given and o continue to give me I never could have suc- h ceeded. And now let us take a morning c blessing and go to bed, for I am about beat s up!" And a big black bottle was brought up h from the depths of one of the huge trunks, a and passed from mouth to mouth with I familiarity that would have rather astonished the new friends of Colonel Armand Melville, a had they seen it.  CHAPTER IX.  ", Here the architect Did not with curious skill a pile erect Of carved marble touch, or porphyry, But built a house for hospitality." In the wildest part of that yet wild, though ancient county of Maryland, known as Prince George, stands amid an immense grove of cedars, a dwelling capacious in size, but of that plain and unpretending style, marked only for its convenience, in which most of the buildings of the earliest settlers of Virginia and Maryland were erected. Through those States hundreds of such buildings yet exist, built long before the revolution of 1776, and some of them during this last home revolution, the author of this work has seen demolished by shot t and shell, when turn, z o the base use of forming defences for rebel sharp-shooters, or for headquarters to the murderous guer illa gangs who made them a place ofrefuge by day, and crept from them at night to fire upon our pickets or on some passing column, or some courier whose despatches were needed in the rebel camps. The building was large-full seventy feet in length by for forty in depth-in heighth two stories, a piazza running all along the front. At either end rose a huge brick chimney, projecting out from the house, the foundations being as low or lower than those of the main wall. The window-shutters, and every window had them, were not of our modern Venetian style, but of solid and thick plank. The doors were wide and lofty, but they too   were solidsand plain. There was nothing of ornament or architectural taste about the house or its surroundings, but it looked as if comfort could be had inside of its firm, sub- stantial walls. I In different parts of the grove near to the house could be seen some barns and stables, and a cluster of the neat cabins generally known in "Dixie" as " negro quarters." The appearance of animals, carts, ploughs, and other agricultural implements around the barns betokened that this was a planta- tion house, though from the scarcity of ( wooly-heads" about the quarters, it did not seem to have a large working force. A good deal of time spent, some of my readers will say in a lame description of an old house. Not lost, my dear reader, for I describe to you, with the precision of truth, the dwelling in which dwelt a part of the plotters of tho murder, and in which was' harbored the chief of the vile gang who have deprived our nation of her hope and glory-the man who crushed slavery and conquered peace, and died a martyr when his great work was at an end, by the hand f of a man whose name is now as immortal in infamy as that of Cain, the first murderer, or Judas Iscariot, the chief of betrayers. r  And now  to work again in the old track. On the third afternoon succeeding the day when Colonel Armand Melville took r- equestrian exercise with John Wilkesi e Booth, quite late, for the sun was slant- ie ing low over the tops to the cedars toi , the West. on the piazza of this build- re ing sat three persons. One was a lady not yet out of life's et prime-for she did not look to be over th forty, that age when King George the he Fourth of England   declared woman ek most enticing, if she were also fat and he fair. an  The next was a gentleman, probably ten or fifteen years her senior-a plain )w planter-like looking man, with nothing an very striking in his appearance. he  The third was a low-browed, dark too complexioned man, decently dressed   but with vilain stamped upon every feature of his face, every line of his countenance. A man whom you would at once- stamp as a nature-marired scoundrel. "If they come to-day, Mary, it is time they were here, for the boat lands at three and I told Sam to drive fast after he got them in the carriage!" said the elder gentleman, addressing the lady. i  Sam may have more to carry in the carriage than our John and Ann. Both of them are fond of bringing company home with them and may do so to-day!" replied the lady. "Yes a devilish sight too fond of it, for our safety in the business we'er en- gaged in!" said the repulsive looking man, in a hoarse, guttural tone. "The less company that comes around while I'm here, the better I'm pleased!" "Mr. Atzerot, when my son or daugh- ter bring company here, they know who to bring, and I am sure it is no bnsiness of yours!" said the lady, and her dark grey eyes flashed angrily upon him. "I suppose not!" growled the man whom she called Atzerot and then he muttered to himself in German which sounded very like swearing. "They're young people, Atzerot and like company. While they are judici- ous in the selection of their company, we must not debar them from all pleas- ure!" said the gentleman. "I don't want to do thatSurrat!" said the other, still speaking in his surly and ungracious tone. "But we're doing a heavy job, risking our necks every mo- mnent and curse me if I want mine stretched if I can help it. You have some money, enough to live decently on. I have'nt and I want to earn enough by this job to carry me to the old country and enable me to live there like a lord, as my father did before me. For that I don't want to see the job )poiled by any carlessness or folly!" "There they are now!" criel thie lady   and the look of anger anddisgust which had just darened her rather handsome face, gave way to an expression of joy which brightened it immensely. And as she spoke she pointed to a broad avenue between the cedars to the northward, where a carriage was seen coming at a slow rate toward the house, followed by an open wagon in which several persons were riding. "Yes and with more company! curse the luck-I shall make myself scarce till I know who they are!" said Atzerot, and rising from the chair in which he had been sitting, and smoking his mer- schaum, he hurried into the house. "Husband I cannot bear that Dutch boor!" said the lady, as Atzerot passed from sight. "Mary he is in the party engaged by those who employ us, and we must bear with him for a time, but I know he is a pest to you and I hope soon to get him changed to other quarters. It is literally on compulsion that I keep him here. I wonder who John has, brought with him' Tried friends, I hope, for I too am distrustful of al strangers." "We will soon see!" replied the lady "I have all faith in John's dis- creation. Anna also is a girl of rare sense and judgement and not one who will let her heart run away with her hand, as is the case with too many girls of her age!" While the lady was yet speaking, the lumbering, old fashioned family coach reached the grassy lawn in front of the house and Mr. and Mrs. Surrat walked out from the piazza to meet their son and daughter and such friends as they might have brought with them. "Ah, Mr. Booth, I anm so glad that you have come!" was the exclall;tion of Mrs. Surrat, as the first geltl(-la stepped from the varriage. And she took his exteiinlld hnud alnd shocdl it warmly.

"Mother," said Anna, who still held the hand of this, noble-looking man, "permit me to present to you Colonel Armand Melville, a Knight of the Gold- en Circle, and also to you dear father, as our guest for a few days!" "He is mostwelcometoCedar Grove!" said Mr. and Mrs. Surrat, bowing to their distinguished looking guest. "And I am most happy to meet a welcome in such a romantic scene as this. Mr. Surrat you have the finest place that I have yet seen in Mary- land!" said the Colonel. "It was once among the finest, sir!" replied the planter. "But it has run down and everything needs repair. If brighter days come it may look as it, once did!" "They willcome sir-theywillcome!" said Melville, as the party proceeded to the house. "Things look dark just now, but bold hearts and firm hands can break through the clouds. You under- stand me!" "I presume I do, and we will talk of it while you are with us, for in truth we think of nothing else here," replied Mr. Surrat as he led the way into th3 house. The first room which they entered was a large old fashioned sitting room at the eastern end of the house, with space enough in it to accommodate a hundred persons. Although it was in the fall and not yet cold, a cheerful fire blazed in the huge fire place-not a wintry fire, but one all sufficient to dis- pel the damps and chills of an autumnal evening. The furniture was plain, but massive and of the style used an hun- dred years ago. A side-board, with its shelves and cup-boards open to view occupied a prominent position on on side, and to it the old planter at once led his guests.    % ," Gentlemen," said he, it is a rule a   Cedar Grove to wet our welcome in a glass of any liquor which the guest may choose-here you will find Jain L a that has been on the place fifty yeara-old peach brandy of our own make, with honey to mellow its fire-Apple Jack, old Rye, or wines if youindulge in such weak beverages at other than meal times. Help yourselves!" And the planter pointed to a row of shining decanters and quaint looking bottles, each labelled with its contents, and to goblets of the same old fashion- ed style as everything else in the house. The gentlemen were none of them backward in obeying the direction to- help themselves. Colonel Melville took some peach and honey, pronoun- cing ita drink fit for a Prince. Booth took some old French Brandy, and Sur- rat more of 'a native, went in for the "Apple Jack." As soon as the Colonel had tossed off his peach and honey he excused him- selfla moment, saying he wished to see if his niggers had gothis baggage out of the wagon and went out where "Bob " and "Harry" who had come in a wagon. in the rear of the coach were unloading. twoof his heavy trunks-the resthaving been left in Baltimore where he still kept his rooms secured at the Secession. hotel. *"Look sharp here boys," he said in a. low tone-" we are in the worst nest of the whole gang. Keep eyes and ears. open and hands ready!" Thenin a loud and authoritive tone he cried: "What the devil are you so slow t about you infernal black apes! I want them trunks out, for I must have these s dusty clothes off me in ten minutes or I'll be the death of you!" e  "I will show them at once where to o carry your trunks, Colonel," said John Surrat, who had followed him out. "Ous t accommodations are not the most ele   gant, but you must feel that we do our best to make you feel at home!" "No apologies, mydear Surrat " said the Colonel blandly. "I feel that I shall fare sumptuously. Your father is a noblespecimen of the Southern gentle- man, a thing too scarce now-a-days. You must come down to Melville Hall in Louisiana one of these days and I'll try to reciprocate your kindness. What a noble looking woman your mother is too, but so welt preserved that had you not called her mother, I should have said she was but an elder sister!" ' You are flattering in your remarks, Colonel!" said young Surrat, delighted, as he led the way to the room selected for the Colonel, followed by Bob and Harry with the trunks. "Truth is never a flatterer!" said Melville, and they entered the chamber selected for him. It was on the second floor with large windows Opening out upon the extensive garden in the rear of  the house and in summer must have i been the most pleasant room in the  house, for vin .s not flowering were j trained up to the very roof-the Cedar e Grove and a glimpse of a small, but 1 pretty lake in its shady depths was the X next attraction. Furnished more ele- N gantly and with more of modern taste than the rooms below, the Colonel saw 1 that he was considered the most honor- i ed guest of the house. "Can my servants have a mattrass at the c door of my room 7-I am in the habit of T always having them near me!" said the S Colonel, as he glanced with an air of satis-  faction around the room.  "Better than that, Colonel. There is a a room next to this, to which they shall be as- V signed. They are the best behaved niggers I ever saw!" replied Surrat.    I "I keep them disciplined sir-I keep " them disciplined There is nothing like t   discipline for a nigger-it keeps him straight. and makes him respect you and like you too! And now, friend Surrat, as soon as I have changed these dusty travelling clothes for something a little 'more genteel I will join you and our friend below!" "Do, Colonel. Dinner will be ready in less than an hour, and I know our long journey has given you an appetite! replied Surrat, and he left the room. The Oolonel was now alone with his servants, or as we. know them, his friends. While he was dressing in his most " killing style," he was employed in giving them minute directions in regard to their action while there. "I learned," said he, "after my teraible initiation into the Order of the Knights of the Golden Circle, that there was a female branch of that organization, sworn by oaths as terrible as those which I, once entered upon the track, had to take. The head of that Female Department for Maryland and Virginia is that gray-eyed, good-looking wVman, who, with her husband, welcomed me to the house. You must be wary, for in Mary E. Surrat-that is her 'name- we have intellect, daring and cunning to deal with. Let her suspicions be once aroused by any of us and the game is up, and it is not likely that we would get off easy. I was told of another man, a desperado named Atzerot by Orsini. He said he was down here. He belongs to the band, but is held in pay, and is to use the dagger or pistol whenever called for. I have a description of him, but he does not show himself, and may not be here. Keep a lookout for him. Swarthy, dark-eyed, thick set, low browed he is a man you'll mark at a glance, if you see him. Mingle carefully with the house servants, and find out, without asking, all who visit here. You know how, boys." By this time the Colonel was dressed in his most elegant style, and leaving his "boys" to attend to his trunks, he descended to join the family.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6976-00000014"/> OHAPTIR  X. Alihuman bito try Att u ' Tt kappine for man, the hungry sinnw, ol at  ve a"teppil", mll t depend en dinr. ta The cold gray eye of Mrs. Surrat was for a moment brightened with a gleam of ad-  miration, as Melville, so finely formed and so t elegantly and unexceptionably dressed, en-  tered the family sitting-room where all of t the family, with Boothl in company, were now assembled. -LongWas it usually takes ladies to make their toltte--according to hearsay evidel .t for personally of such  matters I am a; "Knownothing'-Miss Annie had completed, hers in less time than had been occupied by the Colonel, for when he  entered the room he found her already there,  fresh as a just opened rose, dressed in a neat and tasty dinner costume. Booth, careless n as ever, had made no change in his apparel, fi neither had John Surrat, who probably felt too much at home to think it necessary to stand uponthe ceremony of dressing for din-  ner. Mr. Surrat, who by the way seemed to possess far less force of character than his i wite, and to be nothing more than a gentle- manly planter who wanted to get through  the world comfortably and easily, rose as Melville entered the room, and said: "Colonel, our table waits, if you are ready to dine. You must pardon our plain coun- try fare. We give the best we have at hand, for we had no notice of guests being on thei way ." "My dear sir, you seem to forget that I am a planter myself, and know well how to live as planters do. The appetite which eight hours of travel gives me will make your table, whatever it contains, seem like an epicurean's dream to me!" replied Melvile. '"Then to dinner all!" said the planter, and singly he led the way toward the dining room. Melville determined to loose no opportu- nity of making his mark in the right place, offered his arm to Mrs. Strrat, and Booth followed with Anna, while John brought up the rear, as his father had led off in single tnC.   phLv &amp;e u.                1 Upon entering the dining room, a long and ancient looking hall, furnished in the same old fashioned style as the sitting room, a  table was seen at which no sane man not af- flicted with the dyspepsia would havegrum- bled, A tureen of turtle soup was steaming at its head, and relieves were seen upon the table which presently shall be described, so that our Northern readers may know how  Southern planters lived before the war- how they live now is a far different matter. As soon as they were all seated-Me!ville of course on the right hand of his host and next to the lady whom he had escorted to the table, Mr. Surrat in old Southern style, filled the plates with soup, which the serv- ants at once handed round. "Where do you get turtle here, Mr. Sur- ratt?" asked Melville--" this soup is very fine!  t  "We get them  from the Chesapeake, wh'ere we get the' delicious fish, sheepshead, which will follow your soup," replied Mr. Surratt. "Our rivers and our bays and o our forests yet abound in game, for long as i this country has been settled, it has not  been so crowded as to drive out the first h settlers of all!" The soup and fish attended to, the solids of the table appeared, and it seemed as if ly Mr. Surratt must have spoken in mockery n when he apologized for the poorness of his d, table. ir My friend Commodore Jones would have gone into raptures over that bill of fare and I he knows what is whtt in all that concerns to the inner man. ch  Venison, beef, fowls, fowls both wile and ke tame, from the peerless canvass-back, to the an plump and tender Dominica-all cooked in  various ways, and last -but not least the nd baked oppossum, followed the first courses. ig  The confectionary was not of the poorest kind-fruits and preserves of the rarest tu- species closed up the repast, while some hall ce, dozen varieties of wine made those cheerful oth who enjoyed the various delicacies of the up sumptuous table. gle  It was not eaten in haste, pleasant dunver sation kept the appetite from falling and   t s '-"r* vpvon the table long before even  ^e second course was over. fter dinner coffee was served at the  table, and then by common consent there  was a general adjournment to the parlor where stood a grand piano, upon which Miss Anna played some pieces superbly. At the request of Colonel Melville who professed not to be a musician, though pas- sionately fond of music, she sung several of the most fashionable airs and some choice selections from popular operas, for she had made music a specialty in her education and and was possessed of genius as well as skill in the arts of all arts. "Music I oh, how faint, how weak, Language fades before thy spell! Why should feeling ever speak, When thou cana't breathe her words so well t Friendships balmy words may pain, Love's are e'e5 more false than they- Oh I 'tis only music's strain Can sweetly soothe, and not betray I' Though Colonel Melville professed not to be a musician, the knowledge he evinced of the art, his appreciation of the finer points of the pieces which the daughter sung and played, showed that he was far from being ignorant of the principles of the divine art. And thus passed the first evening at Cedar Grove, for it was almost midnight when the family and guests retired. When Melville reached his room   he found his faithmul servant "Bob"-or Barker, waiting apparently to attend upon him, but really to compare notes as usual Harry was elsewhere on another scent. As soon as he had closed his door and turned his lamp down so dimly that noth- ing could be seen from  outside in the darkened room, he asked of Bob in a low tone, almost a whisper: "* Anything new my boy?" "Not sure!" replied the other. "Have you observed anything?" "Yes, an empty plate and seat at the table, where some one has been used tc sitting, or where some one was expected that did not come  I dared not ask a question there for fear of exciting suspic ion 1" "We have it, I reckon 1" said Barker   quietly. "Young is of on the track of a fellow who lurked around, got atoul of us and asked us a lot of qnsetion--a regular haid-looking case, whom we think to be that Atzerot that you warned us about. He seemed mighty uneasy about somebody, and while you were at dinner he went off and Young started in sight of him. He'll not lose Wis track if you should happen to lose a fifteen-hundred dollar nigger. If he is not back by daylight, Young told me to say you'd find him in Biltimore, and to keep matters ship-shape, you'd better make a fuss about his running away, advertise him and all that."' "Good.  Young is keen. There are none brighter in the profession. Did this fellow talk like a half drunken Inhian- thick and gutheral and look like a cross between a Malay and a Dutchman V" "He looked about so, and talked about 8o!" "Then he is the man-I am glad that Young has followed him. He is like Or- sini an assassin by trade, but more dan- gerous, for he is more brutal." "What do you make out of these Bur- rats?" "That the old lady is a devil incarnate. Her husband is not much, and if he stands in her way at all his life is not worth the candle that lights him to bed. - The son is smart, bitter and deep in the plot, but too confiding to be dangerous. I have every secret of his breast already!" I "And the sister-what is her part?" "Only that of a syren to draw on stran- 3 gers until they are felt of, and scrutinized runtil they are known. If found worth any- thing to them, it is then as easy as they did with me to lead the strangers on until they are within the "Golden Circle." She is coquettish, but not dangerous, for she is too much in love with Booth to look be- ) yond him in anything!" "And what of Booth? Can you read a into him any more?" , Yes-he is dangerous. He is cool cal- culating, and has physical courage. He is r, a good plotter and will act whenever he  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6976-00000015"/> has the ch e. He will prove as bad as any of them and must be one of the first that we cheek-make But it is late and I suppose if we're to be anybody to-morrow we had better be taking some rest." "That is so, and I'll be off to my little room. Hallo-what's tht?" The last, exclamation was caused by a light tapping against one of the rear win- dows of the room. Melville instantly stepped forward, and though it was quite dark outside, recog- nizvd the oetlines of a human form, which seemed clinging to the trellice work which had been used for supporting vines. Raising the-sash with one hand while he held a revolver in the other, he asked quick- ly, but in a low tone: "Who is there? Speak quick, before you get a bullet through you!" "Don't be in a hurry about the bullet, hut lend -mne a hand to get into the window 1" said the man, in an equally low tone. "This frame work is confounded weak, and I'll have considerable of a trouble if it gives way!" "Thunder and lightning! It is Young!" said Barker, who stood close by Wilkins. "So it is. Lend him a hand!" And Wilkins and his companion reached out, and getting Young by the arms, soon had the other detective in the room beside them. "Well, what news?" asked Wilkins, as he grasped Young by the hand. "The news is, sir, that I've traced out that  Atzerot. He is frightened at something, for : though he lives here, and has been living here for the past two weeks, he went away  to-night, and walked six miles to a small vil- 1 lage called Surratville, and has engaged 1 board at a one-horse tavern there!"  "Engaged board? Then he goes no fur- ther away at present!"  "No; it appears by that that he does not 1 mean to!"               a "Well, he is where we can watch him easily. You look as if yon had had a hard  tramp!"  "You'd better believe I had. The fellow t went fast,and I knew that I must keep up, a   a or lose his trail. I've travelled after some b ifast walkers, but he beats the crowd. I must 1 touch Uncle Jake, or I shall faint. If I don't, r it's a wonder1!" And Young's hand went down into the e nearest trunk after the black bottle before describod, from which he extracted an im- I mediate blessing. Then the two gentlemen from the dark side of Cork retired, leaving the Colonel to en- i joy his rest. CHAPTER XI. "Oh for a tongue to curse the slave Whose treason, like a deadly blight, Come's o'er the councils of the brave, To blast them in their hour of might." Moon. "Yes sir, by all that is bright above or dark below, I mean that no repub- lican President shall ever rule over me! I swore it before the election, I avowed it during the canvass, and here, here in sight of the White House which the devilish abolitionists would put him into, 1 renew the oath i" The man who uttered these words, was a thin-faced, sparely formed per- son whose hair, of a silver grey, be- tokened coming age. His carriage was erect, his air nervous, but imperious- his steps rapid, his appearance, despite his civic dress, that of a military man. His companion was stouter in orm, redder in face, and more dressy, also younger by several years. The two were walking up Pennsyl- vania avenue toward the Treasury buildings, with steps that betokened them to be on business rather than pleasure. "Mr. Davis, I feel as much as you do on this subject. But the evil is upon us, and I do not see now how we can avoid it!" "Easily, Mr. Mallory-easily. South Carolina is even now in open revolt. Floyd told me of news that he got from there this morning which shows that the state is wholly for Secession. Virginia   -tands ready, Kentucky and Tennessee will not be far behind." "But if this new President should turn out to be a thorough business man, and like Andrew Jackson tell us 'by the eternal' it shall not be-what then?" "Stephen R. Mallory, this new Presi- dent, as you call him, will never live to enter upon the duties of his office. You are not vet initiated, or I could show you good reasons why. His days are numbered, sir-numbered, I say!" "Perhaps, Mr. Davis-perhaBps! But thebest laid plans sometimes will mis- caJry!" "One plan of ours cannot miscarry! Ah, there is a man coming out of Wil- lard's whom I must see." And the plotter of treason called out to a young man across the street, for he and his friend were walking up the western side of Pennsylvania Avenue. "Harold, come over here, I want you!" The young man touched his hat and instantly orossed the street. Senator Mdllory, Mr. Harold!" said D vis by way of introduction. Then h said to Harold: "Did you go to Baltimore as I directed?" "I did, sir, and fulfilled your instruc- tions!" replied Harold. "Were you at the Circle there?" "I was, sir!" "Any new initiations?" "One, sir-one of the wealthiest. and most influential men in the State of Louisiana, I understood-one Colonel Melville!" "Melville Yes, I have heard the name. ,You see, Mallory, that all the South will be with us. You must join us and your position will be advanced in- stead of being lessened," said Davis. Then turning to Harold, he asked: "Did you see Booth?" "Yes, sir-I had an interview with him, Orsini, and the younger Surrats, to whom you bade me convey certain   messages. The Surrata have gone home, taking this Colonel Melville with them as a guest." "Ah-then I must take a run down there and see him myself and get him to contribute to the cause. At first we shall need money, but when once up, well armed, and our armies in motion, we can help ourselves from the hoarded stock of these Northern mud-sills. In yonder Treasury building there rests ta huge pile of yellow dross which must and shallgo to the support of the South- ern States of America." Mallory smiled in a rather sarcastic way. "I see," said he, "General Davis, that, like old Tom Benton, you go in for a specie basis!" "To be sure; for in the revolution which is to come and the curtain of that revolution will rise whenever I choose to give the signal, paper money will only make good cigar lighters-gold and silver only will be money!" "* Perhaps!" and again that strange, sarcastic smile was seen upon the face of the Floridian. "You will do me a favor, will you not, Harold " said Davis, not heeding the word or the smile. "Certainly, sir! Am I not bound to you in every sense?" "This will give you some trouble. I want you to proceed to Springfield, so disguised that your best friend would not know you and not to leave there until you learn the precise route he takes and the manner in which this President elect means to come to this city for his intended inauguration. No matter what expense you are at-find out the route and the precise time of his intended departure! Here is a check for five hundred dollars to start upon. Draw on me-no, that would not be safe-write to me, and I will remit whatever funds you need. Pass there as a Northern man: Southern men will be watched!"  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6976-00000016"/> "I will do your bidding, Sir!" "And Harold, write often, in the cypher which I showed you!" "Yes, sir!" "Then good-bye and remember that your duty is important. And now, Mallory, we will go and see Floyd and I will, I think, show you that the South is in a better condition for revolt than you dream of!" "I hope so-ifshe has butthe shadow of a chance I am with her-if she has not, I shall only counsel delay, for the storm must come sooner or later!" CHAPTER XII. "Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind I The thief doth fear each bush an officer." WHEN Atzerot reached the tavern at Surrattsville, as described by Young, who followed him, he engaged a room from the landlord whom he knew, and ordering a bottle of whiskey sent to it, went at once to his chamber. "Lloyd," said he to the landlord, "when you get time, come up to the room, I want to talk to you!" "Anything new or strange? Why do you not stay over at the Grove?' said the other. "Too much company-too many big- bugs, for me!" replied Atzerot. "Who is there, now V" "Some Southern Colonel, as rich as a Jew, carrying his own niggers to wait on him, and made as much of as if he were the Emperor of France or the King of the Cannibal Islands!" "Had Ibeenyou I shouldhave stayed. You are not as handsome as some men, nor as rich as others, but you have a sure hand and look upon blood as if it was water!" "Yes, and so would you fi you had shed as much of it as I have'" "When is the job that is in contem- plation now, to be done?" "Whenever we receive orders from Headquarters. We who are chosen   sw-v-rfm w. are all ready for the work, and I long to see it over, for I shall have money enough then to lord it all over Europe and settle in the land my father came from. Come up as soon as you can and I will tell you more!" Atzerot took a light and went to his room and in a few moments after the liquor which he had ordered was placed upon his table. Taking first a heavy slug of that, he lighted his meer- schaum and went to smoking. Suddenly he started to his leet. A carriage which had been driven rapidly to the door, stopped, and there was in a few moments -an unusual bustle below. He stood and listened by the window, and as he did so, he muttered: "Can the cursed detectives have got upon the track of our party? I don't like this living in suspense all the time. I wish the thing was done with and over. If they'd let me have my way there'd be no waiting-it is wearing me out. I wonder who has come. They make noise enough below." He walked to the room door and opening it a little listened there. He seemed better satisfied after doing so. "Some big-bug has come to stay all night!" said he. "And old Lloyd is just laying himself out to make a big thing of it. It will all come out fn the bill in the morning." He now walked to and fro in the room smoking and occasionally taking a nip from the whiskey bottle. In about half an hour, the landlord came into the room. "Who do you think is my guest to- night!" he said in a low tone, as he took a, seat.       4 "I haven't the least idea - but know he must be something extra, or you wouldn't make such a fuss over him!" replied Atzerot. "It is General Jefferson Davis!" said Lloyd. "He is on his way to Surrat's, but it was so late he concluded to stay   over here and go on in the morning!" "Jeff. Davis? By Jove, it is lucky.  I must see him. He is my banker, just now, and cash is getting low with me. t Where is he!"           I "At his supper now-you had better t wait till morning to see him!" "Devil the bitwill! You go down  to him and mention in a casual way c that a' K. G. C.' is stopping with you, a who has a key to the White House. I You'll see then whether or not he will 1 be glad to see me. Speak to him the t moment he is done his supper!" "I will, but he may not ike it!" "I'll risk that. He'll tell you to put X my bill in with his own when he pays 1 it!" "Well, your message shall be de- livered. Do you want anything else to-night?" "Yes-when he comes. up send up some cigars and a good bowl of punch.  When I have a favor to ask of a man I always mellow him by good treatment and then I am sure to get what I want!" "A good plan!" said the landlord, as he left the room. The word sent by Atzerot to Jeffer- son Davis acted with magic effect. No sooner had Lloyd delivered his message, than' Davis rose, from the table and said: "Show me to the gentleman's room instantly!" "Gentleman? One of the kind you may read about, but seldom see!" mut- tered Lloyd in a low tone to himself, as he at once led the way to Atzerot's room. "Here it is, General!" he said, as he paused at the door. "Shall I goin and  introduce you?" "I need no introduction, nor needyon go in. I wish to be alone with the gen- tleman!" replied Davis. And he gave four rapid knocks upon the door. A quick exchange of signs took place   and Davis at once extended his hand to the ill-looking wretch before him. Lloyd, who though afriend to and a tool of the members of the order, did not belong to it, and he looked in as- tonishment at the friendly manner in which his distinguished guest treated a man whom he knew to be of the lower class, and at best only a desperado,  whose knife and pistol were always ready for hire. But being dismissed by Davis he went down to his bar to send up the cigars and punch which Atzerot had ordered. "Your name, Brother?" asked Davis, as he closed the door, speaking only loud enough to be heard by the man he questioned. "Atzerot!" was the reply. "Atzerot, initiated in Baltimore, and selected for work?" continued Davis. "Yes, and anxious to do the work and get my pay for it. Funds are. low with me, General!" "Arethey? Well I will see that they are not before I leave. How long have you been stopping here?' "Only a couple of hours.   I was boarding with Surrat, awaiting orders from you, but a lot of company came ) there to-night. And I don't like com- ,pany, so I left!" "Who was there when you left?" "Do you mean the strangers?" "Yes." "John Wilkes Booth the actor was I one-the other was a Colonel Melville, -who puts on more airs than a foreign prince could. I questioned his niggers s pretty close about him, but I couldn't make anything out of them. I didn't like him much and came away." 1 I will see who and what he is in the morning, for I am going there!" "Do you know when we are to com- - mence work, General?" a  "Not until the old Rail Splitter starts for Washington. He will start unmo- e I -.- 1d. but he must never arrive there!"  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6976-00000017"/> "It shall not be my fault if he does. There are enough of us sworn to stop fifty such men as he, no matter what guards they have around them!" "Well, I hope you will all do your duty. The safety of the South depends upon it. If we can get Abe Tincoln, WIamlin, Bill Seward, Wade, Sumner and a few more out of our way, the South is safe and can be independent without a war. If he even gets to Washington and is inaugurated, there will be a bloody war as sure as I sit here. We will win our independence and save our niggers, but we'll have to fight for it. But if the K. G. C's, do their duty, we will succeed without a war!" Lloyd knocked at the door at this moment. He had brought the punch and cigars. Atzerot offered both to Davis. The latter took a glass of punch, but refused to smoke, saying that he was tired and intended retiring immediately. He would see hi -friend Atzerot in the morning. And he requested Lloyd to show him at once to his room, which the obse- quious landlord did immediately. CHAPTER XL. "He is composed apd framed of treachery." AT an early hour Colonel Armand Melville -was up and dressed, late as it was when he retired the night before. His servants, as usual, were in attend- ance upon him, and he was arrayed in a faultless walking suit when he went out to take a look at the surroundings of the Cedar Grove Mansion. Neither Bob nor Harry went with him on his walk. If he had ridden out, without company, one of them would of course have gone along. But on a walk, it was not only unnecessary, but might have created suspicion. So he went alone and care-    fully reconnoitered all the grounds, p near the house, before his host or aWy t of the family had walened up. He I wished to know the "lay of the land" in case of necessity. Just as he returned to the house after , having completed a survey which he thought might be useful thereafter, a neat travelling carriage was driven up to the door. "The head devil of them all!" he muttered to himself, as he saw and in- ; stantly recognized the occupant of the carriage. The elder Surrat, who had risen while the Colonel was taking his walk, hur- ried out when he saw the carriage draw up, recognizing the person in it, and as he did so exclaimed to Colonel Melville, "There is General Jefferson Davis, Colonel --, one of our greatest and truest men. The South will never suffer while he lives!" "Jefferson Davis? I am delighted to know that I shall have the honor of meeting such a distinguished man!" said the Colonel, with apparent plea- sure. "Introduce me if you please!"  The request was instantly complied with, and ten minutes afterward, Jeffer- son Davis, greatly pleased with his new acquaintance, was enjoying a freshy made mint julep in his company, at the side-board of Mr. Surrat. For as peach and honey mellows the mind for dreams before one retires to rest, the fresh and fragrant mint is supposed to waken up and invigorate the the dreamer when morning comes. So used to say South- ern philosophers and they always put the principle in practice. In a short time Booth and Young Sur- rat joined the party, going through the same course of practice, and then an earnest conversation upon the rights and wrongs of the South was carried on until the breakfast hour came. In this conversation, Melville took a first part, breathing nothing less than death and   a Ja &amp; J &amp;,iJE destruction to the Northern mudilyl, and advising even stronger Nmeasnes than Davis had yet proposed Booth was completely carried away with the zeal of the Colonel, and Davis thought with him and the Surrats, that the order of the "G. C." had gained a -noble member in the person of the rich Lo uiian planter. Wqhe breakfast time came, the ladies were fond at the table, and the meal was enlivened by their conversation. But the subject was still the same. Nothing seemed to be thought of in the ho e, but the conspiracy in which the parties under its roof were engaged. At least little else was spoken of. " 'saw a man named Atzerot, who proves himself to be one of us", said Davis in the course of the conversation. "I met him at Lloyd's tavern at Sur- ratville." "Yea. He left here last night, not liking to see company coming to the house " said Mr. Surrat. "I am glad he went. He is an igno- rant, ill-natured, ill-mannered boor," aid Mrs. Surrat. "He is a rough tool, but a desperate man and in our cause may do more efficient work than a more polished weapon, my dear Madam!" said Davis blandly. "We must not be too partic- ular about our company while the one great object is in view. That accom- plished, I should turn the cold shoulder to such persons as quickly as yourself, I assure you!" "It is diffioult for me to dissemble where I feel a dislike!" said the lady with a smile. t' But for the sake of our cause I can bear almost- anything, ex- cept lack of zeal in it!" And the lady looked at her husband in anything but a loving way when she spoke. "What is this Atzerot, of whom you speak!" asked Melville. "A born desperado addicted to gamb- ling, always ready for a quarrel in which *   he never comes out second best!" said John Surrat. "He fears neither God, man nor the devil. At Port Tohacco where he has lived for some time, he was so feared, that no society dared to refuse him admittance. He is, as Gen- eral Davis says, a rough tool, but he has plenty of courage and no conscience." "Brute courage, but no moral cour- age, I fear!" said Melville. "You have it precisely, Colonel!" said Mrs. Surrat. "Then mark me when the hour lor work comes, he will Tail!" said the Colonel. "I disagree with you, Colonel," said Davis. "Brute courage is all that we need in our tools. If the leaders have the moral courage to plan and to com- mand, all they need from their subor- dinates is blind obedience!" "You should be a better judge than myself, General, from your long experi- ence as a soldier and a statesman. Yet you may find out that my judgment is correct in this case." "Possibly, Colonel, possibly!" replied Davis. "By the way, how long will you remain here. I should be delighted if you would honor me with a visit at Washington before I go South, which I must do in a very few days. There are too many abolitionists gathering into Washington to suit me, and I want a healthier climate to perfect my plans in." "My stay here must be very limited, only four or five days at the longest," replied Melville. "Then I must return to Baltimore where I have a couple of schooners building to use in carrying off the sugar and molasses from my lower plantations. But I can take Washington in my route back and will be pleased to do so." "Po, my dear Colonel, do. My ad- dress is on that card-when you arrive, come at once to my house, and do not pain me by going to a hotel!" "Thank you, General, I shall surely avail myself of your kindness!"  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6976-00000018"/> After an hour at the table, the party rose to adjourn to the sitting-room, and arrange plans for a day of pleasure. ,HAPTER XIV u And tho' I hope not hence unscathed to go, Who conquers me, shall find a stubborn foe." BrON. IT was three weeks later. Colonel Armand Melville was the occupant of the same rooms in Baltimore, in the Secession Hotel, which he had taken when 'we first introduced him to the reader. His visit to Cedar Grove had been concluded, his promised call upon General Jeff. Davis paid, and he was again in Baltimore, ostensibly to see to the building and fitting out of his schooners, but really, as the reader knows, to ferret out the plotters gather- ing together for the destruction of our Union by cutting off its chosen chief and strongest supporters.. He was in his inner chamber, and Young and Barker, still disguised as negro servants, were with. him. In spite of the disguise of color, the faces of both of the latter plainly showed that they were agitated and anxious. Wilkins was holding a letter in his hand which he had just read to them, an anonymousletter, just received a few moments before by him, in which a hint of his real character was conveyed, and a threat of a fearful vengeance made if he proved to be indeed a traitor. "What till you do, Wilkins? If our real characters are indeed discovered, we are good as gone up P' said Barker. "Not quite, my boy!" said Melville, with a quiet smile. "You both have known me long enough to understand me I think. No paper threat ever caused me before to swerve from my duty, and it will not now! You ask what I will do. There is a meeting of the Knights of the ' Golden Circle' to- night. I shall go there, with this very   r letterin my hand, read it, and demand if the author of it is present, that I may brand him as a liar!" "But suppose that they really have found you out-your life will be taken in spite of fate!" "If they attempt that game, enough of them will go down to pay for it. You know how well I am always armea I and how well too I know how to use my, ' weapons. If I fall a half dozen at least will go down with me. And if I am not back at two o'clock, this letter handed to the military commandant at Fort McHenry will give you'help to find my body and arrest every one of the traitors whom I go to meet. There is a complete list in it." "Well, blow me up with a Drury Itorpedo, if I'd go into their den for ten thousand dollars in gold!" said Young. "Money will not carry me so far as duty. That you well know!" said Wilkins with a quiet firmness which well became his noble cast of counte- nance. "I have entered into this matter with my whole heart, and so help me GOD! I will carry it through, or die in the attempt! I have found out the head and front of a terrible conspiracy, and if I can kill it before it gains strength for action, I shall have done an act of which any patriot might well be proud. I know that my life is, as it were, in my hand, but he who ventures most f :arlessly is often the most fortunate. I shall not falter, and I chose you two to aid me, because I knew that you were as stubborn and tenacious as any men in the force, when once on a clue!" "T We will not fail you-we are only anxious for your safety!" said the de- tectives. "Never fear for that. Let the worst come to the worst, and they shall not only know who I am, but that every one of them is ' spotted' and liable to arrest, the moment that harm comes to me, or I am missed by my friends. If after that they try the pistol or the   dagger they will pay dearly for the trial." "Well, heaven speed you! We will 'both be near the Calvert street crib, to- night, and should but a single shot be heard in there to-night you will find a couple of brace of good revolvers there to aid you in less than a minute!" said Barker. "It would be better that you took my letter to Fort McHenry!" "It shall be put in hands that will t ke it there speedily if it is necessary. But if you get'into trouble, you surely willnot denyusthe chance to tryto help you out of it." "No, boys-no, I will not. But I think I can face the matter out. I have got a lot of letters, splendidly got up;as coming from well-known citizens of Louisiana, introducing me to certain  well-known sympathizers with the South in this direction. These I shall carry with me. If a member of the order has written this letter, and should acknowledge it, I will first prove that I am what I purport to be, Colonel Ar- mand Melville, and then I will force the writer to acknowledge it, or put him under the sod in an honorable way, as a Southerner should; put him under the sod as skillfully as that miserable wretch Terry did our poor friend, Dave Brod- erick, in California!" 'iYou might find a Terry in your op- ponent!" said Young, sadly. "No fear of hat. I know the tricks of such men and can beat them at their own game. When a man like Johl Travis pronounces me the best shot in New York at the word, himself alone excepted, and when Vaughan says my match never entered his gallery, you need not fear that I shall stand alo-ing chance with che Baltimorian chivalry, if I do have to stand up at ten paces with one of them." "We know you are good with your tools, but luck will throw the best man in the world!" said Barker.   "Good luck will not throw me, and I have a streak of it, so farin this case, and I think it will continue. I must leave you now boys, for it is time the Circle met. Remember what I told you!" And the Colonel replaced the letter and his papers in his pocket, and exam- ined his weapons. Finding them all ready for use, he at once started for Calvert street. CHAPTER XV. I do defy him, and spit athim; Cat. him - a slanderous coward and a villain I' SHAKSPSABM. WRAPPED in a heavy, full circle cloak, Armand Melville strode rapidly from the hotel to the building which had been rented in Calvert street, os-  ltensibly as a private Club House-but ieally by and for the mysterious order of the "Knights of the Golden Circle." Using the signals and pass words ne- cessary to gain admittance, the daring detective in a few moments, after pass- ing three doors, strode into the closely draped hall where the members of the order were already assembled. A loud and apparently excited debate was going on when he entered, the Italian, Orsini, being upon the floor. But when Melville entered the room, the speaker paused; there was a dead silence, and every eye was bent upon him. Most men would have felt and shown some fear in him situation, but Melville just as calmly as if he knew that every man there was a dear friend, walked quietly to the upper end of the room, and bowing to the Knight commander of the Circle, said: "Most noble Commander, I must crave pardon for being a late comer. When the debate is over, which my en- trance seemed to have interrupted, I shall be glad to explain the cause of my delay.' X  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6976-00000019"/> "Sir Knight, I regret to say that the debate you speak of was concerning yourself. A most serious charge has been made here to-night against you!" replied the commander. t "I stand ready to meet all charges, disprove all calumnies and punish all calumniators!" replied Melville boldly. '"The cause of delay this evening was the endeavor to find out some cowardly wretch who has sent me an anonymous, threatening letter, charging me with being a different person from what I am and have represented myself to be. If I can find the man who wrote that let- ter I will make the scoundrel beg my pardon on his bended knees, or I'll have his black heart's blood. "I have proofs with me of who and what I am, and no anonymous villain shall asperse my character with impu- nity." "Do you call me a villaine, Sare? cried Orsini, rising to his feet, his face actually blue with rage. "If you wrote that letter or made such a charge against me, yes, a doubly damned, infernal villain!" "Sare for zat word you die!" shrieked the Italian, as he tore a long poignard from its sheath inside of his vest. "Not too fast with your edged tools, barber!" said Melville, and as quick as thought, a cocked Colt's Revolver was on level with the Italian's head. "One step toward me and you die with your accursedlies yet fresh on your lips." "Hold, Sir Knights, hold! No vio- lence in this hall which does not come from due authority!" cried the com- mander, loudly. "Orsini, you have made a charge-if Colonel Melville can disprove it, you deserve all that he has said and more, for the Circle will not retain a slanderer. If you prove the truth of your charge, the Colonel will not leave the Circle in the mannerwhich he entered it to-night." "Let the man make his charge before my face as he did in my absence," said   Colonel Melville, who, with his pistol still covered the eye of the baffled bravo. "Then I can reply to it. All I ask of this noble Brotherhood is the rights of a true man and a Southern gentleman." "Those you shall have," said the commander.   "Orsini, repeat your charge!" The Italian with a look of vindictive hate replaced his poignard in its sheath and said: "Sare Knight Commandare-I shall say zat zis morning, when zat man zat call himself Colonel Melville, come to my saloon to get shave, he was recognize by one friend of mine as a police-officare from New York. I make my friend write to him ze lettare o which he complain, and for which he call scoundrale!' For zat I will eat his heart!" And the Italian ground his teeth in fury. "' What have you to say to that, Colonel 7" asked the Commander. "There are a dozen refutations ot the foul lie!" said Melville, as with a haughty air he laid a package of letters upon the desk, behind which the Commander sat "Be pleased, Sir Knight Commander, to read aloud, or cause those letters to be read aloud. The names of those who wrote them, and perhaps their signatures too, are well known to you. After those letters an read, I have yet other proof to give." The Commander at once took up the pac age, and over the names of General Twiggs Engineer Beauregard, and eight or ten mor of well-known Southern men, read commen datory letters directed to their friends, speak. ing of Colonel Armand Melville as a radic Southern rights' man, worthy of every co sideration. ' Do you know any of the writers o those letters, Sir Knight?" asked Melvilll when the Commander had read the las letter. "Yes, four of them well, Sir Knight, and their letters are all the proof of your faith that I desire," replied the Commander. "Yet not all that I will give," said Mel ville, as he cast a look of withering scon at Orsini, who had sunk back, glowering   like a mad hyena, into his seat. "My next proof is my letter of credit from the State Bank of Louisiana, deposited in your Ex- change Bank in this city. My next, the business which brought me here and my letters of introduction to my shipbuilders by a house in New Orleans, which has a branch house here, by which those letters can be verified. Next yet, the honor of a man who will not allow that honor to be anllied by a base slander, er to be questioned with im- punity!" "Colonel Melville, you stand entirely exculpated!" said the Commander. "By me, at least, and, I presume, by the entire Circle!" "Yes, yes!" rose from every lip in the room, save one. Orsini remained silent. "Orsini, your charge is groundless-you listened to the voice of a stranger, of a man who does not belong to our order and have tried to bring a worthy brother into discredit. You owe him and this or- der an humble apology. After that is made, we will consider what further course to take in regard to your offence 1" "Bare Knight Commandare, I nevare will apologise to a man zat call me one I scoundrale. He shall fight me, SaJe-he shall fight me, so sure as I see ze sun of  to morrow!" "If he was a gentlean instead of a barber I would take sincere pleasure in fighting him, for he deserves a broken leg for his  slander!" said Melville in a careless, con-  temptuous tone. "Sare-I am  a gentleman-a Count,  Bare-a COUNT? I am no barbare, if I do keep a barbare saloon for a disguise. 1 8are-ze best blood of Italy is in my i veins!" cried Orsini, purple with anger.  "Well, get a gentleman for your second, x and I will let out some of the best blood in Italy 1" said Melville with a sneering 1 smile which almost drove the poor Italian wild. "Mr. O'Laughn, you have been my I hiend zis many days-will you not be my i   friend till I kill zat man t" cried Orsini, appealing to a dark faced, evidently Southern man, who looked more like a professed gambler than a gentleman. "I'm always willing to se a fight and can take a hand in one when it is really necessary. But I think you are wrong in this matter, Orsini," repliedt O'Laughn "You had better apologize and with- draw." "Nevare-nevare, if I die a thousand times. I will fight if I have not a friend in ze world!" "Well, if you can get no one else to act you shall not say you arefriendless-I will stand by you!" said O'T aughh. "That being settled I will refer you with his permission to my friend J. Wilkes Booth," said Melville, quietly, "instruct- ing him and asking you to bring the mat- ter to an issue at the earliest possible mo- ment, for I do not like delay in such mat- ters." "I will leave the room in company with Mr. Booth, with the permission of the Knight Commander, and we will arrange matters as speedily as possible," said Or- sini's second. ' The permission is granted-such matters though unpleasant cannot well be settled otherwise by gentlemen," re- plied the Knight Commander. "And I crave ze same permission to go, for I wish to prepare! said 0- sini. The Knight Commander coldly bowed his assent, but made no reply. "As I need io preparation for sueb little matters, I will remain here until the Circle is regularly closed!" said Melville, with a quiet smile, which made Orsini angrier than ever. "Ze little mattare will cost him one life!" he cried, as he left the room. "It may cost a life, but not my own'* said Melville, as he took his seat, pre- paratory to the resumption of the busi- ness of the Circle.  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6976-00000020"/> CHAPTER  XVI.  "It a a pity-4o it Wa, no TnaiIam Ugpetre shdhouWl digged Oret he boelw of the haromlet earth, Whih may a brae, pod bow bl dMtyei'" P An hour after snwise on the enisnng  morning in a wooded ravine, about o eight or ten miles west of Baltimore, there was a group assembled which  would have made a splendid scene for a ( 5bit to paint or a DarMky to sketch. f Prominent in the foreground were X Booth and O'T nughn,busy in arrang-  ing the final prelimiraries of the " little X affair which was about to come off. On the right rear, was Colonel Armsnd  Melville, smoking a cigar, while leaning f against a rock, and at the same time nandling and examiling a pair of hand- I some, mahogany-stocked duelling pis-  tols. Whether they were identical  with those once used by theoChevalier  Webb in his mortal affray with Mar- shall, of Kentucky, I have no means of knowing without consqltiig the great historian, James Gordon Bennett. But they looked like weapons meant for use. On theleft stood Orsini, pale, scowling, looking like the very fiend of hate, yet as nervous as a toper without his morn- ing bitters. Between the two, was a surgeon who had picked out a smooth rock upon which he had spread his case of instruments, ready for service, in case the bullet spared either of the combat- ant's lives, and left them in a condition where Lhe could skilfully add to their agony. At a distance of about a hundred yards were two carriages, left just at the mouth of the little ravine. The driver of one of the carriages sat quietly and unconcernedly on his box, but the two liveries servants of Colonel Melville, who had charge of the other, were moving restlessly to andfro, evincinghy their actions the keen interest they felt in the safety of the Colonel-   At last the two seconds conclud their conversation and proceeded walk of the distance fifteen paces, company. The ground marked, th proceeded to carefully load the pistol an operation which Melville narro watched, for hewell knew the necessi of care in that part of the programme "Ihope your friend has made will!" he said in a .careless way O'TLagh;, but in a tone loud enos for Orsini to hear. "' You have sett upon my favorite distance, I see, and shall be obliged to make a dead cen shot! ' "Be quick-be quick-I am dying kill zatman!" cried Orsini, his wh frame quivering with passion. ; "Tell him to say his prayers non he will never have another chanc continued Melville with the same  voking coolness, he pretending no ' hear the hissing remark of Orsini. "* Take your places, gentlemen!" c r Booth, with a clear, cheerful voice. ;  He was to give the word. A pistol, cocked, with the hair ger set, was handed to each man  was placed in the position, and then , usual directions for firing at the t -were given by Booth. For a moment the two men sto a silence, facing each other. Mel h with a calm, haughty, confident  e on his countenance-Orsini, scow e as if he would killwith his looks,  ;- he sent his ball upon its mission. a  During this moment, Booth ste ir back to his place midway betwee parties, but well out of their line d in a clear, ringing voice, gave ie word: er  Are you ready, gentlemen!" id  " eady!" was the mutual res ro of the principals. e,  "Fire! One-two-three!" re  There was no necessity of his  by ting beyond the word one, in that alt For at the word fire, the pistol he Melville was raised to a level wi   ye, his am slightly bent, not a muscle uiveringand atthe word "one" its bul- t went crashing through the forehead fthe wretched Italian, who with quiv- ring hand had not yet got what he in- eded to take, dliberate awn. As he leaped forward in his death goy,he fired his pistol; but the ball ent far wide of the mark, striking the ok where the surgeon had spread his plements, and scattering some of em over the ground beyond. "Never mind, Doctor," said Melville, ith a smile, "you will find no use for our tools. I shouldn't have killed the or devil, though, if he had not been infernally malicious. Heintendedto l me, and I had to put a ' preventer stay' upon him, as nautical men say." "It is indeed all over with him-I ever saw so dead a shot!" said the surgeon, as he rolled the body over, for Orsini had fallen upon his face, "My style is known in Louisiiana, and may become known here if one or o more hot-headed fools choose to challengeme!" saidthe Colonel. "Come, Booth, we may as well be getting back, for I feel an appetite for breakfast. This early rising and the fresh morning air make me quite ravenous. I sup- pose, as they came with him, Mr. O'TLnghn and the Doctor will see to the body- of the unlucky Count!" he added, taking out and lighting a fresh cigar while he spoke. Booth hurriedly picked up the pistols which belonged to Melville and with his principal at once proceeded to the car" riage, upon the box of which now sat Bob and Harry, quite unconcerned at this time, for they had seen that the only one in whom they feltinterestedwas safe. Booth had scarcely spokei since Or- sini fell, for his sudden death had for a moment shocked even him. He had seen many a mock death uponthe stage, but he never before hadseen a soulsent out of existence in an instant by . hand which knew no tremor.   When he and Melville, however, were seated in the carriage, and it was mov- ing back toward Baltimore, his tongue- gear got in order again, and he remark- ed to Melville, that the affair would lionize him in the city. "It will make men careful how they trifle *ith my name or reputation!" said Melville quietly. "That is the most satisfactory part of it. I did not care a snap for the poor devil, Orsini, and if he had not been so malicious, I would only have broken his arm. But I knew that if I spared him then, he would assassinate me whenever he had an opportunity; therefore I put him in a position where he could do me no more harm." "You must have had a great deal of experience in such matters, Colonel!" said Booth. "Some!" replied Melville, quietly. "The Creole French in my state are very quarrelsome, and I have had to cool off the anger of twelve or fifteen of them in the same way I did for the poor Italian. It is not pleasant, but a gentleman who lives South must pre- serve his honor, no matter what it costs!" "Yes-but I should fear, Colonel, ' that in so many affairs you might at last get hold of the wrong customer, and yourself get hurt!" "I never yet have met my equal, much less my superior in firing quickly and sure at the word!  Quickness is the thing. I never give my opponent time to fire!" responded the Colonel. Booth made no reply. He seemed buried in thought, and did not speak again until they were in the city. CHAPTER XVII. "see, winter comes, to rule the varied year, Sullen and sad, with all his rising train Vapors, and clouds, and storms."'-THoMPso5. The heavy gale which tossed the waters of the broad Chesapeake into a murky yeast of foam, whistled shrilly about the windows of the lofty Seces-  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6976-00000021"/> ison Hotel at Baltimore, and the coarse, hard sleet of winter was beating harsh- ly against them. But the very select company which was assembled in the large parlor of Colonel Armanal Melville, heeded little the loud gale which shook the window Basements or the cold hail that pelted the glass. The Cumberland coal which blazed brightly in the huge grate and the red wine and strong drinks which his guests were quaffing, kept them too warm to permit a thought of the out- side weather to enter their breasts. Those guests are already mostly known to our readers. Prominent among them was Jefferson Davis, a man destined to an immortality of infamy; John Wilkes Booth, another whose dark shame has bowed a whole family of worthy relatives into the dust; John H. Surrat, Harold, Page, Atzerot and other lesser ruffians, all gathered together to join in an enemy's revelry and to con- coct the final arrangements of the plot which had been made to deprive of life a President elected by a vast majority of the people, before he could even have the pleasureof being inaugurated. But one of those there assembled was a patriot, or a true man-he, Wilkins, or Melville, who was risking his life every moment to find out and foil their treason. The rest were fiends of dark- ness, hardly human Lin their devilish wickedness. "So let them stand, through ages yet unborn, Fix'd statues on the pedestal of scorn 1" "And so, Harold, you have found out all that I directed you to get fully in- formed upon, when I sent you West?" said Davis, addressing the same beard- toss youth whom we introduced to the reader some time since. "Yes, General-every item. The Rail Splitter will leave Springfield on the Eleventh of February. His route has been marked down. He takes rail by way of Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburg, Cleveland, Buffa-   lo,Albany, New York, Philadelphia, on through Baltimore to Washington. I have seen the programme in his own hand writing." "Good. He may get as far as Balti- more. He must never go beyond it." "He never-shall!" said Booth, excit- edly. "Not without my hand fails me!" said Atzerot. "If it does, it will be for the first time." "If yours does, mine will not!" said Payne, as he raised his bulky form from the chair on which he had been seated, and reaching to a decanter on the table half-filled his glass with pure brandy and drank it off. "It seems to me, gentlemen, that as the time for his approach is drawing so near, we ought to make owr plans of action definite, so that each may play his part and do it so correctly that there can be no failure in it!" said Melville. "The Colonel is right," said Davis. "He has with his purse proved him- self one of our aids, so far, and it is but just that we listen to his advice in the details of action." "I have no advice to give," said Melville, quietly. "You are all men more experienced in life than I. A plain planter like myself, who knows but little of men, especially Northern men, can but poorly advise you how to proceed. I can aid, but I will not pre- sume to direct anything." "The directions must come from you, General," saidBooth, addressing Davis. "We have had several plans discussed. That Orsini, whom the Colonel very bravely and properly put out of his and our way, would listen to nothing but torpedoes to be used on the railroad which Lincoln had to pass over, or to be thrown into the carriage which must convey him from one depot to the other. I objected to the plan because even if it succeed, our own friends would perish by the same explosion which would kill him. A single shot, one. sure dagger-   stroke, will do all that is needed for that one man, and then the others who are marked can be struck in detail in the same way." "You are right, Mr. Booth. And to you I will leave the full control of the plans here, all of these gentleman, I am sure, being willing to act under your guidance," replied Davis. "If any object, let them object now." No objection was made and a subor- dinate leader now knew what his duty would be. "I accept the position, General," said Booth. "But in spite of his modesty, I shall depend, greatly upon the advice of our noble friend and generous host, Colonel Melville." "I will consult with you, my dear Booth," said Melville, quietly. "But you must not depend upon any good which my advice will do." "Oh that is your way," said Booth with a laugh, as he ladled out a glass of punch from a large bowl in the centre of the table. "How long a time does he intend to occupy in coming on?" asked Davis, ad- dressing Harold. "With the stops he has promised to make, about two weeks," "Will he have any military escort?" "None. Two or three military men may be in his company-no regular escort." "Do you know any of them 1" "Only one, young Captain Ellsworth, who lately commanded the splendid Zouave company which drilled through the country. I got quite intimate with him, for he is a whole-souled fellow and boarding at the same hotel. I managed to get into his 'good graces. I found out nearly everything through him and by him got introduced to Lincoln and his family." "Passing as a Northern man, as I directed you?" "Yes, sir, as the son of one of the   most prnminent Republicans in New York." "That was a good dodge-you were well received without doubt!" "Yea, sir, very kindly and I made the most of my advantages to learn every plan on foot for the Washington trip." You have, done  spledidly, Mr. Harold, and you shall be well rewarded when the reins of powerare where they soon will be, in Southern hands." "Your praise is reward enough for any man, General," said Harold, blush- ing with delight. "You do not'drink your wine orliquor gentlemen-there is plenty of it," said Melville. "Help yourself freely. I am pleased when I see you enjoying my hospitality." "No danger of our slighting such good liquor, Colonel," said Atzerot, who seemed to have got completely over his first antipathy to Melville. ".You may bet your life on that!" said Payne, refilling his tumbler with brandy. "I propose the health of our host," said Booth, refilling his glass with punch. "A toast in which I will heartily join," added DIavis, filling his glass with golden sherry. "And then we'll give three rousing cheers to top off with!" said Harold, who, in cavalry parlance, began "to feel his oats " pretty sensibly. "I accept the compliment gratefully, gentlemen, but object most decidedly to the cheers. Remember that business as well as pleasure brings us together, and we want to attract as little attention as possible. We know not who may be spying. about this hotel. For my part I trust no one, not even my own ser- vants, though I know them to be faith- ful." "The Colonel is right," said Davis "We will drink health and happiness to him in silence. May all the friends  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6976-00000022"/> of our cause prove as true as he has een."! The brimming glasses were drained in a moment, and then in a few graceful and well uttered remarkt, Melville re- turned his thanks to his guests. He then-proposed the health of the great leader of Southern Independence, Gen- eral Jefferson Davis. This was drunk enthnsiastically, though not noisily, and then General Davis responded in a speech redolent of fire and brimstone, pledging himself to carry out the doctrine of Southern Sovereignty, or to die in the last ditch. He spoke so ardently, that Booth and Harold eould not refrain from applause. The difference between the effects of his language on them and'on the mere animals Payne andAtzerot was marked. The two latter drank their liquor but did not seem either to heed, understand or care for wheat the eloquent speaker was uttering; for to give the devil his due, Davis, though advocating an ac- cursed cause, spoke well. It was thus that he gained adherents, and led many a man once noble and true to the starry flag of our Union into Error's dark and fatal path. Specious, plausible, with a reputation for bravery which seems lately to have oozed out, the man was well fitted for the part he intended to play-the part which has made him and his name infamous beyond all redemp- tion. After he was through speaking the glasses again circulated, cigars andpipes were lighted and conviviality was kept up until long after midnight. During all this time Mellville seewed to drink as freely as the rest; but while all of them showed signs of the excess, and some got" well over the bay" on the lee shore of Tipsydom, he remained as cool and collected asif waterhadbeen his sole beverage, drinking in and men- tally noting down every word that was uttered.   K1UlJJAO:. CHAPTER XVII. Assalted by sandal and the togue of Ste, His nly answer wa a blameless life; And he that forged, and he that threw the dart,. Had each a brother's rterest inhis heart." Oown. It was the eleventh day of February, 1861. The clear sky, the bright sun looking down from its azure throne in heaven's lofty dome, shining softly on the frosted prairies of the State, and on the glittering domes of the town, then the residing place of the President elect of a nation which even treason aided by foreign treachery cannot de- stroy, all combined with the fluttering of banners from many a lofty staff, and. the sounds of martial music in the streets, and the gathering of handsome- ly uniformed soldiers and crowds of citizens, made a scene which those who witnessed it never can forget. The people were gathered together to do honor, on the hour of his depar- ture, to a man who for half his life had dwelt among them-who from almost obscurity, had risen to the highest ele- vation which man can reach *in this. great Republic. Abraham Lincolnwwas about to leave his fellow townsmen to take the helm of the Ship of State, at an hour too, when the most terrible storm that ever shook a world was gathering before him; a storm which he must master, or see the good old ship go down, down into the- fathomless waters of oblivion. It was a solemn hour and noone seemed to feel it more thanhe, the least proud, but the most exalted of them all. Listen to his parting words to his- friends and fellow townsmen: ' My friends: No one in my position' can appreciate the sadness I feel at this parting. To this people I owe all that 1 am. Here I have lived more than a quarter of a century; here my-children were born and here one of them lies buried. I know not how I shall see you again. A duty devolves upon me which is greater, perhaps, than that which de-   volved upon any o her man since the days of Washington. He never would have succeeded except for the aid of Divine Providence, upon which he at all times relied. I feel that I cannot succeed without the same Divine aid which sustained him, and on the same Almighty Eeing I place my reliance for support; and I hope you, my friends, will all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance without which I can- not succeed, but with which success is certain. Again I bid you an affection- ate farewell." Alas, never again did his calm, brave eyes look upon those home scenes. Stricken down in the hour of his great- estglqry, when the sun of an honorable peace *as just rising to gild his care- worn brow, his mortal race is finished. After the President had made his brief farewell speech and was about stepping on the car which was to con- vey him eastward, a person of genteel appearance steppedtohis side and hand- ed him a sealed package. "Mr. President," said he, in a low tone, looking at him with a firm and clear eye, "I beg you to read the paper I hatd you, carefully, and to heed the suggestions in it." "Who are you, sir t" asked the Presi- dent, a kind of troubled expression shading his benignant countenance. 4"A true triend to you and my coun- try, sir, who will be near you should peril arise in your journey, and whose duty itwillbetoguard against suchperils. You will surely see me again when you arrive in Philadelphia, and before, pos- sibly. I go to look after those whom you will find alluded to in the document which you hold in your hands." The President would have questioned him further, but he moved away sud- denly and in a moment he was lost to view in the dense crowd. "Ellsworth, did you notice the gentle- man who handed me this package?" asked the President of a splendidly built and very fine looking young man who stood by his side.   "Yes, sir-a magnifcent. looking man he was. Just the build for a sol- dier. That made me observe him par- tieularly!", was the reply. "Remember his looks. He says he will meet me in Philadelphia. I -must read what he has bSmded me when I get in the cars. It may be something about the rumor which so troubles my friends, but which does not alarm me; for my life is in the hands of the Al- mighty, and He will preserve me if it is His will, dida thousand assassms lay in wait for me between here and Washing- ton. This stranger looked like a friend." "* If he should prove a foe, sir, he will find that you have devoted friends near you, who will watch over your safety with sleepless eyes." "I know it, my dear boy, I know it!' said the President, kindly, as he laid his large, bony hand upon young Ells- worth's shoulder. "With such watch- fill friends as you and Lamon near me, I need not fear any surprise or any peril." "All aboard-time is up!" shouted the conductor of the train. In a minute more all who were going were "aboard" and the train was moving out from the depot. The perilous jour- ney was commenced . The President, as he had said he would, the moment that he had leisure, opened the package which the stranger had given to him. A person very intimate with him might have noticed a slight look of anx- iety on his massive face, but it was so slight that a stranger would not have observed it. He read the paper, quite a lengthy manuscript, carefully through, then folded it and placed it in an inner breast pocket of his coat. A sad smile passed over his face as he did so, and he said to Colonel Lamon who was sitting by his side: "I have infornmlt'  ' "',is to  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6976-00000023"/> be genuine, that there will be a gather- ing of enemies in Baltimore who will strive to prevent my reaching Wash- *ington." "Then, sir, you surely will take with you what has been offered, a military escort sufficiently strong to defend you against injury and prevent an assault?" "No, Colonel-I shall goto Washing- ton with no larger escort than I have at this moment. At least I must have 'greater proof of the necessity than I have now, before I show the example of a President going to his inauguration i surrounded by soldiery. My danger it appears is not near until I pass Phila- delphia-we will feel easy until we ge there at any rate." "I shall not feel easy, sir, until I see you in the White House with full Presi- dential power in your own hands. Then, those who threaten now will not dare to open their lips, much less will they dare to offer resistance to your will. I know you, sir; they do not, or they would be sparing with their threats!" "Never mind them, Lamon. They are disappointed in my being chosen and their candidate rejected. It is but natural that they vent their spleen somewhere. It may as well exhaust itself in threats against me, as in any other way. Threats do not kill, .my good friend!" "No, Mr. Lincoln. But where there is so much smoke, there must be fire. There is danger I know, but if watch- fulness can avert it, it shall neverreach you!" "Thank you, my dear friend, thank you!" And the Piresident relapsed into a thoughtful silence as the train sped on. CHAPTER XIX. "If, on the sudden he begins to rise, No man that lives can count his enemies.'* MmIDLTON. FROM Springfield to Philadelphia the t  r . .f tHe President was marked with   no mishap. In all of the cities tluoyIi which he passed, and most especially in those in which he made a brief stay, he had the fullest and most gratifying evi- dence thathe wasthe "People's choice," in the immense number of citizens who turned out to greet him and in a thou- sand ways to show their affection and their confidence. Even in the Democratic New York he was received with an eclat which show- ed her to be loyal, even if she was not Republican, and a Mayor, wooden-headed in all matters except the art of making money, made him a welcoming address as full of flattery as the heart of the speaker afterwards proved to . be of treachery, when his ambition overleap- ed itself and broke its neck in coming down. Even here, as at Springfield, the nolle President seemed to look out upon the storm which he so nobly met and over- came, doomed to perish by a traitor's ac- cursed hand, when he had carried the Ship of State through it into smooth waters. Said he in reply to the then Mayor* "MR. MAYOR :-It is with a feeling of deep gratitude that I make my ac- knowledgement for the reception which is given me in the great commercial city of New York. I cannot but remem- ber that this is done by people who do not by a majority agree with me in po- litical sentiment. It is more grateful because in this I see that for the great principle of our Government the people are nearly all or quite unanimous. In regard to the difficulties that confront us at this time, and of which your Honor has thought fit to speak so becomingly and so justly, as I suppose, I can only say that I agree in the sentiments ex- pressed by the Mayor. "In my devotion I hope I am behind no man in the Union. But as for the wisdom with which to conduct the af- fairs tending to the preservation of the Union, I fear that too great confidence may have been reposed in me. I am sure I bring a devoted heart to the work. There is nothing that could ever bring me to consent, willingly, to the destriec-   taon ot this Union, under which, not only t b great commercial city of New York but the whole country has acquired its greatness, unless. it were to be for that thing for which the Union itself was made. I understand the ship to be made for the carrying of the cargo, and so long as the ship can be sailed with the cargo it should never be abandoned. This Union should never be abandoned unless it fails and the possibility of its preservation shall cease to exist, with- out throwing passengers and cargo overboard. So long, then, as it is pos- sible that the prosperity and liberties of this people can be preserved in the Union it shall be my purpose at all times to preserve it. And now, Mr. Mayor, again thanking you for the re- ception which has been given me, allow me to draw to a close." quote his words, for this story is strictly historical and, would space per- mit, it would be but just to the great departed, to follow him upon everystep of that last journey in life from his pleasant home to the scene of his stern duties and his sad martyrdom. But time and space cannot now be spared, and the novelist must give place to the historian, whose works will be immortal, while short-lived fiction will but too'soon pass away, no matter how strong its foundation. Mr. Lincoln had arrived in Philadel- phia where that sober-sided, quaker- moulded city almost ran mad with delight at his coming. With his own hands, on the morn of Washington's birth-day, he raised an American flag over the Hall of Independence, where the immortal Declaration was signed, which all the power of haughty England could not annul.         - He was standing with his friends, those who had accompanied him from hs home, a few moments later in the Continental Hotel, after he had grace- fully performed the duty just spoken of, preparing to take his next journey to Harrisburg, the Capital of the Keystone State. And Keystone she has proved indeed in the struggle which ihs pre-   servedl the arch of the Cuion, for no State, except New York alone, has sent so many men to the field, or sacrificed so much blood and treasure. "The friend who handed me the de- tails of the plot which was to keep me from reaching the. White House, and who in Springfield promised to meet me here, seems to have forgotten me and his promise also!" said the President, with a smile, speaking to Colonel Lamon, Ellsworth, and some other of his friends, who stood near. "He has forgotten neither, Mr. Presi- dent, and having joined you here, he will not leave your side again until he sees you in the city of Washington, where General Scott, the heroic old patriot, has gathered all the force that a corrupt government will allow, to de- fend you and protect you. during your coming inauguration." The speaker was he whom we have known so far as Colonel Armand Mel- ville, who had noiselessly joined the party. But his long flowing hair, his jetty moustache were gone, and only by his stalwart and manly form, his eagle eye and nobly chiselled features would you recognize him now. His diamonds were laid aside, his negro servants were not in this train, he looked likeanything but the Louisiana planter which he had been so long.     "Who are you, sir?" asked Mr. LibL coin, regarding him attentively. "There are my credentials, sir," re- plied the detective. "I wish now and until we reach Wasi: i'gloto, be known as Mr. E. J. Allen, af)fJied of yours from the Prairie State. I'as employed months ago, by some of the wealthiest and truest of your supporters to ferret out a plot supposed to be concocting for the overthrow of the Union and your own personal destruction. I have suc- ceeded, by becoming initiated in a ter- rible and powerful order formed for that pur'ose, and only t-. h!ours have  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6976-00000024"/> L-.eC ;itcc I lefst them while they were holding theirfinal meeting, prepar- atory to your inten de murder 1" "This is indeed startling, but live or die, I must go through!" said the noble patriot as he glanced at the papers just handed to him. "Sir, if you will but follow my advice, you shall go through in safety. Know- ing every plan formed, I alone am pre- pared to evade the assassion and to con- duct you safely to the place where Gen- eral Scott can guard you. All of the conspirators are assembled in Balti- more, where even the hearts of the po- licemen are filled with treason, as are their pockets with the gold of treachery. My papers will show that I am, to be trusted. I have risked my life a thou- sand times to get this information, and I will lose it, or take you safely through." "(I will trust you, Mr, Wilkins, and take your advice in every particular," said the President. "But you must not advise me to disappoint the noble Gov- ernor of this great state in a visit to his capital." "No, sir. I wish to see that visit made." Then in a lower tone he added: "A special train, in advance of the pub- licly advertised train, which is to take you to Washington, will be ready to take you on and' through Baltimore, while the conspirators wait for the last mentioned train. On that special train, you, myself, and two of the truest men on my force will be the only passengers. The other train will' bring on your friends and family at the time adver- tised, some eight or ten hours later." "Willnot this arrangement expose my friends and family to the danger which menaces me?" asked the President, thoughtfully. "They must meet no danger which I do not share." They will not be endangered, sir. The moment you are safe in Washing- ton, I will cause it to be telegraphed to every paper in Baltimore, and all through the country. The conspirators   who seek your life only, AAI soe * aixt they have been foiled, and I shall send a message to their leaders, over the r wires, which will scatter them in terror, for they will know that they have been t betrayed and beaten at their own game. They will attempt nothing after you have passed, if you only do pass in safety." "Then, I will risk all with you, Mr. Wilkins, and if success crowns your plans you may rely upon my .kind ,re- membrances hereafter." "Thank you, Mr. Lincoln, I will do my best. And as it is now near time, I will leave you, but I shall not be a mo- ment out of sight of you until you are in Washington. At Harrisburg I will again confer with you, and you will there receive from Governor Curtin, who knows me well, renewed assnrance of my fidelity." "It is well, and now the cry is on to Washington," said the President smil- ing and warmly pressing the hand of the brave detective before he turned I away from him. And thus leaving him we will go to take a look at the conspi- rators, who like a band of hungry tigers, wait for their intended victim. CHAPTER XX * But be not long, for in the tedious muttesr Exquisite interval, I'm on the rack; For aure te gratest evil mn can know, Bears no proportion to this dread suspense." IT was midnight. The order of the Knights of the Golden Circle was as- sembled in secret conclave in their Hall. The principal leaders and actors in the conspiracy which we have so far followed, were all there. Anxiety was expressed upon every face and their debates were carried on in low and earnest tones. It wns ten minutes after twelve, and Saturday, the twenty-third day of February had come into existence, when   u.... ViKes Booth entered the hall with a hurried step. "Have you news, Sir Knight?" asked the Grand Conmmnd4er,.-  "I have just heard from our Brother  Knight, Colonel Melville, by telegraph.  He transmits by our secret figures, notice that the train which bears oura treasure, will leave Harrisburg at six o'clock this morning. Therefore it will be here at eleven, giving us plenty of time for all our preparations." "Itj long timeto wait. My suspense  grows with each' moment of delay!" said Jefferson Davis, who occupied a seat by the side of the Knight Com- mander of the Circle. "If we fail in our enterprise, it will go hard with any one who may be captured. If we succeed, the power will be in hands that are able and willing to shield all who are concerned!" "General-there we will be no such word as fail," said Booth. "So far, Lincoln has been greeted so warmly on his journey, that it has given him a fearless confidence in his people. Dis- pensing with guards, mingling boldly with all who choose to greet him, shaking hands with every mudsill that offers his paw, he has left himself, if he does the same thing in Baltimore, in a position which will render out work easy. We must surround him in a body, pretending anxiety to take him by the hand, cheering as loud as the loudest and when we, the sworn and the faith- ful, are all around him, one blow with the dagger will end him so quickly and so quietly that no one outside of us will ever know by whom the blow was struck." "' That blow, and a few more given as surely, will make the South inde- pendent and preserve her institutions forever!" 2said Davis, nervously. "But remember, brothers, there must be no failure. If we succeed, the people here will be all with us. If we fail, we will find enemies everywhere. Success   makes villainy a virtue-failure makes a noble action a crime." "Here is something that never failed me yet!" said Payne, as he drew a twelve-inch blade bowie knife from its sheath. "The last time I used it, I had a row in the Galt House, in Louis. ville. I had about a dozen mint juleps aboard, and it took me about a minute to clear the bar of as genteel a set of loafers as ever wore kid gloves." "Will not the police be in otu way at the depot when the ears arrive?" asked one of the more timorous Knights. "The more of them that are there the better it will be for us?" replied Davis. "The chief is with us heart and hand, and none of his men will interfere ex- cept to aid us. That is understood." "And about our leaving for a health- ier climate, if the weather should hap- pen to grow too hot here " suggested another. "The steamboat Gladiator is now lying in the basin with steam up. She is now ready for a trip to Charleston, and will carry passengers free who can prove themselves Knights of the G. C. at any moment after the blow is ;struck." "You see brothers, that everything has beenforeseen, everything prepared : for," said Booth. "I now propose that we adjourn to meet, all armed, but our weapons concealed on our persons, at eight o'clock at the depot!" "Yes, that will be best, for it wil give you all time to take some rest an I to get your nerves calm and steady foi work. Let me counsel you all to avoid drinking and not to be excited., Per- fect coolness now is necessary!" sai 1 Davis. "I agree with the General; it is s a ordered. If success crown our efforts t the Circle will meet here at the usua o hour to-night, for it is already on in th e morning!" said the Knight Command I er. s  And at a sign the "Circle" rose an  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6976-00000025"/> with the usual salute dispersed and left the room. Little did those conspirators dream that, at that very moment, their intend- ed victim, accompanied only by his faithful friend Lamon and the three de- tectives, was passing quietly through Baltimore, on his way from one depot to the other, and that the early train to Washington was carrying' the hope of the Nation out of the reach of their murderous hands. CHAPTER XXI. s We have cherished f air hopes, We have plotted brave schemoa, We have lived till we find Them illusive as dreams." IT was nine o'clock, A. M., still the same day, February, twenty-third, 1861. Around the depot at which the Eastern train was soon expected to ar- rive, a large body of people had already assembled. These were not, however, fdging from their looks or apparel, the best class of citizens which Baltimore could turn out. Some few respectable looking people were there, but the low and ruffiauly seemed to compose the majority. There was a sparse scatter. ing of policemen through the crowd, i but they were too well-known as being  under the control of the blackest Seces- sion leader in the city, to be at all fear-  id by any of the mob which was gather- ( ed there for anything but a peaceful  purpose. ' The Knights of the Golden Circle, all 1 of them disguised in various ways, were - in a body nearest the spot where the a passenger cars always came to a stop.  Davis was not there. Like some other 1 Generals not "unknown to fame" he preferred to take position in the rear c where he could look with safety upon I the deeds of his subordinates.   1 It was half past nine, when an in-  dividual, with heavy whiskers, dressed i like a common laborer, whose eye alone X   KIltUWSlDE t would have told an intimate friend that he was John Wilkes Booth made up for the ocetsion, stepped in amongst the conspirators. His nervous action and agitated man- ner proved that he had news for them. It was soon spread, for he whispered to one or two of the leading men and then went from man to man the information that their intended victim had escaped the toils laid for him. He was already in Washington, with the eagle-eyed, and even loyal General Scott, watching over his safety. The plans oft the Brotherhood of the Golden Circle had been discovered and frustrated. It was strange how quickly the news circulated through the vast crowd. And faqes which had been wearing a look of swaggering courage, began now to look pale, and there was a low murmuring hum of voices as the disappointment was eagerly discussed. By some it was not yet believed, but when the Chief of Police, with a blank look of disappointment upon his face entered tfo depot with a telegraphic dispatch in his hand and announced to his force that they need not remain, that the distinguished individual whom they were to receive and protect (7) had already passed through the city, then all doubts gave way. Alarmed, they hardly knew why, the Knights of the Golden Circle hurried off, the most of them to their hall to re- ceive further information or instruction, and some, and those too who had been the loudest in their talk of what they would do and dare, started for the steamboat which had steam up and a clearance for Charleston already on board. Upon arriving at the hall the chief conspirators learned that General Davis had already left for the South, leaving word to all who wished to share his fortune to follow him. That they had been betrayed and there was no safety for him except in the South where   he would at once raise the Secession flag. This decided the majority of the conspirators. They made but few pre- perations to leave. Terror at their failure and fear of arrest hung heavily upon them, and three hours later not one of that secret conclave remained in Baltimore. The Gladiator had sailed with a full passenger list. Booth, still disguised, did not leave for the South, but in company with John Surrat he hurried off to Cedar Grove to bury his disappointment in the dark shade of that retired spot. Where now was their devoted and zealous friend, Colonel Armand Mel- vjle? Booth had fears for his safety. For Melville had volunteered to go on and watch the movements of the Presiden- tial party and to keep the conspirators posted by telegraph in a way which only could be understood, by them- selves. His dispatch was dated in Harrisburg and when translated from the figures used by the order, read in  this way! "Our bird is gone. He left last night, instead of this morning, and his friends  here have just got a dispatch from him i at Washington, stating that he arrived ' there safe at six o'clock this morning. 1 Were you blind in Baltimore? I am in a danger here and must leave."  This was the news first. conveyed to i the waiting conspirators by Booth and m so soon afterward confirmed by the e Chief of Police.          s And that was all that Booth knew of X Melville or his whereabouts when he 1 left Baltimore for Cedar Grove. But f left a note for him, offering him, by re- e ques tof Mrs. Surrat, an asylum at the t Grove, if he did not wish imntediately y to go South.           I   lI   . CHAPTER XXII.

Surrat and his friend Booth rode up to the mansion at Cedar Grove, upon horses covered with foam, there were three persons upon the piazza, waiting anxiously for the news which they had brought. Mr. Surrat stood there pale and tremulous, Anna, the daughter, looking anxious; cold and calm, but with a look of cruel pride upon her features, stood the grey- eyed wife and mother, the strongest- character of them all. "Well, my brave boys-is the good deed done?" she cried, as the two riders dismounted from their panting horses. "No-curse the luck, no!" said John Surrat. "He escaped us and we have had to scatter!" "Thank God there is no blood on your hands, John!" said Mr. Surrat, with a feeling of relief. "Coward! I would rather he had been covered with blood from head to foot than that our plans should fail!" cried Mrs. Surrat, casting a withering look of scorn upon her husband. "If as I desired, I had gone myself, there would 'not have been a failure. But you-you opposed it, and I, weak, too weak, allowed myself for once to be gov- erned by your wishes. But mark you sir, it is for the last time. I am sick of such a white-livered thing as you are. You are willing enough to take money from Davis and his friends, but guarded enough in exposing your carcass when the money is to be earned. How did you fail, Mr. Booth?" "Our secrets were betrayed by some  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6976-00000026"/> lw me, I think For il no ther y ai he haoe been put ons guard so a  to s deceive us ,"           di "S ecrete it,-ayeit?" and as she spoke, the wioman turned again and lookedsat Ipe her husband as if he wold search into i the recesses of his very soul. "If 1  everdiscover the one who has betrayed hi those secrets, his life will not be worth w1 a breath!" aYou need not look so hard at me, h Mary!",aid Mr. Surrat, nervously I " never have hinted a thing wich could es draw attention to our plans."  "Perhaps not! If you have it il m be the worse for you!" was the only a reply he got. Servants now came to take the horse a and the family went into the house. u ",The chiefs of the Order have not given the business up, have they i"Mrs.  Surrat asked, when they were seated.  "For the present, I think they have,"  replied Booth. "Davis has gone south  and the whole band is scattered."  "Fools-fools! There is plenty of 1 time yet before the inauguration day. e Oh, I wish that I was a man-I would 4 show you men what to do. Thete is I need now of a Charlotte Corday in this land, and I fearthat I shallhave to play the part. Do you not think I could do it, Mr. Booth?" "You would play Lady MaCbeth capitally, my dear madam!" said Booth, who looked with admiration upon the stern and vindictive woman. "I have not a Machethfor a husband. Surrat has no more nerve than a sick baby!" she said as she looked upon Mr. Surrat with an expression of cnmpt even stronger than her words. "Marr, you were the first to lead me into this matter, and I have regretted it from that hour to this!" said the husband. "And now I am done wit it. I never will again touch the gold of Davis, or harbor his emmissaries!" "1 Then you will turn our good friend   Mr. Booth outof doors" she cried with a sarcstic sneer. ,By no means-Ma   you know I did not mean that! Mr. Booth is our personl friend and guest. I meant such men as Payne and Atzerot. No, I think too much of Mr. Booth to class him with the low-bred annoyances whom even you hate." "I would have loved and honored them if they only succeeded in destroy- ing the man who was doomed, but has escaped!" replied Mrs. Surrat. '"But his escape is only temporary, for if no man can be found who will do the deed, a woman exists who can and will do it. For just as surely as he lives a bloody and desolating war will come upon us!" "Yes, and what will start it!" said Surrat with more vigor in his manner than he had yet shown.  "Nothing - 'more or less than the ambition of such h men as Davis, Rhett, Cobb and old Wise. I know them all. Itis cursed ,f little they care for the South or South- r. ern rights, but a great deal that they do d care for themselves and their own ad- is vanicement!" is  "You are anold fool and do not know by what you are talking about. You slan- lo der better men than yourself every breath you breathe!" cried Mrs. Surrat, th reddening with anger, as she rose and ;h, left the room. he CHAPTER XXIII. d. "There glides a step thro' the foliage thick, ik And her cheekgrows paleand her heart beats quick dr. There whispers a voice thro' the rustling leaves ,pt And her blush returus and her bosom heaves." THE stars looked down from a cloud- me less sky on the evening which followed ted the day when Booth and the younger the Surrat returned jaded and disappoint- rih ed to Cedar Grove. There was no ;old moon, but the glittering stars shone s!" witha brilliancy that almost supplies end its place.   Atan early hour in the evening, Aiia Surmt stole away from the family tir- le, and- tiowiag a ight shawl about her gacefu form, she glided of ih the starlight to the pine grove by the ide -of theite lakeinthe rear of the house Here on a rusti seat, close bythe shore where the rippling billows almost kis- ed her tiny feet, she threw herself and gazed, dreamily out upon the silvery looking water. She Lad been there but a few mo- ,ments, when the sound of a rapid step -coming from the direction of the house fell upon her ear. For a moment her cheek paled, and she gazed back in xervous anxiety, but the color returned to her cheek when she reeonizled the form of her lover, - John Wilkes Booth, advancing to her  ,side. "I am so glad you have come!" she x said, in a low tone, as she reached out  her hand. - I wanted so much to talk to v you, and Icould not at the houe, with all them to listen to our conversation. ] What do you inten  to do now? Noth- a ing, I hope, which will again place your life or your liberty in danger." "I know not what to do, my dear Anna," said Booth. "The South will now secede-peacefully, if it can; but if not, the war must come.  General A Davis looks for and is prepared for war. a If it comes he offers me a commission h in the Southern Army."  "Oh do not take it. If you go South, you are lost to me forever. For my father never will leave this plantation without he is driven from it, and I must stay where he stays-until -until- ' "Until when dearest?"  And Booth spoke in a low and tender I tone as he asked the question, passing la his arm around the slender waist of the beautiful girl.          in "Until taken from him by some one hi who has a better right to my love and cr duty!" said Anna in a whisper, a pa roseate blush suffusing her face. ti    I undlermtand you my dear girl," said Booth in a mel'ahoey toee.. ", Bt if it a war should burt forth upon theeoth- e try, a wif will be the worst encum- e brance that a soldier can have. Hean 1. hardly dt his duty to his country and r remain atherideth protect her." - "Why need you be a soldier?" urged I the girl, pleadingly. "You are not y poor. You haves profession in which you have few equals,and you have your- - self told me more than once, that with P your father' fame before you and your own talent, you could at once take a first position on the English stage." And would you counsel me, Anna, to leave my country in herhour of peril?" "I would not, if a foreignfoe menaced her. I would unsex myself, and in * male disguise fight by your side in such a caser But oh, in these political quar- rels, when father will fighc against son, when brother will strike brother, why must you take a part?" "Sometimes, I think it is duty, then I think it is fate which drives me on. Shakespeare says "What fate imposes, man must needs abide; n It boots not to resist both wind and tide." "Oh do not think so-our fates go with our own will," said the lady. "Yourfavorite poet does not say so, Anna. I remember glancing at a pass* ago when you had the book in your hand a few days ago. It read some- thing like this, if I remember correctly. "Fate is above us all- We struggle, but what matters our endeavor  Our doom is gone beyond our own recall- May we de6iy or mitigate it?-Neverl" "You always beat me in an argument. You speak from your powerful mind. I only utter the thoughts of my weak, loving heart." "t It is almost a pity to have a heart in these troublous times," said Booth, his look and tone both sad. "It seems cruel to say it, but! have within the past few months regretted a thousand times, dear Anna, that we ever met.  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6976-00000027"/> w For before me I see nothing bright, and wiT I would not cast myshadows upon your no path."  "Do not speak so, Wilkes. What-  ever fate has in store for you, let me ar but share it, is all that I ask." th "All that is pleasant, I would share fl with you, dear Anna. But death and ad disgrace may be mine?" "Let death come first and I will leap th into its arms with you. I do notfear to th die," said the yonun girl,mournfalfl. at "All the happiness that I have ever known has been in loving you." Booth made no reply,but he tenderly pressed the small white hand which he held and gazed with a sad tondness down into her humid eyes. After a pause of several minutes, he said:  "I shall soon know what to do, dear al Anna. If the scheme upon which we a have now made a failure is not given ti up, I may have to remain at the North to carry it on. If that is the case, we h will not be separated."      v "But you will still be exposed to 3 danger. Oh, if you knew the sleepless n hours I have passed since this scheme i has been afoot-of the terrible dreams t which have made men sleep in wretch- edness, you would pity me." "I do, my dear Anna, I do from my  heart!" he replied earnestly. "You are  not fitted for trouble. If you had your i mother's iron will and stern, man-like character, you would not suffer so!" "Nor would I be capable of loving you as I do, dear Wilkes, were I like her. Let me have my troubles and my sorrows, but do not let me love you less." "Alas, Anna, I feel that I am but too unworthy of your pure unselfish love." ".1 do not think so, therefore you should not. But we will be missed from the house if we stay longer. Take me out to ride in the morning and we can talk all we wish without interrup- tion. for John will not come withus,   without I insist upon it, and I shall not." "It shall be as. you desire," said Booth, and rising, he offered her his arm and together they strolled back to the mansion, talking over plans for the future, in a low tone, as they moved along. Ah! how little of that future could they read! they would have trembled if they could have seen the darkness ahead. CHAPTER XXIV. ) But when men think they most in safety stand I  The greatest peril is at hand." DBAlTON. ". "WELL my brave friend,-we are here and safe!" said the President elect, r after their names had been registered e at Willard's and the President had re- I tired to his parlor. h " We are here, sir, thankheaven, and e have evaded the blood-thjrsty traitors who have conspired to destroy you. o But safety is a word which I dare not s use until I have seen you inaugurated e into office, and the power in your hands is to keep a guard of faithful men around i- you all the time." "I fear, Mr. Wilkins, that in your *y honest zealfor me and the country,you re msagrfy the danger in your own mind,"' ar said Mr. Lincoln, with a quiet smile. ke "Far from it, sir, very far from it!" replied the detective. "I have mingled ag with these men until I know the indi- ke vidual character and mental strength ny and designs of every one of them. Some ou of them are weak, vacillating and cow- ardly, others are strong-minded, mur- Ooo derous and desperate. Some will give B." up the moment you hold the reign of ou power. The -hate of others and their led determination to destroy you will last ike so long as they have life. If you pass we the Fourth of March unscathed, I hope ip- you will order the arrest and imprison- us, ment of every one of the conspirators."   "Upon whose evidence, my, good friend 1" "Mine of course, sir-,no one else knows them as 1 do." "And do you think, my good friend, that I would so render evil for the good you have done, as to allow you to ex- pose yourself to almost certain death by such a course? Yont have told me how extensive this organization is, and how powerful. Were the part which you have so well carried out once known to them, as it surely would be were any of its members arrested upon your testimony, you would be assassi- nated, and all my power would not be sufficient to protect you, without I had you incarcerated inca dungeon. And I scarcely feel like locking you dp. No- no-I will disarm these fellows and let them go!" "Disarm them, sir? How can you do that i" "By kindness and quiet magnanim- ity, my good friend. I will let the lead- ers know that I am aware of their in- tended wickedness, and that I pity and I forgive them." The detective shook his head gloom- ily. "Bad and desperate men never feel kindness!" he said after a moment's thought. "Harsh means alone will check them in their nefarious designs." "I disagree with you, and I must tell you a little story to illustrate my posi- tion," replied the kind-hearted Presi- dent. "In 1831, I was engaged in flat-boat- ing on the Mississippi River. In our crew we had a man who was about as cross-grained as a crooked apple-tree  and as ugly as a hungry bull-dog. He  was a large, powerful man, hadc the reputation of a fighting man and kept everybody around in fear of him. Nobody liked him, but he was necessary on our trip, for he was the best pilot on i the river and we could not run without  him. He seemed to have a spite against   i me from the moment he came on board the flat. It wasn't my beauty that e angered him, for I wasn't a bit hand- somer then than I am now." 1  And the President looked at himself I in the full length mirror opposite his -seat and laughed heartily as he did so. T hen he continued. "This man, Paytonwashis name, kept l up a constant growl at me whenever I was near him, and at last when I was uttering some little joke or other, he threw a pint cup full of whiskey in my face. Now in those days I had rather a quick temper and I had no liking for whiskey administered in that manner. I riled up, as the hoosiers say, and big as he was, pitched into him. The whiskey in my eyes made me smart in more than one sense, and before Mr. Peyton had fairly gathered himself up for a skrimmage, he was swallowing several of his teeth, had an awful pair of black eyes, and as I knocked him from a high platform where he was standing, he fell into the hold with an arm^so double, under-him, that it was broken by his weight as he fell. He was a thoroughly used up, man and it was all done before my eyes had got over smarting from the effects of the whiskey. "He swere the most terrible ven- geance. The captain of the flat and all hands advised me to leave before he got well. "But that was not my style. I had been brought up a near neighbor to a doctor and used often to help him in little jobs, and so I learned something of his trade. I went to work and set poor Peyton's arm, gave him a good dose of laudanum to make him sleep, got leeches and drew the blood from under his eyes and did all that I could to make him comfortable. And from there clear down to New Orleans I nursed and waited upon him as if he had been a brother. He was terribly ugly at first; but I didn't mind that,'and  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6976-00000028"/> when he began to see how much good I was doing him, his nature began to change. .By the time we got down to the Crescent City he was almost well, and s better friend or a kinder man in everyway I never saw than he was after that. Now it was not in the threshing I gave him which conquered that man and drove the desperado out of him-it was my rindnessa afterwards. Kindness goes a great ways, my dear sir, in training men as well as brutes. If you want to break a young horse, use him gently and do not let him feel the whip or spur, and you'll have him moving off under you as contented as a sucking baby in less than no time." "Your story is interesting, Mr. Lin- coin, and somewhat apropos, I ac- knowledge," said Wilkins. "But were I in your place I should put these Knights of the Golden Circle where day- light woul4 be scarce. Treason to the country and your injury is their whole aim." "The treason they must beware of, for that I will not forgive. But their personal-malice against me I care little for!" replied the great and good man. A servant entered at this moment and handed Mr. Lincoln a Dote. He opened and read it, and as he did so a genial smile lighted ufhis massive face and made it look almost handsome; it was an expression of the goodness in his noble heart. -"This note is from that gallant old hero, General Scott!" said he, as he glanced again over its contents. "A Virginian-where will he be if a struggle comes between the North and South?" said Wilkins, whose late ex- cerience had made him distrustful of every Southern man. "He will be found in the front rank of the Nation's Defenders!" said Mr Lincoln, warmly. "If he is a Virginian I too amu a Kentuckian. His past glo rious record is a surety for his honora   ile future. He has too long and too nobty ustained the honor of the old flag to desert it at the beck of a few hungry and disappointed poiticiana. He apologizes in this note for not call- ing upon me at once-he is severely afflicted with rhe pmtism, but will try  to call later in the day. I will save him the trouble, for I will go to see him." And the brave, single-hearted man, without a guard, in a city filled with his enemies, went out unattended, to call upon the first soldier of the Repub- lie and to confer with him upon the future of the Nation. CHAPTER XXV. -. I lefthim in a green old age, And, looking like the oak, worn, but still stedy Amidst the elements, while younger trees Fell fat around him." BYarN'a Wamma GENERAL WNFIELD SCOTT, the hero of Lundy's Lane and a thousand other fields, the soldier of more than half a century of stern experience, was sitting in his easy chair, while an attendant was bathing his swollen limbs with powerful lotions. His pale cheek, close compressed lips, and the swollen veins in his temples and an involuntary clutching together of his fingers, told how much he suffered, but he uttered no word of complaint; not a moan es- caped his lips. 1i 4Hurry up, my good Ifellow-hurry up!" he said; but there was no impa- tience in his tone. "I must be got in order to take a ride beforetwo o'clock!" "A gentleman is at the door, General, - who asks for an interview!" said an f orderly, coming into the room and standing in position, at a salute. "His name?" asked the General, re-  turning the salute. 1  "Mr. Lincoln, of Illinois, General!" ). returned the soldier. "Gracious Heavens! and he has made   the first call. Do not keep hin waiting a moment, my man; bring him right up here. Edward, put on my slippers and hand me my cane. I must rise to meet such a man if it half-kills me," cried the old hero. But he had not time to put himself to the extra sufferig; for before the atten- dant could bring the cane, the heavy step of Mr. Lincoln was heard and a moment after he entered the room, his aoul beaming out of every lineament in his honest face. "My dear General, I am very glad to see you, but sorry not to find you on your pins!'" said the President, as he advanced and shook the old hereby the hand heartily. "You have taken me completely by suprise, Mr. Presiden," said the Gen- eral. "I was getting rubbed down in hopes of being limber enough to call upon you!" replied the General. ' I must apologize to you for my delay." "No apology is necessary, my dear General!" said Mr. Lincoln. "A sol- dier with your reputation has no need of legs. But you were rather unkind at Cerro Gordo when you took Santa Anna's game leg and his carriage too." "Oh, he was mulsih, and I Yet him have his own way so far as riding was concerned," said the General, laughing in spite of the twinges of pain which occasionally convulsed his counten- ance. "How do things look here in the city, General V" asked Mr. Lincoln, taking  the chair which the attendant brought forward for him and crossing one of his  lengthy legs over the others  "Dark, Mr. Lincoln, very dark!" re-  plied the General. "Treason is openly  uttered in the streets-many of the best officers in the army ase sending in their resignations, and I hardly know who to trust." "There is ONE in whom we may im- I plicitly trust, who will never see de- t   truction come upon the-land of Wasli- p ington," said the President, in a solemn I tone, pointing upward. "Yes-I understand you, sir," re- plied the General. "And I pray to HM every day that I may never live to see the disunion occur which traitors now threaten." "It will not occur in your life-time or mine. There is too much hemp growing in this country for treason to prosper," said the President, with a quiet smile., "I do not know much about hemp- Andrew Jackson was great on the use of that. But when it comes to powder, lead and cold steel, I feel at home. I wish I had more oi it in this city just now; but the present administration has weakened me in every way it could." Never mind, General, the new one will do all that it can to strengthen you. I hope we shall get along with these traitors without need of military coer- cion. But if net, they shall feel that I am heavy handed." "I only wish, Mr. President, that my legs were twenty or thirty  years younger. My heart is sound enough, but age and hardship tell sad tales of my body." "All that we shall want is your head and your heart,.General," said Mr. Lincoln. "Your name has more terror in it for a traitor foe than a thousand swnrds in common hands. These dis- union men men threaten loudly, but for even that they are the less to be feared' Your truly brave or desperate man speaks through his deeds rather than his words. Shakespeare, whose writ- ings prove him to be the best delineator of characters that ever lived, says: "Who knows himself a braggart, Let him fear this-for it will come to pass That every braggart shall be found an ass." The General smiled and asked thee President if he would not permit him to order some refreshments.  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6976-00000029"/> Mr. Lincoln declined the offer with  thanks and said, that he merely came a around to have a friendly chat with the I General, and if it was not annoying he a should frequently drop in, in a familiar  way,to advise him.        I "I shall only feel too highly honored  by such confidence, Mr. President," said the veteran soldier, as he grasped the large hand of the patriotic states- man. "And sir, you may rest assured  of my fidelity, and if the worst comes to the worst, Iwill take the field if I have to do it on crutches." "I know you will, General, and that 1 reminds me of a little story of the.  Black Hawk War, which I will tell you. I was captain of an Illinois Volunteer Company in that little affair; not much  of a captain, I acknowledge, but I wore the uniform and knew enough to keep my boys in line without backing them up against a board fence. I had a neighbor, one John Hanks, who swore he'd go if I went, if it cost him a flock of sheep. The only objection was that he had been hurt at a logging bee and was so lame that he could scarcely crawl. He applied for a place in my company, but I told him it was no go- he was unfit for military service." "I'll be cussed if I don't make it a go!" said he; and that was the last I saw of him in Menard County at that time, for I marched in a day or two after for Rock Island on the Mississippi. On the very evening after I got there, when the whole command was drawn up for dress parade, who should I see but John Hanks, mounted on a shaggy Kaskaskia pony, with a' sword by his side longer than he was, a pair of old horse pistols in .his belt, and a rifle on his shoulder that looked old enough to have been used in 1776. 'Look ye here, Cap'n', he cried, as he drew up on the left ofthe company, I said I'd nake a go of it and cuss me if I'm not on hand. If you want myBetsy in your hair, you just offer to send me back. As I   ;JnlUlaVJza. didn't want his Betsy in my hair, for she weighed full two hundred, and never cut her finger nails, Ilet him stay; and as my commissary was homesick I sent him back and put John in his place. We didn't have much fighting, and John did as much duty as any of us. But, General, I have to go to work on my inaugural address and some other papers, so I must make my visit short." And the President rose to go. "GOD bless and help you, Mr. Lin- coln!" said the old veteran, trying to rise, a movement which the President promptly prevented. "Thank you, General-thank you! I have need of GoD's blessing in the stormy work before me and I will try to deserve it." And in another moment the geneal was alone. CHAPTER XXVI. "Then shook the hills with thunder riven, Then rushed the steeds to battle driven, And, louder than the bolts of heaven, Far flashed the red artillery." CAMPMBM1 THE Fourth of March, 1861, had come and passed. Abraham Lincoln, the Man of the People, had been inaugu- rated into the office to which he had been elected. And the low mutterings of the Southern Secessionists and their miserable Northern sympathisers had grown louder and louder, and the black cloud of treason was overshadowing all the Southern sky. At last it belched forth its first flash of lightning-its first peal of deep- mouthed thunder. On the 14th of April that thunder rolled over brave Ander- son'. head at Fort Sumter, and the storm which for four long years was to rage over that sunny South, toc carry desolation over its prolific plains, to drench its luxuriant soil with northern and southern blood, was opened. Sumter fell; the battles of Big Bethel, ,    Phillipi and Bull Ran told how well prepared the traitors had been for the war which they inaugurated, and that they must be crushed, or the Union lost. Oh, who will ever forget how our true patriots rushed to the field at the call of the President! No bounties were needed or taken then. Our best and our bravest; our truest and noblest, from the forum and the work-shop; from the homes of wealth and the cot- tagesofthe humble; on-on they rushed to be the first to save their native land, and too-too many of those to be the first to perish at traitor hands. Baker, Greble, IEllsworth, Vosburg, where are you  A Nation's gratitude 1 to her first defenders keeps your memo- I ries green., But it is not for me in this story to 1 follow the red path of war. A darker I track is mine-that of the base assassins  and their co-conspirators, who tried in 1 vain to destroy the Union which they  could not crush, by the murder of its d chosen chiefs.           d And that track I will follow until f every wretch connected with the das-  tardly plot has followed Booth to hell, a or is hung high upon the gallows of r; public execration. No one, North or t] South, whom my means of information brings within the criminal dock, shall v escape-be his place high or low.  ei With these brief remarks, I will close ri this chapter, to open it where the once m baffled conspirators re-unite in their pi accursed bond of blood, preparatory to vi the execution of that deed which has ai convulsed -tis nation with grief and so filled a w orld with horror.    he CHAPTER XXVII.       w "Smile on, nor venture to unmasl cc Man'sheart, and view the hell that's there."  de BYBOx se THE first four troublous years of th Abraham Lincoln's term of Presidential cl office had passed, and triumphantly mt re-elected by the vast majority of the St.   ell people of all parties whose sole prin- he ciple was hatred to treason and love at for the Union,he stood again before the at. gaze of thousands, withuncovered head ar and reverent heart, to take his oath of he office, to sustain and preserve the es Nation which had placed him at its st helm. t,  Friends, devoted friends, were circled ;; allabout him while the ceremony of t- re-inaugurationtookplace, and enemies d were there, close, all to--close to him. e One, with dark and glowering eyes, e his hand clenched upon the hilt ofa dagger which was concealed in  V, bosom, even gained the platform whire e the noble statesman stood when he de- - livered his brief, but noble, inaugural address. Yes, there at that hour stood the very man who by his murderous r hand afterwards wrung the true hearts of the whole nation with grief. John Wilkes Booth, with hate in his soul and r murder in his heart, stood there, but dared not strike then in the light of day, when he knew that the bullets I from more than a hundred musketa would pierce his base body, if at such a time and place had he but dared to ' raise a hand against the chosen man of the people. On this day, as upon the same anni- versary four years before, many of the enemies of the Government hoped to see riot and trouble, for threats had been made by home traitors and dissapointed partisans. But they were doomed to vain, regretful disappointment. Not an act, look or a word to mar the solemnity of the occasion was seen or heard. And when all was over, the vast crowd which had assembled to witness the ceremony and to hear what the Presi- dent had to say, dispersed to their several places of abode, the most of them rejoicing that in spite of the war- cloud still hovering over the land, the man who had so far kept the Ship of State on its true course, was still in  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6976-00000030"/> corowmn4d, with the haven of peace looting up before him, BtU others th e were, and they a portion. of the actors in this life tragedy of ours, who went away with their hearts filled with hate and gloom, went away to; renew their revengful vows and to plot a destruction which so far they had been unable to accom- plish. In a genteel house on one of the streets not far. from Pennsylvania Avenue,'in Washington, on the evening of that day, there was held a meeting which must be noted with the other facts in our history of life. At first there were but two persons present, and they sat together at a table upon which a bottle, with a tray of glasses and an open box of cigars was placed,  One of these persons was John Wilkes Booth; the other was a large, muscu- lar-looking ihan, heavily built, with a dark and savage-looking face, whom we Bow introduce for the first time to the reader. "' Take some of that Bourbon, Payne; it comes from your own State, and you ought to like it " said Booth, passing the bottle to his companion. "It likes me a cursed sight better than I like it. But here's a go, if it chokes me!" said Payne, as he filled a tumbler half full of the amber-colored fluid aud drank it off without pausing to dilute it, though the water-pitcher was within his reach. "It is time some of the rest of the boys were here," said Booth, looking at his watch, and then helping himself to a small modicum of the whiskey. "I saw Mrs. Surrat at the inauguration. She looked as if she would not have stood as quiet as I did, when well armed. I was within ten feet of ' old Abe' on the stand. She is a bitter woman when she sets her heart on a thing." "4Heart!" said Pyne with a sneer. "A woman who could put a husband   out of--but I forgot; you told my never to speak of that again." "Yes, Payne, yes-I wish you would never allude to it. Her husband was always lukewarmin the cause and began to bedangerou. He had a conensoe, and had got sofar as to regret what he had already done, and we knew not when he might, in his fears for his own safety, betray our plans and ourselves- No matter how he was got rid of, it wae well for us when he went to a better or aworse world. And the less we say about it the better for all concerned. She is a smart woman, strong-willed, good at planning, as well as executing, extensively acquainted with the class of people we must use, and in her way invaluable to us." "Well, you know best. There is a step on the stairs--I wonder who comes,'" replied Payne. " The step is quick and light-I should not wonder if it proves to be Harold," said Booth. "A boy-you trust too much to the little fool," said Payne, with a frown on his heavy brow. "He is faithful-the fellow would die for me!" said Booth, as he opened the door to a peculiar knock, known only to the initiated. Ah, it is you, Harold, we knew your step. You come in as light as a danc- ing-master," said Booth, as he welcomed the same boyish-looking young man whom wemet once before in Baltimore, and who was sent by Davis as a spy to Springfield. "Yes, it is me. Why didn't you shoot to-day, when you had so good a target close to you?" "Shoot, when I would have been a target myself to five hundred muskets in a second afterwards " said Booth with a laugh. "No, my dear boy-I think rather too much of number one for that. When I shoot, I will have means to escape ready to carry me to my Southern friends. I do not intend,   if I make a martyr, to become one my- self. I am youngyet, and life is worth holding on to." "There is where you and I differ, Mr. Booth," said Payne, taking another /ight dose from the bottle; "I never loved life, and yet it seems as if I'd never have the luck to lose it. I've been in some-of the most cursed tight places out West that ever a devilish fool got into, and I've come out safe every time, while more than one chap has left the ground red that I walked over." "Fortune may not always so favor. you. Ours now is a desperate venture, andi we fail, death is as certain as that we are now  sitting together here."              * "We may die in the work, but we will notfail. Young as I am, I have had a good many jobs laid out for me, and I never failed in one of them yet," said Payne. "I am glad to hear you say so. My friends, Thompson, Sauiners  andi Cleary, gave me just such an account of you when they named you as an as- sistant in the business," said Booth. "Clem Clay knew me a devilish sight better than either of the ones you have named," said Payne, quietly. "Old Thompson only knew me through Clay, I and I only knew him because I had Jeffs order on him for funds when I needed them, and I used to make at pretty often call on him for spondulicksi when I was in Csnada." "I troubled Thompson some in that  line myself when I was over the bor- ders," said Booth. "But now i send to the fountain head for myfunds. John 1 Surrat is at Richmond for money and i orders at this very time, but he will soon be back. I sent for gold thistime,  for if Grant makes a move when Sher- man gets well up toward Richmond, the seat of Government will have to be  moved, and I've an idea that the gold I in the banks and Confederate treasury a   'will have to move too. Therefore I L mean to get all that I can before there isabreakup." "Do you anticipate a break up ', asked Harold, as he tried to twist his incipient moustache. "Not if we do our duty," said Booth. "As President Davis said to me in his last letter, all depends upon the chosen fewwho are selected to carry out his' plans at the North. There arethe Can- ada gang,the Philadelphia andNew York Circle and our own party, each with different work to do, all tending to the same point, who are worth more to him ,than his armies, and he knows it. Now that he finds he can get no open recog- nition from abroad, and his own re- t sources are narrowed down to next to nothing, he cannot stand the army pres- sure much longer. But if we strike down all the Northernleaders, kill some of the best Union Generals and burn up half a dozen or more of the biggest I cities, the Northerners will be glad to curse us and to let us go." "Well, you and Mr. Davis know all about you policy and your politics," said Payne, with a coarse laugh. "I care nothing about such things. Lay my work out, pay me well, and I'll do it. There's where I stand. I never voted in my life, but I've Inockled some voting blind on election days when soap was to be made by the operation." "That's the ticket, and here's the kind of soap that ' Golden Knights' like to look at," cried a young man who had noiselessly opened the door and come in unobserved by the party. And he threw a heavy bag upon the table, which he had drawn from an inside pocket of his grey overcoat. He was a tall, slender young man, with a light beard and moustache, and his hair hanging long about his neck. - What, Surrat, so soon back? Have you been through to Richmond?" cried Booth, as he rose and grasped the new aomer by the hand.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6976-00000031"/> "Yes, that bag of gold, didn't come the from Uncle Sam's treasury. Uncle Jeff go forked that over to your humble come r tumble, and there is a fresh batch of 1 orders for you and our friends across il the borders."           rat And Surrat threw down a package of  papers by the side of the gold. fee ' How did you get through so quick? ' You have only been gone five days. I ha did not expect you for a week."  er "Oh, Moseby had the line in order W this time. I rode my first horse down to G Mudd'#, got a fresh one there, and went H to thecrossing. Moseby had a boat m there, and when I got over he had fresh a horses and an escorevery twenty miles, 1I and I went to Richmond before I slept, na eating in the saddle, and old Jeff hur- th ried me back, for he says we've got to 01 hurry up or he and the whole Confed- de eracy go up in spite of fate. Hisletters s will tell you all, I expect. He told me w not to delay a moment until they were t your hands. He sent that bag of if goland a few thousands in greenbacks  hat he got from Moseby and an order on Thompson for more, for Grant is t closing up so around Richmond that we  can't risk getting more from that di-  rection. And Ican tell you, old fel, 'm not going to risk another such a jour- ney inthat direction. r'l go to Csava a for you, but the road to Richmond and  hell are too much alike to suit a man of my early piety. What have you good totake here?" "A cure for all ills,!" said Payne with a laugh, as he handed Surrat the bot- tie. "It is the oil ot Bourbon, to be taken inwardly whenever you can get it. That's my motto. My mother used to give it to me instead of milk; that's what made me grow so." Surrat poured out a glass and drank it off-an action immediately followed by Payne. Harold, in a namby-pambyish tone, said he wouldn't indulge on that occa- sion. He was in a course of study for   rus J UiD. -3. the anti-teiAptatioB cause and couldn't go anythingweaker than lemorpad with a red stick in it. Booth, meantime, ws deeply engaged in the perusal of the letters which Sur- rat had brought. At last, he cried, as he sprang to his feet. "The die is cast-the time for action has come, boys, and we cantalk no long- er. Our forces must all be got together. Within three weeks, Lincoln, Seward, Grant, if he can be got here, Stanton, Halleck and all the rest on our list, must be got rid of. There is tobe another burning plot which will follow up our work, and it will carry conster- nation through the land. Davis says the greatest iron-clad ever built will be on the coast in a week to knock the devil out of the Yankee ships, and to shell New York and Boston, a ship that will no more mind theirforts than we do ) the popping of cihmpagne corks. She f is called the ' StoDewaU,' but she is a mountain of iron." r   "Good! He talks like work. I like s to hear that," said Payne, as a look of e savage pleasure lighted up his gladato- - rialface. n  *( We will have enough of it within a - sho rime," said Booth. Harold, you a an. Surrat must look to our horse ar- d rangements, for I must leave Washing- Af Non in ten minutes after my blow is d truck. Mine is the'most risky and taring of all the work before us-Payne ;h hasthe nexthardest job. Atzerot has a t- tough job,too, but I think our plans are oe so laid that there can be no failure. et We will all meet here to-morrow and ad make the final arrangements. And you, Vs Surrat, by the day after, must be ready ro start for Canada with these other Ik dispatches, leaving one, a very impor- ed tant one, in Philadelphia." "I'm always ready for Canada," said le, Surrat, gaily. "I never feel so safe as :a- I do when I get under the paws of the for good-natured old English lion. And   they tve, at the Saint Lawrence, you'd better believe. There's no corn-dodgers and hog there, and "that's all a fellow can get in Richmond for love or money. Ten dollars a drink there for whiskey, and nary a cracker thrown in, tells on a young man with pious habits and a slender income, I can tell you." "Well, boys, you must excuse me to- night. I have writing to do which will keep me at work until daylight. Come here to-morrow night, early. Allhands will be notified," said Booth. Three minutes afterwards he  was alone. CHAPTER XXVIII. "I sue, and sue in vain; it is most just; When women sue, thy sue to be denied." YounG. NOTlong was Mr. Booth alone. He had emptied the bag of gold upon the table, and as he stood gazing at the glit- tering coins, he muttered to himself; "Will this gold gild my path to ieav- en, or pave it down to hell? Judas took silver, played traitor and hung himself; Arnold took gold, was too cowardly to hang or shoot himself when he failed, and found a life-time of misery, or else historians lie. But for all that gold is power. Pope was a moralist. Preach- ers quote him in half the sermons they write. Aand yet he said:  "Get place and wealth, if possible, with grace, If not ,by any means get wealth and place." That ismy motto. If I succeedin this desperate venture, then farewell to my past life. Othello's occupation will be gone. Yes "Farewell the stage, the poor degraded stage, Which holds its mirror to a gaping age; There, where to raise the Drama's moral tone, Fool Harlequin usurps Apollo's throne." A light knock at his door caused the young actor to suddenly pause in his soliloquy. He hadnot heard a footstep, and he knew not who was there at that late hour. Had he spoken loud enough to be heard outside, he asked himself,   while his brow paled and his cheek flushed. He hurriedly threw some newspapers over the money which lay loose on the table and then went and opened the door. A veiled female, slight of form and graceful in figure, stood before him. She spoke and he instantly recognized her voice and taking her by the hand led. her into the room. "You here, Anna, at this hour?" he asked in a sad and almost reproachful tone. "Yes, Wilkes," she replied in a tone of melancholy tenderness, "I could not stay away. John has come back from Richmond, and from a hint offered by him I know that you are going to put your life in peril and to go on with the desperate undertaking which others have led you into, who dare not take the risk upon themselves. I love you; my life is centredinyour life; your dan- ger is my danger. Tell me all-and if you will not listen to my prayer, my pleadings, and give up this terrible ad- venture, then I will share all the dan- ger, and if you die, die with you." "Anna, dearest, your fond heart magi nifies my peril. I am not in danger." "OhWilkes, you cannot deceive a loving heart. I know and I feel your peril.. And only love makes me so will- ing to brave it all for your sake. If you loved as I love, you would cast it all aside and leave this-distracted coun- try forever. You know the agony racks my poor heart. This thing has already cost me a dear, dear father. It will cost me a mother, who though stern and harsh sometimes, isyet my mother. And if you-you too are to be lost, what have I to live for? nothing-nothing!" And the beautiful' girl bowed her head upon her white hands and wept- sobbed bitterly. "Annie, do not grieve so-you almost unman me!" said Booth, as he raised her head and pressed a kind kiss upon  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6976-00000032"/> uv he white brow. "I love you better than life-better than everythinghut my honor and my country. I have sworn to give my life to my country, if it is necessary. But our plans will succeed, and snccess will. make me great. Fail- are only makes men villians. It ismis- fortune, not guilt, which makes crimi- nali now-a-days." "Ah Wilkes-all your arguements are specious, but you do not believe them yourself. I know you do not. To try and cheer me you say that there is sunshine, where with the eye of your soul you see nothing but clouds and darkless." "No-no, Annie. You know I would not deceive you, of all other personsin the world. And now will you not do me a great favor 1" "Anything, dear Wilkes,which in the purity and honor of a fondbut innocent girl, I can do." "' It is a simple favor, Annie. On the day after to-morrow your brother will goto Canada upon a mission for the Circle. I want youto gowith him, and to wait there until I come." "And leave yosjthere to face your perils all alone?" "Yes-for you cannot aid me." "Oh, Wilkes, you do. not know what woman can do. If you persist in what I know your mind is bent upon, and should be afterwards taken, my prayers might save your life. Or, if they failed, my wit might contrive your escape, and my courage Aid you in it. You smile, but I am braver than you think. I did not fear to walk the streets of this wicked city at this midnight hour. See. I am armed." And the lovely girl drew a small re volver from her pocket. Booth smiled, and as he again kisded her white forehead, he said: "You are indeed a brave, good girl Annie, and I regret that your love has been bestowed on one so unworthy as I. You must let me escort you home now,   and we wh talk a we go. I must has- ten, for I have writing to do which must be finished before day dawns." The lady said no more, but when he was ready, took his arm and went out. CHAPTER XXIX. "And many an old man's sigh, and many a widow's, And many an orphan's water-standing eye; Men for their sons, wives or their husbands' fate, And orphans for their parents' timeless death; Shallrue the hour that ever thou wast born." Scjlanllw IN a private parlor of the Executive Mansion, in the Rebel Capital of the "so-called"Confederate States, which once existed, but now are among the things that were, our next scene is laid. The hour was late, for only the sound of the patrols riding to and fro along the streets could be heard near at hand; though, like sharp, heavy thunder, the 'ound of the besieging cannon could be heard every few minutes from the lines which were drawing closer and closer, stronger and stronger about the doomed city. In the parlor were four persons only. Giving the prominence, which Satan's chiefest aids always deserve, we will first look at the leader in the Rebellion which has drenched our fair land with blood, and filled millions of hearts with grief. Seated at around table, with a huge pile of papers; official-looking docnment-- before him, was Jefferson Davis his face, not ruddy and full, as it once was 'before crime seared his soul and danring his brow, but pale, his brow wrinkled, his features contracted, his whole frame ner- vous and miserable. Next to him was seated another disap- pointed politician, another traitor to the country which had nursed him into early grestneas  His name  too, is enrolled upon the scroll of immortal shame, reckenridge. Next to him, grown prematurely old,   at the man whose name had been placed to the commia ons of tho Pirtea  who Skulked over the ocean, robbing and d*froytBg or vnsr"me merchrmnnum,but avoiding, likeinfernal cowards, straitors ever are, the pursuit of armed vesels les fohmidable than themselves, knowiig well the fate of pirates should they meet those who were deputed to pulsh their treason and their crime The fourth person, and the last of the diabolic quartett, was Reagan, the most faithfal of all of the adherent of Davis: who, having with hip, hld by anest fall of golden eggs for the ftture in a foreign landy meant "to see him through," in weal or in woe "Genitlemen," aid Davis, looking over a dispatch which he had just raised from the table, I have called you to my side to- night for eontltUatio-n We arein a tight plac, and unless fortune changes greatly, within less than forty-eight hours, the days of this goverrmient are numnbered. Grant has been reinforced to such a strength that at any moment if he chooses he can walk right through and over our defences. This Lee distinctively says. Galveston is the only seaport left to us, and that is useless to this part of the Cofedercy while the Mississippi is in the hands of the enemy. "That crack-brained devil, Sherman, is sweeping up through the Carolinas like an avalanche, just as he moved over Georgia, evidently intending to cut off our last line of retreat. That young devil, Sheridan, with his wild riders, goes where he pleases, and we are cooped up here like wild- beasts, encircled by fire. The people, whose patriotism shrinks with the empti- ness of their bellies, are grumbling all the time, and nowhere do I find the r'pport which once I could  command. Lee is disheartened; he begins to talk of avoid- ing unnecessary bloodshed-unnecessary  mind you, as if the lines of a few thou. sand ragged and growling soldiers were worth a second thought, and hints at a E surrender of the army on honorable terms, z Il   iwhchb he ss he can get before the enemey know how weak weare a H might get terms, whilewith rms ix his hands he stands at bay-but where will be the terms for uA For m, for you, too, gentle men, the terms of mery would be time enough to say our prayers, and then a knotted rope and a deep grave." "Would not Lincoln allow us to leave the country, if you agreed to issue a proclamation, that proclamation embo- dying a surrender of all power to the strength which we cannot withstand 7" asked Reagan. "You know, Mr. Presi- dent, that I have shippedaboard funds enough to support us all in princely style among our English friends." "May my right hand wither before I sign such aproclamation." said Davis, bitterly. "If we mUst go, we will go, not by Abraham Lincoln's permission, but without it. But if my plans are carned out, he and Ins renegade partner in office will soon be where their per- mission will be as useless, and their or- ders as weak as those which are spoken from the lips of a marble statue. I hope the days of tt man are nearly at an end. He andilWof his cabinet are doomed men. He stands over a mine, which a sparl gnay explode. If my agents do their. work well, there is yet hope for the Confederacy. /f Lincoln, Seward, Stanton, Grant, Halleck and three or four more of their leading men are stricken down, if then, Philadelphia and Harrisburg are laid in ashes, and simultaneously with these disasters, the invulnerable marine monster 'Stone- wall' shells New York and Boston, and  sinks a tenth of their Navy, for nothing can withstand her terrible battery, and yet more terrible beak, a panic will en- sue. Lee can break away from a panic stricken enemy, invade the North once more, and then-thy  we can have peace upon our own terms. England, France and Austria only wait to see such a series of terrible successes, to acknowledge and to aid us."  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6976-00000033"/> "Precious kind it will be in them to aknowledge us and offer aid when we no longer require it!" said Mallory, brushing back the bushy hair from his wrinkled forehead. "Better late than never," said Rea- gan, while he tried to smile. "When do you expect your agents to begin this work I Every hour is like a year to us now!" said Breckenridge. "Each hour I expect news that they are at work. Their orders have reached them long ago. They are well supplied with money. We have ardent friends in every Northern city to aid them in their designs, our men in Can- ada with two millions of gold at com- mand are not idle and I cannot see fail- ure in that part of the programme. If Lee will only holl out till we hear from them, the Confederacy is safe yet." "You have not told him of your assassination and burning, have you V" asked Breckenridge. "No, no, indeed. His indignant re- pudiation of our plan to starve and de- stroy all the prisoners we took, without actually committing open murder, showed that he was not yet to be en- trusted with such a secret. He is too much of a stickler for the honor of a soldier, to suit me.. What has honor to do in a case like ours? We are in a fix, far too desperate to pause upon mere points of honor. Lee must hold out for ten days more. I told him so in a dis- patch to-night." "In less than ten days Sheridan will cut our la t railroad and Sherman will be at the base of our south side in- trenchments," said Mallory. "Before he gets there, if we do not hear of a success in our Northern plans, we will be making our way to the coast, gentlemen, with full twelve millions of dollars in gold. Maffit, the hero of the Florida, is already hovering within signal distance of an unwatched point of debarkation,and I have kept Wheel- er and Hampton ready, within tele-   graph - call, to escort us away, if at last we have to fly."  "Unless your Northern agents do bet- ter than Bragg and Beauregard have, we will have to be on the move soon," said Breckenridge. "Well, gentlemen, if we must move, my preparations are complete. If the South must yield, we at least will not be victims. And once abroad, with money to buy up the press there, and to keep up incendiary agents still at work here, wecan, perhaps, yet involve the United States in a foreign war through which we can yet regain our rights. I shall never despair while we have life and money left. Nor will I rest. until the object of my life is accom- plished. Andnow,gentlemen, havingex- plained to you myviews and hopes, and knowing that you will stand by me to the last, we may as well retire, for I see. the small hours of morning are advanc- ing rapidly, and we all need rest!" The members of the midnight council were glad to accept this proposition, and in a minute more the room was vacant. CHAPTER XXX. "Patience I Preach it to the winds-- To roaring seas, or raging fires I The knaves That teach it, laugh at you, when you believe them." OTWAY. IT was the afternoon of another day. Booth was in his room alone, busy in writing and sealing letters. A light footstep approaching his door did not disturb him, he was so much engaged. But a quick nervous knock upon the door startled him, and springing to his feet he hurriedly concealed the letters which he had sealed and directed, and then went to the door and opened it. He was met face-to-face by Mrs. Sur- rat, the mother of the gentle and loving girl Who had come to him at such a late hour n the previous night. She did not 1 k1 nearly so young as she did when we last saw her at Cedar   Grove. Her dark grey eyes had a cold and stony look-her face was pale and colorless-the'features were more sharp and angular-her form did not seem so fall. "Do I disturb you, Mr. Booth?" she asked, as he opened the door. "Not in the least, my dear madam- 'not in the least. I am ever glad to see you. Pray come in and be seated," re- plied Booth. "Business, is my excuse!" said the lady, as she entered the room and took a chair. "My son brought me a private letter from Mr. Davis, which I thought you ought to see. He thinks you do not press matters with sufficient haste." "He must be patient, madam; he must be patient. Rome was not built in a day, nor was Carthage destroyed in a week." "Patience, Mr, Booth, patice, when death or utter subjugation stand black before him? Talk of patience to a man in his situation? His troopshalf starved and half-naked, despondent and mutin- ous! His victorious enemies gaining strength and new advantages every day. It is madness to talk to him of patience. He urges action-immediate and final action. He says that if you and your associates fail, the day of hope has gone for him and for the Confeder- acy. Can you speak of patience and see him and the fruits of all his labor perish Can you be recreant to the vows which bind him and you together in the same Brotherhood?" "No, madam, never. If I have been tardy, it has been the fault of Mr. Davis himself. I have not had the 'sinews of war' to work with. In brief, the tools which I am forced to use are dull and useless without I have gold to sharpen them with. That article your son brought last night, and I am now ready for action. To-night all my plans will be divulged to the men who are to act, and each will receive his final orders. Each blow in this city   will be struck at the same hour." "For yourself, you adhere to the plan you last divulged to me, do you not?" asked the lady.  ' Yes madam, in every particular: There will be no change in that." "Then I will go out to Surratville and beyond, and see that all is ready for you on the road. If you are bold and fortunate you will be in safety within a night's time after the deed is done. And where will John be?" "In Canada when the work goes on here. I promised you not to involve him in a work of blood, if it could pos- sibly be avoided. I have rougher men than he, who will not fail in their work, and I shall assign ajob to each of them. They are but assassins at best, hired bravos, and if they do their work I care not what becomes of them afterwards." "Would you like to see the letter which Mr. Davis wrote to me?" asked the lady. "As you please, madam-that is if there is no privacy in it!" was his reply. "None whatever. It only relates to the business of which we have been speaking." replied the lady, as she laid the letter before him. Booth took it up and read it. "The Confederacy is indeed in a pret- ty tight place," he said, as he laid the letter down. "But the Union will soon be in as tight a situation if the plans now afoot meet with success." "They must, Mr. Booth-they must. There must be no failure. To fail will bring, destruction upon ns all." "I know it madam, and I willsucceed or die. Perhaps even at the hour of success I shall fall, but if I do, my mem- ory will go down as one who loved the sunny South more than his own life. That at least will be a consolation. By the way, madam, will you do me a great favor?" "Anything in the bounds of possibil- ity which you can ask, Mr. Booth."  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6976-00000034"/> "Then do urge your daughter Annie to go to Canada with John to-morrow. She will be safe there and will not try to unnerve me with fears whenmy hour foi work approaches. I tried to per- suade her to go with him, but no argu- f ment of mine will now move her." Like me, Mr. Booth, she is obsti- ' nate when her mind is once made up. i But I will use my influence to have her I go. She can be ot no use to ushere and as you say she will be far more safe there than here. By the way,haveyou heard from Colonel Melville lately?" "The one who pretended to be Colo- nel Melville you mean. I have only just discovered that we were all taken in and completely fooled by him. There is a Colonel Melville in Louisi- ana, but a far different man from our olonel. The latter was neither more or less than a New York detective, and it was through his cunning that our frst plans were frustrated. But he is done for. Orders reached the New York Cir- cle some few days ago, which have disposed of him for a long time, perhaps forever. I hope so, for I never want him on my track again. I neverthought I should be or even couldbe deceived by a man. But he was too well made up, and too sharp altogether for me. Even his niggers were made up, and were white men blacked up." "It seems impossible, But I have been told that those detectives are cap- able of all kinds of disguises. When will you come to see us, Mr. Booth?" When all my plans are laid; the hour for work fixed, then I will come to tell you andto say farewell, for Heaven only knows when we will meet again. Mine is a desperate adventure, and I must fly fast and far from the revenge- ful hounds which with full cry will be put on my track. I will surely see you before I act." "Do, Mr. Booth. I will not interrupt you longer at present." And the lady retired. *   CHAPTEER XXXI. "H ow aw, you mset, black, an midnightSad., What s't you do?" IT was the night appointed by Booth for the meetingof al his associates who were destined to take an active part in the diabolical conspiraey which, plotted in Richmond, by the chiefs of the rebel- lion, was destined to convulse the whole Union with grief. In this room, at the hour of midnight, they were all gathered, having come in one by one at slightly different times. Payne, with his giantframe, and bold, murderous lboking face-Atzerot, with his brutish countenance, Harold, boyish asever-all of them, and yet others who were to take minor parts in the tragedy, were present. Booth, who was the only intellectual looking man of the entire lot, sat at the head of the long table in the room, with a package of papers in his hand, and a large pile of money in gold and United States greenbacks before him. There were bottles and glasses on the table and several of the party took an "occasional drop" to nerve them for the coming work. When all whom he expected had en- tered the room, Booth took up the package of papers, and handing one to each of his visitors, paid: ",Brothers-the hour for work has been fixed, and each of you has hispost and duty plainly laid down. In the secretcypher known to you all, you will find the most minute directions to govern your actions, plans, to pursue which will make your escapes safe andcertain, a list of friends who will aid you on the several routes which you must take. If success crowns our united efforts, we will soon all meet again in a triumphant South. If we fail-we will be as likely to meet in hell as anywhere else, for failure will be death to all who are taken. Remember that, and when you strike, strike home.

And nowremember, men, not ony your oaths as K]ightx of the Golden Cirole, but your duty as enlistedand commissioned members of the Sonthern army. Be firm,- be united and obey orders to the letter. President Davis looks upon us as his last hope. If we succeed, he trLiiph. If we- fail the cause of the Confederacy is lost." "I shall nbtiail"!said Payne, laying his brawny riglft arm out upon the table. "And If anmay man of this par does fanl through cowardice, he had bet- ter say" his last prayers before I meet him after my work is over, for I'd vUt his throat ifhe was my own brother." "I have no more fears for you than I have for myselt,. said Booth, as he  glanced approvingly at the bold face and athletic form of. the Southern des- perado. "And I too swear by my oath as a Knight of the G. C. to strike down  any one who proves recreant now at  this late hour, no matter where next I meet him." , "There will be no backing out on my part!" said ,tzerot, but his face was pale andhis hand shook nervous- ly while he spoke. "I hope and believe that no one will falter in this, our final work," said cc Booth, as he reached for a brandy bot- is tle and refreshed his own nerves with a y vigorous dose from it. "And now, to brothers, I wish each of you to carefully  read his orders over, sothat if there is aha point which you do not understand, I or can explain it to you. That done, I of will distribute the money which is ready see for you."             ta Each man now carefully examined  he paper which had been handed to po( m, and which detailed with minute- bin less the part he was to take in the I   rl-- w , li, meansp of ecape and the Wg  9nrte  d hvlchl u^  puxst . fo  9  -o0 6ti'.ns only were ased ow  ythe ow  ato, wch h ld- d iy answ  d    .d ,a t .. ti all state4d that r. they saw their whlan before them. en  Booth then dBitabute4 to each man id his proportion oOf tpe fund which had rn been sent to aid them in, and partially y ewasrd thenfor, the dastardly work of is bloo before them. re  This done le said: ie  "Brothers-we will meet no more n- til our work is oyer. The hour as you g know is set-though we work in differ- e at places, eagh blowmu ct be struck as y near as possible at the same moment. ; That will create such a general confu- t sion, that our chances of safe escape twill be greatly increased. We willnow separate, and without you receive fur- ther notice from me, act upon our own hooks and do the best we can. The more wekeep apart, the less will be the danger that anyof the prying detectives  will get wind of our designs. To your posts, every man, and keep ready for work. Sure aim, strong nerves and fearless hearts will do the work. Good night, all." "Good night," responded the- men and one by one they rose and departed until only the youth Harold was left. "You did not mean for me to go, did youT" asked the young man of Booth. "No-not just yet. You are to be my companion and my guide after my work is done. I have no heavier work for you. You are young yet and not used to blood, and I did not wish you to risk your hand in such heavy work as we have before us. We will take a glass or two of wine while Ilook over the map of Maryland and Virginia with you and see the precise route which we are to take." And Booth, as he said this, opened a pocket-map and spread it out before him. Pouring out a couple of glasses of  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6976-00000035"/> vv 'wine for himself and his young compan- B ion, he called the attention of the latter  to the map and questioned him closely h concerning 'the roads which" led from Washington in t e'direction he meant th to take in his proposed route of flight. to Harold was very ready with his re- a: plies, and seemed to know every rod fo of the proposed route, having traveled V over it often before the war, and three S or four times as a rebel messenger  afterward.  When fully-satisfied on that point,  Booth then explained minutely what he shoulddo, and where on the event- P ful night Harold wasto join him, giving  him a countersign by which he would be known in the darkness, and then they parted for the night.  And now John Wilkes Booth was alone. All of the desperate men who M had been chosen as his associates in the terrible work of death before him, had gone to arm for the crime, and he had but himself to commune with.  Wtas it a wonder that at that still 3 hour of the night he should look ner- vously around him and almost regret the departure of his last companion. He shuddered as some chilling thought croAs Wis mind, and then he drank a full glass of strong liquor to nerve him  to the task of writing letters to those whose future lives would be rendered wretched by his mad deed-his nearest relatives-letters which he knew would notreachthem until that deed was done. Leaving him thus to think upon his own uncertain future, and to impart his thoughts in that last desperate hour to those whom he should have loved and honored too much to so shadow their lives, we will move off into the excitement of another chapter. CHAPTER XX1i. *' The tyrannous and bloody act is done, The most arch deed ot piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of!" IT was night again-night over all the xand-night in the Capital of theNation.   KlUlAui;D. But the hour was yet early, and moving life was everrwhere, in the deepeningr- shadows and in the glaringllight. A large and fashionable audience filled the seats in the first theatre at Washing- ton. Not one half of that audience cared a jot about the play which was being per- formed , they went there to see two indi- viduals; the first Statesman and the first Soldier of our proud Republic. The Statesman with his care-laden heart-great generous heart-was there- there more to please the people whom he loved than to gratify his own desire for pleasure, but the Soldier, as fate willed it, was absent. Fate, I say, for it was nothing else kept the noble and heroic Grant away on that occasion. Laugh at me if you will; but I am a fatalist, a believer in destiny. Else why, why I ask, when I have shaken hands with death an hundred times and felt his chilly grasp like ice upon my saul, have Ibeen spared for " something" yet, perhaps to show the world I was not miade for uselessness? With Dryden, I cry: "A las! what stay is there in human state, Or who can shun inevitable . He? The doom was written, the decree was past t  Ere the foundations of the world were cast." The President, his wife, a young and a lovely maiden, and a gallant soldier, e were all seated in the banner-draped box, I little dreaming that the basilisk eye of an it assassin had been centered there. ad  e, the assassin, nerved by drink, for e. drink alone, not true courage, could is strengthen his arm and madden his brain rt for the murder,had made hispreparation ;e for flight-had seen his horse saddled an re led to the spot which he could esies Oo reach after the black deed was done, had Iff seen his associate and assistants all poste and now he only waited for the hour come when the others were to strike, finish his own part in theterrible tr edy.  Nine o'clock came and with a pali he face, an eye burning like fire, he could  Dn. seen moving about in the vestibule of th   theatre, now looking to see the precise -position of his intended victim, then ex- changing glances with some confederate, who, armed and ready, waited to aid his escape if he was interrupted In his flight, after his blow had been struck. Half past nine. The hour was approach- ing. More and more nervous, the asss- sin had to take drink afterdrink of fiery liquor to keep his heart from sinking. How could he look upon that good man with a Nation's care upon his breast,. sit ting by the side of his wife, and feel no terror, no remorse, no thought of the awful sin which his hand was about to commit? Ten, by the clock. The hour has almost come. Booth walks out, drinks once more from the maddening cup, goes to see where his impatient horse stands champing his bit.  Then he puts on his spurs, looks to his weapons for the last time, draws his hat i down over his burning brow and strides into the theatre. Once more he moves along the corridors, t once more notes with care the position of his r intended victim, once more glances at the I pale, eager faces of his confederates, who t look now to see whether he will indeed dare c the terrible work, or fail in the final hour. f They see in his white face, his glaringeye, A his compressed lips, but one thing-determi- t nation-mad determination. Another half d hour creeps slowly on. Then like a tiger t] creeping towards its intended prey, with a quick, stealthy step, when nearly every eye w is on the actors on the stage, he gains the rear of the box, fastens the door behind him, of draws the murderous pistol from its conceal- t ment and aims deliberately at the head of b his victim. Hell glares in his eye as he looks t over the deadly barrel-hell rages in his h heart as his finger presses the trigger. 1 He fires the shot; one wild shriek-it is a fie widow's cry of dispair is heard, then the t dark form of the assassin is seen as he leap] I from the box upon the stage with a knife in b his hand already stained with the blood of the th only brave man who sought to seize him-   p then he is gone as he shouts a cry meant for tyrants, not for patriots, gone out in the l   se darkness of the night, leaving death and a X- terrible scene of commotion behind him. ;e, In that one terrible minute he had brought is a grief upon this nation which no time will it, efface-wrought a horro;,which no words of mine can adequately express--a horror which L- went with lightning speed over the tele- s- graphic wires through every artery of the y nation. g.  What one of all my readers will forget n the nameless dread, the shuddering thought t- that came upon him orher when that news o first fell upon the ear? For myself, it seem- l1 ed so terrible, so unnatural, that I could not I? believe it. It was not a man alone who had it been cruelly murdered in the hour of his e greatest goodness-it was the heart of a e whole nation which had been pierced by the b. hand of the Parricide. s  But this is not a work in which moraliz- t ing is expected. To describe what was done --that is my task, sad, too sad at that. The grief which fell upon that audience- , the terror which threw darkness, the dark- s ness of death, upon all which had been so a bright, is indescribable. Nor will I attempt X to speak of the wild flood of misery which overwhelmed the wife and the sons and the friends and associates of the noble Martyr. A thousand pens and the most eloquent tongues in all the land have tried in vain to do justice to the gene. I will not follow in the often trodden track. -And now, while the noble martyr is dying, where, where is the assassin71 With a shattered leg, suffering an agony of body and of mind too fearful for descrip- tion, he is riding off at mad speed, guided by his friend Harold. attempting to reach the chief plotters-in the conspiracy which he has carried through-flying to get within the lines yet held by Jefferson Davis and the fiends of the rebellion who yet remained unconquered. And while flying with a thousand terrors behind, before and all around him, we leave the murderer on his way, sure that a just Providence will yet stay him in his flight; we will turn to another of the conspiring fiends and see what he has done.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6976-00000036"/> CHPTEB    XXXLi1 . *. m Wfd* $sMd  1i*tarw1 bt mser, Aa I bw biftewlHk frddr yf, dlt lpstrmihns nled l,'4 ereyg sighed frewell?" ' Bwnowr. In looks Booth was a gentleman, in man-  ners mild, when compared with the dark. browed and desperate man who rode up to a spotnearly fronting Secetary Seward's house, dismounted and fastened his horse. Stal- wart in frame, brutal in expression, we have described him before-the man or brute, Paynme. After dismounting he walked to the light of a neighboring gas lamp and looked at his watch. "It wants but five minutes of the time,' he muttered to himself. "If the rest are up to time and as ready as I am, there will be a pretty muss around town in less than ten minutes." The villain now took a paper from his pocket and examined it carefully. It was a plan of Mr. Seward's house, with 'the loca- tion of his chamber and even of his bed distinctly marked out, by a traitor's hand. I'll have to kill two or three to get at the old curse, I expect," muttered the desperado, as hereplaced the paper in his pocket. "Well, the more, the merrier. If Booth gets off without killing a dozen, he will be lucky. But he has help. I have none-want none. I can do more alone than I could if I had a dozen faint hearted devils to bother me with their help. Two minutes to, time-I may as well be moving." And the brawny wretch moved to the door of the house and gently rung the bell. We will precede him, reader. The venerable Secretary of State, a patriot whose profound wisdom is too widely known to need panygeric from our pen, lay upon his couch, slumber ns quietly, free from a knowledge of pain, while his nurses wer wrapped in Eleep. A daughter and a son with filial lov were watching by his side, and near wai seated a soldier whose own experience a a wounded invalid enabled him to do hil duty as a nurse all the better. For Mt   eward, with broken bones and a bruised form needed carefal attfitoi. Another son was in an adjouig room ready to relieve one of the watchers when his turn came. Suddenly the door bell rung and a mo- ment aftei the voice of tl negro servant was heard, epostulating with some one who wished to enter. No thought of danger came into the minds of the watchers-not a suspicion of an attack upon that poor helpless invalid entered their minds Nevertheless they listened as a heavy ; tread was heard aaceding the stairs, and I stated to their feet as with a wild rush the murderouswretch cameinto the room, a pistol in onehand, and a huge knife in P the other. The daughter fled shrieking for help; the sons and the nurse tried to check the ssasin whoe fiendish eye had already s lighted upon hisintended victim. Dashing them aside with giant strength ' he rushed upon the sleeping Secretary and struck him repeatedly with his murder- ous knife; then thinking his work was e done, he turned upon the others and deal- ing his mad blows right and left, dashed , them helplessly down and fled away, cov- ff ered with blood, leaving a terrible scene r behind him. Four wounded men-two of e- them supposed to be mortally, told how d well he had carried out his part of the programme. He in a moment after was in his saddle, riding off as Booth had done, but on r different route of escape. We will look to another of the party. CHAPTER X      IX1V. uns And   H iHishand did quake, And tremble like a leaf of aspen green, a  And troubled blood thro' his pale lace was seen Ore  To come and go with tidings from the heart, As it a running messenger had been." ye- ras ILL in health and mentally afflicte as by the thousand baseless rumors co lis cerning his personal habits which ha Ir. been spread abroad by the fanatic   ghoul of the Hypocrite Press, the noble hearted, truly self-made man who now stands so firmly at the helm of the Nation, sat on the eventful eve- ning when occurred the dreadful tragedy narrated in the previous chapter, alone in his room, wrapped in painful thought. lHe had too long battled with de famers whom every successful politician has to meet-too long been as a loyal man, a target for the disloyal slanderers of his own state, to fear permanent injury from the maligint howlings of a few canting Pharisees--but the lemon- adeical, milk-and-watery curs which were howling through the land that he  was a drunken sot, calling upon him to E resign, telling him that he disgraced ] his high position, etc., etc., had, weak  as they were, inflicted a cruel wound on ; his warm and patriotic heart.   i Little did they know his Spartan r courage, his Roman firmness, or dream t when they wrote and published their } petty fulminations, how soon he would a be in a position to show anadmiring I world what he was really made of, and to give the lie to their base and base- b less fabrications.        t While half, aye, two-thirds of the t] city was abroad in its mighty search o for pleasure-while even the first Statesmen were seeking relaxation from L thought, Andrew Johnson was seated, tl poring over papers, examining docu- i ments, busied in looking into the wel- a fare of the Nation to which he had de- w voted his life. And at that same hour, in a room te near at hand, with his weapons laid upon a table before him, stood Atzerot, ro the man who had been selected for the N murder of the Vice-President. A half- ro emptied bottle upon the table showed st that he had been endeavoring, as Booth ke did,-to nerve himself for the terrible work by the potent aid of fiery stimu- to ants-but his pale face, his shaking to land, his nervous manner did not prove wo   he that he had been successful in his an efPort to get up "Dutch Courage." Im  He went to the window f-om time to e- time and listened to see if any unusual ly commotion in the street would tell him ne that others were at work as he would il be if he kept his oath and faith with the conspirators. Then he would re- e- turn and drink again, and examine the m pistol and knife which lay there, ready al for deadly use. "a "It is time," he muttered, as he it looked again at his Watch. "If they of give-up the thing and I alone do my - part of the work, there will be no h chance for me whatever. Why did they e not give me some one to help me, or o at least to keep me company? I don't i like this working in the dark, and all alone. But I suppose I must do it, or else if they all succeed, and I alone fail, death will be my portion at any rate. Ah-there goes a horseman down the avenue at full speed. If that is Booth, then his work has been done I and done quickly, while I linger here. - I must do it-I must do it!" And the man poured out a full tum- bler of liquor and drank it off. Then taking up the weapons and concealing them upon his person, he stealtlily opened his door and looked out. The dimly-lighted hall was v;acanu Leaving the door of his room half-open, the wretch crept out stealthily, glanc- ing fearfully around him, as he went, and moved along toward the apartment which he had looked at and even into an hundred times, as he planned his in- tended attack upon its occupant. On tip-toe he reached the door of the room which he intended to enter. Noiselessly he tried the door-knob. The room was locked on the inside. He stooped down and looked through the key-hole. He saw a light. "He is in there!" hesaidin a whisper to himself. "If If knock, he will come to the door and one blow will do the work. I will do it."  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6976-00000037"/> And he raised up and clenched his as hand to give the knock oi What made him pause and start back in terror when in a moment more his work could have been flnishedt He heard hasty footsteps approaching. He hurried back into the dark shadoyws  of the hall as a gentleman came hurriedly to the door which he had just left, and h knocking loudly, cried:     e "Mr. Johnson-I must see you in- b stantly. I have terrible news foryou!" 8 ", There-Booth has done his work-I t] expect they have all succeeded butme!" a cried Atzerot, with an oath, as he fled f to his room. "I am a coward, andnow all I can do is to get away from this l cursed city and the country-too, as  quick as I can." Tearing the pistol l and knife from their hiding places, the I trembling wretch hid them under the a bed clothing, then taking another glass full of liquor, he hurried out of the room and went from the house as speedy as 4 his trembling limbs could carry him. ] His delay, and the coming tothe Vice-  President of that timely messenger, was all that saved to the Nation the life of the great man who is now its Chief Ruler. Long may he live. Atzerot, provided as were all the rest of the conspirators, with a swift horse to aid him in his fight, rushed from the hotel to the place where his horse had been left and mounting, dashed away, well knowing by the sounds of excitement and alarm which he heard on every side, that others had not failed in their allotted work as he had done. Off in the darkness of the night, he sped, in his abject fear scarcely knew where he was going-only feeling that danger, terrible danger now existed for him every where. Thus for the present we will leave him, while we follow on the track of the demon whose hand had not failed, who had carried out the work planed for him by the Fiends of the Rebellion, who had to add   aassination to their black ataloe of crime. CHAPTER XXV., "Revenge is lost in agony And wild remorse-to rage succeeds."' I,^       Bnraow. NOT one minute had elapsed after he fired the shot which made hin for- ever infamous, and martyred the no- blest President America has ever had since the days of Washington, before the assassin Booth was in his saddle and spurring his horse wildly away from the scene of his terrible murder. It was so common in that city for bearers of military despatches to ride in and out at full speed with their im- I portant messages, that a horseman so riding did not often atract particular attention. Booth rode away for several blocks 1 at this rate; but as he drew near a s corner where a horseman sat still upon his horse, he checked the speed of his - own animal andispoke. Ls "Is it you, Harold?" ,f  Yes-have you killed him-have Af you killed him?" askedthe young man, eagerly. ,1  ; Yes!" replied Booth, as a groan a escaped his lips, "and nearly killed t, myself too. One of my legs is nearly re or quite broken, and I am suffering the g, torture of the damned, already." ie  "You are ableto go on, ore you not?" ch asked Harold, anxiously. Id  "Able? You know devilish well it ie will be death to stay. We must gel across Anacostia Bridge just as soon Ie as we can, before the alarm reaches W that point. If we do not, our escape at is cut off, for in half an hour a thousand ed cavalry men will be scouring the city.' he  "Well, let usrideon. Weboth havt ve good horses under us!" said Harold se  "We will not cross the bridge to ed gether-it might create suspicion witi he the guard," said Booth. "I will ride o dd and wait for you until you join me ox   fib -the other side. Tell the guard some plausible story-that you have had a letter from your sick mother in the country, and you will not be detained. I shall ride on and tell them that I am going out to my farm." "Do not fail to wait for me " cried Harold,.as Booth dashed wildly on in the darkness. No answer came back to him, and he sat quiet for a couple of minutes, lis- tening. "Oh, what a man that Booth is!" he said, in a low tone. "He has done a deed which will make him remembered forever. If I had but dared, I might have been great too." Suddenly the sound of a distant bugle broke out on the night air. "I must be going," cried Harold. "If thatis the cavalry alarm, the sooner I am across the old Navy Yard Bridge, , with the open country before me, the better off I'll feel."  And he too, started his horse at a rapid gait, following down the same Avenue which- Booth had taken. In a  few minutes he checked his speed, for  he was*approaching the guard on Ana- costia Bridge, and he knew that any I auspicious act of his-would cause deten- tion. Upon riding up in front of the guard- house at the bridge, he askedif the doc- 1 tor had gone by.         E "What doctor?" asked the sergeant E of the guard, as he scrutinized the face  of the young horseman.      t "The doctor that I sent out to my poor sick mother at the farm. I sent i for him a half-hour since and told the s boy to tell him I would meet him here at the bridge."          n "Where does your mother live?" a asked the sergeant.        y '; At Hedgewoodfarm, about ten miles out, if she is living at all. I got a let- g ter from our overseer to-night, telling y me that she was very sick," replied Harold.              B   "Then you had better ride on," said the sergeant. "A man crossed in a great hurry about ten minutes ago and I expect it was your doctor." Harold needed no pressing to ride on; he was glad enough to pass the guard without further questioning, and he touched his horse with the spur and moved over the bridge at a gallop. It was dark and gloomy when he left th light caused by the reflection of the water, and he had almost ridden upon a horseman standing in the road beyond the bridge before he saw him. "Booth?" he asked, as he checked his horse. "Yes-for God's sake ride on-did you not hear the bugle calls over there? The whole city is alarmed by this time!" said Booth, nervously. "Let them alarm and be d-  d!" said Harold gleefully. ' We've got a free road before us. Come on, now, if you want to race." "Have you got any liquor with you?" asked Booth as they rode off at full speed. "I am so faint with pain that I can hardly keep my saddle." "Not a drop-but the old lady has left a supply of it at Surratville, with our extra arms. You'll have to hold out till we get there." "If I must-I must, but my cursed leg is swelling and I suffer dreadfully," said Booth. "Every leap of my horse sends a thrill of pain through me. I've heard of agony before but curse me if this isn't the reality." "What a time there must be in Wash- ington now, eh?" said Harold. "You're sure you did the thing?" "Sure? Yes! Have you not seen me hit a card twenty times in succession at ten paces with the same pistol? Do you think I could miss at six feet?" "No-not easy.  Well, you are a great man now, Mr. Booth. I envy your fame." ' God!  You can have it!" said Booth, with a shudder. "I would give  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6976-00000038"/> half the world if Ihadit, if I could live the lit hoien ov'ragain. You know not whalt hae lost, boy-you know not what I have lost! I have an old mother o whe almost worships me. She will go dowi in sortoW toiler grave. I have brothers nrd sisters wh6 loed me, with all lmy 'finlt. Thi mad act of mine will bring grief iupi h their fond hearts. If I escape my pursuers, and they will be on my track by the thou- sand, I cannot escape the remorsewhich even now is burning like iell's fire in my breast! It is hell, boy-itiis EiLL!" And great beads of sweat, both from his mental and bodily agony, started out on the cold and clammy brow of the flying assassin. Haroldwas silent. He had expected to hear tlilWnphbnt words of joy at his success, breaking from the lips of the man who could do so bold a deed-not expressions of regret and sorrow so soon. "How far have we yet to go before we reach Surratville V" asked Booth, after they had ridden for some minutes in a silence only broken by anoccasion- al groan or curse from his lips. "Only six miles--we will be there in thirty minutes if we keep up this rate of going," replied Harold. "Then we mustkeep it. I must get somerliqor to stimulate me or I shall fall fr6m the saddle from mere weak- ness!" said Booth. "Are you sure your leg is broken t" asked Harold. "Curse it, yes! I can feel the bone grating against my boot!" replied Booth, with a groan. "How was it done?" asked Harold. "In jumping on the stage. My spur either caught in something, or else I was caught by the foot, and when I struck the stage my whole weight came on one leg. How I got out and on my horse with such a leg is more than I can remember. I only 1new it was death to tarry, and I got away before the *A   people could have fairly-known what I had done." "Do you suppose they knew-you?" "Of course they did. I meant to have had a mask ready to put on as soon as I fired the shot, but I drank so much cursed whiskey during the day that I forgot all about it. By this time my name is over half the country where they've got telegraph wires to carry it. I did another devilish foolish thing at the bridge. The Sergeant asked my name and I gave it without thinking, I had my mind so full of what I had been doing." "I don't believe the Sergeant remem- bered it, for I asked him if the doctor- had passed and he only said some man had gone over in a'great hurry." "Well, I hope he did not remember it. The longer the Yankees are in getting on our track, the safer we wfil be. If it was not for my leg, I would have no fearin regard toour escape. For, once across the river with Mosby's men, the Devil himself, and old'Kilpatrick to boot, couldn't catch us. But this leg-this leg-it is all that I can do to keep in my saddle now. And the longer it goes unset the worse it will be." "You will have to hold on till we get to Bryantown, for we will find no doc- ; tor this side 6f Mudd's where we can I trust ourselves," said Haiold. "Thank fortune, there is Surrattsville in sight, and old ,Lloyd will -be on the lookout for us. ' The old lady was there to make it all right for us this very afternoon. We'll find whiskey and a couple of good I repeating rifles there, and have a chance to water our horses." "I need the whiskey, but I shall not take a rifle. I shall need a crutch be- fore I'll need anything larger than my [ revolvers. This cursed leg is getting e worse and worse every minute," groan- r ed Booth. The straggling houses of a "one- horse village," as Dan Rice, or Josh Bil- I lings, equally original, would call it, *   were now approached, and passin these, where no sign of life was visible except now and then a barkinecur-dog, the two horsemen dashed at a gallop up before a building which had in front a tavern sign. "House ahoy! Is anybody up here?" shouted Harold. "Yes, blast your fool's eyes--can't you see there is " said a man who stood in the door-way. "I expected it was you when I heard you coming." "Yes, it is us," said Harold, with a laugh. "Hand out them tools and the whiskey. We've killed Old Abe, and Seward and Johnson and Stanton too, have gone to keep him company, I ex- pect." "Hush-hush! Do you want all the place to hear you? You'n have a rope around my neck if it is ever found out that you've been bher- Here is the whiskey, a bottle for each of you, and I'll bring down the rifles in a minute." "Bring down but one rifle-I am too badly hurt to carry mine!" said Booth, 5as he snatched the bottle of whiskey from the man's hand, and un- corking it, drank freely. "Do you water our horses, Harold, while he is gone," he added. "Every minute is precious now. We must get to Doctor Mudd's before daylight, and  mind you, boy, no more boasting of  what we have done-at least, not until s we are out of danger. Your folly will  ruin us both yet, if you do not take  more care." Harold made no reply, but dismount- ed and, drawing a couple of buckets of c water from the well, watered the horses,  just as Lloyd came down with a Sharp's  rifle and its ammunition. 'For your own sake, landlord, re-  member if soldiers come this way, no c one has passed your place!" cried Booth, i as he and his companion dashed spurs e into the flanks of their horses, and gal- h loped off.  "For my own sake I'll remember that   ng and more too!" said themanin a surly, Ie growling tone. "'I wish that old she- g,f devil had been in- hell or some other iP place of worship before she got me to a keep arms and liquor ready for them chaps. If I hadn't owed her money "' which I couldn't pay just now, I'd have seen her eating griss before I would 't have listened to her. IfI am found 10 out I'll swing, as sure as my name is it Lloyd. But if I do have to swing, curse me if I'll swing alone. How like a the devil those fellows went-they're e out of hearing already. I'll go to bed, a but precious little sleep will I have this , night." And the man went into the tavern, closing and bolting the door behind him as he went. et.   CHAPTER XXXVI. "Divines, and dying men may tark of hel, But in my heart its several torments dwell." On-on, their tired horses panting at l every leap, and only urged to speed by the keen rowels of the riders' spurs, fled the assassin and his guide, through the long hours of the gloomy night. Now'speeding through straggling set- tlements, again flanked on either hand by dense woods, where the owl hooted mournfully, then riding more carefully over the rough corduroy which paved some boggy swamp, they pressed for- ward until the gloom of night began to lighten with the dull grey of approach- ing dawn. During all these hours Booth had only spoken to ask now and then how much further it was to Bryantown, near which place resided the doctor wiose professional aid he so much needed and upon whose friendship he thought he could trust with reliance. But the Tmingled curses and groans, coming every few minutes from his lips, told how much of both mental and bodily agony he was suffering. It lacked but an half hour of daylight,  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6976-00000039"/> when having just pssed through the small village of Brsautowu, the two men turned off into a side road, and  keeping this for a short istftnce, they drew rein before a large and respectable looking mansion. A light was 'visble in a window on the second story. "I'll bet that the doctor is up andex- pecting us!" said Harold as he pointed to the light. "I hope he is," groaned Booth, " for I have kept the saddle as long as I can. If he cannot relieve me, I'll blow my cursed'brains out, for I am sufferingthe agony of a hundred deaths an hour. Hail the house and see who is awake!" "HallO, the house! HaUo-HALLO there!" cried Harold. "Who is there 7" crieda man, raising the sash of the second story window, where the light had been seen. "Friends, doctor, friends who are in a hurry to see you. One has a broken leg-hurry down!" replied Harold, who recognised the doctor by his voice. He then dismounted and opened the- gate which fronted the yard and led his own horse and that of Booth inside. The doctor, who had also recognised the voice of the speaker, now hurried down and met the two riders at his door, Uilamp yet in his hand. 't Aj-.th and Harold, both here?" hie cri  he recognised their pale and already haggard faces. "Yes-for the Lord's sake help me in, doctor, and see to my leg," groaned Booth. "I have been suffering the tor- ments of hell since ten o'clock. I can feel broken bones crunching at every movement of my horse." "Help me to lift him off," said the doctor to Harold. "I will see first what is the matter, and ask how it occurred afterward." And, aided by the young man, the doctor lifted Booth from his saddle and carried him into the house, where he laid him down upon a sofa.   Booth was senseless now,for hisagony was so great that when he was lifted from his horse he fainted. The doctor hurried to remove his boot while he was yet insensible, and thenused restoratives to bring the suf- ferer back to consciousness. The nmoment this was done, and Booth, groanin;. opened his eyes, the doctor commer- ed an eramination of the injured limb. "The interior bone of the leg is evi- dently broken, and most likely the other bone is injured," said the doctor, after a moment of examination. "How was it done, Mr. Booth?" he continued, as he handed the latter a glass of brandy. "In jumping on the stage of the theatre after firing a shot that sent one man to heavenand me to hell!" groaned Booth. "Curse' the luck-fate is against me. Can you splinter up the infernal leg so that I can go on? The news of ' Lincoln's death is over half the country before this time, and I must be off and out of the country before three days are passed, or I'll hang as sure as you see me." "Then you've done it? Youaresure?" said the doctor, while his face lighted up with a look of pleasure. "Yes, I've done it. But what cn you do for my leg?" replied Booth, his face flushing a little as he felt the gipw of the strong liquor circulate through his stiffened veins. "I can set it, and give you a powerful anodyne. You must have some rest. If I could with safety keep you here two weeks I would'have you all right. But as it is, it is most likely that such a search will be made as would be sure to find you if you stayed here, and it would be death to me as well as you were you found here. I will have your horses hidden away and refreshed with food and rest, and keep you concealed till night, at any rate, and then, if I find that the tide of search is setting this I   way, PIl try and get yon off secretly into a swamp-region, where none but friends will ever find you, and where you can hide till you can be removed to other friends that will help you off." "Thank you, doctor, thank you. The Golden Circle boasts no truer knight than you prove tobe. I know my peril, and I value any aid which lessens it." "Say no more. I will set yourleghere, and then have you up to a room where no one in the housewill see you. Your arrival and stay here must not beknown to a soul beside myself. My negroes are not to be trusted-I will not even trust my own wife with the secret." The doctor now got his splints and bandages ready, and in a short time had the fractured leg bound up skil- fully. Then assisted by Harold he car- ried Booth up to a small thamber and laid him on a bed. Then giving him a powerful narcotic, he told him to re- main quiet, and locking the room? led the way to another chamber. "Do you also lay down to rest," said he to Harold. "You will thus escape observation, and fit yourself for extra exertion if you have to hurry away, as I expect, to-night. I shall keep a look- out to learn if pursuit is made in this direction, and warn you both if danger approaches. Sleep now when you have a chance. I will wake you by and by." CHAPTER- XXXVI. "The blackest ink of fate was sure My lot, And when fate writ my name, it a a blot.' IT was the close of day when Booth woke from the deep slumber forced upon his pain-racked frame by the powerful drugs given to him by the doctor. Through the single window which let the gray twilight into his little room, he could- see that the-day was almost gone. "Oh, God -what dreams!  What dreams!" he muttered, as he pressed his hand to his hot forehead. Am I   1  - Ir never, never to know a quiet sleep ; again " - is door was opened, and the doctor entered, bearing a light and a glass of liquor. "Have you slept well?" he asked, as he approachedthe bed. "Ihave laid in stupor, oppressed by most horrible dreams which I could not shake off!" said Booth, hardly sti- fling a groan as he tried to move his wounded limb. "Have you any news for me?" "No good news," said the doctor, in a gloomy tone. "The village is full of soldiers, and every road in the country is patroled by Cavalry. Your deed has made a terrible excitement, and the worst of all is, that you were so plainly recognized that every one knew who it was that killed the President, and your description is being sent in every direction." "Lend me a razor, and a pair of scis- sors, and I will soon put the description at fault," said Booth. "That I can do, but when they come to search this house, as they probably will, some of them may recognize your eye and features. Both are too notice- able to escape scrutiny," said the doc- tor. "Then after I have cut-my hair and moustache, I must nmnage, helless as I am, to get away from the house into some safer hiding place," said Booth. " Yes," replied the doctor. "Youand Harold must manage to get into the swamps which border the Potomac. i have had a crutch made for you while you slept, and as soon as it is dark I will myself put you on a route to at least temporary safety. You will have provisions with you to last until more can be sent and a map of a route to the lines where you will find Mosby, as also a list of friends whom you may implicitly trust. I have already sent your horses off so that nothing will be found here to put them on your track, or cause a sus-  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6976-00000040"/> piion that youhavebeen here. I would keep you until yowere well, if Idred. I Butlkuow tham ohiousewibittibem g  the first to be searched, for the cursed  Unioniets know and hate me and will put the goveruent officers up as much as possible against me. 1 have a mind to take to the swap with yon. Iwould,' were I not afraidthat my disappearance would make them the more active in looking up your trail." "You had better let us try it alone, doctor," said Booth. "If they follow and find me out, I canbut die. I never will be taken alive. I know that my life is forfeited, but I never will be a captive, to sufferthe ignominy of impris- onment and then to hang in sight of a crowd of barbarians who will exult in my death-agony. I am suffering more than the pain of death now. Were it not for the stimulants I have taken, I believe I would have been dead before now." "Not dead, but so weak as to be helpless," said the doctor. "Drink the rest of this brandy and then I will go and make the final preparations for your departure. Harold is awake andeating his supper now. I will bring you food in a few minutes." "One moment, before you go, doc- tor " ir^S Booth. "You have heard the nei from Washington sinceI left, have yM grot?" Yes--the town is full of it. I have conversedwithseveral officers this after- noon who left there this morning. I talked with them to see if they had got on your track. So far they have not. Every one on the road must have been asleep when you came out." "How many were killed last night?" asked Booth. "Only the President was killed out- right. Seward is supposed to be mor- tally wounded, as well as his two sons.' "And Johnson, Stanton-were they not killed?" ," No-no mention is made of any at- tack on them."   "Then cowardice has left more than Ihaf our work n,doene!" sid Booth aigrily. "Payne seems the only one true to his work beside myself. I had full faith in him, and so gave him the second post of importance. What has kept Atzerot from carrying out his part of the work is more than I can conceive. He was loud in his boasts, but he has signally 'ailed in his work." "Enough has been done to hellp our cause greatly and to fill the North with distraction and terror!" said the doc- tor. "If you only get off safely, you may be well contented with your suc- cess. Excuse me now a few minutes. I go to prepare some refreshments for you and then to get you ready for a move. Keep up your courage-do not despair-do not despair." "I have little enough to hope for. My race is nearly run. I think!" said Booth in a mournful tone as the doctor left, closing the door as he went. CHAPTER XXYVIjU. U Lean abstinence, pale grief and haggard care, The dire attendants of forlorn despair." IT was three days later. In a dense and tangled thicket in the edge of a swamp, the waters of which oozed out into the Potomac, two persons were crouching, only halt-sheltered by a blanket stretched on some limbs over- head, from the dlisding rain which came down from a leaden-looking : sky. Despite his torn and muddy clothes, his close-cropped hair and his face with L a three days growth of beard upon it -despite his gaunt and hungry look the wild eye and sharp features of Booth would yet have been recognized by any of the keen-sighted detec- t ives who were looking for him, had ' they met him even there. Dirty, ragged also, with  hollow cheeks, sunken eyes and hair hanging  tangled about his boyish face, Harold lay shivering on the wet ground, look   g even more wretched than the assas- sin by his side.  "What shall we do-what shall we do,?" he moaned. If we stay here we stave and perish in the wet-if we go out the cavalry will catch us and we aredead men at any rate. What shall we do-what shall we do?" And he moaned and sobbed as if all hope had left him. "Curse you, don't be a baby! If you had to suffer as I do, y'u would have something to complain for. Your limbs are whole and your chances of escape ten times as-good as mine!" said Booth angrily. "I know we cannot live here long exposed to this weather, without fire and food. But here we are on the banks of the Potomac, evidently near the spot where we were to cross and fnd friends on the other shore." "Yes, but how are we to cross " groaned Harold. "I cannot swim, nor can you with that leg. We have no boat and there are gun-boats moving up and down the river all the time." "We must get a boat, and elude them in the darkness. Stay here, we cannot, much longer." "But how can we get a boat? If we venture out of the swamp, ten chances to one we fall into the hands of our pur- suers in an hour. I heard bugles a dozen times last night, and they were not far off." "Look at this map with. me. Here, near this swamp, is marked the planta- tion of Mr. Coxe, whom the doctor told us to call uponfor help when we needed it. He said he was a staunch Confed- erate, and would aid us in every way in his power." , "Yes, I know old Sam Coxe; he is all right, if we could see rim without falling in with anybody else," replied Harold. "Then, my boy, you must see him. You are dressed inConfederate uniform,   Ithe doctor-was sharp in letting us have these clothes. You can pass for one of Lee's paroled soldiers, and get to see Coxe without creating any suspicion." "But Sam knows me-has known me ever since I was a baby." "So much the better, if he is true to our cause. He will help us all the sooner," said Booth. "You are able to walk, and you must go out to see him." And the assassin played nervouily with the butt ofthe large revoluer in his belt. "I don't like to, but if you say I must, I must," said the dispirited young man, as he looked uneasily at Booth's hand and at his large, fierce eyes, grown more intensely bright by his prolonged suffering. "Yes, go on-that is a good boy. Take your pistols with you, but leave your carbine here. If I am surprised, I want plenty of tools within reach. I may die but curse me if I mean to die alone. Go on and see this man Coxe, and tell him we must cross the river. Get food from him and some more liquor. You have gold of mine in your pocket, use it freely. And be careful, boy, how you use your tongue. No more bragging, remember, of what has been done, until we are out of dan- ger." "I'll be careful," said HArola, as he rose slowly, his stiffened limbs seeming utterly unfit for service. "And hurry back-remember how I am suffering," added Booth.  "I will be as quick as I can-look out and-don't shoot me by mistake when I am coming back," said Harold. "No fear. Whistle Dixie as you come along, and I will recognize you by- that before I see you." "I will," said the young man, as he crept away through the mund and drip- ping bushes.  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6976-00000041"/> CHAPTER   WxxiX. "Here' a larg mouth, indeed, That spit forth death, and mountains, rocksand seas; As maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs." IT was the fourth day after the as- sassination of the President. Jefferson Davis, on his line of retreat from the Richmond which he had sworn to hold until its ruins covered him, had halted for'the night at the town of Charlotte, in North Carolina. A small body of ill-clad soldiers, kept together more by the knowledge that he had plenty of gold with him than by any personal love or respect for him, formed his escort. His prospects were dark enough--dark as his own Satanic fame. Lee, foiled by Grant, cut off by Ord, andthreatenedbySherman'striumphant columns, had surrendered his army- Johnson, the last hope of the Confeder- acy, had been obliged to succumb; only a few desperate men, battling against all hope, still remained under arms in Texas. To join them, or escape across the Atlantic, was the only chance left to the wretched traitor; but lying had become so natural tohim, boasting so much a characteristic, that he could not ' refrain from indulging in it upon every opportunity. ,;0 / this Nineteenth of April, having * maaged to draw a small crowd before tie hotel where he had halted for the night, he made a speech full of auda- ciousfolly, as usuaL  "The loss of Richmond," said he, " is only a blessing in disguise. The true men of the Confederacy will fall back into the interior, there unite and rally and drive back the invading Yankees, made drunk by their temporary suc- cess. For myself, I was never more hopeful than now-never more deter- mined to battle to the last for Southern rights and Southern men. I will never desert the South. I may perish in the last ditch but I will die with arms in   my hands, breathing defiance to the foe." At this moment a messenger hurried up to Davis and handed him a despatch just sent to him by telegraph. His face glowed with a fresh light, his eyes flashed with a new fire, as he read it. "Joy-joy, my brave friends!" he cried. "I have glorious news in this despatch just received from one of the truest men in the Confederacy-my Secretary of War, John C. Breckinridge. I will read it to you. '"GREENSBORO, April 19, 1865. His Excellency, President Davis:- President Lincoln was assassinated in the theatre in Washington, on the night of the 14th inst. Seward's house was entered on the same night, and he was repeatedly stabbed, and, possibly, mor- tally wounded. JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE." "It is official, you see, and there can be no doubt of its truth. Is there not now new hope for the Confederacy? Two of our most powerful enemies are gone. And I think that further news will reach us of the death of more of their prominent leaders, for more were embraced in my plans and directions. The death of these men will strike ter- ror to the hearts of the Northern Van- dals-the accursed mud-sills will be but too glad to let us go from the Union on our own terms, thankful if we do not return the poisoned chalice to their own lips and make them drink to the very dregs the cup of misery and desolation. You will next hear, if our plans are all as faithfully carried out as this has been, of some of their proudest cities laid in ashes. Our own Editrs have gone North to control some of their most powerful papers-the proper elements will be worked in our favor-gold has been scattered in the right direction and *e yetwill triumph over those who have thought us beaten. "My friends, I will say no more to- night, but leave you to ponder over my   words and the good news we haie re- cieved." And amid cheers from the rabble and an ominous silence from the better class of his hearers, Davis retired to his quarters, ordering the best supper that could be had and plenty of liquor to celebrate the, to him, joyful occasion. Yes-he, the arch-fiend of Treason, the dastardly miscreant who had mis- led four millions of infatuated men, and who now was flying from his inevitable fate, loaded with the stealings of four years of treachery alike to friend and foe, had the hellishness to rejoice over the consummation of a crime whichcon- vulsed a nation with grief. Let this be remembered in his brief future and let it bang like a mill-stone about his doomed neck. Let it hang like a shadow of infernal darkness about him while he is yet allowed to live, and let it damn him utterly, at last, when a yawning hell opens to receive his miserable soul! CHAPTER XL. "Uncertainty I Fell demon of our fears I the human soul, That can support despair, supports not thee!" Ma;er. Two of our characters have been lost sight of for some time, not that they lacked importance, but because their part has been rather behind the scenes than before the curtain. We allude to Mrs. Surrat, the Amazonian tigress, who was a chief in the plot of assasina- tion, and her daughter, whose greatest crime was loving, not wisely, but too well, its chief actor. Two anxious days, two watchful and sleepless nights, had been passed by both mother and daughter since the tragic occurrence at the theatre, for both were on the tenten hooks of sus- pense-the one dreading, yet almost ex- pecting an arrest, the other fearing each moment to hear of the capture of her lover, yet hoping that he would make C   good hiescape beyond the Confederate lines. "Mother," said she, as, after pacing the floor wearily for some time, she threw herself down upon the sofa. "Mother, this fearful uncertainty' is , killing me. Do you think he will escape?"     * "Who, my daughter? Are you think- ing of John? He is in Canada now, whence no power on earth can drag him, for there our cause has friends." "No, I was not thinking of John, mother. I was thinking of Mr. Booth, you know. If he is taken, you know how certain and how terrible will be his fate." "He will not be taken," said Mrs. Surrat, calmly. "He. has had time to reach his friends long before this. Once with them he is safe. The next you will hear from him he will be across the blue water, where you can join him at a proper timo. He would have been captured before now had he not got, be,- yond the reach of his pursuers. The whole party is safe, I think, for not one of the arrests yet made have reached the right qource." "Do you think they will pass us over, mother? You said we would be among the first to be arrested, but that they could prove nothing against us and we would be safe if they did." "Yes, I so expected, but they have not appeared to hit upon us. That young Weichman has such alongtongue, that I expected he would have talked us into trouble before this time." "Oh, he is a fool, mother. No one will take notice of him." (.Moethave than fool, child," said Surrat, with a cold smile. "The others would have trusted him, had I not told them it would not do. I dis- trusted him as much as I did that cow- ard Atzerot, who has turned out as brag- garts always do, good-for-nothing when put to the test. Payne made a bold and desperate effort, but old Seward hangs  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6976-00000042"/> o to life lpkat At.   other man would have been killed when he. wa thrown from ji earrige but neither bad luk, nor half-a-dozen stabain the jugular, win put him out of the way." A he   L vring at the door-bell was heard at this moment. "Avisitor--sotteasthis!" exclaimed Mrs. Surrat,loolingatherwatch. "Anu nie, benrmnow, for our time oftrouble is at hand. Something tellmethatthisin- trusion is for our arrestd" "Oh mother--mother!" exclaimed the terrifiedgirl. "Becalm, child. Nothing but cool effrontrey and their lack of proof will serve us now. I am going to see if itis the officers who are there. -Be calm and say nothing to commit either of us. Say nothing, appear agitated, terrified by a night visit-that will do." And with a nerve well suited to the bold and desperate plot with which she was linked, Mrs. Surrat went to the front door and opened it. An officer in the uniform of the United States Army, with several other persons, stood at the door, and as soon as she opened it, they entered. "What means this visit, at such an unnsual hour, gentlemen 1" asked Mrs] Sursat, with an air of surprise.. "Duty, Madam. chooses no special time for its execution. It must be per- formed at any and all times. I have the unpleasant duty of informing you that you are under arrest and that every person in this house is in the same con- dition. Where is your son 1" "Not where you will be apt to find hini, sir," said Mrs. Surrat, with a cold smile of triumph. "You will only find a few helpless women here to exe- cute your tyranny upon. My daughter and a couple of lady boarders are the only inmates of this dwelling at present. I had a gentleman boarder, but I under- stand he has been already arrested. At any rate I have not seen him." "You allude to Mr. Weichman?"   "Yes, sir." "He is safe. You willhave the kind- ness to call theother ladies, madam, and not. to attemptsto destroy or conceal anything-papers or anything else. Your entire house is now in the charge of these fficers." "Verywell, sir. If there is law and justice in the land, you may be made sorry for it. But I am a woman, power- less, and must yield." And Mrs.,Surrat led the way into the room where her daughter sat, pale with terror and trembling in every limb. "Call the other two ladies, Annie!" said Mrs. Surrat in a haughty tone. "It appears that we are all to be made prisoners by these valant geritlewfna." Annie made no reply, but rose and went from the room to obey her mother. At that instant a heavy knockwas heard atthe door. Mrs. Surrat started, and turned pale as she heard it. .She knew not who, but feared that her son, or perhaps Booth, had returned. The officer saw her look of fear and confusion, and said quickly to his men, "open the door and secure whoever is there." The officers went to the door, and im- mediately returned, bringing in a large, powerfully built 'man, with well-made, but muddy clothes upon him, and apick- axe in his hand. The officer noticed a look ,of recog- nition, and a warning expression on the face of Mrs. Surrat. She evidently-knew the stranger. "Who are you and who do you want to see?" asked the Major, looking the latter in the face. "Mrs. Surrat. I've got a ditch to dig for her," said the man, gruffly. "The last ditch, perhaps, that we've been hearing about so long," said the officer, with a smile. "Where is the ditch that this man has come to dig for you at this hour of the night, madam V' He must be crazy-I do not know   him-never saw him before!" said Mrs. Surrat indig"antly. "Where do you work generally, my Smant" asked the Major. "Anywhere, where I can get work. There is little enough for a poor man to do," replied the man in the same 4ruff tone which he had used from the first. "Your hands are very white and smooth for the hands of a hard-working man," said the Major, who had been es- awnining him closely. "I don't get work enough to harden them " said the man, sullenly. "We will enquire into that, by and by. At present you are ourprisoner!" said the Major. "'Soit looks!" said the man, sullenly, glaring fiercely at the armed men who surrounded him. At that instant Annie Surrat and two other ladies entered the room. "Payne here?" she said, with an in- voluntary start. "We are lost-we are lost!" "It appears that your daughter knows * this man, if you do not, madam!" said the Major, with a sarcastic smile. "She is scared out of her wits. You would take advantage of her terror to ruin herif you could. But God is just- God is just!" said the woman, with an a air intended to express resignation. "Well-we will depend on His jus-  tice for the detection and punishment i of themurderers," saidthe Major. "You x and these ladies will get ready'to leave the house, madam. A guard will ( be kept over your property, but you t will have to go at once before the Pro- b vost Marshal."  CHAPTER   XLI.  "Bowed and bent, Waxed grey nd ghastly, withering ere his time." BYROS. It was a terrible afternoon and a wretched, miserable night, which John t] Wilkes Booth spent alone in that dark tO   s. and gloomy Swamp after young Harold had gone out to look for Coxe and the y other friends to whom they had been recommended for aid when it was L. wanted.            -, n For the drilzling rain kept pouring e down upon and through the soaked e blanket which was stetched over him -his swollen limb was terribly painful d -all the liquor which he had used as a g stimulant was gone-he was without - food, too wretched and anxious to sleep,  and there he laid and listened to the a croPlking of the frogs, the wailing cry of swamp birdsand the dreary hooting of i the owls, hour after hour. It was terrible, when added ,to the pangs of a conscience not yet seared by , crime into a state ef insensibility. D    "Will they never come! will they never come!" groaned Booth, as he rose ) from his muddy resting place onthe morning after Harold had gone out of the swamp by his direction. "Can it be that Harold has deserted me and has sought his own safety with his uninjured limbs, leaving me here to perish unaid- ed?  If he has, curse him-cuRsE him!" And the suffering man gnashed his teeth at the thought. Suddenly he heard a sound of voices at a distance. Quickly he glanced at the caps of his pistols, and snatching his carbine from its cover, cocked and held it ready for use. "If it is not him, but men in search of me, they had better find the devil than ind me," he cried. "I may die- but I will not die alone. Captured I never will be, alive, for death will be my doom at any rate, and I had better die in arms than by the base hangman's hands." Thus ready, he listened intently to the approaching sounds. At last he heard a whistle. It was the tune of Dixie, and then he knew that Haroldwas approaching, for he was  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6976-00000043"/> making the signal which had been that agreed upon between them.     r His face assumed a more satisied ex- pression, but he still stood upon his tak guard, for his very guilt made him sus- des picious of treachery even in his guide ing and sworn friend. He was not left longin suspense. In a we few minutes, Harold, whistling as he isa came,madehis appearance,accompanied eat by an elderly man, whose suit of grey, as eat well as his sallow and weather-beaten b countenance, told that he was a Confed-  erate and hadseen service.     ve "I thought you never would get we back! I have passed a terrible night!" ca said Booth, impatiently, as Harold ap- th proached. "1 could not help it, Mr. Booth," said fo Harold, in an apologetic tone. "It was nearly dark before I got out of the ye swamp, and almost midnight before I a found this gentleman-Capt. Coxe. I ce knew I never could trace my way back in the night, and we had to wait until g morningtofindmytrack. Butheavens, a how you are altered, Mr. Booth! Your h very hair is turning grey-your face is r wrinkled and ghastly-they need not I think your description wil help. to find i you, for you no more look like yourself a when you was in Washington, than I do i like Tommy the Japanese. But I for- got-Capt. Coxe-this is Mr. Booth."  The Confederate officer advanced 3 and took Booth by the hand.  "I am sorry to see you in such a mis-  erable state, sir," said he, "after you have done such a bold deed for the South. I will help you all I can, ut it is little that can be done now, for the whole country is filled with soldiers and detectives after you, and the immense rewards for your arrest." "o-there is blood-money on my head!" said Booth, with a ghastly smile on his pale face. "Yes, enough to enrich the man who ,arr&amp;ts you. Butdonothediheartened -you havefriends left who wilL Lo ao   that can be done to get you out of the- reach of your pursuers." "No one man, nor yet a dozen shl take me alive! I am well fixed for a desperate defence!" said Booth, point- ing to his weapons. "Yes-I am glad to see that you are well armed. But you are weak. Here is a bottle of whiskey, and something to eatin my havresack. Take a drinkand eat something and we will then talk about your future movements." Booth, chilled with the wet to his very marrow, and faint with hunger, was glad to obey the directions of the captain, and soon felt much better under the potent effects of the strongliquor and the strengthening inflience of the I food. "Has the search for me yet reached your neighborhood?" asked Booth, I after he had satisfied the present I cravings of his appetite. k  "Yes," replied Coxe. "My house and i grounds have been thoroughly searched, s, and as no sign of you has yet been seen r hereabouts, or even heard of in this di- is rection, I hope I shall be troubled no at more. If so youwillbe safe with me d duntil I can push you on over the river if and get you further South out of the lo reach of the Yankees altogether." r-  Well, Captain, I will proceed as you direct. I can hardly move, even with ed my crutch, and if it is possible to hide me in a safe place until my leg gets bet- s- ter, I shall be glad." u  "We wili try it, when night comes he on again," said Coxe. "I dare not risk it moving you out of the swamp in day- he light. Stay here untilI come again, and ad make yourself as comfortable as you ie can. When I return I will whistle the same tune which your young friend did ny just now, and you will know me. Make ie free use of theliquor and grub; I have plenty more for you when that is out." rho "Thank you, captain. I had about led given up to despair until you came, but al I feel as if I was worth a dozen dead   men now," replied Booth, in a cheerful tone.' "Do you want Harold to go with youi "      , -  "No; he must remain to keep you company. If all is clear and free from  anger outside, I will be with you gain about dark, ready to take you out to my house!  And with these words the Confederate Optain turned an&amp;went away. CHAPTER XLII "The ghost of Cesar hath appeared to me, -TWo'several times by night: at Sards once; And this last night,here in Phillippi's fields; I knowmy hour has come." BRUTS. IT was some days later. Worn down to a whadow by remorse, long watching, and bodily suffering, Booth, yet attend- ed byHarold, but deserted by all others, lay stretched upon the ground in a barn back from the travelled road which he had been almost creeping over in his slow and terribly painful effort to es- cape the justice which was on his blood- stained track. Hunted away from the house of his friend Coxe, aided across the Potomac, he had got so far away from the region where pursuit had been hot, that young Harold tried to cheer Booth with the thought that now they were safe. "No," said Booth, gloomily, as he 'looked out on the gloom of the night which had just fallen upon them; "no, Harold, we are -not safe, nor can I es- cape from my doom. I feel the chill of approaching death at my heart now. Twice have I been warned. I never ,was superstitious before, nor was I ever a believer in dreams. But twice have I seen the ghastly form of Abraham iLincoln, standing over me with a look of sad reproach. Once it was in the night, when you left me alone in the swamp on the other side of the Potomac. The second time was bat a minute ago, when the night gloom was deepening over the sky. I had but one-glance at   Itheterible spectre, and it vanished. I am doomed, Ir am doomed c" Haolda lhuddered, and made no reply for some time. At last he said; ; "Iaishwehad a lighthere. I don't know why, but the very darkness scares me." , "It will be darker yet for both of us before we see light," said Booth, in a gloomy tone. I am sorry for you, my poor boy. But for myself, it is useless to repine, as it is to struggle against fate. There is blood upon my hands, :and blood, my blood alone, can wash out the cursed stain." "Oh, don't talk so, you terrify me," said the young man, shuddering. ' Then go-go and leave me to die alone!" said Booth, impatiently. ' I know I must die, and I will meet my fate manfilly. I have dareddesperately, and I will not now die like a snivelling X coward. Go! use your strength and free limbs, and leave me to my fate." "No no! I will not leave you, Mr. Booth," replied Harold, with a trem- bling voice. "If I wanted to, I dare not go out in the dark alone. Hark! I hear horses out on the road!" "Yes! yes, at a gallop, and they have  passed on!" said Booth, after listening in silence for a few seconds. "There is no use for me to hope. They are ahead of us now, even on this road. If they pass on, they will cut us off in that directiion." And with a groan of despairing wretchedness, the miserable man sank back upon the ground, from which he had partially raised himself. "Take a drink; there is a little left in the bottle yet," said Harold, nervously. ",No; I want no more of it. Take it yourself, and see if it will arouse your courage any," said Booth. "I havt taken my last drink; I shall never sec the day dawn again." "This is awful-this is awful!" said Harold. "You never have given up before."  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6976-00000044"/> No; but had you seent V ,il.  seen this night, boyi yout, t4i e I despair. It isof no u #t1*i Afl4 e.

I should die of very tertor then, for I feel like death now,!' moaied 1Hrold, all of his manhood utteity gone.  "Drink upthe liquorand nerve your. self for the wort. We cab die but once," said Booth. "I have drank it, and it has no more effect on me than Water," said the boy. "If I could only sleep-if I could only sleep. I am tired--o tired; but I can- not sleep." Booth made no reply, but seemed to relapse into thought. And thus hours -terrible hours to both of those wake- ful wretches, wore on. Harold was the first to break the silence. His ear had caught the sound of a cock crowing in the distance. Morning is coming!" he said. "Thank God! morning is coming at last!" A No; it is not morning, but my doom that is approaching!" said Booth. "I heard the tread of horses just now when my ear was on the ground. There- listen! do you not hear the sound?" "Yes-yes. God have mercy on us!" moaned the young man, with chattering teeth. If they come here we are lost!" "They are coming nearer and nearer. Is the bar across the barn door?" said Booth, his tone growing firmer as dan- rger seemed to approach: Yes-I fited,it firm in its place." "And my weapons--the pistols and rifle-here they are. We must die, boy -we must die-but let us die game." "Oh Lord, I do not want to die-I do not want to die!" moaned Harold, in a piteous tone. X "Coward! creep out before they   aobge. fYi itie# 1 caitti go," aid bi   i  tam iM- 3WMA  Pt"  for* faetr'. #Od *1 baS I o mercy on such a ^  b  M  b t Ab i.oer swat clode, Wbe a&amp;t  (*   - ppinter is lealg themt right here!"

Booth etept to one of the cracks near the door and I*led out, while Harold lay in trembling silence on the ground. He saw by the dim star-light that there were at least fifteen or twenty armed men between him and all chances of escape. "t Hallo in there! Hallo! Come out of that and give yourselves up!" cried a commanding voice from outside. "Who are you? What do you want " cried Booth, creeping back to where he had left his rifle, and taking it in his hands. "It don't make any difference who we are, we know who yoZ are, and we want you!" cried the same voice. "Captain, I am a cripple, with a broken leg. I cannot run but if you'll draw your men off a hundred yards and give me a man's chance, I'll come out and fight you all!" cried Booth. "We are not here to fight a murderer, we are here to take him!" replied the same man outside. "Well, you may as well prepare a stretcher for me-for you'll never, get me alive!" cried Booth. "Oh let us surrender-let us surren- der-they will not kill us now!" moaned Harold. "Give yourself up, if you will-you base coward-give yourself up if you will. I will die first!" cried Booth.   "I surrender--I surrender!" cried Harold, risingand staggeringtothedoor. In a moment he was seized and drag- ged out. "Now do your worst. The man who approaches me dies!" said Booth, bit- terly. "If you know who I am, you know that I am not afraid of blood." "You may not like fire, if you do not fear blood!" cried one of the men out- side. "Come out, or we'll burn you out." "Try it, if you dare. If I chose I could kill half of you now. I have had a head on your, captain a half dozen times, but if you'll let me alone-I'll spare you." cried Booth. At that instant a flash of light told him that the threat of firing the barn had been put into execution. In a moment the hay was in a blaze, lighting up his face, in which vindictive rage and despair were both depicted. "Cowards! I will not die alone!" he yelled, and he raised his rifle to his i shoulder.  But ere his finger could press the a trigger, there was a blinding flash and  a sharp report and he fell forward on the ground as a ball went crashing t through his head.         a In a moment several men and officers I rushed in and dragged his body out from a the burning barn. He was not yet dead g -water was brought, and his brow and i lips were bathed with it. But his wound a was mortal, and his agony was only t prolonged for a little while. Withp moans of misery and remorse bursting st from his lips, he lingered for an hour or M so, and then his soul went from his mis-  erable body before that dread tribunal a from which there is no escape.   dc Day dawned, lut its light came not fi to his eyes. As he had said to Harold, lo they would be, they were now closed st in a darkness which no mortal light, b could penetrate.          on His doom was indeed sealed-his career was ended.         t   id  Harold, cowardly as he was, when he r. lookedupon the cold corpse of his friend, g- envied him the rest which could know no more bodily suffering. For now he to had the horror of,death, a terrible death t- yet before him, for he knew that he Lu was in the hands of justice from which escape would be impossible. ,t There for the present we will leave ;- him, while we glance away for a u moment once more upon the chief mover in this dreadful dance of Death d -the fugitive Davis. 3;    CCHAPTER XLHTI. "And, though he posted e'en so fast, His fear was gr3ater than his haste; d   For fear, though feeter than the wind, Believes 'tis always left behind." NIGHT in a gloomy pine barren in ) Georgia-night with its darkness feebly lighted up by the bivouac fires of a small party of dusty and travel worn fugitives, flying for their lives over the land which they had sworn to make free and independent of all rule but their own. Who is this pale and haggard man, whose uncombed hair, unshaven beard and soiled garments make him look so miserable? This man around whom a a few hungry looking troopers are gathered, and near whom we see stand- ing a group of dejected-looking women and children? Can it be the boasting traitor who has said that he would perish in the last ditch before-he would surrender one of the Southern rights which he had claimed? Can it be the man who has asked thousands of brave and misguided men on to battle and to death in his support? Can it be the fiend-it is wrong to call hlu ma ti any longer-who haW forced his m in% as to starve and murder our captured soldiers by the thousand in the Southern pris- on pens? It is-it is DAvIS, standing pale with terror before that glimmering bivouac  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6976-00000045"/> fire, listening hile an aid reads to him  the fate of the assassin Booth, and of ml the arrest of the conspirators in the as fci sassination winh whichhe is so indelibly linked. He pales and trembles when he wi hears of these arrests, for he knows that B his own complicity in the crime could fo only be hidden by their escape from them hand of justice. "They follow up the matter with fearful haste!" he muttered to his sec- retary, Breckenridge, who stood by his side and was yet among the few who had not deserted him with his fallen fortunes. "Yes; I fear they will follow us too fast for our safety. We had better leave gold and everything else behind us and h only try and get out of the country with 1 ourlives. We cannot travel half fast  enough with these wagons and the wo-  men with us," said Breckenridge.  "We must keep to the gold, for that t will be our most powerful aid in escap-  ing!" said Davis. "If I had not that E along, our escort would have deserted  us long ago. As to the women, they will travel as fast as we can I am sure. I am nearly worn out now, and I hear no murmur from their lips. We have made good time since we left North Carolina." "Yes--but there are telegraph lines in operation south of us, where Sher- man has been, and if the cavalry yet left South cuts off our escape, there is no hope for us." "That is so!" said Davis gloomily. "But even if we are captured, we may not be harmed. I know that England will intercede for us. I have funded enough money in that country to make friends who will try to get me over to spend it amongst them." ," English friendship is all bosh!" said Breckenridgecontemptuously. "I should think you had been fooled long enough by thedouble-dealing and hypocrisy of * that country. Selfishness is all that  predominates with the English Govern cr   ment. You are down now and in the mud. Fngland will never soil her fingers to pick you up." "Not without I escape to her shores with money enough to buy a barony. But I'll talk of it no more. I must rest, for I am worn out nearly and dawn must find us on the march again," said Davis wearily. CHAPTER XLIV. ," The heaving sigh, The tear in the half-opened eye, The pallid brow and cheek confess'd That grief was busy in her breast. NOT as we first saw her, gay and happy in her beauty, smiling over her love-dreams, do we again behold Annie Surrat. The news of the death of her young heart's idol has reached her, even  in the prison cell where she is detained to act as a witness against her own mother, and the other blood-stained con- spirators, with whose complicity in the terrible crime she is but too well acquainted. Pale, her eyes dim with weeping, sunken too, beneath the heavy lids, her face expressive only of misery, she sits in silence, in her little room, though another female also kept as a witness, sits by her side. It must be grief and heavy trouble indeed which can keep two women silent, when they are to- gether, for talking is the last privilege on earth which they will resign. The silence, in truth did not last y long. "d Do not grieve, so much, my dear I Miss Annie. The officer who confined e us, you know, said that we were under ;o no charges and only keep as witnesses," said the young lady who shared her id confinement. id  "You can bid me not to grieve, who ,h know not what sufferingis!" said Annie of in a despairing tone, while tears started at freshy from her eyes. "It is not enough thhavelost athat I have lost a thamade life worth   possessing--that my heart's love has been killed, and his mangled body hid away from mortal sight forever; but I must be held here to swear away the life of my own mother. I would have accused myself, so as to share her dungeon and her fate, but she for- bade my doing so on penalty of her curse. Oh, if I were but as stern and daring as she, I could meet these terrible misfortunes all as calmly. But I am only a weak, weak woman, and I know it. Why must I suffer, who am so ill able to endure suffering. Poor Booth! -he is past all suffering. I ought not to mourn for him, but my widowed heart will sob out its grief in spite of me." The girl ceased speaking, for the bolt of the cell-door was thrown back, and one of the officers of the prison entered. "Miss Surrat," said he, in a kind tone, "there is another,witness detain ed here who. is very desirous of speak- to you. It is not exactly regular, but as he seems to be a great friend of yours, I am willing to allow the inter- view if you desire it." "He? Who is it, sir, that is so bold as to profess friendship to one in such deep trouble as I am?" "Lewis Weichman, the gentleman who used to board with your mother," replied the officer. "Gentleman! HE a gentlemam?" and the eyes of the young girl flashed wildly, as she spoke in a tone of utter indig- nation; "why, sir, he is the spy who will hang my poor mother if he can. The villain who pretended the most sincere frienpship for us, that he might learn our secrets, and then betray them. Has he the impudence to pretend friend- ship now, and ask an interview with me?" "He certainly speaks in a very friendly manner of you, asks frequently after your health and only a few mo- ments ago expressed a desire to see you. But if you object, of course he can have no interview with you." "I do object, sir-indignantly and positively. Tell the contemptible villain that I would sooner look upon the darkest fiend of hell than to see and speak to him. Tell him if my mother dies, her blood will lay at his door and my curse shall hang black over him till he dies and Satan takes hird home. Tell him I hate and despise him; and werehe to come into my presence I'would spit upon him!"   'The officer looked in surprise upon the change which anger produced in the appearance of the young lady. She was no longer pale nervous and bowed down in despair. Her eyes were bright and flashhing-her face was flushed and brilliant. Her form seemed to tower up and swell in height and pro- portions. He said no more, but turned away and left the cell, carefully barring and bolting it behind him, ere he went away CHAPTER   XLV. And underneath that face, like summer's ocean's, Its liptas noiseless, and its cheek as clear, Slumbers a whirlwind of the heart's emotions, Love-hatred-pride-hope--sorrow, all, save fear." FRos the daughter to the mother. Closely confined in a small and secure cell, in a different prison from that in which her daughter was kept, Mrs. Sur- rat awaited the hour to arrive when she was to be put on trial for her life. Bold and defiant, she had made no murmur when she was arrested-and in her close imprisonment she made no complaint. She had asked for and received permis- sion to employ counsel for her defence, and she had engaged the most powerful legal talent within her reach. Visited frequently by officers of the prison, who had directions to see that none of the prisoners should by self-de- struction anticipate the punishment of the law, which one of them, Payne, had already attempted, she received them always with the same haughty in- difference which had marked her de- meanor from the moment of her arrest. But one thing womanly could be ob- served in her present conduct. She asked occasionally, and always with signs of deep feeling, about the health of her daughter Annie. When told that she was despondent and wretched, she begged to be allowed to see her. When told that this was impossible, the order being to'keep her (Mrs. Surrat) totally excluded from all persons until her trial came on, she inveighed bitterly against the cruelty which could keep a mother from her child, And begged at least to be permitted to write to her. This also was against orders. But an officer having more sympathy in his heart than her crimes merited, carried a verbal message to the daughter, Mrs. Surrat begging her to cheer up, for she was in no danger.  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6976-00000046"/> frhen the officer who conveyed the message again visited the cell of Mrs. Strat, she asked him with nore than usual emotion about the health of her daughter. "She is very low and nervous-fret- ting herself into a shadow," said the officer. '* I deliered to her the cheer- ing message yu sent, but she refused to believe in your safety, and grieves most that the wMil be compelled to give testi- mony in your ease." "' She is weak--very weak," said Mrs. Surrat. "Nothing which she can swear to will hurt me. Thatwreteh Weichman is the only one whose evidence will en- danger me and means will be found to kill the weight of that. Things may look darknow,butthey willbebrighterby and by. But my poor girl-I must see her. Will not gold purchase for me permis- sion to spend an hour with her?" "No madam. Our orders are too strict to permit of any evasion of them. I would do far more out of sympathy than I would for a promise of reward." "Then you are unlike most Yankees!" said the lady, with a cold, sarcastic smile. "I thought they all had a price." ' You were in error, Madam." Well, I meant no offence to you, per- sonally. You must obey the orders of the tyrants who at present have me in their power. Do you know when my trial is to cor off?" "Not the pecise time, Madam, but the court is ordered, and will soon con- vene!" "Is it to be a military or a civil court?" "Military, Madam,'I believe." "Then my doom is sealed!" muttered the woman, and her face paled for a moment. But the color came back directly, and she said in a bitter tone: "They dared not risk a jury trial. They feared that I might find friends and sympathizers among citizens who had not been steeled to heartlessness on the battle-field." "Madam, were Ia woman I wouldfar sooner trust my fate in the hands of sol- diers, who ever possess a high sense; of honor, and whose characters, naturally chivalric, would look with far more len- iency upon crime in a woman than in a man,looing upon herasbeing weaker in character and more easily led into error than a man would be."   "Out upon such sympathy! I despise , -   it. The judges who expect to find less of firmness and less strength of charac- ter in Mary Surrat than they will in a man, will be wofully mistaken. Had I been in the place of some whom you  have arrested, there would have been more blood shed than is now complained of. Your Secretary of War would not now be gloating over my sufferings, or your accidental President be panting for the hour to arrive when he can sign my death-warrant. Oh, if my curaeA would annihilate them both, they would not encumber the earth another hour." "Madam, I cannot remain here to listen to such talk. Is there anything that I can do for your personal comfort, not contrary to the prison rules?" ' No sir-- I ask no favors- expect none. I expect that my fate is sealed, my doom already written. But if my enemies expect to hear a word of fear from my lips, they will be disappointed. I have lired fearlessly--I can die brave- ly. Let the worst come-I am ready for it." The officer made no reply, but left the cell. CHAPTER XLVI. BanSeSd Hthe damned use that word in hell; Howlings attend it; how hast thou the hearts To mangle me with that word-bauahninent"!" Another lonely bivouac scene in the verge of a Southern Swamp. Deserted by nearly all his escort, whom even gold could not retain, in companywith a few friends who still clung to his fallen fortunes. But not one in ten of those, who had left Richmond with him, re- mained now with the powerless Chief of the Caved-in Confederacy. Of his Cabinet, only Reagan and Breckenridge remained. TI. others were his personal aids and his private Secretary. Two tents only were erected-one for the women and children, the other for the men. The bivouac-fire shewed the tired and hungry horses feeding from. a scanty supply of forage, while the men stood in a gloomy and dispirited group near the fire, consulting upon their future movements. Davis had been urging the continu- ance of the party on a route which would lead to a crossing on the Missis- sippi, hoping yet to reach Texas and. with the army of desperate men yet under arms there, to continue the re- bellion.   "It is useless,sir, to hope to reach Texas, Or even to think of remaining upon American soil." said Brecken- ridge, in reply to the words of Davis. "If we can but gain the sea-coast, we can perhaps escape with life and be con- tent with banishment." "Banishmentl" said Davis bitterly. "The foul fiends take the word and soul of him who invented it! I would sooner die Ithan be forced Arnold-like to live out ' miserable life in a foreign land!" "I Would rather live there, than hang here!" said Beckenridge, "And if it is your firnfdetermination to risk oing further West instead of striking direct for the Coast, I for one shall consult my own judgment and safety, and take a new route." "Go when you please, sir, and where you please. My day of command is over " said Davis, in a tone of marked displeasure. "And your day of safety, too, I fear," said Breckinddge. "Tom," he added, addressing a negro servant who sat roasting his bare heels at the fire," sad- dle my horse and your own. I am go- ing to ride further to-night." "Why are you in such a hurry to leave us, Breck?" inquired Reagan. "You know well that we heard a cavalry bugle not ten minutes since. I do not consider it safe to stay here," re- plied Breckinridge. "It was not a marching call that we heard," said Davis. ' It was merely a camp-call, and there is no body of cav- alry near us in motion. At any rate our animals are too tired to move, and it is too dark to find the road." "Dark or not, I shall not stay here to be singled out on a fire-light like this, and hear the cry, ' Surrender or die.'" "Sir, your fears magnify our danger," said Davis. But his oFn cheek was pale and his manner nervous, even while he spoke. "Your protection from punishment lays in that tent, sir, or your slur should have its reward on the instant!" said Breckenridge, angrily, as he pointed to the tent where the women were shelter- edfrom the night dew. "And the time may come, if the halter does not antici- pate my wish, when I can prove to you on a fdir field which has the most cause for fear." "Do hosses all up an' ready, massa," said the negro servant, who hadl un- hitched and tightened the girths of the   two thoroughbreds which were owned by Mr. Breckenrldge, "I shall be miles away froml here by daylight, and you sir, I would almost wager, will 'be in the haIds of the Yankees by that time. I shall shed no tears if you are," said Breekenridge, as he put his foot in te stirrp. Mounting, he at once rod  offl, follow- ed by his servant, leaving Davis too antr to reply. That his prediction was fated to be verified, the next chapter will show. CHAPTER XLVl. "He stands, as stands thestricken deer Checked midway in the fearfil chase, When bursts upon his eye and ear The tireless ro'ber baying near  Between it and its hiding plaoe- While still behind, ith yell nd blow. Sweeps, like a storm, the coming foe"' "EFT now by all but a half dozen of his most faithful adherents and uncum- bered by a party of helpless women and children, awaretoo, by scouts, that the Federal Cavalry was scouring the coun- try in search of him though not yet knowing that a reward was offered for his arrest which would buy the faith of two-thirds of his most rampant follow- ers, it may be thought that Jefferson Davis could not slumber lightly in the tent to which he retired after the de- parture of Mr. Breckenridge. His sleep was fitful, for dreams of ap- proaching evil sat like night-mares in his troubled brain. The grey of dawn was just beginning to lighten the dense gloom of night, when he rose from the ground upon which he had stretched his weary frame, and approached the fire to stir up the dying embers. While thus engaged, all others in the camp still laying asleep, his ears sud- denly caught the sound of the tranmp of horses. He listened a moment for the direc- tion of the sound. It seemed to be coming from every side. An instant more, while he was yet uncertain what to do, whether to fight or fly, or to hope that these might be friends instead of foes, and he saw the dusky forms of horsemen closing in all around the little encampment. It was too late for flight, clad as he was in Confederate grey, for the fore.. most horsemen were nearer to the spot  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6976-00000047"/> wheres Wh* n saddle horse was fasten- ed thale was.

But the disciplined soldiery outidei celosed in speedily and without no,; atld each of the men ex- cet 'the eli{f rebel alone, were arrested as they roO. The federal officer in charge of the cavalry was about to enter the tent in which the females were huddled, when Mrs. Daviy exclaimed that there were only women and children there, and asked for a few minutes time to dress in, before they were disturbed. This time was granted by the cour- teous officer; andin another moment, the lady asked another favor. She reques- ted that her maid might be permitted to go tothe spring near by, for a bucket of washing water. This too would have been granted, had not the quick eye of the officer detected something very unlike the delicate ancles of a maid beneath the skirts of the veiled figure which came out of the tent, bucket in hand. ' Cavalry boots and spurs are rather too heavy for your servant to wear, Madam!" said the officer,with a smile as he lifted the skirts of the supposed female with the point of his sabre. "This woman ought to go with RarnMnms bearded lady!" cried his sergeant, as he tore aside the veil and pointed to a grey goatee on the rough chin of the maid. "Do not make him angry-he will hurt some of you!" screamed the lady, losing her presence of mindwhen she saw how easily the disguise of her hus- band was penetrated. "We will risk, that, Madam!" said the officer, and in a moment, stripped of hi dastardly disguise, Jefferson Davis, the rampant Rebel who had vowed to die in the last ditch before he would succumb to federal authority was a quiet, submissive, trembling pris- oner in our hands. His wife with ten times his courage, had Epirit enough left to use her tongue in bitter denunciations of the low-born Yankees -who dared to arrest the 'Presi- dent."  ^ But the Nationat large has long since :b. een made cognizant of all the particu- $ thisarrest, therefore we will not in-  inge upon the time or patience of our   readers with a repetition of the account but rather hasten on to the desoinaen of our story. CHAPTER XLV'If. - They hope, but hope tho late alas, That they fromq' *ldrance vile' may pass, To the free atmosphere of life, Its cares and trtuggles, toil and ettft.'" ONE after the other of the conspira.' tors in that dreadful crime which brought a cloud of grief over a Nation which had just begun to rejoice in a proudly conquered Peace, were arrested until John H. Surrat and the secret members of the order of the K. G. C., who were cognizant of, but not direct actors in the terrible tragedy, were alone free. Surrat, flying to Canada at the last hour of action, coward-like left his mother to struggle through her trial alone-his young sister to suffer her agony by herself Harold, Payne, Atzerot, Spangler, Arnold, O'Laughn, Mudd, and last, but not least, the Jezebel of the Conspiracy, Mary E. Surrat, were under arrest and confined beneath the same roof. The question of their trial was brief. The uncertainty of civil law, the treacherous trickery of lawyers, and the chance of bribery of jurors was all to - be avoided, and the power of a military commission, stern and inexorable in its justice, sure and prompt in its action, and swift to execute when sentence is pronounced, wasto be exerted. It is not necessary for the writer of this story to follow the wretched prison- ers through a trial in which they were ably defended by their chosen counsel, a trial in which the guilt of all was proved beyond even the shadow of a doubt. The Chief Conspirator and actor in the tragedy, John Wilkes Booth, was, as the reader already knows, punished by a speedy death, without having to linger through the agony of a lengthy trial in which he, as they, might have been certain of but one ending-death. The principal actors in the conspiracy after weeks of patient examination into' their complicity in the crime, were found guilty of it, and sentenced to death. These were Harold, Payne, Atzerot and Mary E. Surrat. Their associates Arnold, Mudd and O'Laughn, little less guilty, were doomed to spend their lives athard labor in prison, and to end their days in that living tomb.   A brief glance at the first four, when they heard of their doom, and then a picture of that fate and our story is done. Payne was visited in his cell by the officer deputed to read his sentence to him, after it was promulgated, and to inform him of the briefme left ere its execution would be cateid out. Cold, calm and with the same haughty indifference which had marked him throughout all the trial, he listened to the reading of the sentence. When the officer, even more excited than he was, ceased reading, he remarked in a quiet tone: "It is what I expected. I took my life in my hands when I engaged in the game.  loose it-that is all." "Do you wish to see any of your friends before you die " asked the offi- cer, in a kind tone. "No. I have no friends who could reach me in time. You have tried me under a false name, and those whom I love most will not know my. fate. I ask no favors-have no regrets except that I did not succeedin my attempt andstrike home while weapons were in my hand." The officer turned from him and next visited Atzerot. Brutal and stoical as this poor wretch had seemed during all the time of his trial, he was now wildly alive with anx- iety to know his fate. Trembling from head to foot, his face alternately in deathly pallor and flush ed with the fever of misery, he listened to the reading of his sentence. "To be ha nged! Tobe HANGED!" he shrieked, as the officer concluded. "Oh, mercy-mercy! Oh, why will they not let me live in prison. I ask no more. Life, life-is all I ask!" The officer coull give him no hope, but left him to groan away the few hours left to him in despair. Harold, who knew well what his fate must be, for his complicity with Booth was so-plainly proven that there could be no escape for him, heard his sentence read with a silence which showed that he had no other hope. From Iis cell the officer went to that of Mrs. Surrat. Boldly, almost defiantly she had borne herself during her trial. And it seemed as if she had hoped in spite of the overwhelming evidence against her, that her sex would save her from being brought in upon an equality of guilt   with the others, and to share alike fate. But when the oficer read her sen-  tence and she kntew that but a few hours intervened between her and a shameful death upon the saffold, an ashy paleness overspread her face and for a few momenta 'she was dumb and motionless'in her mental ageny. But then the eolorceame rushing back into her cheeks and a wild shriek of misery broke from her lips. "Oh I am not ready todie! I am not ready- to die!" she cried wildly. "They cannot-they will not4ang me, a woman! I did not do the murder! Is there no hope? Will not the President pardon me? Oh, let the priests come to me. I will die here before they shall hang me!" The officer, who could speak no word ofhope tothat wretched criminal, turned away to do the only favor he could for her-to send to her aid the spiritual comforters for whom she called. Strange that in this awful hour she neither spoke of her traitor son, equally guilty with herself, but by her foresight and care now beyond the reach of the doom which menaced her-or even of her unhappy daughter whose unwilling evidence ha0i helped to fasten her cer- tain guilt upon her. But the terror of death alone filled her heart. CHAPTER XLUX. The kuell, the shrod, the mttock and thegrave, Tne deep, dmp vaulthd darkaess an the worm." Youro. As long as that sad Friday, the 14th of April 1865, wh be remembered, as the anniversary of the cruelmartyrdom of Abraham Lincoln,.so will be held in memory also the 7th day of July, 1865, as the anniversary of the punishment of the chief conspirators in the dreadful crime. The sun rose clear and cloudless on the Friday last named, throwing its glittering light upon the scaffold of doom erected for the execution of crimi- nals'who had no mercy for the good and great who had perished, and who could not now, themselves, hope for mercy. All the kindness ever extended to the doomed criminals they received, but they were in the hands of that stern justice which claims life for life, and thero was no hope on earthfor them, Their execution is but a matter of hiby tory, and as history we give it, from tha statement of an official report,  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6976-00000048"/> TBM Il Oa 1"OrBp ,THE 8CAFIOLP.

Brat, lean- ing upon two Rentlemen, isued forth, foowed by Pathers Wiget and Walter, the latter of whom carried a small cross with an effigy of $he Savior thereon, and also a book of prayer. She looked very pale; her limbs seemed tofail her, and it required no small exertion on the part of the gentlemen alluded to to lead her as fa as the saaffold steps. Step by step she ascended, her hands manacled behind her, every eyeunited on her now shrunken cheeks. Her face betrayed more of horror than of physical fear; her npper lip, as somletimes seen in the newly dead, curled upwards from the now intomplete teeth, which added greatly to the ghastli ess of her expres- sion. She sat on a chair placed at the northwestern corner of the scaffold, and immediately the reverend gentleman waiting upon her leaned forward, ap- plying the crucif to her ashen lip, and pouring into her ear the words of com- ortexpected to soothe to resignation the rebellions hmran heart that sets it- self against the decree of mortality up- on the scaffold, the field, or the house- bed.

Payne (we prefer the more generally known name) looked neither to the right nor to the left, but straight forward and upawards It wa  evident that to him the crowd was no- thing, his own thoughts everything. His face might be likened to that of a buildeb of castles inthe air. Fear therewas none, no more than on the face of a sleeping in- fant; braggadocia, or the morbid vanity that so often supplies coure, was not to be read in the quiet dreamng eye, where the old wildness alone had fled; and as the sun faced him as truly a he faced it, the photographer whose irment stood in a window of the wester wall will hand down Payne to postrilty with a face on which no man could read either re- morse for past crime or the fear of pre- sent punishment. The memory of his horrid crime,which hadappalled a nation, was lost in contemplating his beatrig, which at the very foot of the caffold a soldier who had braved death from Chat- tanooga to Savannah styled right regal Last, and In every wayleast, came Harold, with bloodless, sallow ceeks, still sufii- cietly self contained to walk or hobble as well as hisshackler would pelmit, and, attended by Dr. Olds, hetoo, monnted the stairs and sat between the quaking Atze- rot and the quiet Payne. TH THANKe AND PRAYERS O THE PEISONERB. When they were all seated Mr. Gillett stepped forth and said:- - G entlemen, the prisoner, Lewis Thorn- ton Powell, known as Payne, requests me, on this occmion to say for him that hethus publicly and sincerely thanks General Hartranft and all the other officers and soldiers who have had charge of him, and all who have ministered to his want, for their unvarying kindness and atention to him. Not an nrldnd word was ever spo- ken, not an unbecoming gesture has ever been made towards him." Still gazing at the passing cloud sat Payne, no word of approval or disap- proval, no gesture did he make till agan the reverend gentleman spoke, saying: "Almighty God, we commend this soul into thy hands, depending upon the mer- its of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has pro. mised unto us eternal life through faith in Him. Grant us forgiveness of his sins, an easy pMsage out of this world, and if con- sistent with Thy purposes of mercy, re- ceive him into Thy everlasting kingdom;   l   I ., 1ajB r=J aBd thI we aok through Jam Christ, ow Lordiad RBedemMr. Aman." j ts    .?  joined, qietly. but D   sm   B wLd   aend said: W ^ PM ld - fl tt b M y ^ je-  t o s d d Sft wMS's tft  -'ai 1orih h-  aThe wmif the trea  r  bard, and the wagaof sin i death; but if we con- fes or sins God thinks it just to forgive us and clea1ses uwfi&amp;ozull ur ghtaeiisnesa, I for Cirist came to save ti"nnr.

Lord God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, have mercy upon him and grant him Thy peace. Amen', PREPARATION FOR THE EXECUTION. The preachers having ended, an order inaudible from below was given, and Payne slowly walked forward to the rope allotted to him; then stepped forth Mrs. Surrat, aided by her reverend ad- visers, who had read to her a portion of the Catholic ritual prepared for such occasions. Then, at the other end of the platform, rose Atzerot, quivering in every nerve, his knees knocking to- gether, his arms trembling even in their muscles; and last again came forth Har- old, less demonstrative of terror, but only less pale than Mrs. Surrat, over whose face there began to steal an ex- pression of resignation. The arms of all four were tied above the elbows with strips of white muslin. Men have issued from imprisonment of years with whit- ened locks and from shipwrecks with shattered reasons; but Atzerot appa-   rentlr duferteJ mor in those si*teet minutes thatelapsed from his F te.;nir the yrd to the time of his being led forwrd to the rope than was ever endured in the Bale or in St. Marks. :heyes sto d ut, his soiouldersdroop ed, ard no aspen ever trei le* as he did ftom twoto head.

Surrat seemrg less and les terrified, a btte to te tying with no aplpewrce of cooseioness. The othr strips of mnlin werebrought forthto tie the legs between ancle and knee. THE FATAL NOOSE. Thenover the headof eachwapassed th&amp;etal noose. Paynebent  seifunlly to i t,s if he were assaming a crown, and when it eireled his powerful throat he drew himself up, and turning his head slightly,addressed some quiet words to the officer who still held the rope. To all present it was the execn- tion of a murderer; to the murderer it evidently was the coronation of a mar- tyrdom, and the noose an aareola of glory. None resisted the rope. I  THE CAP OF DOOM. Then over the face and head of each was placed a cap of white muslin shaped. somewhat like a jockey's skull cap, but large enough to enclose face and head, and long enough to reach below the chin, and now the pent up fear of A1- zerot breaks forth in words and he ex- claimed: "Gentlemen, beware!" And as Harold's cap was pulled on last of all, Atzerot again burst forth-  "Good-bye, gentlemen!" At half-past one o'clock, as the min- isters moved back, Atzerot again spoke:- "May we all meet in anotherworld." THE TRAP SPRUNG. A moment after the officials drew  back, and down fell the trap, and sway-. ing to fro swung the four bodies. HOW THEY DIED. There was no struggle on the part. of Mrs. Surrat. She hangs and swings as if within the dark folds of her puffed dress no life had ever been. A ba' of , old clothes it might bebut for that flesh f we see between the rope and the capo Atzerot still shakes as if the fear of  death were to continue beyond it, anA d r1  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6976-00000049"/> ,oulivig consciousness itself. Harold rstrgglea--his chest heaves.  Payne slowly draws himself up till he assumes for a second the shape of a man sitting in a rather low chair, his thighs form- ing a right angle with his body, and the former orming a similer angle with the portion of his legs from the knee down- wards. He straightens again, but the broad chest heaves and swells, andthere is a sort of writhing of the body on the hips. It is twenty-seven minutes and fifteen seconds after one. Six minutes and a half have they swung there, ahid again a spasmodic curving of the body and bending of the lower parts proves Payne still alive, but it is the last. If death must, for the safety of society, be inflicted on the assassin, for the sake of civilization let some inore summary means of inflicting it be devised. SYMPATHY FOR MRS. SURRAT. Until the drop fell, a general belief existed, shared in by the military, that Mrs. Surrat would be reprieved, and had a reprieve come even when the rope had been adjusted around her neck--it would have surprised no one. THE BEARING OF PAYNE did surprise many. The absence of all vanity -or repulsive indifference, joined to his dra- pery, caused many to regret that such a man should have merited such a doom. THE FOUR BODIES hang straight and motionless as plumb lines, the red sun pouring his rays with fierce in- ;sity upon the dead and the living. Under   the oppressive heat the spectators still lin. gered around the corpses, till orders were issued to clear the court yard, leaving there- in only a few members of the press and the soldiers and officers, together with Dr. Otis, United States Volunteers, and Dr. Wood- ward, United States Army, and Dr. Porter, United States Army. It was then within five minutes of two o'clock. THE EXAMNATION OF THE BODIES. The doctors then examined the bodies commencing with Mrs. Surrat and ending with Atzerot. Having pronounced them dead, Captain Roth then ordered his men to prepare to take the bodies down, and some ascended the scaffold with knives, while others stood below to catch them. They were cut down successively-first Atzerot, then Harold, next Payne, and last Mrs. Sur- rat. COFFINED AND BURIED. The four boxes prepared for coffins were then brought forward, and the corpses being laid upon them, another examination was made, ahd it being' perfectly evident that life was extinct in all, they were placed each in his narrow house and buried in the four yawning holes prepared for them. Our story is ended. Jefferson Davis, one of our characters, yet lingers in his dungeon awaiting a trial which can have but one ending-such an ending as we have described. Poor Annie Surrat has retired, broken- hearted, to a cloister, to pass the rest of her sad life. Her guilty brother is a Cain-like wanderer in a foreign clime-better for him that he were dead.
